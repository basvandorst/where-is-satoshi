For one thing, I imagine they would be disinclined to have many small stakeholders. They will be able to clear a large portion of the debt by offering equity to holders of large amounts of bfx. Secondly they will be inclined to control to some extent the people that are owners, for strategic and regulatory reasons. This might mean you might have to have large amounts of independent capital, or be an investor recognised by regulators, or some such.

First non-bitcoin focused source reporting this afaics. The whole thing seems to be making fewer waves than I expected, maybe down to the fact that steam themselves have not come out with a press release or any promotion on this. Interesting that they're not inclined to advertise it, could be down to the fact that this is targeted at emerging economies. I wonder how they will deal with promotion there, will they be advising people on how to obtain and manage coins?

The page I linked shows the "level 2" order book, which is a central book where larger players make orders. As I understand it there are other more local order books hosted by separate brokers, so the whole order book is made up of several distinct order books. That's my understanding and I don't know any more.

This is a pretty remarkable structure, the bids seem very uniform, making it seem likely to me that they are mostly from a single player.

Ah right, I remember now reading something along those lines. To be fair, I don't think any of the other exchanges have much more credible reputations.

My suggestion: get an account with bitpay. They have all the tools you need, you can set up an interface on the tablet. You can access the btc through bitpay, or have them exchange it for you to CHF, and they can send the CHF to your bank account (with some minimum amount). You can combine these two options and retain some of the BTC if you like.

I'm guessing their intention is to have higher fees and then offer these rebates to people for attracting more users and volume to the exchange via referral bonuses etc. It could work, and a fee below 0.5% is still pretty low.

This does bring to mind exactly how pivotal bitpay now is in the bitcoin economy, it would be very bad news if their service was compromised in a way that lead to losses for clients (if that is possible). I think they are doing a great job, but it would be better for the ecosystem if there were more competition, and a broader distribution of the business.

If you're going to be trading in and out of the market, the absolute price level of the exchange you're trading at doesn't really matter. You can buy your coins at coinbase, move them to gox, daytrade away to your hearts content, and then withdraw the coins when you want to stop. You could do this on any exchange, choose the one with the best combination of low fees, high volume and away you go.

I suppose the reason I pick up on it is that, trying to explain the randomness of this phenomenon by reducing it to the one word reply "Oh that's just variance." doesn't actually help anyone understand it. Anyone who doesn't grok statistics, probability, randomness etc. (and there are many of those) will hear that and not gain much in understanding, in fact it might even set them back. Probability is tricky and cannot be reduced to one word, we all need to make the effort to use the right words when clarifying things.

The USD data appears to be directly from bitstamp.
I guess they convert the bitstamp USD quote to other currencies using the forex rates. Really cool. I've tried a few currencies with success.
@_date: 2014-07-24 13:42:15
Some notes on their regulatory status:
1) Their TOS states that they are incorporated in Canada, and fall under Ontarian legal jurisdiction.
2) Highlighted in their TOS:
"Bitcoins sent to Coinsetter by U.S. consumers are are never sent to other people or third parties and are only withdrawn to a Bitcoin address owned by the original sender."
This is clearly a nod to the NYDFS proposed regulations, and could very likely become a standard for bitcoin businesses. A big change, but not catastrophic as I see it, as once withdrawn you can still send your coins where you like.

I am pretty certain that the intention of the devs is to have a market which helps drive fees down, I'm sure the system they release will do this to all best estimates. However it is impossible to be certain because of the organic nature of the network and the system they are developing.
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:33:58
Yeah well, that's just like, your opinion man.
But seriously, this is just an empirical observation, gaining support from the performance of BTCUSD this year, which can be explained by many other more short term factors. 
The fact that bitcoin (not to mention gold) maintains value as a store of value and medium of exchange suggests that while governmental support does add value to currencies (for obvious reasons), state agnostic commodities can still act as currency in a practical sense to some extent.
Given bitcoins young age, I think the people claiming that the short term performance implies failure for all time are extremely short sighted, but this is a huge problem with the investment world at large, and the rest of society.

@_date: 2014-01-05 19:50:00
I think this would be a good idea. It would essentially mean that if you use this to try to convince a business to use bitcoin that you are operating as a sales rep for bitpay, but I personally have no problem with that, and we all know the connection between supporting bitcoin and supporting associated companies. I also think it's quite possible that businesses are more receptive when they know there is a name and a brand standing behind something, it's much closer to what they are used to.

Interesting deduction, but that's not the case, I'm not trading reactively at all. I just don't see why when an exchange can be automated and exist mostly if not solely on the internet trading hours should be limited at all. I would like to see markets able to react to events at any time, working hours will become more diverse to handle this.

It's not clear to me if any coin is actually passing through the bot owner's hands. The payment is sent directly to eternal-summer-sale. If the bot was written by EPS then they are handling the money. If not, then the payments are just fulfilling orders made by the EPS account of the bot author. Even in this case, all the keys will be in the authors EPS account or email address, so retrievable.

Crypto may be part of the thinking here, but I think a larger part of it is likely to be the paypal competitors like gwallet and ipay which ebay has up to now been unable to accept. This is the conflict of interest that Icahn talks about. Good for bitcoin in the long run in terms of adoption with both companies, but in the short term we'll just see a much more competitive payments landscape on the web. Paypal has challengers. Sooner or later one of those big companies will adopt bitcoin, so far it looks likely to be paypal.

The internet is not decentralised. Despite this, it offers a habitat to decentralised technology for the first time in history, by allowing global, near-instant, near-free communication. Bittorrent was the first such application, bitcoin is the second.
@_date: 2014-06-10 13:56:34
Clearly, but it did adopt them as the obvious default from the offset. Some large markets are traded 24 hours (e.g. forex etc.) but they still close at the weekend etc. I think in the long run bitcoin will help to open up the exchange industry and allow for longer trading times for assets with global appeal, and 24/7/365 trading will not be unusual as it is now.

At 19:13, George Frost a lawyer of BitStamp said:
"There are some banks that are really hostile to the whole industry and I think everybody knows who they are so I'm not going to go through that, and certainly some banks are butting pressure on European banks to drop all bitcoin businesses, and you know, that's probably not, that probably is a legal issue, an anti-trust issue but it's a separate topic."

The interesting thing about this is that although regulation establishes hurdles making it difficult and slow to start a business, it adds serious value to any company who does make it over all those hurdles in the form of the trust users can have that a) the practices of the company are being heavily overseen so hopefully they are not allowed to be lax about security or technology, so that the risk of loss theft or lack of access to funds is lowered and b) that even if funds are lost or stolen, the owner is more likely to be sufficiently capitalised to meet the losses. All this means people will be able to have faith in using exchanges and wallets much more. There will always be exchanges and wallets operating outside the US who will be able to offer a less heavily regulated but slightly less trustworthy service, but if there were just a handful of companies offering seriously regulated and thus trustworthy services, that would help push bitcoin forward a hell of a lot.

I tried running bitcoind on a pi, but it crashed consistently after a few hours. I think bitcoind also consumes quite a lot of memory, which causes problems. The pi is just ever so slightly underpowered for this, and is pretty particular about hardware in the first place. I think this is a great idea, and someone should try to produce it. There are pi-like devices which are just slightly more high powered which would run a node with no problems and so would provide a more robust solution. Arduino and some other one I can never remember the name of.
edit: running a node on a pi can be done, but it's apparently pretty tricky to get configured correctly, because you need to skirt the limits of the capabilities of the device.

It's a point worth making but you're stretching it much too far. I only need to read the headline to know that in this case at least fiat is clearly not worse. 
Compare the headline stat to this article 
Now it's slightly dated and quite likely their methods are imperfect, but from their figures, the proportion of bitcoin users controlling half the economy is at most a tenth of a percent. Even assuming they are off by say a factor ten, we're not even close to the 10% for GBP.
Now personally I expect the distribution of bitcoin to improve drastically over time (come on satoshi proof of burn), but no rational person can now say that fiat is worse.

Of course for a complete picture we should also consider new banks which have been founded, but probably your point still stands. 
@_date: 2014-07-04 13:56:27
"To address risk driver a) – i.e. that anyone, including criminals, can anonymously create a VC without being held responsible for any changes made to the VC protocol, or other core elements of the VC scheme by others at a later stage – the creation of an entity that is accountable to the regulator would need to be a mandatory requirement for a VC scheme to be regulated as a financial service and for it to be allowed to interact with existing regulated financial services.
The entity would be called the ‘scheme governance authority’, which is a non-governmental entity that establishes and governs the rules for the use of a particular VC scheme.24 It is a legal person, and is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the central transaction ledger, the protocol, and any other core functional component of the scheme. The scheme governance authority would be required to comply with regulatory and supervisory requirements of various kinds to mitigate identified risks.
A governance authority may, at first, appear incompatible with the conceptual origins of VCs as a decentralised scheme that does not require the involvement of a central bank or government. However, the mandatory creation of a scheme governance body does not imply that VC units have to be centrally issued. This function can remain decentralised and be run through, for example, a protocol and a transaction ledger. If it is true that the decentralised VC schemes are secure, it should be possible for market participants to establish themselves as scheme governance authorities. However, if a legal person is not able to exercise authority over market participants and is therefore unaccountable to a regulator for compliance purposes, it would be unreasonable to expect a regulator to guarantee integrity in their place. In the case of a centralised VC scheme, the issuer of the scheme arguably already controls the core elements of the scheme."

As In understand it this is not specified in the protocol. Any of the three subsets of inputs you quote could be used to construct a valid transaction. As such it would be entirely a choice of the client as to which subset to choose. 
A client might decide to choose the inputs producing the least change, or the oldest inputs, or all the inputs. All could be used to produce a valid transaction, but the fee required by each transaction might differ (i.e. older inputs would likely require a lower fee, a transaction with many inputs might require a higher fee).

He could mean that each time you check the state of your storage, i.e. check that your private key is still intact, you make it less secure. In theory this is probably true, each time you go to the bank to look in your lock box you risk getting the key stolen. This is a very small effect though, and surely is surmountable.
@_date: 2014-08-07 10:40:21
Well time will tell. I think their main focus in order to attract volume should and must be opening to a wider US customer base, I guess they're working hard with banks etc. to make this happen. The outcome of that is many times more important than fees with regard to winning the race for trading volume.
@_date: 2014-10-08 11:45:46
I agree. I think your suggestion would not make any difference to the long term properties, but would reduce the volatility shocks. You could imagine this would help adoption over time, but in 100 years it won't matter.
In terms of the reasons: the current choice was made only for simplicity. Firstly because it's pretty easy to understand but also significantly because the implementation for this choice is beautifully simple. It involves shifting the bits of a number to the right, one very simple operation, not even any math. Any other choice would increase the code complexity here significantly, and for such a crucial piece of the protocol, you could argue simplicity is very valuable here.
In theory I would be in favour of the change you suggest, but it would require some significant academic work, and some really extensive coding and testing, and for such a central piece of the machine, might not be worth the effort.

Hi Matt, best of luck as always.
But dude, trading happens off the blockchain. The only way to identify even the addresses involved for sure would be to gain access to gain access to bitstamp's accounts. 
There are doubtless many many transactions of ~30k which could be argued are involved in this trade, but there's absolutely no way to know for sure without extra information, and that's pretty thin on the ground.

Also, I don't understand how people believe that bitcoin will end fractional reserve. Fractional reserve started with gold, and will be entirely possible with bitcoin, and just as likely to be a feature of any future economy.

I agree. The size of the bitcoin market determines how important it is to merchants. A higher price would mean a higher $ volume traded on exchanges, meaning more attractive to professional trading institutions, meaning lower volatility in the long run. A larger market means more market depth, allowing larger and larger institutions to adopt bitcoin in their business without having a large impact on the price. 
The price is important. It will come.

I think winning over Guardian readers will be an important milestone in Britain. In principle they should be very interested because of their disapproval of the banking and finance sector, but they are also torn by their disapproval of tax avoidance and the fear that bitcoin may support this.

That seems over complex in my opinion. Also a potential candidate and worth testing, but I prefer the slower steadier decay of my above, and I think it's more likely to be accurate. All should definitely be tested, but given the limited data up to now on the decay of the growth it will not be possible yet to distinguish. I think my above is the simplest assumption which should be the starting point. Alternatively you could just add a negative quadratic term to the exponent, and try to identify that, as that is how any more complex model would be manifested at early times, but that would have similar logical problems that the current model has.

I agree except with regard to satoshi. It's still a large anvil hanging over bitcoin that he in theory could still control something of the order of 10 percent of all coins. If he could provide proof that he has relinquished control over his coins that would allow much greater confidence in the currency. If he ever tried to sell or give away many of his coins the short to medium term impact on the economy would be significant.

I agree, kraken did a lot of things right, but they also seem to have missed opportunities to be really excellent. Their main failure was never managing to attract any significant USD volume.

@_date: 2015-01-04 22:18:30
Actually in the long run I don't agree. People learn to ignore short term price movements, and the price returns to it's natural position as regards supply and demand at the time. It has a big impact on the market in the short term, but pretty soon it's forgotten about.

People assume the current barriers to entry to the mining business will persist forever, and so mining is inevitably centralised. I don't agree with that supposition. Bitshares seems to embrace a certain level of centralisation, there is no need for that IMO. Anyway, if I'm wrong, bitshares will grow faster than bitcoin, time will tell.

I'm not exactly sure what "Level 2" means, (even [this]( provides very little insight, we're into the arena of the obfuscated financial world here), but it's clear that that order book does not show the full picture.
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:04:26
How many people will want to hold stock in an entity which must remain underground? As far as I see, vast regulatory overhaul notwithstanding, colored coins will be a very limited phenomenon. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:30:08
Fair enough, I don't think that number will reach 100%, but I'd say it could easily get up to 70/80%.
@_date: 2015-05-27 12:51:42
Well it remains to be seen for sure, but two potential benefits which I think will make coinbase the dominant exchange:
1) low fees: they charge a maker-taker fee, meaning below market limit orders are free, and taking an existing order costs only 0.25%.
2) volume: accessible to only half of the U.S. coinbase is already matching or exceeding the volume of any exchange excepting the CNY only exchanges. I think they will have much more volume by the end of the year, and while this will be mostly centred on the USD pair, I imagine the EUR pair will also exceed kraken's volume. granted this is a bit of a chicken and egg issue but i think people will be attracted to a centre of volume.
@_date: 2016-03-16 23:52:51
I'm in favour of on-chain scaling, but I don't think extreme thin-blocks is a very significant change. Decreases bandwidth by only a small fraction. Headers only mining is much more significant as it tackles propagation latency, which is important for miners. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:24:16
Well fair enough, but there are now roughly ten exchanges with significant volume who are all far ahead of you. I'd like to see you folks address the real reasons people are not using your service, and what you're doing to address those concerns. I'm sure you know the appetite for a full US exchange is huge, and the first mover advantage will be huge. My guess is that Kraken for example is likely to be several steps ahead of you in terms of regulatory preparation, you should be trying to convince people that that is not the case, so that they have some expectation that you will be the first out of the blocks.

It's easy to make an exchange. It should be clear by now that it's hard to make a secure exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:12:29
I've been waiting for an analysis like this for months. The fact that 37% of mined coins would cover their cost is also worrying, because mining is going to become more competitive now that it is more stable, meaning miners will have to dump more of their coins to cover costs, meaning there may be more room below for the price.
If you think about it more, in this way the arms race in mining can explain the crazy bubble in 2013. Those who were profitable were crazy profitable, and didn't need to sell any coins to break even, leading to a massive decrease in the usual supply to the market.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:59:14
It's quite clear what tiny means in this sense. You have a tiny share of the current market. There's no reason to expect your share will grow when that market grows. To grow your share you have to make progress in the areas in which you are behind.

That's also true. In that sense, I think these two effects were a double whammy the likes of which we will never see again. Future halvings will obviously decrease supply and have a corresponding impact on the market, but I don't think 2013 will be repeated. The only exception would be if we achieved true critical mass in consumer adoption but I think it's just as reasonable to expect that price impacts of adoption should be fairly smooth.
@_date: 2016-03-17 08:50:17
50% is a much larger number than I have been led to believe. Thin blocks does not reduce the transaction relaying traffic, which constitute the largest portion of the bandwidth. I have heard numbers closer to 15%. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 20:12:54
At this point my concern would be that they're not taking enough time. Given the weakness that the theft pointed out, clearly it should be a big job to fix and properly secure the hot wallet, requiring significant testing. If they really are rebuilding from the ground up that's great, but that should require a huge amount of time and testing. 
I would prefer to see them spend a couple of days or weeks letting people withdraw their funds (ensuring security) and then spend a few months rebuilding. Anything else seems knee-jerk to me.

No it doesn't. 
You say "the order book", but it must be that there are several distinct order books, as you imply in your attempted comparison of levels 1 and 2.
If you could clearly explain which order book this level 2 refers to (i.e. on which platform this book exists) and why e.g. the otcmarkets data feed refers details of trades which are not happening on this order book that would be a start. Then you could explain exactly where all these other trades are occurring, and who is permitted to partake in each particular order book then you would clear up my confusion.

How does majority rule equate to rule by committee? To me these ideas are almost completely opposite. Regardless of satoshi's intent majority rule is a fundamental feature of the system he started.

So there are 3 books, yet all of these participants are quoted in the L2 book? What are the other trades that are quoted by otcmarkets? I assume they are trades occurring on other (L1?) markets, but you haven't actually said that anywhere. By whom is the L2 order book actually hosted, by NASDAQ? And the L1 markets are those on the other brokers who act as a relay between the retail investors and the NASDAQ L2 order book? Clear answers to those queries would clear up my ignorance.

Mr. Back has exited the realm of logic. If the majority cannot overrule then the minority, then it follows that the minority can overrule the majority. Any honest conscientious person must conclude that clearly majority rule is preferable to minority rule. And it is upon this principle that bitcoin is built. The ability of 51% to control the network fundamentally enshrines this principle. The idea of a 51% *attack* does not indicate that any exertion of the majority rule principle is malicious and to be avoided, but that any attempt to attack the fundametal idea of currency by e.g. doublespending by a 51% party would constitute an attack. The majority exercising their 51% right to change the protocol as they desire, in a way which does not attack the fundamental operation of the currency is not an attack, it is an implementation of majority rule, which is a fundamental principle of the protocol. The decision of hardfork implementations to require say 75% is a sensible and conservative increase of the power of the minority, but going further to say 90% would be irrational and give too much influence to the minority over the majority.
@_date: 2016-03-09 16:20:25
Power is a rate of energy change. The block reward value in coins is the rate of growth of the bitcoin money supply. 
Comparing the two gives the cost in energy of growing the money supply at any given time. 
Taking a time integral makes no sense, in particular integrating over the whole history makes no sense.

There's no real significance. It's a comparison of arbitrary numbers. The value of all bitcoin in circulation is still like 3 orders of magnitude away from the value of all gold. If there is any significance it's purely psychological, and potentially useful in attracting the interest of easily confused investors who would otherwise not pay any attention.
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:42:46


Clearly it's political, and in my opinion the only acceptable political system is one in which the majority rules. Anything else may begin as the empowerment of a group of benevolent experts or good leaders, but without the ability of the majority to remove them, they will always eventually deviate from the path which is in the common interest.
I have no explicit desire to fire anyone, but what I believe has happened here is that a group of people who were given apparent custodianship of the system have departed from the path of common interest. If the majority expresses a desire to take a different path, then the leaders must return to that path, or eventually be replaced. Ideally I would like all developers to listen to the voice of the majority and take the path they request, but in reality this will not happen because the voice of the users will not be unified.
This is indeed politics, as far as I'm concerned it is one of the most interesting and beautiful political systems in history. There is no constitution or justice system, only the common desire of all parties to make the protocol successful, but differing ideas of what that means.

Thanks for bringing this up. Though you are right about the two distinct applications, surely the rule change would not be approved without there already being a decision (announced or not) for the fund to be approved. The rule change references the fund specifically, and does not relate to anything except the coin fund. It would be ridiculous and outrageous for the rule change to be approved and the fund rejected, I don't think they would ever do it. Further, by the information we have on the tinkering going on in both applications, it seems pretty clear that these two applications are being considered as very tightly related. In my view the most likely outcome is a joint decision being announced on both applications. In the absence of this, an approval on the rule change can really mean nothing else but the fund will be approved.

I'm pretty shocked at the level of support after the rejection. Doesn't make much sense to me. Either the market placed an extremely low likelihood on COIN approval (like &lt;10%), or the market underestimated the price appreciation that approval would bring, or the market is currently over confident and we'll see a slide next week when all (I don't have a good handle on how much there was, but I'm certain there was a non-neglible amount) the quasi-professional money which came in over recent weeks flows back out again due to the rejection.

To begin with, on this point you totally misread me, that's not what I meant at all, I think what I wrote was not unclear.


51% of the hashing network control bitcoin. That is a fact of the network. The viability of the protocol depends on the fact that the miners are incentivised to follow the desires of the investors and users, through their mutual desire for the currency value to be maintained and increased. As such I believe it is the majority of users and investors in bitcoin who held the ultimate control.
@_date: 2015-05-14 12:27:36
Not if I orphan your tip.
@_date: 2016-01-29 03:07:13
Ok I think we disagree on a lot of things. Regardless of your opinions on politics, the protocol and ecosystem is built on the principle of majority rule. If you don't recognise this, it's quite possible that you find yourself in the minority and left behind by the whole system, or maybe you remain in the majority and not left behind. Regardless of where you find yourself, the majority will rule.
edit: but thanks for the discussion man, and best of luck.
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:23:20
There is no concept of natural rights in the bitcoin protocol. Do you want to resort to some higher court to arbitrate? The protocol relies on the concept that benevolent majority rule is implemented through the actions of the majority of the mining network.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:38:32
IMO the problem is really the signal that is being given by the core team that hard forks, particularly to increase the blocksize, are off the table indefinitely. They seem to be planning to focus on the L2 solutions like LN exclusively, and hope that on-chain scaling is never required, or at least kept to an absolute minimum. Now I and almost everyone would hope that this could work, but I'm pretty sceptical, and even I were confident it would work, I would still object to the assumption being made that the direction of bitcoin could be changed in this way, not by open competition between the systems, or by choice of the users, but by central dictat. A 2mb hardfork would indeed be a one-time increase, but at least it would illustrate that hard-forks need not be dangerous if done correctly, and also that the community is not abandoning the scaling method that has brought us to where we are, i.e. on-chain, and also that further future scaling hard-forks are on the table and will be deployed when necessary. None of this precludes SW and LN, but there is resentment that the network as-is is being crippled and it is being insisted that we radically change the scaling method to something completely different and entirely unproven. Now if LN etc. proves a massive success on something like litecoin then the story will/would be different, but that's still a pretty massive if IMO. The middle ground of a 2mb+SW hardfork would certainly be enough to regain the confidence of a large majority and achieve the most important aims. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:12:02
Totally disagree. Why would the rule be allowed if the fund is not going to be allowed? The rule change is specifically about the fund. Why would they even consider allowing the rule change if the fund was never going to exist? They need to make a decision on the fund before the rule change can even be considered.

It's certainly what I like about bitcoin, but it's clear that many users are happy to place (even unregulated) 3rd parties in control of their funds (coinbase etc.). That seems likely to me likely to continue, if not grow as these institutions become more trusted. Whether you or I want it to happen won't affect whether it happens or not. As long as people are willing to put a 3rd party in control of their funds, and are tempted to deposit their funds in return for interest received (this will always be the case) fractional reserve will persist.

@_date: 2016-01-29 04:02:48
Actually I don't agree with that. The majority can decide to do whatever they want in bitcoin. There is nothing fundamentally preventing blacklisting or similar through the protocol, if the majority wished it. What can be said is that a minority can not overrule or censor anyone. Any decision must have significant consensus. I see the consensus system in bitcoin most akin to direct democracy rather than anything else.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:37:58




So wait, which is it. Are we still considering hard-forks or not? To me, the anti-hardfork atmosphere is a real problem. I understand they're difficult, but have we really chickened out at the first hurdle? Hard-forks will be necessary and must be confronted. With proper leadership, communication and consensus I don't believe they could be properly dangerous. Yes they will by definition lead to a split, but the right hard fork will converge on a single chain, and if done properly this could be quite smooth, bitcoin has been hard forked in the past. I don't think any future fork would be quite that straight forward, but I certainly think we can do better than the ETC fork (where one huge party had a massive incentive to preserve the minority chain). 
As regards the roadmap, well that's fair enough, but in that case why has there been no centrist proposal for a 2mb+SW HF? IMO with proper leadership that would achieve massive majority (not to mention was actually agreed upon by some parties over a year ago), and yet this is not forthcoming. It rings a bit hollow to say HFs are on the roadmap, while bending over backwards to avoid a SW HF and popularise the notion that hard forks are dangerous and should be avoided at all costs.


That's good, but even those efficiencies will not clearly not provide enough capacity for very long, block-size increase will be necessary very soon in any case, why not provide the simple and the advanced solutions together?


On this point we're agreeing. My point was that the one-time increase from a 2mb HF would be a bit more significant than the one-time increase from SW exactly because it would illustrate that explicit block-size increases are on the table and will also be seriously considered in the future, as you say.
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:10:16


Ok, I had thought there had been one or two. On taking a look it seems you're right, although the other events were pretty similar to HFs. 




Any system of people will have and need leaders. Bitcoin has plenty, there are leaders (although no-one has taken full responsibility) in core, and more obviously in BU etc. I'm not saying leadership per se is necessarily a good thing, but to bring people together to agree on something someone has to stand up and argue the case in a certain direction.
Agree that maximum consensus is necessary for a HF. That's why I'd like to see someone from core to stand up and bring people together under one proposal. I'd argue that if a 2mb+SW HF had been seriously proposed something like 18 months ago it could've been done already. I still think with the right argument this fork could achieve a serious majority.
The reason I think this is necessary, is because otherwise we risk a much more perilous split. Miners have no incentive to keep the chain so crippled, and there is now a lot of support for a complete sundering of the coin. 
IMO we are going to get closer to the brink, with neither side conceding any ground, leading to a serious bear market, until somebody stands up with a proposal that can bring people together to avoid disaster.
Anyway, I'm out for now, I think we have big disagreements, we could probably talk all day. In the end this will be decided in the mines and in the markets, best of luck to us all.
@_date: 2016-03-08 19:40:48

@_date: 2017-03-02 11:39:46
Given (as I argue [here]( ) that an approval on the rule change will almost certainly mean that the fund will be approved (they will probably be decided on simultaneously), the date of the approval of the fund is not all that important. Also, the price impact of the decision will arrive immediately, it will not need to wait for the actual arrival of the operation of the ETF. The market knows well what will happen if and when the ETF begins operation, the only question is whether it is actually allowed or not. Bottom line: if the rule change is approved then the price impact will be immediate and extremely positive, but also could lead to a sustained bull market for the next year or two, vice versa if it is not approved we will fall back quite a bit almost immediately.
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:03:49
Well let's not presume that yet. How will we ever know if a hard fork has consensus if we never give them a chance! Hard fork proposals that don't reach critical mass do absolutely no harm, we should not be afraid of them.

There has been tons of discussion and the disagreement has not been resolved. The conflict can and will only be resolved by the users expressing their opinion through choice of software, i.e. an election i.e. politics. This is how the network was designed and intended.

To me this highlights the upside potential if bitcoin does manage to become better known, used and trusted. We're really not even at the foot of the hill yet. There's no guarantee of how far we can climb, but the potential is huge.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:59:50
Agree with this. Further, if the argument that full blocks is in the interest of miners, wouldn't it make sense to reduce the blocksize and hike fees even higher? Clearly not. The additional utility that increased blocksize gives bitcoin must increase the value sufficiently to increase miner revenue more than the reduction in fees that would result.

Right, fair enough. But I guess that's my point, and that's exactly why its being held up, and other solutions are being supported. Why not enable LN etc. and scale the chain in parallel. If the LN is vastly superior to on-chain transactions, then it will win in a fair fight.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:09:22
How can that necessarily be true? Surely a hard fork with widespread support would go completely smoothly. Why not invite signalling on any hard fork, and if one receives enough support it can be activated with confidence. We should not be afraid of hard forks, we need to identify what upgrade can receive all round support!

If you manage to set up something more secure that'd be great. 
Would be hard to construct an average no? Much easier just to use one, or a set of exchanges.
I'm willing to bet:
Bitcoin will trade below $900 on bitstamp within 48h of the SEC rejecting the COIN ETF. 
if the ETF is approved, no one pays.
if it's rejected and bitstamp doesn't trade below $900 within 48h, i send you 0.05 btc
if it's rejected and bitstamp does trade below $900 within 48h, you send me 0.05 btc

Bitcoin will persist, it cannot be killed. But it can be limited. Moon only comes with widespread consumer adoption, if governments in general turn completely against it, that just won't happen. 
They can't stop bitcoin transactions, but they can definitely shut down significant on-ramps and scare people away. Sure they might not be able to shut down LBTC or similar things, but those kinds of platforms will not be enough to allow significant adoption. They can block all exchanges, and forbid companies from dealing with it. That would be plenty to crush bitcoin and turn it into a mouse that has to run from the broom of persecution. 
Events of today surely back my point up, even the tiniest level of attention from authorities scare people significantly. People in china know that if the PBOC decide to ban it, the party's over. 
Could easily be that some small countries ban it, and it still succeeds in the rest of the world, or that countries split more evenly between acceptance and rejection. Could also be that countries turn against it for some time, but eventually the qualities of bitcoin win out and it becomes accepted. 
But without some level of acceptance from governments, moon never arrives.

It must be pretty likely that they put limits in place to control the capital flight though right? Now that they have relationships and a foothold in the exchanges, what's to stop them placing monthly limits on the amount that can be bought per person?
Not that that would actually kill the potential for bitcoin adoption to actually take hold, but it would limit the potential for its use as an instrument for capital flight, and you can be damn sure that it would freak the chinese investors out 10 times more than a few harmless meetings did this week.

Hi. You're going to get conflicting responses to that question, but here's mine:
It's not. btc1 is software which encodes protocol rules that will implement an upgrade to the protocol. These rules will be incompatible with the previous protocol rules, resulting in a (hard) fork. This is one of the upgrade mechanisms understood to possible within the bitcoin protocol since design and inception. The fork appears as of now to have a supermajority of mining support, but is at least somewhat contentious among users (or redditors at least). Imo the objection seems mostly to be based on a combination of distaste for hard forks in principle, or opposition to the people who agreed this path of action, or the manner in which it was agreed.

It's a hard fork, of bitcoin. The bitcoin protocol need not be static. One of the protocol upgrade mechanisms is (by design and long standing common knowledge) a hard fork, which requires all nodes to upgrade in order to stay on the majority chain. If you're going to contend that hard forks are de facto an invalid mechanism, then I can't argue with you, imo that's just obviously not true. You are free to call each side of the fork whatever you want, I intend to call the 2x side bitcoin.

The dollar has surged in the last week or two, pushing USDCNY to new highs (since about 2008). Interestingly it has now passed the level at which is was held at between 2008 and 2010.

The assumption that more experience and talent inherently makes a certain team the undisputed authority doesn't hold in my opinion. I'm well aware that the well of intelligence, knowledge and ability contained in the core team is superior to that in any other team, and probably will remain so. That doesn't mean that I think they're always right however, and despite my lack of experience and detailed knowledge, I'm entitled to my opinion on key questions about the growth of this system, and as a moderate hodler that opinion is relevant to the extent that my actions can impact the market. On this key question of how to grow this system, I align much more with the BU policy, and this to me is more relevant than the experience and ability within core. If they want my support this is the most important question, and anyone who cites "lines of code written" by any particular team, is missing the point entirely.

Ironically, the strength of the dollar has been a contributing factor to the strength of bitcoin over recent weeks and months. When less solid currencies depreciate with respect to the dollar, people place more value on an instrument like bitcoin which allows them to skirt capital controls and reduce exposure to their weaker currencies (clearly in particular I'm referring to the Yuan). So for my part, I'm hoping for a strong dollar which will further strengthen bitcoin. Thankfully that's what I expect to see in the coming months and years.

Yeah, but I think a certain volatility is inevitable, if bitcoin continues to prove itself successful. Think of the last 6 months, relative stability. But in that case, bitcoin manages to prove to some more of it's doubters that it can be a successful currency, the userbase grows, and the price goes up. I think that until bitcoin has come closer to saturating its potential, a certain base long term volatility is inevitable.

This is how I see it:
If bitfinex never opens up USD again, then either:
a) They were/are insolvent for some reason.
b) They've been shut down by the feds etc.
Case a) I don't think is too likely. The theft, though very large was not imo insurmountable, and given their actions since then, and the profits they were raking in fees, I don't buy that they've totally failed to patch up the hole. 
b) If they're shut down by the feds, then worst case the funds stay locked up for a few months or years, but eventually get returned possibly with some minor haircut. 
Otherwise it's possible the current situation remains in place for a few months or a year, but will eventually be resolved, the only change being finex will have lost their place as the top exchange.
I expect some people think they're most likely insolvent, but for now I don't share that analysis, though I'm not risking any big fraction on it :).

Banking problems continue to hamper bitfinex, and the resulting reduction in their share of trading volume has now seen several exchanges surpass their 24h trading volume, and several more close to achieving the same. 
According to bitcoinity, bitfinex has been the dominant exchange in terms of volume over the last 30 days or so, and the dominant USD exchange since the demise of mtgox. 
Combined with the reduction in volumes at the CNY exchanges, this dynamic now means that the regulated on-shore USD exchanges now together comprise a much larger fraction of the USD volume. 
In terms of the maturing of the bitcoin ecosystem as described by US regulators such as the SEC, this can only be seen as progress.

actually, a bitcoin address is only added to the blockchain when it receives a transaction. we all likely have tens of addresses stored in our (HD or otherwise) wallets which are not indexed on the blockchain because they have received no transactions. 
if OP never advertised these addresses or received transactions, they are on no word list anywhere, except on OP's computer. 
doesn't seem any better than using any other password generator, except that it's an easy standard and there is some address management software already existing.

I'm not sure about all cases, but in the case of one of the largest exchanges which allows shorting, bitfinex, all shorts must be funded by borrowing XBT from another party on the exchange, there is a whole swaps market allowing this. So in the case where the party who shorts XBT walks away, he is simply defaulting on his debt (in XBT) to the party who made him the loan in the first place.

Investors are paid using revenues from new investors. As such it depends on rapid growth in order to persist. It definitely seems it has achieved large substantial growth. Sooner or later, the growth slows, payouts get smaller until eventually the scheme operator pulls the plug and the scheme collapses, with most later investors losing basically everything. In this case a lot of the cash is held in bitcoin. As such the recent price rise has probably helped the earnings of the scheme, fuelling it further. The price will not rise forever though, when the selling pressure from profit takers exceeds the buying pressure, the scheme will run out of fuel and begin to unravel, at which point the buying turns to selling and the process reverses. Can you tell I'm quite worried about this? Not least for the poor suckers involved. However, all bitcoiners are now embroiled in the dynamics of this scheme.

Hi Fred, great work with coinbase. When people ask you about the current price surge, do you not feel compelled to at least mention the possibility that it's fuelled by a voracious Ponzi scheme? Seems to me like it's responsible to warn that this scheme brings a lot of short to medium term risk.

Well as I recall, the bulk of the reason that r/btc exists is that people expressing their opinions against the core agenda were not tolerated on r/bitcoin. Many deleted posts and banned users. When the xt and classic clients were launched, discussion and/or support for them were not allowed on r/bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-04 16:47:22
Thanks for the sensible question.
Well it probably boils down to whether you think their scheme is sustainable or not. From the language and explanations on their site, it's pretty clear to me that this is a classic ponzi scheme, except leveraging the internet and bitcoin to inflate to a huge scale. They are relying on constantly attracting new investors in order to achieve their high payouts. This really isn't sustainable, at some point new investment will stall, the money will dry up and the scheme will implode. It could be 2 weeks from now, or 2 years from now, but to me it is inevitable.
Now if you agree that MMM is supplying a lot of new demand from bitcoin, then it seems almost certain that when it implodes, this demand disappears. The price needs demand to be stable to hold a given level, if the demand reduces, then the price must reduce accordingly, the miners are continuously selling to cover their expenses. 
Secondly, if MMM is contributing net supply for bitcoin, then it must be that someone is holding that coin. It is still the case that bitcoin is almost useless as a day to day currency, so these people will eventually want their local cash. When the scheme closes they will have no more reason to hold, and will sell, especially if the uptrend stops, and starts reversing.
Thirdly, assuming this uptrend has been triggered by the increased demand from MMM, but once the trend is started, it feeds itself by drawing in enthusiasm and buyers from everywhere else. If the pressure from MMM disappears or reverses, this enthusiasm from elsewhere will also stall, and likely reverse aswell. You get feedback on the way down (2014), as well as on the way up (2013).
Sure their use of bitcoin does highlight the strength of the technology, but that doesn't take away from the fact that they're running a ponzi scheme and it will die a fiery death. Bitcoin is now in the short to medium term tied to the fate of this scheme.
@_date: 2015-11-04 22:58:57
There's no obvious reason to explain the incredible surge at all.

Okay, but I still think that would spread the pressure across all markets, unless of course the bitcoin market is large enough to be on the same or larger scale than the other FX markets, i.e. bitcoin has grown to truly rival the USD. 
Seems to me the claim equates to saying: If bitcoin grows to become a large global currency, then central banks will have to treat it as a large global currency. Sounds like a pretty plain truism to me. 
I guess maybe the lawyer is highlighting exactly why it would have to be taken seriously if it grows to a truly large scale, but how many orders of magnitude are we from that, like 5?

If this thing is responsible for a large fraction of the bitcoin support, then it is going to hurt bitcoin very hard when it falls apart. A larger currency is not as vulnerable to these things, because it has more support to draw from. Also, this seems to me to be the first 21st century ponzi, taking full advantage of the internet to allow it to scale to a global level, and accessing that global scale would be very important for a ponzi, because the larger it can grow, the longer it will go on. Connecting all the naive disadvantaged people all over the world through the internet in this way has not been done before, and it seems bitcoin is helping this to be achieved (which highlights the power and strength of bitcoin, but in this case I think it will bite us in the ass hard).

Absolutely agree with you. To point out that this is a problem for bitcoin is not to say that it's bitcoin's fault that this is happening, just to say that if a lot of the support for the current rally comes from MMM buyers, then that support will vanish extremely rapidly and turn to panicked selling when this all falls apart. Before this month I was confident we wouldn't see below $200 again. When this collapses, I don't know how low it could go, and the stench of this scheme will be attached to bitcoin for a long time. This will be quite a bit worse than gox I think.

Secondly, I think it will change, unless core changes tack and listens to the concerns of its opponents. 
Anyway thanks for listening, I appreciate that most people that petition you will be pretty much entirely unreasonable.

There are arbitrage opportunities which should tie GBTC to XBTUSD, although they involve significant delays and are only open to certain parties. 
There are special parties who are permitted to deposit XBT with Grayscale and receive GBTC shares in return. 
If the bid for GBTC exceeds the XBTUSD rate, the arbitrage opportunity for any of these parties currently holding GBTC shares with the correct duration is as follows: 
Deposit GBTC onto exchange and sell for high price. Simultaneously buy XBT for USD and deposit with Grayscale receiving GBTC. After 1 year the process can be repeated. 
The arbitrage opportunities exist as they must, it's only that the barriers to entry and delays are very significant. The two rates will track each other to some degree, and as liquidity increases the tether will become stronger and the rates will stay closer. It may take some time, years possibly for the tether to mature.

* Analysis of behaviour of appearances on YouTube, with the added dimension of payment sums being claimed.

Can you find any English language explanation of the internal mechanics? I'd be interested to know who is holding their money in bitcoins within this process, and for how long. Are the bottom level users holding coins, or just the higher up benificiaries. If the bottom level wealth is held in bitcoin, then that is the worst news, they will be the panic sellers. If it's just the higher ups who may be net winners, then I imagine it might not be as bad in the end. That's just my intuition though.

I would argue this is a flawed position. The true peer review which bitcoin ought to, and will, be ruled by is public debate and individual choice, of all users in the ecosystem. Software repos are ultimately controlled (as is only natural) by a small number of people. If any proposal requires approval of these people then bitcoin has become almost entirely centralised. The only valid consensus mechanism is choice between competing implementations and teams, with different ideas. The market will decide which is the best path. I would love for open discussion to be allowed. That discussion may be largely low quality, acrimonious and unproductive, but that's a different problem, both subs are dominated by counter-productive hyperbole, at least in my opinion.

I find it incredibly ironic that people in this community, which as a whole is a huge proponent of the "exit" over "voice" option, would insist that there is no right to "exit" their consensus system. The consensus system of bitcoin is fundamentally based on the blockchain and the token market value, that is where this disagreement will be settled. Certainly the status quo continues to dominate, but that may change.

I guess so, but if it's possible to make the deposits and redemptions to GBTC at any time, then it would be as if there are futures contracts of all possible maturities, which off the top of my head should mean that it could track arbitrarily closely, depending only on the liquidity and risk tolerance of traders. 
As has been pointed out though, apparently redemptions aren't working at all at the moment, meaning the entire thing is fairly quiestionable, and certainly the arb would not be fully functionable now.

Now that it has gone up so far, I'm firmly into my rebalancing level. Meaning my holdings have gone up to the point at which I'm happy to take some profits and reduce them. So I secure some of the profit at this level, and reduce my risk from a pullback. If it goes up further, I continue to rebalance my position to a set fraction of my total assets, always taking profits. When it does turn around and correct or crash, I will buy the dip in order to maintain a different, lower fraction of assets. So I stay long, but adjust my position, selling high, buying low. If you believe bitcoin is going to be successful in the long run, you simply can't lose with this strategy. I've adjusted my levels down a bit because of the higher risk in bitcoin thanks to MMM, but everything else is exactly as I had planned since I mostly missed the train on the 2013 surge.

So wait a minute. We've decided that we want to place all the hope for a smooth high velocity economy on a payment system designed in the mid 20th century, controlled by a small number of people, resulting in a huge centralisation of trust and power, **and then we decide we want to legally force them to charge a fraction of the fee they request**!!! This sounds like a great idea.

The only fact it indicates is that the average (in some sense) price over a short time period is now higher than the same average over a longer time period. Everything else is guesswork and speculation which ought to be backtested rigorously before holding any kind of faith.
@_date: 2015-11-17 14:26:35
It is pretty serious if he said that, but can anyone convince me that this concept makes any sense? So in this speculative attack, a whale decides to dump large amounts of FRC (some currency) and what, buy bitcoin with them? Thus depressing the value of FRC. The central bank needs to offset this by selling bitcoin back in to the market. 
But hang on, wouldn't selling FRC for XBT simply raise the price of XBT in that market, leading to a move in the FRC/XBT rate relative to say the USD/XBT rate. However this leads to a change in the implied FRC/USD rate from these markets, leading to an arbitrage opportunity between these two markets and FRC/USD, thus the selling pressure migrates to the FRC/USD market, reducing the value of FRC relative to USD. As such the central bank can defend the attack by using their USD reserves, or in fact any foreign reserves, or gold etc. 
I'm sure it makes sense for central banks to hold their reserves in a broad set of currencies, but I don't see how bitcoin is completely necessary in this framework.

Meant to follow up on this.
Rebalancing is an established financial strategy for managing a diversified portfolio. It involves choosing allocation ratios between different assets and assigning the available capital according to these ratios. As time progresses the value of the investments in these assets will fluctuate such that they no longer adhere to the chosen ratios. At a chosen frequency the investments are adjusted such that the allocation ratios are restored.
I am dollar cost averaging into bitcoin. If/when it reaches a certain fraction of my net worth, I will begin a rebalancing strategy to maintain it at that fraction. I think that is the best strategy which involves no timing of the market (although the rebalancing frequency can be important, I think something like weekly/monthly should be a fine choice).

The easiest way to buy bitcoin is probably through [circle]( or [coinbase]( If you can get some by accepting it as payment from customers or friends all the better.
In the long run as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, the benefits of holding some bitcoin to use for many internet payments will become stronger.

These would be interesting numbers to see alongside hashing efficiency for evaluating miners, as I think you're right that this will be important in the future (although maybe this depends on the numbers, if heating efficiency isn't in fact possible then this may not be relevant).

You can see use as selling, just selling for something else rather than currency. Something that struck me the other day is, with the likely arrival of bubble after bubble after plateau after bubble etc., within a long term exponential trend, clearly at some point there will be a maximum. Eventually one of the bubbles will be followed by a correction which will not lead into a proceeding increase. Everyone should have their own prediction for where that point will be. It's an obvious point in one way, but it's definitely worth reiterating from an investment point of view.

that's true. the new entries into the mining scene are so efficient they don't need to worry about running costs, and so can just hold their coins. the people they are squeezing out were borderline profitable and so would have been selling all their coins. net result is fewer coins on the market for the moment.

Wrote some speculation on btc-e here:
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:53:37
A lot of people believe that this is a viable play in markets. Personally I think the idea that this kind of manipulation is viable in the long term is just wrong. In order for a market to be manipulable like this, I think there needs to be a lot of uncertainty about the underlying asset, a lot of capacity for fear that it will not be so valuable in the future for whatever reason. If a manipulator follows this strategy and the market later recovers, that shows that over time the confidence in the asset increased, and the need for fear was not so great. If the manipulator then tries to do this again, I think he'll find that the market won't be so easily scared. I would compare to the fable of the boy who cried wolf. You might say you can see this now with bitcoin, these days there are sometimes huge sell orders dragging the order book down on some exchanges, but there is little or no resulting capitulation in the market confidence. Slowly but surely the market recovers. 
tl;dr I don't think manipulating the market by causing crashes is a viable strategy in the long term.
edit: it would be a very interesting exercise to devote a few thousand to deploying a manipulative strategy like this on one of the cheap altcoins, and see if you follow a consistent strategy of buying and dumping can you keep profiting off the crashes. I think your luck will run out pretty soon. This might piss some people off, but hey it's a free market, and it would be really valuable information.

that's an interesting argument, but i would argue that the significance of the offer of person B is already computed by the market. let's say person B offered more than $12000 to the point that you begin to think it's worth taking the risk that he may not pay, because in the event that he does pay, you'll have earned enough to offset the risk. 
this is the calculation going on in the minds of btc sellers right now. what is the premium i need to earn over normal prices to make the gox risk worth it. as such these sales are valid, they just include different risk factors. a higher btc average price including gox just reflects the fact that many btc sellers are willing to risk their funds being locked up temporarily or indefinitely. it speaks to the value of the dollar, and to the value of immediacy which is not absolute.

If the price goes up, the profitability of miners goes up, so more people will enter mining and the network strength goes up. The network strength will always change gradually towards the point where mining profitability is moderate, like 10-50%. So because of the 10 fold climb in prices over the last 2 months, the network strength should respond in the same way. It takes some time, but it will happen. Bottom line: the network strength should be somewhere between 10-50 times its current level in a few months (uncertainty on profitability levels then, now and before).

I think the point is that through this mechanism you are entitled by contract to the value of those coins if and when you want it according to certain conditions, and if the trust fail to realise that value then they are legally responsible.

I agree there will need to be a consensus around this, and could help to increase the ease of adoption of bitcoin when it's resolved and adopted widely. It'll be interesting to see what gets adopted.
It's not all that important what the solution ends up being, but I'm not a huge fan of any of the current common suggestions. My issues with the current ideas stem from the fact that, given that satoshi has been widely adopted now as the current elementary unit that is 10^-8 BTC, it seems likely that at some point this will be the widely referenced denomination, assuming BTC continues its meteoric rise in the future.
This means:
1) At some point we will be working with 10^-8 BTC, meaning the terminology will have to get there in a number of steps. One step is too few, we're not ready to deal in satoshis, but 3 for example could be too many. Why not two? I think one ten-thousandth of a bitcoin would be a good denomination, currently worth around a penny. 
2) The conversion in terminology from bitcoin to satoshi is a big one. They're very different words with very different origins. Could we find something in the middle that bridges this gap somehow?
So I propose adopting the term *bittoshi* to represent 10^-4 BTC or one ten-thousandth of a bitcoin, or 10,000 satoshis.
Here's a table where I suggest also some symbols etc. for satoshis and bittoshis. I think it has a nice symmetry.
|quantity (bitcoins) | quantity (satoshis) | name | symbol | abbreviation |
|1|10^8| bitcoin | ฿ | BTC |
|10^-4|10^4| bittoshi | b (with the linethrough)| bTC |
|10^-8| 1| satoshi | 𝛃 (with the linethrough) | STC |

To clarify, I didn't mean that as a criticism of bitpay necessarily. I think they're entitled to publish raw stats. The lack of activity of many accounts does make the 10k figure less meaningful, but I still think that the 10-fold increase in a year is an impressive number, even assuming the fraction of null accounts has increased some. And no I don't imagine they'll want to publish activity stats, except maybe in such a way as to make them look busy. In any case, bitpay are the most important and promising company for bitcoin.

I'm not trying to argue the larger question of whether this is a good idea. I'm just trying to point out that there is at least one upside to these ideas. Nor am i trying to argue the point of whether governments are any good.
If you think about that practicalities of enforcing laws of posession and theft for bitcoin then you need two things.
a) you need a verifiable way of reporting to the authorities that you own a certain address. you need to be able to prove that the coins are yours, if you want them to come under protection.
b) you need a verifiable way of reporting the theft of those coins, that who ever controls them now took them illegally.
If you want these things then you're going to end up with a system that looks quite the coinvalidation idea, probably in the hands of the authorities.
So in order to enforce the laws, a database of coins is inevitable. Whether that makes it a net good idea is open for discussion, but there ought to be some balance to the discussion.

Ok, I understand the idea of signatures over passwords etc., what you have taught me is that keypairs generated using a simple hashing algorithm cannot be used with digital signatures. i.e. you cannot verify that you know the private key to a key pair generated using a simple hashing algorithm without actually divulging the private key.

BIPS is a European equivalent to bitpay, based in Denmark. Looks like they've been having some problems recently, so maybe not quite as reliable as bitpay at this point, but they aim to serve the same purpose. Bitpay will have no trouble sending money to Europe though (even outside the euro zone).

If you want to skip fixing bitcoin-qt (unless you're very interested in running a full node for whatever reason, i'd recommend skipping), find the wallet.dat file in the bitcoin directory, back it up to several places, and then you can import it somewhere else, e.g. this service by blockchain.info:

That mechanism is open, but hindered by the fact that SEPA withdrawals are now taking several weeks rather than days, and there is a small charge for SEPA withdrawals from gox.
10% is optimistic. Even yesterday when the divergence grew everywhere, the EUR divergence didn't stay at the 10% level long, and is now below 5%.
It stayed alot smaller than the USD divergence exactly because of the mechanism you describe.

As I understand it, if your fee is too low (except maybe in extreme cases) then your tx will be mined eventually, it just might be delayed. This somewhat negates the need to recall transactions, as if you're aiming for a 1st block confirmation, and you underestimate the fee required, it should not be off by so much, meaning it should end up in a reasonably close block which should not be disastrous. You can then re-evaluate your estimations for the next tx. I think this process should be roughly equivalent in time spent to your suggestion of repeatedly recalling transactions.

bitcoin.de is the most liquid pure euro exchange
no euros are stored on the exchange, trades are settled via direct bank transfer to the seller, the coins are held in escrow by the exchange until the trade is settled. it works very well, i've heard of no serious complaints. maybe not too scalable but a good system.
kraken is a more complete exchange, but they still lack reasonable volume. bitstamp has all of the above, but you have the complication of having your euros converted into USD. i don't know if you lose much in this conversion, but at least it's less straightforward.

Gavin, seeing as you're here, and on the subject:
To what extent will bitcoin be able to adapt if it comes under pressure from an altcoin with some superior feature? Say bitcoin propagation encounters some barrier that some altcoin is able to circumvent, how likely is it that bitcoin could just adapt by a protocol change, and so remove the advantage of the competition? If this is possible, then altcoins have no chance of becoming widespread, they will just be a bed of development innovation and experimentation for bitcoin.

For my part, I hope you're not planning to just omit the gox volume altogether! How could you justify that when they are still the dominant exchange? Despite the gox distortions, there is no way to estimate true value except a weighted average. If the distortions persist, buyers will go elsewhere and volume will spread around, reflecting in the average. 
To apply some reweighting to gox volume is a nice idea, but how do you arrive at the number? The only way to do this reasonably is to calculate some reweighting figure for each exchange based on the delays of transferring currency to and from the exchange. This would still be subjective, but could be fair if done right.
I would urge you to maintain the simple average as it is now in parallel with any revised figure with reweighting or without gox. You've made a great site, and are providing a vital service for the bitcoin economy, and if you continue doing so you'll be a crucial cornerstone in the growing ecosystem: think before you act!

Well fair enough, but I don't think everyone is trying to reference "the price of XBT in the USA" when they quote different prices, they are often quoting "the value of XBT" which is subjective but the closest you can get is a global number. To that point, you could say that the fact that gox quotes prices in USD is really silly, it should basically be a Yen exchange because that's the only currency which you can liquidate quickly. However, doesn't the fact that the majority of gox trades are quoted in USD mean that that is the currency of choice for most users? i.e. that was the deposit currency? Anyway, my point is the headline figure for the XBT value can only be a global average, according to which gox is not far off. If you're interested in local currency specific figures then that's different, but i don't think that's what most people are referring to. 
edit: also bitstamp is not really a USD price, it's more some kind of trans-atlantic aggregation. it's only quoted in USD because that is the global reserve currency, pretty much the same reason as MtGox, along with the fact that USD makes up a large fraction of deposits.

Dude the point is that dollar changes are not equally significant across this range of scales. Do you think the change from $100 to $300 is just as important as $49800-&gt;$50000? A $140 dollar change now would be big news, but if the price is about 50k then it could be a momentary fluctuation. Percentage changes are the sensible way to look at this process. Your way of expressing it is not technically wrong, it's just silly.
And your point that it will not be a uniform process is entirely right. The growth curve has been extremely noisy over the last two years, but it is best modeled by an exponential growth, not a linear one.

yeah it seems you're right, a block with a fee of 8x times the expected block reward should be competed over by anyone with more than 10% of the hashrate, before it has had another block solved on top of it. After the first subsequent block it would only make sense to try to repeat the large block with over 30% of the hashrate, and after the second further block you need about 45%, getting close to the usual 51% requirement for cheating. So if you're going to do it, do it fast.

The blockchain is a database of transactions. Those transactions are between bitcoin addresses. To retain control over (and therefore own) bitcoins, all you need to be able to do is prove that you have control over the address which contains your bitcoins, and that only means storing the private key. When you then want to spend those coins, you generate a transaction using that key with a client, and broadcast it to the network. The network contains numerous computers which store the database of transactions, and so they can check that the address that you have proven you control contains sufficient coins for the transaction. They do this by checking all the previous transactions and adding up all the coins which were sent to your address. If your transaction is valid, then it becomes accepted and your coins are sent somewhere else. 
The database, or blockchain contains all the information about the whole bitcoin economy. It is this that grows steadily over time through the miners. To control only one address you only need a tiny fraction of that information (in fact the private keys are not even in the database). To store bitcoins you do not need the blockchain, that is only to check the balance of your account, but you can let somebody else (i.e. the miners) do that for you. How else do you think people store bitcoins on their mobile phones?
As you research bitcoin more and more you'll realise that i'm right.

I think you're still missing my point. Imagine gox quoted their prices in Yen, which would be more reflective of their status as an exchange. How would you feel about me using the gox price to stand for a representative global estimate of the value of XBT? And would it not then be ok if I quoted this price in USD simply because it's the most widely recognised currency? You might say "Yes that would be unreasonable because this doesn't reflect the USD XBT value because delays etc." to which I would say, well we're not necessarily discussing the value of XBT to anyone in the USA, we're talking about any global citizen, simply quoted in USD for the sake of recognisability. When you talk about any global commodity in terms of any national currency you always have to assume some sort of perfect international fx liquidity, what else are we supposed to do?

Thanks, I'm actually not interested in mining myself, I'm just curious about the state of the network.

I'm interested in when that phase sets in again. 
I'm in Switzerland, power would be way too expensive, and the time and capital investment is also way too big now, not to mention the noise/heat.

True, to a beginner I might say faith in the bitcoin network, which at least broadly is more easily understandable, and leads to the question of what the bitcoin network does, to which I would answer "the network stores and maintains the public ledger of transactions, and validates and adds new transactions as they are conducted. the ledger is called the blockchain."

A long time ago, people first noticed a yellowy metal lying in streams, and bedded in rock at or just below the surface. The first people to start collecting this metal obtained significant amounts easily. As more and more people began to value this metal, those early adopters did very well out of their initiative. This is the story of gold, and is perfectly analogous to bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 09:26:23
It doesn't in and of itself, but the incentive for businesses to accept bitcoin is proportional to the wealth they store, so after this price level is sustained for some period we will see another wave of businesses adopting it. That leads to added value to the currency because it has more uses, leading to increased prices, and the feedback cycle of growth continues.
It will only halt when the market for uses of bitcoin is saturated, and we reach the limit of the amount of wealth that people are willing to store on the internet. Those limits are still orders of magnitude away.

You're probably right, but I think once we stay in equillibrium for a decent period smaller operations will remain probably at a small loss, with interests beyond profit, for the health of the network. The more adiabatic is the growth of the network, the more this will be a feature I think.
Anyway, I'm more interested in when that equilibrium is reached, rather than the nature of the mining operations.

That would work, or alternatively a smart phone, but two devices is not much of an improvement, and the investment requirement for a smartphone/watch is pretty high while they're totally over engineered for the problem.

I think that violence is a very sad, possibly the saddest, fact of our life. The threat of violence comes from many places, individuals, militias, governments. Places where governments have established a virtual monopoly on violence, are generally better places to be that where they have not (Somalia, Yemen, currently Syria and Egypt). You can look at it as governments being given a mandate by the people to wield a monopoly on violence on their behalf, in exchange for accountability. This idea is never perfectly realised, and as the violence is administered by humans, mistakes and corruption exist, but in some places they are kept in check by society. In that sense, violence over taxes is just an extension of that mandate. That is how I see it. I know this relationship between government ad society encounters a lot of problems, and is becoming more difficult to have faith in, but I still believe it exists.

[this]( is a useful link, which clarifies the position of 28nm (110~130,28~32,20~22), suggesting that if we're going to continue the terminology sensibly, the next level is 20nm. if 20 is 2012 technology i think it's likely that the investment costs may still be prohibitive enough to lead to a delay in asics being produced at this scale, and the same may be true for 14nm for some time.

Ok I know I'm inviting a firestorm here, but screw it. 
I can see that this idea of black/white listing coins is dangerous and scary, and it could be very bad news for the propagation of bitcoin and the benefits it is intended to deliver. 
However, does anyone see any positive consequences of this idea? A lot of coins have been stolen in the lifetime of bitcoin, leaving a lot of people out of pocket. This is likely to continue, though hopefully at a reduced rate as people get wiser about security and who they trust. However, it will still happen at some rate, and it would be nice if there were increased deterrents for people to steal coins, and the possibility of punishing those who do. Pretty much any way you try to tackle this problem you end up with a system with at least some features of what these coinvalidation people are proposing. In that sense this concept does have some upsides, that would be a positive for the community and the economy.
I'm not saying it's a net good idea. I'm just pointing out that there is at least one pro to this idea, you are all pointing out the cons very well. 
Please don't attack me for pointing this out, I'm here for sensible discussion. I'd just like it to be more balanced, rather than us all just running around with pitchforks.
@_date: 2013-11-06 15:40:33
right. sure big orders will dominate and affect the book, i don't really like words with negative connations though, sounds like the order is somehow malicious. even if the trader has selfish intentions, if they don't want the order filled they are risking a loss having the order on the books, so manipulation like that shouldn't be profitable.
if anyone knows any source on modelling order book dynamics i'd be really interested.

As I see it taxes are the only reason that fiat currency has value. Without that the government can print all it wants but no one will care, because people will use another currency. With taxes in place you allow a functioning economy while maintaining a mechanism whereby participants in the economy cooperate to contribute a representative amount to the functioning infrastructure of society. My perspective.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:37:42


disagree. i think people grossly overestimate the degree to which bitcoin is correlated with events in the real world that are not specifically related to bitcoin. i think the value is being totally determined by the perception of bitcoin itself and its viability. i don't think this will change for some time yet.

If you assume that the growth will look linear on a logarithmic chart, then you are assuming that the quantity itself has a purely exponential behaviour. This is what has been observed over the lifetime of bitcoin, but clearly isn't sustainable in the long term. So to model that, you just need to alter the power in the exponent to reduce over time. Something like A/(B+t) which for small t is constant, but goes to zero for large t. This would give a price which looks exponential at early times, but this growth slows down and reaches a plateaux at some point. On a log chart it would look linear at early times, but stabilise at some value in the distant future. I think this is the most reasonable way to model bitcoin, the problem is that it's so early in the game that none of this slowing of the exponential growth has showed itself yet, so fitting these parameters would not be possible, you would be stuck with speculation. It might be interesting speculation though, and it might be possible to take some guidance from macro data on the global economy.

I don't worry about hoarding, because the scarcity it creates inflates the value, which in turn incentivises people to sell. I own 6 BTC, I plan to hoard, but I have a selling price. If it reaches that, I will sell. Everyone who hoards is obeying the same mechanism, and so sensible prices are ensured. There will come a point when the price is not expected to rise much further, at which point hoarding will not be an issue.

well if you find something, you might find quite a lot. i presume you would have used bitcoind/bitcoin-qt then, so look for wallet.dat in a folder called "Bitcoin" or "bitcoin" or ".bitcoin" or something. first thing to do, before checking how many coins you might have is backup that file, copy it to at least one independent device.

Although you have a point in a sense, that sales on gox are somehow distorted to the point that you could argue that they are not really BTC-&gt;USD sales, at the end of the day, they are.

actually, given that the abbreviation for any of these needs to be capitalised, I would revise the abbreviations for bittoshis and satoshis to BTS and STS respectively, although these are maybe a bit less intuitive in some sense.
@_date: 2013-07-26 14:27:52
apparently, to comply with standards, the "abbreviation" needs to begin with an X and XBC is taken, so we're moving towards XBT for bitcoin. XST would work for satoshis, can't think of an appropriate one for bittoshis.

I think a bittoshi would be a good name for 10000 satoshis or 0.0001 bitcoins. Halfway between the two, in both value and name. Simplifies the picture.

I don't think it will be feasible to mine from blocks lower down the chain, in order for your coins to be worth anything you'd have to catch up with the rest of the network.
I think the situation RA was describing is where miner A finds a block very soon after miner B solved the same block. If A solves another block on top of that one before the chain of miner B is extended, they will have the valid chain. I don't really think that this will be an issue given the incentives for everyone to mine off the top, assuming a large number of transactions.

Btcchina has the largest 30 day volume of any exchange, and is arguably the busiest XBT exchange.

you could be right, but I am reminded of really how little bitcoin has managed to encroach into the economy at large, how far there is to go, what potential bitcoin has, and what resistance, or scepticism people will have to adopt it fully. remember it took the internet at least 10 years to reach anything like maturity, and it's still growing rapidly.

I know how it works mate. Stealing does not imply violence, it is taking without permission, without the right.
You may not call it theft, but many people do. Thefts occur when people misplace trust in others. With other currencies, there are much more powerful ways of following up that money, and catching the perpetrator. There are many downsides to the regulation of money, but a lot of people would see this as a positive, and a property that bitcoin would also benefit from. Up to now people have often happily stolen coins because they are certain they will face no consequences.

I think as an ultrashort answer to that question, "No" is the only reasonable one.

The higher the amount of wealth that bitcoin stores, the more incentive for merchants to accept it as a form of payment, which strengthens the value of bitcoin as a currency.

thanks for misquoting me, I didn't say that.


Absolutely, so the most representative estimate of XBT value is a full global weighted average of all trades. The sooner we have a widely published reliable number the better. Beyond that people will quote any number they like for the purposes of ATH etc, but you can't help that.


You did miss my point. CNY + Gox make up ~75% of global trade, and so if any price is irrepresentative, it is the price on bitstamp and btce. To think otherwise is super dollar centric. However, as we said, in truth all prices are representative and relevant in their own right.
The centre of gravity of the bitcoin world now lies somewhere in china (using a mercator projection :P), people need to wake up to that.

600k is the commissions that were amassed over the life of SR. I read in one of the court documents I think that they could even trace this via his personal SR account. His SR user wallet was being credited with all the commission transactions. If that were the case they should be able to track those through the blockchain, and possibly identify a decent chunk of them that he's holding on to, depending on how obscure he made it. It's quite possible he didn't hide them that well, although I'm sure he will have good encryption and backups. In terms of how much he still has unspent, I would guess well north of 100k.

that's not what people mean when they refer to the satoshi wallet. has it right. 
although it's virtually certain that satoshi is in principle in control of a huge amount of coin, my guess at least 5-10% of all coins available. i think at this stage most people are pretty confident that these coins will never move, but if they ever did it would have a huge effect on the market. 
i actually think the best thing that satoshi could do for bitcoin would be to release these coins to the economy in a slow predictable manner like releasing 1 coin a day in a lottery system. not only would that remove the uncertainty created by having all those coins lying in one place, but it might actually stabilise the price ( or help to ) for a few years.

Indeed. I think they will be pretty slow to open the door to bitcoin though. To do so would be to dissolve their capital controls. They may open the door slightly, in a similar way to the withdrawal limits in place. I think in the long term it's likely that bitcoin will negate all capital controls, but that may be decades away. 
edit: the other question is how tightly the rules will be enforced, many rules in china are enforced very loosely, or unevenly. i guess people might be feeling that out for a couple of years though.

While your point probably has some truth in it, I think you overstate the legitimacy of bitpay merchants. I spent about 5 minutes filling out the bitpay form to create an account for my fictional personal business, and it was verified the next day. As long as you claim that your transaction volume will be low enough, they don't seem to care who you are. I would guess that a decent fraction of bitpay's 10k merchants are null accounts. Probably a lower fraction than coinbase's, but still I think that figure of 10,000 was overhyped. Not saying it's not significant, just has to be taken with a pinch of salt.
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:18:09

That structure seems to be near universal across exchanges, with variations in the number of coins on offer on the various exchanges at different times. The curve to the left side of the centre rises much more steeply because it becomes cheaper and cheaper for people to post bids at lower prices. I imagine if you transform the x-axis to a log-scale the two sides would look a lot more symmetric. So I don't think it's notable in terms of price information.

I'm not convinced of that. Leaving apart the effect that inflation of the monetary base has, it seems to me like it's easier to make money if you have money, regardless of the currency. I'm sure the distribution of coins is going to widen much more, possibly more so than with previous currencies, but I don't see it as solving the problem of escaping the poverty trap.
edit: also this idea that fractional reserve banking is impossible with bitcoin is just not true. it's less likely, as there's less incentive for people to store there wealth with someone else, when they can just store it personally, but i think people are beginning to realise that bitcoin banks will exist, and so fractional reserve will come as some part of that.

You have a point, but I would say that there is an important distinction between people quoting the USD price for XBT, and the value of XBT quoted in dollars because it's the most global currency. I live in Europe, and I would mostly quote the price in dollars, just because it's globally recognised, so for that purpose all prices are valid. I think a lot of people are interested in this global headline figure, rather than local ones, but they quote in USD because it's the reserve currency.

The most disastrous risk is that the protocol breaks and all the properties that make bitcoin worthwhile fall apart. That seems less likely by the day, but it's sensible to have some fear that this is still possible. 
Less disastrous risks on the software front are that it doesn't prove possible to alter the protocol to allow the bitcoin economy to scale up (some of these challenges will be faced in the next year or two). This wouldn't kill bitcoin, but it would mean that it never really reaches its potential as a global comprehensive currency. I'm confident that this risk will also be overcome, but it's not certain.

I don't know the details of BIPS' fee structure (I find their website quite unclear), but if they can't compete with bitpay so close to home, that is an embarassment.

Maybe he thought that the genesis block coins would be considered pre-mined, and so didn't want to allow himself to claim anything that wasn't available to the network, or be seen to do that. It seems likely that satoshi mined a huge amount of coins before others started mining, but from current evidence it seems he has no intention of spending them. My guess is that he's more motivated by promoting the network, and faith in the network is higher if the designer and initiator is absent and not profiting from it.

I agree it's clear that Kraken are pretty impressive in a number of ways, primarily the speed of transfers. However, we should probably bear a few things in mind:
a) They're dealing primarily in pure SEPA transfers in the eurozone, which are faster to begin with. This is a plus point for them, but it's not actually mtgox's or bitstamp's fault that they're not using pure SEPA.
b) it's much easier to have fast banking transfers when you have such low volume. let's see if they can keep it up as the volume increases.

It's reasonable to be concerned that the price could be crushed at any time by a whale deciding to cash out, and flood the market. My rebuttal would be, they can only each do that once, or a finite number of times until they lose the power to influence the market because they have sold all the coins. Each time a big holder cashes out, that reduces the probability of a further flooding of the market, removing some of the fear built in to bitcoin. In this way, there will be ups and downs, but each down just clears the way ahead for more ups.

First you need to send them some money. Go to the funding tab, from there to deposit, from there to Euro. There will be details of a bank account to which you can wire Euros, which will be credited to your account. You'll be able to send the money from your bank account using a SEPA transfer. Make sure to include the reference key that kraken give you in the deposit page in the details of your SEPA transfer. The transfer should take a day or two to go through. Then you'll be able to buy coins on the trade tab on kraken.

@_date: 2013-11-07 12:07:58
What I think everyone should make very sure to take away from this is that somewhere at the end of the wild and erratic surge in the adoption phase, in which we are just now at the beginning, there will be an extended plateau/slow growth phase. What I think this means is that somewhere in the future is an enormous bubble of enthusiasm and speculation that when it bursts will **not** be followed soon after by a further rise. This means that at some point large numbers of people will be putting large amounts of money into bitcoin, and it will not provide a return on value in the medium and possibly not even in the long term. What you have to ask yourself is, when is that bubble going to happen? Am I going to be one of those people? I don't think we'll see it this year or next, probably not even this decade, but sooner or later there will be a mega-bubble which might never recover.

Another reason I don't believe that this strategy is in general profitable in the long term is just from empirical evidence from the rest of the financial world. In all kinds of asset classes there are assets in which the distribution of ownership is very uneven. e.g. There are many stocks which are publicly traded but a large fraction of which are in the hands of a small number of people. If manipulative strategies like this were feasible, then as soon as one owner attains a critical mass of ownership in any asset, they will be able to maintain and grow their stake in that asset indefinitely. I just don't believe that that's true.

It's not directly, but I think it relates to your overall outlook on regulation.

I've come across this issue and it's really frustrating. I saw a rumour that someone was trying to solve this problem, or had done so, but I don't have a source.
My rpi seemed to run bitcoind ok, but pretty slowly, and then would just crash after a few hours, probably due to some memory issue that I'm not qualified to diagnose.
I had thought to run a slightly sub-full-node, by getting it initialised elsewhere, and then cronning the rpi to run bitcoind for an hour or two every morning, until the blockchain is updated. Obviously doesn't provide the same civic service, but allows me to stay up to date.

I think my point has evolved to the difference between quoting "the price of BTC in the USA" and "the value of BTC quoted in USD because it's the most global currency (quoted by people from all over the world as citizens of reddit and the internet)". Without saying it, I think a lot of people are interested in the latter, not the former. So what would be really relevant is a global average, which I'm pretty sure we'll have soon.

Get the china story straight. It effectively legalised bitcoin, but only as a trading asset. Exchanges are legal, which is good news. But banks will not be allowed to deal with it, and more importantly, it is not a legal form of payment. Legitimate businesses are effectively forbidden from accepting it. This was not totally clear from the ruling, but it is the interpretation of Bobby Lee of BTCChina (see reports on his interviews at the vegas conference), and so it is my interpretation. This puts a huge dampener on the medium term adoption prospects of bitcoin. By no means fatal news, but it was bad news.

Excellent jeff. Am I right in thinking that digital signatures could be used entirely independently of bitcoin?

Would this be independent of bitcoin only in the choice of algorithm? i.e. if I use SHA256 (or double or whatever) i.e. the algorithm that coincides with bitcoin, then my key pair can be considered a bitcoin address?

I would say this, but my answer is right. You can understand it this way: a *limit* order instructs the exchange that you wish to (in this case) sell at a minimum price $710. If there are buy orders above $710 the exchange will match your order with them, starting with the highest price, and continuing until the volume of your order is filled.

I have suggested twice to bitcoin average that their headline figure should not be the average for any given currency, but a global average over all exchanges quoted in currency of choice, or by default USD. This would take into account the large and persisting variation between exchanges in different currencies.

They seem open to the idea, but have been working on other things.

So when you say signing algorithm, are you referring to the keypair algorithm, or that used in the signature? Maybe your point is that they are connected: having keypairs capable of signatures requires a certain keypair algorithm which goes beyond hashing.

ok, thanks. that's one pro, are you saying the dev team are more active than for SchBch (they really need to give that app a name, it's like opening a bank and just calling it bank)?
it would still be great for someone with experience of both to do a thorough compare and contrast though.

I can understand why Tony would say this, but he can't actually believe that it's true. Even in the worst of circumstances, I would predict a floor of $10 for BTC, and even if those circumstances would persist long term, I could imagine it growing back to $100 in five years. I think what Tony really thinks is that there is a significant chance that bitcoin won't achieve the stupendous value it is capable of, and may never do so.

newer than some clearly, so you can just pick a string and there is a subreddit, or it gets spawned when you click or post there? or did it exist already?

Me too, I tried some arbing between gox and europe, and am now waiting on a grand from Japan. Fail.
My point is, at some point you have to admit that your personal evaluation of the value of XBT because of the price you can realise quickly, is not representative of the global valuation because the bulk of trade is happening under different conditions.

Until the trial is over that is. Not even sure that they could not use them as evidence after having sold them.
