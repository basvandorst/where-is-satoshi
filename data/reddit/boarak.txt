This guy is the bitquick shill  Not cool Jad... not cool! 
This is everything wrong with this scene now. Seriously the paxful guys are making friends with the other top guys like localbitcoins and trying to bring the scene together... and this guy is what? spending all night spamming threads with spam complaints from like 20 different accounts??
WTF!

You can basically double your bitcoins in a month selling bitcoins but it is alot of work and can be a bit frustrating.
I sell on Paxful and I am being eaten alive. I do mostly debit now for very small amts in USD and CAD. Buyers are almost all females and need alot of coaching. about half the trades they start they do not finish because they are not very tech savvy. MY margins are 100% which sounds like alot but considering it is very small amts I am lucky to move a full btc a day. But when I do I double my money and after a week I have usually made about 5-10 BTC in profit. I buy off Circle or Coinbase at 1% over market and sell for 100% over market.
Just remember it is ALOT of work helping those girls for such small amts so don't feel bad about doing 100%, some do alot more. I have been thinking of going full time doing this but would need to hire help. You gotta have a certain zen to muster the patience for these buyers as many do not read or bother following directions but I do have tons of repeats now who always come to me first so it makes things much easier. You still need to beware the odd scammer who creeps in but by and large the buyers on Paxful are all the same and it is easy to tell who's who.
Good luck. You can still make a good living off bitcoin, just need to know where to be and work hard.
also LBC is another good place but u need to only trade with regulars and suppliers, smaller margins but still a handy tool.
Another bonus of selling on paxful is the girls always send lil treats like this.  :/

sanswork is most likely the bitquick shill  
You can find him trolling all their threads. Prob spam brigaded paxful and admin reported them from a 10 different accounts trying to ban them. Ignore this buttcoin reject. he will keep obsessing over paxful until he goes insane, or finds a new target.

may have something to do with BitQuick guys spending all their time trolling reddit. They especially love to raid the threads of Localbitcoins and Paxful. They were hitting their threads with like 5-10 trolls.
example  
Why haven't they been banned yet, with trolls like that?
Last thing we need is no respect having tomfoolery like this. Plenty of other options including the above and others.
