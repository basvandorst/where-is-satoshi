Use the Coinbase app under settings -&gt; identity document

Sorry but that worked for me a couple months ago.

I just took my initial investment out after it doubled.  In hindsight I wish I left it in but that’s probably because of the price at the moment.

Did you write down the key that coinbase provides when you set up google Authenticator?

Nov 10th was a holiday so it’s only been 4 business days if the deposit was initiated Friday afternoon. Should be there Monday or Tuesday

Are you in the U.S.?

It seems a lot of the complaints about frozen accounts are from outside the U.S.  My only suggestion is to try to verify your identity again. Hope you get your funds back eventually.

But this is asking the majority to liquidate their investments so a minority can profit.  The transaction fees are just too high to spend $5 and go home and buy $5 more in bitcoin.

Thanks. I’ll use another method of verifying then.

If my math is correct you started with about .06 bitcoin. If you reinvested your initial investment after selling at 4,300 you would increase your share to .075  at 3,500.

This needs to be automatic somehow. Until then there will be too many HODLing

You will get an amount of the forked coin that is equal to your BTC amount. The value is unknown.

Didn’t they say they would support both after the fork?

Do it through the Coinbase app.
