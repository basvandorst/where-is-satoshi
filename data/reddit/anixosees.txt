"They may then pronounce all existing exchanges as suspect and confiscate all coins that enter their ecosystem originating from those sources."

That's helpful. So what's the truth?

My first transaction failed. I emailed support and they said I'd have to send my ID and copy of my power bill to vefiry my identity. Later, they said the issue was actually because I'm using an anonymous email (hushmail) and their system flagged it a suspicious. Long story short, I had to change my email address to Outlook, then the purchase completed, instantly. It a dumb policy though.

You'd still want the latest version of qt though.

Nice. A countdown time would be helpful though.

Apple pay doesn't address the unbanked. It doesn't address micropayments. It doesn't address global payments. 
Apple pay is just another centralized payment method, which means now merchants have to be compliant with both Visa/MC/AMEX AND Apple's terms and conditions. Enjoy the fees and legacy infrastructure.

Generally speaking, you're better off buying it then trying to mine it. That being said, if you just want to have fun mining, you could buy something like an Antminer S1 for under a hundred bucks. Check out buyahash.com, they even include some basic setup info. I have one and I won't need to heat my small basement this winter :-) Let me know if you want more details.

If it turns out bitcoin "needs" one of these new innovations, it can just incorporate it.

Click download zip. Each chapter is listed there individually. It's not like it's an epub or anything.

Start by backing up your wallet.dat file; if you're on Windows it's in %appdata%/bitcoin. 
Then download the latest bitcoin wallet and install. If you still have problems, delete everything in the bitcoin folder in appdata except the wallet.dat, then try to reopen. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 06:18:10
I think it's more accurate to say Bitcoin is pseudonymous.

How about mentioning bitcoin can be sent around the world for pennies. Also, places to get bitcoin: circle, coinbase, bittylicious, etc. More places to buy stuff, Dell, Overstock, Dish.

You will certainly shorten it's life. Video cards weren't really designed to run at 100% all of the time.

The same could have been said about the Internet. With the amount of capital flowing in, I'm very hopeful, but you never know.

It probably wouldn't hurt if retailers held bitcoin instead of instantly dumping it, causing downward pressure. 
@_date: 2014-11-08 02:51:46
I would think it would continue. If bitcoin makes it that long, it probably means there has been some level of mass adoption. I would guess that would mean it's worth a lot more too. Also, with the advances in the mining industry, asics are getting more hash for less watts and that will only continue. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:59:48
Asic speeds are measured in Ghs or Ths, so 300 Mhs sounds about right. You will lose money on electricity and mine next to nothing. If you just want to have some fun mining, check out an Antminer S1. You should be able to pick one up for under $100. Otherwise, just buy the bitcoin. If you're in the US, use either Coinbase.com or circle.com

Or else, boot from a Windows PE or Linux Distro cd (don't install), then search the drive for your wallet.dat

You can try your luck on eBay, but I bought one from buyahash.com for $90. I get about .01 btc every week.

A merchant who accepts PayPal can turn on Bitcoin as an accepted method of payment, but that's all for now.

I just setup greenaddress last night as a chromium app to use with my hw.1. No issues. So far I like the interface better than coinkite.

In the scenario above, make sure to back your wallet up too! You never want a single point of failure. 
An alterative to the offline Electrum wallet, would be a multi-sig wallet. BitPay has released one called Copay ( Multi-sig requires multiple authorizations before you can send bitcoin, thus it adds some security from theft. Multi-sig is just starting to get easier to use, so keep on the look out and at least read up on it.
Lastly, you can read this CoinTelegraph article.

No and I think it's a little b.s. I signed up for an invitation when they were still offering it, but they never invited me. When they opened to everyone, they said they weren't doing it anymore. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 13:50:45
There's also purse.io, but it's just for Amazon. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:45:06
Why? 
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:35:32
True, I suppose I should have clarified. I'm just annoyed that I signed up during the giveaway, but never received the $10 because I was technically never invited.

I had never heard of Wedg, which also looks cool. Reminds me a bit of ArkOS, but less DIY.

Just to play devil's advocate here, what is the point when the retailer's immediately still it to fiat?
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:10:45
Yeah, I wasn't trying to start a phone debate, just thought it was an interesting comparison.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:11:13
Not the most accurate description and the Bitcoin logo is upside down, but she says fuck a few times, so it's gotta be good.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:12:46
Obviously, there isn't a correspondence as they are completely different things. I thought it was interesting comparison. Perhaps trying to draw it all together with my final question was a stretch though, I'll give you that.
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:40:58
Nice, but does that mean you can still spend it though?
@_date: 2016-02-14 02:35:29
Totally. I wonder what props up fiat... oh yeah.
