Untouchable? I wish that was the case. There are a hundred ways to get at BTC and others by our governments. We're working on it, but this fight is far from finished.

Interesting. Thank you! Is this specifically for paying someone in bitcoin or for jobs in the field?

You bet. SB1241 is titled The "Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing, and Counterfeiting Act of 2017" but seeks to define any user of "digital currency"  "or any digital exchanger or tumbler of digital currency," as in violation of federal law. 
Furthermore, they want to be able to identify users and in section 13 require the Department of Homeland Security to have "a strategy to interdict and detect prepaid access devices, digital currencies, or other similar instruments"
Interdict means: intercept and prevent the movement of  
(I had to look it up when I read it the first time)
Section 2516(1)(c) of title 18, United States Code referenced in section 10 will also legalize the arrest and prosecution of individuals who help others buy bitcoin and other crypto currency by officially defining them as "illegal money services businesses"
Hope this helps!

I don't hate coinbase. I hate the people who think its a good idea to let government have a hand in one of the most innovative industries in the last 200 years. We need to get rid of crap like SB1241 removing privacy and keep Uncle Sam from getting his grubby fingers in our digital wallets.
Now there are people who are working on this by leaving the fiat system entirely, but I still believe this is possible to fight from within. Thats why I founded the Better Money PAC, to do exactly that. Elect pro crypto candidates across the country and stop them from messing with a good thing.

Get Uncle Sam's dirty hands out of my digital wallet. Between this and SB1241 we are running a dangerous line already. I didnt think we would get here until mid next year, but these uneducated regulators are already going out of control. We need Better Leadership if we want to keep Better Money.
