Correct! Great point of view..

Germany is crypto tax haven as well. There’s no (zero) capital gains taxes on crypto if you hold it for more than 1 year. So if you invest your life saving and hodl throughout the next bull market you can turn those 100x gains into Euros without even handing over as much as a penny to the tax authorities.

Ignorant who knows jack shot like most other people... “I don’t believe in crypto currencies but in Blockchain”. This only tells me one thing. They are opening their shitty mouths about something they don’t know shit about. Had they had just the slightest knowledge about this subject they would all know that crypto currencies represents the incentive structure needed to run a blockchain in a decentralized fashion. Crypto and blockchain go hand in. When public people that are thought to be living oracles unknowingly display they obvious stupidity it  just makes me realize why I’m in crypto and why this is still early enough to be very profitable.

Awesome! Grey is an excellent pick ��

This could be the current state of crypto meaning that we should just lean back and enjoy the ride and stop being scared bc the crypto revolution is coming. Hodl for wife!

Nice! As a gift for my best buddy for his birthday I also bought a 30 minute co-driver gift card for a super car (911 GT3 RS). Great fun!

So Satoshi fucked up and lost his private keys, hence not able to prove his identity... How inconvenient...
@_date: 2019-06-10 03:41:29
That is a 100% yes! Just hold 1 Bitcoin and you’ll be fine. All the millionaires in the world won’t be able to acquire one Bitcoin each due to the 21m cap, that itself is reason enough ��
