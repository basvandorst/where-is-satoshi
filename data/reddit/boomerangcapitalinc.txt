BTC 1D chart: Price spiked up earlier today and was rejected by range high resistance, looks like it wants to close below the recent swing high here as well.
Bearish sign for sure. If the EQ fails then expect a move to the downside and sub $9k.
Since the recent move out of the range was from the highs, we can expect the next one to be the lows, as that is where the biggest draw on liquidity is for now.
BTC PA still looks atrocious... typically occurs at crossroad points when liquidity has dried up on both points and bulls/bears aren't confident in entering positions...

Hang tight on bullish expectations this week until we can get a convincing close above $10.6k Right now the bounce is not the strongest and seems like a dead cat bounce, which leads to further downside. 
The weekly close was decent and printed a higher low with a strong rejection wick. Indecisive price action for now, waiting for more information before taking trade-worthy stances.

Anticipated breakdown finally happening for BTC. 
As spoken about in our previous updates, (Can check my profile posts) BTC found liquidity to the downside, resulting in a near 5% fall in price today. 
Things look even more likely to move towards sub 9k at this point. 
This is nothing to fear, but definitely something to anticipate as this will be a large dip to buy. 
However, there is also still a chance we find support before then so be careful around these lower prices. Long term, this is a great spot to start scaling in.
@_date: 2019-08-18 06:50:22
Bitcoin. The range EQ support has held at $10.1k as we see price bouncing up towards the range high. 
It seems likely that we test the range high as their looks to be a good amount of equal highs up above which would make for a perfect liquidity pool before a move lower. 
Keep your expectations low in the event of a move up, unless we can close above $10.6k on a high time frame basis.
@_date: 2019-08-21 01:33:43
BTC finding resistance at range high.  
The big picture resistance now is at $11k. This lines up with a pivotal level as well as the range high. 
10k is now the level to hold as support for it is a strong psychological level of support as well as the range EQ. 
Temporary downtrend looks to be in the making for now. The resistance at the range high and $11k level seems to be holding for now. A break down below $10k looks like we will make a move down below $9k.

Support holding on, no sign of strength coming in yet. 
Price is still just hanging on at support here. No sign of a high volume bounce yet though so that is a concern. 
We look like we may be finally headed for a sub $9k BTC as we have expected for quite some time now. 
Should price make its way back up to the $9.7k area we could see a great short opportunity before the move down.
@_date: 2019-08-17 22:32:08
BTC. Expecting we pop above $10.6k for a hunt at liquidity then get rejected back down from there
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:50:19
Bakkt has been approved to launch its physically settled futures on September 23. 
“Physically settled” futures means that, instead of settling by cash (where nobody actually trades any bitcoin) Bakkt will actually be buying bitcoin in the open markets, taking bitcoin out of the market, and custodying bitcoin.
That’s never happened before. And never on the scale of a company such as Bakkt, which has the same owner as the New York Stock Exchange.
@_date: 2019-08-15 03:01:26
I’m speculating here, but it seems retail buyers have heard and seen these predictions of a retrace back to 8k-9k for awhile now, so they don’t wanna step in now. And big money wants to get price down to an entry they want.  Along with the global financial news uncertainty seems to be the perfect storm for buyers sitting out and not stepping in here. Could be wrong, but that feels right.
@_date: 2019-08-15 02:20:45
The all important 5-figure mark and horizontal price action level at 10k is the next level BTC needs to hold for a hope at bullish momentum

Solid stuff from BTC today as it made its way above the resistance and shot up to the range high just below $11k. 
The big move for bulls is now a break above $11k. 
Should that occur it seems like there is a good chance we can get a move on back towards new highs. 
Watch for dip buying opportunities back at $10k

After the nuke of constant selling yesterday price has finally found some relief. A dead cat bounce at this point seems to the most likely scenario that plays out, meaning we see a bounce but a short lived one before heading to sub $9k. A break below $9k opens up a fantastic level for longer term buys.

Whether people use cryptocurrencies to pay for products and services or strictly for investment purposes, they may not be aware that they have a possible taxable impact.  
If a taxpayer purchases a virtual currency and uses it to purchase something (trades the cryptocurrency for a good or service), the IRS requires him to calculate a capital gain or loss on each transaction. Capital gains on personal-use property are reportable and subject to tax.

Just looking at the short-term charts. Seven thousand, five hundred dollars is still in play. And just in terms of the technicals on the charts, we still might see $7,500.
If we do see $7,500 on bitcoin, I don’t want you to panic about it. The chart suggests that we were going to see $7,500. Maybe $7,800 is the low, but I want you to know there is a possibility we might go to $7,500.

Today has been an absolutely lethargic day for BTC as price fails to move in either direction.
Bottom line remains the same, a break above $11k, especially on a high time frame basis (1D or &gt;) is a large sign of strength for bulls.
Waiting for this to happen is the highest probability move in terms of looking for longs
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:40:59
$10760 has been a pivotal level on the weekly chart  due to the higher time frame monthly significance. Last week closed as a bullish SFP after sweeping the low, we are now seeing the bullish move following said sweep.

BTC movement finally today, price making a move to the upside. 
After historical volatility reaching lows not seen since May 1st, we finally saw a bit of movement today with price reaching up and above resistance at $9.7k. 
This level needs to flip as support and push price above $10k next for the rally to sustain. 
We are not yet convinced of a full on reversal until price can break the psychological barrier of $10,000 and hold above it again. 
Until then, do not be surprised if BTC sweeps the near equal lows at $9k.
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:43:48
Bitcoin. After slamming down into support and through multiple swing lows, price immediately bounced and recovered upwards with great force.
This is a sign that bulls are now in control after the bearish attempt failing, resulting in a bear trap.
Those who sold and were stopped out at the swing lows will now act as fuel on the way up.
Expect further bullish price action to follow over the next week or so. The first plan of action will be to break above $10450-10.5k.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:17:48
1D chart: the daily is showing price remains range bounce. We are seeing bullish reactions at range low, designated by the wicks being printed on the daily chart from the demand zones. The current draw on liquidity looks to be up around $10.5k, especially if price can close above $9850 on the daily chart today.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:48:34
Bitcoin price continues to sink and drag lower after posting lower highs in this consolidation pattern. 
That said, we are now back at a larger time frame support and this level has proven strong when tested previously. 
It seems unlikely that the top of a bull run would end in a consolidation pattern that drags out for nearly three months. 
If there is a move down we believe it will be very short lived and one for buying. For now, 9.5k needs to hold.
@_date: 2019-09-16 03:21:20
Bitcoin. 10.3k is now the interim level of support for price during this miniature consolidation period
The major resistance now lies at $10.5k.
The weekly candle closed inside the previous weekly candle, signaling indecision and consolidation.
More noteworthy is the daily candle close which resulted in the 3rd inside bar daily candle, showing how tight the current range is on price action.
This upcoming week should bring fireworks. Bullish objective remains breaking above $11k.
@_date: 2019-09-05 21:04:10
BTC. Signs of potential move sth incoming, local high being swept.
10.4k collapses and we might head back down to the $9ks. This is reminding us a lot of the post 2018 top situation with lower highs across the board.
Eventually the bouncing ball runs out of steam. For now it is ok but if we trade below 10.4k that'll be quite the concern.
@_date: 2019-09-30 03:09:17

Indecisive action today with price as we saw the lower time frame lows get swept, followed by a daily small bodied doji, the epitome of a standstill.
The monthly closed within the range of the previous monthly, also showing signs of further consolidation.
This is similar to the price action in 2016 which we saw after the big breakout. If it continues to follow the fractal we should keep consolidating for the new several weeks followed by a vicious run up for the next year or two.
Stay the course, be patient, and keep stacking sats.
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:45:52
BTC. Ok so the monthly resistance and daily resistance both line up around 10.8k. This will be absolutely crucial to break above.
If we see a convincing break above this level, look to buy the dip with eyes on new yearly highs.
The next level of resistance will be the pivotal level and this will decide the fate of the next few months for BTC.
Should BTC begin trading and trending up above 11k, we can expect new highs, but that level has to hold.
Until then, stay patient and wait for a breakout/reversal.
DM for chart.
@_date: 2019-09-22 00:39:18
Bitcoin. Price has done nothing but retrace after the pump up that occurred previously in the week.
Price also broke below the range of the larger candle which price closed between over the past previous 8 days. This is a bad sign for bullish continuation.
The larger macro consolidation pattern remains in tact
@_date: 2019-09-03 02:25:51
Blistering move up today as bulls completely retrace the dump from last week. This now sets price up for a reversal but only if we see 10k hold.
Bad news is, price has been rejected in the past by the resistance at 10.5k, and it looks to be having troubles here once again.
The past few months has been nothing but consolidation and chop, making it very tricky conditions for traders.
Try not to get frustrated if you are day trading these conditions and pick your setups wisely.
When things start trending again, moving with the tide will make for a much easier time. Patience pays.
@_date: 2019-09-23 02:03:47
After the launch of the Bakkt monthly futures market the Bitcoin price still remains in a low volatility state. The apex of what many would dub a symmetrical triangle classical chart pattern is nearing an end and should resolve in the next week or two. The move away from this consolidation pattern is likely to be violent.
Unfortunately it is difficult to predict the direction of these patterns due to their symmetry, yet, we can keep a bullish bias due to the trend before it and the similar situation that occurred after the bear market in 2015.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:45:06
Bitcoin. Under the previous swing lows that built up over the past 3 months laid loads of stop losses that were set by those in longs, limit orders set by breakout traders who wanted to sell the breakdown, as well as liquidation prices for those in underwater longs.
These all combine to massive selling and result in what we saw today, a very strong bearish decline in price in a short period of time.
A break below $7.5k would be a true concern, but for now this is a normal and very great opportunity providing dip in a bullish market.
The time to start buying in slowly, in anticipation of a continued bull market as we approach the next halving, is now.
@_date: 2019-09-13 21:48:23
