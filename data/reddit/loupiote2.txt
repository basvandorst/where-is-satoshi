Except that if every American was using Bitcoin instead of dollar, the whole BTC network would grind to a halt. But we can assume that other cryptos some day will be able to scale orders of magnitude better and allow hundreds of thousands of transactions-per-second with no fees and almost instant confirmations.

try bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:32:35
it is very easy to sell the BCH.  just move all your BTC to another (preferably cold) wallet (that uses a different seed!!!), then (e.g. using electron cash on windows), move your BCH to Bittrex, and sell them for BTC.  it takes 5 min, and it is completely safe, since your BTC have been already moved to another wallet first.... so even if your private keys are compromised when you transfer your BCH, it won't be any risk to your BTC.
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:40:03
you can use the blockchain explorer to check if your wallet still have the BTC.  just enter your  PUBLIC key in 
It will tell you your balance.
No need to transfer them anywhere else, as long as your private key is secured and safe, you won't lose your BTC.  make sure to have multiple paper copies of your private key, and not in the same house!!! i(in case your house burns down)

I bet there are a bunch of nodes and miners that have already installed the software that will implement the 2X fork :)
.... since the software was made available before the fork cancellation.... and this software will only trigger the new rules after the fork block. Isn't it the way it works?
hopefully no coin or tx will be lost because of this!

you can still buy some BCH so that you will own an equal amount of both coins.
It will hedge you from further losses, but you won't immediately recover what you have already lost.  You will probably recover in the long run.
If you stay on one single side on the fork, regardless of which side, you are taking more changes, both on the up and down sides.

Your bitcoins are not stored on your hardware wallet.  They are "stored" (in the form of unspent Tx) on the public blockchain, replicated on many nodes on the internet.
Your wallet only contains your private keys, which allows you to spend your bitcoins. As long as you have a backup of your keys (or the words seeds used to generate them), you will always be able to re-create a wallet on another device or computer, and spend your bitcoins.

Coinmotion seems to be a legit exchange from Finland.
There is no guarantee that the value of the Bitcoin you buy will go up, but many people who understand how it works trust this technology and are convinced that in the long run, the Bitcoin value will increase, and maybe double or tripple by the end of next year, or even more.  But it may also drop by 50% or more if an exchange goes bankrupt or get hacked, or if some regulation goes against the use of crypto, or for no other reason than people losing confidence in this technology.

not "the same amount of money", but rather the same number of coins, that's very different.
it is very possible that the value of 1 BTC coin + 1 S2X coin after the fork will be less than 1 BTC before the fork.  nobody knows.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:30:31
it's the number of unconfirmed transactions, not yet included in a mined BTC block. In normal times, it should oscillate around 25k.  
Because of backlogs, Tx fee are going up, since miners have a financial incentive to prioritize picking Tx that have higher fees, to put them in the next block that they mine.

you will be able to "sweep" your BTG into a Coinomi wallet, once Coinomi wallet supports the BTG network (which should be very soon).
You will need to enter your private key into Coinomi, so make sure to remove all your other (BTC) coins from this address before sweeping it, for safety reasons.
I found this with google and some research...

that's because BTC changes value.
My used motorbike did not change in value during the last 2 months.  It still have the same mileage, and it is still in the same conditions. Its value has not decreased by a factor of 2.  It's BTC value that has increased.

well, since Tether.io does not actually exchange USDT for USD (and no other exchange does that either), i am surprised that people still put their money there (i.e. they sell Cryptos for USDT on exchanges).
I am assuming that exchanges do transfer hard cash (USD) to Tether.io in order to buy USDT, right?
So right now, Tether.io only sells USDT, they never buy them back, right?
This really looks like a bad scheme to me.  This will implode some day, for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:53:42

Why is BTC vulnerable to this type of Tx spam attacks (if that's what it is)?

looks like there are lots of unconfirmed transactions in the mempool right now.
maybe because a lot of miners left the BTC chain to mine the BCH chain, that is more profitable for them right now.  Hopefully the difficulty adjustment will happen at some point, but unfortunately it won't happen before several weeks, I think.

Your BTC are not in your wallet. your wallet only contains your private keys. Your BTC are stored in the public blockchain ledger, in the form of signed transactions.
You can just install your private keys in another wallet, doing this won't require any transactions or any fee, it will just give you access to your BTC from another wallet.
Remember, no wallet ever contain any BTC, they just contain your private keys.

or you could use another wallet app and restore your wallet from your seed.

since your coins were on an exchange, you did not have access to your private keys. They were in a vault at coinbase :)
in order to have access to your private keys, you need to have your coin "in" a wallet that you fully control. E.g. a cold wallet.
yes, you will have access to your BCH on Coinbase in january.

no, there are at least 2 standards being used to generate the wallet private keys from the multi-word seed, and they are not compatible:
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:59:21
I think the issue is that there is a major backlog on the BTC mempool right now, and many people have unconfirmed transactions, if you look at  .
So the only way is to be patient and wait, or use RBF with much higher fees, or get more mining hashpower on the BTC chain.

Of course, the value of fiat currency changes, too, but in general, it is quite stable and devaluates by only a few percent per year (i.e. inflation). Gold value is pretty stable too, so are diamond, and many other commodities. Petrol not so much, because its value fluctuates with geopolitical issues. So barrels of crude oils would not be a great currency, not to mention it's a bit unpractical!

yes, but because those are futures, not coins, and even two different versions of the future, they cannot be moved between exchanges.  so arbitrage is not possible! unless you want to pair some BT2 with BT1 that you already have on bitfinex (to get BTC back before the fork block), there does not seem to be any good reason to buy worthless 2X futures.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:51:10

i don't think this statement is correct. why would it be the case?
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:53:56
I know it would not be a big deal if some nodes or miners accidentally forgot to remove the 2X software version. It would be unlikely that a rogue 2X block would be mined, and even if it happened, it would not be validated, since most nodes would reject it. Hopefully!
BTC.com, BitFury and BTCC are still signaling 2X in the blocks they just mined. I know "signaling means nothing", but...
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:34:17
Bitcoin Gold, yes, but you can access them only if you control your private key. If you use an exchange, it all depends if the exchange will support BTG.

Remember that wallets do not contain your funds / coins.  They only store your private keys (i.e. the keys allowing to send out the coins to other addresses). Your coins are not stored anywhere since they do not really exist! (crypto currencies are virtual currency, remember?). But the number of coins on your addresses appear in the public blockchain ledger.
as long as you have a way to restore those keys on another wallet, you can always access your funds.  Usually, wallets use Hierarchical Deterministic standards, where all the private keys can be generated from a seed (which you should carefully backup) - usually a set of words.

what you are describing is called a STOP-LIMIT order.  i.e. it is a LIMIT sell order that will be placed if a transaction happens under the STOP value that you indicate.
The problem with stop orders is that you may lose a lot in case of a flash-crash with immediate recovery at a much higher value above your sell order.

Right, but will it keep working as well, if there are 10 times more users using Bitcoin, and if they start using it 10 times more often?

You don't understand the difference between "value" and "value in fiat".  both are different. you don't need fiat to give value to things.  e.g. the value of a used car is certainly less than the value of a nice house, and you can say that without having to think in fiat terms.

the only thing i had to do manually was to deal with the Bitcoin Cash "airdrop", since they must be declared as "other revenue", and, according to well informed crypto tax articles in Forbes etc, they can't be seen as dividends not as Capital Gain (from a $0 initial value).  They must be declared as revenue, and entered manually in bitcoin.tax as being acquired on the day of the fork, for the value they had on the day of the fork.
for the rest, this service was able to reconcile many transactions on several exchanges, and calculate the FIFO capital gain (which is the rule that should be used according to the IRS, for cryptos).

I don't think Bittrex is a minor exchange, yet they do use USDT.
You said only a few exchanges (Bitfinex and a handful of more minor ones) use/support USDY, so i don't agree with what i read from you.

You will have access to it in january 2018, based on an announcement from coinbase.
If you had control of your own private keys, e.g. if your BTC were in a cold wallet, you had access to your BCH immediately after the fork, but splitting the coins were your responsibility, and it was a somehow risky and delicate operation to do.
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:21:37
So when a market correction causes Tether to implode, people holding USDT will lose everything, and people holding Crypto will see their value plunge (due to panic selling attempts to non-trading USDT / lengthy transfers to exchanges that actually have real fial like dollars or euro).
but if they hold to them during the panic, their Cryptos should hopefully bounce back some day.... is that a possible scenario?

There is a little problem, though.
For example, I was selling a used motorcycle for 1.2 BTC a couple of months ago.
Shortly after, I had to change the price to 1 BTC, then 0.8, then 0.7, then 0.5 BTC.
It is not practical to do commerce with a currency that changes in value very fast (whether inflationary or deflationary).

there is a CRC code in BTC addresses, so if you just make a typo, chances are the address you enter will be invalid, therefore the transaction will be rejected by the BTC network.
Did you check if the transaction went through in the blockchain? (e.g. by doing a search with blockchain.info )
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:25:21


Sure, but if the fist currency value was changing by a factor of 2, you would change the price of whatever you sell, because the price of the things you buy would have changed.  This happens in countries where inflation is such that fiat currency looses big percentage of its value every day.
I was in Brazil once during a high inflation period, and even the bus fares was changing every day. So shops were not putting tags with prices, they would write the price of things with chalk on tablet, and erase / rewrite a higher price every morning...
It's the same with BTC, really...

only this part applies:
For BTG, since you didn't have BTC in Coinomi at the time of the snapshot, you need to do the following, (only after we enable the wallet and the coin actually launches):
1. Create a BTG wallet in Coinomi, WITHOUT altering the derivation path (our instructions in the link above were for people who had BTC in Coinomi at the time of the snapshot).
2. Get the private key of the BTC address that contained the BTC at the time of the fork. Consult your wallet provider's FAQs on how to do this if you have trouble doing so. Consulting our article for the (near similar) situation of the Bitcoin Cash fork, might help you get your private keys from your wallet provider: 
3. From your new BTG Coinomi wallet's Overview page, click on .../Sweep Wallet, and enter the private key you got at step 2.

Money is flowing back and forth between the two sides of the fork (BTC and BCH = Bitcoin cash).
If you look at the value of 1 BTC + 1 BCH, it is about unchanged and still around $7300.
So if you had BTC before the fork, you own an equal amount of BCH, and your total net worth is about unchanged.

If you keep the same amount of BTC and BCH (which is the case unless you sold the BCH that you obtained on the fork date), then there is no worry at all:
If you look at the value of 1 BTC + 1 BCH, it is about unchanged and still around $7300.
It's all politics and big business that causes the money to flow back and forth.
Eventually wither BCH will stabilise at some percentage level of BTC (e.g. 25%), or it will go down and completely die - which is unlikely IMHO.
But your net worth will remain unchanged, or it will actually grow, if this whole mess does not destroy the confidence in Bitcoin - and in Cryptos in general.
If you try to play the market (swings / pump / dump) between BTC and BCH, chances that you will in fact loose some money, unless you are a very skilled trader.

deflation usually means that the total number of currency units decreases, with about the same total market cap, so the value of the currency increases, causing prices to go down.
But in case of Bitcoin, the number of currency units increases, so if should be inflation occurring, but the market cap increases even faster, due to speculation, so the value of the currency increases, causing prices in the currency (BTC) to go down.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:32:56
i disagree with that view.
people gave value to things before using money, and there are still indigenous communities that use barter instead of currency, and they give value to things, while they have no price.
e.g. they give move value to a house than to a canoe, more value to a canoe than to a chicken, more value to a chicken than to a fish, and more value to a fish than to an egg etc. but they never use price.
value has to do with how much efforts it takes to build or catch something, and how useful it is (as food, shelter, tool, etc).
Something easy to produce, to build or to catch in nature will usually have less value (an egg has little value, because it's easy to get some - if you have a chicken, you will get many eggs!, but a chicken has more value). Something harder to produce will have more value if it is useful.  If it is not useful, then the thing has less value, even if rare or hard to produce.

Maybe, but only if there is a layer above the Bitcoin protocol that allows for very low tx fees (e.g. around 2% on small transactions between $1 and $100 equiv), and fast tx verification (e.g. e few seconds, like with credit-cards, paypal etc).
Right now, average tx fee is about $1 to $2 and tx verification takes 6min to 1h. Not practical for everyday use at the grocery store or at the gas pump.
I read that the Lightning network layer could reduce dramatically the tx fee and delays so then it would trigger more mass adoption, once they have secured wallets on cell phones.

I don't forget that. Clearly Bitcoin is good as a store of value, like gold.  But that's not my point.  My point is about using Bitcoin as a currency for small everyday transactions, for which fiat works well, and electronic systems like credit/debit cards and things like paypal are quite usable.
I have a wallet on my phone, but if I were to use it to buy a quart of milk (assuming the store would take BTC payments), it would cost me double because of the tx fee. Right? Not to mention having to wait 15 min for the first network confirmation... On the other hand, if I pay with Android-pay or Apple-pay or with a card, the fee (usually paid by the store) is just a few cents, and the tx is immediate.

you are not really transferring a large sum of BTC to your ledger nano.
