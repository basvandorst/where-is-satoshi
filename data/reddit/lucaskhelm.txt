Appreciate the comment. 
Any source of information is helpful. 
Do you know of limits when it comes to purchasing? I’ve heard that 7.5k is the highest you can spend in any given week.

Interesting. Thank you.
It’s good to know it can go higher.

Are you aware if Amazon will be accepting Bitcoin or any other electronic currency in the future?
