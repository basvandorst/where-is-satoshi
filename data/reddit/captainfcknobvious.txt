BTC'S $1200+ valuation last year, it was indeed an actual hoax, setup by numerous players.

you do know when wearing stuff like that in public, its a sign saying "punch me, steal my keys, my electronics and my wallet, and then go to my house and steal all my computers, because i'm guaranteed to have a bunch of goodies waiting for you", right?

I remember when you sent A TON of BTC to that gox scam trying to buy super cheap BTC, when all the indications were all over saying it's a scam.
You seem to consistently negate rationality and good judgement in favor of hype and quick payout. I don't know if you invested in NEOBEE but damn man. You need someone to tell you to quit throwing your money at the wrong shit.

NEED TO COMBINE LIKE DOGY OR LITECOIN WITH NMC, AS ITS POINTLESS TO USE BEING SO SLOW.

It's good you can admit your faults, at least you didn't get sucked into neobee like the others did. could have been many more times than twice.
Next time you think about using more than 10K on something btc-related, PM me first and I'll look into it.
