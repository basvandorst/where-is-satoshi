I'm Dutch, he didn't take his investment out, he even still sell stuff to buy more btc lol.
He believes he can pay everything in 2020 with btc, so he never has to exchange it in euro's...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:15:24
It's not a coincidence when futures getting confirmed the buying frenzy began. 
I'm scared because I have a lot of $ in it... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:14:42

@_date: 2017-12-10 22:36:28
Sounds legit
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:31:01
I'm getting worried now.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:44:49
Tomorrow it will dip I think, like past Saturday. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:30:31
So better to wait, then buy it back?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:45:22
Ready to buy the dip boys?

@_date: 2017-12-10 21:48:06
Say what ?
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:22
Is there a reason why this shit is exploding?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:55:33
No puppet , no puppet. I mean no bubble no bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:09:47
Holy shit 5k coming in !!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:45:16
Hmm, but new people will see the big drop pre xmas, that can scare people off.
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:22:29
Abandon ship if you can !!! ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:17
Don't panic ! That's what they want ! HODL!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:36:43
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:49
Bcash going like mad
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:32:08
Sold just half of my coins, had for €30K and now cut half my risk.
I will buy back in when it's low.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:27:46
Turbulence like crazy, shaking everybody who is weak from the rocket and then turn on the engine? Sounds legit.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:17:57
Just bought , couldn't wait anymore.
Waiting for a dip cost me 2k... damn.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:50:39
I waited for a dip , now it's 1k higher... damn
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:40:27
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:17
If it went to 10K I was a genius, it's easy with hindsight . :-)
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:27:46

@_date: 2017-12-13 19:22:45
With this amount I would buy a Ledger or Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:22:17
Hopefully , otherwise we can see someone on tv eating his dick . So win win.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:30:29
Next stop €14K .
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:51:30
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:51:04
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:01:11
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:52
Good question, I waited and waited and thought it would go up again... But I still made a profit , not nearly as much it could have but with hindsight it's easy. ;-)
But that profit can melt away quickly , because my other half of coins drop now fast in value ..... 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:34:15
Losing my shit as we speak .
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:36:11
And the good way is? Cheap coins?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:58:59
Dammit, should've sold at the high, making serious money buying back in low. FML.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:09
Did I mis the opportunity to buy cheap?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:05:58
It's moving boys
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:34:48
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:24:08
Buy now or wait for a dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:51:28
I can't ,  FML
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:08:21
How do you know that?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:18:45

Fortune ?! Hold my beer.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:28:48
Damn they are abandoning ship.
Have €30k worth of bitcoin , better to sell half?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:04:16
Stabilized at 20K , oh wait it's bitcoin , never mind...
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:42:45
Fingers crossed !
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:53:48
I think good move, I sold half my coins, will buy back in at the bottom of this massive drop I hope.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:49:42

@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:15
The final countdown .
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:37:24
Getting weak hands now, sell with profit now or wait and risk loss ....
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:44:57
I wait till it hits 5K, then I throw everything I got against this evil thing !
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:45:39

If it goes down to €500 he is a crazy mfucker tho..
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:37:00

When I clicked the sell button , 1 minute after fak what have I done ?!
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:41:16

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:47
Same fml
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:57:50

@_date: 2017-12-09 00:09:17
It would be funny if it weren't so serious.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:03:01
Panic , massive panic. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:42:18

Damn sorry man, it can be 15k by then...
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:25:53
The time I could buy in and be rich as we speak. FML..
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:44:04
Sorry, it's late here in Europe :-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:52:49
WTF , almost no one sells only buys like it's the apocalyps or something.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:27:34
looking at the chart it's a downward trend 24 hours
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:54:32
Nice timing.... lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:07
Yep, learned my lesson today. Sold half , bought back in an hour later.  Weak hands.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:21:27
Price going up like crazy ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:35:31
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:31:03
DIP incoming !
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:29:30
I think it will go lower , then I attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:16:55
I remember past weekend , 2 days around €10K.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:08:39
Dude I paid 19 euro's for a transaction between desktop wallet to Ledger...  
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:08:36

How do you know
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:38:01

@_date: 2017-12-11 02:57:42
Missing the dip is painful , but still making money like crazy so.. to the MOOONNNN!
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:12:15
Yep, with hindsight you can say dammit ,but at that moment I didn't want to risk everything. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:32:10
LoL :-)
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:35:15
Think it will go way lower now, but we can't predict the future.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:39:30
Lol same, have bought a descent amount and last night I just woke up to look at the chart.... insane stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:51:28

Haha, I feel you .

@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:38
This will be the trend up and down like it's nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:26:33
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:08:39
Are we pulling on a dead horse or something?
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:48:22
Like watching paint dry..
@_date: 2017-12-24 23:37:03
Wait longer, then you can buy .5 lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:41
The panic is real now, abandon ship if you can or go down as a captain. ;-) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:18:52
Sorry , dutch boy here. So now you comment in correct dutch. ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:46:26

LOL. My sleep pattern is going to shit.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:16:49
Not yet, but it can only go down now, so thinking about it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:52:51
Give it 2 hours, it will tank more. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:59:07
Or they are a genius after the weekend... ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:11:40

Wild like steep drops or buying frenzy ?
Wan't to buy for another 4k but waiting for a good opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:38:47
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:47
$17K on GDAX. This is absurd.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:47:08
Put just in it what you can lose.
Know a dude who sold his house and living on a camping site. Huge risk but he is now virtual miljonair in just 5 month's with 300K. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:13:33

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:50:22
Lucky bastard . :-) 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:40:22
I HODL, this thing can be 20K by Christmas. This sick greed game. :-) 800 profit is great tho. Maybe sell and buy back in with your profit when it falls.
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:16:17

@_date: 2017-12-10 02:11:25
I have €30K in this greed fest, offcourse I panic by every dip . I even sold today in panic half my coins, but regret it and bought them back an hour later.
Yeah maybe this is nothing for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:45:46
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:05
RIP GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:50:01
Maybe yes , maybe not.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:20:42
What is happening, did I mis some news? Going down. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:34:38
Yup, a lot of red dildo's.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:21

As a tea drinker you must have strong hands by lifting that cup everyday . ;-)
Also Europe here , the land of the tulips ... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:14:52
Good grief, it's going down.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:39:07
Will tomorrow dip like past Saturday, because start CME? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:56:22
Hmmm again people afraid what's going to happen with CME? Down she goes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:12:24
Smells bad to me.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:01:54
Because you sold i'm losing money now like it's candy eaten by a fat kid.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:38:56
Don't panic. This is the beginning of the end.
Jokes aside, serious drop but it wil re bounce (I hope)
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:11:29
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:26:28
It's nuts, well that dip I was waiting for.. faaakkkk.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:47:51
Hmm , I want to buy more, so a dip is welcome.
Should I wait or just go full retard and buy now ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:15:13
Little dip 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:56:20
If you've 100+ BTC yes.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:07:49
You had the chance to go aboard the rocket whole week...
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:20:05
I sold earlier half my coins, can buy back in now at the same cost I sold. Should I or wait for another dip?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:03:51
congrats dude!
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:05:36
No, I bought the dip so happy camper right here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:20:25
Honestly don't know, have a ledger now. Look into making paper wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:16:22
I read different opinions , some say it goes up like crazy, or they will shorten the BTC and end up at 6K.
And others say nothing happens with the price because they not actually buy or sell BTC.
I'm sunday nervous what it's gonna be..... 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:32:27
All aboard !
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:30:49
GDAX 9.999 not kidding , even twice today. Sell wall...
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:04
Okay this is it  , HODL It's gonna be brutal !
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:25:54
Futures didn't start yet. Preparations probably.

@_date: 2017-12-17 17:48:34
A Family in the Netherlands threw everything they got in to bitcoin, sold the house , sold everything what they could mis . Total €300K invested when BTC was €2700. Now they have  around €1.83m.... gained 1.5M in 5 month's. FML.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:16:40
Testrun for Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:40:30
Sorry I mean €10K ;-)  Shit hits the fan like $7.5K shooting up after this to ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:10:52
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:52:30

@_date: 2017-12-19 13:07:27
Thinking about selling half my btc and buy eth..
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:40:36
Christ ! I have like several btc in a exodus wallet. Should I send it to a electrum wallet till I have my Ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:48:33

@_date: 2017-12-16 12:52:14

@_date: 2017-12-11 02:41:32
Earlier today I had thrown in almost everything I had,  expecting a YUGE fall so didn't. FML
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:19:32
We are going down again.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:28:29
lmao 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:28:04
10K by tomorrow then futures start and shit hits the fan .
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:42:46
Other wallets 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:18:08
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:51:41
I see, disappointing, want to buy at €10K... 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:31:54
Bought december 1st , €30K in the game. I'm f*cked basically ?
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:30:25
Me? HODL. Maybe sell 25% at the high and buy back in a dip. But that can go easily blow up in your face.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:10:45
Europe will sell in big panic, or buy like a fat kid in a candy store. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:33:18
Fuck that dip, rise Mfucker rise !
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:21:18
That would be nice to know... Buy buy buy  or sell sell sell.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:44:49
30K? Christ.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:52:52
I hope plummet, and i have €30K in this greed fest. Want some cheap coins. I believe it drops now and explodes tomorrow like to 25K then plummets again to 15 , 20k by Christmas , happy holidays.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:27:26
I sold that dip earlier... LOL..
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:22:47
I look at GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:21:45
This is a rollercoaster , up and down. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:53
Dude , I have already anxiety lol
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:12:21
Sold half of my coins .... hope too buy much lower.
Smart or weak hands ? ;-)
Fingers crossed.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:32:02
And down again....
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:45:43
Not really , I bought that dip... ;-)
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:37:58

RemindMe! 10 years
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:37:00
Somebody know an exchange where you can trade without sending your ID?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:31:23
The point is, what will be the bottom of the dip ?
Yesterday I bought for 20k almost at the bottom, but today I lose (virtual) money like an animal. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:06:06
Like to know too..
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:12:20
Can someone explain me this ? At the GDAX chart it's 8,870 euro, but on this chart it's much lower?! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:08:45
Don't get it too.
Everywhere different charts.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:21:01
Weird or what ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:50:43
I wanted to buy at 9500 euro's this morning... lol
I think I wait , see how far it drops and then  buy like a maniac .
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:02:33
Yep, I'm safe again, you ? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:11:14
Christmas is coming.... don't know if that's positive bitcoin wise 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:18:08
Buy now or wait ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:08:16
Just think yesterday and today large players cashed out.
It goes up and down all the time.
I'm way to late to get rich even if it hits $100K , so I see this like a game, you can win or loose. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:16:27
I bought for 20k an hour ago. Genius or idiot ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:31:26
Ok , feel better now. I need something for my anxiety tho.. lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:10:30
What a time to be alive...
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:18:07
Same, bought for 20k yesterday...   HEEEEELLLLPPPP!!! ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:58:31
Damn, wanna buy at the dip but can't... It drops again , fasten your seat-belts !!
