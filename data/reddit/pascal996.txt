That's not a t3. Looks more like an MB100.

That's very unlikely. However he will receive documents and a job as a firefighter \(he was an illegal\) which is cool :\)

Not only old, bud also fake. The "how to sell" part never happened.

Looks like we're trying to talk to either zombies or people from that exchange trying to sell their shit. Look how "revolutionary" this is! In that case just code a bot with that feature and get rich.

Crap. It used to be available on Kraken. In my experience, price would just come down to hit your stop loss and go back up.

Please respect prostitutes as they provide a service for the money. Thank you.

OP is pretending kraken replied to my post which is wrong. You can see the reply comes from an account that is not listed here [ I would suggest to not click on any of the links from this account. Btw I said that kraken USED TO have trailing stops, which you would already know if you were not at best a noob or/and a clueless scammer.

Well, it just happened to me. I don't touch it and see if/when they'll touch it. Ticket opened.
