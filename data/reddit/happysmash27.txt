Gee, after reading a bunch on that site, I have no idea what to do. On one hand, I don't want to lose my USD value, but on the other, I really don't want to lose my crypto value. Perhaps I should just diversify…
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:40:48
Holy cow, I just realised that a 9 year old could have actually typed that.
@_date: 2019-07-24 02:09:20
Wait, what‽ Wow!
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:55:10
I get an access denied error.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:55:55
But I don't even know how much I have…
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:35:53
I'm talking about the transferrer not knowing, not the IRS.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:57:35
Don't they only start taxing when one makes $11,000, therefore is above the poverty line?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:57:57
Do you have any info on that? It sounds interesting.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:51:10
What if one has switched so many times they don't even know what transfers have been done?
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:53:02
Only if you make more than 11,000 a year, from what I understand.
@_date: 2018-08-15 20:05:05
Por qué no los dos?
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:35:22
Minetest, mostly. While I am writing this, I am playing SimCity 4. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:11:40
I believe the cost got higher when the price was higher. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:03:15
I feel fine…
@_date: 2018-08-07 17:13:04
I GPU mine cryptocurrency while playing games, because at least currently, the games are light enough to run fine. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 21:01:28
Bitcoin is still over $6000. I expected this to be way worse…
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:59:56
I wonder how many people here have actually made millions…
@_date: 2018-10-18 19:58:56
That's a lot of green candles. Usually there is at least small variation…
@_date: 2018-10-31 14:01:46
Wow! It's amazing how long it's been…
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:21:37
Naw, segwit Bitcoin is the altcoin in my opinion. BCH has less changes.
@_date: 2017-08-09 07:31:20
According to many people, now is always the best time to buy. Even if there is a correction, it will likely rise back up even higher anyway...
Bitcoin is severely undervalued now according to a source I recently read, and it will likely rise into the future a LOT.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:12:29
So how can I keep both my bitcoin cash and bitcoin? They appear to take the same directory...
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:29:31
Holy cow, I haven't received my paycheck yet so can't buy it! What is going on?!?!?
(please crash a bit, please crash a bit...)

@_date: 2018-06-03 23:32:48
Woah, I just found this post and it appears that it is still there! This will be an interesting puzzle to solve…
@_date: 2018-06-25 02:58:00
Has BTC ever dropped to that percentage of its ATH? I think below $500 is very unlikely. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:43:45
Heavier-than-air transport is pretty impractical if one wants to use it renewably, though! Airships are much more efficient. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:28:34
Bitcoin won't die as long as I use it to pay bills. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 04:31:32

@_date: 2018-11-27 15:27:20
Woah, Bitcoin is less than $4000‽‽‽ That's almost as low as my original investment! 
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:14:56
Lol, I used Paxfull as a minor and it was around $1000 higher…
@_date: 2017-09-14 05:55:50
Check the price again.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:46:09
RemindMe! April 12 2028
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:10:46
So is this why Bitcoin keeps dropping and recovering at a very boring rate over and over again?
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:42:14
What was the broken one?
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:53:40
I did the same thing at a slightly lower price, because that's when I got my first job.
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:47:10
Wouldn't it be likely that a lot of sports cars would be electric by then though, including Lambos?
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:11:19
That would be awesome! If that happened I could finally buy a whole Bitcoin :D
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:58:16
Fold? Is this a reference like hodl?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:15:11
Why not? Why shouldn't I be able to invest my own money?
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:56:27
Do you have an example of such a business? I would really like to price things in Bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:17:57
Same with many on Paxful, with 25% fees :/
I'm still waiting for it to hit $5000 so I can finally break even! Although I made some pretty good investments with other coins, so it's already happened prematurely a couple of times…
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:53:46
I just put almost all of my money in it when I got my first job, leaving a bit to buy a few things I needed as well as emergencies. Unfortunately it wasn't enough though :/
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:35:22
I'm not sure if, with advice like this, I should risk it and invest a bit in Tether, or continue to HODL…
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:42:14
What was the broken one?
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:06:21
I just turned 16, but about a month before my birthday I spent over $800 on Bitcoin…
I have more than that in most altcoins!
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:45:15
Wow, China is banning a lot…
@_date: 2018-02-27 15:37:45
980 to 1080 to 2080? That's a bit of a jump…
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:06:51
I bought at 15 at Paxful.
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:01:25
But why do they need to? And how can they hold anyone responsible if most people are anonymous anyway? And shouldn't things like this be up to the website or sellers, who take the risk themselves?
@_date: 2017-09-01 05:48:50
RemindMe! 12 months

But aren't loans a bad thing?

@_date: 2017-09-10 03:55:37
It doesn't seem very volatile to me, seeing as if it goes down it usually goes back up in a couple of days…
Sure, it may be volitile day-to-day. But so far, the returns have gone up consistently every year.
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:46:34

@_date: 2017-10-18 06:39:23
Isn't that a bit disrespectful to homeless people?
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:49:31
I just searched "crypto price libreoffice" in DuckDuckGo. Guess what I found… (this exact page)
Any updates yet? I just made a cool sheet in LibreOffice Calc and want to have live prices.
@_date: 2017-09-10 01:16:36
And why does that matter? Bitcoin is bought up front, after all.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:15:31
Or perhaps in precious metals. That's what I plan on doing…
@_date: 2017-09-14 01:59:08
Isn't that how it's supposed to be used though?
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:13:11
But it can be used to buy more Bitcoin…
@_date: 2017-09-14 06:15:06
I don't have any debt. I'm not a slave, right?
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:15:18
Do you know where one buys things priced in Bitcoin, btw? I prefer those but can't find much…
@_date: 2017-09-10 03:28:13
No, the money I got at the very good summer job I had. My birthday money too, though; I am not lucky enough to get an actual stable allowance.
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:20:09
I'm pretty sure that was the point.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:23:49
Why is it so bad? I like it.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:25:43
Could bitcoin drop? Should I wait to buy more?
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:35:06
I got a deal on Paxful and got my bitcoin within a couple of minutes.
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:00:04
Several people are actually saying it may this year, so it is actually a pretty big concern.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:54:47
Do you think it will go lower? I don't have many bitcoins now.
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:27:07
Misleading title... it could happen, but it's just a prediction.
@_date: 2019-05-11 00:54:01
Waa??? 
Wow, my investments are increasing again!
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:15:50
Because that is the meme. [Even I use them in my stock imagery]( and I hate fossile-fuel muscle cars! 
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:12:43
Oh yeah? Well I got *two* lambos, and put them on the moon!* 
*Lambos are 3d models and the moon in the picture is too. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:07:12
What are they then? 
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:55:18
"confirmed liars, propagandists, shitcoin pumpers and hostile takeover participants", which is what the person you were responding to was talking about.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:50:57
Oh, so *that's* why "Juhad" and "Wu" are mixed together…
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:18:13
[Me too](
@_date: 2017-07-21 05:54:11
Should I buy now? I missed the big drop.
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:48:22
So… who actually supports those people other than them themselves.
