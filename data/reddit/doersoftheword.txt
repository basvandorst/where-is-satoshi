Sarcasm aside, come back when (the Internet) has survived for over 4,000 years like gold. (The Internet's) history of success is tiny and is not a reliable indicator of what it will do in the future. This (dot com bust) is 100% justified. Maybe (fax machines) will rise to these levels again one day but (the Internet) is intrinsically worth nothing due to its (scaling/speed/security) issues, among others.

Your defense of OP's post is largely an "attack the messenger" fallacy.  The motivation for OP's posts doesn't really matter.  They are right to be concerned about the safety of the community and reputation of bitcoin.  Of course who Alex Green is and where his company resides is also moot as we saw with Karpeles and Gox.

The word "hoarding" is used generally when people take more than they need and refuse to use the object in question BECAUSE it is in short supply (e.g. hoarding gas during a shortage).  It's appropriate for bitcoin since the supply will always be limited and unlike fiat, if everyone decides to "save" it instead of spending it, the network effects disappear.
It's easy for me to imagine people not spending it, because I rarely spend mine.  Everyone will always have bitcoin and fiat (so there is no need to spend your bitcoin).  bitcoin can't earn interest either (in bitcoin), so it's necessary to be used alongside another currency.  I treat my bitcoin like it's gold, or a rare painting.  Would you buy items on overstock.com with a Renoir?

Couple of reasons why you should do it:
1.  Current customer base will hear about it.  Help bitcoin grow.
2.  Open yourself to a new customer base (International?).
3.  Very easy and cheap to take bitcoin and have it converted to USD as others have mentioned. Coinbase and Bitpay.
It's not a "waste" to implement a payment system that no one uses YET.  Would it be a waste to create a website in the early days of the Internet?  Clearly not.  Those who got in early have the most advantages.  Even more so when implementing bitcoin has very small costs and evangelises technology you believe in.

Oh sorry, I'm still sold on the "value of bitcoin is the network effects" line I hear everywhere.  When I talk about bitcoin theoretically, it's always after the block rewards are gone.
I'm new to bitcoin but maybe I'm misunderstanding, if everyone stops mining, the bitcoin protocol is still useful somehow?  Is there some supposition that people will mine without rewards&gt;
Maybe "dies" is a strong word.  Is "crashes" more appropriate?

Better to read about Ayn Rand's history and realize that like many people who experienced the full brunt of socialism first-hand, they tend to love capitalism.  With that comes some romanticizing of "pure capitalism" as opposed to the somewhat messy hybrid we deal with in reality.

The point you're missing is that Keynesians believe that the government can effectively manipulate currency through policy to the benefit of society.  Bitcoin offers no such function and is quite in-flexible in this regard.
So if interest rates beat inflation and people are hoarding money, the Keynesian would drop interest rates and "force" people to "do good" with their money, or raise taxes on savings, or some other top-down mechanism.
Keynesism (is that a word?) is essentially about power and who will have it.  They are necessarily at odds with bitcoin.

As you can see by the comments, bitcoin is still working on ease of use and security.  Here's my take.
  Don't put a lot of money in bitcoin.  It's just not mature yet.  Keep some pocket change but that's all.  There are so many "gotchas" that it's not worth it.  And you're not going to spread the popularity of bitcoin by suggesting to your friends that they buy a $199 bitcoin paper wallet printer.  Just silly.
  Use a muiltisig online hot wallet with 2 factor authentication.  Note that your phone becomes a single point of failure if both your auth factors are accessible by the phone. (see 
  Don't use any "brain wallet" or BIP38 encrypted stuff where you pick a "passphrase".  People are notoriously bad at generating passphrases.  Or do-so but see 
I know people are down vote me for this, but any "solution" that suggests a regular person download a git source on a virgin ubuntu OS on a computer with the ethernet and wifi disabled in the kernel (100m underground) to print paper wallets is ridiculous in my opinion.

Smart investors will have sold their mining equipment long before the last block is mined.  Mining is expensive and the equipment won't last long given how people push it.  As the equipment dies, it won't be replaced.
You think that miners will keep mining to prop up bitcoin, but think they would more likely sell out.  I see your points, but I don't share your optimism.  I believe there will be considerable issues after the last block is mined.  But I shouldn't say it will die, lest I hurt the value of my own BTC.  Guess I'm hopeful.

Not a dumb question, but I think it's too early to tell.  They are probably focused on getting in all 50 states and expanding internationally.

Some don't have access to an exchange, others prefer the anonymity. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 21:57:59
Honestly if you need to ask, keep it there.  Do more research, move a small amount to other places and test them out so if you lose anything it won't be that bad.
Point is, once you've opened a Coinbase account the cat is out of the bag so you might as well enjoy the security and ease of use the service provides.  You can't re-acquire any anonymity unless you purchase new bitcoins from some other means.

My company has unlimited time off.  Basically you get bonuses for billable hours so there's incentives to put in the hours.  But that said, when you're not actually busy is there any reason to pretend you're working?  Nope.

Vaccines should be defended for the health of society, but you're create unrealistic expectations regarding their safety.  Medicine isn't an exact science.

As many have stated, it's not a "wallet" technically.  But it is a very easy way to purchase and store bitcoins.  In my opinion, it's best solution for American users that are intending to use bitcoin entirely "above-board" .

It's no different than telling everyone you have $250k in cash in your closet.  There's literally no reason to expose yourself like this.

If "people aren't honest" why would you add more people into your transaction?  Intermediaries are people too.  Whatever method by which you establish trust with an intermediary, you can just establish with your transaction partner and eliminate the intermediary.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:30:29
Just like cash.  All transactions come with risk to someone.  But transactions without intermediaries are better.

So you scribble on the receipt?  Investigation?  This isn't Law and Order.  There aren't people looking at receipts comparing your signature to the signature there.  No one is reviewing the security camera footage.    
Haven't you had your CC stolen before?  You simply call the CC company and they reverse everything no questions asked.  Then they ship you a new card.  There is no "investigation".
Maybe you're having a hard time believing that it's this easy, but what you're missing is that most people are just honest.  And the potential consequences ward off most of the rest.
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:18:50
Not really.  If someone holds a gun to your head it really doesn't matter if it's a bank or a wallet.  You would login to your bank website and do whatever they say.
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:07:50
So, maybe this is just the US.  I had a credit card stolen a few years back.  Called the company and all charges reversed.  No fuss.  Nothing.  Source where anyone has ever been sued for charging back by a merchant?  I'm skeptical.
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:19:32
I think more of the problem is that it's trivially easy to do.  So you could theoretically \~try\~ to double spend every transaction.  Because of the decentralized nature of bitcoin, there's no way to stop you (like with a credit card that would track charge\-backs and eventually cancel your card).

X and Y are better actually.  Integers include negatives which is impossible for the blockchain and don't include fractions which might be a possibility for the percentage.

All that vs. "go grab your deck of cards".
@_date: 2015-07-20 16:51:03
Probably not today.  There's probably an app for any game you'd likely play with them.
But a deck of cards was a kickass gaming platform for a long time :)

I've used it quite a bit and here's my recommendations:
    1.  Always purchase items with Prime.  These transactions resolve a lot faster and there's less lag time for the price of bitcoin to change dramatically between your original purchase of the bitcoin and the transferral.
    2.  Try to always purchase from Amazon.  Your transaction is essentially a gift.  So you need a merchant with a very liberal return policy if there are issues.
    3.  I have to buy big things (physically).  This may not apply for others, but a lot of my mail gets lost and misdelivered.  That doesn't happen for large boxes though, mostly letters.
    4.  Buy gift cards.  If you have a very reliable carrier, you can get Southwest cards and Whole Foods at 30% off and that can make a real difference in the budget.
@_date: 2015-07-09 16:22:47
You can use it to purchase Amazon Gift cards then use that to buy items directly.  I find this to be a much better process (especially if you're a buy/test/return type of Amazon user).
Edit:  Physical gift cards.  Not the email delivered kind.

So the saying "hold my beer" is a common parlance of American southern alcohol-fueled "one-ups-manship" that normally qualifies the speaker for the Darwin awards.
"hold my pepsi" is the same stab with the drink adjusted to the type of person, or perhaps to imply the person is a child too young to drink.
@_date: 2016-09-09 15:08:18
That's the hopeful proposition that I'm rooting for, but it seems unlikely given human nature.

Scary right?  This is the thing about bitcoin that opponents say is an issue that proponents dismiss.  It is the inherent problem with a deflationary asset that you don't *have* to use.

Self regulation is exactly what crypto markets need.  Show us the data supporting your scammy looking exchange volume, or validate you have actual USD backing your tethered coin, etc.

You'd be stupid to spend it while the value is rising when you can just spend USD instead.  Especially because the value of USD is going down.  
Not sure why you think there we are on the verge of resource capacity when we are awash in $40 oil.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:43:41
This is the issue with deflationary "currencies".  Like trying to use Van Gogh paintings to buy groceries.  The incentive is to HODL, which discourages use, which creates bubbles, which then bust.
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:39:14
Literally the first thing I noticed was that comparison didn't match.  Very misleading.

Same as credit cards so not really a novel problem with bitcoin.  Bitcoin transactions can happen over SMS too.  So it's not necessary that you have power or Internet at the point of the transaction, only cell service.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:53:23
The price of bitcoin is unrelated to the cost to mine it.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:06:49
I think that is a smaller issue than people currently having no guarantee that their vote is counted at all.  Hanging chads, lost ballots, ballots found in people's cars, etc are real issues that happen every election.  Bitcoin makes the vote verifiable (I can know my vote counted, but that information is private).  Further, Congressmen whose votes are public must answer for those votes.  Transparency is better.
@_date: 2015-04-09 14:24:03
Yes, I doubt it.  Like most conspiracies, they overestimate people's ability to keep a secret.  If this was happening in any meaningful way, we would have heard about it by now.  Can you post one single reference to this occurring from a reputable news source?  Doubtful.  Why buy votes when you can buy ads that have the same effect?
@_date: 2015-04-07 15:46:42
"If it can't work perfectly from the get-go best to just stop trying."  --said no innovator ever.
Edit:  The "vote buying"/"vote bullying" arguments are moot.  This could be done with absentee ballots today and I've NEVER heard of this happening in the US.  Blockchain doesn't make this any easier or less illegal.  The risk is too high for the reward.
@_date: 2015-04-07 21:58:29
With the blockchain it seems you should be able to verify how YOU voted without others knowing how you voted.  Others might be able to compel you to vote a certain way, but how is that any different than an absentee ballot?  Not really a valid concern.
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:58:31
In a lot of places you can't buy groceries with cash anymore either.
@_date: 2015-04-07 22:00:39
Someone can compel you today with an absentee ballot and have a full record of your vote.  This is really a non-issue.  The blockchain does provide you of a receipt of how you voted and that's good for verifying authenticity of the votes counted.  And no hanging chads.

Makes sense because you can sell your product online, doesn't really make sense for the taco guy.  If you're going to go through the trouble of accepting it, you should take the time to train so that it's not a frustrating experience for your workers or customers.  If you aren't getting enough bitcoin business to justify training, then drop it.  Having it half-ass implemented is worse than not at all.
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:37:01
TL;DR: new tech (not just bitcoin) requires new processes and training.
I ate at a restaurant over the weekend that was using the "TabbedOut" app for managing payments.  Basically allows you to download your tab and pay it online instead of paying the server.  Lady behind me ordered at the bar, but the bartender couldn't bring up the order online.  She had to pay with a CC instead.  I immediately thought about bitcoin and the challenges managing the payments.  Training is essential for acceptance.
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:19:24
But you see the usefulness right?  Cash (and bitcoin) have the advantage of allowing direct transactions where a middleman doesn't make sense (allowance), isn't interested in participating (craigslist), or the transaction is too small (tipping).  So no, it's not a good option for buying something from an untrustworthy dealer in China, but perhaps it's better than carrying a wad of hundreds to a craigslist deal or if you wanted to pay your daughter her allowance when she's on a college trip to Europe.

It's the same way you'd be treated by reddit if you posted that you fell for a Nigerian scam.  It has nothing to do with bitcoin and everything to do with people repeatedly falling for scams which redditors view as obvious.
