I'm sitting in the cafeteria at work getting someone to uninstall the bitcoin.com wallet for coinbase as they were confused between bcash and bitcoin. I opened reddit and showed them this video, she said "he should be arrested for fraud". I told her he's already wanted in the US for selling explosives.

I love the sentiment, but isn't the whole idea of Bitcoin that he can spend it? Doesn't advising him to lock it in a safe and only hold it go against promoting adoption?
I understand what you are trying to do, but personally, I think a better idea would be to set up a mobile wallet for him and tell him how he can spend it online, and even accept it as payment for his work.

This channel taught me everything about using GDAX that I use, but these videos relate to your exact questions:
But as for the "ELI5":
The stop part is the price at which something happens, like an "on" switch. If the stop price is equal to the last trade price then 1 of 2 things happen.
If you have put a number in the limit box, it will place a limit order for that number, exactly as if you were sat there placing the limit order yourself.
If you leave the limit box empty, you will place an order at whatever the market price is.
So that answers the "how they are used", but as for their "purpose" they are just a tool for you to use in whatever way you can think of. This guy runs through some strategies:
Trading strategy can't really be explained in very simple terms, as it's a very complex thing. But 2 very simple strategies would be as follows:
1) Placing a sell order slightly below the market price.
The point of this, is so if your investment begins to drop while you are asleep, it will place a sell order to make sure you dont lose out because of the dip.
Similarly, you can place the order above the market price if you want to squeeze a bit more profit out - but this is riskier as a "profit-saving" order as it may not reach that point before dropping.
2) Placing a buy order below the market price
In this scenario, you place the order and then go to bed. During the night the value drops, because of your order you automatically grab a big chunk of the coin at a bargain price. Unfortunately Dave next door didn't place a stop order and missed out, he woke up and the price is nearly back to yesterday's market value.
I hope I helped!

I have some experience with this.
My Ledger Nano S fell on the floor just last week and I ran it over with my chair cracking the screen :c
However, I had my 24 words to hand so I quickly found a lightweight wallet with BIP39 support. Downloaded Bither, entered the words, accessed my wallet and xferred the funds to an exchange.
Past week I tried my hand at day trading since I was keeping my funds on an exchange anyway, made some profit and it was pretty fun - can't wait for my new Ledger to arrive so I can withdraw my funds to safety!

Maybe when they return the $850 tjey stole or if someone at least spoke to me about where it is I'd support them a little more.

Once we fend off the Segwit2x attack, there will far fewer questions and uncertainties - prices should jump I'd hope!
I can see 8k by December and 10k mid January is nothing goes terribly wrong!

 One Bitcoin is quite large (hundreds of £/$/€) so people often deal in smaller units. The most common subunits are listed below:
Seems a little outdated, seeing as we just hit $7000!

Last night I did 60 sat/byte tx to move my legacy coins to a SW address.
1 confirmation when I checked an hour later, 6 when I woke up.

If you could throw together a shirt that says
"This is my Bitcoin, there are 21 million like it but this one is mine"
That would be great, do you ship worldwide?

I'm excited, looking forward to seeing it!

Fee averages take ages to move. If you set a custom fee for 30 (slow), 50 (normal), 70 (fast) it should go through fine.

Shame I couldn't make bitcoin payment.
Order placed, looking forward to receiving it! Just like I support Bitcoin as a currency I love helping businesses that support Crypto.
While you are working on BTC integration, definitely look in to LTC as well. Lots of merchant advice on it here:
Might help with your BTC integration too, who knows \^^

Currently Bitcoin is rather unpredictable, as there are a lot of good and bad things happening at once so it could go anywhere.
The good being that without S2X investors are putting more Fiat in, as there is supposedly less uncertainty so the price could be going up.
However, S2X was offering, essentially, free money for Bitcoin holders so BTC has been artificially inflated. Now S2X is no more people are sprinting back to their criminally undervalued altcoins.
Basically, you could invest now and you might see some good returns as more people invest and the coin stabilizes again, or you might see a further 10-15% drop as people continue to invest in alts. Personally I'm split 60%/25%/15% with Litecoin, Ethereum and Bitcoin respectively.
As was previously mentioned however, learn the tech from all the coins you are interested in. Crypto isn't about making a quick profit, and it's not even about making a long term profit at it's core. It's about investing in what tech you see as the best choice for the future of currency.

Yeah, I feel you buddy.
I used to work in B2B sales, but I couldn't even consider approaching customers directly, completely cold as well! I always imagine just feeling like a stereotypical "knock on your door" annoyance.
But hey, I'll be walking around in this shirt and doing what I can to help out the community!
Litecoin is great for a small business like yourself, lightning makes for instant transactions (resistance to buyers remorse, where someone might change their mind because it may take a few hours for their order to get placed!), low tx fees (makes the option more competitive, without you putting yourself out with high fees).
Oh yeah, also free marketing by registering here:
Best of luck dude, looking forward to my new shirt!

Make a private pastebin with the seed, get a tinyurl link to the seed which is easy to remember.
Highly insecure, but cool to think about and easy to do.

I'm only 19 and pay my mother rent for the room, to get her onboard with Bitcoin I helped her open a wallet and now make my rent payments to her in BTC each month.

Just checked Gemini out for a bit, and got myself registered and sent my documents for verification - unfortunately it looks like they only accept USD payments, I'm in the UK so it would take 2-3 days to transfer and convert my money to USD which kind of nullifies the whole point of using Gemini \^^
