No, no, this guy is an assclown. If you read all Satoshi's posts, it's the opposite personality. I call it BS 99.99%.

Are you aware that not only increase block limit is being discussed, but also critic issues as centralization, break of consensus, longest chain ignoring, and giving or not complete control of bitcoin development to a couple of persons ?

Remember that pools are competing between them, not all pools will stay fair to the others, they will do a big block attack if possible. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 12:16:17
The problem with raising limits is that the pools which have better internet connections, will mine really big blocks in detriment to those which are not so well connected. Small full nodes will suffer, also orphan rates will increase considerably.

For what I understand, both sidechains and lightning network transactions are provisory, and they consolidate at the main blockchain at the end.
@_date: 2015-11-28 23:17:41


I don't think it's more difficult on a user-level, than any other payment. Let's compare making a payment online with a credit card, you need to fill a form with CC number, CCV, expire time, etc. vs. scan a QR code with bitcoin. Bitcoin wins.


Very easy with a paper wallet.


Forget reversability as an advantage, reversability is heaven for fraudsters and poison for online payments.


EURO lost 30% against USD last year, that can be stressful too.


Bitcoin future and present is brilliant in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-11-12 13:17:20
To increase the blocksize is not the proper solution, but a federation of blockchains that consolidate with the upper one, being the bitcoin blockchain the consolidation of last resort.
@_date: 2015-11-12 12:36:10
Argument is weak, if you need to increase blocksize, there is no maximum cap that would be sufficient to accomodate all world transactions. In the case of off-chain transactions, at certain time, they need to be consolidated in the main blockchain. Fees will grow either by consolidations volume or by fee amount by transaction, each bitcoin price wil also grow after each halving. There is no solution for bitcoin growth if you do not add N layers to it.

You need to understand that AOL was a commercial service, Bitcoin is a protocol, a technology breakthrough, nobody was pushing UDP back then. Anyway, there are 100's of millions in Bitcoin startups right now, for a new generation of services and apps fueled by the protocol.

There is more than 100k transactions per day (50k btc / hour), you can see publicly that the transactions with potential problems i.e. insufficient fees or technical issues, are a very very tiny percentage of the total.

If so, please take that 40 minutes BS from your post because is not true, to send coin from address a to address b is INSTANT.

Sure, go use your credit card instead (180 days confirmation time). /s
@_date: 2015-10-11 23:21:18
You are talking BS. Bitcoin payments are instant, what it takes 10 to 60 minutes is the assurance that payment will be irreversible forever. In comparison, that time is usually 180 days for credit cards.

Confirmation time is merely a merchant decission. I've just been using a sports betting service that relies on 0-conf, so sending funds with bitcoin is instant. 
In the case of credit cards, you need to remember that you are also registered with all your bio data (and your account money) with your fellow bank, so add all that prior registering and paperwork time to the CC confirmations.
So, 1-6 confirmations for bitcoin is a tradeoff between being secure to the merchant, while not needing to do any paperwork at any bank. If a bitcoin bank like coinbase is used instead, 0-conf are perfectly secure to merchant too.
