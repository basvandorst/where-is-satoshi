Mintpal! I really enjoyed the UI of that exchange. Luckily, I didn't have anything on there when they went down.

Is there a Lightning Network api that will allow me to listen for lightning payments?

This "contentious fork" is effectively bcash's life support. There's no better way to prevent people from selling than the promise of more forked coins to dump.

As many have already noted, you won't make much mining Bitcoin, but lower difficulty, different algo altcoins instead. With your setup you can probably make between 0.75 - 4 USD per day depending on the difficulty of the coin(s) you mine and electricity costs. Imo this is one of the best ways to learn about cryptocurrency and the incentive structure behind it. Best of luck and have fun :-)

It was previously 0.05%:
"The European Central Bank has cut its main interest rate to 0% from 0.05% as part of a package of measures intended to revive the eurozone economy."

It's kind of in the name...

I wonder if they're going to implement normal on-chain transactions or dabble with lightning payments as well. Either way, it's exciting news, but a lightning implementation would be over the top.

“Banks need to implement instant payments as soon as possible and provide an alternative narrative to the ongoing public debate on the alleged innovation brought by virtual currency schemes,”
Specifically, "Provide an alternative narrative" regarding the "alleged innovation" of "virtual currency schemes." Is this quote not telling?

No. In my opinion, anyone pushing for a change in PoW is either misinformed or shilling for bcash. Remember they are trying to take Bitcoin's name. Changing the PoW is exactly what they want Bitcoin to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:38:52
Couldn't agree more. Now that mining hardware is approaching the limits of existing chipsets we should start to see fewer improvements/increases in the hashing power of each new miner on the market. Once that happens mining equipment will be profitable for longer periods of time and encourage more people to enter the ecosystem. If you can't tell, I'm pretty optimistic about mining eventually becoming more decentralized over time.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:45:50
Indeed, competition will do that. I doubt they will innovate much if at all though. Probably just enough to be able to market their services as being "blockchain driven" (updated SQL databases with pixie dust).
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:26:32
That's a bold claim though. There's no evidence that miners are going to continue to support bcash long-term, it's unsustainable for all participants. Regardless of this short-term attack and fud campaign the incentive structure built into Bitcoin is steady. Miners are mining the most profitable coin and traders at legitimate exchanges are playing off of this and trading accordingly.
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:56:55
I've already said it, but I believe a push for Bitcoin to change PoW is the next part of bcash's plan. Remember, they are trying to take Bitcoin's name. Changing the PoW is exactly what they want Bitcoin to do.
Edit/Additional Clarification: 
Certain altcoins exist for the sole purpose of remaining ASIC resistant. Changing Bitcoin's PoW would relegate Bitcoin's status to that of an altcoin. So even if the PoW was changed a similar threat would pop up for the given algorithm that Bitcoin changed to resulting in another PoW change and another and another and so forth. All the while bcash can aggregate all of Bitcoin's previous hashing power to it's own chain and claim they are "Bitcoin".

Be wary, there's an agenda being pushed here. Bcash supporters want nothing more than for Bitcoin to change PoW so that most of the dedicated ASIC's currently used to secure the Bitcoin network are instead pointed to the Bcash chain in order to remain profitable. They would then claim to be the "most secure chain".
See the previous thread on it here:

Just finished s2 recently and noticed they really upped their cryptocurrency game. Excited to see where they take that in s3.

I've been wondering what specs you could get by with as well. There are a few tutorials on setting up a full-node with a Ras-pi, but I've found the Ras-pi setup to be pretty unreliable. I'm considering moving it to something like this with an external hard-drive:

That's my use-case for the shift card as well. I'm hoping they add an automatic buy-back option if you spend over x amount, but other than that it's super handy.

I literally just purchased Deus Ex: Mankind Divided from Steam. I prefer purchasing with Bitcoin so that I don't have to pass and expect merchants to hold my sensitive and insecure credit card data. I also much rather push funds to them instead of trusting them to pull funds from me. We need to move away from these pull-based legacy systems. Any Bitcoin spent is then immediately replenished using gdax.

Nice! Can't seem to find the soundbite though.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:55:58
I don't see a problem with that though. While cards are completely against what Bitcoin stands for it's a great on ramp/transition for people who are not accustomed to using cryptocurrencies yet. Something akin to a starter e-mail, I guess.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:53:38
Why do we not see more implementations of bitid in the crypto space? It seems like that should be the go-to method. Am I missing something that makes this a bad idea?

- So if I understand this, a man-in-the-middle can still hijack your session after you post the signed hash to the server?
- I would argue that this one is a feature as it shifts security and account access privileges squarely onto the user instead of relying on each vendor to keep your information safe and to not give an unauthorized user account access/reset privileges.
