I'm glad you asked. All received transactions are immediately invested in ASIC-ARMORY.com.
If we want to be really sure we just make a payment at ButterflyLabs.

This one pays out a lot more:

I've heard [bitcoinscam]( is quite good.

I heard bitcoinscam.org as a pretty cheeky one...
@_date: 2013-10-23 20:09:37
I can assure you that is not going to happen. We have taken security measure to ensure that, should we ever by accident make any payouts, they will never go to anyone who sent Bitcoins to us.

bitcoinscam will not judge you.
Just do what you have to do!

bitcoinscam here
We are currently planning a new service which allows you to lose your Bitcoins without having to use any device whatsoever. Just submit the private keys to the addresses you want to lose and we will empty them.

You're absolutely right. There is no way whatsoever to prove that we don't have control over the addresses being emptied at our service.
So we were probably more surprised than anyone in the world about the 0.7BTC sent to us.

No shit! 
Tell your wife you made yourself immortal on the wall of scam:

Dear user,
sorry for the inconvenience. We shortly switched the service to our vanity address 1scamqWYiVspdfHwpvgwv8ge2GTNQDAWL in order to allow for the most comfortable user experience. For past transactions please refer to
