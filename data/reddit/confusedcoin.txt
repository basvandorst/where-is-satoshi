Coinbase has informed users that they have reported the profile as per compliance when trading activity crosses a certain threshold. 
So, it should probably be these 14K people who might have got letters. 
Also, it's not just who cashed out on Coinbase, it is people who traded on Coinbase or GDAX above $10K in transactions or more than 10,000 trades in a year.
More information on what is in these letters and how to react if you have already reported gains or losses on your taxes is provided [here](

Was watching some interesting documentaries around money and bitcoin, so what flag men can do was intriguing and provoked such thoughts. Hope it never happens :\)

Either crypto to crypto or crypto to fiat sale is taxable. You need to identify all such buy and sell and match them by FIFO. File them as one entry but need to have a record of all these transactions for any possible audit in the future. 
Alternatively, You can use one of the tax [software]( and get your capital gains document (8949 if in the US) and provide it to your accountant. (Software does all the hard work and generates the document).
He should be able to take it from there.  
You can even export to Turbotax directly and file yourself. 
Not financial advice! If your situation is even more complicated, this software will get you in touch with CPA that understands crypto.

Do you have to do it manually?! [BearTax]( matches them all automatically without any manual effort. Even between Coinbase and Binance and avoids any unnecessary taxable events unless it is a Sale of an asset. Give it a try. They also give you a preview of gain-loss without any payment.

Bitcoin never said or is intended to hide from the government. 
You always have to pay their share on your earnings, if you intend to trade. 
Bitcoin only provides freedom from inflation and state-owned currencies and could be a global store of value like Gold.
If you just receive it from someone, you don't have to pay taxes. You pay taxes only when sell and realize gains or losses. Be sure to collect their cost-basis (purchase price) when you got them, else it will be calculated against a 0 price or the price on the date you received on (which could lead to higher gains than you actually have)

Bitcoin is decentralized, but not anonymous. To be legalized as a monetary product, it has to be regulated. The regulation comes with a price. 
A piece of land is a natural resource, but why do we pay capital gains? 
Same with Bitcoin - it has to be treated as one of the financial products and it's considered property in many countries. That's how IRS or ATO or HMRC sees it. 
Whether you disclose or not, government authorities can track down addresses holding bitcoin to individuals and come back at you if you have traded or made profits off Bitcoin - it could be in Fiat or just trading crypto to crypto. There are firms dedicated to analyzing on-chain and off-chain transactions that help authorities achieve this. That's one reason why many got [letters]( and [notices]( for not reporting, under-reporting, misreporting their crypto holdings.
IRS has provided updated guidance on what's considered an income, what's a capital gain or loss in their latest FAQs. It is always in our best interest to comply and pay the taxes to be safe.

Exchanges cannot really provide a tax report. Even if they provide, it will be useful only for those beginners who just buy and sell only on one exchange like Coinbase. Most of the cases, people move their coins across exchanges, wallets and more causing their report to be worthless.

When you sell during the next bull run, it would be a taxable event. Assuming you bought more than a year ago - it would be a long term capital gain. 
Once you sell, you can calculate your capital gains using a platform like [BearTax]( and download the auto-generated 8949 capital gains document (assuming you're in the US), else the CSV that you can combine with your income statement and file your taxes. 
Tax rate depending on your income bracket would be different for long-term vs short-term. So that would be an advantage if you held it for more than 12 months. 
PS: I am not an accountant and if it's a huge amount - please consult a qualified professional for your tax needs.

6174 letters could mean transactions done in any of recent years too. 
So, they might not be implying your records from 2013 - but consult an accountant who is well aware of such situations and file with them.

You can use BearTax, which is integrated with Coinbase and Abra. You can view gains for free. No masking of data. Also, you can reach out to their customer support easily via chatbox if needed.

Generally, it should be able to match the transfers between exchanges too. Reach out to their support via chatbox on the website and they should be able to figure out what's happening and might be able to provide a trace of funds (and could explain why it's right or wrong).

If you are just buying Bitcoin and not selling or trading for another currency, then there is no taxable event. 
Transferring to and from exchanges to a wallet (which you own) is not a taxable event. 
Gains on Bitcoin bought earlier than 12 months is definitely going to be a long term gain and less than 12 months would be short term.
When you put your transactions into any taxation software or FIFO algorithm after you sell the whole chunk, it is going to do a FIFO match and provide you in decimals up to 8 places showing which part is short term and which part is a long term gain.

He should be calculating his tax liability and then pay you the difference amount. Else, he might end up paying 30% of the gains.
Generally, he should show it as a gift from a friend, so that he will inherit your cost-basis (purchase price) and then calculate gains using tools like [BearTax]( Keep the 30% of the gain and pay you the difference.  
It's better for you to deal locally on peer-peer channels. 
Note: Not a financial advisor or a professional accounting advisor. Please consult with professionals for your decisions.

You can give [BearTax]( a try. You can upload transaction history for various years and it can provide your capital gains or losses based on your cost basis and sold price. You can choose the tax year on the top right corner to see the gains for each year. The good part is you can do all this for free. You pay only when you see the numbers and to download tax documents (IRS 8949 form) or an export file to TurboTax online.

I have been using [BearTax]( for last 2 years. They let you calculate and view your gain loss summary without asking or masking the values for money upfront. Worked for me as it is integrated with most of the major exchanges via API and can export to favorite tax filing software.

I've deleted it, especially it had comments suggesting people against paying taxes and going against the government. Didn't want to engage in arguments on what's right and what's wrong. We have been helping people who are willing to be compliant and trying to hustle through the trades they did and trying to figure out what's their liability. I think there's nothing wrong as I did it legitimately to help everyone who has postponed their taxes and doing it the last minute.

Awesome! Don't need to uninstall and install every time.
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:43:21
Yes, you are free to use multiple methods - but needs to be consistent. 
Don't forget that Crypto doesn't have clear guidelines yet - so safest bet would be FIFO. 
Consult a CPA to get reliable suggestions. 
To consolidate and calculate gains for above-mentioned transactions - use free tools such as [BearTax](

It is taxable only if sold. 
But you might need to report your holdings and it varies from case to case. Sometimes, if you are holding in exchanges abroad - it may also need you to declare a FBAR document.

Coinbase seems to have updated their developer agreement and requires you to accept it before letting anyone use your application. As a result, your application could have been disabled under "API Access" section of your profile.
