That's why you're a fool, fool.
@_date: 2018-05-14 11:43:50
It won't. No. No.

Peter Van Valkenburgh is utterly deluded. Contradicts himself on almost every point,  cherry picking weak evidence to support his arguments, absolutely clueless. Bitcoin has no chance to survive and if he is the pro-voice of bitcoin it has less than zero chance.
@_date: 2018-10-19 03:57:06
He's trying to protect and streamline his business, not begin using cumbersome payment methods. Cash, it works perfectly well - no fees, no time wasted.
@_date: 2018-06-11 15:01:38
Cyberintrusion?? It's a hack!! Crypto is so shit, get hacked pretend nothing happened lose all your money.
@_date: 2018-06-21 05:57:56
And how many coins lost due to fat fingers, sending to wrong address, losing passwords, private keys etc?  Bitcoin is way way down on the count.
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:30:47
Bitcoin will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever be the world's reserve currency.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:26:24
Not before heading towards 3k
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:12:13
Trustless future
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:55:26
The tech is old and shit
@_date: 2018-06-27 02:03:03
Ha! apart from a few days in 2013, it has only broke above 1000 last year. Nevertheless the concept of bitcoin works at those levels. It doesn't need to be 10k, 100k, 200k etc. Those are fantasies
@_date: 2018-06-26 07:08:43
It's not happening. There's no security, there are no regulations, institutions already have global reach in all markets. They don't need crypto or blockchain. The world doesn't need crypto or blockchain. It will simply be very niche, there is no need for the price to be as high as it is. It works at USD 1.00 just as well as USD 1000.

Buy $100 of books, read them. Far better investment of your time and money.
@_date: 2018-06-19 04:27:38
Probably lose half your money quite soon
@_date: 2018-06-29 04:02:24
Delusions of grandeur.  No one's worried about it
@_date: 2018-06-27 07:58:09
Take their school fees, their college tuition and buy a bitcoin, tell them don't worry about studying or working, just hodl, trust no one, don't talk to strangers and in the future you'll be rich HAHAHAHAHA  
@_date: 2018-06-22 09:53:36
It's only a matter of time before you lose your coins, lose access to your coins, something happens to your coins. How many have already been lost?  It's a terrible store of value.
@_date: 2018-06-19 07:44:33
It won't. No impact.
It won't.
It won't.
Nothing will change.
@_date: 2018-06-24 17:57:11
The future, get with it hahaha
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:28:29
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:55:58
Ha! then miners will just shut down. Their loss
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:57:11
Pay your taxes!
@_date: 2018-06-13 08:13:45
Why don't you build it?
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:57:26
Not even close
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:56:35
Easy to throw out 12k 16k 20k 100k   they don't mean anything.  Not easy to admit when it's going lower and lower. And right now it's going towards 3k
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:11:40
The whitepapers are full of incoherent garbage, unworkable ideas and pure fluff just to get to ICO and enrich the creator. You could create something actually intelligent, useful and workable of which there is nothing right now.
@_date: 2018-06-11 14:59:42
Hacking not a big deal? You're so fucking deluded
@_date: 2018-06-04 02:45:08
What were you thinking? They didn't need a fraction of a second, sounds like they could take their time and had fun too haha
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:45:43
Main stream adoption will never happen.
@_date: 2018-03-21 09:33:20
@_date: 2018-03-14 05:34:36
Mass adoption will simply never happen. It will be a disaster.
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:22:50
Finally game over for crypto and people are realising that. Cashing in while they still have something. Eventually it will be $0.
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:57:19
It's already happened.
Do a fork or create a new BS coin.  Limited supply HA!
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:07:47
Stop trying to bankrupt businesses by accepting your BTC. If BTC is so amazing why aren't consumers asking in the first place? It wouldn't need you spamming them.
Maybe they already realise mass adoption won't happen. There's no demand for it. They don't want to pay an additional tax burden. All because you bought some useless digi tokens.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:36:24
It's not FUD, it's the truth catching up with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:39:24

There will be no moon. Go back to watching tv and staring at your phone.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:28:40
It will certainly break 6000
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:11:10
Bitfinex.. no wonder, probably stole your money. Terrible website
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:54:47
You can't complain about no oversight just because it's not in your favour. Stop crying and suck up your losses
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:21:09
Needs all sorts and opinions to make a market, I have no qualms about my views. It's even funnier when you're told to FUD off instead of having an open discussion
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:47:26
Wow. This is funny!!
@_date: 2018-03-14 05:07:32
Mass adoption soon to bankrupt everyone who makes a mistake
@_date: 2018-03-16 09:20:22
If you can't take a small loss, you'll soon suffer the mother of all losses.
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:55:34
Certainly Tether
@_date: 2018-03-09 08:44:46
If you're all never selling, why are you here? Surely you'd simply ignore everything and get on with your life while waiting for your supposed moon. What am I missing?
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:05:43
Wah wah wah... it's not FUD, it's reality catching up with moon lambo crypto BS
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:16:08
Not everyone! It will be down there and even further, can't wait!
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:39:31
People finally realising they are hodling nothing so better cash out before it really becomes worthless nothing too. Never going to see new ATH again. CryptoHAHA
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:40:04
Ah before April, sure let's see. 
In the same spirit of not caring about breaking news, timing won't matter either and believe it will break lower sooner or later.
@_date: 2018-07-02 23:51:29

If even 1 satoshi is ever moved from his wallet, it is going to crash immediately. He is not your saviour.
@_date: 2018-07-05 05:30:26
Transaction Fees
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:09:10
Spoiling your moon? It's funny watching this though
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:59:30
Well I buy flights and hotels multiple times per year, make online purchases. Don't have this problem, don't need bitcoin. Use my credit card, have credit card protection, pay off the credit card at the each month. I can't see the problem. I guess, only a guess, there are better service providers out there
@_date: 2018-07-11 09:36:33
REKT gon' give it to ya
@_date: 2018-07-10 06:12:42
Going back to the middle ages, yay!  This stuff will never catch on
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:20:19
Ignorance thinking people actually want bitcoin. No one wants or needs it, it will never achieve mass adoption.
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:51:42
Read the T&amp;C before you buy. DYOR
@_date: 2018-07-06 13:24:25
Bit late to start thinking about risk management
@_date: 2018-07-02 11:26:43
No chance
