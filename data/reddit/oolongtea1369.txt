I don't understand the part to replace ISPs. How do you decentralizing/seeding anything with no Internet connection?

Hong Kong people are way too conservative to accept Bitcoin. Exchange might take advantage to bypass the China BTC restrictions tho.

This move/request is so immature, we are the one who are trying to sell Bitcoin to the world, boycotting whoever is not agreeing with us is like a child play, Apple won't be hurt from it, but WE will.

How? I mean, in practice, how do you transmit/receive data without passing through copper/fibre wirings in underground. Radio/3G/LTE spectrum require licenses, WiFi/Bluetooth are too weak to broadcast.
If you can't dump ISP, you are essentially creating another Tor network.

I always wondered the guy who operates the transaction, how many times did he double-checked if the address is correct.

Sorry new to here, but if this guy had a history of fraud in IT, why would anyone trust Mt.Gox at the very beginning?

HA! All those government officials are doing nothing and waiting for their terms to end, once ended, they can be promoted and work in the China government (like being a NPCSC at least). Against mainland taking over? That's the people's wish, not those policy makers.
