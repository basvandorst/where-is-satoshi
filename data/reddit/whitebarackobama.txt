I was just using $100 as a theoretical number. Thank you for your help.

Not necessarily, while we would all like for this to happen bitcoin is still not used as a currency. People right now are all hoping on the train mainly as an investment with hopes that that happens one day. I will consider bitcoin a viable currency when I can pick any town in America or any other nation for that matter and be able to buy everything I need to live like food, water, hotel ect. The growth of bitcoin is not definite proof the dollar is falling.

Uhh I dont completely understand what you are saying, is it a physical coin or what we call a "paper wallet" (a piece of paper with two QR codes and lots of random numbers)

No one knows what the value will be if bitcoin continues to keep gaining momentum. That probally the *projected* value. Id bet it would be a hell of a lot more. Some people were saying we hit the moon when bitcoin hit $1,000 USD. Thats nothing, were barely off the launch pad.

Even though I hold a solid amount of bitcoins I am most defiantly more excited to see that gif than the price to hit $1,000. Its pure ecstasy seeing that gif whatever it may be

Yes, that is the general idea. 
First you need to make sure that the computer you use is not "compromised" as in viruses or key loggers that steal your private address and subsequently your bitcoins. You either need to install Ubuntu or a fresh wipe of windows to a computer to be sure that the computer is not compromised. Then import  to the computer and generate some paper wallets.
On the paper wallet there are two codes one of these codes is your Public Address, this address used for people to send you bitcoins. The other is your private address **DO NOT SHARE THIS ADDRESS WITH ANYONE**. This address is used for you to send bitcoins to others. Once you send some bitcoins you need to move all the bitcoins out of that wallet to a new not compromised wallet because the old wallet is now compromised. 
If you loose this piece of paper at all then you are screwed, there is no way to get the bitcoins back. Thus make multiple copies and put them in multiple places. 
If I didnt explain this well enough remember [The internet is your friend!](

Part of what makes bitcoin desirable is the fact that you dont have to deal with anything physical. Bitcoin takes a step forward in abolishing physical money, your idea would just be taking one step backwards.

I am 17 and a junior in highschool and a proud holder of 15.6 BTC. I am absolutely obsessed with bitcoin for two main reasons.
1) I have made $10,000 in under a month doing absolutely nothing
2) The power and potential the bitcoin network holds, its intoxicating how easy it is to send and receive bitcoins. I see it holding huge promise in the future, world changing if anything.
I have urged my friends to put some money into bitcoins but they all think the same "Oh its a ponzi scheme", "Its just a bubble" so on and so on. I soon will be doing some online shopping with bitcoins and have a wallet set up for if I ever run into an actual store that accepts bitcoins. I do not care what they sell, they will be getting my business.

I dont know about you but I have pondered what would happen if the US government attempts to make Bitcoins illegal 
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:42:31
November 5th I bought 10 bitcoins for $2,968 then on November 23 I bought 5.5 bitcoins for $3,507 and sometime later bought 0.1 for like $90 for a total of 15.6 bitcoins for $6,565. Currently 1 bitcoin is valued at $1,136 on Coinbase so this means my 15.6 bitcoins are worth $17,721 if you subtract my original investment of $6,565 I have made $11,156. 
"I have made" was not the correct phrase to use, I should have said my investment has appreciated overtime to come to a value over $10,000 more than my original investment seeing how I have yet to cash out and I don't plan on doing that ever.

Different markets have different prices, it is the exact same idea as different gas stations selling gas at different prices. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:06:04
I believe that there is not only a need for bitcoin but also the way it is set up that it will succeed so in a sense I have already cashed out, my fiat. I dont plan on going back, hell or high-water.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:25:41
I woke up this morning, went to school and checked the price it was around $625, and it just hit $900 on mtgox about 10 mins ago.

While I am under 18 I easily appear to be somewhere in my mid 25s, as a freshman in high chool I was asked where I got my degree, and bought beer the other weekend. Granted that store was a little sketchy and no shave november is in full swing but non the less. 
My scheme is to buy lets say 1 bitcoin from coinbase for $100, sell it on localbitcoins for $113.50 a 13.5% profit for me and subsequently buy more bitcoins. I seem to be the only person in my area that is selling, the next closer seller is like &gt; 20 miles away.

Let me rub my magic crystal ball...
Just think of this as a fire sale 
@_date: 2013-12-05 05:03:41
I already have cashed out, my fiat that is. Bitcoin is the future, or at least thats what I think. I could be wrong, I could be right and if it fails in the end then I had fun while I had no actual obligations such as rent, car payments or children.

So on the Namecoin DNS network namecoins and only namecoins can be used? 
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:16:56
I thought I missed the rocketship when I bought 10 bitcoins for $296 per. So no you have not missed it at all, you still are within the 3% or so of people on the world who actually know what a bitcoin is

No worries, unless the hacker has the will to break into my parents security box to steal my BIB38 encrypted paper wallet generated on an offline laptop with a fresh install Ubuntu I dont think I have much to worry about. 
I even turned off my router durring the paper wallet creation 
I ^take^things^to^far^often     
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:33:02
Via USB for bitadress, although I just saved the webpage and imported Firefox to my offline computer. Is that bad at all?
No updates or connect to the internet for windows, I actually turned off my router to be double sure.
I found Ubuntu to be semi tricky for me, I like to think I have a relatively good grasp on technology and computers but that seemed a little out of my ballpark. They both accomplish the same thing right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:45:06
No system is perfect. I agree that we probably will never see under $100, hell probably even $300 
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:13:09
This is very helpful, thank you. Do you send the bitcoins through your localbitcoins wallet or do you use something else? I think you have to in order to gain good review right?
Also when do you "Lock in" the price they will pay per bitcoin? When they contact you or during the the meeting?
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:13:37
Thank you, will take this into account

Yeah I bought in two weeks ago at $296 UDS per coin, I bought 10 coins. I thought that I missed out and wasn't going to make to much money. I had no clue it was going to double and at one point triple its value. When it did I bought 5.5 more coins for like $3500 on tuesday. I remember when I was looking at bitcoin when it was $80 UDS, damn I wish I could have jumped on the train then.

I value my anonymity just as much as I possibly can. This computer that is password protected along with a non auto reddit login never leaves my room and no one else is allowed on. I have deleted my account multiple times simply just on the thought that one of my friends could have figured it out, without tangible proof. Chances are within the next 2-3 weeks this account will be gone even though I thoroughly enjoy the username.  
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:59:52
I still dont really understand namecoin? From what I have learned when you buy namecoin your buying .bit addresses? Everyone I have talked to about it seems to be really into it, more than bitcoin but I just cant grasp it.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:54:24
While I have never been a day trader everything I have heard from day traders has been negative. I would not recommend that.
Multiple wallets are a good idea but please tell me that you are creating the addresses through a safe way such as Ubuntu or fresh install of windows. Trust NO ONE, not even your own computer, shut down your router, TRUST NO ONE. Lastly on your long term wallets I would recommend a Bip38 encryption that you keep in multiple places other than the safe you keep them in. 
My suggestion would be get your funds in a safe place and sit back and enjoy the roller coaster ride to the moon with us.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:48:50

Looks interesting, neat concept. For some reason when I first downloaded the cycle logo would only bounce on my doc (I have a macbook), it eventually fixed itself though.

I did my research, these are going into a paper wallet and then into my security box at my bank. Im planning on holding onto these for a long time
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:15:11
Interesting, I have never seen statistics like this before. There are thousands of other factors that play a role in the value of the US dollar other than these ones provided, its still hard for me to believe that a still minuscule currency's slight growth can be considered hard evidence that the dollar is falling. While there may be a correlation between the two I do not believe that at this point it is hard evidence. When bitcoin hits somewhere around $20,000 US and the dollar continues to fall then it in my mind then can be considered hard proof. Bitcoin in my opinion is still far to small to be making this claim.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:52:04
I disagree with what is saying. 
Rent a security box at your local bank, and buy a laptop. Use that laptop to make a paper wallet with Ubuntu and subsequently place that into the security box. What happens if the computer gets dropped or damaged leading to failure of the hardrive? Not to mention any hardrive can fail at anytime for any reason. The security box is water and fireproof along and insured (I think)

I was getting my coinbase account verified when bitcoin was at $220 per coin, by the time I was able to buy it was at $290. I was pissed, almost didnt buy 10 coins. 
So no you are not to late, Id guess bitcoin will be over $1,000 USD before christmas
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:57:32
No worries, I refuse to tell anyone I know in person how many bitcoins I own or the price I paid for them. I learned this through my very profitable summer job of caddying, once people learn of the money I make they fundamentally treat me differently such as "Oh you can afford paying for this for me" or attempt to befriend me for my wealth. Maybe its just because were all 16 or 17 and their actions just pass straight over their heads, maybe not who knows. I don't even tell my parents how much I make/earn at this point. As for anyone finding my account I greatly value my internet anonymity and have deleted my account multiple times just with the thought that one of my friends could have discovered it, without any tangible proof. Otherwise no way in hell I would have posted this, or anything else on my account.
As for me being ripped off, my coins are all in cold storage in my parents security box at the bank. They can only get into it and I don't believe they would ever steal that from me. They cant really even grasp the idea of a virtual currency, but I will continue trying to educate them and hopefully covert them. 
But overall I am not worried about boasting my bitcoin success anonymously over the internet to a random bitcoin community. On the other hand anyone I know in person? Fuck no. 
Edit: Sorry if I jacked your thread OP, this wasn't my intent with the my comment.

Yeah, I am thinking about buying some Tesla stock for the long run also. At least from what I have learned that money through investing is made over time. The more time you have before you cash out in a successful business the better and I have a hell of a lot of time left in my life. Not to mention that I am very young, I have no real world responsibilities such as paying bills, the best time for me to invest is now while I do not have such things.

If this is true and you are not a troll this is what you are going to want to do
The first 8 characters of the public address are on each coin, which allows you to obtain the full address or check the balance at FirstBits or a similar service. Beneath the tamper-evident holographic sticker on each coin is the private address which corresponds to the public address. Once you've obtained both the public and private address, the process for importing this information into an existing wallet has already been documented in this prior question.
It is totally possible this coin has already been redeemed and valueless, please keep us updated
edit: Before I get downvoted to oblivion, I copy and pasted that passage from another website. While I believe it is correct "firstbits" seems to no longer be a company to my research. I am not an expert on this, if anyone else can help feel free.  
Edit 2: Turns out freebits is currently still alive [here]( Enter that 8 character code into that and it should give you a code with 24 characters.
