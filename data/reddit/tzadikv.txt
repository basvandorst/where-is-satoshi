I emailed WNYC about it.  I encourage others to do the same

Says the person who is just fine with the status quo of poor people paying $2000 a year in extra fees (check cashing, money orders, etc) because they don't have bank accounts. I'm greedy but people who charge a 10% check cashing fee to the poorest people are not greedy at all
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:39:52
Who the freak cares if the company is reputable?  You are getting donations you wouldn't otherwise get and cashing out every day!  What is the "risk" he's avoiding?  The whole thing makes no sense.  Is WNYC some special case that coinbase and bitPay never anticipated?

Hmmm... it seems this change address of mine has been around for a while... maybe it's someone sending me money for some other reason?
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:53:20
I just randomly received 2 payments to the change address used on those 2 transactions (18sCetKLHbuvgWDw2BA4RWv8gvtpG7HWtR) and I'm not sure if that was indended as a tip for me or if someone was trying to give to the people I gave Matanos L'Evyonim to.  Please post a message signed using the address you used to send it to me if you want it sent on to those people instead of me keeping it.

Does BTC have any advantage in online shopping over buying a gift card or prepaid debit card?
@_date: 2014-12-23 15:24:59
I don't see the problem, as long as you specify that it has an expiration date.  Many things you could give have an expiration date, such as fresh fruit or concert tickets.  If they are aware of the date and don't use it by then, they are pretty likely never going to.  Whatever tackiness there is is not as bad as waste.  If you want to minimize tackiness, then specify that after it expires it will go to charity "in their name".  If you pick an obnoxious enough charity, that just might be what it takes to motivate them to use it.  I don't agree about not giving bitcoin for evangelizing... I gave a paper wallet at a secret Santa last year and the recipient ended up not only importing the wallet but buying more on his own, and he had never used bitcoin before.

Any way to get in touch with blockchain.info?
@_date: 2014-03-16 17:29:40
OK, but what would be most useful to them?  Should I recommend cashintocoins.com as a way to buy BTC?  Or localbitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:57:29
It may be fixed but that does not help the people who got their wallets emptied.  I would really like to hear what Google plans to do to prevent this from hapenning again.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:47:55
Well I also did the website for them :)
@_date: 2014-03-20 04:08:58
I got a similar text (that BTC was sent from my wallet... it did not use the word "stolen"... did you really get a text that said "stolen"?), but upon looking at it further, it was referring to a transaction I myself made about a week ago.  It could be that the text was never sent about that transaction at the time and for some reason it's being sent this late.  Or perhaps old texts that were sent are being resent.  Definitely a bug of some sort but it doesn't seem serious.  Check to see if what you received refers to an old (but legitimate) transaction.

@_date: 2014-03-16 19:19:26
You're right. It's better to have all your assets in a currency that loses about 3% every year than one that tends to go up in value an order of magnitude each year because a certain loss is better than "volatility". And it's also better to be at constant risk of having your life savings wiped out by any burglar who can get through your window. And it's better to have to pay middlemen a large fee every time you want to move that money to someone that's not right next to you

I emailed the Red Cross about why bitcoin is not mentioned anywhere on their site and got this reply:
"Thank you for contacting the American Red Cross for information about making a financial donation. At this time, we are website (sic) is not set up to take bitcoin donations. There maybe (sic) other companies that have special donation programs available."

Although I took down BitPay integration and any mention of Bitcoin on the site, you can still use the original address I had set up before integrating BitPay... 1HeartjYaFjtN1w6evEoXSM9JMQbY1BLqT  .   The "1Heart" vanity prefix alludes to the English translation of the title of our weekly newsletter.

There is no "password".  Just print out a paper wallet (e.g. from  and they scan the private key.

Why did you buy bitcoin in the most complicated possible way?  I don't have to leave my computer to buy them with coinbase.
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:07:42
It didn't take me any time to be aproved on coinbase or him either.  You give them your online banking login and password and they aprove you right away.  He did figure out it was me that gave the paper wallet and asked me what site  I recommended for buying bitcoin.  It's kind of agravating that you're suggesting this is not real.  I have a video of him opening it if you want.  As I said, he had HEARD of bitcoin previously but had never bought any.  He was mainly puzzled by what exactly the paper wallet was.
@_date: 2013-08-23 03:39:03
Of course it knows the private key... it just doesn't store it in your online wallet (for security).  This works the same as you described... generate random private key, apply function to produce corresponding public key / address.  Instead of putting both private key and address in the wallet (like the Satoshi client would do), it just puts the address in the wallet (so the software can watch the network and keep track of the transactions and balance) and the private key in the offline wallet.

We now have a new vanity address: 1HeartjYaFjtN1w6evEoXSM9JMQbY1BLqT .  The "1Heart" refers to the title of our weekly bulletin "Lev Echad (One Heart)"
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:35:39
I see your point but if it's a reputable site like coinbase, you assume they aren't going to abuse it.  Most probably they don't store it in any database... they just see if it lets them login and accept that as proof that you're the real owner of the account.  But one idea if you're nervous is, login to your bank, change the password to something temporary, then give that temporary password to coinbase.  Once coinbase accepts you, change your bank password back.

The owner did NOT know the customers!  The Baltimore bitcoin meetup just decided to hold their meeting there.  Granted, they do not have a POS hardware there, just a printout of a QR code so they have to trust what it says on the customer's device.  When we were there, the owner had a laptop off to the side running a desktop bitcoin client, and he could see the transactions there. He says that if he gets more bitcoin business, he'll set up a POS device.

I did the same thing and it was well recieved: 
If you're nervous about him throwing it out, keep the private key and write on the paper wallet that it must be redeemed (moved out of the wallet) within say 30 days.  If it's still there, you can take it back (maybe give him a warning first)
