There are some BTC sellers on LBC in Providence, I have completed a few transactions without any issues. LesbianCow was her username I think.

They got hacked and lost a bunch of coins not too long ago, that's why. You can always check localbitcoins.com to see if individuals are selling close to you. Most of the time you pay a little bit of a premium but it's worth it because you get your coins within minutes.

There's a decent amount of food trucks in Providence now, I don't think any accept BTC yet though.

Instead of rambling off topic why don't you address why you think there would be no consequences in anarchy, because while that little spiel you had there is nice and all it doesn't relate to the topic at hand in anyway.

No consequences in anarchy? Sounds like you haven't done much research on anarchy if you came to that conclusion. Why don't you start with this video and I can provide you with more detailed information if you're actually interested.

I'm at work right now, I'll throw together the FOIA when I get home in 4 hrs or so if no one else has. DHS will probably just tell us to kick rocks of the investigation is still on going.

Cato putting out an article that isn't absolute trash? Color me surprised.
