Yeah I get that but I don't want to send someone a thousand bucks in hopes that he won't screw me over. There should be some 'buffer' or a safeguard for this

You seem like nice people and I congratulate you on your accomplishment. How can I get in? Yes I've read the FAQ on the main page, I've made a wallet and went through several websites listed there as trading, but for the life of me I can't understand they was I can *securely* buy btc. 
Like, Localbitcoins is a bunch of god-knows-who (companies? people?) and their description mostly goes like 'well you send me the money and then I'll send you btc'. How is that secure? 
And bigger sites like coinbase don't work in my country (which is strange to me, what's the difference where on the globe I am since I have a credit card that works wherever), so what do I do? How can I trust basically a personal ad on localbitcoins?
