How is bitcoin? HS is fine
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:14:41
haha, in one week you will cry a lot for not having sold at 12k, depending on your investment you will have a degree of suicidal tendance
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:24:42
oh bitcoin just goes too high without decent correction, it's bad it doesn't happen. People buy bitcoin whenever it's about to drop they sell and then they buy cheaper more than they had before
again and again.Also leverage trading at exchanges. I also said in my post that it is overbought on RSI. Nobody that's smart is going to invest a lot of money in bitcoin when it's 16k so it would mean that it would have to get down first to get up again. I don't say btc cannot go to 100k but before that it will have to get down at some point first. And the fact about NN also tells my mind US will ban crypto's because it's decentralised and bcs they don't like it.

Who gives a F about grammar trading is about analytical performance, I have shit brain for grammer though i speak 4 languages but damn my analytical brain is highly on point and it's telling me bch is going to take over market cap of bitcoin within a month
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:22:02
btc is a speculative thing that is traded day and night, i think u don't really realize how it has gotten it's value. And the fact that it is traded 24/7 means it can get out of hand quickly
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:39:38
No reason? u don't now it's centralised now by the banks/wall street?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:17:45
Now that there are futures on bitcoin it's centralised. Don't be a fool and think that wall street cannot game bitcoin, they make money out of nothing, they are strategists and find bitcoin a danger so they will kill it. Look how bitcoin is doing, yes there are corrections always but this on is not how the real bitcoin behaves IMO.
And look how bch is going, there's a reason behind it. Don't be a fanatic fool

the vote has been done already months ago haha u think money is going to let it vote justified? With president trump? forget it
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:14:40
I asked u something twat! how is bitcoin? and i'm at college btw
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:04
spend more time in the ecosystem?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:27:24
Does no one realise bitcoin drops because of futures?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:52:16
bitcoin has gotten other "value" it's used to purchase altcoins, this can easily change when wall street gets next week on bitcoin and shorts it because take it how u want but the fed and ecb they can choose how much money they short into bitcoin because they control the money. Doesn't matter how high the market cap is, also btc rsi is 98 which is higly overbought. I'm not saying btc can't go to 100k but atm it has a very low chance to go much higher.
Also FCC net neutrality has gone through, it would not be a suprise to me if with the vote btc is going to die, they(trump) will have soon the ability to block every site they want, if they don't like bitcoin, bye bye.
There is however still a chance to be survived, the substratum coin(blockchain) is going to fix this problem so if bitcoin becomes illegal it will still be accessible with substratum, so maybe change btc into substratum(just a idea).

Retarded comment, check back in 2 days and let's discuss who's the alpha dogg
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:20:21
I don't think it's fully the reason why bitcoin cash exists. 
You even should be gratefull for bch to exist now that wall street has the force to take bitcoin down, bch and others (etherium, litcoin?) will rise. They will have to ban crypto's if they want to get rid of it.
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:00:34
no it's not omg all u guys around here don't know shit about trading
@_date: 2017-11-04 08:57:18
it didn't
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:32:00
you are the noob, btc goes to 6k and then it might go lower
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:50:42
only long btc mkey never short btc mkey
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:04:17
i speak 5 languages and idfc about grammar it's for stupid people who think they are smart while they limit theirselves to one language how many languages do u speak?
Also ur the stupid one look to the chart btc is falling
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:19:23
looks like a start of a pullback, i'm not saying it will go to 5k, 6k would already be a lot, I'm thinking about something like 6.8, maybe 6.5
So what ur saying is btc only goes up and will hit 20k on Christmas?
Or when u think next pullback will be after segwitx2?
I'm only trying to get opinions not some breakdowns from the btc-believers.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:02:20
i was going to post in case you didn't know, people buy more bitcoin leveraged with the revenue of their past bitcoin gains so it's a bubble mechanism prob only 3% of btc's value is not lended and real asset like purchased.
Once when btc goes low stop losses get activated and boom. it doesn't nesc has to be so but always keep in mind the higher it bounces the lower it can get there have been multiple bubbles into the past and bitcoin has a possibilty to be one that pops which doesn't mean it will do so
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:27:39
haha people that just don't know shit about trading..
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:34:56
i have -14 karma for telling the truth, i told one week ago btc was going to go down to 6k and i was right
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:02:33
Bitcoin is all and all a bubble, it has no real value.
The fact that it is very easy hedge funable makes it only more a bubble.
Btc was invented bcs the FED has a very bad way of lending money, but btc profits from the same system why it was invented (stock market crash 2007)
btc can go up to 10k by the end of the year yes but at some point it will crash harder than it went up, if u don't know this u know nothing about economics.
Only if there is no more money printing, btc can have a stable value, even then it won't. Bcs btc is to volatile it can never be used as a currency, only for retards. 
The only reason btc is going up is bcs it has limited supply, to much money printing by ecb and fed, hedge funds, the trend. 
If you really want something 'scare' of value. Buy oil or solar power.
if u look at how those prices are then it's clearly how stupid btc is and that it's a fucking joke. (but yh u can get rich of it if ur the smart one)
in 20 years on barrel oil will be 100 times more of value than one single btc
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:56:10
u clearly do not read the charts, i do and that's why i'm wondering
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:12:19
information, haha look at the chart u can see it for yourself or your either way to stupid and euphoria.
90% of btc is in possesion of 3% of holders and trust me they don't care if it goes to 9k or 5k it's all the same for them. The price has been going up a lot lately a strong correction to 5k is not unreliable, the higher it grows the stronger it will crash.
The price is now stabelizing after a big grow which is a sign of a potential pullback.
Haha one day the smart guys are going to walk away with money of stupid guys like u bcs btc is worth shit.
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:44:57
u think that augmentation will be continu? I'm looking for the perfect buy moment to hedge fund with low money into a lot of btcs. That's why i posted this
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:52:12
btc technology is pure shite, it's so bad. it's only value is there because it's used to buy altcoins and because the trend has been gone upward. As soon as smart money leaves bitcoin crashes and all the money goes to the smart people happened some times before why would it be different?
However the supply of btc can have it's role in staying up but the recent chart screams bubble
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:31:37
untill btc crashes and you didn't cashed out
@_date: 2017-11-04 11:31:27
You clearly are the dumbass, oil is bad investment, oil is needed for everything and it's supply is limited, the pc u use to write ur dumbass comment is made of oil, everything, your car. U think the whole world is gonna drive cars on green power or nuclear material? haha that's stupid oil is also needed for plastic, actually for everything u buy in the shop. 
U talk about space city's man u have to be really stupid to think space is the future
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:23:10
Seems like u guys are not aware of the hausse btc had the last 2 weeks and how that can potentially go from 15% to 10
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:50:23
I'm sorry for the tittle, but that's just clickbaiting ^^ 
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:49:03
thanks for clarifying it up for me, it's what I thought but I wasn't sure
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:43:52
@_date: 2017-06-18 19:31:07
That's not what I'm saying, I'm trying to get information/ insight/ opinions.
Not stupid comments from guys like u with a smart ass comment while you actually look like a silly nerd
