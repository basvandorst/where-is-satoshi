I work for a hedge fund, so I actually know what naked shorting is, and I actually understand the gravity of Byrne's claims. No one naked shorted Overstock.com's stock, and Byrne is an idiot for claiming that they did. 
With that said, do YOU actually understand what he's claiming? If you do you'd know how fucking ridiculous it is on its face.

Just so you guys know, Byrne is a nutty asshole. Here is a link that talks about how he hired a "pretexting" specialist to gain access to people's facebook profiles in order to publish conspiracy theories about them: 
Here's one of my favorites, courtesy of CNBC:


He's been labelled "America's Nastiest CEO" for good reason. This is not the type of guy you guys want associated with your PR image...

Hahaha okay man, I'm sure that's why he hacked people's facebook accounts.

Wow, that article is absolute shit. I guess I shouldn't be surprised though, seeing as it admittedly is mostly composed of the work of  group lead by "The Easter Bunny" and other (even the author admits) nutjobs. This shit is just like the 9/11 "The government did it" theories, with just enough evidence and appeals to authority that it could fool someone who already wanted to believe Wall Street was evil. I'm not going to write a takedown of a 40,000 word article, so you can continue saying that I've "provided no evidence", and I don't really care. You can believe what you want and that's fine with me.

Holy shit man, you need to get real. I strongly encourage you to actually go and look up what he's claiming went on. It didn't happen, and he's either paranoid or running a PR scam just like Allied Capital did.

He gambled in the stock market with his wife's money and lost it all. He's a compulsive gambler and I think he is probably got some mental health issues.

Hello guys, I'm the moderator that responded to these comments. I figured I'd come in and clear the air / set the record straight a bit.
So after looking at the modmail, it seems that I've made a mistake. We were messaged by two users with similar names at around the same time, and I thought that they were the same person. I responded to OP here as though I had already told them what to do to get their link approved, but I had actually told someone else. 
Here is a screenshot of both conversations so that you can judge, in context, for yourselves:
I apologize to OP, this should have been explained much more clearly. 
To clarify, we do not have a policy against bitcoin. We have specific rules about asking for advice (which the first thread violated), and, after a huge uproar about links, we're very selective about which ones we let through. 
The otcmarkets website was automatically caught in our spam filter, and I believed that the OP had added the second bitcoin link after I'd already told them to remove the links in general, leading to my curt remark about not encouraging that type of post.
To help you guys understand my state of mind a bit, I have to remove something like 10 posts per day for rule violations, so sometimes I jump the gun a bit. Today I've also been awake for far longer than I should have been, so I was also only half-there and pretty cranky. 
Once again, I'm sorry for the curt comments and the mistaken removal.
EDIT: By the way OP, I've unbanned you. No harm no foul.

Do you consider bitcoin a currency? Most people in the investment world do not consider currencies an investment.
