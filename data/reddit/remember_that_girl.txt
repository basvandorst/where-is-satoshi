Thank the US government that imposes heavy fines on banks for enabling money laundering. That's the sole reason why they close your accounts.

Dude. They moderate what's being reported by users.

Who wants to bet it will never recover?

Great to get distracted from work with a Reddit notification and read a quality shitpost.

No. If you're poor, the most efficient investment that you can make is putting money under your mattress (if you own one) until you have enough for emergency reserves, let's say six months spending amount.
If losing $300 is a lot for you, next time put this money into a piggy bank.
I lost $1000 since December but that's just my toy money and I have zero regrets.
If you're poor, a chance of earning $1000 is not as important as a chance of losing $1000. You cannot risk that money, even if you have a chance to earn profit.

You will receive a return on your capital when life gets tough you can use your emergency savings instead of a high interest loan.
Building capital to avoid payment of interest is, essentially, a sort of investment too.

The bill (not a law) makes it absoliutely clear that cryptocurrency is not legal tender. It is very explicit about it.

Building capital to avoid payment of interest is, essentially, a sort of investment too. Actually gives better returns than stocks in the bull market.

It is not a problem for all the other exchanges? DSX/epayments, Lykke, Coinbase etc.

Well, Lykke Exchange used to have 0% fee for credit cards, but they abruptly declared an end to it. It was nice never having to pay my credit card bill (credit card =&gt; lykke =&gt; btc =&gt; localbitcoins =&gt; cash).
Let's wait for another sucker who is willing to hand out money for free.
