Still deserve an upvote, though! Lets pump the dumpsters (weak hands) out of this market so much they'll regret it for years.

It's important to notice that it took 30 years from the first PC before half of the population owned a PC. ��

Dude, people have been saying that for years. If you could go back in time and ask people about bitcoin, nobody would believe it would end up being pumped by trillions of dollars, breaking headlines and getting above the $10000 mark. Nobody, i mean nobody would ever have believed that. After Mt.gox everybody said like you and look where we are now!!! �� 
I bet you wouldnt even be able to find 100 people saying bitcoin would get above the $5 mark after having explained what bitcoin is.

If bitcoin never gets above 10k its because of dumpsters like you. Not teether, not BitConnect, not regulation or ban or Warren Buffet.

Stop saying you know where the market goes, nobody does. It depends on so many factors it's impossible to predict. It is a likely or plausible scenario, its not the same as if its actually going to happen. Stop misleading people, you could be wrong and lead people to bad decisions.

Depends on your investment.  If you invested your lifesaving in bitconnect then i'll be surprised if you can afford the slippers as of now.  ��

Yes, of course you can. Can I give you some advice? Remember that bitcoin is very volatile. Don't invest if you just sell when you see red. Most people lose their money, because they don't have the patience to wait or the skills of being a good trader. The best investeres can invest without any emotions. ��

Lets spread the fud, because spreading fud actually helps the community.

Stop spreading meaningless fud. Who cares if they sell some bitcoin. IT will not even effect the price since they are selling it on dark pools and not exchanges.

Just remember that bitcoin is much more volatile than stocks. It can easily change 5 % in a normal day and more than 15% on a good or bad day ��. I have bought bitcoin and ripple on bitpanda and i have never had any issues.
