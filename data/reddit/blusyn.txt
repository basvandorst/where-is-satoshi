Good analysis. I run a full node on dedicated hardware, so the calculation is much different. Though I think most full nodes are run through a VPS/cloud service, so it is an important consideration.
Also, most VPS services run entirely on SSDs for performance. This is why space is so expensive. (For comparison, a 1TB enterprise HDD is ~$80 vs $350+ for SSD)

I really like this proposal. I have a few concerns in terms of uptake, but I'm just happy someone actually made an official BIP.
I think this serves a nice compromise on 2 key issues:
1) It creates a single hard-fork with a reasonable short-term increase, and removes the need for future hard-forks (awesome).
2) It gives miners the consensus power on the growth of the network, as opposed to the developers deciding this arbitrarily.
My only concern is the 2x growth over 3 months might not be enough if there is a sudden and massive influx of Bitcoin traffic. But it's reasonable enough to allow for sustained growth, and predictable resource increases. I think this is a very fair compromise between the two sides.
Great work @_date: 2015-06-08 23:01:51
I agree it's possible to do in a few weeks. But that sort of "emergency hard fork" should be reserved for... emergencies? This is an issue we know about today and we can reasonably predict when and how it will occur. It's ridiculous because we can solve it now and have a **planned** fork in place months in advance. I just don't understand why you would want to wait until after the system breaks to deploy a fix (even a short-term fix).
I think you're forgetting that even 2-days of backlogged tx's could be a disaster for the bitcoin ecosystem. It would destroy confidence (especially investor confidence) in an extremely critical stage of Bitcoin growth. It's a very irresponsible thing to allow happen.
@_date: 2015-06-30 22:16:32
Miners decide which txs to include. In fact most exclude 0-fee currently.

I like the idea of giving miners ~~for~~  more choice! Interesting ideas.
It isn't clear what the incentive to miners is to include more txs. If they are penalized for going over a certain size, wouldn't they just always avoid doing so? In a large utxo-build-up scenario you'd want to encourage miners to clear the backlog up to a certain point. Unless the penalty cost is lower than the fees collected on those txs. I'm not clear on how this scenario would play out in a fee-pool system.

Agreed. Pieter seems pretty reasonable, and I've discussed this with him in person. We disagree on some details, but I think he's interested in finding a good balance.
Everything so far is pretty theoretical. I do hope maxwell or someone will actually put in an official BIP that can be directly discussed, rather than many wildly different counter proposals.
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:59:52
Not to belabor this point, but do you really think the growth and scale of the Bitcoin network should be decided by a select group of core devs? This seems dangerously centralized to me.
The capacity of the network should grow at whatever pace it is willing to grow. Neither you, I, nor Gavin should get to decide when and how it grows. I think you'd agree with that, but I haven't seen you provide any proposals to that effect. Now you're suggesting a hard-fork every time capacity limits are hit. That isn't a scaling solution. Even with Lightning network/payment channels/whatever, we will need to scale beyond the current capacity.
I like you Peter, and I apologize for singling you out. But I think everyone would be happier if you were active in providing the solutions instead of just pointing out the problems. Your unwillingness to compromise isn't a good way to build trust or consensus.

It's pretty bad. I have it good in SF, where I got a 120Mbit connection last year. Before that 50Mbit was the best available. 1Gbit fiber will be available in my neighborhood later this year. This is the best-case scenario for most of US, but upgrades are happening quickly. I think in 5 years 1Gbit fiber will be the norm in all large cities.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:57:08
Exactly. IMO the protocol itself shouldn't have a hard limit. The miners should set their soft limit to whatever makes sense to them. Most just keep it on the default soft limit anyway (750KB). So removing the hard limit wouldn't change much in the short-term.
Satoshi add the limit out of concern for a "bad miner" spamming the network with a giant block. This is no longer economical for a miner to do, and would be self-defeating in practice. Eg, said miner would need to artificially create 100k+ transactions, and then have enough hash power to mine that block, and send 100MB block to the network. This would be insanely expensive to do just for lulz. At most could happen only once or twice, and the network would recover very quickly.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:03:53
There's a difference between what is technically possible and what is realistically practical.
@_date: 2015-06-10 21:50:19
I'm a bit late to this thread, but it really made me think more. Here's my rough analysis.
I think the # of nodes will continue to drop regardless of block size, or other technical reasons. The drop is purely practical reasons. As you've said, average users are now using SPV wallets and don't need bitcoin-qt to manage their funds. Running nodes is increasingly a server admin-level job. Block size doesn't affect this, even if blocks were 100KB forever, there's no utility value in running your own node when using a mobile or hosted wallet.
Let's run the thought experiments for the different extreme proposals on both sides, fast forwarding 3+ years.
1) Block limit stays at 1MB. This allows for maximum network distribution with small overhead. For the sake of argument lets say we have LN, Payment Channels, etc all implemented. Average user is then not using Bitcoin network directly for transactions, and there's even less incentive for average user to run full nodes. More likely, most node operators are now running sidechain/lightning network/payment channel/SPV nodes. These are now far more valuable. At this point, since the core btc network is really only usable for large transfers (eg, &gt; $5 per tx fees), nodes will only be run by large institutions/companies (eg, centralized). I imagine this scenario could see the node network drop to &lt; 1000. So we've maximized the ability for the network to be decentralized, but removed any incentive for users to care about verifying the blockchain. After all, what average user cares what transactions banks and rich people are doing?
2) Block size hard limit is removed completely. Miners decide how big blocks want to be. Fees stay small, so average people can use to main network as much as they wish. Miners will still be slow with low-or-free transactions, after all they still pay for the bandwidth. But with high volume, they can still potentially make some profit off the fees + block rewards. Now let's say 1 million people are using the network directly, and block sizes are 100MB+ each. This is certainly more than most could manage on a home network. Indeed, probably 90% of current nodes would crumble in this situation. So running nodes becomes a niche to server-admins, companies, and large institutions (eg, centralized). I imagine this scenario could see the node network drop to &lt; 1000. However, we've maximized utility+value of the network, and there's still an incentive to care about verifying the blockchain (though most users wouldn't be able to).
It's a wash. The end result in terms of raw node-count is likely to be the same. "Centralization" of nodes is probably inevitable in either scenario. The question then becomes what the utility of Bitcoin should be. I think this is a much more interesting debate.
Note: If anyone thinks I've completely missed the mark in either scenario, please let me know.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:27:10
I would certainly prefer this not to happen. However, at some point somebody has to actually do something. Preferably before it's too late. If Gavin is the only one willing to actually make a decision, then so be it.
I would prefer to have broader agreement across the core devs. This seems very unlikely currently.

There are voices on the "other side" that want a real debate on how to increase block size responsibly. However, I think this point is lost because you have some loud voices on the "other side" saying some ridiculous things (eg, [Peter Todd saying a hard fork, once blocks fill up, "could be rolled out in a few weeks"]( Don't even get me started on the comments by Mircea Popescu.
I think people like Gavin and Maxwell, who are both incredibly intelligent, can probably come to a compromise. But to many here, it appears one side is actually doing in-depth analysis and engaging the issue head-on (eg, Gavin), and others are sticking their fingers in their ears and pretending this isn't even an issue we need to solve (eg, [Peter Todd](
I hate to single out Peter too much, as I respect him for his work. But he's lost respect of many recently because he can't seem to actually propose real solutions. (Lightning network isn't a solution, it's an alternative system).
Gavin has routinely shown willingness to compromise. People forget that Gavin's original proposal was to remove the hard-limit completely. The 20MB block size WAS the original compromise (now it appears he's hoping for 8MB?). Either way, one side appears to be digging it's feet deeper, and one appears to propose real solutions. It's hard for people not to be frustrated by that.
I agree the strawman arguments are really annoying, but I wouldn't say he is completely misrepresenting many on the "other side".
So to prevent further mis-representation of views, I'll ask directly.
What kind of compromise would you prefer to see?

If you want a direct comparison to fiat, I think 1 satoshi (smallest BTC denomination) should be roughly equal to 1 cent (smallest USD denomination). 
This would mean 1 full BTC would be equal to $1m USD in today's dollars.
However, I would prefer to use a direct economic comparison rather than a fiat comparison. This would require comparing BTC to the CPI (Consumer Price Index). Basing the value on it's direct purchasing power is much more useful.

The difference is orders under 10% are still locked to VIP-only buyers. Just as before, "veterans" who want higher discounts will still get their order taken by non-VIP buyers. Since the vast majority of buyers are not getting access to the flood of new 8% orders, this doesn't change the equation too much if you want the higher discounts.
I think the problem right now is the site has been flooded with new spenders from the Black Friday weekend, but not enough new buyers to offset.

I'm still not sold on the centralization argument. There are currently about 6000 full nodes. To hear the centralization arguments, you'd think increasing block sizes 10x would cut the # of full nodes in half. For that to be true, these full node operators have to be already at 10% of their bandwidth, or be running on 100GB hard drives. I really don't think that is the case. I run several full nodes, and have no intention of stopping (even with 100MB blocks). Others will continue as well.
For me it's a simple calculation. Bitcoin will survive and thrive with 20MB+ blocks. Maybe fewer nodes, but the network will carry on. It will **not** survive with 1MB blocks. Once that ceiling is hit and transactions become hard or expensive, bitcoin will quickly stop being useful, and therefore be worth less. People will start leaving to altcoins in droves, and I will probably join them.
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:45:04
Yes, transaction fees will pay miners. But not for many years. The idea is that lots of transactions with small fees will be enough compensation. This will not work with small blocks. At current block sizes, each transaction needs to cost $3+ for miners to profit. And that assumes difficulty doesn't increase (which it will).
So what's better? A system with 2,000 transactions costing $3 each, or 200,000 transactions costing 3 cents each? Bitcoin was always meant to be the latter.

This sounds like more of a gravatar issue than specifically a coinbase issue. Mainly because gravatar uses unsalted MD5's of emails as the user key. Many services use gravatar, and would likely be vulnerable to the same issue. (Github, for example). Though perhaps there is an implementation of gravatar's system that wouldn't be open to this sort of data exposure.
I've used gravatar on several of my projects, so I am open to people who have suggestions how to mitigate this.

@_date: 2015-05-31 06:27:02
Off-blockchain transactions require inherently centralized services. So the idea is to protect our decentralized value transfer system by building centralized ledgers on top of it? This inherently changes the utility of Bitcoin. It essentially becomes the clearing house between banks, rather than the globally accessible ledger it was designed to be. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin isn't useful if only a few centralized systems can actually afford to use it.

The official 21 Press Release on Medium goes into more detail about the possibilities of this technology:
Subsidized hardware and mining-on-your-phone is just one piece of the puzzle. They could also be integrating that hardware into micro-payment channels and security modules. Essentially they could use their connections with hardware/chip makers to make a "Trezor-on-your-phone". The possibility of using small bitcoin transactions for login/2-factor authentication is also super interesting.
I think with some real ingenuity and creative consumer applications, this is very exciting news for Bitcoin. In my view, all the nay-sayers talking about drained battery life and centralized mining are missing the bigger picture. 
This could be huge.

You don't need to run a node to use bitcoin. You do need to pay transaction fees. Small blocks lead to higher transaction fees making bitcoin less useful.

Is this your transaction?
According to bockchain.info, this address belongs to "Discus Fish (F2Pool)". Why the ATM would be pointing there is baffling.
It seems unlikely someone would compromise a machine, and then send it to a mining pool address (those funds are likely split between many different miners). Though it also seems strange that mining pool operators would run an ATM in DC.
Most likely explanation is mis-configuration. Maybe the owner left it on a default setting?
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:19:03
You're missing the point. Bitcoin will never grow past it's current fringe early-adopter status with 1mb blocks. The math simply doesn't work. If you want Bitcoin to succeed and grow, we need a solution to this. By keeping blocks at 1mb, you are dooming Bitcoin to failure. If Bitcoin scales and continues to grow in value, the network will naturally grow with it, regardless of block size.
If the 1mb block size prevents bitcoin from growing, or makes transactions insanely expensive, it will loose it's utility over night and thus it's value. Once it has no value, no one will care how many nodes there are. Then what's the point of being decentralized?

You're assuming everyone will just switch the this magical Lightning network (which doesn't even exist yet). I personally like using Bitcoin directly, at least for large transactions. Even when Lightning does launch, we will still hit block limits very soon. What happens then? We have to start paying $2 for each transaction?
It seems you're suggesting we wait to fix it until after it breaks. That doesn't sound like a solution.

The backup is the 24-word seed. They recommend writing it down on paper and putting that in a secure place. Yes, if somebody steals your seed, they can steal your coins. The alternative is to memorize the 24-word seed, which is hard to do.
The advantage of 12-word seeds is they are easier to memorize, but I usually write them down somewhere anyways. 24 words is more random and exponentially harder to brute-force.

I recently built a similar command-line nodejs tool for checking all my balances. It takes any xpub or regular address in a JSON file, and just returns a combined total for all of them. Uses CHAIN API to get balances.
I like your approach to the command line interface! I may work on it some more and throw it on github if others find it useful.
There is a problem with newer wallets that are doing BIP32/BIP44 HD that are also multi-sig, which makes it difficult to generate public addresses. (One example is bitpay's copay app @ copay.io) Anyone know how to do this sort of balance monitoring in these cases?

How is updating every client wallet and bitcoin-compatible API a smooth upgrade path? Hard forks have happened many times, and for the most part have been very smooth (especially if you enforce a 75% acceptance threshold). Forcing client implementations to upgrade their code has never happened, and can't possibly be done as fast as a hard fork.

This has been discussed previously. Gavin's original proposal from several months ago had a time-based algorithm for slowly increasing max block size automatically over many years. I agree that a network-based algorithm might be more effective.
The issue right now is consensus. There's too much argument and hyperbole surrounding the block size debate. This is why Gavin lowered his expectations, and is just trying to get consensus around 20MB. It's simpler, easier to understand, and easier to argue for/against. Even he admits this is still a temporary solution, but it will give the core devs breathing room for several years to devise a new long-term solution. The final solution will likely be an algorithm similar to what you are proposing.

There have been many hard forks in the past, depending on how you define it. Both soft and hard forks are still forks. If done properly, a block limit increase can be done softly.


By "clients", I mean wallets and API providers. Chain forks only impact nodes and miners. SW impacts a lot of API providers, block explorers, wallets, etc.
Not saying SW isn't an option we should explore. I just don't agree it's the "smoother" path. It's a very complicated temporary solution. I'd prefer a less complicated permanent solution.

The hard fork will happen eventually. Even those arguing with Gavin agree that 1MB won't work forever. The question is to do it now or later.

Responding to a contentious hard-fork with another contentious hard-fork is completely insane. If PoW changes, it won't be BTC anymore, just like Unlimited isn't. In fact, just changing block size would makes BTU more like BTC than a PoW change would. So now we have 3 coins?
Core got us into this by refusing to compromise. By trying to prevent a contentious hard-fork they forced one upon the community. This will not end well. If BU splits and attacks the network, it becomes the new Bitcoin. Swallow your pride and get over it.

Pretty sure that's the relevant constant.
To be fair it's not actually 4MB on chain; it's 4MB including segwit data, still 1MB limit excluding segwit data. So 4MB would be a "best-case" segwit block, which the chances of that actually happening on mainnet is basically 0. Someone with deeper understanding of segwit can probably explain it better than me.
@_date: 2015-08-03 22:39:54
I would say they are equal only in the need for a hard fork to change either rule. But they are not equal in terms of the consensus available to change either rule, either from devs or miners.
I think changing the 21M limit would be infinitely more controversial (which says a lot considering the lack of block size consensus).

As explained in the actual source wired article, this has been a known attack vector on PC's for a long time. It's not a new exploit, nor is it mac-specific. The fact that Macs are also vulnerable is interesting, but not surprising, considering the base hardware of most computers is basically the same (regardless of OS). At it's core this is a hardware-level attack, not an OS-level attack. That should make it more concerning than your average virus for sure.

Running your own full node is a pretty technical thing. On top of that, analyzing the history of addresses and blocks is even more difficult. I think public block explorers are very useful, and most people really don't have any other option for looking up transactions.
I run several full nodes, and I rarely check them directly. Mostly because the available open source analysis tools are generally quite terrible. Hopefully that changes in the future.

The simple version-
- BIP100 determines max block size by miner "voting" (it can increase or decrease)
- BIP101 determines max block size by timestamp (it only increases over time, based on "guestimates" of future bandwidth/computing power)

A thousand times this. There's a reason why "analysis paralysis" can be bad for open source, and why VERY few systems of governance ever require 100% agreement. It's simply impossible. And to argue Bitcoin should never have hard forks is to argue for it's eventual failure.

Important points:
1) bcoin was actually fully segwit ready before core was, and still is.
2) The EB proposal was under the assumption segwit wouldn't activate, so it was able to include some optimizations by moving segwit to ext block. In does technically break BIP141, but doesn't throw it away, it makes subtle tweaks on it.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:40:16
As I understand it, it uses segwit txs as pegs in-out of ext block. So the extension block is 100% segwit. So yes... no segwit on main chain.
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:52:53
Yes, that was the original proposal. Doesn't mean it can't be amended.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:41:17
f2pool did it without telling anyone, probably just as a joke. Not helping the proposal announcement. :/
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:16:50
This includes SegWit, essentially moving SegWit to the extension block.

Nothing secret going on. No softfork being deployed in real-time.
Proposal for a extension block soft fork is now available:
Code is still fresh and needs testing. It has NOT been deployed by anyone yet. Everything is open source and available for review.

3) The proposal can be amended to be BIP141 compatible, both key authors even said they will do this in response to asicboost. It didn't seem important to maintain BIP141-compat under the circumstances.
If the above is true, why the need for some conspiracy? Bcoin development has been solely funded by Purse.io for the past 16+ months. We have no need for external funding.
@_date: 2017-04-06 17:19:17
JJ and Joseph have both said the proposal could be updated to include main chain segwit. It wasn't done this way initially just for code simplicity, but clearly people are overly reading into it.
So I'll be clear as possible: Miners had no input on the spec. They weren't even aware of it until a few days before the public announcement. There was zero coordination. Not sure how else we can dispel with this conspiracy lie that people seem intent on spreading around.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:44:58
No. Bcoin receives some donations for overall protocol dev, but there are no such strings attached. If anyone can be said to have funded this, it's Purse.io (but not fully accurate, since non-Purse employees also contributed)
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:49:55
FWIW, the spec mentions mimblewimble as a future use case for ext blocks. I think everyone would prefer that, but it's a longer term solution since mimblewimble is still very alpha-stage; not ready for prime time yet.
@_date: 2017-04-04 02:57:12
I know it looks strange, and reddit loves conspiracies ;) But the behavior in the f2pool block was not actually consistent with bcoin implementation. Nobody had access to the implementation before it was public. It appears they just wanted to express support for the concept.
@_date: 2017-04-04 03:06:30
This is the part that is pure FUD. The proposal was not funded in secret, especially from miners. Per the spec, the proposal was drafted mainly by Purse CTO Christopher Jeffrey, and original Lightning author Joseph Poon. The bcoin implementation development was solely the work of Purse CTO JJ.
This came from neutral third parties. Some did get early looks at the draft to see if there was industry support, eg Stephen Pair from Bitpay, among others. It is likely f2pool was voicing support when the draft wasn't yet complete and public. This isn't some shadow dealing, just general industry asking peers if they agree/disagree with a draft proposal.

Siftscience is a behavior analyses/machine learning service for fraud detection. It is actually a really great tool, and no more invasive than Banks' CC fraud systems (in fact, probably less so).
Many ecommerce and Bitcoin companies use siftscience or equivilent tools. It is not unique to Coinbase. Also, Siftscience has backend reporting tools, so there are probably many sites that use it behind the scenes without you even knowing (eg. they don't load it on the frontend).
Further, if you're really concerned about it, you can use browser plugins that block common tracking tools (including Google Analytics). Though this is essentially useless, since most of the data is available on the backend anyway.
Don't like companies data-mining user behavior? Stop using the internet.

As a Bitcoin developer, I'm completely ignorant about markets and finance. I'll happily explain to you the ins-and-outs of the protocol, technical differences between wallets and security implementations, and can explain almost every BIP.

Incorrect. Netki does NOT run centralized servers doing all the lookups. The lookups are handled by your own DNS server (if you own the domain). They simply provide open source tools for wallet providers, and provide a service to simplify namecoin .bit creation.
I think the approach netki has taken is very open and integrates perfectly with Bitcoin wallets.

His gift cards are likely bought directly from localbitcoins. It is unlikely these gift cards are being bought with credit cards, but it depends on how he is sourcing them. Even legit Amazon gift cards have high markup because they are impossible to verify (once you enter the code, it's locked to your amazon account).

The BIPs are very technical, but it's just a short-hand for a specific Bitcoin standard. Some proposals are actual changes to the bitcoin protocol, others are recommendations to other bitcoin developers (eg, wallet app makers).
**BIP32:** "Deterministic Wallet" derivation, sometimes called "HD Wallets". Allows you to start with a base "seed" and derive random addresses in a predictable manner. This allows for greater address privacy (each time you withdraw/deposit, you get a new address), and better wallet backups (you only need to backup the starting seed).
**BIP39:** Mnemonic seed (the 24-words Trezor gives you are the "backup seed", sometimes called Mnemonic). This was standardized so wallets can use the same mnemonic "word list" and be cross-compatible. This allows for easy backup of your wallet. Essentially an extension on BIP32; the 12 or 24-word phrase is then used as the BIP32 seed.
**BIP44:** Standard derivation schema (Trezor uses this). Is just a standard way of doing hierarchical key generation, essentially another BIP32 extension.

I'm still waiting for someone to "scientifically" justify the 1MB limit currently in place. Satoshi did no math to determine that number, it just seemed like a nice round limit at the time.
All the "scientific" work others have done show 1MB is not the optimal number. It's just proving impossible to change due to politics. If we were basing this on empirical data, it would have been changed a long time ago.
So as far as I'm concerned, core devs "caved to non-scientific bullshit" years ago. It's all egos now.

I believe if the package is shipped via Amazon, the buyer can only see your Name and City/State. However if the item is shipped via Third Party Seller, sometimes they include a package slip that has both the Full Shipping and Full Billing address. So the address "leak" potentially goes both ways. Though Amazon is usually pretty good about this.

Basically. My salary is still recorded in $, but I am paid the BTC equivalent on payday (based on market rate that day). Price drops mostly affect my "savings", but with the added benefit that the next payday I will receive more BTC to match the equivalent USD.

I run 3 full nodes, and was originally inspired by full node.co to set them up! Thanks for the service. 
For others interested in running full nodes, the bandwidth/disk requirements are quite low. I run one on my home Comcast network, and barely notice the bandwidth usage. It runs on my media center which is on 24/7 anyway.
The more full nodes the better, even if they are geographically close, they contribute to the stability of he whole network.

I thought mining was centralized, in which case this isn't an issue. Seems to only be a problem if mining really is decentralized. We really have gone full circle. /s
I don't think it's an actual problem because the reality is miners do connect directly to each other anyway (in order to get fast block relay times). Makes this a non-issue.

Part of this is because bitcoind's built in wallet is really quite terrible. Can't handle the scale of even medium sized bitcoin businesses. Outsourcing this to third-party "wallet services" that could potentially handle larger scale makes more business sense. The closest I've seen to a fully integrated package for this is bitcore-wallet-service, which itself runs on top of a custom fork of bitcoind to handle large scale wallets. (But is generally a huge PIA to setup). If the goal is to get bitcoin businesses to run their own full nodes, bitcoin core has a lot more work to do. That doesn't appear to be a priority at the moment.

I tried the Ninki chrome app some months ago, and loved the UI! However the experience of adding a friend was not great, which made me stop using Ninki. Basically my friend and I had to share our xpub through some chat program to "validate" the friend request. 
Has this been improved to no longer require manually copy/pasting of the xpub key?
Edit: Should clarify I'm referring to the "validation phrase"

I'd be happy to give you a list of grievances off-thread. ;) 
Suffice to say there's a reason most businesses are choosing BitGo or Blockcypher over running their own node. And it's not purely financial; at scale those services can cost significantly more than just running a bitcoind node. It's mostly related to good developer support and robust API features. Most of which bitcoind lags way behind on (simple example; core should have had HD wallets years ago).
Even so, to your point, another company adding yet another full node on AWS isn't really that great for decentralization. This is another example of the overall consolidation of cloud services (of which bitcoin is a small part).
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:58:50
Thanks for the response! I really like Ninki as a wallet, and think it has much potential. The in-person mobile experience seems much easier.
Though I do recommend giving some thought to how to make the friend validation simpler on the chrome app, especially if you want the network to grow rapidly. Ideally it shouldn't require sharing the validation phrase outside of the app itself.
Good luck! I will be watching your mobile progress closely :)

I'd actually be willing to pay taxes on my BitCoin income voluntarily, as long as I can pay the IRS in BitCoins. If I have to pay taxes in cash on BitCoin income (which is what you do have to do with "barter cash"), then I say fuck that.
However, if I say had 1000 bitcoins and sold those bitcoins for hard cash at current market value, I would suddenly have $60,000 in my bank account. That income would obviously be taxed as any other income. If instead I spent those bitcoins on a new car, I should only have to pay the sales tax, which I would be willing to pay in bitcoins but not in cash.
Obviously the technicalities of bitcoin make it impossible to tax in this way, unless it was voluntary.

While I'm not sure about the relation to politics directly, I do like the idea of a blockchain-style p2p system for electronic voting. This would make each ballot cast impossible to reverse or alter, and you can get an anonymous hash as your voting ID, which is made completely public through the public transaction history. Since the hash is impossible to reverse, nobody will know who voted for what. The system would be essentially infallible. An entire election can be reduced to a 20-byte hash string, and this could allow for live-to-the-second election results. The data miner in me finds this thrilling; just thinking of all the cool graphs I could make.
This reminds me of [git]( in a lot of ways. Uses similar cryptographic principals as the blockchain to ensure the integrity of your project history.
