Everyone laughed at Draper when he bought at $650 .. Who is having last laugh now :) 
Same will happen with Masa-San. He is not in the rush to sell. He will hold on .. 
Lets check in couple of years :)

Emercoin has solid technology behind it and that was reason for the backing. The teams marketing and community engagement needs strengthening. We will continue helping project once crypto markets start recovering.

Sensless allegation .. the fees are much much less, but then hey whoever is paying you to spread the BS probably IS paying you that much .. lol

Cryptomat fees are 4-6 prc depending on transaction size .. the alternative for people to use local currency and buy btc are close to 10 prc. I want to understand where did you obtain the 13 prc ?

first of all I dont see dollar collapsing anytime soon. despite the massive budget deficits, USA is still a powerhouse economy and hotbed of tremendous innovation and entrepreneurship. You also need to ask a question "USA collapsing against whom" If you come to think of it on a global scale USA is doing quite well. Europe is in deep trouble and China has big issues with aging demographics and non performing loans on state bank levels. But at the end of the day if dollar starts going down it will just take many more of them to buy BTC, but BTC is also valued in many other currencies so I would not worry .. there will be many options .. Hwr if you leave in USA and dollar will be collapsing this will prompt huge inflation and inflation is the worst enemy of people so they will suffer. holding BTC in such conditions is a prudent bet .. good luck

Its not racism its the reality.. look at vast majority of tech illiterate btc bashers : buffet , krugman, sherman .. you get the clue

very difficult.. thats why best option is to tie yourself to a mining gear that gives you OUT bitcoins over time so that you are not in a rush to spend them :) I ve seen tons of people sell at $400 and $600 when price got moving from $220 level , but those that had mining gear had to "stay in" and done on average extremely well :)) good luck
