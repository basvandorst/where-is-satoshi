Should I have one wallet and do all my receiving and sending from there, or should I have a few 'logically' separated wallets?
Right now, I tend to create different wallets for different purposes.  So I have one wallet to receive donations, one wallet where I buy bitcoins from Bittylicious, one wallet to receive bitcoins from selling things.  I don't know if one wallet has an advantage or vice-versa.

If I have two wallets in Multibit, is there any way to move the money from one wallet to another without a transaction fee?  Some way to combine the two locally on my own machine? 
If I wanted to move it all from Multibit to Bitcoin-Qt - locally, is that possible?

Thanks, the bit in bold is the crucial bit for me.

I think we'll find out soon enough; it is normal not to comment during an investigation.  You may recall during AWS's big outage a few years ago and Azure's outages and all the big players: Usually operations are restored first and then a few days later you get a big blog post explaining what happened.  If there is no explanation in a few weeks, then most definitely something is not right.  However, restoring operations quickly is not fishy, it's crucial to their business.

Reasonable overallocation to begin with. Then you can set up Cloudwatch to alert you if you're approaching X%, and have autoscaling trigger off that.  Even with a 5min provision time per instance, it works very well.

Many options these days.  You can use Puppet/Chef to provision servers.  Cloudformation(AWS) to manage infrastructure.  They would have had their provisioning scripts already available and likely in use in pre-live environments.  The rest of it comes down to source control, and deployment of the state (DBs, caching) that the software itself relies on.

The rebuild from ground up is just a figure of speech because of the very next sentence.  It isn't literal.  From the rest of the post, they talk about minor tweaks, multi sigs, that's about it.
