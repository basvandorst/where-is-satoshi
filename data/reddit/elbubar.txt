Would be great to buy more ! If so i would be just sad that i bought too high but I do want to stop thinking in fiat...

Said I want to. Not that I do. Still very hard. But as an example I am not saying I wait until 1 btc equals 500k but I will directly buy a house with my btc. I did already said goodbye to my money. I prefer losing everything than gaining 10k instead of a full house. ;)
Sorry for my english. Not my mothertongue...

Correction around 14k-15k then pump IMO

And that makes me feel very sad :)
Resistance is reach btw. So the range is between 14k and 15.5k. Let's speak again in a few hours. (Said the guy who don't want to think in fiat. Aka me)

Yo absolutely need to read and understand the way it does work. You also need to trust the idea behind it, if not you will loose a lot trying not to.
So when people tell you to invest only what you can afford to loose, listen to them.
Nobody but you can be responsible of your choices. It is a very risky investment so your overthinking sounds better than greedy people wanting to be rich tomorrow.
I would suggest you, if you do have these 8-9K $ to use this strategy:
Plan. Do or not, but stop hesitating.

Let me check on my magic crystal ball... 
It says that price and value are two different things and that even 20k is a huge underestimation of the technology. I really don't think that we can break all the supports until 4000. But you know... confirmation bias... I happy to find reasons to believe in that.

I do just accept it. It is a long term investment and I'd rather loose everything than miss the opportunity to get higher.
Not trying to time the market as I suspect exchange not being able to scale this DDoS panic sell.
