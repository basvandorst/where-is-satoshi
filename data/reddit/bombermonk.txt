move it to gdax and transfer it to your wallet from there, no fees
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:11
over 19k on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:14:49
moving money or coins from coinbase to gdax is free

If he doesn't plan to trade then a paper wallet is better. You don't really own the coins on coinbase so when it goes bankrupt or gets hacked you are fucked.

It seems coinbase is scared or someting of opening trading all of a sudden ... they weren't when they added BCH

Thank you so much for this, I was tired of these graphs not updating!
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:31:39

you don't need to create a new account, you just use your coinbase account ...

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:59:38
Myes you do need two pieces of I'd. I noticed the verification works way better on the coinbase app.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:20:31
well that didn't take long ...
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:53:38
Same stuff going on in belgian media

I used search on the fees page but can't find anything about EEA zone countries.
Just says the SEPA fees
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:27:12
not if you do it straight from gdax, they will pay your transaction fees!

I wonder how many times he checked if the address was correct and refreshed to see how many confirmations.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:08:42
it dropped from 9000e to 7000e for just a second or so, 5 minutes later back at 9000
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:19:51
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:16:38
eah if you check the BTC/EUR pair and at 3:18 UTC ( I guess, exactly 1 hour ago) you shall see the drop
