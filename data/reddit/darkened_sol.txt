Woke up to see this, what a crazy morning.
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:48:52
Where will you have it tattooed? 
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:25:23
Great design, please, print 1000!
@_date: 2014-05-20 15:31:51
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:49:57
Don't breathe this!
@_date: 2014-05-14 02:00:21
What business do you do if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2014-04-03 14:01:10
What is this from please?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:54:02
Haha that gif!
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:03:00
Also, would it be possible to withdraw fiat from these ATM's? 
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:14:47
Professor Bitcorn, is that you?
@_date: 2014-04-28 01:05:12
Just like magic.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:49:58
Am I watching Fox news or something?!
@_date: 2014-02-18 02:25:48
So under the limit you don't need proof?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:59:02
Is there a charge for using the ATM? 
@_date: 2014-04-09 00:53:44
How much did that charge?
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:24:52
It sounds to me that this gives them the power to ask random passengers for proof of where it came from by using 'suspect illegal activity' as the excuse then?

@_date: 2014-03-05 12:23:04
Haha although OP's design is nice, I like the original one too, why can't we see him on the sub's page anymore?
@_date: 2014-04-26 16:26:03
Ahh I see, thanks for clearing that up. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:45:54
The woman doesn't seem to have a clue about any of this 'Bitcoin talk'.
@_date: 2014-04-25 22:32:15
I am genuinely interested why would you have spent $600 worth in Bitcoins instead of fiat if they accepted them? I see a lot of posts/comments to suggest that they prefer to pay in Bitcoins. Is it because it's just easier to pay in Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-04-13 19:51:40
Clearly someone need to introduce you to multiple pass zeroing!
@_date: 2014-04-30 20:49:20
I was so confused when I looked at this image. Then I saw the title (I open several links at a time).
@_date: 2014-05-20 16:11:33
Thailand reopened an exchange but I don't think that's a big factor in the increase either.
@_date: 2017-02-23 17:36:38
How would you do that?
@_date: 2017-08-11 11:57:46
What service can be used to accept BTC and convert back to fiat with minimum fees? Thinking from a perspective that a small vendor might want to accept it yet not keep it in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:39:39
Hi, I'm trying to redeem my Bitcoin Cash from Blockchain.info.
I have my 12 word wallet recovery phrase from blockchain.info and typed them in the BIP39 mnemonic field of the generator here:  I've left everything else as defaults and I'm getting a 'Invalid Mnemonic' error.
I have also noticed that if I go to Settings &gt; Addresses, I have the message:
*Imported Addresses  Not backed up by your Recovery Phrase. Transfer into a wallet to secure funds.*
Would that be the reason why it wasn't working?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:21:14
That's amazing to hear!
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:40:01
UK but hodling in EUR. What's going on!? :D hype for upcoming segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:13:40
I decided to get rid of BCH and reinvest it in BTC, XRP and LTC. Let's see how it goes!
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:50:00
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:11:31
16.25 hours
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:18:05
So this must be the reason behind the recent price hike! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:08:51
That's too hilarious to be real, right?!
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:35:10
How many times has it 'died' now? I keep losing track :)
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:38:33
I let out a significantly large amount of air out my nostrils. Thanks for the morning chuckle!
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:24:17
When is it going to go *over 9000?!* ;)
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:20:35
Is it worth hodling BCH?
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:52:45
When ICO?
@_date: 2018-02-12 22:36:53
I wonder does this still apply if it is time-shifted say, by 30 minutes? It would then not be live.
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:03:36
Check out Bitcoinium! 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:20:53
What's happening Aug 1st?
@_date: 2017-06-06 10:47:37
Redi for over 9000
@_date: 2017-06-12 01:07:41
Why do you think that out of curiosity?
@_date: 2017-06-06 18:47:33
Thanks. HODL!
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:51:03
I'm interested about how it works, would businesses choose to keep the Bitcoins or do they convert to local currency after say, a certain amount is reached?
@_date: 2013-11-29 12:40:14
Can't you just withdraw the bitcoins and deposit in BTC-e and repeat?
