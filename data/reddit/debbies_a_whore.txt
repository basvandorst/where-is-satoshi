So are you in favor of lowering taxes? Do you believe in trickle down economics? what areas of government specifically would you privatize if you had the opportunity?

People who buy bitcoin include a large amount of speculative investors. The stock market is providing much better returns right now. They have moved their money from bitcoin to the stock markets. 
Alibaba IPO for one.
Also mining companies have been dumping bitcoin to pay electricity bills because of its lower value.

What about the water table in Texas. Right now there is a major drought. Do you believe in climate change and what can be done if anything to stop the desertification of Texas? Some projections show that there won't be enough water to supply the cities within 25 years. And if a major infrastructure project is needed to increase water (desalination plants) how do you intend to pay for it with the current tax base or do you believe the private sector will step in and sell water at a premium?

If you are asking r/bitcoin for advice on business moves, you have more problems then deciding whether it should be web based or app based.
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:33:29
well both

once someone got your access key, they don't need to know how much you have, they'll just take whatever you have.

If everyone stops buying and selling and their is no intrinsic demand for the currency on the open market besides the current market players, prices will fall big time. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:23:25
stability is pricing makes it a more viable option for use as a currency. Less risk imparted on the business for accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:48:47
the small business tax is only 15% and they could hold funds within the company and all there expenses would be deductible (including the purchase of mining equipment). Also wouldn't this open up the possibility of holding bitcoins in tax sheltered accounts like TFSA's?
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:01:23
And also vice versa. I wouldn't reuse a paper wallet, but generate a new one though.

That is only if reddit it based in New York.. they can move to Canada and operate normally.

I like this question. I'd like to hear a reply for this as well.
@_date: 2014-07-27 20:31:33
I understand that there exists a segment of the population that thinks like you. I respect your opinion.. Fight the power man!
@_date: 2014-06-17 06:16:06
So is the U.S. dollar
@_date: 2014-08-28 14:59:30
The US government is the largest holder of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-02 06:03:51
Great another massive sell off when all those merchants immediately dump their bitcoin. Put a short on those bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:24:45
Is this a good or bad thing? I mean regulation creates a clearer framework for business's to enter the market.
@_date: 2014-07-27 09:47:56
you're sounding a bit extreme. i think you need to relax.
@_date: 2014-09-03 05:12:24
fuck putting it in a safe.. I store them in a shoe box with family pictures and shit.. No one is stealing that thing.
@_date: 2014-07-26 09:17:42
libertarian parties scare me. I am for the decentralization of market goods and believe in the core liberal concepts that make up progressive democratic markets, but Libertarian politics rarely ever address government industry that are essential, instead they say get rid of everything cause we believe in this concept of liberty to an extreme. Well a belief system and reality can vary greatly. 
Regulations are going to come and need to be clear. How it is implemented in the United States unfortunately will be on a state by state basis. You will see progressive legislation in some states that does not hinder entry to the market and protect the rights to private ownership without undue oversight from the government and you will see the opposite in other states. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:26:01
because every government in the world actively combats money laundering. You'll have every government in the world actively combating bitcoin if that happens. It'll be pushed to the fringes again.
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:26:02
Also merchants puts down pressure on bitcoin. I am really not for any merchant adoption at this point. It makes much more sense to make bitcoin into a money movement system (i.e. international money transfers, travel). 
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:33:42
It'll be worth it when I move over some of my fiat money holdings into bitcoin when the price goes below 500 US.. 
@_date: 2014-07-26 17:25:16
bitcoin won't self regulate money laundering. that's a fact. If you want bitcoin ETF's and atm's then you are going to need to have regulation. Now is New York doing it right? Well that is completely up to interpretation.
@_date: 2014-06-07 17:22:27
you could set up sloppy wallets with small amounts... leave the private keys laying around your computer and see if money starts disappearing.. If that is the case then your computer has been compromised.

I agree he could be trying to manipulate the community and the market to his own benefit. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 04:16:52
Are you doing this as an investment strategy? There a few things to consider if that is what you are trying to achieve.
@_date: 2014-06-24 00:41:49
I think a lot of potential adopters are taking a wait and see approach right now. Once the user interface catches up and makes it more accessible to the common user a number of interesting scenarios can play out.
@_date: 2014-08-29 04:34:28
yes really. google it

I'd get the private key tattoo'd on my head and grow my hair out.
@_date: 2014-06-16 00:13:45
Great idea!
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:32:48
Did you just create your platform based on reddit's most popular opinions?
@_date: 2014-05-11 15:18:34
Conversely, if people stop buying/selling and the price of bitcoin begins to go down, that could be one of the worst things to happen to the currency thus far.
@_date: 2014-06-17 01:13:19
If you use the same email and password twice for any of your bitcoin accounts.. You're asking for someone to steal all your bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-26 19:45:55
paying taxes in bitcoin would be glorious

What is your position on fiscal policy, state powers, are you for or against decentralization of government, did you support the bail out, gun rights, and what specifically about the NSA do you oppose?
