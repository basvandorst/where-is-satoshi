Kkraken is good for deposits and withdraws, BUT, only when the market is 'quiet'.
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:59:05
in busy/volatile/most interesting moments to trade? BS!!! it never works for no one, not in the beginning nor the end. when the market is 'quiet', then oke. and still, the main page shows for one coin at least 2 different values, most of the time even 3, so when you wanna trade at marketvalue, you never know at witch value you're selling/buying, in 'quiet' AND busy times!

one time i had a simular situation, more or less. i wanted to sell in the beginning of a dump. i kept getting internal error. then the price went up, and i thought: thank you Kraken for being shitty. then a dump began, and i thought: now i'm going to sell. but this time i had 'unsefficient funds'-error??!! i refreshed and then i saw that the sell happened when i had internal error.
lots of other times it just didn't sell or buy. you're lucky if you even manage to log in after a half an hour.
Kraken has the shittiest UI of all exchanges. they make good profits, so why would they invest in a new UI? the people who know how shitty they are leave, but there are always new clients.
you can use Kraken for deposits and withdraws, ONLY, i repeat: ONLY when the markets are more or less 'silent'.
but good news is coming! there are already startups (like Qvolta) where you can trade on the blockchain, direct purchases/sells with sellers/buyers without the need of an exchange. so aaaaall these criminal organisations (read: exchanges) will become unnecessary.
by the way, did you guys notice that on the mainpage there are 3 different values for 1 coin? let's take eth for example: on the right side it's 300$, on the left side it's 287$ and above it's 303$. when you go to trade at marketprice, you never know at wich price you're selling/buying. check this out!

and then you will not be able to login. when you do get logged in after lots of trials, you wont be able to trade, or withdraw. after you smashed your head/keyboard/mouse/almost broke your desk/almost broke your hand/made losses, you will post a sub here asking for help/advise. you will get one voice from different users, saying: LEAVE KRAKEN AS-THE-FUCK-A-P!!!!!

491407 - 491312 = 95
lets say a block takes about 10min
95 * 10 = 950min
950 / 60min = 15.83h
how did you calculate to think 1-2h?
