Great! article, you have nearly mirrored and expressed how I see Bitcoin, and envisage it's use in the future.
All that is required, is a virtual link into "No Mans Sky" 
( NMS) and the possibilities will be endless. ;D)

I normally eat **popcorn** whilst watching entertainment, fictional or otherwise, I might suggest **HODLCORN** for this **blockbuster**!

The war on Bitcoin
Remember when Safaricom "African Mobile Carrier" obtained a dubious Judgement and Court order to [ban]( Bit-Pesa from using their network?.
Well that decision appeared shady at best, and corrupt as hell! 
The answer to the above condrum has been solved by this press release about [mVisa]( 
Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of these elite shills are all in bed with the Central Bankers and their corrupt government minions.
