I can conceive of myriad problems with large unwieldy systems as well. But are you suggesting you don't think the blockchain could dramatically change government and make it much tougher for corruption? Strikes me as a no-brainer.

pretty juicy. another two years experience and i'll get there.

Strikes me as if you might be a regulator or not following my argument. Government audit would vastly improve with transactions on the blockchain, since you're not really arguing how this can't work, then its tough to even discuss the idea, because virtually everyone in the bitcoin space agrees with this simple concept of improved transparency. Once transactions make it to the blockchain, well then your nonpartisan oversight, could literally be oversight by anyone and everyone. That brings an ultra fast, broad based, near free market to regulation. Major improvement.

Actually a large part of the treasury's might be. But seigniorage is but a drop in the bucket of the state's total.

If there's one central authority, there's no need for mining, you just need a spreadsheet.

When is he going to speak on the [Cardboard Box Reform]( It might just be my favorite video on all of YouTube. And really needs to be a Ted Talk.

This whole antifragile thing annoys me. Is my house antifragile? It was built in 1873, and it is now stronger with better locks, sprinklers and fire detectors, super new windows, a bigger kitchen etc. That's not antifragile that is just 'maintained by owner'. That's what Bitcoin is, that's what my house is.

I know. Taleb basically just come up with another name for evolution via natural selection. A biological idea we've understood since 1859. His 300 page rant exists merely to convince himself and us of this novelty. Its not novel.

If you haven't seen James' November 3rd video - The Cardboard Box Reform, it is an important work, that could have enormous repercussions. This is a summary of the video, just a summary, his video is much more nuanced and detailed with dozens of charts and lots of data.
Concerned about the dramatic rise in inequality, campaign finance, gridlock of Congress and partisanship over the last 45 years? Well, James' November 2014 study ( may provide hope. Highlighting Gilens' (Princeton study) data, it has found the most unusual (indeed counterintuitive) source for our current explosion in inequality and campaign financing (1970 to present). D'Angelo found it in a place that surely no economist would look, the secret ballot.
Considered by many to have crushed the first gilded age, the secret ballot was introduced en masse in the US starting in 1890. By 1940 it was everywhere (all citizens and congressmen voted privately). And then for 30 years life was pretty good. Inequality was dropping, so were a number of other metrics, partisanship, campaign finance etc. And then, October 26th, 1970 there was a crack in our air-tight democracy - The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 opened up the votes of Congress (the committee of the whole). Dubbed a ’sunshine law’, this bill has only ever been considered a good thing.
The trouble is, we vote in secret for a reason – reasons most Americans forget. Every time votes are public we get massive explosion in two types of electoral fraud. The first form of Electoral Fraud is Vote Buying (Tammany Hall, etc), with as much as 20% of the electorate being paid to vote a specific way (often poor individuals being paid with a chicken wing or a beer). The second form is Voter Intimidation, often times people would vote in the local court house, and they would just announce their vote to the local staff. The trouble with voting publicly (stating your votes to a clerk) is that often citizens were voting on deputies and sheriffs who were sitting right there in the court house, listening. It is hard to vote against an evil Sheriff if he can see how you vote. It is easy to see the problem there.
Interestingly, this is exactly what now happens in our Congress. Inside of congress, Voter intimidation leads to massive partisanship and polarization, and the vote buying leads to what some congressmen call ‘legalized bribery’. The convictions, admissions and stories of this are common (Jack Abramoff, ABACAM, etc etc). And this change in 1970 has led to a feedback loop that responds to the ever increasing money in Washington. Indeed The Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 is the cause for the phenomenal growth of K-street. And all the big firms were born just months after it passed. The trouble is no one has ever called it what it is, Electoral Fraud. And the beauty is, all these alarming trends can be reversed by re-instating the secret ballot.

hmmm. now that's interesting. thanks!

Wow. I was not prepared for the conclusion. Very cool.

I like the author's previous stuff. And yes I read the book. Not impressed. Its a 300 page rant. Sure evolution is a great example of antifragile, but everything else is simply 'maintained by owner'. Bitcoin is getting incremental improvements by the owners (core devs) and lots of owner paint jobs, running around proselytizing (users) and spends millions a day protecting the network (miners). And I see the analogy, but it just isn't spot on. And frankly the foolish optimism built into the idea of antifragile blinds us to the reality of the matter. We need to maintain it to make it work.

you can't decentralize tipping until transaction fees go to zero. which means, likely never.
@_date: 2014-12-01 05:00:26
Disagree. If point A and point B both had public addresses on the blockchain, then if point B claims they didn't receive the money, any 3rd grader would be able to look at the blockchain and tell you if he's lying or not, or whether point A even sent the money. Full transparency. A killer app of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:42:49
I'll quote myself from a previous comment.


@_date: 2014-11-18 15:34:38
No argument there. Always someone smarter than me. But you do understand the problem there right? All the tipping models take bitcoin off the blockchain - by necessity. So they centralize. By necessity. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 19:33:28
Perhaps. Even altcoins would provide much lower fee structures. But again these tips people have been making lately are so small that any transaction fees would cut into the tip itself.
@_date: 2015-11-12 17:05:04
And then there's [this](
James does a pretty good job at exploding the entire block-size debate into the real problem – centralization and identity. I can't figure out any way to counter his argument.
