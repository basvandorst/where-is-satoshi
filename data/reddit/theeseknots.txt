Bitcoin is the blockchain!!!!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:21:13
I know what a blockchain is. Bitcoin is the truest form of any blockchain. Without theese 3 traits you can no longer call yourself a blockchain. 1. Decentralized 2. immutable 3. censorship resistant  capish comprende ?
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:09:55
But it's been a bubble since 2009 experts have said so lol please bitcoin i here to stay just a matter of time months and will be back over 20k !! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:39:27
True and all other uses other than currency can be put on top of the most secure blockchain of Bitcoin !!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:37:37

@_date: 2018-02-01 16:17:58
Its fud ..the bubble was from 6k to 19k that was a bubble alright .... But bitcoins value is easily far greater then this early bubble valuation . easily 50 k and higher in the coming month's or year. Stay tuned 
@_date: 2018-02-20 03:06:28
Yeah idk what happened but here you go............
There has been plenty of counter argument ... Nobel prize winners top economist top of whatevee they do . all they say is Bubble tulips ponzi thats coming from great minds ... Mind you the brightest minds can be corrupted by living in their wealth or their beloved monetary system that they grown accustomed to and has been great to them . so revolutionary change is not capable for them in their bright minds. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:09:15
I Hodl! Will hodl when at 20k again!
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:19:50
Lol not needed we dont need fools .. Hopefully most of the people that were in it for the fear of missing out and for the naive believe that it'll only go up have sold and dont return until bitcoin is fully functional world currency.

@_date: 2018-03-03 15:45:12
I dont care for the lawsuit i just would like to see coinbase burn for being anti bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:33:06

Lol please who would use their miner coin . No one would and they would come back running and mining bitcoin .. Better learn that miners dont control bitcoin they just process transactions and in the process keep bitcoin safe. They dont have the final say on what bitcoin upgrades we recieve. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:15:41
Well miners tried to push their agenda and failed .. Users said no we are going this way and succeeded miners had no choice but to follow us .

Bitcoin is not a bad investment.. The lambo meme happened a long time before we hit 1000 2000 3000 19000 $ and for those that got bitcoin when the meme started they probably already have a lambo or 2 
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:07:57

Lol you have no clue what a un hackable decentralised censorship resistant currency is worth. No permission neede not one type of paper form needed to open an account.. Send any amount of money 1 dollar to 1 billion dollars instantly cheap to anyone anywhere in the world! That is valuable .. Also 21 million bitcoins will ever exist no printung money out of thin air. Get informed before you even talk about a subject you clearly have no understanding on.

@_date: 2018-02-01 17:26:30
Bitcoin doesnt need their permission... Government are going to adapt to bitcoin and welcome it as japan has and Venezuela their people use bitcoin because their government money is worth less than monopoly money 
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:59:26

Ohhh here we go with the never ending FUD 
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:34:58
What i meant to say that uasf worked because the majority of us users wanted segwit. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 00:39:25
Jp morgan = or greater than boe in regards of importance and ..i could simply care less us bitcoin believers dont give a f*** about any bank

Ill take you on that 30k easily this year 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:08:05
Yes always remember. Uasf user stand united against a few people who would love to control bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:58:47
Ok let's assume your right assume.... When bitcoin started and it hit 100 first then 1000 and then crashed to 200 the bankers economist nobel prize winners financial media the works  where all over it as a bubble and all this other crap ..then it hit 1000 and again the bitcoin haters came out in full swing and then 10000 and then 19900 and now 11000 what have theese orchestrated attacks against bitcoin have caused ? Is bitcoin worth 0 ? Bitcoin still has a lot to prove but all the people economist have nothing to prove they already failed aginst bitcoin. So yes they can have their public perception team in full swing and wont harm bitcoin olny make it ��. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:21:25
People who understand that its human nature to attack something that is a threat to them. Understand now ?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:11:05

You always have to include a fee. I believe the fees are low again like 10 20 30 cents fee
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:29:38
You have the wrong wallet .. Use samori wallet you can manually set the fee and they'll have a recommended fee wich at the time is a few cents. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:08:22

@_date: 2018-02-10 19:42:24
Lol again if the miners didn't upgrade to segwit and split of the chain they would of burned and be mining a minority chain at a loss. While uasf is infact working users decided segwit and guess what we have now ?
