This is my point. Even if we take away the math with card usage, it’s still difficult to tell what something costs especially once we get to 6th, 7th and 8th digits. I can imagine people making all kinds of mistakes which could cost them good money. Heck, I imagine scams will be on the rise too. Even if we display fiat value side by side still have to worry about whether it’s right.

The reason for my number is that I believe a large portion of the worlds wealth will be shifted to virtual money. I think bitcoin, iota and eos will play a very large role in this shift as we move into the internet of money. Once every physical assets value becomes digital and much of the worlds money shifts into virtual state we may very well be looking at millions per coin.

UX designer here ready to donate my services. I have a good understanding of what makes for an easy experience and my biggest concern to date is the divisibility of bitcoin and other crypto currencies. What makes fiat so handy is the nice round numbers. You can buy so many things with $1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100. The simple, rounded numbers are just inherently easy to understand and calculate. With credit and debit use in most cases we no longer even do math to calculate change. This is just not the case with crypto currencies. I can see an argument being made for card transactions but even then an average person will have a difficult grasp on 0.000781 purchase. Sure. We can make up names for smaller nominations but even then we have far more digits to worry about. Say I use a crypto debit card how do we display price that’s easy to understand at the merchant level? Will a bag of chips be just as easy to purchase for 0.000913 of something as say ... $4? This and other issues like it bother me and make me question the whole concept of crypto as currency. I know there will be a ton of objections to my comment from people who are tech literate but there is a vast majority of people who have a difficult time even grasping bitcoin yet alone learning how to use it.

How is it fully secure? Lightweight- cash don’t weigh much neither do cards. International- there you have a point. Free - not really, every time you load a wallet or buy the crypto in the first place you’re paying a fee. Sarcasm only makes you sound like an ignorant idiot who tries to end a conversation instead of critically thinking through various viewpoints. Also don’t forget with digital cash you need battery power. Unless you carry a paper wallet then that defeats the purpose.

@_date: 2018-06-03 21:04:31
Today is it’s not the cheapest way because you get taxed on cashing out. I just did a transfer to myself and had to use traditional transfer methods precise because of tax implications. 
About your point - I carry a bill, you carry a phone - we all have to carry something. I thinks sending money to a different country is not a primary concern for most people. I am definitely not saying there’s no value in bitcoin because here I am, but when people try to force use cases where alternatives works just fine I have to say something.
@_date: 2018-06-14 01:36:38
A fork is not a payment. Forks only appear as free money because they either create new value or no value at all. In case of new value created through augmented tech, the market decides if the forked coin is worth anything. Nobody is forcing anyone to buy it. The fact that you can sell it just goes to show that someone on the other end sees value in it or is speculating - perfectly normal market forces. 
In the case of a money grab split with no new perceived value, well the same applies - the market decides if it's worth anything.

This is a very narrow way to look at Bitcoin. When new internet money appears and people notice that it increases in value - speculation follows. This is perfectly natura and expected. The reason for slow adoption is partly because it feels too good to be true and the world is pretty fixed on fiat. Go tell a govt that we plan to replace your wealth system by not asking your permission or getting you involved and what do you expect will happen. The fact is Bitcoin has shown to be highly resistant to many of the worlds pressures. It has withstood for 9 years and continues to prosper. Overspeculation happens all the time in every market - corrections follow. Bubbles form and pop but bat doesn't make something shit. The other reason for slow adoption is the technical aspects of actual usage - it's not friendly or easy like cash, but this is the price you pay for a never before seen trustless system. It is up to the people furthering the tech to make it user friendly. I don't know if you are old enough but you used to have to boot up your PC through command line interface. Imagine your grandma trying to use that. Now we just tap a button and our never off device turns on instantly. It took a very long time for things to get that way, Bitcoin and crypto in general is no exception. People who think narrowly, take for granted what people like me do for this world - make things user friendly. Please stop and think before you post something that makes you look stupid.

If you look at tech adoption it typically builds on to some other acceptable means of doing things. iPods, youtube, Pokemon go - these are not revolutionary concepts although they are great - the barrier to change is very low. Bitcoin and the concept of trustees money and banking are society-changing concepts that defy age old institutions and powerful interests. We are talking about a fundamentally different society if and when the vision is realized so forgive it for not catching on as quickly because Ellen DeGeneres does not agree with the concept of self-banking and doesn't promote it on every episode as she did Twitter.

Bitcoins product value is beyond what you are describing, in fact it is vastly underrepresented at this point. If you can’t see that now then I would understand your comparison to a bubble. What we are witnessing now is the virtualization of money. This is the only logical next step to a global currency that will be required to operate in a global world. Call me utopian and shit but I don’t think the naysayers quite realize what we are going through and the fact that we have barely entered this stage. I won’t argue for a second that most people in it now are for a quick buck, but these people don’t realize what they are dealing with. The shift to crypto will happen, it’s just a matter of when and who will capitalize on the move. Eventually we will do away with all physical money and assets will be digitalized. Once we are “done” so to speak, someone will be very well off while others will just exist in the ecosystem at some level, but both of these groups will have to coexist. 
I guess you need to zoom out to see the large picture and then do some math at the potential of this thing. Only then will you see that this so called bubble is only but a raindrop in a Great Lake.

This kind of public behavior worries me more than anything. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:07:49
So adults acting like teens. Got it.

Clicked this post to see picture of pizza. Fuck I’m hungry.

Speculative paranoia much?
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:38:29
Will the state also pay a 40% short term cap gains tax on their income then? Lol
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:27:49
Mooching off the good bitcoin name to perpetuate their scam. Fucking scum, make me sick.
@_date: 2018-04-02 13:03:24
I think you meant scamcoin. But yeah, tons of haters from that sub following a scumbag.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:07:53
Good, love me some of that organic Bitcoin from the north

If satoshi himself says Bcash is fake, then I don’t know what the fuck else you need to convince you.
@_date: 2018-04-12 03:59:47
Declaration of Independence right there. In Satoshi we don't have to trust!!! 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:36:21
Good citizen. Good on you.
@_date: 2018-04-14 04:52:36
Just wait a few days, we'll be moaning and growling.

We need a grandma friendly MEW. Current one is Scarry as hell.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:14:14
Have an upvote. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:37:39
All they do is shit on bitcoin. That sub is more cringed than @_date: 2018-04-02 13:00:20
What do you expect from a scumbag. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:17:02
So what if they get out? More for the rest of us. In the new world, crypto don't give a fuck about your family name or the old money it's associated with.

Correct. The sugar industry has its paws in everything. There is sugar in products you wouldn't think to have any sugar. People are addicted to certain products specifically because of the added sugar without knowing this is done intentionally to keep you coming back for more.

Good to see the Monopoly gal in there again
@_date: 2018-04-11 00:51:27
How can any government ban you from accepting bitcoin? This ain’t China.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:26:34
Let’s start one. They deserve it! A coin as prominent as BCash should have its own Wikipedia page. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 01:43:03
Guys we've been terrible, let's show CNBC proper terminology. Can we get a sticky with all the terms they need to know. I'll leave it up to you to be creative ��������

I'm in rural Japan and see zero shops accepting Bitcoin. By rural I mean 400k people city.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:03:21
Fucking moneybags Roger.
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:11:04
Bitcoin, bears, Battlestar Galactica. Am I doing it right?
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:07:54
Ah, this meme again. About time.
@_date: 2018-04-27 03:38:00
Waaaaaaaa! Babiesssssss!!!!
@_date: 2018-04-12 05:11:48
Sir, why make me lawl?
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:30:41
You can’t “claim” to be bitcoin just because you registered bitcoin.com and claim x y and z. Once you fork, you create your own identity and should go by such identity instead of trying to pass for something else. It’s great if you love BCH and if in your mind it’s better than btc but have the fucking decency to forge your own path to adoption. Don’t mooch of bitcoin.

Bilderberg ain't got nuttin on Bitcoin! W0rd

Private crypto at that.

Sugar is the biggest drug everyone consumes and not aware of. Try quitting sugar and see how long that lasts...

I like to imagine someone out there shit their pants and told everyone how they got a bunch of bitcoin at 3.99 each ������
