Well i think the fact that visa averages 2000 transactions per second and can handle up to 50k and bitcoin only does 7 should be pretty alarming too! It literally cannot handle being a currency and as such i dont see how unless something changes that itll be anything more than a commodity

[google search](                                                                 [google seach2]( This is just to give an idea from a quick google search. Obviously you are right and itll depend on several factors like you listed hints the range you’ll see but nowhere will you find it costing $17k to mine. This also hints why the costs of a lot of graphics cards have been inflated over the last year or so compared to the historical norms (China and Russia have been buying them up).

I’ve seen a few articles and the intrinsic value is in the range of $500-$2000 because thats the cost to mine 1 bitcoin. Think of it currently as a commodity as it shouldn’t really have much value above the intrinsic value (because less than 1% is actually being used as a currency and 99% is being used as speculation). I know people will prly downvote this because bitcoin is meant to takeover the world but i think something to really remember is bitcoin is not blockchain bitcoin is meant to be a currency but currently cant transact anything close to what a currency needs to.

Think this is more than likely a bull trap no reason for bitcoin to be going up but several issues yet to be resolved to drag it down further...

Yea not sure if bull trap before real crash

Yea could be right just watched it rocket up some again and was about to say seems more like manipulation now than a bull trap.
