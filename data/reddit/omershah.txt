This is the wrong thinking; remember bitcoin itself hasn't changed in value. Its only changed in relation to USD. With the current dip in USDvBTC price he's actually getting paid more all of a sudden. His employers $3400 or w/e a month is turning into much more BTC than before. So for him its a pay raise all of a sudden. 
We need to decouple our thinking from valuing bitcoin only in USD to 1 btc = 1 btc.

You're yelling at someone who owns bitcoins dude; do you really think you're going to change their mind? People don't want to believe they've bought into a scam, there are still people holding their beanie babies wishing they'll come back in value one day.

I'm interested in bitcoin; is that wallet stored locally though or on their side? I'm just affraid of all the exit scams you hear about and I'm incredibly poor so losing any amount of money would be devestating for me. I make fun of bitcoin a lot mainly because I don't get it but having learnt more I'm thinking of starting a wallet with a small amount ... I just don't want to take a risk.

To be fair pedophiles do use bitcoin to trade child porn so its not that far off.
