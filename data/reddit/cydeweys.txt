Who would *know* that they're buying colored coins?  I'm not going to bother consulting a blacklist for every transaction that I do.  Especially considering that the blacklist would grow without bounds as the attacker continually shuffled coins around and split them across a large number of addresses.  You could easily end up with a blacklist in the millions of addresses if the attacker spent only some very small percentage of his proceeds on tx fees (way less than 1%) -- and at that point, who do we even trust to maintain such a blacklist?  It'd have to be some central authority.
Plus, there's always mixing and gambling sites.  Unless everyone unanimously agrees to the blockade -- which won't happen! -- it's eventually going to end up mixing in anyway.

Do we know what the integration between the two would look like then?  Would the Lightning Network client spit out an address to send funds to to open a channel?  Or maybe you'd give it the private key of an address holding funds, it'd spit out a transaction opening the channel, and then you'd broadcast that transaction through the Bitcoin Core software?
This really needs to be as nice and easy as possible.  A single client handling it all would be ideal.  Awesome to hear that Electrum is going down that route; I'll have to take a look.

Do you have an argument other than "LOL"?  The point of Bitcoin is that security and consensus is provided in a distributed fashion by having a large number of miners that cannot easily be overpowered.  Network effects thus tend to dominate, and there are good reasons for using the largest one.  Look at all of the altcoins that [were successfully 51% attacked]( because their networks were tiny.  No one in their right minds would use those for anything important.

Why are they still repeating this lie?  Do they really think anyone is buying it?  The bug was very clearly within their *own* system.  No other Bitcoin site that I'm aware of lost anything due to issues surrounding transaction malleability.  At the most some of them had to temporarily suspend BTC withdrawals while they verified that everything was functioning correctly (it was).  If you're the *only* ones who fucked something up, and everyone else was fine, it's pretty clear where the real blame lies, despite repeated claims to the contrary.

I don't understand why there's so much negativity here.  This is a very easy technical problem to solve (unlike, say, the problem of &gt;50% pools).  Hell, Namecoin itself is already a proof of concept.  All you'd need is a simpler version of Namecoin, without the automatic expiry.  You write and sign a transaction/message that gets distributed on the network.  It's signed by the private key associated with the Bitcoin address to be used, and the contents of the signed message are the username.  Then that's in the blockchain.  That's it.
As a fresh client fires up and downloads the blockchain, it keeps track of all of these username establishment transactions/messages, and writes them to a dictionary.  Boom.  Now if I send money to "CydeWeys", my client simply looks up what address corresponds to that, and sends it to that address.  You could even do easy revocation a la GPG keys so that if anyone else gets access to your private keys, you can at least revoke that username so no one will mistakenly send funds to it in the future.
@_date: 2014-02-23 17:55:58
Yes, but the inflexibility of the mandatory approach would deter most hardcore users, who are trading in much higher volumes, and thus are much more profitable, than the casuals. There's no way an exchange is going to lock down withdrawals to a fixed address at account creation for all users. 
Actually, it might well hurt casual users more than experienced users. I run my own wallet, so I don't need to worry about receiving funds. A fixed address would be fine, albeit it would expose my total balance. But casual users and Web wallets? They'd never be able to change Web wallets, and some of them don't indefinitely associate given receiving addresses with a single account anyway. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 13:20:38
To expand on what others have said, the &gt;50% attack allows you to "undo" transactions you originated, nothing else.  Since you don't particularly gain anything out of undoing other people's transactions, the main way this is used is to write a transaction giving your BTC in exchange for something else, taking ownership of that something, and then undoing your payment.
\&gt;50% attack does not allow you to authorize fraudulent transactions.  You'd need to break some very heavy duty public-key cryptography in order to do that, which we is much, much, much, much less likely than taking control of &gt;50% of the network.
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:40:42
I limit my exposure to exchanges by keeping my funds deposited for an absolute minimum amount of time (just long enough to exchange and then withdraw them).  Everyone else should be doing the same.  The people who kept funds in MtGox for extended periods of time were not protecting themselves to the maximum extent possible.

To expand on this, go look at the chart of difficulty increases [here](  Between Oct 6 and Oct 26, 2013, the difficulty level went up *twice*, once by 41.45%, the second time by 46.02%.  Multiply those two together and you have an increase of 106.5% -- so Bitcoin's network more than doubled in less than 20 days, which is a much more impressive figure than the 40 cited in the title.
Most of Bitcoin's network hashrate growth has come from improvements in mining technology.  The first generation ASICs were, what, 50 GH/s for a large miner?  And now the newest generation ones are &gt;2 TH/s?

Granted it's possible that you might defeat custom hardware for a span of years, but thanks to Moore's Law, at some point in the future custom hardware is going to become better at any arbitrary task than today's general purpose processors.  Making the crypto more memory-intensive just pushes that date farther into the future (and thus possibly more disruptive when it does finally happen).  There's no way to prevent it.  Computation is computation.

That guy is probably paying something like 5 cents per KW-hr or less.  It depends on the total efficiency of his rigs, but assuming 1 GH/s/W, the Bitcoin exchange rate would still have to come way, way down for him to be unprofitable (to a level of 14 USD/BTC in fact, using the current difficulty level).
The more salient question is, at what point does the profitability equation dip enough such that it is no longer profitable to invest in additional mining hardware, and I believe we're at that point now.  Any mining hardware that is denominated in USD is not going to hit ROI at 440 USD/BTC unless the difficulty factor flattens out (which is very unlikely).

I tried to spend Bitcoin at a food truck in DC recently.  No go.  They'd been having issues with whatever payment processor they were using (BitPay maybe?) and since so few people were spending Bitcoin anyway, they didn't have much of an incentive to get it working.

I'm with you that the total Bitcoin transaction volume is probably severely overstated.  What worries me is the transaction *count*.  Bitcoin handles an order of magnitude fewer transactions per unit time than Western Union.  Could Bitcoin even handle having that many transactions?  Or would the blocks fill up before then?  We already know that it couldn't come close to handling the transaction volume of Visa, which is three and a half order of magnitudes higher!
@_date: 2014-04-07 23:35:37
I'm still not understanding why I care about the balances of others.


Huh?  I have exactly the amount of BTC I'd be withdrawing.  What do you mean "more" or "less"?  How can you withdraw more BTC than you have?  If you can withdraw X amount BTC, then that's how much you have, and the audit will verify that.
If you're referring to holding USD and exchanging it for BTC at some point in the future, then yeah, auditing the amount of fiat held in reserves is beyond the scope of any sort of Bitcoin audit, and cannot be accomplished by any means save a trusted third party with access to all relevant bank accounts.  But you can certainly audit your BTC, which is all you need.


This doesn't matter, because if everyone audits their own BTC, then all BTC will be accounted for.  Only a small fraction of the active users even have to audit their amounts regularly; if *any* goes missing, someone who is auditing will raise the alarm bells, and then everyone will know.  So you don't need to see all balances, only your own, and then you know that other people can all see their own as well, and you know that the exchange is solvent.


Transaction fees are, what, $0.0045 as of v0.9?  Transaction fees are nothing.  They're way, way smaller than what the exchange charges you as a commission.  And if they help to discourage day trading with small amounts at stake, well then good.


*This* is the part that concerns me.  I don't have a good solution to it.  If you don't mind exchange withdrawals taking a little while, it's possible to imagine an airgapped manual batch process that runs once a day wherein withdrawals are verified and then signed on a non-network-attached computer.  Personally I'd be OK with that, but I know a lot of people wouldn't be.  I don't have another good solution that would allow fractional cold storage but not fractional reserves while still having simple self-auditing but not total auditing.
@_date: 2014-02-24 23:09:36


And it's important to point out that this could be rectified in a future patch without breaking something fundamental in the Bitcoin protocol.  If, say, version 0.9 doubled the precision on this field, and then 100 years down the line we finally hit the point where mining started reaching the limits of that precision, how many people would still be affected given that the incompatible version was a century out of date?
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:13:07


Actually that's very "fortunate" (or one might say, intentional according to the protocol).  If you could brute-force your own keys you could just as easily brute-force anyone else's, and then of course Bitcoin would be useless.

After that breach it was clear that Gox was never to be trusted again.

This approach will never work because of one simple reason: Moore's Law.  Custom hardware is going to get better over time, eventually eclipsing what any modern general purpose computing hardware can accomplish.
Hypothetically, let's say that you had created a cryptocurrency in 2000 that was designed to only be computable on a general-purpose computer as available back in that day.  Well ... it'd easily be handled by an ASIC now.  The inevitable march of technological advancement is working against you if you're trying to place limitations on what can and cannot be done.

As long as they have some edge in power-efficiency, they will reach the point where they will push GPU miners into the point of negative returns once power consumption is factored in, and then GPU mining will die, same as happened with Bitcoin.  Yes, maybe they only end up being (I'm entirely making up numbers here, and I'm being pessimistic to boot) 20X as efficient with power instead of 1000X as efficient as with Bitcoin, but that's still easily enough to push GPU miners entirely out of the realm of profitability.

Yes, they are provably fair, using pretty much the same mathematics (and usually the exact same hash algorithms) that allows Bitcoin itself to work in the first place.  It's not just that you can verify that the total outcome matches the odds; it's that you can verify the integrity of *each* bet.  Thus it doesn't matter what the owners may or may not be doing with their own bets, since your bet is independent and you can independently verify its outcome.

Bank transfers in the US are notoriously difficult.  I had one landlord once who preferred it and it was a huge mess.  I couldn't initiate a bank transfer to an account that wasn't mine through the bank's website (and this wasn't a small bank), so I'd have to go to the bank's physical branch each month, wait in line, write out an account transfer statement (I had an account at the same bank), and process it through the cashier.
At my next place my landlord accepted checks in the mail, which was much preferable.
Also, the bank transfer setup is a pull system instead of a push system, so if you know someone's account number you can pretty easily steal money from them by endorsing fraudulent checks, money transfers, and similar.  To keep yourself safe as a landlord you'll want a different business account for each tenant to pay into (which costs money), and you'll want to move the money out of those accounts as soon as it comes in to reduce risk.  It's a huge mess, and Bitcoin would be much better.

There's the rub though.  If you wanted to rewrite a large number of blocks, not only would you need &gt;50% of the computing power, but you'd need a large amount of time in which to build your independent blockchain, without broadcasting it, and without people realizing that they'd been compromised.  Say you do compromise the two largest pools, and you thus get 60% of the hashing power of the network.  If you wanted to rewrite a day's worth of blocks, it would take *five* more days of calculation off-chain to win over, because the differential of the 60% over the rest of the 40% of the network is only .2, and to overtake the initial full day lead you'd thus need 5 days on average.  And people would absolutely notice if 60% of the hashing power disappeared and went off-grid.

A lot of people aren't able to properly calculate ROI.  The top two Google search results for "Bitcoin mining calculator" do not correctly handle increasing difficulty levels.  They're actually quite misleading in that sense.

Wow ... dude, you don't know how databases work.  Databases typically store data on *disk* (if you didn't, you'd lose all of your data if the power went out).  Yes, having a lot of system memory and keeping as much of the data in memory as possible will improve performance, but memory isn't the system of record for databases.
If you don't believe me, you can [read up on one of the file formats using by MySQL]( for storing its data on disk.

That won't work -- if the currency truly takes off, you'll experience a tragedy of the commons effect where more and more people want to mine, but all of these people joining will increase the difficulty level to the point that commodity hardware is no longer capable (e.g. it might push the memory requirements into realms that only servers with 8 DIMM slots can handle).  Now you're in a situation where only people with serious, expensive hardware can mine, so the hash rate plummets while the difficulty level remains the same and never really reaches the next adjustment, and you enter a death spiral.

There's no risk to not paying the fee.  If you don't pay a fee and that tx never makes it into the blockchain, those coins aren't gone.  You can reuse them (until a tx spending them does make it into the blockchain).  Yes, this is slightly difficult with the default wallet app, but that's just details.

What we really need is a list of all addresses that MtGox has coins in, then we can find out how much BTC they actually have left according to the blockchain.

That doesn't make any sense to me.  If you started with 10 BTC, then sold it for USD, then bought on a dip, and now you have 12 BTC, then *you have 12 BTC*, and you would expect to see 12 BTC for your address in the Merkle hash tree.  I'm not understanding what scenario you're envisioning where you have an amount other than the amount that you have.  Can you explain in more detail?


They wouldn't get away with it if users compared their hashes with each others and verified no duplicates (thanks to the birthday problem, you wouldn't need too many users publishing their amounts before a collision becomes likely), but I see your point here; it's easier to verify if the exchange simply publishes hashes for all addresses.

Transferring money is almost never instantaneous here; it usually takes at least a day to clear, sometimes more if it's across banks.  Services like Western Union that charge outrageous fees are popular here for a reason (also for remittances).
As for why our banks don't allow it, I don't really know.  It would clearly be a win from the consumer perspective.  I think the reason it's better in Europe is that European regulations require much more customer-friendliness from banks than our regulations do.  We don't pay transaction fees on ACH transfers (what we call bank transfers), though we do pay pretty hefty wire transfer fees on wire transfers, which admittedly are more rare, although I did need to use a wire transfer to buy my house.  It doesn't cost anything to *use* a check, but you do need to buy checks, and depending on who you buy them from they can be pretty expensive; some people will spend up to $0.50 per check on a book of checks.
I pay all of my bills using auto-pay.  I've entered my bank account information with all of my utility, credit card, and loan providers and they automatically deduct the amount using ACH transfer every month.  So it's not hard to pay bills electronically; it's just hard to send money to some random bank account.  Note that these institutions all use the "pull" method (you give them your info and they pull from your account).  Bitcoin and the person-to-person transfer you describe as having in your country use the "push" method, and that isn't well supported here.
When I was much younger I used to have to write checks on a monthly basis to pay my bills, but now I only very infrequently write checks, usually only when I owe money to my parents (e.g. because they bought a group of plane tickets for travel arrangements and I'm paying them back), or when I'm ordering something through the mail.
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:19:20
Although the problem can be mitigated somewhat by sitting on payouts for a bit and sending them out in batches that pay to many addresses simultaneously.  A lot of mining pool payouts are made in this fashion.  [Here's]( an example of what that looks like: That's a BTC Guild payment.  Note that 0.01 BTC is the minimum payout amount on BTC Guild, hence why a lot of the receiving addresses are receiving that amount (those users have configured their account with the lowest possible auto-payout amount).  If you batch up payments in this manner, you don't need to split your coins as much.

Well it's the free market at work here.  Banks aren't required to make it easy to transfer money into their competitors, so they don't.  They all want to keep you using their own various services and offerings.
Secondly, the poor state of banking in the US makes Bitcoin a bigger win relatively speaking than it is in Europe, which might increase adoption here.  If you have widespread apps that allow people to seamlessly do bank account transfers, then the average person doesn't need Bitcoin so much.  We're just starting to get those apps, and they're provided by Silicon Valley start-ups, not banks, so people have to go out of their way to find them and use them.

That calculation is off by about a factor of ten.  It would cost around $90-100M at current retail prices to equal the current Bitcoin network hashing power.  As a simple calculation, say we need 43,000 TH/s to achieve &gt;50%.  We'll use [Antminers]( which sell for $440 and put out 0.18 TH/s each.  So you need 43,000/0.18*$440 = $105M.  Of course, Antminers aren't the most cost-efficient miners out there.  If you managed to get your hands on [enough of these]( you'd bring that total figure down to $90M.
Point is, it's very cheap to duplicate the entire Bitcoin mining network.  Startlingly so.  The only thing stopping it is that that much spare mining hardware simply doesn't exist.  You'd need a new, *major* player to enter the game, who'd be able to create hardware comparable to the other ASIC miners available, but more of it than all other manufacturers combined.  That's a tall order to fill, though if a huge player such as Intel were to get into it, it'd by no means be impossible.

Yeah.  And problems with a dodgy exchange != problems with Bitcoin.  I did my research when I wanted to exchange some Bitcoins for cash, and it was very easy to discover that MtGox has a history of problems, and at the time that I was trying to sell BTC they already had a several week lead time on withdrawals in USD.  Obviously that was unacceptable to me, so I went with Coinbase, and I experienced no problems.  I never would even consider keeping any money/Bitcoins in any exchange for longer than absolutely necessary to finish selling them.

How is it a good thing that he keeps Bitcoins?  Economies don't function when people sit on currency stashes instead of creating further transactions.  See [fiscal multiplier](
Ideally you'd want someone who turns around and spends their BTC directly for goods from their suppliers.  But them turning it into fiat (where it then goes on to a trader, who may transact with it further) is still better than sitting on it.

Bitcoin has several fundamental improvements to offer that existing currencies do not.  None of the altcoins improve upon Bitcoin in any fundamental way, and they all have one significant downside -- that they are not nearly as widely used as Bitcoin is.  It's the decentralized part of the currency that matters.  Bitcoin was the first to offer that up and it gained a large marketshare.  None of the other changes in altcoins (different hash algos, block finding times, etc.) amount to anything other than noise when put up against the much larger issue of (a) not having come first, and thus (b) not having nearly as many users.

Ideally the solvency audit should be fully automatic and published daily (at a minimum).  There's no reason you couldn't continuously keep up to date a Merkle tree for all of an exchange's private addresses, thus allowing any random holder of funds at the exchange to verify their amounts at any time.

BTC Guild and Eligius have had this forever, though, granted, they are mining pools, not exchanges.
Personally I prefer two-factor auth, because locking down your withdrawal address is not always ideal.  You don't necessarily want all of your BTC at a single address, because it reveals how much is held by a single person.  Also, it's incompatible with having hot wallets and cold wallets (although that could be solved by allowing the input of multiple addresses and then locking them all down, then when a future withdrawal is done it can only go to one of the locked addresses).

@_date: 2014-02-25 01:18:55
It's not that dire.  There are many wallets out there that already adjust the fees on their outgoing transactions based on how saturated the network is with existing transactions.  If you go on Blockchain Explorer and look for long periods of time (say, 40 minutes or more) in which no blocks were mined, you'll see that the transaction fees on the next block are much higher.  The miner had their pick of the litter on those, and naturally picked the transactions with the highest fees.
So the network is already resilient to this kind of attack.

I think the way it would have to work is scaled off of block number, not difficulty level.  The size of the network is irrelevant; what you're protecting against is technological progress in computing power over time.  The block number is the only thing that increases predictably over time (thanks to the freely adjusting difficulty level).  So you'd want to calibrate your memory footprint increases to roughly scale over time in lockstep with Moore's Law or the equivalent for memory density; for instance, if there is one block found roughly every 10 minutes, then you'll want your memory footprint to double every 105,120 blocks, which corresponds to two years' worth of blocks.  Of course the problem here is that your calibration needs to be exact, and if we run into any unanticipated events that deviate from the law, in either direction, then things will go haywire.  For example, we could either discover a groundbreaking new memory technology, or we could stall out further development in the face of quantum tunneling.  Who knows?  All I know is that, in 1899, no one could've reasonably predicted when a Moon landing would occur.

It's important to point out that since equipment costs are sunk costs, miners only drop out if the reward falls below the cost of electricity.  This is unlikely to happen at half of the current price level, so you won't see a drop-off of hashing power at the halvening (we didn't the last time either).

It's always been this way though.  In the past, when hashrate was growing at a faster rate, the electricity price time horizon was even nearer than the 88-240 days figure you quoted.  The halvening isn't special in this regard.  The reason that hashrate keeps going up is that successive generations of mining equipment are more energy efficient, and this has always been the case.  When you decide to buy equipment, you are factoring in the difficulty increases, and you simply don't buy it if it won't ever pay for itself before running it becomes uneconomical due to power costs.  This is a natural economic force here in play that thus keeps the hashrate below the point of negative returns for those with cheap power.

Negative, 51% hashpower does not win if that hashpower is wasted on invalid blocks that disobey consensus rules and are thus ignored.  I could spend hundreds of millions of dollars on mining hardware to reach 51% hash rate and go mine blocks with a block reward of 50 BTC and it wouldn't affect the network one whit -- everyone would simply ignore those invalid blocks.  There are dozens of different ways you could change things up in order to make invalid blocks that will get ignored; using a non-accepted block size is simply one of many.
@_date: 2016-03-01 01:48:23


Average confirmation time should be exactly *ten* minutes.  The reason that it isn't is because the network hashrate has been increasing over time as more miners are added to the network, so that at any given instant, the instantaneous hashrate is higher than the average of the past 2,016 blocks that determined the current difficulty rate.
So you absolutely need to control before network hashrate before you go about positing alternative explanations for slower confirmation times like blocks getting full.  And what do you know ... [the network hashrate]( fell over exactly that timeline that you noticed the increase in average confirmation time.  I don't feel like busting out statistics right now, but it looks to me like the vast majority, if not the entirety, of the increased average confirmation time is caused solely by changes in network hashrate.

This is exactly why a rational actor *wouldn't* do it.  Miners only bother buying all that hardware and burning all that electricity because Bitcoins have value.  It is not in their self-interest to successfully take over all mining activities by forcing others out if the cost is that what they are mining becomes valueless because people no longer trust the system.  Bitcoin's value will absolutely *plummet* if this argument cannot be resolved, and the majority hashrate miners continually attack the majority economic consensus chain to kill it.  In such a situation the miners would make much more money simply by choosing to mine on the majority economic consensus chain instead.  That would be the rational choice.

The one bit of signal that's being lost in all the noise is a request for proof-of-reserves.  I think that's entirely reasonable, and I would encourage Coinbase to do it.  Unfortunately it's getting completely lost in a fog of unsubstantiated accusations.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:43:22


Yeah, that's my main question.  I want to know what exactly that graph is actually showing, but there's no implementation details on the page like there should be.  Absent those, it's very hard to say if the graph is actually useful or representative of "true" transaction activity.


Mixers wouldn't (shouldn't) do that, as it doesn't do anything to obscure the actual source/destination of a coin.  It would make much more sense to send it through a long sequence of new addresses (which are free), which this wouldn't detect.  There's no reason you wouldn't use a new address for every single transaction, so the same addresses being used repeatedly in a long chain is really just a measure of someone doing something stupid or purposely spammy.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:39:41
It's not that I "don't get it", it's that multiple claims are being advanced with no supporting evidence.  The right thing to do in such a situation is to ask for evidence.  Don't put this on me.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:01:34
I understand its intent, but I don't understand how exactly it's implemented.  What is a "chain longer than 100"?
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:03:21
This argument makes more sense to me as well.  I still don't think small vs large block has anything to do with the competency or solvency of Coinbase, and no one has provided any actual evidence.
@_date: 2016-06-10 18:16:17
It doesn't necessarily need to be done in the same block though; with enough of a starting stock you could easily have enough coins moving around to only move any given coin once per day (let alone multiple times per block), yet still inflate the transaction count by thousands per day.
Higher fees are the single best way for clearing up this kind of mirage.
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:05:59
This is veering deeply into unsubstantiated ad hominem territory.  Is Coinbase really failing?  Do you have any evidence?  I don't think there's much of a connection between user base and block size, especially for a large centralized service like Coinbase that can do a lot of its transactions off-chain.
Has Coinbase always lied?  What specifically are you referring to?  If they aren't one of the leaders in this space ... then who is?  As far as I'm concerned, they and BitPay are the "face" of Bitcoin to casual users.  Every time I've bought something online using Bitcoin from a retailer, it's always using one of those two.
You are using lots of strong invective without backing it up that goes against my personal experiences.
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:30:34
How about if it's sent between three addresses?  Is that filtered out too?
How many transactions are there that really send the same coin back and forth between the same addresses over a hundred times anyway?  That seems ludicrous to do.  And with the current fees, it's not cheap either.
@_date: 2017-08-01 22:49:27


That's exactly what worries me.  The people who spend lots of time making racist jokes online likely are racist, they just can't be openly racist so they hide it underneath a veneer of "humor" (though many people, especially the targeted minorities, don't find it funny).  I have no doubt that many of these people would simply be openly racist rather than jokingly racist if it were a century ago and being openly racist were more societally acceptable.  But the constant "joking" is helping to move the window to where it is seen as more acceptable.
It's a worrisome time.  It feels like global freedom and civil rights are on the wane.

What do hardforks have to do with anything?  I'm genuinely curious.
I still use Coinbase occasionally to sell Bitcoin, but I only hold BTC in the account for the minimum number of confirmations required to be able to sell it.  And I also don't sell large amounts at any one time, so I wouldn't suffer an irrecoverable loss if Coinbase happened to go bankrupt during one of my transactions.  Coinbase seems to have the best selling experience to me, so until someone else comes along and does better, I have no choice but to keep using it.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:47:27
I still don't see what that has to do with this particular comment thread, which is about Coinbase allegedly lying about the number of Bitcoins they hold in storage.  Sure, the hardfork arguments are a well-trodden path, but I don't see how they're applicable *here*.

@_date: 2017-08-19 15:31:25
That's a pro, but the con is that it reduces overall transaction throughput.  If you only get one block every 10 minutes on average, but some of those are empty, then you're really only getting one actually useful block less often than every 10 minutes on average.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:05:43
And of the remaining half, 90% are *still* signaling. You would need all at least 80% to leave, exclusively from the signaling group, to have a non-signaling majority amongst the remaining few.

That seems like a feature not a bug, though. An old signed transaction from the main chain should *not* be valid on a new hard-fork chain, as the person who authored the transaction likely did not intend for it to valid on a not-yet-invented hard-fork.

You are aware that the Nazis killed tens of millions of people too, right?  They're not exactly some fictional boogeyman.  You also don't seem to have a long-term perspective.

Each checking account is a hassle to open though.  I think the idea with LN channels is that they are envisioned to become as easy to open as sending a Bitcoin transaction currently is.
You can even imagine running some kind of batch script or configuration file to open up a bunch of LN channels simultaneously.  Definitely can't open checking accounts that easily.

How about "it seems like an obvious omission to not have the GUI ready for segwit activation".  I get that it's probably not as high a priority for the devs, as they're perfectly comfortable using the command-line, but it'd have been nice to have available for general users from day one.  There's an incentive right now to use segwit because it means your transaction fees will be lower, but it's not easy for anyone to use segwit quite yet, so most transactions still aren't taking advantage of it.

I was just at this past DEF CON, and it was *packed*.  Something like 27K attendees, most of whom were from the US.  There's clearly a very large demand for such conferences in the US, so moving them all overseas is an obvious non-starter.  If you already live in the US anyway, which *most of the attendees do*, then there isn't any additional risk from going to the conference, because the feds could just as easily pick you up at your home if they had a reason to.

90% period.  You aren't doing math correctly.  If 90% of a population is in support of something, and then a random half of that population leaves, the remaining half of that population is still 90% in support.  You don't just divide it by half like that.
If 90% of Americans are for something, then does that mean that NYC (which has ~2% of the US population) is only 1.8% of it?  Absolutely not.

Most wallets expose the choice of fee as satoshis per byte.  So the fee *is* less for a smaller transaction (i.e. bech32 address), for the same confirmation speed.  If you keep the overall fee constant but use a larger transaction, then it will be confirmed slower, and if you dip below 1 sat/byte, it may never be confirmed.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:15:11
Seriously.  Some transactions are super time dependent, and others aren't.  Sometimes you're just consolidating your outputs for future spending and you don't care if it takes days to confirm.  Other times you need the transaction to confirm *now*, because you're buying something online, you need to get it in an exchange to trade it, or any other time-dependent reason.  If you need it to confirm now then you often need to pay significantly more than 1 sat/vbyte.  The market swings over a few seconds on even a moderate amount of BTC can easily eclipse the transaction fee.

One of the main points of segwit is to enable layer 2 solutions, which we are going to need to support massive transaction scales.  Simply multiplying the max block size by a small integer doesn't get us meaningfully closer to supporting massive scaling.

Hashing power is the only fair way to have a vote.
How else would you do it?  There's no way to measure a distinct user, or a distinct holder of Bitcoin, or a distinct amount.  You can easily fake "users" by creating more receiving addresses, and you can move Bitcoin to create volume to look like a big player.
There's no other proposal that works.
Miners that use a pool are effectively casting their vote to the mining pool to make further decisions on their behalf, like representative democracy.  If a miner doesn't like the stance that a pool takes on any given issue, they should switch to a different pool more aligned with their views (analogous to elected political offices).

Actually, yes, in the same sense that any alternate to US currency within the US is shit too.  See what happened to the [Liberty Dollar]( for instance (ignoring that it was illegal).  Check out [Gresham's Law]( which is a widely accepted theory in economics.  Basically, if there's two currencies that are roughly interchangeable (as Bitcoin and any altcoin are), even slight differences in value and acceptability will magnify over time, strengthening the one that is already stronger and weakening the one that is already weaker.
And that's *ignoring* the issues of network security, which are also relevant to Bitcoin in a way that aren't relevant to non-distributed-digital currencies.

Now you're talking about something different though.  The context of the current situation is dealing with the spamming.  People choosing higher fees solves that.  Have software do it by default and it solves it for pretty much everyone.

The mempool is a local phenomenon.  It's dependent on all sorts of things, like which transactions were relayed to you (and in what order), how long your node has been running, how many connections to other nodes you have and what their acceptance policies are, and other stuff.

Goddammit.  I've been waiting for GUI support for segwit for what feels like forever, and now it's slipped again?!  Stupid B2X.
The current best way to increase the transaction throughput of the blockchain is to make using segwit easier and the default.  We can't possibly say that's been accomplished until the biggest client handles it.  Once it does, then those segwit adoption graphs should go up a bit more.
@_date: 2017-04-22 21:51:31

He probably does have that much in debt, including things like mortgages on his homes.  He's phrasing it in a very deceptive way however; he probably has way more total in assets, including the value of said homes.

The spammers would have to follow the same advice too, making their attack twice as costly.  I don't particularly mind paying a few more cents to have a transaction go through.  The attackers probably do mind having to spend tens of thousands of dollars more per day, or whatever the figure works out to.
@_date: 2012-12-10 22:58:54
Yeah, seriously.  Everyone focuses on the fee as if it's somehow meaningful.  It's not.  It's a few cents at most.  And yet people develop elaborate schemes to prevent paying even the tiniest fee by coming up with complicated transactions involving unnecessarily large inputs.  It's crazy.
Here's the fee number that matters: 2.9%.  That's what PayPal charges.  If you were buying something for $100,000 with PayPal, PayPal's take would be $2,900.30.  If you were buying something with Bitcoin, the fee would probably be free, but at most, would be a few cents.  That's nowhere close to being in the same ballpark.

I have an almost identical setup to this, except the graphics cards are laid out differently, which is a huge cooling benefit.

The wooden skeleton I built to support the cards was free to me (just some scrap wood I had laying around that I attached together with screws).
As a result of this layout, the hottest card is running at around 65-68degC, while the coolest one is running sub-60.  I have all of my cards overclocked to 975/335, which puts out 311 MHash/s each.  Oh, and not seen in the picture above is a huge 24" box fan that's pointed at the rig.

I'll follow along and point out precisely where you went off the rails:


Good so far.


Somewhat, but not necessarily.  The price would have to go down by enough to cause people who are presently mining rigs to shut them off and sell them.  If it only decreases by a bit new rigs will be unprofitable but running existing rigs will remain profitable, so you might reach a point of stability on the mining.




Not at all!  Where in the world did you get this from?  Remember that the only thing difficulty does is act as a scaling factor so that the amount of Bitcoins entering the system is constant.  Difficulty is a decoupling mechanism that ensures that network hashing capacity and supply are *independent*.  There is no mechanism by which difficulty decreasing creates a higher price.


True, but since the supposition of this, that lower difficulty creates better price, is false, it's irrelevant.

Very true.  Entries in a distributed database don't put food on the table unless people accept them in exchange for food.  And why would anyone accept these Biocoins, which aren't backed by anything, have an infinitely expanding supply, and that everyone gets for free?  The only reason anyone would accept them would if the government compelled merchants to accept them (i.e. by buying them back from merchants at a set value of actual money, like how food stamps work).
But if the government is mandating this acceptance, it implies the largest kind of centralization that there is (national government), so why bother using a Bitcoin-like system in the first place?  Just write everyone a basic living stipend check every two weeks and be done with it.

It's completely random, and there's no way to know.  The SHA256^2 hashing function used by Bitcoin, by being 1-way, is effectively generating a level of randomness that is completely indistinguishable from random rolls of completely fair dice.

You realize that most fiat currencies don't have anything to prop them up with real value in a "genuine way" either, right?  Fiat currencies only have value because you can use them to buy things and pay your debts.  Obviously, Bitcoin isn't nearly as widespread yet, but you can already use it to buy a variety of things, and the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin is increasing daily.  I've already done several transactions online with other end users of Bitcoin (*not* merchants) -- selling Steam games, buying used DVDs, etc.  Bitcoin was a much superior choice for these transactions than any of the alternatives such as PayPal, which offer much higher fees and don't work as well internationally.

You're talking about it from a myopic miner's perspective.  The difficulty level increasing is a good thing.  That means that more people are mining, the network is growing larger, and as a result the security of the network is growing stronger as well (as you would need a larger amount of computing power to take over &gt;50% of the total hashing capacity).
If the difficulty level ever does go down several times in a row, the most likely cause will be that Bitcoin is on its deathbed.

To be fair, though, the unspoken assumption in your title, when made explicit, reads as follows:
"The 100 most powerful Supercomputers in the world all combined are only as powerful as 25.98% of the Bitcoin Network, at doing Bitcoin operations."
The supercomputers would beat the pants off of the Bitcoin network at many other sorts of operations, including floating point operations and all sorts of highly connected simulations that need massive amounts of data transfer between computational nodes.  In some sense the Bitcoin network can't even be compared to a supercomputer because every individual hash is a completely separate event, whereas a supercomputer can handle massively intertwined calculations, such as a physical simulation of weather, or a nuclear bomb going off, or particle interactions.
The supercomputers are very generalized and highly connected.  The Bitcoin network is much more specific (it's composed nearly 100% of GPUs, which aren't good for computations that involve branching), and it's very spread out.  You couldn't do anything that was very data-intensive with the Bitcoin network; Internet transfer speeds and latencies don't come close to cutting it.

The main thing I was arguing against was your assertion that a higher difficulty level drives a higher price.  Are you still claiming this or have you given that up?  If you're giving that up it's possible we might be in agreement.
My main thesis here is that difficulty exists as a decoupling mechanism between network mining size and rate of increase in supply such that the supply will increase at a constant rate regardless of the number of miners (be there 10 on CPUs or 50,000 on GPUs).  Thus, since the number of available BTC is growing at a rate completely independently of *anything* that is going on with miners, there is no possible mechanism by which the difficulty level should affect price.  Price is set by supply and demand, neither of which are affected by difficulty level.
It is almost a tautology that the difficulty level cannot affect supply because its very existence is to keep the supply growing at a constant level, so you'll need to prove somehow that changes in difficulty level affect demand.  And short of adopting the discredited labor theory of value, I don't see any way you can do that.  What exactly *is* your thesis?
\* Note that the above comments are applicable to the medium term and longer, because the difficulty level works on a 2016 block window instead of being instantaneous.
@_date: 2011-07-07 23:52:20
They are optional, but so is a miner including a transaction in a block.  The default client uses a [priority calculation]( to determine the priority of transactions.  Larger transactions have more priority than smaller transactions, transactions with older coins have more priority than smaller transactions, and smaller (in kilobytes) transactions have more priority than larger transactions.  Below a certain priority value, the Bitcoind that the miner is running will not include a transaction in a block unless it has a fee on it.  Even better than that, normal network nodes won't even propagate transactions with low enough priority figures (the spammiest of the spammiest).  Now, since everyone is free to modify their own client, there are *some* people that are running Bitcoinds that will always include transactions in a block even without fees, but most will not!
The important thing to focus on is the second part of the priority calculation, the age of the coins.  This is what defeats spam.  Spammers would try to fill up the blockchain with lots of junk transactions over and over again, meaning they would be using the same *coins* over and over again.  Hence these transactions would all have low priorities and would just tend to get ignored, both by the miners and the normal network nodes.

The word "overkill" is completely meaningless here.  It's a library function, it takes a millisecond or less to execute.  And you need to run it, what, once per week, or however often the lottery occurs?  Why the hell would you waste *any* time trying to find the "optimal" hashing function to use here?  Bitcoin already has a good solution for generating *exactly* the 32 bits you desire.  Granted, it's done by grabbing 32 bits off a RIPEMD-160 hash (and not SHA256), but the principle is exactly the same: just use something that already exists.

Complete non sequitur.  I know exactly where 100% of my GPU cycles are going to when I mine Bitcoins -- computing SHA256 hashes to find a valid block.  That's not nefarious at all.
You may be making some kind of allusion to The Silk Road, but that'd be like saying that me working at my day job is nefarious, because somewhere down the road, someone might use the dollars I'm earning to buy drugs.  Except with Bitcoin there's a constant number of Bitcoins entering the system regardless of how many people are mining (thanks to the difficulty factor), so I'm *really* not affecting anything so far as "making coins to be used illegally" goes.  If anything, by planning to use the coins for non-illegal purposes, I'm decreasing the overall share of the pie that's going to illegal purpose, and I'm solidly in the moral right.
@_date: 2011-07-07 01:01:48


Cute, but I've given you point-by-point rebuttals of lots of things you've said.  I've repeatedly pointed out the gaps in your logic (such as the whole "better reward" detour) and shown how you aren't actually proving what you've set out to.  You have not demonstrated that difficulty has an effect on reward.  You have not demonstrated a credible mechanism by which it occurs.  We both agree that price affects difficulty, and the reasoning behind it can be expressed in a single indisputable sentence.  So why can you not do the same for difficulty affecting price?  And now you've just resorted to saying "Oh, I did it", and thinking that excuses you from actually doing it?  You can't even *link* me to a quick explanation of how difficulty affects price.
[Here]( is some further reading for you.  [This]( too.  And just to give you one for *your* side, here's [this](  It manages to, in a single sentence, propose a mechanism by which difficulty might affect price.  Let me quote it:  "As the difficulty increases, more potential investors will invest into bitcoins directly instead of mining, thus increasing the price."  That's more in a single sentence than you've managed to say in hundreds of sentences.
Now I happen to think that this sentence doesn't tell the whole story, for two reasons: (1) There isn't that much overlap between investors and miners, and (2) What really matters is not the raw difficulty figure in isolation, but rather, the ratio between price and difficulty, and thus the relative profitability of buying versus mining.  So this is actually the mechanic that causes price to drive difficulty -- the more profitable mining is, the more mining you have, the more difficulty goes up.  If this ratio doesn't favor mining, then you simply wouldn't choose to mine, or if the ratio really disfavors mining, you might choose to turn off and/or sell the mining rigs you're already running.  But I don't see how it would directly affect the price, because even though the difficulty level is "high", it's only high because there are lots of miners out there, and the sum total of them is still producing the same constant amount of Bitcoins per hour.
@_date: 2011-08-01 13:46:02


I'm in agreement here.  It wouldn't be hard at all to write in a transaction validation rule saying that transactions spending from transaction outputs that are older than, say, 1,000,000 blocks (about 20 years at 6 blocks/hour) are invalid.  So if you want to keep your money, at the very least you have to move it around once per twenty years.  That way you could solve the problem of (somewhat) knowing how many valid Bitcoins are in existence, because the window is only over the last 20 years, rather than all the way back to the beginning of Bitcoin with the first 1 or 2 million in mystery coins.

There are some problems with this.
(1)  How do you prevent illegitimate uses of the system (i.e. someone who just wants to crack a lot of passwords in a list of compromised password hashes).  I personally would not want my GPU cycles going towards nefarious ends.
(2)  It requires centralization.  Who is authorizing these tasks?  Where is the payment coming from?  The genius of the Bitcoin protocol is that it is 100% decentralized (save for initial seeds anyway).  In order to get computational problems on the network, and then get paid for them, you'd need centralization.
@_date: 2011-10-07 18:09:17
Yes to the Nth degree on point 2. Some kind of system that checks each recipient of "Biocoins" and verifies that they're real, unique people *requires* centralization.  So why bother using Bitcoin at all, which is very unnecessarily complex if you don't need it to be decentralized?
@_date: 2011-07-12 16:17:13


Very specifically, the reason it's not like cracking a password is because it uses a one-way hash.  There is no guaranteed mapping of any sort between inputs and outputs.  For a given set of other inputs, as we increment the nonce, most likely there's not even a valid d=1 hash as a result, let alone a d=1.5 million hash.  Or, you could get really lucky and there might be multiple d=1.5 million hashes that are valid in a single 2^32 nonce space.  Since the hash function is one-way there's no possible way to know what you're gonna get until you try.

Incidentally, if Bitcoins are really worth an amount equal to how much they cost to mine (as opposed to, you know, how much people are actually willing to pay for them), then why is the exchange rate falling today when difficulty is still going up?  Maybe it's because difficulty follows price after all, and not the other way around?

A lower difficulty level means that an individual miner whose hashing rate remains constant will get a bigger slice of the pie.  That simply means that, out of the average of 300 BTC awarded per hour, he will get more.  But he's only getting more because there are *fewer total people mining*!  So the average per miner times the number of miners continues to equal 300 BTC per hour.
The market isn't set by any one individual participant; it's set by all of them collectively.  So you can't look at it from the perspective of an individual miner without also controlling for the *number* of miners.  Basically, you're switching frames of reference and coming to an erroneous conclusion.

It's one thing to say that something is true.  For any X we can say that X is true.  It's another thing to provide evidence for it.


Boom, we both agree that rising price increases profitability increases difficulty level down the line.  The reasoning behind it is so simple it can be stated in a single sentence.  There's the justification behind "interpreting the system" in such a way.  But where's the justification for your claim that rising difficulty level increases price down the line?  I still haven't seen you propose a valid mechanism by which this happens.


I'm not arguing anything of the sort?  You're tackling a straw man here.  Bids and asks set the *price*.  They don't have anything to do with the difficulty level (and the difficulty level appears to be our main locus of dispute).
I still haven't seen an acknowledgment by you that the difficulty factor exists only to cancel out the number of miners such that the supply grows at a constant, predictable rate.  You're focusing so much on the difficulty level when the very point of it is to make fluctuations in miners irrelevant.  Why do you think the difficulty level affects how likely people are to sell their Bitcoins on the market?  We know that the *price* has an effect, but the difficulty level?
A higher difficulty level just means that the pie has more slices into it, so there are more people, each with a smaller number of bitcoins.  Are you contending that in such a situation people are less likely to sell smaller amounts at a time or something?  That's one potentially credible explanation as to how difficulty might affect price (by way of affecting supply).  I think it might be an almost negligible influence, but it's still credible.
What I'm looking for from you is some kind of explanation as to how difficulty level affects price.  It doesn't affect total supply, obviously.  It potentially affects the distribution of supply (although difficulty level, being a single number, doesn't tell is if, say, a rise is caused by more people joining in with small rigs, or if it's caused by existing miners all simply upgrading their rigs somewhat).  Maybe what you're looking for is some kind of Gini coefficient analog for mining capacity.  But I have still not seen an explanation as to how difficulty level drives price.

I have no idea what this is or what the point of it is, however, I do have two related things to discuss:
a) [Witcoin](  It's like Reddit, except that it costs some fraction of a Bitcent to submit and upvote articles.  The upside is, if you get a lot of upvotes on a submission, I think you can earn more than your money back.  So think of it as Reddit with a micropayment system that rewards high-quality link submissions.
b) Reputation is an important mechanism by which to establish trust during an online Bitcoin exchange.  For instance, yesterday, I sold a copy of Portal 2 to a random guy I met online through a chat room for 1.57 BTC.  I was able to secure his trust by using my online reputation both through the [Bitcoin-OTC]( system, but also through my account at Wikipedia.  So he sent the money first, and then I sent him the copy of the game.  By essentially staking my reputation on behaving honorably in the trade, he knew I was going to deliver.
Similarly, we could have a system like Bitcoin-OTC that uses a person's Reddit karma as backing.  Old Reddit accounts with lots of link and comment karma establish a reputation of sorts that one is not going to trivially throw away to rip off one person in a trade.  It could be something as simple as a new Subreddit where people write posts under their account committing to a trade with so-and-so, and then once parties have posted, they do the trade.  If either party welches out, then the aggrieved party can simply point to the agreement posted to Reddit as proof that the other behaved dishonorably.  There's the minor issue of solving the deletion-of-posts problem, but there are solutions to that.
If something like this is what the OP suggested, then I am all for it.

Well at that point I'd just keep the wallet, encrypted, on the USB stick as well.

It's simpler than that.  All you have to do is step through the blockchain (which you already have) and add up the difficulty level of each block.  Obviously all of those initial blocks at d=1 are going to be completely negligible compared to the more recent blocks at d=1 million and up.
Anyway, once you've added up all the difficulty numbers, you know how many d=1 shares there were in the history of Bitcoin.  So just multiply that by the [number of hashes required to calculate a d=1 share]( and you have a pretty much perfect idea of how much computational power has ever gone into Bitcoin (not including invalid blocks of course).

It also depends on the relative profitability of mining versus buying coins.  Right now, given the current difficulty level (and a moderate exponential increase into the future), several hundred dollars spent on a rig might return, in its lifetime, something like 20 BTC.  Now if the exchange rate was only at a few bucks per BTC, buying BTC outright would be a vastly wiser choice than buying the rig.  So I'm asking, what's your inflection point?  At which exchange rate would you no longer recommend building a rig?  Because $14/BTC is already below that point for me.  And say the value crashed a lot further, to $3/BTC, I definitely can't imagine you would spend any more on hardware.

What?  SHA256 is used extensively in the Bitcoin protocol (for instance, your client has to do a SHA256 verification every time it forwards any transaction).  We're still talking milliseconds to run it.  Why use anything else?  You'd just draw suspicions.  Saying SHA256 is "overkill" is like saying that adding a few extra drops of fuel to an airliner is "overkill".

Yup, that is 100% not the case.  I would recommend spending some time playing around on [Block Explorer]( to get a better idea of how this stuff works.  With Block Explorer you can actually look at the raw JSON data that makes up the blocks, transactions, etc.  Here's an arbitrary recent [raw transaction](  Notice that the only information it contains is the hashes identifying the prior transaction outputs that are being spent, destination addresses, amounts, and script signatures proving that the person who wrote this transaction had access to the private keys associated with the addresses whose transaction outputs are being redeemed.  There are no IP addresses or anything else.  Heck, there isn't even a timestamp.  The only identifying information is the Bitcoin address hashes, which cannot be tied back to a person easily at all.

And you haven't given a single explanation as to how difficulty would create upwards price pressure, especially since it exists only as a decoupling mechanism to keep the rate of increase of supply *constant*.


You're arguing against a strawman again.  I'm not arguing bids/asks.  I'm arguing over the specific mechanism of difficulty.  You've now resorted to deflecting an answer to a vague "somewhere else in this thread" (without even linking a specific post!).  If you're so sure of this, why can't you just tell me?  How does rising difficulty increase price?  Out with it!
@_date: 2011-07-03 16:15:19


No, that is bunk.  You're using a [labor theory of value]( which is completely discredited.  As an analogy, I could smash granite down into sand using only handpicks and hammers, and charging $100 per pound of sand might be "reasonable" based on how much effort I put into it, but that doesn't mean the sand is actually worth that much.
Similarly, Bitcoins are worth whatever people are willing to pay for them.  It doesn't matter how hard they are to generate.  If mining is no longer profitable for some people then they will simply stop mining; they have no mechanism by which to demand a price that will ensure their profitability (otherwise it implies there could be an infinite number of miners in the system).

The best way I can think of is to trade BTC for cash in a coffee shop or some other public area with WiFi.  Both Bitcoins and cash are irreversible transactions (which can't be said for PayPal, which leaves you open to fraud).  The buyer hands the cash to the seller, the seller does the transaction on his computer, and then they wait until the buyer sees the transaction as confirmed on his own computer.
As to how to meet up with someone willing to exchange BTC for cash in person, try local Craigslist or something?

As other people have pointed out, a lot of the hardware that people are using for mining (such as Radeon 5830s) really won't have any resale value if Bitcoin collapses.  Gamers have already moved on from these older cards, and the used market right now is entirely supported by Bitcoin miners.  So if you think Bitcoin is collapsing, you should sell your hardware now while there are still other miners out there who'll buy it from you used.
I'm not doing that mind you; I don't think Bitcoin has a bad future.  But, logically, if you do, you should sell out your older hardware while it still commands decent prices.
Now people mining on 68-- and 69-- series GPUs, however, have a lot less to worry about.
@_date: 2011-08-01 02:59:18
And the reason it can't work like that is because it would allow duplication of coins.  Nope, the coins "exist" not in the wallet but in the consensus blockchain, and many parts of the Bitcoin protocol are designed around ensuring that there is only one consensus blockchain.

Additionally, you said "less mining = better price", which is simply wrong.  What you meant to say, I believe, was "less mining = more BTC per miner that sticks it out".  That one at least is true in the same trivial sense that "less incentive = less mining" is true.

Yup, hence the need for escrow.


Yes, that way anyone can verify the "die roll".  That's how I would implement it as well.  Otherwise you have no way of knowing that a random roll was actually performed.
Regarding your modulus idea, yes, that would work.  It's exactly the same as throwing a bunch of tickets into a hat and picking one at random.  Doing it on 256-bit numbers is just an implementation detail; computers are well up to that task.  All you're really asking for is arbitrary precision integer division (the modulus is just the remainder of that operation), which every scientific math library should be able to do.  I can think of at least three such libraries just for C/C++ alone that are up to the task.  Also, Mathematica, Matlab, bc, etc., make these operations available to the end user, though in the context of writing a program to run a lottery, we're more interested in libraries.

I would take the gold, sell it, and diversify that $20 million into a variety of holdings, including primarily stocks but also some savings vehicles.
Bitcoin is just way too risky.  $20 million would be nearly all of my net worth, and it wouldn't make sense to keep nearly all of my net worth in such a risky vehicle.  If I was already worth a hundred million, then keeping another 20 million or so in Bitcoins might be an acceptable level of risk.

There are no good centralized alternatives to MyBitcoin.  You should be running the client locally, period, end of discussion.  Anything centralized is a loser right out of the gate given how Bitcoin works.  All it takes is one hack of a centralized site, or one malfeasant operator, and *everything* is gone.
Honestly this question is kind of hard for me to fathom.  It's like asking "I went up to one bouncer, called him a faggot, and he knocked me out cold.  What derogatory statement should I call the next bouncer I run into?"  The answer is you should simply *stop doing that*, not try to do it in a slightly different way.
@_date: 2011-08-01 01:18:23
What exactly are you worried about?  Remember that transactions are routed through the Bitcoin network in a P2P manner.  If you receive a transaction from another node there's no way of knowing if that other node originated the transaction or if it is merely passing it along (this is also exactly how Tor's anonymizing works).  So there's no way of associating a receiving address with a given IP address.
Anyway, tell me your specific concern if that's not it, but I think you're worrying about something that you need not be.  The only other information that's leaking is that a given IP address is running *a* Bitcoin node, but that's it.

Fortunately, there are efficient counting algorithms for looping over a sparse list.  Rather than counting up by one each time (which is, of course, absurd in a 2^256 space), you make a list of all the differences between each element in your list, and then you count up by the differences.  This counting algorithm's efficiency is only proportional to the number of items in the list and is not affected at all by how large the number domain is.
So SHA256, 32 bits of a RIPEMD hash, whatever, they'd all run about as fast.  Though I'd prefer the latter for no other reason than that your loop counter could be an unsigned int instead of whatever arbitrary precision data type you'd need to use to store a 256-bit counter (you'd probably just dip into a math library).

Secondly, to put their words into normal banking terminology, what they're doing is charging you a back-end withdrawal fee on getting your money *out* of Flexcoin.  Why the hell would I ever want to do that?  Why trade my Bitcoins, which are freely exchangeable, into "Flexcoins", which cost a fee to get back out of their system?  Because they'll give me some nominal amount per month until the whole Ponzi scheme collapses?
Also, you do realize that it's impossible to derive monthly profits from one-time fees, right?  (The fees that occur on withdrawals.)  The ability to make the monthly payouts depends solely on the ability to get more suckers depositing their money into the system.  Eventually the whole Ponzi scheme is just going to collapse.  There is absolutely no valid business plan here.

The issue, though, is that a lot of password cracking (at least for RSA-style systems) can consist of nothing more than "factor this number".  And it's easy to transform the problem into something else that really doesn't look like password cracking at all, but that has a constant time transformation back to the solution for the original password.
Other than that, if you can sell GPU processing power for more than the mining output right now, which given how low the exchange rates are, really doesn't seem that hard, then you would have a winner on your hands.

What exactly does "better price" mean then, and how does less difficulty cause "better price"?  You're being as clear as mud.  You already walked that back and defined "better price" as potentially meaning "lower difficulty", so then what you initially said was "lower difficulty = lower difficulty", which is a tautology, and then there's no link from there to "more incentive" whatsoever.
@_date: 2011-07-05 20:21:35
Haha, wow, you just backed down *a lot*.  And you seemed so sure of yourself before ...
The basic mechanism setting Bitcoin price is demand.  Bitcoins are worth what people are willing to pay for them.  If the ratio of price to present difficulty level is high, then mining is very profitable, miners will bring a lot of new rigs online, and the difficulty level will rapidly increase until the ratio of price to present difficulty level falls back to some sort of parity.  It's really that simple.  You're making things out to be waaay more complicated than they are.
There is no feedback cycle whereby a low ratio of price to present difficulty will cause price to go higher.  It will simply cause future difficulty level to decrease, because it sure as heck isn't profitable to build new rigs, and people facing higher electricity costs will just turn off their rigs.  With today's drops in the exchange rate we're well within the window where new rigs are no longer profitable, and if the exchange rate continues dropping, you're actually going to see people selling their rigs (and the difficulty level potentially decreasing).
@_date: 2011-08-05 00:06:11
What you described doesn't do that though?  You need a lot more than just the wallet.dat to spend your money.  You need a running client, with a network connection, and the entire blockchain.  Basically you're going to need to bring a laptop or a mobile phone with a Bitcoin client installed.  You can keep the wallet encrypted on that device until you go to spend with it, anyway.
Meanwhile, my solution is to just use bitcoind on my home computer which is accessible from the web via SSH.  I can log in from anywhere and spend my Bitcoins if I so choose (and indeed, have done so many times in the past).  Though I will grant that running what essentially amounts to a home server is definitely less convenient than just logging into a website.  But the website solution has huge issues, as we saw.
Eventually, if/when Bitcoin gets big enough, there will be a real comany that is trustworthy enough to handle a wallet service.  I'm imagining something like, unfortunately, PayPal.  But I'd rather have Bitcoin much more popular and get much more use even if there is a large company or two doing wallet services than just the way it is now.

Look in your .bitcoin directory and you should see some large files in there, such as blk0001.dat, that actually contain the contents of the blocks.

This is a worthless example because the difficulty level is not decoupleable from the rate of bitcoin generation.  Indeed, difficulty level is *nothing more* than a scaling factor, calculated using a sliding window of 2016 blocks, that ensures that a new block is mined (on average) six times an hour.  Since your hypothetical is worthless, so too is the rest of your argument that is based on it.
Let me give you the exact same argument as applied to gold:  If gold were so easy to mine that anyone could take a shovel out into their backyard and, after fifteen minutes of digging a hole, come up with a pound of gold nuggets, would you pay $1,500 per ounce?  Of course not!  Well, guess what, gold ain't that easy to mine, and likewise, the difficulty level ensures that Bitcoin ain't that easy to mine either.  Hypothesizing a difficulty level of 100 in an era when a *single* GPU can find an average of over 100 d=1 shares in an hour is *every* bit as unrealistic (and thus irrelevant) as my hypothetical ease of mining gold.

I can't think of an alternative currency blockchain that could possibly add anything worthy of value that wouldn't be swamped by the huge network effects that already sustain Bitcoin.

None of those make nearly as much difference as having a large number of people actually using said currency, which Bitcoin has and all of the others have not.

Some of the ones already demonstrated in Wright's scripts include using &amp; instead of &amp;&amp; to change the expected flow of execution, or using a slightly typoed variable name to end up with either a blank or something you slyly pre-set in the environment variables -- this can easily result in an entirely different file than the one you expected being "verified".

It depends on lots of factors: If transaction congestion increases or decreases, whether anyone keeps retransmitting it beyond three days, etc.  You could look at historical information on all transactions to hit the mempool and try to make some predictions on it.
Important clarification though: Unless and until the transaction has actually been confirmed in a block on the main chain, then the coins have not left your wallet.  Your wallet software will show them as unavailable, which can be a useful feature, but if you imported your keys into wallet software, or just wiped out the saved transactions in this one (which I've done before), then the coins will immediately show as available to be spent again.

Hell, I'm just using a $15 USB stick on my dedicated mining rig.  The only things you should be spending any money on for Bitcoin mining are (a) the GPUs (b) a big enough power supply to run the GPUs and (c) a motherboard with enough slots to attach a large number of GPUs at once.  Everything else, like processors, RAM, cases, hard drive space, etc., needs to be skimped on to the maximum extent possible.

I have an older desktop computer on a good connection and blockchain verification is completely CPU-bound.  It wouldn't surprise me at all for the same to be true even more so on a Pi.
The average block has over a thousand transactions in it now.  That takes a lot to verify, especially because the total set of unspent transactions is larger than what can fit into memory on a Pi, so you've got all sorts of disk access going on potentially for each transaction.
@_date: 2016-05-06 17:08:57
The situation in that regard has turned into a farce, as here you have people who claim to be in favor of scaling who are saying that they will never run a segwit-capable client, even though it allows for a good scaling factor *without* requiring a hard fork, for no other reason than it isn't their preferred solution, even though it's not even mutually exclusive with their preferred solution.  In the future I predict we will have both segwit and larger block sizes.

Those are the pre-SI abbreviations though.  "MM" meaning a thousand thousand (in Roman numerals) is less common nowadays than simply "M" for Mega, meaning million.  Parallel to "MM" there's also "M", which is supposed to mean thousand (again, Roman numerals), but no one uses that anymore because Mega is used way more widely and it'd be too confusing.  Since the old "M" has gone out of fashion, so too should the old "MM".

I think that Gavin was duped by an excellent conman, and that he's going to feel really dumb about it when Wright is never able to prove who he says he is except under carefully controlled conditions.  You know how the real Nakamoto proved that messages were coming from him?  He signed them.  With his [PGP key](  Just as I did in [this comment](  It takes less than a minute to do, and it would vanquish almost all uncertainty.  Nakamoto already has a proven track record of using cryptography to verify the authenticity of his communications (as you would expect from *the founder of Bitcoin*, which is built on the same technologies).  Its absence here is glaring.
My offer still stands to anyone else reading this.  I will bet up to 10 BTC, at even odds, on the following proposition:
"By the end of May 2016 UTC, Craig Wright will not have proved his identity in a widely verifiable way, defined as releasing a signed message saying that Craig Wright is Nakamoto that is signed with either the known Nakamoto PGP key or the privkey from the genesis block."

You claimed that it was an "accounting trick", and not "an actual optimization".
Given that it actually does allow more transactions per block, and equivalently also more transactions per second, that is plainly wrong.  Additionally, it accomplishes so using only a soft fork, not a hard fork (which increasing the block size would), which is also superior.  It is win/win.

As some context for people who may not understand what this means: Minecraft is an incredibly popular game that has a multiplayer component.  Multiplayer servers are not run by the owners of Minecraft, they're run by random people.  A lot of said servers use a free to play (pay for perks), donation, or subscription model in order to recoup the costs of running a server; some of them are quite profitable.  A decent server will have several dozen simultaneous players.
So the use of Bitcoin to pay server operators for subscriptions, donations, or in-game bonuses totally makes sense.  It also makes sense to establish an in-game economy where players can trade valuable stuff with each other, similar to lots of other virtual economies like World or Warcraft or Second Life, which have in-game virtual currencies that can also be bought/sold in the real world.

This logic doesn't follow to me at all.  People do stupid things all the time.  Just because someone does something stupid does not mean that they are correct.
No real proof whatsoever has been furnished by Craig Wright.  Instead, we've gotten proof that looks clearly fraudulent (the replay of the existing signature transaction), and he is already a known fraudster associated with previous attempted impersonation of Satoshi Nakamoto.

Gavin isn't one of the most important developers, not any more.  He's only committed [a single change]( since September 2015, which could have easily been handled as a pull request.
There's an important concept in computer security called limited permissions.  People should only have the permissions that they need, and if they are not using them, they should be removed.  This is enforced very strictly at my employer, for instance.  Gavin simply has not been committing nor merging much code at all in recent times, so it's reasonable to remove that permission.  A similar audit should be made of all other existing people with commit access, and revoke it from those who aren't using it as well.
If someone wants to become active again, that commit access can always be restored.  Has Gavin even asked for it back?  And if so, is he actually planning on getting active in development again?

Satoshi only ever communicated with people via electronic means.  What exact mechanism are you proposing that could provide validation of identity if not cryptography?  You're right, emails can be hacked, and Satoshi's *was*.  Pure cryptographic verification is the only shot we have at verifying Satoshi's identity, because it's the only kind of evidence we have reasonable belief can't be trivially forged.

I still use double spaces and I'm a bit under 36.  I started using computers way back in the monochrome, fixed-width font era, and learned from my mom, who was from the fixed-width electric typewriter era.  Even to this day a lot of my typing is in fixed-width environments like programming or coding.
Double spaces just work better in fixed-width fonts.  It's ingrained in me, and even though it isn't necessary in variable-width fonts it's more hassle to switch back and forth between the two modes, so I always do double.

None of that is good evidence.  Any good forger with an awareness of psychology could pretend to be him with decent accuracy by mimicking his writing style (and confirming such by running analysis programs against the respective corpuses until they returned high matches).  Worse, given that his webmail account *was hacked*, there may not be any private information left that only Satoshi and his correspondents would know about.  And all of this would require us to place blind faith in people like Gavin, who has already shown that he does not deserve such faith because he fell for this ruse.

I don't think it's a conflict of interest though?  Segwit is a clear win for everyone as far as I'm concerned.  This is a Free Software project; no one can be forced to develop a specific feature; it's all in what people want to contribute.  It seems reasonable that companies would work on code that benefits them, so given a choice between feature A and feature B, both of which are complicated and require lots of development effort, it's reasonable that feature B might happen over feature A if feature B's development is being funded by a company.
The right solution to that, of course, is that if you really like feature A, you should be willing to pay for it or donate development effort yourself.
It should be pointed out that if Feature A is larger blocks, then it's far from trivial as far as scaling goes, because there are real attack problems that scale validation effort more than linearly with the block size, and require significant coding efforts to overcome.  It's not nearly as easy as just increasing the value of a constant.

I don't think we're on the same page here, because none of what you mentioned is relevant to fixed-width fonts.  [Here's what I'm talking about](  Note how the inline code comments use two spaces after punctuation, because the sentences would blend together too much otherwise.  Word processing programs almost as a rule do not use fixed-width fonts.  [Here's another example]( using fixed-width font that has a GUI on top (Eclipse).
My point is that so many hours of my day are spent doing that kind of stuff, where double-spacing is important, that double spacing is ingrained in my nature, and it's more effort to try to switch between modes when typing in a variable-width font, such as here on Reddit, than just typing the same way all the time.
If you inspect the HTML source of my comments here on Reddit versus yours, you'll see that mine display better in the fixed-width font used to display the HTML, because mine actually do have those double spaces and yours do not :P

More frequent blocks are more likely to be orphaned, so they are not identical. You get more bandwidth wastage in transmitting blocks that are orphaned.

No, hash rate is just the overall number of hash calculations performed per unit time, which is inferred from looking at how many blocks have been found over a given time window.  Note that since the average block finding time is expected to be ten minutes, in order to reduce the variance caused by randomness, your hash rate measurement window needs to be fairly large, like at least a day.


Nope.  Hash rate follows price, not the other way around.  If the hash rate is "low" for a given price then more money will be invested in miners, because it is more profitable, and the hash rate will rise.  If the hash rate is "high" for a given price then investment will lag and some miners who have expensive electricity may turn off entirely, and the hash rate will remain stagnant.
The price is Bitcoin is driven almost purely by market effects of supply and demand.  Mining is its own little independent ecosystem that doesn't affect prices, because the rate of Bitcoin creation is essentially constant regardless of hash rate thanks to the self-adjusting difficulty level.
@_date: 2016-07-26 18:43:54
It would get destroyed by attackers. The limit is a very real safety mechanism. All it would take is one attacker mining a single bad block somewhere to cause horrible problems for the entire network.
In practice you would have a lot of pools implementing their own max block and transaction sizes as a defense measure, and then you'd get chain hard forks every time a massive block was found.
Can you point me to even one successful altcoin that does away with the limit? Raising the limit is something reasonable people can disagree on. Removing it entirely is completely unworkable.
@_date: 2016-07-26 17:44:50
So now you've opened up the possibility of quadratic attacks whereby big transactions can take 64 times longer to verify.  It's not as easy as you're making it out to be.  Any real software engineer knows that it almost never takes just a single line of code to change something important.  There are real edge cases and attack vectors to worry about.
Oh, and you've also insta-forked the network as users gradually update new clients.  This kills the Bitcoin.  At the very least you would need signaling and a scheduled rollout of the hard fork, which is substantially more than one line of code.  Long story short, you don't really know what you're talking about.

It really doesn't tell you that much.  Just because a transaction hit the blockchain doesn't mean that ownership of the coins has changed.  It could be a person moving them around just for fun (I used to make interesting-looking transactions for fun), or they could be moving coins from an old wallet into a more secure cold storage kind of wallet setup.
I think the latter is more likely.  If I were sitting on a huge hoard of coins from back before the default Qt client even had encryption of private keys on disk, I would absolutely want to move my Bitcoins to a newly generated wallet that has never had private keys stored unsecured anywhere (or even on a box that has ever been connected to the Internet, for that matter).

Most of them would have a limit. So there would be a de facto limit, as any fork with a block in it larger than what 51% of the miners will accept would eventually die off. It's better to make that limit explicit.

Wow, Business Insider really can't afford editors ...
But seriously, we've seen the same kind of response after every Bitcoin crash, and I've personally seen several now.  Bitcoin always manages to recover, and ends up higher each time.  Past performance is no guarantee of future results, of course, but I wouldn't bet against it just now.  Is Bitcoin volatile?  Absolutely.  Are the claims of its demise inevitable any time its value takes a dip?  Apparently.  And to respond to one last point ...


He's defining a medium of exchange as being useful only if there is a central issuing authority.  He's thus crafting his very definition in such a way as to explicitly exclude Bitcoin.  This is dishonest, and worse than that, it is historically inaccurate.  I'm no gold booster (I would hate a return to the gold standard), but it did serve as an adequate medium of exchange across hundreds of societies and thousands of years.  All you really need in order to have a medium of exchange is something that is scarce (e.g. gold, or Bitcoin) and fungible (e.g. rare/valuable works of art are scarce, but not fungible, hence not suitable as an exchange medium).  Bitcoin easily meets these criteria.  And just in case it wasn't clear, gold definitely doesn't have a central issuing authority.

The priority equation factors in the total size of the transaction.  Any transaction of that size is automatically going to be high priority.  Fees are typically calculated automatically, not specified manually.  It gets so much priority automatically from the size of that transaction that it doesn't need a larger fee than the minimum.
Here's how priority is calculated:

I played that game a lot when I was a slightly older age than he was, and that game requires a huge amount of leadership (not dissimilar to the real Armed Forces, except, you know, without all the running around outside).  Running the  clan is no small accomplishment.  I was in a mildly successful clan myself, though just as a grunt, and there was a large amount of coordination, leadership, and teamwork that went into it.

Ah, got it, so when I start up bitcoind, once I unlock my wallet.dat, for the remainder of the lifetime of the bitcoind process, some malicious program with root access could read the password out of memory?  But that only applies if I've run bitcoind and then sent a transaction since opening it (and thus providing the password), correct?  If I start up bitcoind but I haven't yet done anything requiring a password, my wallet should still be secure, right?

What makes you think you can't put memory on custom hardware?  Look at a CPU chip design some time; on modern ones, *most* of the area on the die itself is memory.
Yes, you can mess with scrypt parameters, and require more memory, but that just means your custom hardware needs to be printed with more memory on it.  It's a difference in degree, not in kind.
And also, the big problem with trying to make a solution immune to custom hardware (when fundamentally there's no real difference between a general purpose processor and a custom purpose processor; you can design a custom purpose processor to do anything) is that you end up being very susceptible to botnet attacks.  Bitcoin is immune to botnet attacks because random commodity computers simply don't have any resources on them that are worth anything compared to how much hashing is going on on the Bitcoin network.  But with Litecoin, if you had a very successful botnet that could take deliver 2 million hacked PCs, that could initiate a &gt;50% network attack.

Scrypt is actually bad in the long run. It's not immune to custom hardware, it just takes a lot more development effort, making it more likely that a single group will corner the market. SHA256 is easy enough to do hardware for that there are many entrants in the field, thus reducing the monopoly risk by a lot. 
@_date: 2013-01-22 15:46:55
The TI-84 has around ~500 KB of available memory (which is actually horribly pathetic for a modern computing device that retails for over $100, but we won't examine vendor lock-in and the effects of market monopoly in this thread).  That's more than enough to implement the algorithms [mentioned here](  For god's sake, you're only dealing with 256 bits -- that's 32 bytes.  Yes you'll need many times that in available memory to run all the steps of the ECDSA, SHA-256, and RIPEMD-160 algorithms, but 32 bytes is so far below the available ceiling of 512,000 bytes that it's not even close, even if you use really memory-inefficient algorithms.
What makes you think there isn't enough memory?
EDIT: On second examination, by your comment about the buttons wearing out, it sounds like you think someone would be implementing the algorithm manually?  You know that these calculators are programmable, right?

It's a difference in kind, not degree, with the orphans. The current system only has orphans when blocks are found nearly simultaneously, and it is usually resolved within seconds. The suggested system with different nodes and miners having arbitrary and different limits would be much much worse as far as orphans goes.
Let's say roughly half the miners are enforcing a 2 MB limit and the other half are enforcing a 4 MB limit. How is this reconciled? How does it just not simply fork indefinitely?

You're not using the right definition of "win".  The people who have paid for lures, EXP boosts, and extra incubators have gained more levels than you have for the same amount of time spent playing the game, and their Pokemon are thus correspondingly stronger.  In a battle of who keeps control of gyms, they would thus win over you, because their Pokemon are stronger and hit harder.
@_date: 2013-01-22 15:43:40
Absolutely it's possible.  The TI-84 provides a Turing-complete programming environment, and more than sufficient memory to run the required ECDSA, SHA-256, and RIPEMD-160 algorithms.  Of course, these algorithms aren't provided for you by the existing libraries, so you'd have to write them from scratch, which would be a piece-and-a-half of work, especially seeing as how I don't believe the TI-84 offers native support for the data structures that would make it easy (byte arrays, bigints).  You could probably hack it up using string manipulations, which would probably run painfully slowly but still work, or just write it in TI assembly, which is how all the really cool applications are written anyway.

You're still not talking about the same thing.  Using correct tactics, battles are biased in favor of the attacker.  Forget tactics -- it's 6-on-1!  The point is, on the average case, he is more effective at attacking your guys than vice-versa because his Pokemon are stronger, and over an extended period of time battling over control over a gym, he will own it for a lot more time than you will because he will much more easily be able to take it from you than you from him.  Assuming that true PVP battles are added at some point in the future, this point will become even more stark.

It's a network defense against denial-of-service attacks that send lots of small tiny transactions to spam peers and clog up the blockchain.
You can see why the equation is set up the way it is.
The higher the value of the transaction, the higher the priority; this makes sense because typical spam transactions would send around a few satoshis, and it'd be very expensive (in terms of BTC holdings) to create spam transactions that had priority based solely on their value.
The input age also helps fight spam because with spam, your transactions would tend to have recent inputs, especially if you're continuously shuttling the same BTC back and forth between addresses.  It's a large limitation on spam that the transaction inputs need to be "old" in order to automatically get high priority.
And finally, there's an inverse relationship between priority and transaction size.  This makes sense because we want to incentivize transactions being as small as possible, because unnecessarily large transactions take up more network bandwidth and also more space in the block.  A classic spam transaction is huge because it has lots of meaningless inputs and/or outputs, or just lots of meaningless Bitcoin script in it.  Giving lower priority to larger transactions punishes these attempts.

Also, it should be pointed out that we aren't just interested in doing work for work's sake.  The work needs to have a purpose.  When you're finding actual blocks, the purpose is securing the blockchain.  Finding a block is very much a binary proposition; if you find a block, you extend the blockchain, add confirmations to a bunch of previously existing transactions, and add a bunch of new transactions to the blockchain for the first time.  All of this has value.  But if you just "miss" a block (i.e. you don't quite meet the target), it's worthless.
So you need some distributed way to verify and validate work performed, and said work needs to be meaningful.  Good luck.

Wow, that's really interesting.  It seems like this strategy is indeed faster on CPUs, though it doesn't offer speed improvements over GPUs (let alone ASICs), at least at current difficulty levels.
