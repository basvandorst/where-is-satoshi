I made the post because centralized exchanges are subject to risks that decentralized exchanges are not. All I know about the shapeshift-hack is from public sources. I read that about 300,000$ worth of anything was stolen by a former team member. The list is arbitrary and from the top of my head.
Not holding (and losing) customer (or any) funds is the way to go and I wish you all the best. Sorry you had such a prick on your team. (if the reports are true)

You suggested that Bitsquare stands to gain by taking a fee, which is not true.

That's a lie buddy.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:06:03
You mean cash deposit, right? 
We would love to offer this but we cannot think of a safe way for a buyer to proof he made a deposit. A simple picture of the receipt can be easily photoshopped. 
Sellers on localbitscoins demand full verification and pics of IDs next to faces. That's not Bitsquare-style.

Do you have an agenda?

True, it's such a great piece of software.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:04:28


Exactly. And it's far from being secure. This introduces tons of risks. Bitsquare is meant to be the safest exchange of the bunch.
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:22:35
You most probably did AML/KYC at your bank, too. That's the fiat part. The only way I see to get around KYC/AML is face to face trades. If you decide to go for f2f, you could still be meeting up with an agent or any other crook. 
Yet, no one knows what you use the okpay money for.
Additionally you gain privacy regarding your trading peer as you only share the okpay ID.
@_date: 2016-08-21 13:59:18
Please, at which point in the app are you asked to open an okpay account? 
We have no relationship at all with okpay. It's just one of very few payment processors that can not be charged back.
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:27:26
It's a matter of blockchain confirmations and/or fiat transfer speed.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:51:04


Yes, BTC is the base currency and 1 side of every trade. On the other side there are more than 50 cryptocurrencies that can be traded. Look at the list here: 
 


BTC-ETH 
You have ETH and want BTC
Choose ETH from the dropdown menu
There's an offer to sell BTC in the offerbook. You take the offer.
BTC from the offerer + his security deposit + your security deposit go to a 2-3 multi-sig address
You receive the 'contract' that shows the offerer's ETH wallet address. 
You now have 24h to deposit ETH to this address (directly from your ETH wallet to the offerer's ETH wallet.)
When the offerer sees enough confirmations, he confirms the payment in the Bitsquare client and the BTC are immediately payed-out.
That's it. This might sound like a lot of hassle, but it's really not. When you're a little used to trading, it's a matter of seconds to setup an offer or to take it. Trade time is then just limited by confirmation times


@_date: 2016-08-11 18:06:39
The arbitration system is not even fully implemented, yet. Nothing's fixed and could change possibly. It's too early to judge.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:05:21
The intention of the OP is to draw attention to Bitsquare and to let people know that there's an alternative to centralized exchanges. Volume on Bitsquare is still incredibly low, so I'm trying to point out advantages.
That Shapeshift is on the list is a coincidence and for sure the best of the bunch. What I especially like is the simplicity/usability. I personally don't use it much because I'm really bad at trading have no use for altcoins. 
You shouldn't be on the list especially considering how you dealt with the unfortunate happenings. Sorry.  
I still consider decentralized exchanges superior to traditional ones.

You can choose between a number of payment options: 
Fiat payments are done directly between trading peers. Bitsquare never touches it.
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:45:06
You open a fiat account in your Bitsquare client. 
This information is stored encrypted on your local machine. 
If you take an offer to sell BTC, the other trading peer receives your bank account info, to enable him to make the payment. All encrypted and over Tor. The buyer makes the fiat payment and confirms he did so. 
You confirm when you receive the fiat payment and the payout txs happen. Easy as pie.

Right now, the Bitsquare founder is the only arbitrator. He has no incentive to destroy the project for 1 or 2 BTC. The implementation of the decentralized arbitration system is on the roadmap to v1.0
Basically the arbitrators have more to lose than to gain and are selected more or less randomly. There's more which I don't remember atm.
I'd like to point you to the [Bitsquare FAQ](
**How is collusion between arbitrators and traders prevented?**
As outlined above, arbitrators must pay a high security deposit to become such – higher than the one-bitcoin trade limit. If an arbitrator’s dispute resolution is not agreed to by both traders, a second round of arbitration can be requested by either of them.
The Bitsquare system in this case will then select an arbitrator from among the highest-rated arbitrators. If collusion is found to have taken place, the misbehaving arbitrator will lose her deposit. This puts the arbitrator at a significant loss, as her security deposit was more than she made by being dishonest.

When accepting a trade, for example BTC - EUR (SEPA), you receive the banking info of your trading partner. You do a regular SEPA transfer. Once the peer confirms that he receivend the EUR, the bitcoins are released and can be transfered to your wallet.
**Interesting to know:** 
The software contains a local desktop wallet that only you control. You set it up with a password, make a backup and you're set.
BTC are transfered to a 2-3 multi-sig wallet. You have a key, trading peer has a key, and an arbitrator has control of the third key that is needed in case of a dispute. 
All personal info is encrypted and shown only to you and the trading peer. 
All traffic can be routed over TOR.
Edit: format

1 btc is equivalent to 600$. How many people do you think, have that kind of money lying around to exchange for btc. Additionally, you can take as many of 1 btc offers as you would like. The limit is per trade and not per individual.

Altcoin trading on Bitsquare has zero risk. In case of a dispute, you can prove that you did your part of the deal via blockchains.
Fiat is the difficult part.
@_date: 2016-08-04 16:36:06
You're certainly right. 
One final goal is to make Bitsquare doomsday-proof, there's just so much to consider. A first step is to find and implement as many (sufficiently hard to reverse) payment methods as possible.
TLSNotary is a huge accomplishment and I consider it a keypart of Bitsquare. Thanks (let's not forget for being awesome!

You might want to read the [Bitsquare white paper](
BTC-Fiat trades are secured by a combination of measures. This is completely new territory in the crypto world and we want to get it right. Especially since the limit is per trade and not per user. You can do hundreds of 'limited' trades at a time and thereby spread your risk.
The limit protects users since the start of Bitsquare and it is doing so very effectively, as there have been no scam attempts. I wouldn't call it 'a very crude tool'.
@_date: 2016-04-14 20:32:09
What they're doing is just natural, they're surviving. If shapeshift wouldn't eat the loss, no matter how much it is really, trust could never be reestablished. Shapeshift would be a dead rat. Centralized services are vulnerable and that will be taken advantage of.

You don't. You send the funds directly to your trading peer's account. Bitsquare doesn't hold any funds.

I'm not making that assumption. It was guessing.
I'm showing the possibility of more anonymous fiat transfers that could eventually find their way into bitsquare. It seems that is one of your interests. 
If you happen to know a suitable payment processor, that is very hard to charge back and that you could use, feel free to propose it.
@_date: 2016-04-23 17:58:39
From a quick look I'd say faster payments is suitable for trading at bitsquare. chargebacks seem to be a rare occurence and hard to do. I'll have to have a closer look though.

* Official Beta release will be at the end of april.
* More than 100 successful trades have already happened.
* Close to zero fees.
* You can trade BTC&lt;-&gt;FIAT using SEPA, Okpay, National Bank transfer, AliPay, Swish, Perfect Money
* You can also trade crypto&lt;-&gt;crypto:
ETH, DASH, NBT, LTC, NMC and many others.
* The order books are very thin at so moment, so please help filling them up.
@_date: 2016-08-09 09:38:49
The payment (BTC) goes to a 2-3 Multi-Sig address. Buyer, seller and arbitrator, each hold a key.
Let's say you're selling ETH. BTC deposits to Multi-Sig happen. You send ETH to the buyer. The buyer receives ETH but fails to confirm that he received the ETH payment. After the trade times out, (24h atm) you call the arbitrator. You prove the ETH payment. Arbitrator and you, both sign the BTC payout-tx to your wallet. Done!
No way for the other party to cheat.
It's the same if you're the buyer. If the seller fails to prove that he made the ETH payment to your ETH address, you'll receive your BTC payment back. Seller loses his security deposit.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:00:20
You will decide that for youself when it's implemented.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:11:28
Are you in the US? Cash deposit may be an option in the future.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:57:45
You know, people could have instant fiat transfers when using okpay. I'm not sure why people don't use them if they want to trade a lot. I have no relation with them, hell I even don't use them myself as I'm happy with SEPA, but...
@_date: 2016-08-04 14:09:53
Just exchange trading. Other instruments are part of considerations but won't happen this or even next year. There's just too much to do. Building decentralized systems can be a pain in the ass. If it was quick and easy there'd be tons but there's just Bitsquare.
Sorry for the rant ;-)
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:07:59

This is a pre-release candidate for the official Beta version.
Use with care for small amounts.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:04:12
In BTC&lt;-&gt;Fiat trades, that use bank transfers, both trading partners know the others banking details.
You could as well use a payment processor like Okpay. In that case Okpay knows your banking details as you have to tell them in order to withdraw fiat. I think you have to verify telling them all the other shit (id,... ), too. Your trading partners on bitsquare only know your okpay id.
I'm not sure if the following is possible:
You transfer btc to bitsquare. You could possibly use okpay to receive fiat (don't withdraw as you would have to tell them the id and stuff). Initially you don't have to tell them much personal information. You could then trade fiat&lt;-&gt;btc on bitsquare and withdraw btc from there. This way you could trade fiat without any aml/kyc stuff.
This is of course only useful if you're just about trading and not exchanging.
@_date: 2016-04-10 10:56:45
And paying for shit with coins from [Bitsquare](
The future is decentralized.
@_date: 2016-04-26 21:01:32
Tbh I don't know when trading limits will be raised.
At the moment they are in fact not a limitation but a security feature. Some of the offered fiat payment methods have been abused before. It's a combination of security measures that secure trading on bitsquare.
The limit is there to lower incentives. For example it's not worth risking a bank account for 1 btc since you can't just walk around and open hundreds of bank accounts.
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:49:10
Your bank account data is only shared with trading peers.
If you don't trade fiat you dont have to enter any data besides your respective cryptocoin addresses.
@_date: 2016-04-28 07:45:30
you could give bitsquare a shot:
volume is still on the low side but maybe ok for small time trying and testing
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:27:05
Beta release will be tomorrow during the Fab Lab in Barcelona.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:48:46
Confirmation is a click in the software.
If he doesn't confirm you can call the arbitrator. You'll be provided with instructions to cryptographically prove that you sent the funds. So will be the trading peer. Who fails to prove loses the case and the winner receives the funds (arbitrator key+your key)
The cheater loses the security deposit as well.
@_date: 2016-04-14 13:13:15
It's the other way around and they have been made aware of that. Synero didn't seem to care.
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:45:39

@_date: 2016-04-19 16:39:41
You know, you can always propose a payment method you wish to use. If it's sufficiently hard to charge back bitsquare might consider implementing it, as payment processor integration is on of the easier things.
Please tell me where you're located at (pm me if you want) and I'll look into it.

Incentives are discussed broadly, there are plenty. Huge hurdles like sending bills as proof of residency, waiting days for confirmation and tons of other stuff are real draw backs.
Getting pocket changes worth of bitcoin within seconds to try it out is game changing material. Or it might be buying instantly to profit of discounts which creates first timers. People need to feel the advantages to realize how awesome Bitcoin is. All the technical aspects of Bitcoin is too much to deal with if you read about it in your coffee break.

The point is that a former chief-economist of the biggest german bank, clearly propagates the downfall of the current money system, also known as passive money system, built on debt.
He proposes an active money system, just like bitcoin. What he does not know is the superiority of Bitcoin as a protocol and as of today the only realistic candidate for such a system.

As magic internet money, then I start getting serious. I talk about the fixed supply, that it's not counterfeitable(?) (which is what no one believes since you can copy everything with a computer), then one word leads to another.


'Really? That shit is expensive.' and 'That's not for me'


Right after the first Silk Road Crash. I first heard about it at least a year before but couldn't buy and forgot about it. Silk Road put it back on the map i, I think, October 2013.


Easy Multi-Sig. Nice look and feel. I'm afraid an average user doesn't want to read about backing up keys and stuff like that.


I want it to completely replace fiat. I want to pay everything and everywhere.


Looks promising.


Sure, this will be the biggest motivation for new users to switch.

Don't be, here's the tutorial for an Electrum offline wallet
From the Electrum site: 
**How to make offline transactions using your Master Public Key**
Get an offline computer. This can be a physical device or a separate installation on your current computer. I would advice a Debian installation with encrypted home folder for extra security.
**[Offline PC]** Install Electrum via a USB-Key.
**[Offline PC]** Create a new wallet. Write down the seed and memorize it, after which you should probably destroy the seed or keep it safe in a lockbox.
**[Offline PC]** Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export and copy your "Master Public Key" and put it in a text file on your USB-Key.
**[Online PC]** Install Electrum and select "Create a watching-only version of existing wallet", you will then be prompted to enter your "Master Public Key".
**[Online PC, existing Electrum installation]** See below how to make Electrum to restore or open alternative, non-default, wallet.
You now have an online wallet where you can check your balances and give out new addresses, but you can't however spend the coins. So if an attacker would be able take over your online computer your coins can't be lost.
**To make a transaction do the following:**
**[Online PC]** Go to the send tab and make a transaction. Instead of sending it, Electrum will detect a seedless wallet and query for a location to save the transaction. Select your USB-Key.
**[Offline PC]** Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; "Load raw transaction". Select your transaction from the USB-Key. It will detect it's not signed and will prompt you to do so now. Fill in your password and sign the transaction. Save the new, signed, transaction to your USB-Key.
**[Online PC]** Go to Settings -&gt; Import/Export -&gt; "Load raw transaction". Select the signed transaction and it will ask you if you want to broadcast it.
Hope this helps you to sort it out.

No, the users of Bitsquare build a P2P network with a distributed offerbook. In the regular trade process there's no involvement of its developers or anyone.
A possible way of monetization could be being an arbitrator. Arbitrators are real persons that can be called in case of a dispute. They will have to decide who has done right and who is trying to scam. Arbitrators collect the trading fees (a couple of USD cents) and the security deposit of the scammer. This is not final information and could be changed anytime, please keep that in mind.
Please read about the arbitration system in the [FAQ]( (in short) or the [pdf]( (in detail)
To explain the trade process:
All funds necessary for trades are stored in 2-of-3 MultiSig adresses. 2 keys release the funds (Seller, Buyer, Arbitrator, you need two of these). Remember, the arbitrator is a person, that will only be involved in a trade if someone calls him (In case of a dispute).

I say minimal fees on Bitsquare. Fiat transactions can be expensive and apply to the buyer.
 Here's the text from the FAQ:
There is a small trading fee which serves as protection against spam and market manipulation. The fee goes to the arbitrators for their service availability. For all transactions there are the normal bitcoin mining fees needed. All fees combined are in the range of USD cents. Banking fees might apply for making a national currency transaction.
If there is a dispute the arbitrator will charge a fee for their time solving the dispute. That is predetermined by every arbitrator and their fee will be paid from the security deposit of the party losing the dispute.
Bitsquare does not receive fees itself. Development is funded using an iterative crowdfunding approach.

Alright, a use case I can come up with: Your daughter leaves the country with a couple of friends for holidays or a study trip or could be anything. You don't want her to carry lots of money cause it can easily be lost or stolen in such a case. So you top up her wallet every day with what is needed.
To make it more exciting you can focus on the new/hip aspect when a friend looses all her money or stunned faces when she pays a check at a restaurant. Maybe followed by her sending a picture of said dinner to her dad and him happily topping up her wallet, again.

1 - You have a point here. However, you're not completely right. You will need a 'small amount' (still to be determined) as security deposit and not the amount you'd want to buy. There are a couple of possibilities to obtain a small amout, e. g. work, tips, friends or family. 
At the beginning Bitsquare will not be directed towards complete Bitcoin newbies. In the future we will think about becoming more newbie friendly.
2 - You're right here. 
Bitsquare for sure isn't suitable for daytraders and the likes. It's rather directed at people that want to sell some bits to cover bills they have to pay in fiat or anything and buyers that care about security, low fees, decentralization and transparency.

Here's the article:
'This month's decreasing bitcoin price has provoked many questions about the market's fundamentals. While it is clear that the price of any asset will be determined by the interplay between buying demand and selling pressure, it is important to understand who the current market participants are and why they make certain decisions.
The bitcoin market is unique in that it has participants who must sell bitcoin on an ongoing, daily basis. These participants place a consistent downward pressure on the price, which means the bitcoin price naturally has a downward tendency. These selling market participants include:
Bitcoin miners
Bitcoin payment processors
In order for the bitcoin price to increase, downward selling pressure must be outweighed by net buying demand in the market. Market participants that are net buyers include:
Bitcoin wallet providers (Circle, Coinbase, Xapo)
Bitcoin ATMs
Speculative investors and traders
Consumer-side payment processors (doesn't really exist yet)
Because it is easier from a regulatory and technology perspective to build merchant processing platforms versus consumer payments platforms, we have seen greater adoption of bitcoin by merchants versus consumers. Why exactly hasn't consumer adoption taken off? First, the consumer market for private currency is very niche and not very large. Second, bitcoin gives all cost savings and benefits to merchants and not consumers. Third, American Express and other credit card companies entice consumers through rewards programs, which are not yet available to people using bitcoin. At this stage, the bitcoin industry is 2-3 years out from matching credit card companies' value proposition to consumers, and we should expect weak price growth until that is resolved. On the remittance side, it is still difficult to place Bitcoin ATMs across the country in large quantities, which must also be resolved for consumer adoption to grow.
In summary, we find ourselves in a market where non-speculative bitcoin users are mostly sellers, predominately relying on speculative buyers to support upward price movement. At the moment, there is not enough buy-side demand to outweigh the non-speculative selling pressure.
The long term outlook for bitcoin is very positive, but there are a number of regulatory, technological and consumer value proposition challenges that still need to be resolved. To assess the fair value of bitcoin, users should analyze bitcoin's current usefulness for consumers versus other payment options that are available. When its value proposition becomes meaningful to a large consumer population, demand for bitcoin will grow–as will the bitcoin price.'

What do you mean by dumping the coin? Move to mine other cryptos? I think you're mixing two different things together:
Block rewards (25 BTC atm) will be paid roughly every ten minutes even if there's only one miner left. This will go on for many years to come as Block rewards are declining over time. (I think 60 or more years)
It is intended that transaction fees will support the miners after that to be enough of an incentive.

To be safe you need a cold storage solution. 
If you are tech savy I'd recommend [Armory]( cold storage.
Just as safe but less hassle is [Electrum]( which can be used for cold storage.
[Trezor]( is a hardware wallet and easy for people who feel not capable of the solutions above. It has a prize tag of 119$ shipped.
An upcoming solution for easy paper wallet creation is [Mycelium Entropy]( which comes in at 40$ shipped.
When creating paper wallets please consider 2 or more copies stored in different physical locations in case your house burns down or occuring water hazards for example.

I first heard about Bitcoin in 2011 I guess, but didn't care a lot. Next time was during the bubble April 2013. I got a quick grip, and wanted to put some money into it. My girlfriend at the time talked me out of it. 
Next time I stumbled upon Bitcoin was during the silkroad crash and I knew i wouldn't let that opportunity pass. I tested, bought in and I'm ever learning since. It's fascinating. 
I'm a regular dude with tech interest and hardly any skills. My judgement was made of simple evaluation of aforementionned benefits vs status quo of Bitcoin.
- To me transaction fees are bearable and I like what I hear and see about concepts for micro transactions (ChangeTip).
- I can imagine solutions for confirmation times since I think that double spends are a rather theoretical problem. Serious exploitation would need some action though.
- Existing structures provide a sufficiant degree of anonymity. I'm sure this will improve from time to time (Dark Wallet etc)
I hope this is readable as this is not my 1st language.

You're absolutely right. It's much more demanding obviously. 
But let's be honest here. When I got into Bitcoin (that was well before the MtGox-drama) there was security advice everywhere already. 
My very first concern was not to have my coins stolen. I instanlled ubuntu on an offline netbook and set up Armory for cold storage. I'm not a too technical guy and I needed very detailed instructions but it was definitely doable. 
What I want to say is that bitcoin security is key as it is with all finacial stuff you do on the net and to a certein extent it's up to you and your concern.

Because your question was about profit. There are talks about models to some form of monetization but nothing serious as of now.

0.00% seem totally fair. You never know what type of traders you face. I'd say most are there for making profit and some are there to share the love :-)


That's what I think, too. The EUR market is quite liquid (in Bitsquare terms) and if I make a reasonable offer (small deviation from market), offers are taken quickly.

It's peer-2-peer, that's as decentralized as it gets and a major improvement to centralized exchanges (-bitcoin.de for example who do fiat p2p but take your BTC hostage; Edit: and collect your all your fiat account data).
@_date: 2017-02-24 21:54:12


Ok, that's because Sweden is no EUR country. In the default SEPA settings Sweden is unselected. I think no one bothers to select non EUR countries.
You can leave your machine running. Max trade time for SEPA is 8 days. That's because Bitsquare has to take into account weekends, bank holidays and international SEPA transfers that take a couple of working days sometimes.
You can shut down your client with open offers as well. you won't lose them. They'll just not show up in the order book.
@_date: 2014-10-20 15:18:27
Official implies there's some kind of authority (e.g. state, corporate body) behind it. If anything related to Bitcoin should claim to be official, I'd say it's the developers.
Edit: Since it's decentralised, essentially no one should claim to be an official Bitcoin representative.

As I understand you accepted an offer to buy 1 BTC. So you will have to make the SEPA transfer to the seller's account.
Once the seller sees the money in his account he confirms the transfer.
If he does not confirm receiving the money the trade will go into arbitration after the max trade period (8 days for SEPA).
The arbitrator will ask you and the other trader for proof of the transfer. 
Typically this will be a cryptographically secure 'screenshot' of an online banking page. This is done using TLSnotary, a small program that allows this. 
Don't worry, though. I don't think it came to this even once.

Usability is one of our main concerns. Trading on Bitsquare will be secure and easy.
When a seller or trader is trying to cheat, there will be a more complex system to solve disputes. But the goal is to disincentivise cheaters in general.
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:06:42
Thanks for mentioning.
There are a number of measures planned for Bitsquare to prevent collusion of traders and arbitrators. If you feel collusion is happening, you can escalate your case to the arbitrator pool to review the case.
Arbitrators in Bitsquares system have the incentive to be honest because they could lose their (powerful) position.
Arbitrators will have to make a (large) security deposit they could lose over fraud.
Arbitrators are chosen "randomly" (with regard to language, availabitlity, trade size, reputation)
These are just ideas. Non of these are finalized. [Read more (pdf)](

:-) No problem, thanks for trusting us so much that you'd risk your money at that early stage.
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:44:58


There are offers for lending the initial amount at the [Bitsquare forum](


The payment methods you can use are tested and (at least) sufficiently hard to reverse. Bitsquare's security protocol takes into account that you can never trust banks and hence have other security mechanisms in place to provide for utmost safety.
I'd recommend starting with trading small amounts until you get more confidence in the protocol.

I think it depends of the amount of fiat you invest. I feel a couple of thousands wouldn't raise eyebrows.

Once an order is taken, the trade period starts.
When you setup an order you already acknowledged it can be taken.
What happens is the following:
* You create an order
* Someone takes it - trade period starts
* Waiting for blockchain confirmation
* Buyer starts fiat payment and confirms in the client
* Seller receives fiat payment and confirms in the client
* Funds are transferred to the buyer.

Markets in Bitsquare are fractured and some are very small. So is the SEK market. There seems to be a trade via Swish every other day which is not much at all. EUR market is more liquid for example.
What you can do: 
You can set up your own offers. If they are reasonable they will be taken. Someone has to make a start. The thing is that you have to have your client running for your orders to be visible.

That's a tricky question. My reply would be no. Free, decentralized markets. Everyone should have known what they were buying into and what the risks are. This event is well within expectations. There are warnings all over. It's an unfortunate event for the affected, but in crypto you need to learn responsibility. Never be overinvested, it's risky business. High risk, high reward and high losses.

You could also work for btc or ask a friend. Another option is the lending offer on the bitsquare forum or in-person buys from localbitcoins.

@_date: 2016-06-15 15:12:17
I just had a quick look. Currently, there are no CAD offers.
You could set up offers to buy or sell btc and see if they're taken.
You can trade for (almost) any currency or many altcoins. 
If you wanted to buy with CAD you could set up a OkPay account. You're subject to their fees then. You'd have to send money there. Depending on the amount you want to trade, you'll have to do verification stuff.
You can switch between currencies (fees again) but you'll be able to buy then.
@_date: 2017-01-16 16:44:50
Right, if your offers are reasonable they'll be taken quickly.

Not exactly, and I'm not perfectly sure what's going to come out of recent developments.
What I can tell you is that there is a system in active development, that is going to incentivise contributors. Manfred is still the lone wolf on the dev front, though there's been growing interest and helping hands recently. A new dev is joining full-time right now.
I can't get into more detail because things are changing daily. There should be news once the rebranding's done.


That's because we're not running the platform, the users do. We're not matching trades and don't hold any funds. This would be like asking Bitcoin core contributors to do KYC on every Bitcoin user. Unfortunately, you'll never know what comes to govt peoples minds.
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:49:49

I fully understand your doubts. I'd be suspicious, too.
But nothing of what you suspect is happening. It's just that we wanted to trademark the name, which is impossible due to square already being taken.
If we wouldn't do so now, we'd be asking for serious trouble in the future.
This is why we want to protect a clean name to keep and to be safe for the future. 
Bitsquare is growing constantly and at some point it will raise eyebrows. Let's hope we can stay under the radar until everything needed is sorted out.
Edit: There are no unknown donors. In fact, many investors have been turned away for exactly this reason. We are working on a model to incentivize contributors to speed-up development and I'm sure you'll like it.

Total volume is between 100 and 200BTC a month. You can conveniently trade EUR/BTC or XMR/BTC.
Reasonable volume is very vague. Volume in general is too low. USD/BTC volume is hardly existent. You can't recommend Bitsquare to daytraders but if you want to trade with a high level of privacy and security and live in an active area, Bitsquare is a good spot.

I can give you some insight here:
Most cases for the arbitrator have been caused by simple bugs or user error. At the moment it makes great sense for Manfred to be the only arbitrator which provides for quick support and bug fixing.
There have been a handful of cases where traders tried to get out of a trade when the price moved in an unfortunate direction (Altcoins). If this is exploited to a certain level, the security deposit will have to be raised. 
I'm happy to report that there have been 0 cases of scams like reversed fiat transactions and such. That's a nice stat after 1600 trades in total.
Thanks for your great post!

Bitsquare is a community project. If you want a feature you can voice your need at the [bitsquare forum]( or the [bitsquare github]( 
To have a payment processor added, some work needs to be done. You would need to research the information needed for implementation like [here]( and [here](
These are busy times at Bitsquare, so your support would be appreciated.
Implementation itself would be rather easy if cash deposit qualifies.
@_date: 2016-11-19 20:56:34
Yeah, sorry. I thought it was good enough. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 09:13:54
Addition to 4.:
The trader that has a disadvantage because of the fluctuation can decide to step out of the trade and lose the security deposit. This could be mitigated by raising the security depsoit.
In general: The protocol can always be changed. Exploits of certain weaker payment methods will allways lead to the removal of such. The risks are kept small by protocol design. That being said, the payment methods available are well researched and chosen that exploits are not feasible. A bitfinex event is impossible.
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:46:23
No. It might become an option in the very far future. There are additional risks involved, though.
@_date: 2017-01-01 00:28:34
You can buy or sell btc using cash deposit (at a bank) as (fiat) payment method, yes.
@_date: 2016-11-15 21:34:04
Your argument is pointless all the way.
If you want to buy more that what is offered, then setup your own offer, for as many whatever you want to buy and using the payment method you want. If you stay reasonable, it will be taken.
Edit: Grammar

This update fixes a critical bug in the Bitcoin wallet. It also uses the new BitcoinAverage API as the old API will not be supported anymore soon.
Please update as soon as possible!
Release notes 0.4.9.8:
* Added Crown, Pascal Coin, Smileycoin, RealEst. Coin
* Now all traffic is going over Tor (price requests from Poloniex could not be routed over Tor because they use Cloudflare)
* Added request to CoinMarketCap to get more prices for altcoins not listed at Poloniex
* Use 2 proxy price feed providers as hidden service for requesting accumulated BitcoinAverage (new API), Poloniex and CoinMarketCap price data
* Add program argument to add custom price feed providers
* Add module for running a own proxy price feed provider (requires BitcoinAverage API keys). Supports both clearnet and hidden service
* Display time of latest price update at tooltip over provider icon in market price widget
* Remove http proxy option because it is not needed anymore (Cloudflare issue with Poloniex solved by the proxy)
* Remove tor bridge support (was not solving GFW issues and caused only problems when connections to Tor failed at startup)
* Add option for setting custom bitcoin nodes in network settings (additional possible via program argument)
* Add new block explorers to settings
* Increase max. trade period for US postal money order to 8 days
* Use default btc format (allow more then 4 decimal places)

As I've put it in another comment, the transaction fees used in Bitsquare are perfectly fine. The fees used by users to fund transactions are insufficient at times.
RBF puts a whole new dimension to the trading protocol and is a nightmare to implement, while the benefits are miniscule.

Thanks for your opinion. 
There's a lot to be done and dev ressources are scarce. 
APIs are in development but this may take a while. At the moment there's an 'incentive structure' in the making which should speed-up development. As I just said, there's so much to be done atm.
This being said, Bitsquare should be seen as a platform, on which you can build crazy things in the future.
@_date: 2016-11-18 23:40:10
Nah, there's more to it. If I get you right, you mean that people set-up offers to buy btc with fiat without paying if the offer gets taken?
There are fees to prevent sibyl attacks and there's the security deposit that is lost if someone doesn't follow-up.

Yes, it's bashing and not facts. It's a fact that it's working great in other parts of the world. I can get a reasonable trade at any time. My offers get taken quickly. The overall volume is up.


No vc funding at Bitsquare.


That's just plain FUD! There are hundreds of BTC waiting to be sold and bought on Bitsquare. You can trade for many fiat currencies around the world or you can buy/sell for one of the more than 100 altcoins offered.
I didn't read about security and privacy in your posts. You might not really understand what Bitsquare is about.


I haven't read a single one.

On and off ramps work in a P2P way. You choose the payment processor that you like to use. The information needed is stored locally, encrypted on your machine. The info needed to send fiat is shared with your trade partner (and only her/him) when an offer is accepted. 
The fees are 0.001BTC when you take an offer and 0.0005 when your offer is taken from the offerbook.
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:15:10
You can't trade if you don't have BTC for fee+security deposit.
What I'd do is that I'd ask a friend or family to give me some for the 1st trade. 
Additionally, you can find a useful thread in the [Bitsquare forum]( People can borrow the BTC needed for the first trade there. No one did so, yet afaik.

Bitsquare pays &gt;50sat/byte which is perfectly fine.  
Also, transactions don't need to be in the next block (which they usually (&gt;90%) are).
The only thing causing problems is users funding their trades with insufficient fees.

@_date: 2016-11-02 21:02:25
I don't doubt what you say but do you have a source?
Do you know of cases where that happened?
I can imagine all payment processors in Canada and the US are by law required to provide that functionality (consumer protection).
Btw, by design Bitsquare protects you in different ways. One component of preventing payments with hacked accounts is the trade limit. If a scammer gets hold of an account he/she would for sure go to gain as much as possible and not one time 700$.
Thanks for your input. It'd be nice if you could provide a source for the above.

You skipped my question, though. You might want to answer it now:

Why do you feel like coming to every Bitsquare thread and talk negatively?
@_date: 2016-11-06 18:13:27


It might be that if Bitsquare offers a use case to you that you like, then you use it, and if it doesn't, you don't use it.
Example: You like the concept of decentralization, privacy, censorship resistance, open source, P2P and at the same time are not a day trader, you might want to try Bitsquare to buy and sell BTC for Fiat.
Or: You have BTC and want to buy one of over 100 offered Altcoins. You want to keep a very high level of anonymity and at the same time don't want to expose your BTC to possible theft (finex, gox, ...), you might want to use Bitsquare.
I agree that liquidity is a thing. It needs a couple of people to provide some to get started. It's a shame there aren't any in the US.

This info is stored encrypted and locally. Only your trade partner gets to see it. The info is shared via Tor. The transfer happens like every other fiat transfer outside of the protocol. Let's hope you'll get a trade soon. Thanks for using it! 
@_date: 2016-11-19 11:35:57


It's really not necessary due to Bitsquare's security model. I can't write it all down right now but  generally speaking it's the combination of sufficiently hard to reverse payment methods, fees, security deposit, minimizing incentives for fraudsters, arbitration, multi-sig, Tor, Encryption, clever protocol...


Great to hear you liked the experience. 
As I said before, trade limits are a feature and should probably be renamed. The thought behind it is, that if someone gets ahold of stolen banking information, he's going to try to maximise his/her profits and preferably in single transactions.
BTC/Altcoin limits will be raised step by step as these are safe (I think the limit is 3BTC already).
Thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2016-11-13 01:14:03
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:05:48


true, Bitsquare protects traders in many different ways. One key component is the trade limit.
As you pointed out: 'possibly because it's not worth their time'
@_date: 2016-11-01 10:35:16


No, there's no reputation system needed. The supported payment methods are sufficiently hard to reverse and the trading protocol protects you as well. What you call 'reputation' is just there for ease of mind, so to speak. Additioally, it's only stored locally on your machine.


That's not the whole truth.
In the recent 3 months, trading volume was above 100BTC with August beinge close to 300BTC.
That's not exactly no one. I use it to conveniently buy and sell while protecting my privacy. I always find reasonable buys and sells and I don't know any exchanges where I can find better rates, taking fees and stuff into account.
That being said, you're still right to a certain extent, as liquidity is missing indeed.
**As always, if you don't like the offers, put some up yourself.**  
@_date: 2016-12-21 14:07:50
Cash deposit seems popular in the US. 
What do you mean by 0 for 2?
clearxchange seems to be working fine for its users.
@_date: 2016-11-21 09:29:22


This is a very simple way to put it.


You probably mean that escrow/arbitration is centralized, which would be correct. The decentralized arbitration model is work in progress and will be completed when there are more dev ressources available.


The problem with stuck trades is: when there's a backlog in transaction confirmations, it happens that people funding their trades from external wallets, use insuffiecient fees. The fees Bitsquare uses are sufficient. It's a user error. I acknowledge that it's a flaw in the protocol, that this is possible. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:30:06


The point of a decentralized exchange is that it's censorship resistant, privacy protecting and secure. You can't have that as long as you create single points of failures.
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:34:21
No deposits, just transfers from one peer to the other as in P2P.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:02:44
I don't necessarily disagree, I rather wanted to point out that completely decentralized exchanges serve a purpose. They can exist in environments that censor (outlaw) crypto trading. The can't be urged to collect user data and if you create an elaborate incentive structure on top of a secure network, are the most secure.
I wish you good luck for your exciting endeavours.

@_date: 2017-11-02 21:56:54


Is not what gives Bitcoin value. What gives it value is it's trustless setup. It's also the hardest thing to wrap your head around because it's abstract to us, it's new. It's ironical that we trust banks with our money, an institution  that takes your money and doesn't feel a need to hodl more than 3-5% of it and gamble the rest away. If it happens that they gambled all of it away, there are governments backing them up with hundreds of billions USD/EUR/GBP... of again YOUR money (taxes). That actually happens a lot: 
Banks get away with it because guns and numbness of the people. Many just don't think or know about that kind of stuff.
Bitcoin takes away the need of trust and third parties. This is why it's so important to run your own node, you no longer have to trust. The rest is all well-balanced incentives that keep participants in line.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:23:09


That's just part of the truth. People also want it for a ton of other reasons like censorship resistance, immutability, pseudonomity, remittances...
The rise in value is just a logical consequence of more and more people being exposed to the many upsides of a decentralized value transfer system.
@_date: 2017-04-17 18:33:50

Fiat overlords have no way to tell their transfers are used to buy btc. The txs are p2p with obfuscated payment reasons.
@_date: 2017-04-24 09:33:15
My point is that it doesn't matter where you locate your centralized exchange, you'll eventually be subject to censorship.


I'm pretty sure it doesn't really matter. Centralized exchanges will provide all the information about customers when they're asked to (Coinbase - IRS).
You can't argue that your financial privacy is better protected by regular exchanges. 
There are ways to obfuscate your activity but your actions might be taxable. 
Once your trading reaches a certain threshhold, you might be compelled to open a business account. There's still nothing wrong with the concept of a decentralized exchange.
The only alternative would be cash for btc but that comes with several additional risks and is not everyone's thing.
@_date: 2017-04-23 17:16:04
Centralized exchanges will always be taken advantage of by malicious actors, independent from their geographical location. Centralization is a key flaw in service design and failure is to be expected.

I'm not Manfred but I can answer this. BTC will remain the base currency for the near future. The todo list is incredibly long.

Wire transfer is not supported anymore. If you're talking US wire transfer, it has been abandoned for unreasonably high costs. Wire transfer is NOT reversible. If you mean US ACH, yes, reversible and not supported. If you're asking about SEPA, sufficiently hard to reverse and successfully supported by a number of exchanges.
@_date: 2016-10-31 21:33:50
Fees are as small as possible at the moment and don't really earn money: 0.0005 for makers and 0.001 for takers equaling 0.35$/0.75$US per trade. These should be the lowest fees in the market if you trade more than 35$US/70$US
The main purpose of the fee is to prevent spam.
There's gonna be a model to reward contributions to Bitsquare in the not so distant future. This should push things forward.

You don't speak to the other party, You don't need to. Trust is replaced by protocol/code design. 
That's the beauty of it.
If you want to trade fiat you have to store account details locally in the bitsquare software. Once an offer is accepted only trade partners reveal their information to each other, p2p. no one else will ever know.
No due diligence, that's an acient concept of the old world ;-)

Bitsquare is a decentralized, p2p desktop client. Native Tor implemented. Bitsquare NEVER holds user funds. Think bittorrent and of course bitcoin.
What happened to shapeshift recently couldn't happen with bitsquare.
Shapeshift doesn't offer fiat trading. The btc and altcoin stuff is the easy part.
New altcoin implementation is quick and easy. 50+ supported right now. even the dao tokens will be tradeable after the 28th of may
You keep btc-funds in ~~the~~ your local bitsquare wallet. for a trade they are transferred to a 2-3ms trading wallet.
Other crypto funds are traded directly from local cryptowallet to local cryptowallet.
Fiat is processed in traditional manner via bank transfer or other payment processors (okpay,alipay...)

@_date: 2016-05-27 08:14:35
First of all, thank you for your input. Since you gave me such an elaborated reply, I'm gonna take the time and adress your concerns in detail:




Then 1 week later the bank will phone me up and explain that a fraudulent payment has just entered my bank and that it is being reversed...... 
Chose a payment option that can't be reversed like Okpay. If you're in the US try using a vpn. SEPA bank transfers are sufficiently hard to reverse. I talked to several banks and actively tried to reverse SEPA payments (between friends to test), and couldn't get it done. Reports of reversals are very rare.


Unless the design is changed this will become a sess pool of scamming. a hacker gets a list of bank account passwords. using bitsquare rather than having to fully manufacture a heap of other indenity/verification papers etc to go with it they now need need to make a payment from any bank account they have access to.
There are measures in place to prevent (disincentivize) that like trade limits. I acknowledge the problem, though.


FYI - No scamming attempts until know.


That's ok, bitsquare is not for everyone at anytime, especially in this early stage. Thanks again for sharing your concerns.


Im not trying to pick this project apart. Im trying to provide some constructive criticism. 


I feel you have a limited view. I mentionned SEPA before. Exchanges like bitcoin.de use p2p bank transfers successfully for many years.


For alt coin/btc trades. THIS IS PERFECT. its the fiat part that WONT WORK.


I completely agree with your last paragraph. The banking and fiat system (showing it's worst in the US) is fucked.

That's what I learned like two years ago. Bitcoin is supposed to be treated like an asset in Germany. If you buy a chunk of gold (or bitcoins) and have it lying around for more than a year before you sell it, your earnings (capital gains) are tax-exempt. See [here](

Dash is a Bitcoin clone and can quite easily be added. If we integrate Dash as base currency into the Bisq exchange network we lower the chance of being forked.
We would love to enable an XMR base currency market, unfortunately Monero has not much in common with Bitcoin from a technical perspective. One crucial feature that is missing is a multi-sig function. Without it, Bisq doesn't work. Furthermore Bisq uses bitcoinj. It would be lots of effort to create that market even if there was a multi-sig function. 
BTC based currencies will be the first. 
It's similar for ETH integration, too much workload for the moment.

If you would have looked into it more thouroughly you would have realized that the exchange experience won't be complicated at all. If you agree to use a payment provider like OkCoin (or same bank sepa), fiat funds are immediately transferred and in the Bitsquare software you'll have to wait for 1 confirmation at one point. So the whole thing could be done within a couple of minutes and a couple of clicks.
@_date: 2015-10-22 10:18:18
Same here to be honest.
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:11:07
Yeah, coinffeine is different. You can find relevant posts here: 
Bitsquare uses 2-3 Multi-Sig wallets with one key in the hands of an arbitrator (randomly chosen from an arbitrator pool). If there's a dispute, the cheated party can call for an arbitrator. The arbitrator will have to find out who's right or wrong. Together with the cheated party they can move the funds.
Please review our security model in the linked papers above.
@_date: 2015-02-04 09:58:54
this question got asked at bitcointalk.org. Here are the relevant answers:
Coinffeine is a company, a startup business model, which we're not. Bitsquare is a non-profit, supposed to be from the community for the community. We take decentralization seriously, our main focus is to avoid single points of failure.
Coinffeine are essentially paid by investors, like in their first funding round by the spanish bank bankinter: 
As you can see in their blog  they are on the look for more vc capital in NYC. In fact Coinffeine considers banks as clients:
That wouldn't be acceptable for Bitsquare.
Bitsquare will hopefully be paid for by the community that it's aimed at. We actually made a start by working and paying for v0.1, including fuctional public software.
Last time I checked, Coinffeine didn't do public testing. (they do closed testing, I'm not sure if that has changed yet)
Coinffeine uses micro-payment channels to mitigate risk of fraud, whereas our protection system is a combination of security deposits and a decentralized arbitration system: 
Coinffein will use OKPay as fiat payment processor. Bitsquare will support most if not all 'hard' payment methods 
I made this post to answer your question, to show the differences there are even if they use the same terminology like we do. I, by no means, want to discredit Coinffeine. 
The main concern I see with Coinffeine is that they use that micropayment on the Fiat side, that means you have a high number of small fiat payments between 2 accounts of the same payment processor. 
That is a pattern which even the dumbest monitoring system will be able to track and so the payment processor or bank will know exactly that those 2 account holders are involved in a BTC exchange. 
Who else make hundreds of 1 EUR payents in 1 minute?
So the Single point of failure test will fail as you are dependent on that payment processor/bank to support bitcoin and you lose your privacy. 
Furthermore it is limited to OKPay so both traders need an account there. They plan to add more paymnet options/banks, but I cannot image that there will be a big variety (they need an open banking API which is normally not available beside a few modern payment processors). Also I think it will not be possible between different banks due the cost structure of the micropayments. Micropayments can be cheap inside one bank as its only an internal database entry change, but as soon you leave the bank you have higher costs and delays.
It is an exchange model built for banks to letting them take part in the bitcoin exchange business without getting involved directly with Bitcoin (see interview with CEO:  
Its an interesting business model for banks but has nothing to do with the idea of decentralisation.
It is good to have additional exchange models like Coinffeine but as I said it is not decentralized. 
I see it similar to those attempts to include an exchange into the banking account like some banks have tried it (and got closed again after regulatory pressure).  is one example for such...

Yes, donators have to revoke their pledge manually.
Collection of the pledges would be unfair to all parties because we couldn't hold our promises without funding of the full amount.
@_date: 2015-02-09 16:30:06
Not necessarily a scam but not secure either, see Bitstamp.
@_date: 2015-02-09 15:44:10
I'm still not sure what you mean, sorry. The incentive to donate should be that you want a decentralized exchange to happen because you have a use for it. Even if you don't, you might want to support p2p projects to come to life because centralization causes failure. You can't have full certainity that Bitsquare will be finished if the goal is reached, but we have proven we can build it with a functional v0.1. We put more than one year of unpaid work, passion and personal money in to gain confidence in our project. Once you donate more than 1btc you'll get a nice little reward (a Bitsquare woodwallet) if you decide to provide us with a postal address.
If I still didn't answer your question, please keep rephrasing...

@_date: 2015-02-12 00:06:42


That is correct.
@_date: 2017-05-25 22:20:40
Disclaimer: I'm involved with Bitsquare to some extent.
Firstly, I'd like to say that all Bitsquare traffic is routed over Tor.
A major factor for the lack of support is the lack of incentives. 
Building a decentralized exchange is an expensive and difficult endeavour. You need highly skilled devs who are willing to work for altruistic motives. 
The only revenue you can have while buidling the basic functions are donations. Devs and team need to stay independent from investors. At Bitsquare we've been turning down investment offers for the last years. 
In order to keep such a project decentralized you have to make sure that you don't create central points of failure. Easy money is made elsewhere.
Right now we're in the process of creating a revenue model to incentivise contributors. There will be news about that soon.

Do you have suggestions for better advertising? Many news outlets just ignored our inquireries, although some were really supportive. We hoped the campaign would gain some momentum and people would push us further.
Extending the donation period isn't an option because we have to come to a decision right now as we maxed out our savings. If we fail our main devs will have to get a paid job and development will slow down significantly. I'm still hoping though :-)

You're free to donate or not. You're free to donate as much as you can and want. Our personal savings have dried out (lead dev, 12 months unpaid work) creating the functional alpha version.
To finish the project in a reasonable time frame, main devs need to work on Bitsquare full-time. How do you expect them to make a living? How should we cover legal expenses? No one's getting rich from our funding model.

For now, there are no plans to do so. The funding model has it's flaws, e. g. that if the first two milestones get funded and the third won't, some people might have donated a lot and we couldn't hold our promises. That would be bad for everyone.
If people still want to donate, they can do so via our website. Please just don't peg any expectations to it.
Oh, a donation of one or two skilled java devs would help a lot :-)
Bitsquare will most likely find a way to come into existence but development will slow down. I personally think it's just too important to die.

One-Click. If that's too much, Bitsquare is not for you.

Bitsquare doesn't touch fiat/altcoins/btc (an arbitrator has one key of a 2-3 multisig to be able to intervene in case of fraud).
Fiat is transferred Peer to Peer with whatever payment method you agreed to.
Banks can't block fiat transactions as they can't tell bitsquare related transactions apart from other ones. You get a combination of letters and numbers to use as 'reason for payment'.
Edit: Other cryptocurrencies are transferred from altcoin-wallet to altcoin-wallet.
@_date: 2015-02-05 19:15:17
You're right, fundraising for each milestone. It isn't carved in stone though under certain circumstances things might change. If we don't reach quota we'll get nothing. 
We don't really have an idea of what to do if it fails.
It would be awesome if you had any idea of how to do it better.
I think it's a great approach to fund a project with the help of the community it is aimed at. We have no plans to monetize Bitsquare as a platform. Spending of the funds will be 100% transparent. 120btc sounds like a lot, but it doesn't account for average payment of the people involved and not for legal advice or anything extra. Not for the development of the Alpha version that took 1 full-time dev 1 year and another full-time (keep in mind: no income) for 6 months and several people helping.
@_date: 2016-07-01 22:27:51

You must have misunderstood something. From the FAQ:
**How much does it cost to trade on Bitsquare?**
*A small fee of 0.0005 BTC when creating an offer and 0.001 BTC when taking an offer is paid to Bitsquare’s arbitrators for their service availability.* 
*Further, this fee discourages spam and market manipulation. A security deposit of 0.01 BTC is required by all traders to participate in a transaction, but the deposits are fully refunded to both parties after a successful trade.*
*Other potential costs you may encounter are miner’s fees to transfer cryptocurrency, or banking fees to transfer national currency.*

Not so much liquidity. You gotta start somewhere. The experience is said to be smooth and easy to use. No security incidents (~500-600 trades).
The experience pretty much depends on the fiat payment methods you can use. SEPA for the eurozone and okpay work flawlessly.
@_date: 2016-07-05 15:08:42
Yes, that is there that people follow the protocol more quickly. If there wasn't a limitation people could just leave the money in limbo or the arbitrator would have to be called every time.
If you're a btc buyer and you prove that you paid, you can call the arbitrator after the max trade duration expires. You'll receive the btc and the seller loses his security deposit.
If you're the seller and you don't receive the payment, you can call the arbitrator after max trade duration and you'll get your btc back (+the buyer's sec. deposit but I'm not 100% sure about that).

You have several options, depending on where you are from: 
* SEPA
* National bank transfer, Same bank transfer, Transfer with specific banks
* Okpay
* Perfect Money
* Swish
* Alipay
You can't meet in person. 
Anonymity: Depends on who you want to share your identity with. For bank transfers you'll have to share your bank account details with only your trading peer. If you prefer not to do this you could use another payment processor whom you'd have to do AML/KYC with. (hint: you did this with your bank as well)


Security is key for Bitsquare. It's the protocol that makes it secure. It's a whole new level of privacy and security in comparison to traditional centralized exchanges. If you're interested, please read the white paper and the FAQ that you can find on the [website](

Yeah, you're right. Bitsquare is not for daytraders. You can do quick trades using a payment processor that transfers fiat instantly. You're still dependant on blockchain confirmations though, as you trade real money and not funny numbers on screens.
Maybe somebody will build a layer on top of Bitsquare that enables daytrading, it's not unthinkable, but you'll be trading 'funny numbers on screens' there as well.
It's easy to build an exchange and offer lightning fast trading. You'll always be at risk when trading there as centralized exchanges are all times at risk to lose customer funds.

That's great to hear, enjoy.
As I said elsewhere today, lack of liquidity is a main concern right now. When I put up reasonable offers to sell btc they get taken pretty quickly.
@_date: 2016-07-19 21:02:58
@_date: 2016-07-04 19:31:16
That's not true. You can make multiple buys. The restriction only applies for single trades.
The biggest problem right now is liquidity and reliable payment methods for US users.
Another one would be accessability for Chinese from behind the great firewall. (solved in theory)
@_date: 2016-07-05 16:47:14
Lifted? Probably, but not within the next weeks. 
Removed? Not in the existing environment. The trading model has to prove being secure. That's a rather slow process. Lifting the trade limit means becoming more attractive to scammers.
At the moment you can put up multiple offers (as many as you can handle). Setting up offers is a matter of seconds if you are doing the same ones multiple times. Please do so as liquidity is lacking severely.
I hope there'll be an option soon that renews offers as they are taken as long as your wallet has coins in it.
@_date: 2016-07-28 11:02:40
That's great to hear. Liquidity is still a concern though. Let's hope you find a decent offer.

Decentralized crypto-fiat exchange is a possible use case. SEPA bank transfers are considered hard-to-reverse. I'm aware the situation in the USA (and Canada) is different. A combination of measures to minimize incentives for fraud can provide sufficient security.
At Bitsquare.io we plan to implement TLSNotary as instrument for Arbitrators.

Well, there's a new kid in town.

Okpay don't do chargebacks. SEPA's sufficiently hard to reverse.

Yen is supported already. No offers at the moment. If you can provide liquidity, please do.

So go with bitsquare.io then.

Did you try version v0.4.8.1? The bug is known and should be fixed by now. It works for me.
@_date: 2016-07-06 15:07:14


I agree 100%. It's one of our main goals. There's still a lot of room for imrovement usability wise.


Originally it was thought to be a trading tool for early adopters. It's not perfect for 1st timers anyway since you initially need some btc for the security deposit.
@_date: 2016-07-26 23:57:32
Bitsquare was first.

Bitcoin.de has similarities and I've had no bad experience with them. A main difference is that bitcoin.de holds your btc and you have to do all this AML/KYC stuff.
Regarding bitsquare: If you want to have quicker transfers you can use payment processors that do instant fiat transfers. You're still depending on confirmations as you're trading btc from and to your personal wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-03 19:47:20
That being said, arbitration is the thing we want to avoid. Regular users shouldn't come into contact with arbiter, just in case of scam attempts.
Like 99% of arbitrated cases are due to technical issues (bugs and user error). This is expected as the trading protocol incentivises honest traders.
@_date: 2016-07-07 07:42:23
You have to determine the risk level yourself. Privacy is harmed way more on traditional exchanges. The only way to be completely private is face to face trading. You gotta make sure no one follows you and takes your picture, though. Tell your trading peer to only use new, unmarked fiat notes with random serial numbers. Use gloves, wear a hat and sunglasses. Only buy and sell self-mined coins...
You have to draw a line somwhere. Put it in relation to what you're doing. To sell/buy 1000s of coins you'd have to take different measures than when selling/buying 1btc.
Otherwise use Okpay then. This way you're sharing a 'random' string of letters and numbers with your trading peer. You'll have to trust Okpay, though as you have to get AML/KYC verified there.

I'm a bit lost on that one. Maybe just try again. Usually it just works.
I'll try to figure it out and let you know. Thanks for trying.
@_date: 2016-07-24 23:40:07
If you use okpay, you actually have the trust hub you want.
Personally, I don't think you'll be safer and you have additional KYC/AML and fees. On the other hand you have instant fiat transfer and more privacy regarding trading peers.

Fiat is transferred p2p. Bitsquare doesn't touch it.
I'm sure you did all you AML/KYC with your bank account. 
Alternatively, you could use a payment processor like okpay. But that's only a good option if you either trade very small amounts or do AML/KYC verification there. Main advantages of okpay are instant money transfers and minimal privacy exposure to your trading peer. You just share your okpay account number.
@_date: 2016-07-29 21:45:20


The 0.01 BTC is the security deposit:
The security deposit is part of every trade. Seller AND buyer, both pay 0.01 BTC to the multi-sig adress where the traded BTC go to. After a successful trade, both trading peers receive their security deposit (0.01) back.
This is meant as incentive to follow the trade protocol, i. e. don't cheat.
Trading fees are just 0.0005 BTC for creating an offer and 0.001 for taking an offer. This is just above the blockchain transaction fee and very low.
**In case of a dispute:**
One trader does not follow the trading protocol (e. g. does not pay) the other trader, the honest one, can call the arbitrator. The arbitrator decides the case in favor of the honest trader and keeps the security deposit of the cheater as compensation for his service.
In the future the honest trader might receive the security deposit as compensation of the hassle. There is no final decision about this yet.
Feel free to ask if you've got anything else. Bitsquare can seem a bit complicated but when you start trading it's really secure, intuitive and easy. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 18:12:57
Please make sure you use the right version (32 vs 64bit) for your windows system.

Sorry, you have no point here. To install Bitsquare it's a single click. 
To trade on any centralized exchange you have to sign-up, scan and share sensitive documents with random people, comply with any demands because otherwise they hold your money hostage.
You'll have the police force come and raid your house if someone decides to check if the coins you buy or sell are related to 'drugs' or 'terrorism'. 
Or maybe you signed up to an exit-scam or one of the exchanges employees decides to run with your money. 
Bitsquare is just an option, and a desktop client is the way to go for the sake of decentralization, security and individual sovereignty.
@_date: 2016-07-06 19:51:40
To be more precise: Coins are locked in a 2-3 multi-sig wallet. Seller, buyer and arbitrator each 'control' one key. As a user you're not exposed to that process. You're basically confirming your actions (accept trade contract, sent payment, received payment) which automatically releases the coins if the protocol is followed as intended. 
Only if there's a problem, an arbitrator steps in and enforces his decision about the case. Coins are released with the arbitrator's key and the honest trade partner's key.
Thanks for sharing your blog post, that's awesome!

Use Bitsquare and you have no third party to rely on. Trade limit is 2 BTC per trade, so in this case it's probably not perfectly suited.

I can think of countless examples on how trees (as in plants) or trees (structural) affect the minds of people positively, just think of it's beauty, it's structure and build. Everyone on earth profits of the benefits trees provide (physical or not) and no one, even negative minds, can't run from that. If trees affect the physical aspect more than mind is up to interpretation.

Now that's confusing. As 'plzsendmetehcodez' has supposed, money being sent is locked and 'becomes part  of a miraculous worldwide flux of money', while on the other hand the banks should already be able to do that all the time because, how you are supposing, 'the money stopped being yours the moment you deposited it at the bank'.
There should be no reason to lock it when you transfer it.

Yo bro, you clearly have not spent a single minute exploring what Bitsquare actually is and what possibilities arise.
If you don't want to share your bank info with a trading partner you can choose a different payment processor. E.g. if you decide to use okpay, the only info you share is a string of letters and numbers.
BTC-Crypto trading doesn't need any info besides an adress.

Are you aware that your findings have a lot in common with the concept of 'Positivism' (a philosophy of science and a creation of Auguste Comte).
The role of Positivism in science today is interesting and kinda closes a circle with the offer of a bitcoin (and the concept behind the implementation of its protocol).

i think you mean that by spreading a positive message you can unify everyone. I think that can be supported by being a role model and lead a way to positivity. 
A positive mental attitude by the way is a neat concept spread around  in the Hardcore/Punk community (well, parts of it). I find that very appealing and live by that.
