in theory maybe, but in practice i think not. Are there even any easy crypto transfer solutions that work simply with non-android/non-apple low-end phones? Then further, why should those people who are very uneducated (quite possibly illiterate) use a more complicated transaction system instead that is more prone to give non-technically adept people issues and provides less security in the case of purchased goods having issues?  
Now, I get that in situations where gov fiat in untrustworthy that it's an excellent option, and that's great, but again, I don't think the poorest Venezuelan farmers are using crypto, only the more educated ones.   
China is an interesting example, crypto could work very well there, but it's not used significantly. instead people are using wechat pay, a standard database transactional system, it's already succeeded in the way crypto wants to.

I was looking at the World bank report, that's where the 1.7B number comes from.     
But also I travel a lot, I've been to about 50 countries, including rural China which has the greatest number of unbanked, and I can definitively say from my experience that the vast majority of people globally have banking access. If you think about it there's really no way there would only be 1.5B with bank accounts  
I don't like getting my news from videos, painfully slow and emotional, but I'll read more of AAs stuff when I get the chance. 
If you can provide a source showing that 6B people don't have banking access Im interested to read it.

I definitely agree it'll be interesting. Not sure how good it will be for me (in the US); but it's a natural evolution of currency so there's no evading it. We're most likely going to be entering a new global recession, i think altcoins certainly have a place in this regard. Coins that are traded in grey or black markets can't be constrained, while gov backed white coins are likely to be the least valued.

Well that's a pretty obscure definition, I mean it's probably true but only because most people don't care about having international fiat. And having crypto doesn't give you access to international fiat either so it doesn't make much sense.  
Regarding the "just" 1.7B, that's definitely relevant, but to be realistic it's a lot lower. For example 0.8B are illiterate, they are not going to be using crypto. We can even expand that, 1.1B earn less than $2 a day, they cannot afford a device to use crypto. Heck, the bottom 5.3B earn less than $10 a day. What does the bottom 1.7B earn, I'm guessing an average of $3 a day, I don't see crypto being accessible to many them.  
You might argue that they have a lower cost of living, and thats true, but they have virtually no savings. And when you are only earning $3 a day even the the fees on cheap altcoins like BCH of an average of $0.01 would end up being quite substantial for day to day use. If you made 6 transations with  a $0.01 fee a day that would be a 3% average fee. And bitcoin would be crazy.

People say that because every person they convince to invest in BTC increases it's value, it's entirely to increase their own value. The way BTC may eventually hit 100k+ is not going to be from it increasing in value. If it ever happens it would be from the fiat it's being compared against decreasing in value. For example if the global currency (USD) suddenly dropped in value by 90% it would put the value of btc at 104k USD. But to clarify not all currencies will be affected like this. The value to the RMB might stay the same or even increase for example. An investment in BTC is an investment in the inevitably correct belief of fiat financial failure (historically it has happened to every fiat, even metal based ones). But will that happen soon and to such an extreme level, no.

That's only because the average person has no interest in buying japanese stock so there is no reason to have those features in an average account. And, those sort of trades are accurately considered high-risk so banks aren't legally allowed to try to push them on normal accounts. Besides you can't do that with btc anyhow... And even if you could Japan would be an exception, most countries you still couldn't. 
People who have bank accounts have access to banking, it's that simple. And among those without bank accounts the majority don't have them because they don't keep savings, they have no use for btc either. 
Your definition of being banked is a fantasy, it will never be like that. And you're not a bank yourself, there's legal meaning to that.

Not really. We know the maximum number of bitcoins in existence, which limits inflation. We only have a rough estimate of how much bitcoin is in existence as lost coins which amount to about ~25% cannot be used. We also know the current about of various fiat in existence, you can google it for any currency. Worse than what you suggest though is that we also know the amount of inflation and it does not affect crypto due to low production.

Findex doesn't only count heads of households it also has an individual count. That's why there is a discrepency between the now 2.3B and 1.7B. Many women don't have accounts because they share their partners, so while they don't have an account they do have access.   
This is interesting "To shed light on why people are unbanked, the 2017 Global Findex survey asked adults  without  a  financial  institution  account  why  they  do  not  have  one.  Most  offered two reasons. The most common one was having too little money to use an account. Two-thirds cited this as a reason for not having a financial institution account,  and  roughly  a  fifth  cited  it  as  the  sole  reason.  Cost  and  distance  were  each  cited  by  about  a  quarter  of  those  responding  to  the  question,  and  a  simi-lar share said they do not have an account because a family member already has one. Lack of documentation and distrust in the financial system were both cited by roughly a fifth of adults without a financial institution account, and religious concerns by 6 percent."   
Regarding the primary reason for not having an account of not having enough money; crypto won't help with that.  
Not trying to attack crypto, I do think the deregulated nature of being able to create an account and transfer is good. Just not convinced it will actually help the people the people AA is saying it will.

There's no such thing as indestructible.  
In the case of an earthquake, fire, or solar flare the trezor in it's indestructible case will be destroyed, gold will be just fine.  
Theoretically is a known vulnerability, and like I mentioned before there are other known vulnerabilities. And there are certainly many unknown vulnerabilities. 
You can't theoretically hack into the computerized network securing the gold vault because vaults are not computerized. And the gold ownership isn't going to be accepted as being yours.  
  
In the case of bitcoin private keys brute-forcing them can definitely be done, "theoretically" just refers to it taking a very long time.
Bottom line BTC and Trezor are digitally insecure compared to gold.

New divisions can be made perpetually. you could make 21,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 mSats for example. outside of value there is no difference between 1 BTC and 1 Sat. Or similarly you can go the opposite directiong, there are only 21,000 kBTC, or 21 MBTC, or 0.021 BBTC that doesn't make them scarce.
This is dissimilar to gold because some gold is permanently lost when it is used in manufacturing. The supply of gold will go down forever until it is nothing. With BTC the supply only goes down when people lose it. But if 20,999,999 BTC were lost the remaining 1 could still be used just fine if it were broken up into trillionths of a sat.

The tech itself is valueless, so if that's what your deriving the price from you'd be better off picking altcoins.  
Strength of the network is pretty vauge, I'm not sure what your definition is, but I definitely wouldn't call the bitcoin network strong since the majority of miners are under control of a brutal authoritarian regime (china).

For gold to vaporize you're going to have to do magnitudes more damage to it than a trezor, sure a nuke could, but nuclear war would probably destroy BTC as well.  
I can't think of a scenario it would be inaccessible, but that would affect your trezor too.
Backing up Bitcoin in the case of a government merely makes it less secure. The more people with access the less secure it is, especially if they are memorizing the seed. Sure you can personally back it up as much as you like, and then when you die it's lost forever, unlike gold.
You can however back up gold perfectly, that's what insurance is for. You're not ever going to get insurance on bitcoin.    
You're being totally ridiculous to suggest that gold is likely to be destroyed.  
Similarly I'm not really sure what your point on recasting gold is, but yeah it can still be tracked (not very well, but neither can bitcoin).

gold doesn't react to oxygen, it doesn't burn if that's what you were thinking. So I'm not sure how you propose to destroy it outside of a close proximity nuclear weapon.   
To be clear I'm not even sure that a nuclear weapon would vaporize gold, I can't find a source on it. The limited results i found basically just say that a nuke would spread out the gold, but not destroy it. 
Either way nobody is going to get a nuke inside a gold vault for the proximity do be sufficiently effective on gold, so realistically gold is indestructible.   
You can't secure bitcoin as well as gold. That's the entire point of our discussion...
... yes gold can be tracked, that's what gold fingerprinting is, they look at trace elemental impurities in the gold to determine the source.  
So you're suggesting Bitcoin can't be hacked, despite it having been hacked, and gold can be hacked despite it not having been hacked... ok...
Even if you ignore the constant inside job hacks that happen to bitcoin, it's known to be hackable in at least the three ways i mentioned above (51% attack, poison blocks, brute-forcing). 
If you want to pretend bitcoin is unhackable then address those three attacks and inside jobs instead of ignoring them.

The only good advice is to invest in all three.   
You need the HYS so that you have cash on hand to deal with day to day expenses (it also protects you from btc loss of value).  
You need the Index funds (and to never withdraw) because they are an almost guaranteed return on investment (they make your other two positions safer).  
The BTC may protect you if your HYS loses value, it may also increase in value on it's own, it is the highest risk position though.  
The complicated question is what percentage of your funds you invest into each. This should be determined by how much you have to spare. Your HYS needs to cover all your expected expenses plus room for outliers. The rest you could reasonably split 50/50 between IF and BTC

That's the secondary way miners make money, a cut of the transactions, but it doesn't produce bitcoin. The primary way is the actual mining which creates new bitcoin. Since halving means miners will be making way less money we can expect bitcoin transaction fees to go up, unless something supports them staying down. So halving can actually reduce the value of bitcoin.

That doesn't really relate though, because it's not sold as Bitcoin. In the image above we see two commodities being sold with three names each.   
Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, BCH and Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core, BTC.  
Your argument that Bitcoin is generic needs to fit this definition "Generic Term Law and Legal Definition
Generic term is a word that is associated with or known as a particular category of goods and services to which it relates. The result is that the term ceases to function as an indicator of origin. A generic word is one used by much of the public to refer to a class or category of product or service. A generic name can not be protected or registered as a trademark or service mark. For example, any single seller can not have trademark rights in “television” or “oven.” When a seller is given exclusive rights to call something by its recognized name, it would amount to a practical monopoly on selling that type of product. Even established trademarks can lose their protection if they are used generically. For example, thermos and aspirin.
"  
So basically for Bitcoin to be generic, BCH has to be a type of Bitcoin, is it? that's complicated. If satoshi came out and said BTC was prior art, then no BCH definitely can't use the term. But if that never happens perhaps you could argue BCH is a type of Bitcoin.   
But perhaps the bigger issue is calling BTC "Bitcoin Core". It's purposeful mislabling to make the product seem like a variation of itself because the actual name is Bitcoin.  
Is "gold" a generic term? it is. So you have "gold" for sale listed on your website.  
Under it you have two types of "gold"
You have Gold Cash (SLV) and Gold Core (GLD).  (in parenthesis are the stock ticker labels)
Naming it what you want just because it's your website doesn't mean it's legal.

That's not deflation. Deflation requires there to be less BTC. People losing wallets equals deflation. It's just lowering inflation. But sure, both arguments are used. If it affects the price of BTC at all it would be before the halving (because it is a known thing to happen), not eventually after.

transaction volume, lol.   
Paypal makes ~3% off of every transaction. That's way more earnings than miners make.  
Comparing bitcoin retail transaction platforms to fiat retail transaction platform shows a very different story.

No, for a couple reasons.  
1. historically the promissory note will say something like good for 1 gram of gold. This is different from gold in that bitcoin is worth X gram of a fluctuating amount of gold. What this means can be interpreted in several ways; such as the value of gold fluctuates as the fiat gains value, or that the value of fiat changes as gold demand/supply changes.
2. historically promissory notes aren't really backed up, they were only partially backed, and runs of fiat would collapse the currency.  
3. The production of the fiat is an investment, initially cost is always negative. Like any crypto initial production has labor and resource costs. You can print billions of $, but until someone accepts it there is no value. The genesis block is an example of this, in that it had electrical costs, but more than that significant labor costs by satoshi. The entire reason btc took so long to generate value was that it was not valuable. The value it has creates future value.

    "they hacked into the bank's computer"

Yah, I agree with that. I was surprised the other redditor didn't argue that, I think it's a much better argument than anything he had.
I suppose the main argument in this case is; yes sourcing of gold is definitely sometimes an issue, but so is sourcing of bitcoin. ex (the bitcoin you received was previously used to commit a murder, or it was stolen, or it was mined illegally). 
To be clear I'm not saying BTC is bad, it has a great many uses and a great many good things. I just think it's terrible as a federal reserve. Imagine this scenario: The political party in power has the federal reserve liquidate 10% of the gold supply into to BTC, then they have their appointed private key carriers refuse to give up the keys when the political party is replaced after the election. Then in response the next political party does the same thing. We end up in a situation where there is no usable financial reserve and where the entirely of the reserve is prone to theft.  
it's not like that situation is impossible with gold or fiat (national debt), just that bitcoin would make the current bad situation worse.

that's the least likely vector of attack, so I wouldn't expect that until a non-public vulnerability is detected.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:02:24
Yes you can, lol.   
Not the same at all, if your btc gets stolen it is unrecoverable.

I was explaining it simply. Not my fault you can't understand that.
@_date: 2019-09-23 07:11:54
mostly yes I would think. But the specific company mentioned in the article with the most negative yield is a manufacturing conglomerate. We can't know what they're doing, but it could be a very bad sign for the global economy. 
(banks doing this isn't that bad, because a bank collapse means little, you go onto the next bank or the next currency, the world can still be ok. But if an international manufacturing congloerate fails it means thousands of businesses will likely fail, affecting a very large number of jobs and the stability of many countries.

there is no bottom, or top. Just like with fiat. It's hanging around 10k because it's settling on its actual value.

It's only ever getting that high if the global economy collapses and the USD inflates to the point that it's worth a percent of what it currently does.

I agree, the big question to me is when, and how it will affect specific countries. people have been predicting this collapse for decades, as a continuation of the 2009 issues. Countries are pretty good at delaying the inevitable.

True, it's an over-simplification, because the person asking doesn't know or probably care.  
    
Interestingly you're the only person that has responded in this way.  
Everyone else is happy saying miners will remain constant because value of btc will be theoretically higher.  
Reality, it will be a mix, btc difficulty per 1 will increase, transaction fees will probably increase substantially (if btc is near it's real value). Thy literally insane hype train on this sub detracts from the value of btc in my mind.

Did you read the attacks i mentioned above?  
A trezor can easily be destroyed, gold can't.  
The private key can be theoretically brute forced.  
The trezor can be a vulnerability itself.
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:22:38
very likely, there's always new vulnerabilities being found and the vulnerabilities don't even have to have anything to do with btc. An issue like Intels Specter could be the downfall of bitcoin.   
The idea that "If all types of encryption get busted.. that'd be an issue but that'd like break the internet" is fundamentally wrong. Not all forms of encryption need to be broken, just the weakest one that allows you to be hacked. And it's not like these kinds of issues haven't happened before, that's why we don't see flash anymore, that's why you see https. The internet is constantly evolving precisely because there are holes to patch.  
Bitcoin has already been lost many many times due to hacking, just search this subreddit. And there are currently known methods of seriously damaging or destroying BTC, like a 51% attack.

Doesn't matter if you stay at home or if you don't buy high-end product variants. The  manufacturing allows for the infrastructure that supports what you have.  High end products also drive development because of their greater ROI. If people only ever bought cost efficient cars we would never see self driving cars (there wouldn't be room for their development).

it's a joke.
The smallest Rial coin is 14 sats or 1 penny.     
Were you expecting a sat to worth less than 1/4 of a penny?   
You can measure btc to usd pennys if you like, it doesn't change the value.
Bitcoin is metric, the reasons sats is popular is it;s close to a penny value.
"The smallest part of bitcoin (BTC) in these countries represents a good investment"   
This is a joke, they are making fun of their readers., 1 penny is absolutely nothing in these places.

Do you think it's stable because it is near it real value, or it is artificially high or artificially low?   
Depends on how you are going to treat it.   
If you treat it as a long term investment you wont touch for 1 year+, then yes i I think it's a good time. (Bitcoin has been pretty consistent in year to year growth in fall months).   
 
If you plan to check btc value daily or weekly and make trades based on the changing value, I would wait for the price to go lower (it definitely will at some point). If you don't wait you are likely to sell emotionally when it inevitably dips in value, especially if it seems to stay there. (I think ~10,020 would be decent to wait for)
