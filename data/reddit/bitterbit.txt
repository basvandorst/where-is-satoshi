Good idea. Please make sure that they know to actually treat that private key even more carefully than money though. They need to understand that passing it around and letting someone take a picture of it with their smartphone is all it would take to completely wipe out the value.

Just curious to see how long it would take for someone to notice and realize what it was. About two minutes it seems! I went back to work, heard the blockchain.info beep in the background, and smiled.

What you're looking at is a private key (see  By importing this key into your wallet you can claim the bitcoins associated with it.
I removed the last two digits as a game for people to try and guess it. With the clue, it's narrowed down to 26*26=676 possibilities.

Another one:

Happy hunting.
edit: I'll narrow it down. Both missing digits are capital letters. And post so we know who claimed the reward!
edit2: Someone got it. The missing digits were HM.

He's saying the grammar is jacked up. Change it to "A more complicated yet equally rewarding utility", if that is in fact what you're trying to say.
@_date: 2013-02-07 22:33:33
You're right, I had originally calculated .1*.96875 - .03125, then realized it should have been 1.1 so I changed it without realizing the math would change too :-(
Thanks for spotting that.

Didn't take long :-)

**edit: the two random digits were selected with an online generator and are not consecutive**
I've randomly removed two digits from a 51-digit private key worth 0.25 BTC which will be posted here at 10:45pm EST.
~~May the best script win!~~ **SOLVED. Congrats to the winner!**

I know, it would be nice if it sat idle for three days then the last person holding it would get their purchase price back, or at least some of it (maybe charge them a 10% "fee" for holding their gem), but I can understand that this might make it unprofitable for the site owner.
edit: After re-reading your post I understand now what you're saying, that the three day rule is in place to encourage the current owner of the gem to spam the bitcoingem.com website in order to get other buyers. Actually a very smart idea (for the site owner) now that I see it that way.
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:41:14
You may be able to get ideas from and/or modify some of the scripts made public above (below?). Also a bit over my skill set as well, so don't feel too bad :-)
@_date: 2013-02-19 04:04:02
I considered that but a script would have to run through only 62*50 iterations to find it. I wanted this one to take a little longer since it's the last one I'm giving away for the evening.
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:56:29
Exactly, once you've correctly guessed the last two digits.
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:36:43
Created. Not sure what to do next though :-)
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:34:11
They will not be marked. I just realized that this may be computationally infeasible, but I don't have enough math/CompSci savvy to say for sure. The winners of the other ones wrote scripts so I figured maybe they'd do the same for this one and let it run overnight.
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:46:55
Congrats :-)

~~I'll be posting another private key worth 0.25 BTC with the last two digits truncated again at 10pm EST.~~

The Better Bitcoin Bureau?
@_date: 2013-04-17 23:42:18
Have at it. I just sent you a moderator invite. I have no experience managing these things and don't think I'll have the time to moderate anyway.
edit: I posted because I just wanted to say "Better Bitcoin Bureau" :-)
@_date: 2013-02-19 03:51:24
Non-consecutive; thanks, I updated the post to make this clear.
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:41:28
I THINK someone may have got it, but I'm not totally sure what's going on... still learning how transactions work myself.
edit: Ok, yep, someone definitely got it! Whoever you are congrats and let us know how you did it!
@_date: 2013-02-10 20:51:54
Thanks for the replies everybody.

At what point would the game become impractical for commodity hardware to solve? (i.e. how many digits truncated?)
@_date: 2013-02-07 22:37:14
Then mathematically, would this mean that as long as you determine (however you would personally determine this) that there is more than a [1-.034375]=96.5625% chance that the gem will be purchased within three days, it is still a +EV decision?
Just to be clear I'm neither encouraging nor discouraging anyone from playing this "game", I'm just interested in the math/reasoning behind it.
