Yea...just did some research and figured that out. I just don't understand how a simple transfer doesn't appear in my wallet and now I've lost money because of it. Coinbase shows it complete but no sign of it in Bitstamp wallet.

I would advise against it. Go look at their subreddit. It is nothing but missing funds posts. They finally responded to my support ticket but it was a generic response saying they are working to resolve the issue.

Interesting. I'm beginning to think the wallet is corrupt? The address has changed from the original address I sent it to. I do not believe there is any malware on my pc (scanned with 3 different programs). The wallet address only has my transaction appearing on the block chain so I don't think it was stolen by a third party.

It would be really interesting to know if he or his firm is engaging in buying bitcoin with their own fiat. Is there any oversight of this or any way to know?

Well yea, in this situation my example isn't really applicable but I just wanted to mention that fiat isn't the only way creditors are repaid. The creditor or creditors can mutually agree to take ownership of the company instead of liquidating assets. This scenario doesn't really work with the amount of individuals involved with Gox but it does when there are a few big banks as creditors. Also, the company would still have to have some value and potential to be profitable in the future for this to work and I don't think Gox would be able to continue operating after this incident. Again, my example doesn't really work when there are thousands upon thousands of creditors.

Not necessarily. At least not in the US. Creditors sometimes will take shares in a company instead of making them sell assets.

I guess you could have hired your own Japanese lawyer to argue on your behalf.
