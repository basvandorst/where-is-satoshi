Bitcoin ATM is probably a cool first experience. Only invest the amount that you're willing to lose/leave locked up inaccessible for 5 years. And dollar-cost average your entry into the coin

Don't think of this as being a wallet issue, but an *address* one. A straight up hard-fork like BCH shared bitcoins entire history. So for example a transaction that occurred in Nov 2012 will be part of both chains history. Likewise if you had an unspent transaction output associated with an address before the fork, it will be there after the fork. It is up to the new coins developers whether they want to honor the entire Bitcoin history, a portion of it, or start a new coin fresh.


If you possess your private key associated wth the Bitcoin address &amp; balance in question, that same private key will work on the new chain to spend those newcoins.


If you have your private keys you don't need to wait until your current wallet does anything, but you do need to wait until *some wallet* works on the new chain. For BCH and BTG forks, my main wallet is Electrum, but I **swept** my private keys from Electrum to Coinomi (Android) to claim my fork coins.

Cloud mining is almost always a scam. Just buy the bitcoin and store it on a private key you control.  For  you're probably not the right person for the job - and you'll know if you are (you have tons of experience running datacenters at low cost/mfg chips for intel/have business or govt connections and can get electricity at below market price/some other very technical and specialized skill)

It's disappointing to see all the new people that are here to speculate. And like "2 weeks it must double!" speculate. Without even a guise of counter-economics behind it.  But I am still bullish bitcoin because there are still a group of neck beard computer scientists with their heads buried in technical problems.  And anyway, when the crash happens, bitcoin will be purified of the non-believers

I have been told mobile OS's have better sandboxing, prevent running apps from accessing info/traffic of other apps.
I know that apps don't have root access, and so can't access certain files/directories (such as where your private keys are stored)

No, there are several solid software wallets... For BTC I use Electrum, and I think they actually have an LTC one too. Not sure for Ethereum, but my point is to be very skeptical when downloading wallets. Assume people are trying to steal from you, until you can confirm that the software has been around for awhile, has solid community support, is open-source, is the official one built by the protocols' developers, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:11:39
It is a good practice for both security and privacy to use a new address for every new transaction, so all (?) modern wallets do that for you by default. You will have access to your old ones still.

Ditch your family.  Have they have been holding you back your whole life?

I am skeptical of collusion. But I assumed the income from fees would be trivial, and I was wrong. I looked at the TX fees for the last 10 blocks and about 20% of total income from these blocks are from tx fees, which is a pretty big deal...   I still am skeptical of overt collusion, but it is interesting that miners and Ver/BCH might have a similar goal of spamming the network and increasing BTC fees

Often times, average people getting in don't know what they are doing, often get in when the hype/price is at a peak, and are vulnerable to scams (of which there are millions of in this space). 
In addition, it can be hard to securely store bitcoin [private keys] for long periods of time for average consumers. Bitcoin has a non-zero risk of "factory reset - lost thousands $"
I agree with most of the rest of the post.

It is advisable to "sweep" private keys from old wallets into new ones, so that the bitcoin that you moved will be under your backup key phrase. Its easy to forget that one or two addresses are not backed up. But unfortunately sweeping initiates a network transaction and so there will be a fee.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:51:31
If you have the actual private key, you can import that into most "real" wallets, as per Bob Allison's link.    If it's a small amount of money, you can just import and leave it at that. If it's a size large enough to warrant the $20 fee, I suggest sending the entire balance from this Rushwallet private key to an address generated by the new wallet (Blockchain.info, Electrum, whichever you settle on). That way, your funds are recoverable with your 12 word back-up phrase (if you are importing a private key from somewhere else, your 12 word phrase will not recover those funds, because that private key was in a random, non-deterministic way)

If your emotional well being is tied to the price, do yourself a favor and leave bitcoin. Stay for the technology and the revolution, not gains

The "number crunching" miners do don't have a computer science/mathematical purpose. It has an economic purpose.
Miners take a hash of the current blocks transactions, a hash of the previous block, and a random number (a nonce) and repeatedly run the same operation on them. The nonce is changed each iteration until the final number they end up with is within the "target range." The reason they do this is because its expensive in real-world resources (money/electricity) to do.
Also, disambiguate between transactions/blocks and transaction speed/average block time.

No, hard-forks do not invalidate bitcoins mined *before* the hard fork.  
If you read up on the BCH hard-fork, you'll see that everyone who had bitcoin before Aug 1 then had that same Bitcoin on the main chain and a corresponding balance on the BCH chain.
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:56:12
The biggest difference between bitcoin and real-life trading is that bitcoin has centralized-exchange risk. The NASDAQ and NYSE effectively don't.
You can spend two years in bitcoin successfully grinding out daily wins, debating on the forums the merits of this strategy or that, and reading all the latest books on finance.
Then MtGox goes down, and it was all for naught. (Or Cryptsy, or Bitfinex, ...)

Did you import or sweep that paper wallet into a modern software wallet first? Are you aware of how UTXOs work, and that you can't ever send "some" coin from an address? You need to always exhaust the entire balance of an address in a transaction by sending the remaining amount to a change address. The change address can be your same address (i.e. sending it back to yourself) but it has to go somewhere. I ask because I am slightly confused and this error can be a common issue when spending from paper wallets (if you don't import the key into a software wallet that handles change addresses for you)

I of course don't actually know, but anecdotally based of weekly meetups in my hometown and some unverifiable theories:  It seems the BCH hard fork and the jump to 3k awakened Bitcoin to a lot of "regular joes" through increased news coverage. I assume at the same time some institutional money might have coincidentally come in. Those things fueled the price to rise, and caused some virtuous (destructive?) cycle. I have been amazed at the grandmas at my meetup who bought in August

Of course "all" of them are not anything.  I use Mycelium which has source code on github, and apks &amp; sigs on their website. So I am pretty comfortable with it

I agree with your first two sentences.  
However, the value of bitcoin could be measured in lambs, chickens, mbps in a VPN. If you take away all the fiat currencies, you could still measure that bitcoin value is increasing (1 BTC used to be an egg, then its a round-trip flight, now it's a new Hyundai) it would just be messier/less precise.

You are right. *I* am not in favor of increasing the block size, but I agree Satoshi was. He was in favor of Bitcoin being a cheap payment option, and wanted Bitcoin to be used for micropayments.     *sigh* Why can't everyone be as objective and unbiased as me?
@_date: 2017-12-15 04:43:47
No, that makes no sense to me.  IMO Don't put more into Bitcoin than the amount you can lose, or live years without. I think bitcoin will either go to $0 or $1mil. In either case you won't be touching that money for the next X years

My interest in bitcoin fueled me to pursue more programming and technical work, so it definitely had an influence.  I think unless you can find a business that involves holding an inventory of bitcoin AND you can not get hacked (no exchange ever), it's better to buy and hold

I would be careful with this too... At least in the case of some of these Bitcoin forks, as some of them are likely scams, and downloading malicious software in the guise of "Bitcoin Diamond Core" is likely the way in which the scam is executed.

PSM's response is correct. Use a strong password to log into the app, and when done using it, log out.
Aside from that, ask for a daily/weekly limit that matches what you are comfortable with. Maybe they will impose a limit for you.
Security is a balance against convenience. Circle could probably do things better, but you have to choose at some point where on the security/convenience scale you want to stand
