It really is interesting to see how rebranding can happen naturally.

My thought process is this. If someone is scared of something generally that means they don't understand it. We need to find a way to present it to them in a way that intrigues them, not hide the information from them under the guise of "It's magic internet money. Trust me, I know it's secure.".

So while I agree with the sentiment of this article, could they look at the current statistics? The Bitcoin network is 300+ PH/s and was barely dented by the XPY goldrush. 
*edit* - fixed TH to PH.

A normal person grasps that the world around them is limited because they can see it. We need people to have the same transparent view of the limitation of the Bitcoin as they have for gold. This will require them to have some understanding of the technology.

For the same reason I tip on reddit. I like providing compensation to the user giving me access to the content, as well as the creators. Without either I wouldn't be able to see it!

Maybe we should stop calling it mining and call it exactly what it is,  Bitcoin Transaction Processing.

Thank you stranger!

With every one of my family and friends distrusting the blockchain driven Bitcoin I had to find another way to explain it. Once I explained how Bitcoins are minted they had a better grasp on *why* the bitcoin is a better thing to put faith in vs the USD.  This is how I've been able to explain it to my peers,  friends,  and family. It's been very successful so far. 
My question to you is why not?
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:03:34
Why do we need to start with Electronic Cash? Why not start out explaining why the technology is *better* to use? 
The base technology here is NOT the value we put into Bitcoin. The technology is that we have a secure transaction system on the internet that happens to share all the same properties we want our Cash to have.

My transaction ended up going through. After working with support we found that I sent .0018 less than they were expecting. They took care of everything for me, I'm very happy with the customer service provided. Long live the Bitcoin.

Well the reason I'm posting here is to hopefully find people to help collaborate on the effort. This seems like the right community to find those kinds of resources.  
@_date: 2014-12-11 21:30:21
Aren't they inherently the same though? If I showed you gold and you had never seen it before you would have no reason to assign it value other than you had never seen it before. And based on that information you think "Well it could be valuable to me because I haven't seen this in the world before". You do some studying and find that yes indeed, gold isn't just lying on the streets and it is a limited resource. Now you assign it value based on whatever the rest of the market values it at because they know that it is a rare resource. 
We need a way to explain this that allows the general public to see it as a rare resource, and just telling people it's a math equation with limits doesn't get this across. While explaining mining may not be the best route, I feel it paints a better picture as to why an end user should assign it value.

It's super cool to see! Though I'm disappointed a little. I sent money for a Gyft Amazon credit over an hour ago and am still waiting on it to confirm.

Thanks for pointing that out. Fixed! love.

Well, some people collect unique information in the physical world. I'm collecting it in the digital.
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:57:54
The setup cost about $2000, I've made back about $800 in BTC so far. I'm not sad about it. I've gotten more fun out of them than I ever got out of the literally thousands I've wasted on BS tech in the past. As far as I'm concerned the big thing here isn't the Bitcoin, it's unique information in a digital medium. Whatever I "lose" on this hobby, some say gambling, is really just the cost of the entertainment and learning for me. 
TL;DR I've never viewed BTC as an actual source of income, budgeted to be able to continue to do my hobby. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 03:49:42
Well I'll help you get there!

But I can cuddle up with my Antminer's for warmth!
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:29:21
Good thing I usually spend the coins I buy with fiat immediately. All my mined coins will stay in their protected wallet and my equipment will keep mining. It's a hobby,  not an investment.

Bitcoin is like building a rocket-ship while still in orbit., similar to the ISS or any other vessel. We think "We can start the Hohmann transfer! Wait, there's an air leak over there. Crap. Guess we have to wait a bit and fix it then see what happens". This just puts another piece on the ship. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:23:27
It's not an RNG though. It's a lottery to be awarded them yes,  but they're still unique information in electronic form. RNG doesn't give me the payoff feeling I get from Mining,  tweaking my Mining equipment,  playing with the miner code,  playing with the blockchain code,  being involved in the community. Some people pay to be members of country clubs,  some pay to trade penny stocks for startups that don't even have office space,  I choose to put my hobby money into bitcoin.

This reads like an article from 1984 claiming the video game market was dead. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:31:48
With ROB and the NES the video game market took OFF. Basically what we need is for some unknown future mass market to adopt BTC now so in 15-20 years all the kids are familiar with it and use it second hand. That's how Bill Gates won the OS war in the 80's and 90's. He gave it away for free to schools and just waited. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:53:05
If I have kids that have kids that is. But really, they'll find Bitcoin just as novelty as we find silver dollars or $2 bills. It's just fun. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:17:15
And I'm just sitting here enjoying the fact that the more of these comments there the more entertainment in the thread. Plus it encourages others to Cavalry post meaningful content.

I use a pool, BAN (bitcoin mining affiliation). I like the owner and how much he works with the community.

Nah. I'm making 1.5BTC/Month and my electric bill is roughly  $160.

I asked my payroll.  Their response was "not yet".  Once my company allows for it I'm pretty sure it'll be interesting to be the first.

1848 is calling. They would like their editorials back. But in all seriousness you're correct. It takes a sharp mind to mine bitcoin profitably. Now it's about buying the best mining hardware (vs best land) to find the unique information. Gold is nothing more than information in reality that we assign value to because it's unique. The Blockchain allows for us to create unique information that can't be altered/controlled by a governing body/central authority. The people who mine now will be well paid if BTC makes it out of the Betamax stage. 
However if the USA released a coin that was backed by Fiat, had a limited number already mined out, and public decentralized transaction network I could see the BTC market crashing.

Screwed up posting from my phone. My reply:

Couldn't you just use NLockTime to send the coin to centralized wallet account or something? That would make sure your estate had access to it if you die, and if you outlive your predictions you just invalidate the transaction. 
@_date: 2012-10-24 07:08:05
I got excited thinking this was gonna be for the US. Now I'm sad.

I give you a penny but I stamped a receipt on it with additional information. Now you own a penny AND the information written on the penny. 
The penny is kept on a wall where you can look at it, but not touch. You have the keys to unlock it and move it around, but it's still on the wall. The penny can move around, but that additional information from when you received the penny stays put. Now the penny doesn't have the message written on it, but the message is still on the wall. 
Now I have 1 million customers! I can divide 1 BTC out to ~~10,000,000~~ 100,000,000 ~~bits~~ satoshi (~~I think~~ thank you Each of those customers can now generate and store data in the blockchain without the developers having to keep a private one of their own. The processing is all done inherently on the public, distributed network.

Significant Integer (SI) units are the farthest out you can go without introducing any margin of error. In the case of Bitcoin, you can round out to the 8th decimal place, or the 8th SI unit. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:19:32
Well if BTC is divisible by 8 SI units isn't that a 1 with 8 zero's? Or have I been out of school for too long? Either way, it's ELI5 language. Thanks for pointing this out.

If there is someone out there willing to put the time and effort in to creating the forms to get it added, I'll trust them. They will have gone through the instances of this symbol in printed text and use the one that occurs most often. Please don't be negative when people are trying to help the community grow.

Keep up the great work! I've been trying to get my friends into BTC by using smaller amounts, hopefully this style of advertising (donations) helps people get comfortable with the digital information :)
