BTC.COM calls this unique payout method as the Full PPS (FPPS).
When the Tx fee% of block reward was 13.7% this Friday, the BTC.COM pool's users' profit was 9.15% more than what they could get from the standard PPS method used by other pools.

Looks great! Looking forward to the premier as well as the great lineup of speakers that you guys have at next month's summit in Beijing.

Its always been at a premium compared to the international price, a major reason for bitcoin's unfamiliarity in India

The Tweet explicitly confirms that those who will have a share of the facility can mine any altcoin with any hardware they prefer in their part of the whole facility. 
@_date: 2016-11-03 07:07:59
Bitmain owns only a minor share of that facility. Majority of it is owned by other miners who can mine bitcoin or any altcoin with any hardware they prefer.
Check [Bitmain's tweet]( confirming this

Kudos Zebpay team! Looking forward to more such good news from you guys!

It could be if it were entirely dedicated to bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2016-11-17 05:33:03
Doesnt matter. Indians still dont buy like other less-populated smaller countries do because price that Indian exchanges offer is ridiculously higher compared to BTC's international price and Indian exchanges dont seeem to want to change that.

Its not powerful like a regular bitcoin miner. It is meant to be like a Bitcoin block lottery with a chance to win every 10 minutes. Whether you win the lottery or not, you can anyway continue to use it as a standard WiFi router.
@_date: 2016-11-03 08:29:05
You mean if the government wanted to mine for itself? Whats stopping the government from doing that now ?

Here's a thread for that discussion, check the AntPool team's comment:

Couldn't agree more. To add to it, I cannot understand the sudden hype about a white paper released by Timo &amp; Sergio (who are also its patent holders) over an year ago.

Hi ttys0dev,
Bitmain's source code is only one project for S9, R4,T9.
So you can download the source code and this source code supports S9, R4 and T9.
Please leave a message at support.bitmain.com if you have any additional concern.

Hi  I understand your reasons to be on one side of the SW v/s BU debate but I don't understand Greg's recent proposal + timing. 
I have known about ASICBOOST since it first emerged (over an year ago) and know for a fact that:
1. It is an engineering optimization to make mining more efficent and Bitcoin more stronger.
2. Bitmain has not been using it.
Someone as technically well-versed as Greg surely knows that its a hoax. I have no doubt that it is part of a smear campaign against Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-04-18 02:42:41
I agree that its not 90% but it **did** account for a majority of the trade during the time this story is from.
@_date: 2017-04-12 12:22:29
Yes, link please. Interesting to learn that Guy Corem built a BTC mining pool for Bitmain.
@_date: 2017-04-12 06:30:03
Spondoolies-Tech (and particularly Spondoolies' CEO) is working for Bitmain? Your witch-hunt keeps getting interesting.
@_date: 2016-09-28 13:56:40
I strongly recommend you to mine some other altcoin with those GPUs and then exchange them with bitcoin on an altcoin exchange. Bitcoin cannot effectively be mined using GPUs anymore (since 2011).
@_date: 2016-09-29 05:49:05
Its short for alternative coin i.e. cryptocurrencies except bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:29:24
And why don't you buy it from Bitmain's official website instead? It will come with Bitmain's warranty and may cost the same if not lesser than that ebay link you mentioned.

Anthony Murgio, of Coin.mx, who was indicted on alleged money laundering charges in July of last year, had sought to dismiss two of the charges against him in part by arguing that bitcoins don't count as "funds" in the context of US law.
This was rejected by the judge Alison Nathan, who wrote in her ruling that:
"Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term. Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment."

Wonders how much money people already lost with that.

ATM there are two server clusters - one for inside the Chinese GFW and one for outside it. The BTC.com is working on more clusters in other locations.
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:23:42
That gives you the chance to win a block reward of 12.5 bitcoins every ten minutes but, considering the current difficulty, that chance is extremely low. Nevertheless, it works as a simple WiFi router so no harm in using it while hoping you win the lottery.
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:26:27
Yes, this is your best option considering your budget and wish to mine ONLY bitcoins. Only buy it from a trusted seller, those miners are out of their 3-month Bitmain warranty by now.
@_date: 2016-09-27 06:55:35
Bitcoin miner+heater. The idea has been around [for over 4 years]( and there seems to have been more than [one company]( trying to develop the idea into reality. Why do you think we haven't seen an effective miner+heater yet ?
Maybe its because nobody wants a noisy space heater and, if one adds thermostat/regulator in such a heater, the mining profitability will suffer. It still doesn't seem enough reason for not having such a heater out there yet. 
Would like to know your views, products that were and your own experiences using a miner for heating.
@_date: 2016-09-28 14:09:50
I wish I could say something encouraging but it would still be far from the truth i.e. even 8 Block Erupters can only give you a hashrate of 2.66 GH/s
If you check a reliable mining profitability calculator, like the one at [BTC.com]( you will realize that you will be spending more to pay for the electricity(~$0.1/kWh) than the bitcoins you will make even in the next 2-3 years. This is assuming your block erupters and USB hub is free-of-cost.
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:35:15
IDK , I have only used Antpool. BTW BTC.com's pool (pool.btc.com) is charging zero fee until 2017, is open-source and has some unique features to make mining there more productive.
@_date: 2016-09-30 03:47:24
Great work! 
Looking forward to widespread use of bitcoin in the country that is the world's largest remittance recipient.
@_date: 2016-09-27 09:58:40
Part of me knew that was coming after I posted the question. Just let it be for you to add some humor :)

The BTC.com pool's website, if accessed from outside China, shows only the traffic on the US node at this moment. If it is accessed from inside China, it shows a more real picture (I am in China, screenshot:  You can try both the sites using a VPN. 
The BTC.com team is working on merging the two hashcharts, should be done soon. You can contact BTC.com's core dev team on Telegram (

Another federal judge says bitcoin IS money....seems they use it when they want to indict someone. 
@_date: 2016-09-28 15:18:58
If you really wanna mine bitcoin with that budget and not any other altcoin (as I would recommend) then I suggest you either buy a used Antminer S7 or, if you are in the US, a new Antminer S7-LN.
@_date: 2016-09-27 05:47:25
The BTC.com team has merged the hashcharts. Now you can see the pool's real hashrate on its homepage even when you access it from outside China
@_date: 2016-09-27 09:52:19
Sorry to hear that. Here's a post on Bitmain's blog to inform about the scam:
@_date: 2016-09-27 09:39:22
Thats the one I linked "one company" to in my comment. Doesn't seem like they are going to release a product anytime soon, assuming they haven't given up the idea yet.
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:52:09


I think you mean a 100% chance of mining a block.
@_date: 2016-10-13 07:24:10
No, they will not be sold to general public.
You will need to be a major buyer and contact sales from their website to find out the price and availability of the chips
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:19:27
Although the mining is negligible too, it does give you a chance to win a 12.5BTC "lottery" while you use it just as you use your WiFi router at home.
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:50:03


Yes, the international shipping and customs are a bummer, specially for a  small product like this. 


So the odds of winning ~8225 USD are 1/56000 ? Sounds good considering all other major single-winner lotteries worldwide.
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:17:36
Its your standard WiFi router with a built-in ASIC chip for bitcoin mining. The power consumption of that chip is negligible AFAIK
@_date: 2016-10-27 03:39:50
The point is not to mine a block but to use it as a WiFi router and stand a chance to win a lottery every ten minutes
@_date: 2016-10-26 10:22:30
Trying to find the power consumption info but, like other WiFi routers, it is unavailable on the webpage. It requires a mere 0.2A input current to give you an idea
@_date: 2017-05-19 03:41:08
Agreed. Most of us get into debates, often heated, with Bitcoiners among the community but that doesn't change the fact that we still enjoy meeting the same people for drinks or chats about various topics because ultimately we are all on the same side in a world controlled by fiat currencies or banks. We should never forget that, this close-knit nature of the community is a major reason I feel happy to be part of this community despite all the mud-slinging within the community.
@_date: 2016-10-26 09:28:54
When you buy a lottery ticket and you dont win it, you lose the price of the ticket. With the AntRouter, there is no loss as long as its working as a WiFi router.
