For reference for every $5 spent was a quarter of a Bitcoin, I think I got a deal for 5 Bitcoins for making 3 orders with 1 guy.

Oh didn't even notice the additional order, it was one order per $5 so if it was billed for like $20 that is 4 orders

V-O-L-U-M-E, the volume has come and gone and now where is it going to come from? The untapped/unbanked in Africa? We have a serious problem by way of volume that only the institutional money can fix.

Not sure how having a lot of assets burdens one with such a responsibility, if you can even call it a responsibility.

Why the fuck are you going to boycott for the purpose of not being able to spend money that isn't yours to begin with?

Apparently you haven't heard of an unauthorized transaction chargeback before.

They look great, well done. Plenty of webmasters out there building out cryptocurrency-related websites and free icons such as these are a major help to them.
