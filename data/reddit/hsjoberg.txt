Amazing BitPay! It only took what? 5 months?
This damn company.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:08:48


I agree, a great CEO understands his customers, meaning he would do what's necessary to have the tx fees as low as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:31:28
Because it is still alpha software and real money is at stake on mainnet.
Testnet is doing much better.
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:34:50
No we're not, no lightning node has entered beta mode yet, they're all officially in alpha stage.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:44:58


This doesn't make any sense. We should be really grateful that people are actually willing to put real money on the line to make the implementations bug free, not shame these people...
 
Also, protocol developers becoming customer-support representative? ...That's not really what I'm seeing in the channels I'm active on, there's a lot of enthusiasm and the people who are knowledgeable, but not necessarily a Lightning dev, are doing the best to help people, regardless of it being mainnet or testnet.


I do what I want, thank you.
The app looks amazing though! Exactly what we need!
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:07:51
The hardfork attacks (XT, Classic, BU, S2X).
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:51:30
Yes, the same as with SegWit.
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:12:14


Yes, that's what they literally had to do. SegWit2x was a hostile hardfork that used the same network magic, the same address format and overall just wanted to make a hostile takeover of the network.  
What the bitcoin developers, _a group of people who mostly aren't hired by any company_, had to do, is to implement mitigations against this hardfork instead of working on improving Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:27:42
Well, Lightning-App is actually running lnd in autopilot-mode, meaning it will automatically connect and open up channels with nodes.  
But yes, I expect the Lightning wallets to be more streamlined, eventually.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:06:44
Using a fullnode is for _yourself_, not the network (albeit it helps SPVs).
Use the fullnode as a wallet and/or connect your mobile wallet to the fullnode.
@_date: 2018-01-15 08:52:04


I wouldn't expect this anytime soon. If ever.
It also doesn't make so much sense, lightning-c, lnd and eclair all work with bitcoind as a backend.  
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:20:51
Only c-lightning can be used for Lightning Charge.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:20:01
On that topic, what happened to the idea that both sides fund a channel at once, as described in the LN whitepaper?
I get that you probably wanted to keep the current BOLT protocol as simple as possible.

I understand that it is still very early, but is the plan to propose signature aggregation just for a single input, or aggregation across all inputs in a transaction?
@_date: 2018-01-09 13:47:45


It is already active.


It will take time before we have any widespread use, unfortunately.

What is Binance?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:31:04
If you have to ask this, my answer would be no.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:09:32
Zap is a Lightning Wallet.
Most of the work that has been done in the past years has been on the actual protocol itself and Lightning nodes.
That's why it's exciting to see good looking graphical lightning wallets. Zap uses lnd (an LN node) as it's backend.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:36:04
Yeah? Just how bad do they need to be to _not_ use the best practices that have been known for months now.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:22:23


Oh yes, people have lost a lot of money using Bitcoin...
Also, I know a very specific group that will do everything in their power to dismiss Lightning, regardless of how good it is.
We should focus on making Lightning better, not the opposite.


Nope. If Lightning is awesome, people will use it.


Lightning is not a "product". This isn't a company.
@_date: 2018-01-14 01:38:35
No, signatures are still malleable, even with the LOW_S enforcement.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:15:29
Not even that, they are basically saying that it's not important.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:20:25
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:37:11
Technically, it can.  
It requires the new type of SPVs called "Neutrino" though, which isn't widely used/supported yet.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:38:41
For normal transactions (emphasis mine):


For pay to script (emphasis mine):


So for a normal transaction, you will see a improvement of 3 bytes.  
For smart contracts/multi-sig you will see cost of 11 additional bytes.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:53:47
No, they weren't. They have always been seen for what they are; hostile attacks that tried to hijack Bitcoin.
There's nothing wrong with doing a good hardfork with strong replay protection. None of the forks that I mentioned had that, as they were trying to be _Bitcoin_.  
They didn't get any widespread consensus, but still continued, hence attack.
@_date: 2018-01-02 23:48:03
Yeah and that (factories) only goes so far as well.
Sidechains... Hmm yes maybe if we can make cross atomic swaps work seamlessly.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:24:46
Because it is specifically built for that backend, there's nothing unusual about that.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:09:08
It's a bit tricky. Between channels and nodes on the network the tx/s metric is pretty much irrelevant, _but_ we cannot scale up indefinitely with just LN because we need space onchain for the commitment transactions etc, that's why we eventually need a blocksize increase as well of some sort.
cc @_date: 2018-01-29 16:30:54


What are you talking about? 
Transactions with 1 satoshi _per byte_ fee are going through.
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:48:27
Yes I'm well aware of the different optimizations available. I think we should implement those first before anything else.
But we should understand that there will come a day when there pretty much isn't any thing more to do.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:24:23


Lightning Network is a P2P-network on top of another P2P-network called Bitcoin.
It's not a centralized company that can make fast decisions.
It will take time.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:08:39
Oh, awesome!!
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:45:20
You are right, cross atomic swaps are not needed, but some nodes will need to act as "exchanges" having both BTC  and coins on the sidechain. 
Saying that it would be the same as increasing mainchain blocksize is dishonest. It's clearly more messy. My take is that it probably won't be practically feasible.
@_date: 2018-01-11 01:00:02
Just a reminder, that estimate is out of date and we can probably do a lot better with new ideas like MAST, Schnorr signatures and multi-party channels.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:20:50
Well, I guess we have some outstanding questions on how the implementation would look like. :)
A pure extension block would mean a separate UTXO set, which could complicate things.  
I'm more fond of doing it onchain (still as a softfork), without an extension block.  
To enter CT-mode, you would still make a commitment, sending the funds to a "miner-controlled" address like you would in a ext block, but after that,  the CT transactions would still take place on mainchain, but the amount field set to 0, and the rangeproof in the scriptSig* or somewhere else.
EDIT: changed from scriptPubKey to scriptSig.
@_date: 2019-07-16 07:58:54
It's not true.
BTCPay was built from scratch, but with a compatible Javascript API with BitPay so that it's easier to migrate from BitPay to BTCPay.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:26:34
WTF, you are linking something that is completely irrelevant.
My point is that, mining is the whole reason why we can transact in Bitcoin without double spending risk in the first place (given enough confirmations).
If the issue of 51% attacks, also known as malicious reorgs, wouldn't exist, we wouldn't need PoW mining.  
Thankfully there's an economic incentive for miners to act honest, and so far the majority of the miners are acting rational by continuing to work on the longest chain.

It is a little bit difficult to explain in short, I think there are some good Youtubers that will do it better for me.
But I like the bar tab analogy;
Suppose you go to a bar to drink beer.  
You might buy 4 of those in different time periods, _but you pay for all 4 beers once_, when you leave the bar. You pick up the tab.  
This essentially how payment channels work, and is what Lighting network is based upon.  
Instead of paying for each single beer, making a transaction that is recorded on the blockchain, you batch these into one transaction, and pay once, in a secure manner.
Lightning network is an network of interconnected payment channels.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:33:46


Bitcoin Core devs have nothing to do with Lightning Network.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:30:42

...  
That's not what I said. There are a lot of numbers between 1MB and 100MB.


Just increasing the blocksize is a terrible way to move forward. It doesn't improve efficiency at all.


LN will take time yes, but you think that we can deploy a hardfork quickly? Get real.

@_date: 2017-12-16 01:20:23

@_date: 2017-12-22 11:04:36
113 MB was with old methods and estimates.
With advancements in efficiency (Multipool, Schnorr sig, CSV), I think it's possible that the blocksize could be even lower.

Edge Android beta is out with SegWit support.
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:52:00
They implemented it because they can force the tx fee to use, probably causing less issues/support tickets.
Unfortunately they're so incompetent that they let CloudFlare DDoS prevention kick in when wallets want to fetch the payment request, causing them to fail because, well, they're not browsers.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:24:11


Yes and no, It is like a prepaid card like suggested, but it is supposed to be used for all small transactions, whether it be for groceries, and online movie or paying your friend. You shouldn't have to touch on-chain for that at all.
In other words, it is supposed to be beneficial to have your money in LN channels. It isn't supposed to be a burden.
@_date: 2018-09-14 13:10:12

This this is nonsense, they have the Segwit BIPs, which is the reference _not_ Bitcoin Core.
And to cross check, that's already possible. Bitcoin Core supports Segwit from day 1.  
0.13.1 and upwards were the clients that deployed Segwit in the first place.  
It is also possible to create Segwit addresses.


Yes, but that's not strictly needed for utilizing Segwit, I'm fine with using P2SH as a stop-gap, bech32 adoption will probably take years.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:11:55
Oh yes I did, but you never know these days. :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:12:08




No. You prove it just like you would prove a non-segwit transaction.


SegWit did a lot more than increasing the blocksize...


As a programmer I can say that you are  exaggerating.
For no good reason? It's a soft fork! And an elegant one.


No it wouldn't, it wouldn't have fixed transaction malleability, quadratic sighash scaling problem and a lot of other things.

Unfortunately not for Bitcoin Cash lol, as they removed SegWit.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:36:57
Yes, but I would say it's highly unlikely.
It's possible that miners are faking and actually not running BIP91 (SegWit signaling enforcement), in that case a temporary chain split may happen.
If more than 50% are faking, a non-segwit enforcing chain will emerge.  
This will cause a mess though as UASF nodes are currently online and operating, and so a permanent chain split might happen.

If there's a new whole-block signature that needs to be verified, it couldn't already be cached as signatures are per tx-basis before a block is generated, so that means performance could take a hit as caching doesn't really work anymore.
In other words verifying signature per tx is still needed, on top of per block.

How about you actually read on about how Lightning works?
* A mobile wallet could be push only which doesn't require monitoring
* Mobile wallets could take use of a watch tower and yes, it already exists, see Lightning wallet, 
* You don't need to be online 24/7, it depends on what timemout time is set. c-lightning and lnd has 144 blocks timeout, in other words once per day.

@_date: 2017-11-16 10:17:56
Thank you for your answers.




Right, so you mean that when you want to enter CT-mode, you would send to your receiver (amount being 0, but with a rangeproof commitment), and also to a "CT pool address" controlled by miners.
That way, when someone would like to go clear to a non-CT output, miners would be able to pull funds from the CT pool.
Pretty neat solution.


Why is there no urgency here? Although I understand that CT and the new breakthroughs are still pretty immature, CT is almost feasible for mainnet now, performance-wise.  
Do you mean that there's no urgency here because you're confident a good softfork solution would possible?

You *can* just automate it over the wire (the sender provides and embeds R in the onion and just asks the receiver to accept an incoming transaction), it's just that it hasn't been developed yet (except from lnd's current test).
So it is possible to implement "send to lightning pubkey".
A thing that makes this very exciting is that it will be possible to develop a blockchain resolver for easily readable usernames (" without the privacy issues that we've previously had (when you linked to a bitcoin address).
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:26:22


Right!  
I've been researching a similar approach to make Bitcoin more divisible.
Would the 0 output approach for CT mean that you would never be able to get back to a non-CT output (that would break it for old nodes AFAICT)?

There are definitely hubs and I don't think you do anyone a service denying that.  
Some like for example LN-BIG have their sole mission to be hubs.
Acknowledging that some LN nodes will have higher presence isn't something that needs to be bad. The reason why Lightning is more effective than on-chain is because it is more centralized (you have 3-4 hops compared to the whole network knowing your transaction).

I don't think you understand what "working" means. Working does not mean that everyone has to be using something, and by your standards BAT is not working either.






Okay I get it, you simply cannot read very well.  
I didn't say that BTC does anything better than Ehereum/BAT, I said that both scale badly.
@_date: 2019-04-26 15:34:40
Wasn't the reason they moved to ERC20 that Bitcoin was deemed too "slow"? That's at least what you wrote.
Fundamentally, there is no real difference between how the Bitcoin and the Ethereum blockchain is built. They both scale very badly and at least right now they both desperately need layer 2 solutions. Ethereum devs have a lot of ideas, like sharding etc, but I think they're all just wishful thinking if you want to have a solid decentralized and secure blockchain. Bitcoin Core devs have a more conservative scaling approach (Schnorr sigs seems to be the next move).
The only real innovation in blockchain technology that I see is MimbleWimble, but the trade-offs are perhaps too bad and I of course don't blame Brave for not going that route (No MW coin existed when BAT launched).
If Brave would've made some kind of payment channel contract on top of Ethereum (or trying out Raiden), I wouldn't have so much problem with it, but just moving to an ERC20-token is just an easy non-scalable cash grab.

It's not. If BAT wants to make a non-valuable collectible item, I guess they could make their own isolated token, but I don't think that's what they're after as they're targeting real industries. They surely want BAT to have a value?


Look, if it is only used in closed loop as a collectible, it's has no utility, it's just a simple collectible.  
The concept of utility coins are flawed, because there is no reason to move from sound money to a specialized coin that only does one single purpose. You lose all network effect and the sound money could've been used in the first place.

@_date: 2018-03-07 23:04:31


Well, it helps in two ways.  
First off, using Segwit helps you, because Segwit transactions are discounted. This means that your transaction will require a lower fee should it be Segwit instead of legacy.
The way the discount works is that signature data counts towards 0.25 bytes for every byte.
This means that if many would use Segwit, the block could fill up with more transactions and thus everyone would benefit from it, _even those not using Segwit_.


Well it is a _wallet_, not cold storage, and so the ability to do payments should be top priority.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 10:45:11

It wasn't a tiny fee reduction by the time an upgrade was actually needed.
I'm sure you understand the difference between now and a year ago, but it seems that your argument is still the same for some weird reason.
Look, the reason people wanted SegWit to Mycelium was to reduce the fees *for their transactions.* It had nothing to do with Lightning Network. But considering you didn't understood this and still don't, it's no wonder that it took this long for SegWit to get implemented.

Yes, but it is absolutely necessary for _miners_ as they would otherwise risk losing mined blocks, should they not conform with the new ruleset.


In the case of a softforks they would validate all new script enhancements as true, regardless if they are being correctly spent or not.  
In a softfork, old nodes and miners would recognize transactions containing the new enhancements as "non standard" and so they wouldn't try to mine them themselves.
The assumtion is basically that at least &gt;50% of the miners when a softfork happens would conform with the new ruleset, otherwise we could end up seeing a bad chainsplit.

Neutrino is a new privacy enhancing lite client mode ("SPV").  
It is to be used with Lightning network wallets.
The old SPV mode can expose your address to random peers pretty trivially. In Neutrino SPV, you keep track of transaction IDs in blocks instead instead of asking other nodes to give you information about your addresses.
Should a block contain information that you need, you actually download the block.


No it is a network feature, not a softfork.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:05:10
Yep you still have an elitist attitude, sorry.
Suggesting that all Bitcoin users need to be tech savvy is ridiculous, especially since being tech savvy (to the point of compiling binaries which was the original topic) is a specialization on its own today.


Then why are you suggesting that Bitcoin is in "beta"?  
You can't have it both ways.
You can claim that Bitcoin is highly experimental and people should use it with caution, but there's no point in suggesting that people shouldn't use it because it's in beta (which it isn't).

Well yes, you could argue that Satoshi's first client is a reference client, as there were no documentation of the network.


Well most new P2P protocol and  consensus changes have a BIP assigned.
For example roasbeef's inverse bloom filter proposal (P2P-layer) first landed in btcd, not Bitcoin Core. It has a BIP.
Nowadays there are information and documentation out there on how to make a compatible node, but as Bitcoin Core is the de-facto backbone in the network, one should obviously test it against Bitcoin Core.

It's a LN term.

I'm afraid you are mistaken.  
Softforks as an upgrading mechanism does not require a miner to mine blocks with new features, but they absolutely need to conform and verify other miners mining blocks with them.
In other words, a softfork requires all miners to conform with the new amended ruleset. SegWit does not change this.

I love Rust, but no, that doesn't sound like a very bright idea.
Bitcoin Core is a C++ and Qt project, and should stay so because of the larger number of programmers familiar with these things.

@_date: 2018-07-07 00:34:31
To get anywhere near 25% reduction, we need signature aggregation across all inputs in a transaction, which your links are talking about.
The current proposal by Wuille does not outline anything about per transaction signature aggregation.
This is not true:

I don't think they understand that stealing from a Segwit output would be a hardfork in the eyes of the network (assuming large network penetration, like SegWit has today).
But I am not actually very surprised, I estimate around ~1% of all actually run a full node.


What I don't understand is why they take the witness separation so literally. It's still a part of a transaction.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:29:52
Are Samsung, Toshiba, Nakamichi and Motorola all linked?
@_date: 2017-07-17 14:49:48


This is true for all softforks really, and AFAICT it was the reason why BIP9 has a 95% threshold.
It's a good point though.


We chose to include it because it has at least gotten some traction from some Bitcoin miners/pools, but I do agree it will probably fail like all other attempts.

As Moore's law has to do with the number of transistors that can be put on a given space, it is definitely applicable to SD cards/NAND flash memory.

Why? Sidechains still need validation, and if it's a popular sidechain, all miners will be _forced_ to mine on it because of the revenue.   
@_date: 2019-05-08 15:17:51


To add on to that:
Rendezvous routing is very similar to Tor hidden services -- the sender and receiver in lighting does not know the identity of each other, but they still transact, because the receiver picked an independent node ("rendesvouz point") in the network *from which an onion routed circuit to the receiver is constructed*.
The sender would know the path to the rendezvous point but not anything further, hiding the identity of the receiver.
I find this very exciting about this because it makes Lightning even more private by hiding both the sender identity as well as the receiver entity.  
This could also potentially open up to a better version of Tor (albeit a slowass variant).


No... Sphinx is the name of the onion routing protocol being used on the Lightning Network.  
I think Christian Decker prefers the name "Spontanteous payments". Calling it Sphinx is just plain wrong and is confusing.
@_date: 2019-05-05 23:08:44
Spontaneous payments are set for BOLT 1.1.
@_date: 2019-05-06 23:05:38


It's not completely true as nodes publicly announce their Lightning channels to the Lightning network today. So your output is known.
You can have private channels though.

Again, I don't think you know very much about Jordan or his audience/demographics. This isn't true and it is a common meme being spread by mainstream media. Just check out any interview and this topic will be talked about.

Bitcoin Core and other competent projects should have handle and improve the fullnode software.  
As for (soft)forks, this should be up to the community and/or fullnode operators.
What exactly do you mean with "control"?

Looks cool!
How do you handle a subscription? As that is not a feature of neither Bitcoin nor Lightning.

Batching has always been possible. It has nothing to do with SegWit.

The well being and wealth of the western world hardly justifies workers parties anymore. That's why worker parties are losing ground in the west.
But that doesn't mean that the left has disappeared, it has merely changed shape to a "cultural marxist" one, meaning that the focus is injustice in other parts than pure wealth. You must be completely delusional if you do not see this.
In case you haven't noticed, the right doesn't really exist anymore either as they have given up and accepted the welfare system, often via the "Third Way".

This is the correct answer. You can see the output being 0.1, so he obviously tried to send a little bit first to test, but got completely rekt.

His messages are pretty non-controversial for normal people.  
The media has been attacking and slandering Peterson nonstop since his rise to fame, because he dared to criticize political correctness (Bill C-16).  
Seeing Bitcoiners side with the extreme left and marxists is pretty sad.

The sentence after you said this: "Do you agree with that as well?", how should we interpret this other than that you're implying that Peterson believe in this idea?


Yes and what makes you think this isn't a reasonable statement, have you seen the situation middle east and how they operate? (sigh... just to be clear, I'm not endorsing this)
EDIT: By the way the left in the west, that you're virtue signaling so hard for, already thinks it's necessary to intervene considering all the consent laws we've seen recently.

At first I was very excited about this, but then I saw the setup of the system. Sorry but it is utterly terrible.
@_date: 2018-12-31 10:15:51
Yes, the invoice schema could be improved to handle this.  
The issue is that the receiver needs to expose a new H(R) for every single payment, so we must have some way where the sender can get new secrets iteratively.
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:57:38
Gotcha, yes that probably works for now.
I've been thinking about how to solve this, and to follow the Bitcoin ethos, the wallet itself should be able to trigger transaction with or without the user's consent. This is in contrast to Visa/MasterCard that just takes the money.  
With normal Bitcoin addresses this is pretty easy, just a new parameter (`recurring`) to the Bitcoin URI is needed.  
For Lightning, this faces a problem, as it requires a fresh payment request for every payment.  
I've yet to see an elegant solution for this. It could be possible to solve this by just asking for a payment request over the wire/onion. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:22:06

Hi, thanks for being open to feedback.
I've no problem with bluewallet acting as a hub, but requiring users to send funds to an address under your control instead of directly to a channel seems really backwards and uneccessary.
You could do it like Eclair is doing, with having the wallet open a channel to lndhub/bluewallet and then from there to the outer network. Mobile wallets still don't need a watch tower in that scenario, although in both solutions they're putting some trust in bluewallet.
I am guessing you are doing what you're doing now because you don't really need a full fledged lightning node for the wallet then, but nonetheless I don't think it weights up for the downsides of this solution.
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:47:14
