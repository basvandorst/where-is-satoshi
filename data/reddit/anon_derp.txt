I mean, I see what you're saying, but not exactly. Politics are just actions and opinions as to what should've done concerning government. So even if you're the most cryptolibertarian anarchist ever, that's still a political view, regardless of it having no government. I think what you meant, though, was that pursues government solutions to government problems. I disagree with this-- most of what is on that sub is about how less government and the absence of government interference in our lives and in the market would solve problems.

Because a plurality, if not a majority of the Bitcoin community is some form of libertarian. Look at this sub's sidebar: Libertarian, Anarcho-Capitalism, Austrian Economics, Cryptoanarchy, Agorism, etc. Bitcoin is the free-market solution to the problem government currency and market intervention.

I feel like this is just a very blatant advertisement.
