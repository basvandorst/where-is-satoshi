And if newspapers can do it... so can banks! Crypto is powerful but so are they, we have a fight on our hands!

Refusal to learn and jumping to conclusions is why it may appear that way for some.

This is actually a really good idea. With BitShares you have an entire financial platform where you can set up multiple accounts, send/ receive, trade, you can setup recurring payments (soon to be added to gui), you can manage various accounts with varying levels of permissions and multi sig. There is also a company called PalmPay which allows merchants to accept crypto as payment method via mobile apps. Another company called Quintric which is a coin backed by gold coins which could be used to store value. Plus the obvious access to many other crypto coins. It really could be the full economic package if setup and used properly.
