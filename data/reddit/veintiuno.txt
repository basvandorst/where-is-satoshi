Trying to helpful and friendly here, so don't take this the wrong way.  I don't think that conference announcement speaks for Satoshi - seems like part of the point is to discuss Satoshi's written works and what he might have been thinking at the time and whether its relevant today vis-a-vis various technologies.  What part speaks for Satoshi?  Also, tbf, I think your concern cuts both ways - being up in arms over title of a conference speaks for Satoshi and its also a little paternalistic.  Finally, your concern may have some merit - I've read academic papers on this subject.  Why not attend and raise the issue professionally in a paper instead of accusing those folks of fraud?  
@_date: 2016-08-31 18:56:01
Not sure I understand the tone here.  What's wrong w/ folks organizing a conference to discuss various technologies that may or may not be in line w/ some historical writings about bitcoin?  Seems like this happens all the time in other fields.  Example:        
Why not apply to attend and offer to critique some of the technologies?  Your insights would valuable and critiques seem welcome based on the write-up.

I'm extremely chill atm.  TBH, I'm more concerned about Cobra than anything - nobody has verified his concerns or that his account wasn't compromised. How do we do that?     
Also, if Bitcoin.org is potentially the target of a state-sponsored attack, why should we still use the site? I can't help but think the Cobra account and bitcoin.org are now burned - hopefully things turn around and clarity is obtained because bitcoin.org is/was a good site. Genuinely concerned here.

@_date: 2016-08-31 19:40:07
Sorry to be dense, but I'm not sure I follow you here.  What's fraudulent about the conference name? I don't think anyone is misrepresenting who is behind the conference or anything.  Attributing fraud over the use of a name for a conference where the founder's public writings will be discussed seems a little irresponsible if not defamatory ("fraud" is a legal conclusion after all) - consider editing your post and using a different word to capture the dissatisfaction.      
Not sure what's up with the hostility either - I though you liked research and science. 
@_date: 2016-08-31 20:29:42
lol. you're funny. fraud, in a non-legal sense, literally does not mean that.  it means something more like 'misrepresentation' or faker - go ahead and post a link to a definition. a pepsi-challenge if you will.  the op says that the conference will feature a panel on discussing Satoshi's written work.  this whole line of objection regarding the use of Satoshi's name is silly and a waste of time - are we going to change the name of .00000001 to something else other than 1 satoshi now?  what's the real problem?  competition or something?  seems like folks should want to go and discuss ideas and technologies on the merits instead of name calling.  i always thought you were one of the professionals in this space; sadly your recent posting history suggests otherwise. 
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:22:37
Good question.     
Seems to raise questions about the security of bitcoin.org in general.     
QUESTION - Lets assume Cobra was hacked - how does he prove he's got things under control at this point?  Also, is there a defense against this type of hacking situation (like revoking website editing rights or something)?  What would/should be the best practice here?

Respectfully, I see it as the opposite - bitcoin is politics in action (i.e., 'in crypto we trust, in govt we verify').  The political and user goals should be determined first, then the path there gets coded.  Decentralization is hugely political.  See here:

@_date: 2015-12-17 22:17:22
I don't disagree too much - I think the "by who" question is also political. The ideas can definitely be forked and re-appropriated - this is politics too.  More concretely, determining what bitcoin is or the parameters for what it can become is necessarily exclusionary as to certain categories of people and uses.  That's an exercise of power - by someone.

It seems like there could be some sort of targeted ratio (or range of ratios) between number of transactions:nodes that could adjust the tx fee accordingly.  In other words, maintaining the ratio would be how the network is secured.  I'm not at all a math or coder person, genuinely curious.  In any case, these seem like fair points.           
IDEA: In corporate takeover attempts, sometimes a poison pill is triggered to dilute an attacker's shares/targeted ownership position.*  Is there some way to do this with nodes?  If security hits X point (maybe below a ratio like I mentioned before), then magic internet money god generates more nodes (maybe subsidized by tx fees (the tax in Lee's analogy))?            
*        
If the poison pill analogy doesn't suit you, what about a self-replicating robot?  Turn the network into a self-replicating robot to always maintain a certain node threshold. Could use 21.co-style machine to machine transactions for auto-purchasing new nodes.

Meh, as much as I wonder about stuff like this, cutting off Blockstream seems drastic.  They have some fair points (e.g., disclosure of testing info).  A better call to action, IMHO, would be a request for the Devs and others to get consensus on a conflict of interest policy.  For example, here's a sample policy that I'm not sure whether I totally support yet: conflicts should not be banned, but they should be disclosed early and often, and the devs w/ such conflicts should remove/recuse themselves from the consensus tally RE: accepting changes to the protocol.

Good rationale, and thanks for putting together a concrete plan for btc users out there (and thanks for the way you made the argument in favor of your proposal - the standards you employed to set-up the plan helped a lot).            
QUESTION - I think the argument that 'empirically, unfilled blocks work, but exceeding block space w/ a backlog of tx is not tested over the long-term' is quite compelling due to its simplicity and intuitiveness; has this argument been made before now?  I ask because I don't recall seeing it before yesterday on the ML and I'm trying to understand if this is one of those solutions sitting right in front of our faces  that has been overlooked (for whatever reason, no judgment from me if that's the case).      
In any case, thanks again.  I look forward to reading your responses to various comments people are making.

Just because one is a core dev doesn't mean that person is beyond bone-headed or pig-headed reasoning. Assuming otherwise appears to be a major fallacy w/ some of the core dev arguments: we're experts and/or have devoted more time to dev-work recently, so we're more correct. Unfortunately, expertise in cryptography  or contributed time/resources doesn't make the contributor beyond making mistakes in their work and it doesn't mean the developer has expertise in economics, monetary policy, conflict resolution, communication (including inter-cultural communication), politics/government, law and so forth.  Devs on this project should dev what the majority want even if they fall in the minority or work on something else.

Ripple will be O.K. - crypto-currency has come a long way since 2013 and so have the companies operating in the space.  However, I'm not so sure about the less-professional altcoin teams who don't have the resources to research and implement compliance obligations.  To me, this action is a warning shot to those folks selling coins/ tokens/etc. through ICOs who have not secured MSB registrations (FinCEN seems to treat these initial coin transactions as money transmissions, see III.A (page 4) here:          
EDIT1 - Didn't realize a similar comment had been made already when I posted.       
EDIT2 - Its interesting that FinCEN is looking back in time so far (Sept 2013).  I suppose no altcoin dev team that had an ICO in the last few years is safe from a similar action against them by FinCEN.

See also [here](   (note the date and context) and [here] ( (note date, note listserve and context; hint: Nov 2008, Satoshi was getting lots of politics questions on the Crypto listserv and the mod wanted to shut it down, Zooko offers to host the discussion on the P2P hackers site).

Yeah, the statement is short-sighted (good catch on spelling).  I am not outraged or anything - I thought my tone was kept well in check and avoided any kind of personal attack.  I do perceive your post as questioning motives.  You may raise a fair point, but it is also fair to scrutinize, contextualize, and criticize the point.  No biggie.       
I also think knowing information about who your target is might help to think about why listening closely to what Zooko is saying is important.  At the very least, he has a perspective that is extremely useful since it goes back to DigiCash and was obviously valuable to Satoshi.  It could also be that Satoshi is speaking . . . which is interesting.

The proof is that Blockstream does not submit code or control what gets merged.  There's not even a Blockstream github account or anything like that AFAIK. So, technically, I think you're just wrong - Blockstream as an entity does not control Core (no offense).  Secondly,  Blockstream allowing several/most/all (whatever number that is, its not big - they're a start-up) of its employees to contribute work time to Core - or even requiring it - is fair game IMHO (I may not like it, but its fair).  IMB or any other company or group can bring in 100 devs tomorrow in this open source envt and the issue as to Blockstream's control via numbers vanishes. In other words, they're not blocking people or companies from contributing to Core, they're not taking anyone's place at the dinner table.

"So the company that **is flagrantly violating** FINCEN regulations and taking a devmine/premine from their Blockchain.... right."      
Which FinCEN regs - there are a lot?  How do they violate them? Whether there are violations or not, you are making strong legal conclusions and doing so with a statement about intent ("flagrantly"). You are concluding illegality even though you are not in a position to actually make such a conclusion and haven't presented any detailed or rational arguments in support of your assessment.  In a lot of jurisdictions, knowingly making unsupported negative statements about person that can damage their reputation is considered defamation (regardless of actual damages).  Imputing a crime in the defamation can supercharge said claim and may take out some affirmative defenses a defendant may ordinarily have.   But I guess if you're just operating as a nameless cartoon character, it is ok . . .  Sorta classless, man - I expected more from you.

Who is making the comparison and who is comparing a business to Satoshi?  I think you're just asserting the comparison and any reference to a business as a strawman - my point is only that Zooko, and he alone, is qualified and may have some wisdom to share based on on his past experience.  I don't see how current projects/experiments he works on - however flawed you think they may be - change that. 
@_date: 2016-03-30 22:50:30

Yeah, I'm familiar with the regs, but that's not a reg - that's a guidance paper.  Also, let me get this straight, the company just has a plan at the moment and no sale of a convertible virtual currency for real currency has actually happened yet? And, they've some how committed a crime?  Are you assuming they have no competent legal counsel and have published every detail related to their fundraising plan?

Right, its sounds like she's accused of a weapons prohibition violation - although it stands to reason such a violation is not why a bunch of cops showed up early in the AM. It also seems like both Facciola and Maloney were likely to miss xmas with their family anyway given that the cops (18 or more*) showed up at 6am and were authorized to make a forced-entry -  i.e., its reasonable to think the original plan was take them into custody. Additionally, if one with young children is subject to a 10 year weapons ban, why on god's green earth would you risk getting caught with weapons (or with/doing anything else illegal or otherwise prohibited) and therefore risk being forcibly separated from your kids for any amount of time?  Having said that, its reasonable to keep an open mind with this story for the time being.

That's non-responsive.  I said "this way" meaning that I was giving you the benefit of the doubt that you thought this from the beginning.  My point was that anybody that can read knew the miners you met with thought differently as well as some non-miners present (i.e., segwit + 2MB HF).  You need to apologize publicly and profusely for the monumentally poor (firing-level bad) communication if you genuinely thought all this was clear from the beginning - it wasn't (see how i'm still giving you the benefit of the doubt, which is actually worse for you - it means you intended to manipulate people).  
@_date: 2017-01-24 19:13:36
What does "wholly familiar" mean? I already said there was merit in your argument, but that I don't think you've proven your case beyond a reasonable doubt. "Beyond a reasonable doubt" means no reasonable person would disagree with your conclusion following from the evidence.  Your evidence has to be so good it undercuts all the other Satoshi theories and related evidence.  Evidence is not an inference or an argument - its something verifiable from which an argument or inference could be made.  Evidence can be direct (which is rare, ex: a confession, etc.) or circumstantial (most evidence is circumstantial b/c it involves an inference RE: the conclusion - ex: on X date, receipts show Bob bought a gun).  I don't think your evidence is so good that you've proven your point beyond a reasonable doubt because reasonable people can still believe Chaum, Dave Birch, NSA, Finney, PTodd, Maxwell, and/or Theymos, etc. created bitcoin (for example) - but I do think your argument is rational and interesting. I think you should keep writing, etc. - its good stuff to think about.

Ah, ok, I've read arguments like this from you before. I certainly think there's a case to be made about Nash, but I don't think there is proof that rises to the "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard that Nash created Bitcoin. Likewise, and also borrowing some other legal standards about proof, I don't think there's much - if any - solid evidence based upon "preponderance" or a "clear and convincing" standards either. Again, that's not to say you don't have a legitimate or interesting argument that's true - its just that the known evidence prolly isn't good enough to meet the standard you offered (or even some other legal standards used to evaluate the strength of an argument).

"[A]ny" is pretty strong, especially if you don't know the length of my short-list.  I'm pretty sure I've done lots of digging and hunting for Satoshi over the years (including reading the original code) - probably way more than the vast majority of folks. Likewise, I believe I have a pretty good handle on the best arguments for against various Satoshi candidates (some are better than others). 
@_date: 2016-12-20 19:29:02

@_date: 2016-12-09 03:27:04
Sure. TBH, I'm not sure whether you're being sarcastic or not.  There are several folks for whom persuasive arguments could be made that they are Satoshi. Dorian and Craig and ... Theymos and others definitely fall in that category. Doesn't mean anyone of those folks is good or bad person (its possible Satoshi is evil, or a girl, or a government agency, etc).  Who knows, though?  Its just fun to bat around sorta like discussing whether the Chicago Bulls from 1990s could have taken down the San Antonio Spurs of the last decade.

@_date: 2016-11-24 16:29:08
Everything Satoshi may have considered is probably not evidenced from writings alone (his writings are just a small window into what he was thinking).  Having said that, IIRC, there are a few posts of his where he seems to be aware that making changes in the future could be very difficult and subject to factions/politics.        
FWIW, I think the US constitution would be almost impossible to amend at this point in history, even though some amendments might be very useful today.  I'm not sure founders of the country could have predicted how America has developed and become so diverse in people, experiences, and needs; but, I don't think that makes them short-sighted or anything.

With all due respect, everyone was not happy - modern money was invented to solve expensive inefficiency associated with this primitive-style barter system you describe. Szabo wrote a pretty influential paper on this issue here:          
        
    
"Primitive money was not modern money as we know it. It took on some of the function modern money now performs, but its form was that of heirlooms, jewelry, and other collectibles. The use of these is so ancient that the desires to explore, collect, make, display, appraise, carefully store, and trade collectibles are human universals -- to some extent instincts. This constellation of human desires might be called the collecting instinct. Searching for the raw materials, such as shells and teeth, and manufacturing of collectibles took up a considerable portion of many ancient humans' time, just as many modern humans expend substantial resources on these activities as hobbies. The results for our ancient forebears were the first secure forms of embodied value very different from concrete utility -- and the forerunner of today's money."

Interesting point to think about. Quick follow-up question: isn't it possible to build a centralized system on top of a decentralized system (i.e., an alt-currency or instrument, including their respective ecosystems, via a sidechain or other btc derivative)?

One thing to keep in mind is that a drone to be used for deliveries will need to go from the distribution center to the delivery location on its own (or using multiple drones:   A device that requires a pilot close by probably is inefficient in that the costs of that arrangement (licensed pilot, drone, whatever cannabis licenses are required for employee-pilots, insurance (which I'm not sure you could get right now) in case damage is caused to a third party, landing site, or drone itself), maintenance, etc. would far, far, far exceed the cost of just having a person make the delivery.      
      
Drone delivery also adds an element of risk/insecurity  to the business venture because there are too many unknown factors that can interrupt delivery and that can't be controlled (i.e., people shooting down/intercepting the drone; theft of deliverable; hijacked/hacked drone; drawing attention of law enforcement ( in that regard, the current PR campaign is monumentally terrible - if there were ever way to draw the attention of federal law enforcement looking for an easy victory, this is it - one wouldn't be crazy to assume that all people involved, including possibly investors, are being monitored as a result)).       
           
Also, most cannabis laws have strict chain-of-possession requirements (seed to sale laws, which include security cameras focused on POS) as well as transportation requirements - this makes delivery of any kind really difficult on its own (i.e., you can't farm out delivery by using an unlicensed party - anybody that will touch the stuff has be in the state's cannabis database).  Throw in a drone element and all the associated compliance and regulatory concerns, and I don't think you're left with an environment that makes a ton of business sense (or cents) right now.

@_date: 2015-08-05 00:50:02
Yes.  A Ponzi is a type of a scam or fraud and therefore "Ponzi" is a synonym for a scam or fraud by virtue of being a subset of the same.  You meant the converse: scams and frauds are not synonymous w/ Ponzis (b/c there are other scams and frauds besides Ponzis).  Lesson: Think first; troll second. :P   
In any case, my original point was that MK appears to have been authorizing payments/withdrawals from the new money coming in (other peoples' money) and not funds that should have been on deposit for those requesting a w/d.  If not a ponzi per se, it seems pretty close.

in my state, drone operators must have pilot licenses that are subject to FAA oversight.  i bet that law, if its not a federal law itself, or a similar law, applies to and/or exists in a lot of other states.  assuming that the law in my state is the same or similar to the law in california, I don't see a world where a federal agency will allow pilots to use their licenses to violate federal drug laws for very long.

I don't think Greek XBT activities do or will impact price per se (not at least in the short-run), but I do think the drop is likely related to the news about Greece in the same way that other financial markets respond to this type of news (this type of news being globally relevant).  For me, the take away is that the fact that there is a relationship between XBT price and global economic news like with Greece - even if inverse - is a sign that that XBT has arrived.

Chomsky might call mod-censorship like this the "agenda setting function" of the mods.  Basically, though, its the agenda setting function of some glorified domain-squatter-type-folks.      
        
     
Anyway, draw some attention to this problem via media/leverage other channels (bigger players are more active on Twitter, IMHO). Same thing happened in doge-land last year when the mods, many of whom were in bed w/ moolah in some form or fashion, deleted posts, allowed downvote brigades, threats, etc.  It took $1.4M in btc etc. disappearing before both sides of the issue could be posted in that sub-reddit.

I think you're shifting the issue here.  I agree with you that barriers to entry are bad, but I also think that given that the bit-law mandates a license, the app fee for said license is reasonable in light of what goes into evaluating an application and in comparison with similar fees in other regulated industries.  But, lets say you're not shifting the issue and are talking about the fee specifically - who should pay costs associated with evaluating a bitlicense application?  Certainly you don't think the taxpayers of NY, who are most likely ignorant about bitcoin or are otherwise not interested in participating in the BTC economy right, should pay.  That would be very socialism, much unfair.

To piggyback on your comment, estate taxes vary by country and state.  In the US, the federal estate tax is pretty friendly in that a single person can leave more than $5M tax free at death (double that if you're married and structured appropriately).  States can have their own estate tax on top of the federal estate tax.  Lastly, at least at the federal level, there is a gift tax which is linked to the estate tax in the form of a credit.  Basically, you can only give 5M during life or after death tax free.  There are various thresholds you have to pass to trigger gift tax issues (exceeding the annual exclusion, for example), but you can research those on your own.

When I buy BTC from Circle and Coinbase, I can learn about the various employees and their backgrounds (where they went to school, what they were doing before Coinbase and Circle, etc. - other companies have this info too (Bitpay, GoCoin, Ripple Labs, etc.)) - information that, at least for me, puts my mind at ease about my transactions with those services.   Can you share that type of information about yourselves here or on your website? Thanks in advance, and good luck with your enterprise.

I think the purpose is for time associated with due diligence, which is a process that is certainly more than seeing if folks are serious - it also has to do with whether people are qualified to participate in the industry and aware of the various legal requirements.  I haven't read all of the bitlicense, but I believe there are various programs an applicant must implement to start doing business in NY - this seems standard in any industry (liquor board ID/serving training, to use a different industry as an example).  Someone might be very serious with their application, but not qualified.  Not being qualified is not necessarily obvious from reading the application either. Continuing with this point and example, the only way to get to that qualified or not qualified conclusion, is for the licensing agency to investigate and verify facts stated in the application package.  For example, maybe one of these licenses can't be granted to convicted felon (assume financial crimes) or a company that a convicted felon has an interest in.  Not every felon is going to disclose that they're a convicted felon on their application.  Somebody has to verify the credential.  $5K from all applicants spreads the resources around to cover some, but maybe not all, the due diligence required by a licensing office for a given time frame.  Not sure if my point is clear here.      
TLDR, somebody has to pay for the time and resources the licensing agency will spend on applications - the money has to come from somewhere and probably has to come from applicants (the bulk anyway) and not the agency's annual budget.

I think we DO want a hard hitting debate.  I want to see the best arguments from the most vested parties clash so I can evaluate the merits of the various arguments. Sometimes, when you're vested in some work, you can get a little emotional or snarky - so minor mud slinging, posturing and dick-measuring is ok I guess.  I hope people would shake hands at the end of the debate and understand that clash and conflict are of the process (and maybe they do, I have no way of knowing).  Also, if applicable, I would hope that people would disclose whether they have financial interest in any particular position they're advocating so as to ensure bias doesn't creep in too much (I don't think its wrong to have a conflict - I just think it has to be disclosed and scrutinized occasionally).  
@_date: 2015-07-14 21:56:15
Food for thought: $5K isn't that bad.  In my state (not NY), that's equal to the app. fee  for a liquor license (and it doesn't include the background check on management fee, mandatory testing, annual re-licensure, or the county and municipality fees). I believe dispensary licensing results in application charges around that amount as well.  So, while $5K is a lot of money for some folks, for a compliance/regulatory application fee, it may be about right when viewed in its totality and when viewed in relation to app fees across industries. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 02:09:27
Yes and No. Probably additional costs associated with compliance, including attorney and other professional fees (see 's comment), as well as the costs to society for loss of/delay in innovation, continued BS w/ traditional banking (costs, lost time in transferring money, barriers to getting a bank account (e.g., meeting address verification requirements for opening an account; I bet lots of undocumented workers and people who were brought to the US illegally by their parents can't set up a bank account)), etc.

"Strange, interesting, and wildly ambitious things are afoot in the world of Bitcoin and blockchains. I give you Zerocash, a completely anonymous currency; Ethereum, a blockchain platform designed to decentralize much of the Internet; and sidechains, a proposal to accelerate the evolution of Bitcoin itself. Any one of these could conceivably become a very big deal. All three? Prick up your ears."
MY VIEW: Just a bunch of fascinating u-topias (the original the Greek etymology is U-TOPOS, that is, IN NO PLACE) . 
THE PROBLEM: The present cryptocurrencies provide an unacceptable transactional anonymity level and therefore they are the currencies of choice of criminals. You compute, you create something which is called money, such money is accepted by somebody and you get something, nearly anything in return. Peer to peer translations, no clearing houses, no overall Government supervision. It won’ work.

Bitcoin 2.0: Sidechains And Ethereum And Zerocash, Oh My! Posted Oct 25, 2014 by Jon Evans ( Columnist
Strange, interesting, and wildly ambitious things are afoot in the world of Bitcoin and blockchains. I give you Zerocash, a completely anonymous currency; Ethereum, a blockchain platform designed to decentralize much of the Internet; and sidechains, a proposal to accelerate the evolution of Bitcoin itself. Any one of these could conceivably become a very big deal. All three? Prick up your ears.
Of Bitcoins And Blockchains
If you’re not au fait with blockchains, your head may already be swimming. Some background: Bitcoin, the infamous cryptocurrency, is built on a new kind of distributed-consensus technology called a blockchain, which allows transactions to be securely stored and verified without any centralized authority at all, because (to oversimplify) they are validated by the entire network.
Its success has spawned scores of variant cryptocurrencies, known as “altcoins,” the most famous of which is Dogecoin. But Bitcoin remains, by far, the big dog.
If you control more than half of the computations that power any cryptocurrency, then you can spend the same money more than once: a “51% attack.” Altcoins are especially vulnerable. But the stunning amount of computing power being poured into the Bitcoin network renders it (probably) effectively immune to such an attack, as per this mindboggling graph from blockchain.info–
The Bitcoin mining network is currently performing some three hundred quadrillion hash computations per second to secure and verify Bitcoin transactions. (If you think that’s environmentally wasteful, compare it to gold mining.) Meanwhile, despite its much-publicized decline of late, Bitcoin still has a collective market capitalization of nearly $5 billion, twice what it was a year ago.
Why You Should Care
Bitcoin is only mildly interesting as a store of value; there are many good alternatives. It’s more interesting as a means to transfer money to anywhere and anyone, with greater speed and lower transaction fees than most alternatives, with no ID requirements.
But it’s really interesting because it’s the world’s first form of programmable money.
Many people don’t appreciate that Bitcoin supports a simple scripting language which can orchestrate transactions. (In fact all transactions actually run as scripts.) This language already supports cases such as: deposits that automatically revert after a period of time, escrow transactions, transactions which rely on some external condition (albeit in a complex way that requires a third-party “oracle”), and more.
What are all of the potential applications of fully programmable money? Especially if the capabilities of that scripting language are expanded? I don’t know, and neither do you. It’s the proverbial whole new ball game.
But progress is tricky. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency powered and secured by a truly gargantuan mining network, but because it’s worth so much, and its network is so widespread, changes to Bitcoin itself are necessarily promulgated very slowly, and experimentation is done with extreme tentative caution. So we can try out new kinds of blockchains and cryptocurrencies (like Ethereum and Zerocash), or we can rely on the value, scarcity and (technical) stability of Bitcoin, but we can’t do both. Right?
…Wrong, says Adam Back.
Sidechains: Back, Hill, and Blockstream
The “three hundred quadrillion hashes” mentioned up above refer to attempts to satisfy the Hashcash proof-of-work function that Adam Back invented way back in 1997, used today to verify Bitcoin transactions. Now Back is back with a new proposal: sidechains, which would allow Bitcoins (and other blockchain assets) to be transferred between blockchains.
**Back and co. are not acting purely out of technical benevolence.** He and a group of co-founders, including several core Bitcoin developers, headed by former Zero-Knowledge Systems CEO Austin Hill, have a launched a startup called Blockstream. According to Coindesk, they have already raised $15 million in an ongoing funding round, and added Reid Hoffman to their board. Their exact business remains mysterious, but is built around sidechains. (The sidechain code itself will apparently be open-source. See Blockstream’s recent Reddit AMA.)
To quote the sidechains white paper (PDF):
[deleted to save space]
Blockstream has many other influential fans, including Vinod Khosla and Gavin Andresen, chief scientist of the Bitcoin Foundation (who also recently did an AMA):
There are critics, although the most visible, from Peter Todd, still stresses that “90% of the ideas in sidechains are good ideas.” His chief complaint is that either sidechains will still be vulnerable to 51% attacks, or Bitcoin miners will become more centralized, more powerful, and more dangerous. (There is also some rather more histrionic criticism.)
It’s worth noting that while one form of sidechain — a so-called “federated peg” — can be created today, for sidechains which require no external trust beyond the blockchain, some form of change to the core Bitcoin protocol will be required. At this point, though, such a change seems (to me) an inevitability.
Ethereum and Zerocash
Sidechains are far from the only “Bitcoin 2.0″ project, although they do have the unusual feature that, as far as I know, all other such projects could be built atop sidechains. The two which interest me most are Ethereum and Zerocash. (And not just me: to quote Back in the AMA, “i’m waiting for the zerocash sidechain :)“.)
Bitcoin is not anonymous. Every transaction’s sender, receiver, and amount are recorded in the blockchain’s public record. The “sender” and “receiver” are Bitcoin addresses, not names, but if anyone connects your identity to an address, its entire Bitcoin history will be apparent to everyone. (There are workarounds, but they’re flawed.) Zerocash, authored by a group of cryptographic academics, is a blockchain protocol wherein senders, receivers, and amounts are all kept entirely anonymous. In a world where privacy is withering away like ice in summer, a little more anonymity would be a welcome development.
Ethereum is another separate project scheduled to launch its “genesis block” this winter. You have to admire its creators’ ambition: its blockchain supports a full Turing-compete programming language intended to power not just programmable money but also financial derivatives, voting systems, identity registries, reputation systems, decentralized file storage, decentralized autonomous operations(!), and more. They recently raised 30,000 bitcoins, or some $14 million at current prices, by selling their own currency, “ether,” and its blockchain’s “genesis block” is due to launch this winter.
Ethereum already supports sidechains, too, out of the box. But also–you could take a Bitcoin sidechain and clone Ethereum on it! Sorry if this all hurts your head.
Warnings and Conclusions
If you’re thinking: wait, the Ethereum people sold their own made-up digital currency for someone else’s made-up digital currency, which will now be pegged against more new made-up currencies? And people trade cold hard US dollars for these? This is snake-oil nonsense! let me assure you: it’s possible that you may ultimately be proved right. But I don’t think so. Blockchains, and the new monetary applications that blockchains make possible, seem to me to be a sufficiently powerful and interesting innovation that cryptocurrencies–as a class–do in fact have inherent value, not least because you can do things with them that you can’t with traditional fiat currency.
This is highly anecdotal, but at a Blockstream event this week, I spoke to multiple people working at startups with transaction-based business models, whose companies are already up and running using traditional currency … who are now beginning to move towards Bitcoin’s blockchain as a substrate for their transactions. Not because they’re True Bitcoin Believers, but because it just makes practical and technical sense. I strongly suspect that the number of such people will begin to grow rather large as we move through the next iterations of blockchain technology.

Motions to dismiss are designed to be drastic remedies that movants almost never win. They are filed before a defendant even files a responsive pleading to the original complaint.  Defense attorneys love them because they generate fees.  In fact, a claim can totally lack merit and get by a motion to dismiss.  This is because a claimant (usually a plaintiff, sometimes a defendant making a counter claim) only needs to allege a legal claim in most cases to survive such a motion; whether the claim is true or not is a separate question.  Basically, a defendant making such a motion says, "I'll spot you factual allegations from the complaint; but, so what, no alleged facts in the complaint amount the legal conclusions you're raising."  For the most part, no substance or counter-facts can really be raised in such a motion.  Also, defeating such a motion is pretty easy because a claimant can often amend the complaint as a defensive tactic to such a motion so that it does make a claim.  So, this is outcome was the probable outcome and says nothing about the case.

These are good and reasonable explanations.  However, they don't mean there is no conflict b/c they don't address whether BS profits from the desired outcome of the block size debate, but they may justify it.

Don't know.  The rationale underlying my post was that paying tx fees is what separates spam from non-spam.  If a person is willing to pay for the space their transaction uses, then the tx is not spam and shouldn't be judged in that manner (anti-censorship, b/c of a tx's speech-like properties etc., and all that).  
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:35:47
In a world where transaction fees (which are growing) are functionally a prerequisite to a transaction's inclusion in a block, how can one identify spam from non-spam?        
     
If you have to pay to play, calling any such tx "spam" seems like an convenient untruth.

Ha, I don't know that wells fargo could survive such a stress test on their network.    
But interesting point nonetheless - i don't think banks require notice from a receiving account holder to receive a wire transfer.  It seems that a person could absolutely wreak havoc on someone else by sending them a lot of wire transfers and triggering those receiving fees.  Such an attack would be expensive for the sender, but that's not to say it may not be worth the cost to the attacker (I hereby declare such an attack to be called a "Fargo".)

A big problem is not disregarding what has been told to Mike and Gavin; rather it is that what has been told to be the case (or unsafe as it were) comes without explanation and analysis as to why existing small-block-concerns should outweigh benefits of a move to XT in the short-term, etc. (at least not an easily find-able statement on the matter).  The problem is further compounded when long analysis by Gavin and Mike is not directly responded to or when said analysis looks like its brushed aside without much more than a quick skim and a "that's dumb" type comment (including calls to BTC Foundation to revoke Gavin's title; totally out of line, btw). Good, easy to read explanations help the economic majority decide (possibly an explanation for why Gavin and Mike's roll out of XT seemed to generate a lot of buzz).

I will concede the answer to the question is probably not the type of answer the questioner was looking for.  I'm more impressed (not the right word) w/ using the answer to build a strawman argument.      
TBF - the standard for raising the blocksize offered is interesting an worth considering: only raise blocksize when it creates a path to increasing the value of bitcoins.  The approach to developing in that world is transactional - if users want X-service from bitcoin, they must be prepared to pay for the service.  I definitely think the developers, who are all doing what they think is right despite differing opinions on a lot of different matters, deserve to be rewarded for their work. I'd be interested to hear more perspectives on the 'standard' and the 'hire bitcoin' concept.

Some Feedback.             
I think you're missing some analysis on the size and the no-entity/no-person to attack issues.       
   
First, "Minimal" anything isn't necessary or sufficient to protect the network. IMHO, all you need is permissionless access to CPU, Bandwidth, and Storage irrespective of size. Second, a problem with focusing on keeping various tech requirements "minimal" is that the term, like evaluations of what is too expensive, is totally vague because it is totally relative. Minimal storage capacity 10 years ago is different than what it is today (so is the cost of said storage). Third, even if "minimal" requirements get locked in or become the policy, users still must depend on and are subject to government in big ways when using Bitcoin (e.g., internet access/provider requirements, undersea cables, satellites, internetkillswitches, etc). Bitcoin lives in the wild where governments live.  Governments can ban or regulate third-party providers on which the ecosystem depends. Consequently, an amicable co-existence with governments might be a better strategy for BTC's long-term survival (and clearly companies like Bitfury and Blockstream know this - look at their Boards, Staffs, etc. - [Bitfury had a write up in *Politico* last week noting another former Whitehouse hire]( ([And here]( - btw, I like how that press release is all about Blockchain and not Bitcoin).
    
Regarding the no-person/entity to attack concept - this is a good protective measure in theory, but I doubt it is really being utilized optimally at the moment: there is way too much censorship in the various communication channels to the point that it is pretty clear who the controlling parties are.  In law, a partnership entity can be construed by a court out of facts and circumstances even when the individual "partners" do not think of themselves as partnered/aligned/working with anyone.  Consequently, the way development decisions currently get made is probably not sufficient to avoid government interference - the process would need to be way more open for that.         
      
Overall, I think you assume too much about Bitcoin's role vis-a-vis the government.  I don't think Satoshi was trying to destabilize or totally avoid governments so much as he was trying to get governments out of the money-making business, especially regarding internet commerce. In other words, anti-govt != distrusting governments. Why does this matter? Because not all users are concerned about KYC/AML or various other government requirements. Re-tooling bitcoin to be totally free from and anti- government interference is the hijacking people refer to here often.      
      
EDITs - just regular clean-ups, nothing substantive.

I understand the fear and I don't think its totally unfounded, but I think that the quoted material expressing that fear contains a lot of hyperbole.      
        
First, no businesses were named as as examples and other data was offered to support the position - so, this is just a unsubstantiated claim atm.  Second, to the extent someone uses bitcoin from within the borders of a government, there will be some regulation - like paying taxes on income or gain. Obviously. In other words, the bar trying to be set is probably unrealistic to begin with.         
       
It would be much better IMHO to focus on changing government positions on Bitcoin from the political processes or other normal communication channels than taking a route that is inherently adverse and threatening to governments around the world (there is quite a bit of social movement literature about dismantling the master's house with the master's tools as effective strategy for change). Doing so just places a target on your back - some folks say Satoshi left when some folks kicked the hornets nest by trying to raise funds for wikileaks with a bitcoin campaign.        
       
  
As I said in my previous post, I think some prominent companies know this and are proceeding accordingly. Pro-privacy positions often seem to be conflated with anti-govt positions.   I'm sympathetic - its so easy to do (I'm totally guilty of this conflation from time to time).  For some companies, figuring out how to clearly and cleverly distinguish relevant 'pro-privacy' and 'anti-govt' foundations underlying their offerings might be a really smart way to spend some of the marketing budget.

Your Medium article is good, but I think smart contracts are being used already w/ frequency in the digital currency ecosystem - margin trading on the various digital currency exchanges is the most obvious example to me (lending to traders, who promise to repay w/ interest).   
Had not thought about the point made about all btc spends constituting smart contracts prior to seeing this thread - its interesting idea. I think of contracts from a legal perspective - my background - where there must be an offer, acceptance, and consideration for a contract to form. Consequently, I am not sure how every spend qualifies (what about donations, for example, where there is no consideration?) - my hesitation here might be the result of some tech. ignorance RE: spends. Anyway, kudos all around for good discussion points.

Genuine question here: How do you know the actors are malicious and that Hearn was employed by the banks at the time of the XT hype?  Both of those points, if true, would probably be of interest to lots of users in favor of raising the blocksize or letting the market have a say in that.  Personally, I have not seen any compelling evidence to support the malicious actors and Hearn points, but I am not above being wrong and I will happily check whatever is out there that I might have missed.  Can you post some links on these points or give me some solid direction so I can see what I can dig up?

* Slide 7 - Should it not be 8 yrs instead of 7?  IIRC, the first draft of the whitepaper came out around Halloween of 2008 - seems like you could round up here (even if you count creation from the genesis block - its only a few months and your slides will stay current longer).      
* Slide 14 - What are the limits to expansion?  Are they natural or artificial? Who is measuring and what tools do they use?      
* Slides 17-21 - It would be more accurate to clarify that this meeting was subset of developers, not all attended and not all are in agreement with the Core team (Core, by its own admission, can and does not control Bitcoin...).

To add - Threads like this one where there is genuine discussion about what's happening in the background on the development side of things are helpful irrespective of "sides."

Interesting graphic. Not really sure what to make of it. If I had the time, I might compare it to other currencies or other marketable assets (metals, collectibles, real estate, etc) to see if there are an parallels. Initially, the suggestion that market cap correlates with transaction volume seems plausible. From that perspective, it also seems plausible that scalability could impact transaction volume and therefore marketcap. However, and just brainstorming ways the logic might not hold, it seems like there's at least two built-in presumptions that might be problematic: 1) that the market can't adapt/or at least that adaptations must fit the market and not the other way around; and 2) that the market values efficiency of transactions over any other characteristic of bitcoin/Bitcoin.
       
I'm not sure the extent to which the first presumption is true. It seems possible that the utility of bitcoin/Bitcoin could, overtime, overwhelm the market's need to trade at will and/or w/o concern for fee markets (I suppose I presume a rational market, and there may be good reasons that's a bad assumption). For instance, we know that users of various web-platforms adapt to said platforms despite missing highly desirable functions and strong objections related thereto (e.g., some users of Coinbase have been upset at their efforts to meet compliance laws but despite strong feelings, ultimately they re-calibrate their expectations of the service and use it when appropriate). In essence, the market could adapt to whatever bitcoin becomes - although that may impact the slope of its upward mass adoption trajectory (I'm just assuming there is such a slope, too busy to look it up). Finally, this presumption may not adequately consider market education. People understand bitcoin better overtime; I believe some participants now understand bitcoin less as a currency and more as a commodity. Why couldn't the market's understanding of bitcoin evolve just as it might for any individual participant?        
Regarding the second presumption, transactions merely represent a need at a particular point in time (need to transfer). Transaction need isn't necessarily a good gauge of a market's will/sentiment since said need doesn't reflect all, or event most, needs in an ecosystem (i.e., preservation/store of value). Further, many markets have tons of interest and value despite being prone to experiencing tight liquidity (i.e., real estate can be a great store of wealth even when the real estate market is tilted towards buyers (over-supply). In this sense, small block proponents who emphasize fee-markets as being a good thing may be on to something (although, you present interesting analysis that fee-markets will persist no matter block size). If I were researching this myself or with a team, I think I'd focus on trying to define the needs of the potential market and looking for parallels elsewhere - similar to what I mentioned at the start of this post.       
Having said all that, I lean in favor of a blocksize increase. Good discussion - it helps tease out some of the complexity underlying this issue.

Along those lines, the complaint should be the opposite: he's too trusting, not that he's untrustworthy (disclaimer: I don't actually think that, everyone is susceptible to a little a social engineering and it is possible that happened here). 
@_date: 2016-10-12 15:46:54
There is no way to respond efficiently, but I suspect you know that (top trollin' skills, mad respect).  Anyway, Satoshi's early writings, including posts at the P2P Foundation, suggest that he had a problem trusting governments especially in the realm of money. John Nash has similar writings.  Disrupting that entrenched system is a powerful political act.  Money itself is power.  Power is politics.  If Bitcoin is money, then it is also politics because it is also a form of power.  Imagine what happens to North Korea (or other repressive regime) when internet gets beamed-in by Google or Facebook and those people have unfettered access to information and global markets.  What happens when NKoreans get access to bitcoin?  SpaceX recently had an incident.  They were carrying Facebook's internet-beaming satellite (designed to bring internet to where its currently not available because of infrastructure or governments).  They still don't know why the incident happened, but I can guess....  Setting aside the internal debates in the community - collectively, bitcoiners are engaged in politics simply by creating new markets and competing mechanisms for transferring and storing value. Internal debates/disputes have the potential to be little proxy battles for global politics (hence all the "malicious actor" talk that comes from both sides). You simply can't escape politics by focusing on the protocol because the protocol is made by people who are making choices based on motives, skills, philosophy, etc.

@_date: 2016-05-05 17:38:43
If a person (or group) is going to claim to be involved w/ Satoshi, know Satoshi, or is Satoshi, they alone have the burden of proof. In that world, the presumption is that the current state of affairs is the truth (i.e., Wright is not Satoshi) UNTIL that presumption is overcome w/ credible evidence, at which time the burden of proof shifts to the doubters. The continued doublespeak just digs their hole deeper by showing they're not trustworthy, candid, or honest. Plus, JVP has recent communications about BTC pumps and whatnot. I don't see why this isn't presumed to be part of a market manipulation plan that is timed w/ halving.

There are a number of interesting features associated with this product that aren't getting much love in this thread:     
    
1. Buying one places the buyer's current "on-chain" value  (and history) "off-chain" until the block is sold again for BTC. You can easily launder BTC this way - that might be worth 5 btc for some folks. One target market could be hackers  (hypothetically, I don't think that's the intent w/ this product or BTCC) or folks looking for a clean transaction record. 
     
2. A block can survive power failures and can be stored totally off-grid.

Be prepared for the price to go down in the short-term - it tends to happen immediately following block reward reductions with other crypto-currencies, and there is no reason to hope to against the trend.
