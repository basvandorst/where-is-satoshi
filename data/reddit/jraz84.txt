Kinda feel this should have been a DogeCoin purchase.

Casual btc user and fanboy here. Can anyone with knowledge in these areas comment on how likely it is that a decision has already been made? 
ETF decidings don't really seem like last-minute stays of lethal execution phoned in by the governor at midnight. 
Could the 'voss boys really present anything more now that would sway the decision one way or another?
Is it quite likely that they or the SEC knows something they're not letting slip to the public? And if so, for what reason?

I personally don't think BTC has hit its peak yet, but I also doubt it will remain relevant for long.  It's a bit counter-intuitive, but as people become more interested in cryptocurrency as a whole, interest in bitcoin will eventually begin to wane in favor of digital currencies that actually "do something"....and do that something much faster.
A decentralized financial ledger is great and BTC is on top now because it was the first widely accepted tech of its kind (like AOL, Netscape, Myspace, etc.)
However, in the future, I reckon people will demand a crypto with better tricks up its sleeve if it is to really go mainstream.
Anyway,  trying to get rich in the meantime.

I think what most people mean by this is closer to:
“We don’t like MySpace, but we love social media.”
I don’t think they’re saying that Bitcoin is shit, but that the first major implementation of a new technology isn’t as exciting as the potential of the technology itself. 
They’re waiting for what they believe will be the next wave. The Facebook and Instagram of blockchain. 
You can, of course, argue for or against Bitcoin being that exact wave with people till you’re blue in the face.

Not a hater, and there are undoubtedly a plethora of shitcoins floating around the cryptoverse, but how can some of you honestly believe that any decentralized asset other than BTC is utter garbage??
Personally, I want to think it's more likely that Bitcoin's rise will help pave the way for other genuinely useful alts. 
Hell yes...definitely back BTC, but don't pigeonhole yourself into a mentality where every other coin is your "enemy" and doomed to fail. 
Crypto is young, and a rising tide lifts all ships, innit.  ��

How could anyone look at this and doubt that bitcoin's mass public adoption is just around the corner?
