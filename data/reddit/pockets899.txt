I realize my chances of winning are pretty damn slim but I figure you never know.
Your the real MVP rekcahxfb!
@_date: 2016-08-31 16:13:34
No problem you still waiting for it to show up?  Usually after 24 hours the transaction will get dropped and you can rebroadcast it.

Also what happens if Coinkite were to go down or fail?  Could you still retrieve btc you stored in the multisig vault?
@_date: 2017-03-29 15:25:08
I would only reccomend 
Been using it for a year and its really good and when I signed up KYC was pretty non-invasive.
@_date: 2016-06-10 06:29:38
When can we buy more than 1 bitcoin kind of pointless until then.
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:37:52
Any idea when that feature will be available?  I'm outside the US as well :)
@_date: 2017-01-29 09:14:59
IS this site legit is seems scammish.
@_date: 2017-01-14 09:54:21
Ledger nano S or KeepKey

Agreed but remember that most of the time political views are passed down from generation  to generation.
Not to make this political  but how else do middle and poor class whites continue to vote for a party that serves the interest of the top 1% and continually fucks these people over time and time again.
In concolusion, don't be an asshole in life because this story proves karma is fucking real as shit.  How else would you explain a fuckin SSD containing 17 BTC burning up,  burning up the backup AND fucking up  the house.  Man this dudes whole family  just got rekked.
Still worried about immigrants or  do  you have more  pressing  matters to attend to now that your life  is in shambles?

Multibit is absolute trash of a wallet I had problems myself luckily never put BTC on there.  Only use hardware wallets i recommend ledger nano s or a keepkey.  0 problems.

Hey bro I pm'd you hit me back looking to move some neteller for bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-08 05:23:14
LOL no thanks dont wanna pay 10% juice
@_date: 2017-08-04 06:52:07
I hate kicking someone when  they are down but 100% will  agree with ZombieTony.  I saw a post you  made  about  "rekking" sanctuary cities and  have a massive disdain for immigrants when lets be honest immigrants are the reason the USA has maintained its  economic prowess despite  the general population (south) going  to  shit.
Hope karma taught you a valuable lesson to  have compassion for others and not be an asshole.   Get rekked.
@_date: 2016-12-10 14:06:44
Yeah of course you can I dont know why these guys are saying its impossible.  Just send through cashila/bitwala as a SWIFT transfer and pay 0.5 to 1% fee.  Not a big deal Ive done it a few times myself.
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:50:07
Jaxx wallet is trash switch to copay.
@_date: 2016-10-27 01:36:16
That is absurdly low right now since its only 25% of recommended fee.  Sorry just hope it confirms within 24 hours nothing you can do really.
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:29:21


Holy crap those transaction fees are low good luck it might take a few days for it to go through.
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:13:21
OK got it  appreciate  the help man I'll  do some reading up.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:55:43
Oh ok what if hypothetically the only  income  I  derived in  a  year was  from cashing out bitcoin.  What would my tax liability  be  then?
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:04:47
Ok so if in a given year I cashed out say $35,000 worth of BTC and because  it  was through the  sale of  capital gains I would pay 0% but would still be subject to normal income tax  even  though I  didnt  work?
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:31:31


So If I read this correctly lets say I make  $20k/year and pay ordinary  income tax if I  only cash  out lets say $16k/year in btc gains does that mean my capital gains  for the bitcoin  is 0% and i  just pay normal income  tax  on my salary?
Just checking in :)
