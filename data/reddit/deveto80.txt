If you are in US I would suggest registering on Gemini. 
Wallet for few bucks:  this one is good... check it out.

Where Do you buy BTC? Any stable source for that and not completely overpriced?

gdax is the subsidiary of Coinbase but for the more experienced users. I was not able to buy or sell on gdax yet, as they couldn't confirm my driver's license yet. 
I found a good opportunity to buy at blockchain.info yesterday. You can buy through coinify and it worked good and was a bit cheapter than at coinbase.

Just registered on cex and the prices are huge or just the price for bitcoin is way to high on cex. 
For 100 EUR I may get around 0.0101 Bitcoin on Coinbase and only 0.0098 on CEX

I believe its still worth it. The Bitcoin will rise:
1. Approve of futures on US market
2. At 15K will fall again because of stupidity and that will be the second time for a big invest.
3. Unfortunately, I could not buyin 2 days ago, because my regular platform was out of service as usual. So Im wating until it will fall again :)

I was kinda also hoping to see here some real talk... but no way...

This is how it goes... A lot of superb and well-known ppl were forecasting and saying the bubble will pop and 10K... so I believe a lot of ppl were afraid of this and started to sell, so the wave began to grow...

Thank you, so is this real - I can buy cheap, transfer the bitcoin and sell them again? 
And why are they different? Ok, I will google it. Thanks for your reply. EDIT: Ok got it :) Thanks a lot. So possible, but I willneed to check the prices for buy and transfer.
