Will this version be released soon? And will segwit be deployed on time as said in the core road map, anyone know?

Appreciate the info, hopefully they can keep somewhat on schedule although they already seem to be a bit behind I'd rather they make sure everything works properly before being implemented on main net 
@_date: 2016-04-09 05:05:52
At least it's a step in the right direction hopefully better late then never still applies, it's also not as if a block size increase isn't on the table

This subreddit man... How is this good news for bitcoin in any sense. neither bitcoin related subreddit is useful both sides are so nonsensical and there is no middle ground, there is no place to get good information anymore in terms of bitcoin other than finding bitcoin related news and podcasts yourself and formulating an opinion based on those sources of information

I think selling now would be a bad idea, we are in the midst of panic and you never really want to sell when everyone else is selling
My opinion is if your have some money to live off of use that and wait it out  a bit longer, stop trying to recoup losses by hedging more bets since the money is important, if you can't then sell but I'd still wait for a better opportunity it won't be hard to get rid of being only 300 btc
Just like during the rally up to 1200 everyone was claiming btc was going to 10k, saying bitcoin will go to 100 during a downtrend is no different 
I've been a bitcoiner since 2011 and nothing has changed fundamentally, bitcoin is still working and is an incredibly useful / efficient technology

I would argue the fact that all this time was panic.. We've certainly been in a bear market but there was also an incredibly long period of stability, imo the correction happened at first and the panic was only recent in which is what we are experiencing now 
Its his prerogative whether he sells or not, I have only immensely profited from bitcoin so I can't understand what op is going through even if bitcoin dropped to 200 I'd still be rich for my age group

Am i missing somwthing here? Why not just take the wallet file and then bring it to another machine?

Realistically though I doubt that we will see a similar rise in price in such a dramatic way, around that time the bitcoin hearings were taking place and after the govt basically said bitcoin was here to stay the price rocketed. Also this was during the time mtgox was operating as basically a ponzi and while some had suspicions it was still unclear that they were broke, those with money on the exchanges were buying whatever bitcoin they could to try to get out but they were buying nothing, gox was the leading exchange at the time and this event brought us to gold parity before crashing down
All in all I do think the price will rise with the block halving and a much clearer future of the blocksize debate, doubt that it will increase 500%

Basically it says that 404 is the lowest price that shows support and using fibonnaci (a trading formula or strategy) 418 represents a price that crosses one of the points in it
Longing or buying at 404 and shorting (selling) at 418 is a relatively low risk for scalping (profiting off of buying andecision selling btc)

Gox did not halt trading when they were collapsing ... btce has been around for as long as I've been a bitcoiner which is 5 years now and they have been the most reliable exchange, doubt they are pulling a fast one

My experience at the adiamo was the opposite, was in Vegas about a year and a half ago and it was very quick and painless, the server was  ecstatic when I said I wanted to pay in BTC, iPad was promptly brought out and paid for dinner for our party of 12 in an instant after scanning the qr code, everyone was impressed 
On that note, I really think that bitcoin has a place in our society but do not think that everyday use is going to be its main function, at least not in the immediate future, debit and credit cards are just way easier

Nothing is wrong with segwit itself the issue is that it is a stepping stone for layer 2 technologies, 
@_date: 2016-10-11 07:27:28
How is it not as I describe, the LN is basically a hub of transactions where they are grouped before they are sent off to the bitcoin main chain, I have extensively read up on both sides of the matter and it makes no sense to do this when some of the core devs themselves have said that 2mb would not be an issue to do, 
So why stall all this time when its obvious that anytime the mention of forking off to 2mb the price seems to rise, there has been 2 instances of this within the last few months. 
Say what you will but any supporter of core currently is not a supporter of the original white paper of bitcoin, which is the biggest reason most of us early adopters even put money into bitcoin

Easy to steal the spotlight when no one with different opinion was even allowed at the event 
@_date: 2016-10-10 22:40:33
I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2011 and have a majority of my coins from when I bought back then, during that bug event everyone was told to update their client to the most recent update and everyone did so in a reasonable amount of time 
Ethereum did a hard fork to rollback transactions on the immutable ledger, this is to scale Bitcoin to allow more transactions not taint the blockchain. No one knows for certain how it would turn out but I'm fairly certain majority of the user base wants scaling, upgrading to 2mb would be something that has been done before considering when Bitcoin first started it had 200kb blocks and upgraded to its current 1mb 
@_date: 2016-10-10 22:43:43
I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2011 and Bitcoin had scaled just fine when it was .25mb blocks to its 1mb blocks today. Why would I move to alts when I benefit more if Bitcoin were to succeed? If this layer 2 tech goes off then yes I'm going to divest but I've made millions of dollars off Bitcoin and would rather see it scale than it moving to lightning network 
@_date: 2016-10-10 19:58:30
Yes which goes against the original vision of what Bitcoin is supposed to be.. off chain scaling or second layer tech is needing an intermediary to do a transaction which doesn't make Bitcoin a PEER 2 PEER digital currency.
@_date: 2016-10-10 19:18:13
Funny how something that was originally being sold as a fix for malleability and not scaling is now being sold as a scaling solution. The only reason the block size hasn't been raised is because of blockstream, Bitcoin has undergone several hard fork without failure and if segwit, an incredibly complex and untested solution, is allowed to happen then this second layer tech garbage is going to hinder the original system of what Bitcoin was/is. Bitcoin is a DECENTRALIZED P2P uncontrolled money, that is untrue if LN becomes our realty
@_date: 2016-10-10 20:00:25
The conference was mostly about segwit. No one with a different opinion was allowed to speak at the event because it was funded by blockstream 
Big surprise there, 
@_date: 2016-10-10 19:22:01
Yes it's probably even more complex than segwit.... Oh wait...

ViaBTC has been talking about mining unlimited for some time now.
