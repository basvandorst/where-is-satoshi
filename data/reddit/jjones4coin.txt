Pretty sure channels form a web, and that direct bi-directional channels between end users are not necessary.  Ever hear the 7 degrees of separation concept?  Might not be true for off grid forest hermits who are only in contact with one or two other equally isolated people (or for pre-contact tribes) but it's true or very close for the rest of us and certainly for anyone who transacts with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:21:05
ah, yeah, if there's no mesh network.
I do think that the network will form quickly though, and that the only thing that may take a long time is for certain individuals/entities to connect to it.  So with them, you would not be able to make LN transactions but not so much because the mesh net wasn't there but simply because they were willfully not yet connected to it for whatever reason.
I think the network itself will emerge quickly and organically, and look like a mycelial network if visualized.

 That won't be for a while (about 120 years)
 The transaction fees are paid to miners too, they're not ONLY working for newly minted coin, they're also skimming a bit from all on chain economic activity
 As long as adoption continues, price will go up, and diminishing block reward will not stop mining from being profitable.  They will simply compete for a smaller piece of a bigger pie (less BTC worth more money).  If BTC price makes mining very profitable with electricity prices, miners upscale and new players begin to mine, increasing total hash power steadily - but if btc value to electricity cost are such that mining is only slightly profitable for people already equipped with most efficient equipment, but the time to break even on new equipment is insanely long, hash power increase will level out or slow down by a lot - and if btc value goes down enough that it's not profitable for any miner (even with cheapest electricity) to mine and doing so results in a net loss, many miners put their operations on hold, difficulty drops due to decreased hash power, and equilibrium is found.
Realistically there's no single threshold below which suddenly nobody can make money mining.  There's a bunch of different thresholds at different electricity price points.  If price/difficulty make it unsustainable for people who pay high electricity prices, they will stop mining before people who pay average rates, and they will stop mining before people who pay low rates.  Each time large groups of people power down their operations, it will slow the decline in profitability/sustainability for the others, and equilibrium will be found.
I do think it would be better if difficulty adjusted way more frequently than once every couple weeks as I think this would make the network more resilient if the price ever crashes and brings profitability down with it, but I'm no expert and trust the devs have surely put some thought into this and know what they're doing.

and yet when people make price predictions for the future quantified in dollars, they're usually speaking in terms of CURRENT dollars.
he's saying that he thinks Satoshi dollar parity will be achievable in part because the dollar will lose almost all of it's value, whereas when other people predict 100x gains over a certain time frame they usually mean that it'll actually become 100 times more valuable, not that the unit we're measuring value with (dollars) will change.
it's an important distinction.  No we don't speak in '30 years ago dollars' but it *is* natural to speak of the future in today dollars.

uh I'm totally in favor of controlling your own keys and decentralizing (ie. decentralized exchanges) but lower liquidity on exchanges increases volatility, and buying on exchanges counters downward pressure with upward pressure.  Miners must also sell to cover costs which puts downward pressure on price even when sentiment is neutral, so giving them liquidity is good, without liquidity sellers push the price even lower.
it would make more sense to sell privately and buy through an orderbook than to just withdraw from exchanges entirely, if positively affecting the value is your objective.
I fully agree that centralized exchanges are not trustless though, and that this is contrary to what attracts most people to the space including myself, and that using them is taking unnecessary risk, and that if you're not in control of your own private keys it's not your coin, I just thought I'd point out that if everyone stops buying on exchanges but not everyone stops selling on them, the price would go nearly to zero, and the spot rate is based on the exchanges.

decentralized exchanges are trustless and eliminate the centralized middle man liability.  They're a bit more tedious to use but still very straight forward.  BisQ even has fiat crypto pairings but I've only used it for crypto crypto pairings.
...and their volume is too negligible to affect market wide pricing (so trades on central exchange still determines the price movement) but that could change with increased adoption.
mtgox is an example of something we could avoid repeating if decentralized exchanges were the norm, and we could have more privacy and more resilience to regulatory whims - there's a lot of reasons adoption would be good

very quick parabolic is not adoption as much as just speculation -- longer time frame parabolic (like late 2015 through most of 2017 bull run) strikes me as having much more proper adoption.  When it goes 6-10x (or more) well under 90 days it's typically soon to crash.  When it takes a year or longer for that kind of relative change, I feel like it has much better odds of continuing upwards for another year or longer.


if a stable price causes anything to stagnate it'll be the wild speculation -- true believers in benefits beyond gains will not be discouraged by price stability from continuing to develop and participate in the ecosystem -- and many people are scared away from adoption by volatility (especially if they have short term turnover needs and/or lack the long term confidence that some of us enthusiasts have) and feel better about the idea of doing business in crypto if they think it's more stable.  I don't think it's utility will stagnate from stability.  I definitely don't think development will stagnate from stability.  If nothing completely devastating happens, adoption *will* continue, and price stability of all things won't stop it.  It may, however, slow purely speculative insanity and I don't think that's such a bad thing, not that I don't also like gains or hold for that reason.
Bitcoin adoption will continue through thick and thin, speculators will come and go.  I was long of the opinion that another gox like incident would be prevented by way of arbitrage and couldn't happen again as long as no single exchange was as dominant as gox was, but now my only fear is that the whole tether thing will fall apart, but this time the insolvency is in a form that can be traded and that moves to other exchanges -.-
I hope the tether catastrophe never happens at all or happens sooner rather than later, while sentiment is already low.  If it happened now, it would suck, but I think we'd still recover.  If the market recovers first and goes into the next bull run before the tetherpocalypse, it could trigger the *next* bear cycle and I could see it going much longer.  Tether failure is the only thing I'm really worried about, other than that I'm extremely optimistic.
Long parabolic &gt; fast parabolic
longer periods of sideways trading tend to be followed by longer slower parabolic moves.  Organic adoption happening over a long bull run (and partially driving it, obviously) makes gives more potential participants a positive impression of the whole thing than manic volatility and hype followed by a crash.

So you're poor because you're raising a family on less than 50k with no income that isn't passive income, and not paying rent for the place you're living in but don't own.  Got it.  Above median income for doing nothing, and a free roof over your head too.
I'll concede this to you sir, 50k is not much to support a family of 4 in this economy.  That being said, having that much income passively (as a landlord) and a free roof over your head puts you in a better position as a family of 4 than many most others.
Mortgage of 600 is very low where I'm from and most people born here in the last 25 years will never be able to afford to buy a home here.  Families who have been here for generations but don't own real estate are leaving because it's no longer affordable.  People who had real estate in the 90s or earlier are doing alright even if their income is not very much.   Modest houses are soon to average over $2mln unless there is a major correction.  We've all seen gentrification in neighborhoods, but it's interesting to see it slowly but surely happening to a large city in it's entirety and the surrounding area too.  Once we rezone agricultural land outside the city so that most food must be brought in from elsewhere, we'll see our own LA-like sprawl which might help the housing crisis short term but not be without it's consequences long term.

Answer could vary greatly depending on what kind of time travel you're talking.  Do you go back in time to a period in time where the earlier you is still doing the same earlier you things, but the now you (now in your perspective after you go back to the past relative to when you went back from, and future you relative to the time you went back to) exists at the same absolute time?  If so, the answer would be no, nothing changes in your recollection because you went back and looped through to where you now would be, and your past self (living what you remember) would only co-exist with the you who went back until said past self followed through with what you did by going back from/to the time that you did.  In this case, there wouldn't even technically be two of you even when your past self and future self exist within the same linear time period, it would merely be two different periods of personal existence overlapping in linear time.  You would remember everything as normal, going back in time (as your future self relative to that time) and preceding from there, knowing that your past self was simultaneously doing/experiencing what you remember already doing.  This would not be another you, but simply past you, with both periods overlapping in linear time starting from the point you went back to, and lasting until the time you went back from.
But if you meant what I suspect you did, going back not as your future self to a past time where your past self exists separately, but rather to a past point of your life, where you can do things differently, you are then doing an ethereum style hard fork on reality.  By acting differently based on your MEMORY of what happened when you did things the first way, you are necessitating that memory's existence to create the new time line, so you must have remembered when you went through with the old one up until the point you went back from.  You literally hit rewind, and then made and watched something else play out.  This is commonly known as groundhog day time travel, but ethereum made it reality, and while I like to think time travel is impossible because all of the paradoxical conundrums that hurt my brain to think about, I'll concede that if the simulation theory people are right, an ethereum style hard fork can very plausibly be done in what we consider RL too.

Time travel market manipulation exploits could be inadvertently self defeating.  Many early bitcoin investors already hodl more crypto capital than some pretty hefty mcap alts were worth just a year ago before the altcoin boom.  If one such person were to go back in time to buy one of the alts that made a 10,000%-30,000%  gain with tens of millions before that gain, that person could basically buy all of that alt that was on the market, but it wouldn't be a 10,000%-30,000% gain any more, because they would then be the defining force in the market.  If they bought it through an exchange (with bid/ask orderbook) they would make the illusion of far greater gains than it saw in the time line where the time travel exploit was not executed by pushing the price to infinity and beyond (/exaggerate) themselves due to insufficient liquidity, thus making for the most epic LOOKING market cap ever, but it wouldn't translate into actual wealth in any other form, because it would practically become that person's private currency (their stash dwarfing any hodlers by orders of magnitude).  Any residual hodlers with tiny portions of this massively inflated pie would either be winners by getting out before the time traveler crashes the market, but if they were true hodlers, they would be reluctant to use said currency to transact after seeing it's ludicrous gains, and the currency could simply die.  Time traveller could not cash out any meaningful proportion of their share without crashing the price to zero.  Perhaps the result would be a big hodl party where the market cap appeared to be hundreds of trillions but none would be used and none would be cashed because there would be no liquidity for the one person (time traveler) who bought too much too early to let an actual currency develop organically back down on earth where things actually make SOME kind of sense.
I hate to say it but economically this isn't much different from a massive premine except that it's not the devs in control of who gets it, but rather an outside adversary, but the devs &amp; pre-exploit adopters (who sell to the time traveler as he pushes the price to insanity and beyond) would still benefit, by selling what they already had for stupid prices to a foolhardy time traveler who broke the game he was trying to cheat.
Not saying such a scenario is an inevitability, just that time travellers should be careful, and try to be less extreme with their market exploits.  If someone went back and bought less than 1% of a circulating supply when it was cheap enough that they could, then never sold much too fast, they could get a lot more out of it by not fucking with it too hard and breaking it.  Then again, if they went too hard and broke it, I suppose they could just learn from their mistakes and go back and do it better, assuming there are no barriers to fucking time travel that is.

To be clear, I'm not disagreeing with you, just saying fiat credit is not the only reason.  Real estate obviously has intrinsic value and is obviously finite.  Yes I know there's tons but location matters and there isn't tons to go around where everyone wants it.
The fact that we measure the value of real estate in steadily depreciating fiat amuses me in this context

that's what you get for using currency as currency

Monero is the best solution right now.
privacy for Bitcoin would still be good.

years ago people kept saying "internet in it's infancy but this time it's happening faster"
There's a lot of points in time the internet could be considered to have begun, but I think anything much prior to '89 is so abstract it's meaningless.  I think the internet grew much faster and accomplished much more in it's first decade than bitcoin/blockchain, and in it's second decade it only advanced faster.
I'm a bitcoin/blockchain optimist and I'm very excited about the future, but if it's second decade doesn't change the face of life on earth like the internet's second decade, people should really stop making the comparison or stop saying as fast or faster but instead maybe "seemingly slower this time"
The one thing that I think could kick it into high gear is a side chain boom with as much innovation as you see with alt coin development, but all sharing a primary currency.  The implications of the two way peg go way beyond lightning.

and I'm sorry to hear your 2350% arbitrage attempt failed.  Usually there's a reason for THAT much difference, lol, but would have been sweet for you if it worked

while you are right lower cap coins can more easily see bigger gains, if that's where your gains are coming from, that's not arbitrage

you realize where the decimal is drawn or how many zeros there are is effectively arbitrary right?
5% is 5% regardless of whether it's 1:1.05 or 1,000,000:1,050,000
with bitcoin, the unit "bitcoin" is an arbitrary division of the total.  Instead of 21,000,000 there could have been 210,000,000 or 2,100,000 and it wouldn't make a difference if human behavior was the same
arbitrage between exchanges exploits RELATIVE difference in price (generally created by market inefficiency) where possible to do so.  Relative difference exists regardless of scales like market cap and arbitrary decimal placement and should not be confused with absolute difference.

I agree with you about the overlap and that extrapolating multiple steps makes no sense, but are you familiar with the concept of 6 degrees of separation?  In reality the median and/or average may or may not be more than 6 (very hard to do a reliable study on this) and there's definitely a bell curve (with some outlier pairings significantly more steps removed) as well as isolated exceptions (people who aren't connected by any amount of steps removed but only because they're completely isolated) but overall most people alive are not that many steps removed from most other people.
