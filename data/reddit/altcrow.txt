What's wrong with bitpay? (serious)

I think you misunderstand the LN. You don't need to connect to every shop you want to purchase something from. Consumers would most likely only have to connect to a couple central nodes to be able to access everyone. Only a couple channels to access everything. This way, once it's set up, it is relatively easy to maintain.

But people buy specialised hardware for bitcoin. Won't they just continue due to sunk cost fallacy?

TL;DR: Bitcoin is worthless because it is possible to make your own cryptocurrency.

AI definetly does, it is commonly used actually. AI or artificial intelligence is just simulating intelligent behaviour in computers. What you are referring to is AGI (artificial general intelligence). Computers are usually very good at one thing, but there it stops. If computers start to be able to respond in a meaningful manner to most everyday problems you throw at it, AGI has been achieved.  
  
I think OP was reffering to ANI (artificial narrow intelligence) chatbots like [cleverbot]( No disrespect meant by this comment. Just thought you should know.

Any tutorials for windows? I can't access my Linux PC for a couple days.

Not yet though, LN is still experimental.
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:26:08
Tbh, I don't mind a minimum of 5sat/byte. It's still fairly cheap but not devestating to the miners. Not that I care about the miners pursonally, but more miners means a more secure network after all.
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:01:38
Well you're the one trying to debunk it...

I guess you're right, but to me, spending money I don't have sounds crazy. I guess it doesn't work like that for everyone.

LN can have lower than 1sat/byte transactions. At your own risk though.

LN allows for instant transactions, which is exactly the type of thing we would need to use crypto for making off-line purchases. Because no one is going to wait 10 minutes to see if the transaction confirms. I think LN is a good thing. I'd like to hear your side of things though, why do you think LN is bad?
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:59:56
But even from that point of view, why 2000+ fees? With 200ish fees you'd clog up a lot more space.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:59:10
To quote the paper you referenced:  
 &gt; If  all  transactions  using  Bitcoin  were  on  the  blockchain,  to  enable
7 billion people to make two transactions per day,  it would require 24GB
blocks every ten minutes at best  
  
This is 1.26 exabytes of data every year. I think we can agree that is too much. I think if this type of mass-adoption happens, a combination is the easiest option as far as I can see.  
  
Also, how does blockchain profit from ofchain solutions? (Serious question, I don't know much about them.)
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:03:05
As soon as LN is perfected, this won't be a problem anymore. I just hope that happens at the right moment so it actually takes off.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:51:53
Yeah, him calling it "bitcoin core" instead of bitcoin was a big clue. (For newbies, bitcoin core is the name of a client, NOT a cryptocurrency.)

Diffculty only adjusts after every X blocks. Recently the hashpower of the network has increased, but the difficulty hasn't (yet). This means faster blocks, thuss more transactions confirmed.
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:46:28
True, lol, people are really good at lying to themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:27:33
I get that this isn't common sentiment in the bitcoin community, but taxes really aren't that bad. You're essentially giving money to to government to set up a system where people have to follow a set of rules. These rules ensure that people aren't running amok on the daily. I however, do think current taxpayer money isn't spent in the right areas, nor is it spent efficiently.
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:44:23
Thank you, was definetly an interesting read. It seems as though the current blocksize limit only allows for a maximum of 52.6 million users. As it seems most of the Bitcoin community is against increasing the block size, I wonder what solutions people will come up with. (If, ofcourse, this sentiment remains.)

Why lose money when you can achieve the exact same thing not losing money. The "fake" money on testnet is in every way equivalent to mainnet money.

Managed 2/3 without debt. Too early in life for a house, but I guess I'll probably need to loan money when I get to that. But I feel like it's different for a house compared to a coffee. Call me hypocritical if you wish to do so.

You do not, but contrary to mining, it barely costs anything.  
Reasons to run a full node include keeping the network (and your coins) extra secure and having a vote during hard forks.

If you can give me a link to that I would be very grateful.

If adoption stays the same and supply is the same, the price will not rise, but neither will it crash. It just stays the same.

Actually, bitcoin is deflationary, so eventually, even without extra people coming in, it will still keep price.

It definetly does not. Because we already know how the cause-effect relationship works. not using segwit/batch -&gt; more space use -&gt; higher fees.

At current CPU speeds, assuming a supercomputer that does 15 trillion hashes/second, a SHA-256 hash is cracked in about 0.60 billion billion years. Now let's try to assume the ultimate computer. It is still limited by [Bremermann's limit]( Assuming this ultimate computer is about the size of the earth, it still needs 2 minutes to crack a SHA256 hash. Should bitcoin switch to a 512-bit key instead, that goes up to 10^72 years. This however, does not factor in the possibility of quantum computing. Even though quantum computing is still some time away, there have already been designed algorithms that cannot be cracked by quantum computers.  
  
TL;DR: Even in the most absurd circumstances, switching up the algorithm does the trick.
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:11:34
I didn't say it would stabilize at 10K, I just said, given a constant adoption rate and constant supply, it would stabilize somewhere.
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:07:41
I see lightning as a great way to do low-cost transactions. Say anything under 100$. The fees are still secure as all you have to do to get your money is close the channel. I like the benefit off it being instant seeing as this can be a deciding factor in off-line purchase adoption.  
  
If you feel like any of this is incorrect, feel free to reply. I'd love to learn more.

Fees are actually quite low right now. Very low transaction fees (10 sato/byte) can already get confirmed in the next block (~10 mins) if you're a bit lucky.   
Edit: Since I see you're asking a lot of questions in this thread, I'll add a bit of info. LN has instant confirmations because it works differently, so when that comes around it'll be exciting.

It has nothing to do with samples, nor coinbase. It's simple math. math doesn't need samples. Without using segwit and batching, you just need more space.

You don't need a channel for every store. As long as the channel connects in some way to the store. Two, maybe three channels should be enough to access the entire network.
