So if someone was on trial for murder as well as the theft of a candybar, you think it would be dumb if the murder case was dropped and they got a life sentence for the candybar theft? In the end it's all the same.

Okay then, what about if the drug seller ends up being an undercover DEA agent that now has the address or other means of finding someone that's buying illegal substances? Good job, you just gave your location to law enforcement while also admitting to buying illegal drugs.

What? How the hell are hard drugs going to get through the postal service without them finding them and arresting you at your address printed on the box? What happens when they look in your box and see 2 pounds of coke in a box with your home address on it?

How do the transactions take place then? If you're buying drugs, then how do you get your drugs if it's all online? It's not like they can email you drugs and then you print them. There has to be *some* point of physical contact, which is where someone could get killed.

Yeah an address is gonna be required for you to actually get your stuff. *That's* the physical part. They now have an address that they can find you at and raid your house and kill you, or they know where you're gonna be to pick up your drugs, so they could just stake out that address and then kill the guy that gets the package.

I just find it hard to believe that people would actually be dumb enough to ship illegal substances in a package with their name and address on it... It's like if someone said, "How am I going to get these guns and bags of meth I got while in Mexico back to my house? I know I'll just bring them on the plane with me!" Like, good fucking luck.

If some dude is totally okay with selling illegal drugs, then the probably don't have many hangups with doing other illegal activities like murder...

Well if they're like super hard drugs and super illegal drugs then yeah they're not so far apart. I'm just saying, someone selling hard drugs isn't going to have the straightest moral compass.

Also, now some guy has my address and can come and slit my throat at night. Cool.

Not sure what the problem is with that phrase...? And I haven't been 12 for 20 years. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 04:21:30


Wow are you sure? That's messed up. There's like no security whatsoever? What if someone mailed a bomb? Also wouldn't the shipping label have your address and their address on it? You can't just fake an address... they won't ship it if the address isn't real.

1. With eBay you're not buying things from drug lords
2. If you don't give your actual address, then there's no way you're going to get your package...
