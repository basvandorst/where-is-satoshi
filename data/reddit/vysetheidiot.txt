I mean I attacked your point first and then slammed it home with an insult. 
Dreamers are legal residents of this country brought here illegally at a young age and this is the only home they've ever known. You really support kicking them out?

Dems have made it clear they will start funding the wall if we pass DACA and CHIP.

Yup you’ve clearly have a great grasp of the situation! And what command of the English language too! It’s like reading Shakespeare.

o wait why banking  but not private photos? 
Isn't banking way more valuable and something we shouldn't do? 
I get that we need to and it makes life better but why is using online banking now something that we shouldn't do to protect ourselves while storing photos online is your fault if they get stolen. 
It's a double standard and weird. 
You rarely hear identity left victims being blamed when they shop online?

It's still victim blaming. She had the reasonable expectation that her photos were private there.

I fully expect my email to be private. Same as my house. Yes it could be broken into but it shouldn't 
@_date: 2014-09-01 09:28:36
Listen I get its not but it should be. Just like my house

Maybe here but this is a highly tech literate group. Among the general population I would imagine the vast majority would say it's safe

Wait but your not giving it away for free. Your talking about giving it away for free. Big difference!
