It wasn't supposed to be either. I noticed the correlation and found it amusing. Also, I figured everyone could use some cheering up in the face of potential financial loss. I am sorry, if I offended you.

Hehe. I gotta say though, I think it doesn't even look that bad on the big picture!

It's starting to get really warm, but there is supposed to be a lot of rain, too.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:20:58
Definitely not the case.

I'm at like ฿0.029 right now. Better than nothing, don't you think?

I invested a small amount when it was at the peak and then tried to stay calm throughout the crash. I lost a little bit, but it's nothing I couldn't afford to lose.
I really hope that the exchange rate will stabilize in the near future. I think Bitcoin has the potential to grow and and be very successful.

This was actually about a week ago. It went up to 4° (nice call) and then down to -2° within a few days. Now it's slowly getting warmer (6°).

Wow. Just WOW. I seriously don't know what to say.
I saw the post and was bored, so I went ahead and pasted my own code on top of the old one. I am by no means an expert with Photoshop (as you can see), but I think it's hilarious that The Verge ended up using my picture, instead of the original.
Well, this has been fun. Thanks to for pointing it out to me!

You guys ***obviously*** got it all wrong!
Here is the [original]( I even [enhanced]( it properly for you.

Interesting analysis. However, I do NOT recommend investing into Bitcoins based on future weather forecasts. And thank you for the tip, kind Sir!

Haha, that's fucking hilarious. They removed it though.
Edit: I just read through the comments on 'The Verge'. Haha, you just made my day. I'm amazed how an editor could write an article about this and end up using the *wrong* picture. Here's a [link]( to the original version of the article. Thanks for pointing it out, by the way.

No, please don't do that. I quote from my earlier comment:
