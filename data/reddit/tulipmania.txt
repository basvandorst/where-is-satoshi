However the pressure to pay off the investment is higher, and you have to keep getting more/faster/higher efficiency hardware to maintain revenue if you want to stay operating for more than 6 months.
The operating costs however are negligible at around $50-55k per month for power (miners + cooling), but rent is hard to know.

Even the first gen Avalons which have the worst efficiency still generate 9x their operating costs and will continue to generate more than operating costs until sometime around April or May assuming difficulty continues to double every month.

Only one problem with what you're saying: Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible. You can increase the money supply 10x by adding a decimal place, but only if a majority of the miners agree.

Take the hash of the previous block and utilize it as a FSM to select from different variations of various hash functions. You will not be able to fit all possible hash functions and variations on them in the current limits of existing top end FPGAs (roughly 2 million logic cells at a cost of 20-40k per chip) without reprogramming for each block which is prohibitively slow which means any theoretical speed gain is lost right from the start.
But that's irrelevant since the point is is that at a cost of **20-40k USD per chip**, ignoring the cost of the rest of the board, designing an FPGA miner to be future proofed against any change in PoW would never be able to turn a profit before it broke or cost more in electricity costs to run than it earns.

The work factor of scrypt only changes how much time each attempt takes this was of course as you stated off by a factor of 256. His passphrase parameters determine the maximum number of passphrases that must be searched.
The non-existent ASIC would be useless due to the different work factor, so we're really only talking about GPUs.
So a 1.125MH/s 7990 would become roughly 4.3KH/s, probably less if there's not enough memory and limiting parallelism, taking roughly 1609 years. Or the entire present Litecoin network about 4.7 years.

That quantity is pure supposition. He's making a tremendous assumption that because the extra-nonce is incrementing linearly that it belongs to the same miner.

The mistake he's making is assuming that difficulty adjustments happen on a fixed TIME based schedule instead of the reality of every 2016 blocks.
That false assumption made him make another false assumption that it was possible to instant-on a metric fcuktonne of ASICs at the beginning of each "two week" period and thereby mine a bunch of extra blocks before difficulty caught up.
That however never happened, and looking over any number of available sources shows that it didn't happen.

Assuming difficulty continues to double roughly every month we'll see:

* Existing BFL goes negative around April.
* KnC Jupiters in May.
* KnC Saturn, Mercury and Neptune in June.
* HashFast in July.
* Cointerra in July.

In a fixed quantity system the interest deflates the currency which increases the value of everyone's currency a tiny amount because the overall economy has expanded.

It's an arms race that's self-limiting, if they're believers and don't wish to harm themselves.
In theory no single entity would go beyond 51%, in practice they can spread across multiple pools in addition to solo. However as you hinted at, adding additional capacity only increases their capital and recurring costs for an increasingly smaller gain in revenue.

Loans would work as they do now, you pay back the original amount plus y% in the same currency, in this case BTC. Since accounts can't be seized or frozen, nearly all loans will be secured by collateral that can be liquidated in the event of default.

Just to give you some idea of what you're suggesting as a "solution" a current model FPGA that would be large enough to have some chance of "future proof" costs $20,000 - $44,000 per chip, in quantity, depending on options. And you still have to design a board around it and it's a BGA mounted chip so it's not DIY.

For someone to commit fraud with your CC they only need either A. steal it (noticeable) or B. copy the numbers+exp+ccv (trivial in comparison), then proceed to obtain stuff with it. When the fraud is discovered, the person who committed the fraud still has whatever they bought, you have your money, the merchant pays for it directly, and everyone else pays for it indirectly.
