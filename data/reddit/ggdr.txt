It says with 1.9 million computers they could make only about $2000 per day (compared to the 10 million dollars per year they make with click fraud). I doubt it's even worth it, considering it makes your malware more likely to be detected (100% CPU usage is a good warning that something is wrong).
Of course they are assuming every computer has a Pentium D from 2006 with no GPU, but still.

I just thought of something: online wallets and exchanges should allow logging in via Google, Microsoft or Facebook accounts.

Unplugging your hard drive and booting from a liveUSB would be equivalent to that (but probably a very big hassle if you have to do it often). You could keep your wallet in an USB drive with biometric protection (e.g. Ironkey F200).
In practice, just booting a secondary encrypted OS (preferably a minimalistic linux distro) probably eliminates 99% of malware risks anyway.

The way I see it, the main dangers that can lead to loss of bitcoins are:
* Loss of the wallet file
* Theft by roommates or other people (as in physically grabbing your computer, or a disk with a copy of your wallet, and sending the coins somewhere else)
* Malware gaining control of your bitcoin client
The first one can be mitigated by making backups (though this increases the risk of theft, since it means more copies of your wallet), and the second one can be prevented with encryption. But there's no easy way to prevent the third one. Current desktop OSs are just not secure for daily use. For starters, installing anything means giving it full access to the system (just one "yes" on an UAC dialog or entering your password once on Linux means your system could be compromised forever), and even unprivileged processes (including things like Firefox extensions) have access to your files. And second, they are absurdly complex, having hundreds of background services (as I write this there are 77 processes running in my computer) and dozens of update checkers running permanently, sending and receiving things from the internet continuously. The attack surface is very large, meaning that just one vulnerable or misconfigured application can be used to compromise the system.
A secondary minimal Linux system, OTOH is very secure, for a few reasons: simplicity (only the basic processes are running, nothing has messed with the default settings), greatly reduced probability of running rogue code (the only thing you install is the bitcoin client), is not running continuously, and lower adoption (even in bitcoin, most people use Windows, so there is less incentive to write linux malware). In addition, open-source software tends to have fewer vulnerabilities than propietary software such as Windows (since they are caught and corrected earlier).
While a virtual machine would also be safer than just running the client directly, it wouldn't protect you from some things, like keyloggers. Even if you think that risk is small, installing an OS on the real machine is only slightly harder than installing it in a VM.
I chose [L]ubuntu because it’s simple, has good hardware support, and popular. Being popular means most software comes pre-packaged for it, it's easier to find support, more likely to stay updated and probably less likely to have undiscovered vulnerabilities. It's true that there are other distributions that are significantly smaller, but I don't think that's too important. 4.5 GB is very little compared to the sizes of current hard disks (&gt;500GB). For the bitcoin client, I wanted to use one that uses deterministic addresses (does not require a backup after every transaction), which means either Armory or Electrum.

If it were any other bank, they'd use a custom-made bitcoin client in COBOL running on an IBM System/370 mainframe, that the bank administration spent $5.5M to develop (3 months later an anonymous blogger discovers they do all input validation in client-side Javascript).
Or worse, [Access and VBA]( to manage the transactions.
This bank seems a little more competent with technology though so they'll hopefully do it better.

Bitcoin.de does exactly this. In order to withdraw your bitcoins you have to receive an SMS and enter the code there. I think to change the receiving phone number, you need to do a transaction from your specific bank account.
Though SMSs are not 100% trouble-free. I tried to activate my phone number on PayPal but I never receive any of the codes they send me. And I have no idea how secure the GSM network is.
I like the idea of whitelisted bitcoin addresses. If I have a secure (e.g. offline) wallet I should be able to withdraw my coins there without any extra verification. But maybe people would just set that pointing to their insecure wallet and get their bitcoins stolen from there?

 How to install Electrum in Ubuntu-based distros
1. Open a terminal. Run [the commands listed in Electrum's website](
        sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip
        sudo pip install 
    After it's finished, check your menu, there should be an "Electrum Bitcoin Wallet" icon under "Internet". You might want to copy the shortcut to your desktop (right click on it, don't drag it).
2. Launch Electrum. Create a new wallet. Write down the seed on a paper, this will be your "paper wallet", in case you ever forget your password or lose your files, so keep it in a safe place. You have to enter it again on the next page (you're supposed to write it, but you can just copy and paste it, shhh don't tell anyone). Accept whichever server it offers. Enter a secure password for encryption (see note below).
3. You'll probably want to make a digital backup of your wallet so you don't need to get the paper wallet if something happens to your Linux install. Since the "make backup" option of Electrum has been [broken for a while]( you have to do it manually: close Electrum, go to the folder ".electrum" in your home directory (it's hidden, to see it press Ctrl+H) and copy the file "electrum.dat" everywhere you can (USB drives, computers, online services...). You should also copy your receiving address from Electrum and save it together with that file, or at least mail it to yourself.
4. That's it!
 **Password strength**
Unlike Armory, Electrum does not use Scrypt, which means passwords will be a lot faster to brute force. Some sources seem to suggest cracking rigs can easily reach 30 billion AES attempts per second. If we assume 1 trillion attempts per second, an attacker could run through all 10-character passwords made of upper and lower case letters in just two days. And that's not counting dictionary attacks, common patterns, etc. which make most passwords easier to crack.
Therefore, if you use a single word it should be at least 12 characters, not limited to a small set of characters (such as lower case or upper case letters) and not a variation of any known word. I suggest using a passphrase instead. You can use [this generator]( or [this one]( The first one is stronger because it uses more base words (though they might be harder to remember). 5 words are probably enough.
Remember too that if you use the same password for several sites, it's very likely that one of them will be hacked and your password will end up on a password list.
And finally another possibility is to simply memorize the Electrum seed, and reuse it as the password. This is the safest option, since it's perfectly random and also doubles as a brain wallet. If you do this you don't have to backup your electrum.dat, since it doesn't contain any useful information.

I'm a bit tired of this "education system discourages thinking" meme. The education system (in many countries) can definitely be very bad, but not in a malicious way. I've never seen or experienced any teacher doing any activity that actively discourages thinking. Just lack of interest.
You make it sound like the librarian was thinking "damn children trying to learn more than the government approves of!" when it was most likely "if I let this girl get those books, she'll probably rip a page off or come crying because she doesn't understand a word, and I'll have to stay here for an extra 20 minutes".

The real world is a very complex thing. Even the simplest ideas will have hundreds or thousands of external factors messing with things.
When people say "in theory...", what they usually mean is "if we take a grossly simplified model ignore all external factors...", which of course tends to fail most times, but if they took an actual representation of the world (which is much more complicated that what humans can do today) there's no reason why theory and practice would diverge.
In fact that's what most science fields do: they build models of things and try to make them as accurate as possible.

Well you need some form of encryption if you want to store the wallet in your disk, or you could not store the wallet in your disk and instead recreate it from the seed every time you need it. And if you have the wallet encrypted, you might as well copy it to a few places so you don't have to enter it if you lose it.
It's the same thing as with Armory really, an encrypted wallet on the disk and an unencrypted backup on paper, only in a friendlier format.

I don't think it's possible to phish people by email. Well, it is, the same way you can phish by web (registering a similar domain) but, while you can (not always) spoof the sender from an email, there's no way to read the answer. So if you send your password to support-dude-435 it *should* stay relatively safe.
The main reasons email should be treated as something unsafe are:  
- It's an old standard poorly fit for today's world (with things like spoofing the sender being trivial)  
- It's usually not treated as confidential, which means there's a good chance it will end up in an unencrypted backup, or transmitted through untrusted servers, or given to third parties, etc.

 How to install Armory in Ubuntu-based distros
1. Download the [Ubuntu/Debian package for Armory]( Make sure the download page is secure (the padlock in the address bar). Click on the downloaded file. It should open with "Package Installer". Click on "Install Package", it will download all dependencies and install Armory. After it's finished, check your menu, there should be an "Armory" icon under "Internet". You might want to copy the shortcut to your desktop (right click on it, don't drag it).  
2. Launch Armory. Accept the license agreement (License agreements? In *my* open source software? It's more likely than you think) and create a new wallet. Enter a secure password for encryption. Since the possibility of brute force is real here, it should not be anything under 8 characters, or based off a word or a pattern. Also remember you should never reuse the same password for every site, since some of those sites will be hacked. If you want to be sure, use a random 5 word passphrase. Here are two generators: [[1]]( [[2]](  
25. You will be offered to print a paper wallet backup. If you don't have a printer at hand or don't want to install it here, you can write it down by hand or print it to a PDF to print it later. However, read the note below to avoid leaving copies of your unencrypted wallet. Make sure you store your paper wallet in a safe place.  
3. Click on Wallet Properties, then on "Make Digital Backup". Save the file somewhere. This is the most important file. You will need to make several copies of it, the more the better (don't worry it's encrypted). You probably have at least 3 thumb drives, 2 computers and 5 online services where you could copy it, so do that. You can do it after you finish installing Armory, but DON'T FORGET ABOUT IT. You'll also want to click on "Receive Bitcoins" and save the resulting address to a text file, and keep this file together with the other one. This way you'll be able to send coins there easily.  
2. Go back to the main Armory window. Click on "Auto-Install Bitcoin" on the lower panel, then on "Install Bitcoin PPA". If there isn't any problem, Armory should install Bitcoin-Qt and start downloading the block chain automatically.  
1. That's it! There will be a "Bitcoin" icon in your menu, under the "Office" category, but don't use that one, always use Armory. Bitcoin-Qt uses a different wallet that has not been backed up or encrypted. Once the block chain has been downloaded, you'll be able to see your balance and send bitcoins to any address. If you already have Bitcoin-Qt installed and synchronized on your system, you can skip the download by copying or moving the data from there, see note below.
 **How to avoid leaving copies of your unencrypted paper wallet**
Deleting or moving a file does not actually delete it from the hard disk. This means if you save your paper wallet to a PDF file in an USB drive and just delete it after printing, someone who found that drive could just run a file recovery program and snoop through the results, and find your bitcoins there just waiting to be taken. To avoid this, you need to do two things:  
1. Don't move the file between disks. Just save it directly to an USB drive or a local partition, and print it from there.
2. When you are done printing, boot back to Lubuntu, open a terminal and type "`shred -u `" followed by the path to the file. You can get this easily by dragging the file to the terminal.
Sadly this still does not completely prevent your wallet from being stored somewhere. It's possible that some OSs or printers save printed documents in cache. As a precaution, you should do it from a safe computer and printer.
 **How to copy the block chain**
Make sure neither Armory nor Bitcoin-Qt are running. Navigate to the folder with the current install of Bitcoin-Qt. In Windows by default it's *[drive]/Users/[username]/AppData/Roaming/Bitcoin/*, in Linux */home/[username]/.bitcoin*. Copy the folders "blocks" and "chainstate" to the directory *~/.bitcoin* (if you can't see it, press Ctrl+H). That's it, just launch Armory to check if it worked.

 How to install Lubuntu to an USB drive
The drive you install FROM and the drive you install TO can't be the same drive, so you either need two USB drives or one blank CD and one USB drive.
001. Download the [Lubuntu installer image]( You can burn it to a CD, but most people just use a USB flash drive. The recommended way to do that is [UNetbootin]( which should work for Windows, OS X and Linux.
002. Boot into the USB drive. This is usually done by holding a key during boot, like Esc or F8. On the menu, choose either install *lubuntu directly* or *try lubuntu live* and run the installer from there.
003. Before clicking "continue" on the installer, connect the USB drive you are installing to. Continue installing, select the option to download updates while installing, but don't select the option to install 3rd party software (Flash is way too insecure), then continue to the page that says "Installation type". Select "something else". On the next page you will see a list of devices each with one or more partitions. Find the one you are installing to. You can tell by the size, if you're not sure (on live mode) you can launch GParted to see all the devices in more detail. Your internal hard disk is usually /dev/sda.
233. If the drive has just a single FAT32 or NTFS partition, like most drives do, you can simply resize it to a smaller size. Windows seems to look only at the first partition of a drive, so if you do this it will still look like a standard flash drive with less space. If you don't want that just delete all the partitions. Select the free space at the end of the drive and make a new partition. Select "/" as the mount point, leave the other options as they are (use the full space, primary or logical doesn't matter, ext4 is fine). On the list below, "Device for boot loader installation", choose the same device (for example /dev/sdg, but NOT /dev/sdg1). It will complain about no swap space, but I don't think it's that necessary nowadays.
012. Enter an username and a password, the password doesn't need to be very secure, but don't use 123456 either. It's mostly to keep casual snoopers away. Check the "encrypt my home folder" option too, if anything it's an extra layer of security. Wait until the installation is done, shut down the system. Take out the USB drive or CD you installed FROM and boot into the other USB drive like you did in step 2. If nothing went wrong you should see the GRUB menu offering a few OS choices (though the other options probably won't work in other computers) and launching Lubuntu by default.
213. Reboot the computer WITHOUT pressing anything to make sure it still works the way it did before.

@_date: 2013-04-16 14:49:47
Yes, probably. But there's a much deeper problem.
The average computer today is just not secure. I've seen far too many people with adware covering half their screens and redirecting their google searches. Botnets routinely get millions of computers under their control. There are flash vulnerabilities, java vulnerabilities, and dozens more of attack vectors (and ultimately it only takes a single click, "Yes" on the UAC pop up, to get complete access to a computer, and users have been trained to click that 99% of the time). And if bitcoins become popular, you can expect bitcoin-stealer software to become popular too (and web wallets don't solve that).
It's not really _hard_ to secure a computer if you know how, it's just that if so many users have problems telling the difference between Google and Internet Explorer, you can't expect them to be able to tell between a "good" program installer and an "evil" one.
Ultimately, I think the only good solution is a hardware wallet. The private key could stay in there and never have to leave the device (it could have a simple screen to display outgoing transactions and a button to confirm them). That's why we invented smartcards. Admittedly I don't know much about the cryptographic bitcoin internals but it seems like it should be possible.

Case in point: this link to a "ripple sucks" thread has 114 upvotes, whereas the "here is a detailed explanation how ripple works that addresses most criticisms" post it's directly responding to has 11. And for some reason there are plenty of downvoted comments in here that don't really say anything bad other than "I don't think ripple sucks" (but the "I think ripple sucks" get upvotes - is this what the up/downvote system was meant for?).
So far, the only real criticisms I've seen are:
* It's not yet completely open source. OK, let's wait until they release the code, if they don't, it's a scam. Can't get more unambiguous than that.
* They hold virtually all the XRPs. This can clearly be a problem if XRPs become a valuable currency, but AFAIU they're just meant to be "anti-DDOS protection".
And even if they did become a "real" currency, the only problem with that would be possible market manipulation by OpenCoin, not them making money. I mean, Satoshi allegedly has $100M of bitcoins, and other early adopters probably have more.

 How to install Lubuntu to your hard disk
001. Download the [Lubuntu installer image]( You can burn it to a CD, but most people just use a USB flash drive. The recommended way to do that is [UNetbootin]( which should work for Windows, OS X and Linux.
002. Boot into the USB drive. This is usually done by holding a key during boot, like Esc or F8. On the menu, choose either *install lubuntu directly* or *try lubuntu live* and run the installer from there. Install the system. There should be an "install alongside Windows" option. Lubuntu takes 4.5GB, so add 25GB if you're installing Armory and 3GB if you're installing Litecoin (and it's always good to have some extra room, resizing partitions is a mess). Select the option to download updates while installing, but don't select the option to install 3rd party software (Flash is way too insecure). Enter an username and a password, the password doesn't need to be very secure, but don't use 123456 either. It's mostly to keep casual snoopers away. Check the "encrypt my home folder" option too, if anything it's an extra layer of security.
836. When the installation is done, reboot the system. You will see the GRUB2 menu listing several OS choices with a timer set for 10s. Look for your main OS and note down the exact string, for example, "`Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)`". You will need it in the next step. Start Lubuntu.
069. Since you're not going to use this as your main system, you need to set GRUB to launch Windows (or your other OS) by default.
    1. Open a terminal, enter "`sudo leafpad /etc/default/grub`".
    1. Find the option `GRUB_DEFAULT` and change it to the string you saw before, in double quotes. For example: `GRUB_DEFAULT="Windows 7 (loader) (on /dev/sda1)"`. You have to write it exactly as it appears on the boot screen because Grub sucks.
    1. Find the option `GRUB_TIMEOUT` and change it to something more sensible (between 1 and 3). For example `GRUB_TIMEOUT=2`
    1. Save the file, close the editor and run "`sudo update-grub`". Reboot the computer to check that the changes worked.
1. That's all

This simply means that no programmer can use the Android cryptographic APIs ever again (because it will affect users who can't update) and will have to supply their own.

That's the problem of online security. Google could easily say "from now on, people can enter their account if and only if they know the password and authenticator code", and it would be easy to implement, but that's not what most people want. What people want is "only I can enter my account". So the password and the 2FA become just another thing Google (and other sites) can use to tell if it's you. Thus we have security questions, secondary emails, phone numbers, IP geolocation restrictions, and those questionnaires you can fill if you really lose your password and other recovery options.
In the end it's entirely up to them to decide if you're really you or not.

True, that's a risk. But I think it's very unlikely, most bitcoin-stealing malware will just look for a wallet or a bitcoin process in your system, not look for other partitions and then load an ext4 driver (if it's for Windows) to read them. Unless this method becomes too popular, of course.
Also, an attacker could still replace the system loader (that asks for your password) and make it store the password somewhere, then read it. The only way to prevent that is secure boot, and there's absolutely no easy way to set that up for a Linux distro.
Edit: or you could use a USB drive. That works too.

Keep them secure. DO NOT NEVER EVER keep them (or dollars) in any exchange for longer than necessary. If it's a very large sum you should buy a secondary netbook and keep the keys there (and a safe, and keep a paper backup of the keys there).

No, no, no, no. First, OpenCoin is the name of the company, Ripple is the name of the system, and "ripples" or XRPs are the internal currency.
Ripples are not supposed to be actually used as a currency, they are used to pay the transaction fees (at least that's what I understood from the wiki). So as long as everyone has a few thousand, the system should work.
And the ripple client IS open source, the server is supposedly getting open sourced in the future. It's still in early beta stage. If it really is bad, people just won't adopt it. You don't see people using novocoins or terracoins right?

Keeping the install in a USB drive is a good idea. The downside is, of course, that you need to plug it any time you want to use it.
I don't think it needs to be offline though. I've never heard of up to date Ubuntu systems being compromised remotely. And to use online Armory on it you'd need to store the block chain, which means either a large stick (&gt;16GB) or storing it in the hard disk.

For this quantity of money there is only one valid choice: buy a secondary laptop, install Ubuntu in it, install Bitcoin-Qt in it, print the private keys (or better yet, write them down manually) and store several copies in a safe, encrypt the wallet with a secure passphrase (try [this]( make a few more backups, then transfer most of your funds there and don't touch it until you need them.
I'd say most of the risk comes from bugs in software (look what happened to Android users), so try sticking to old and proven software whenever you can. That's why you shouldn't use Electrum (or other things like fancy hardware wallets) until it's been working for more years.

How does this work? The sender just signs a transaction and sends it to the receiver, so it can broadcast it later to the network?
Sounds like it could work as long as the receiver has internet, otherwise it would be very easy to sign a fake transaction (from an address with no funds).
