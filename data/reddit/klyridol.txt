Yes I'm checking it right now, I'm gonna try to do this as soon as possible.
Edit: It's gonna take some time as I don't really know how works MD5 hash, if someone passes here and could give me the big picture it would be great !

Compact mode is now available.

No problem for posting the source but it's my first app and I don't really know how to do it ?
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:24:32
Ok, I'll try to add this for next update.

I've added a compact mode and CaVirtex exchange + tap to refresh.

Compact mode option is definitely gonna be in my top to do list for next update ! Thank you for your feedback.

I'm glad you liked it, and thanks for the 5 stars ! (I must say I was kinda disappointed when I read the first line of your comment hahaha)
I'm taking your suggestions for the next update, I really really like the idea of the Bitcoin logo in the middle of the refresh circle. For the color I chosed blue as I thought that's the color that "everyone like", but if I have other feedback in that way, I'll change it for orange.

Hey! Well that is a constructive feedback! I keep all these ideas, I surely will use some of them in the next updates. At start I did the widget for myself as I thought the others were kinda ugly on my homescreen, that's why I didn"t add all these "pro" features.
Thanks for your comment, very helpful.

Now you can chose your currency, hope you like it !
@_date: 2014-03-15 22:26:27
Ok, I'll add this exchange too.
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:45:53
