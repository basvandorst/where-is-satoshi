Sure, [High Res Colour Version Here](
Yes it's real :)  Pasted on the door to the right of the Shephard Fairey ['No Regulation' piece]( on Ebor Street, Shoreditch.
Will get some more shots tomorrow if I can, had to catch last train home so only had chance to get a few night shots yesterday.

Despite it looking like a gaggle of murderous mugshots, these people comprise of: Musicians, artists, entrepreneurs, a gardener, interior designer, teacher, a photographer, fashion designer and landlady - all of them are willing to start accepting bitcoin and some already are.  A couple of them are famous if you can spot them :p More to be revealed in my journal!  &lt;3

Yes, we had lots of people shouting "Go Bitcoin", and many confused looks. 
We'll be back out again today, so I'll keep you posted. :)

The B has 3 lines on top and bottom rather than 2 (I overestimated the size of the B when drawing the first line) - and also the 'to' in the title, I meant 'too'. :P
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:14:39
thank you for the internets :) 
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:17:06
Because he thought we were taking pictures of him. We ended up chatting about bitcoin and making him laugh.

I didn't post for the tips (I'm helping setup the exhibition in London and did this for fun), but many thanks for your kindness. Don't want people thinking I'm a scammer though, so here's a confirmation pic :D

Hey Guys, 
Just wanted to say thank you for all the love &amp; support. This has been an awesome journey so far! &lt;3 
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:14:08
thanks :) 
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:22:54
Beautiful. You should get her in touch with the guys at Fork The Banks, I hear they are always looking for artists! 
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:53:53
Well I'm sure that would go horribly wrong for Fork The Banks after the messages I have just received. Most certainly not all sugar coated and lovely like the one they/he posted publicly here.

I was homeless for 3 weeks. My boss's parents kindly took me in for a few weeks, without them I would have been stranded in London on the streets. 
Yes, I am now at my mother's home as I said in the video. I do not feel it is safe at all to be posting my location online, so thank you for potentially putting me in danger. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:26:34
This is bullshit. If it had any remorse or truth behind it you would have messaged me privately. You're being vindictive and trying to hide what you have done by trying to look like poor little men on the internet. 
Non-profit organisation??? "Once we get the funding in, we can use the money to go away for a while and Ingo can use it to pay off his hideous debt" - oh and twitter followers! 
You know the truth. You know what you did. You know what you're doing.
I was a total fool for believing you, but I am trying to do the right thing and give everybody those 4 Bitcoin back. 
@_date: 2015-09-20 06:30:50
I refuse to talk to you or any of your con-artists from Fork The Banks publicly. 
If you wish to be seen as the professional, lovely dovey, hippy organisation you're trying to mask yourselves behind, please contact me via my personal email address or phone number.
