Please correct me if I'm off here because I'm totally making this up based on my google law degree. Isn't the benefit of a global decentralized network that in most cases it is beyond the jurisdiction of a regulatory entity?  The only thing that can be regulated would be actors in the system.  So, regulatory bodies (banks, commissions, courts, magistrates, and governments in general) can regulate people and businesses within their jurisdiction, but regulation of crypto as a whole may prove to be a fruitless effort.  If a regulatory entity were to attempt to impose regulations and nothing changes, their authority is jeopardized and they risk not being able to maintain their authority on future issues.  I guess my question is --  aside from crime (where a regulatory entity does have legal authority within their geographical jurisdiction) what regulations are needed?

You are the broker.  Find an exchange you like and buy your coins.

Too bad for visa.  Crypto is a threat to their business.

Thanks!  I thought that was the case but I wasn’t sure. I know that is common on stocks and funds but I didn’t know that exchanges were allowing leveraged transactions to regular accounts on crypto.  Seems like a cool way to get hosed if you make bad decisions haha.
