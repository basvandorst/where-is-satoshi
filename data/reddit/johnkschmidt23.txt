Does anyone have suggestions on ways to help with a relatively large capital gains tax bill? I sold a fair amount of my holdings back in February and as a result have a decent capital gains tax liability, but obviously would like to avoid this as much as possible. 
I came across this blog post the other day at it seemed interesting, anyone know anything about this program? Seems like its a part of the new tax bill but I'm not sure if this is a good option compared to something else that may be out there.
