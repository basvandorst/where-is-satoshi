Had to google - doxing. If I understood it right I think they won’t publish personal date of Satoshi. Whey want to hire few investigative agencies to make them found out there all BTC started from and to make sure there is nobody wanting to bring chaos afterwards by selling those mio bitcoins which  are kept at that wallet of creator(s) 
I don’t have any knowledge or so , but it seems very plausible that it is to weird to hold that amount of something what was made to decentralize it. 
I hope it makes since what I write here lol 
Don’t judge me hard I’m only a enthusiast with a little English language skills by now.

Guys if you are looking for an empty wallet just ask me :P

That’s a point I’m telling people ! I accept meaning from anybody but not banking systems or people from there. They simple don’t care and try to get profit of every position. Just skip them and let’s create jobs for bitcoin and so on. 
Gonna work for bitcoin :P 
That’s the message which should be spread around the web !!

Guys chill. Keep calm 
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:11:48
Sorry. I meant how else to explain that buy order of over 90mio $ 
@_date: 2018-08-07 13:19:02
I actually  simple don’t understand why do you pay that much attention on thinks people say from banking system. Then surely don’t like the idea to pass banks and all those institutions. So they try to get us trust them by telling something what we actually don’t understand and then dump it. IMHO. 
2. I’d like to see more negative news so get rid of profiteers who don’t even care about privacy of data and decentralization. It would only make me buy more BTC actually. 
I’m improving my English slowly but understandable, hopefully haha 
Peace guys

[find Satoshi]( 
Satoshi needs to be found. And it is not just a trite curiosity.
Now the market is on a fragile balance; for the further development of cryptocurrency, we need to know who created crypto and why. Was it really an enthusiast who gave the world an independent currency or was it a group of people pursuing scientific or purely selfish purposes? Or perhaps Bitcoin is an invention of a large company or a IT giant that decided to take a new direction? Can Bitcoin be the state invention, created with the purpose to control all transactions? There are many assumptions as to who might be behind this, but neither theory has been confirmed.

Amazing. Annoyed of some “super smart” people who entered by 20k and also of holders which handle like last pieces of ****
It’s made to use and to get his value by itself with the time. Most important to USE! Buy and sell them to your friends without trying to make profit from them. If you really support Blockchain/ Bitcoin then show the people around you the right way to use it !!

Trying to make an announcement of anything what gets close to BtC or even just logo for an exchange. 
Hope this market falls down to 1$ /BTC so we can start it again. Make this  BtC holders poor ;) BtC is almost dead at this stage. The holders need to share more and not try to become new Rotschilds gg
