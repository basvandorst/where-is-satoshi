Hmmm... So using the Coinbase app will now allow Google to have a record of all your Coinbase transactions. But then again they already do if you're using Gmail for your Coinbase login.

Apparently there was the need. In the future always backup your keys/seed BEFORE sending bitcoin to any wallet. It sounds like you uninstalled and reinstalled because it is asking you for a seed. If not just go to Settings, Backup, Export Wallet Master Key. Then write them down on paper.

Localbitcoins.com or Mycelium for Android. It might only take you an hour or two find a local trader who will meet you in person.

It seems inevitable that internet-of-things devices will collect bitcoin. But it is a bad idea to allow these devices to have the private keys. Ripe for hacking if they do. The private keys should be controlled somewhere else, letting the device write the transaction and having the owner of the device sign it.

When Morgan buys his 1 bitcoin they discuss the fee and say it was only 0.6 cents. The seller was using Mycelium and at the time of filming that wallet set the fee at 0.0001 which was about 6 cents at the time.
