Just letting you know that site wants your SS number and also bank account information. I didn't finish the setup but it gave me a wallet ID anyways. I will probably cancel. I am not looking at this point to provide that level of private info as I have no idea what I am doing and BitCoin could easily give out that info without me knowing or get hacked. I am looking right now to create a wallet ID with nothing more than an email address. I don't want any of my personal info tied to something I am just learning that could burn me if I click the wrong thing.

I am new to BitCoin so please forgive me if this is the wrong section for beginners. I looked at Reddit Bitcoin for Beginners and no one has posted for months, and I was looking for active info. I would like to start taking BitCoin and other Cryptos. I run a website that does remote work for customers like removing viruses, server cleanup, and I have a PAYPAL icon on the site, and PAYPAL made it very easy. You can click on my hourly rate, and just add the numbers of hours you want, and its calculates the charge, and you use a credit card. Fees are super high, like 10&amp; from PayPal. I would like to setup an easy way for people to Pay in Bitcoins also, but am unsure how to start. Do i use Coinbase, or Bitpay? Seems like they pop up first when looking. Also, I want to be able to export the Bitcoins to a hard wallet, as everyone tells me thats the only way to go. In otherwords, at some point I want to cash out my coins and get USA cash, and hopefully do this anonymously, and be able to take the hard wallet "thumb drive" say to Athena and get cash immediately. They have ATMS here locally.  I don't want to have to deal with setup like Paypal with having to give them my bank account and so forth right now as I am just learning, and security is paramount.
