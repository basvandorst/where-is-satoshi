Crypto is the new plague. This isnt a fad. This is something that makes sense worldwide regardless of language, religious, or cultural differences.

@_date: 2018-09-19 19:53:18
Haha ya 100%. I never sold w.e I had cause I havent bothered to figure out how to convert it to fiat. I'm still subscribed to this subreddit and theres like 0 criticism of bitcoin on here. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:43:44
Going to buy the most at once i ever have. Yolo
@_date: 2017-12-29 05:18:15

Ya these crypto subs are def looking just like and attempts at pumps. But fool us once... I do hope crypto stays around to help those in countries with fucked up currency's. But here in Canada I learned my lesson that the whales were just tooling with us
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:21:54
Ya I totally feel like a sucker putting in 5k last year against  family advice only for it to plunge to like maybe 1.5k now tops. Now I just dont discuss crypto and hope they dont either :( but like I said I enjoy seeing it help Venezuelans and others in their hard times.

Ya the whales have shit on crypto and that shit is gonna be stinking for years. The mainstream will now be very reluctant to put money into crypto after this. I wish it wasn't dropping so quick because people in Venezuela and other countries really do have use for bitcoin and such at the moment 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:18:13
Buuuut but but *they* said it will be like 100k in 2020!! Fuck i dont even know how to withdraq my funds or i would have long ago :( 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:07:29
Yaaaaa...i put in abuncha $ hoping it would pay off. Even bought into the hype that bitcoin would be a major player in currency. Naaah since ive bought it therea not really any use for it. Like wtf am i gonna buy with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:08:28
Soon it will be forever.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:23:36
Dont put anymore in. Ive been hodling since i bought in November. Ive learned theres no use for bitcoin really :( i hope it goes up but im starting to think my holdings will go down to 0.
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:08:02
Lmao worst chart ahhahahaha
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:22:39
I'm still hodling but only because I'm too lazy to figure out how to cash out this fucked up shit. Fuck you crypto I believed you. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 01:05:39
This chart is bogus. Hahahahahahaha
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:34:26
I bought in 2012. A decent amount. I could buy your mother if I wanted to.

@_date: 2017-11-07 04:06:46
Nah, theyve created a great vehicle for the future of currency and other companies arent going to go crawl in a hole cause 1 homie fucked up their own shit. In 10years bitcoin could be a o yeah i remember them.  And alts that havent been created yet could be top dawgs. Lets hope bitcoin stays the og n keeps at the top of the crypto market
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:09:18

Bitcoin hit the mainstream, the mainstream saw bitcoin is unregulated so it shows no mercy. Bitcoin had its chance with the mainstream. I really doubt your average joe is gonna put money into that hole ever again
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:30:30
