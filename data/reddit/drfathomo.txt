It's not *just* hopes and dreams, I'm sure some people are also masturbating.
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:31:24
Why would there be another bubble?  Without MtGox restricting withdrawals and manipulating the price, there's no reason for the price to surge.  Everyone has heard of Bitcoin by now.  If consumers aren't buying it, it's because they don't want it.
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:56:18


Ding ding.
@_date: 2014-12-29 16:37:42
If they were, the price would be increasing, not decreasing.
@_date: 2014-12-28 14:00:25
Of course.  It's a serious and nearly inevitable problem.  But most people here don't care about long term problems or consequences, they just want to get rich quick.
@_date: 2014-12-23 01:25:12
Heretic!  Everyone knows that the world simply does not know about Bitcoin yet and those tiny few that do simply do not understand it!  Once the infidels are converted to our civilized ways of economy-destroying deflation and no chargebacks, they will thank us.

Merchant adoption doesn't mean anyone is actually using it.
@_date: 2014-12-23 06:33:44
This is evidence that adoption is not limited by people not knowing about it.  Everyone has heard of Bitcoin by now, most people are smart enough to see why it doesn't work.  (Hint:  it's all the libertarian stuff in there.)

If you want genuine debate, what could be better than a subreddit with nothing but large Bitcoin stakeholders telling each other how awesome they are?
@_date: 2014-12-25 17:55:23
You mean like Visa's incentive to run a fast, fully insured payment network?  Or are incentives only ok when they're Bitcoin incentives?
@_date: 2014-12-28 03:42:45
Bitcoin is far less fair in its current state than fiat.  Widespread adoption would cause orders of magnitude more inequality and suffering than exists currently.  That's what you're supporting.
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:01:06

No, Bitcoin is easy to use. You must have done something wrong.
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:52:31
If you don't spend Bitcoin, why would anyone else?  Sure, you can create artificial scarcity by refusing to use it, but that will only take you so far.  Ultimately a currency that no one uses has no value.
@_date: 2014-12-22 16:10:18
99.999% of consumers prefer it that way.
@_date: 2014-12-24 16:29:32
So neither works for microtransactions, what's your point?  This is why centralized services like Changetip emerge:  centralization is more efficient than person to person for stuff like this.
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:47:10
How about:  "when I buy with my credit card, I get an interest-free loan for a month, 2% cash back and full liability protection.  When I buy with Bitcoin I have to pay a bunch of fees to get it, protect it like Smeagol's precious to keep it from getting stolen and then have awkward conversations with whichever neckbeard at the one store that takes it is in charge of Bitcoin."

Brilliant counterargument, sir!  Yes, people are going to abandon their credit cards and adopt Bitcoin in droves because for small purchases there is a lower risk of being ripped off.  /s
@_date: 2014-12-17 05:27:27
Most Bitcoiners don't give a shit if you actually use Bitcoin or not. They just want their holdings to be worth more.

None of that will do anything without an expanding customer base.  And it's hard to argue that people haven't already been exposed to Bitcoin as a payment option, between Newegg, Dell and Microsoft.  If they were buying in, the price would already be going up.
@_date: 2014-12-22 21:32:15
Pay more for more, you mean.  And yes, nearly everybody would rather pay 2% higher prices than bear that risk themselves.  Which is why prices aren't going up no matter how much merchant adoption there is:  people prefer credit cards.  Even if you think they shouldn't.
@_date: 2014-12-28 03:20:28
You're supporting a system that, if your ultimate goal is successful, will lead to widespread inequality and suffering.  Lucky for people with a conscience, your ultimate goal is laughable, but it's worth pointing out what you're really trying to accomplish in the service of making easy money doing nothing.
@_date: 2014-12-28 18:14:50
Adoption is not going to happen.  Why would you think new people are going to spend Bitcoin when its biggest proponents don't spend it?

That price drop?  That was your money going into the pockets of Chinese ASIC farmers.  Transaction networks cost money to run, you're going to pay for it one way or another.
And don't spend the money you need to live on Bitcoin.  That's awful.  :(
@_date: 2014-12-23 04:40:37
If you really want to give them a tip, leave a copy of The Watchtower in their jar.  Eternal salvation is worth a lot more than mere money.
@_date: 2014-12-21 19:51:15
Yes, losing your actual money is not nearly as bad as losing the 16 digit number the credit card company gave you.  Even if they give you a new one and pay for any losses you incurred, that's a scar that doesn't heal.

Anyone transferring billions of dollars around the world probably doesn't care so much about bank fees.  Certainly not enough to risk getting robbed by exchanges or losing the whole thing to hackers.

@_date: 2014-12-22 02:41:03
Unless the fact that it offers no consumer protections means people stick with their credit cards.  Then all the merchant adoption in the world won't pump up the price.

Almost no one on this sub believes this.  Most people are here to make USD, not because they are happy with Bitcoin as it is.  Watch which articles get upvoted to the front page, nearly every one is "big news that means the Bitcoin price is about to skyrocket!!"

Bitcoin is built on a solid foundation of analogies. If something bad happens to Bitcoin, you just have to find something bad that happened to fiat or credit cards or Western Union or Iowa and boom:  problem solved.

Wait, are you saying that people don't spend their money if stuff just keeps getting cheaper with time?  Interesting...

None of Lehman Brothers' customers lost a cent from their brokerage accounts.  Their shareholders lost money, obviously, but that's part of the risk of investment.
And regulation had everything to do with it.  The financial services industry was *and still is* insufficiently regulated.  The whole purpose of regulation is to keep large institutions from harming society as a whole by doing stupid, selfish things.  
@_date: 2015-01-09 23:22:37
The OP is right. No one should ever be the least bit skeptical or suspicious when a Bitcoin exchange abruptly goes dark after a reported hack. Considering anything but the best possible outcome is foolish. Have a little faith, people!

This is true when you have a liquid, competitive market.  Not true at all when one exchange effectively sets the price and lies to people about both volume and source of transactions, i.e. MtGox.  It takes time for the market to unwind a price based on lies, though, which I suspect is what we're continuing to see now.

Why would they?  To woo the tiny, tiny fraction of customers who want to pay in Bitcoin, a business would have to risk alienating all their other customers by making them feel like they're not being offered a discount that others are getting.

Everything Bitcoin does costs Western Union *zero* dollars.  Nothing.  It's free.  All the costs come from the part Bitcoin doesn't do:  storefronts, staff, compliance with local laws, etc.  
Pretending you "just" have to get people all over the world to accept Bitcoin in lieu of their local currency is delusional.  If that were possible, why wouldn't they already accept something widespread and universally valuable, like USD?  Supplanting local currencies is not a small thing.

@_date: 2015-01-17 20:01:04
Sounds like you've got it all figured out, then.  People currently using Western Union can just switch over to Bitcoin and spend it wherever they live.  It sounds so simple when you put it like that, you'd think everyone would already be using it.

Bitcoin maintains fiat banking infrastructure?  You sure about that?
Bitcoin provides a decentralized public ledger for tracking ownership and transfer of money.  Western Union doesn't need or want a decentralized public ledger, they want a centralized private ledger.  A company maintaining a centralized ledger has little to no significant cost associated with it compared with all their other costs.

Do you actually think any of this stuff through for more like like two seconds before blurting it out on the Internet?  Most people aren't homeless ninjas, stealthily moving from place to place with just their possessions on their backs.  If you live in a country, you most likely have possessions and a job, maybe a house, some kids.  Refuse to pay your taxes and the government will take some or all of those things from you.  Sure, if you're willing to sit in jail, you can keep them from taking your Bitcoins, but most people value their time and freedom more than that.

Don't try to catch a falling knife.  If you really want to buy more Bitcoin (oy), wait and see what a few more weeks does to the price.  If it goes down to $150, wouldn't you rather buy in at that point than $270?
