Thank you for the reply, but this is to transfer Chilean pesos to € and not the other way around, am more into sending bitcoins (bought in €) to a Chilean bitcoin market (to withdrawn in Chilean pesos)

Indeed, thank you very much! Just updated the post with the transaction ID.
Yes they recommend always 0.0001 btc as a fee, and that's what I did, but right now what concerns me is this "double spend" thing, I don't even really understand how could this happen

Completely agreed, here in Scandinavia top level education is: FOR FREE :)

So, how many btc should I add as a fee for a 2btc transaction , for example? Something around 500 bytes?

I am living the exactly same drama right now, and I am also wondering when it will fail so the btc will return to my wallet so I can retry :(

Thank you! What would you recommend as a fee for such transaction? It is just strange that my transaction is stuck for like 10 hours now...
@_date: 2015-12-12 21:07:22
However, I also have a double spend going on here 
@_date: 2015-12-12 13:29:30
Sorry for the ingenuity, but then it is based on what exactly?
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:58:43
I buy and sell everyday! 
@_date: 2016-01-15 17:07:38
Could take even more 
@_date: 2015-11-05 00:17:12
Praying for €460 hopefully 
@_date: 2015-11-04 23:05:17
Thank you for giving me hopes

In the past 3 days I think I've seen Kraken offline around 10 times. (Estonia)

Am living the same drama, I bought it at 445€ this morning and now am just here watching my bankruptcy HAHA

Don't you think that what would happen would be the exact opposite? Less rich and more poor and a worse health care?
@_date: 2015-11-13 06:55:11
Could you please develop your idea? Ps: I'm Estonian
