That’s the thing, only 3% of their coins (and the keys for them) are on a live server that could be compromised, and those 3% are insured by the fdic for up to $250,000 per person just like any bank account in America. Wtf are you going on about?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:52:09
It’s literally fdic insured lol

You’re right, but they are stored offline and therefore are far less susceptible to a hack than say, nicehash who just lost 70m the other day

Alright u/clocktease I’m sorry. You’ve got some good points. I shouldn’t have tossed away so readily
I do agree that a cold drive in a safe place is more secure. But I think coinbase may be the safest exchange all things considered, and might be safer than a phone or laptop with internet connection.

That’s a rather arbitrary thing to say, sure Mtgox was big back then but other than that they have many differences

Gox is very different to me. It was based in Japan, more centralized, had less founders, and wasn’t federally involved.. not to mention coinbase is the major player in the crypto market. I see what you’re trying to say now though. And I’m still not sure whether or not I legally own my wallets on coinbase in the us. Got some reading to do now..... regardless though, I’m far less concerned that coinbase would have something like that happen to it.

Good point. A cold drive is certainly better. But I still think coin base is safer than most any other online wallet with another company. Maybe even safer than a phone or laptop connected to the internet.

Isn’t Coinbase like one of the most secure places to keep your bitcoin? It’s all insured??
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:23:09
Damn... that’s scary. I’ve heard all exchanges have shit support teams. Glad you got your money back.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:00:15
Ah I see, I guess I’d say there’s more reason to trust coinbase now then there was to trust mtgox then. But yes, in the end all exchanges are a risk and have crap customer support
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:44:13
Think again
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:21:25
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:15:29
Or nicehash whether it turns out to have been an inside job or not... I see what your saying. Yes, cold drive offline in a safe place is best.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:18:37
Yeah, I see your point. If I get a sizeable amount I’ll put it on a cold drive. Until then I’m glad I can trust coinbase somewhat haha
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:50
Okay I see why he said best of luck. I don’t agree with his reasoning, and still think coinbase is one of the safest companies to keep your coins with, but I see where he’s coming from. It would be safer to keep it in a safe on a cold drive. But, I think coinbase works better for me personally, and might be safer than keeping it on a phone or laptop with internet connection.

You’re right fuck

What is a ‘fork’?
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:09:31
He’s transacted a surprising amount imo. I wonder what country this is in

As an American I agree that’s how it should work but at the same time I’m also a contract worker who works for tips. I wish I didn’t have to but that is how my business is set up, it’s preferable for people to tip and I tip well because of this. 
This work is getting me through college debt free and I’m very grateful for it. Few people don’t tip. Please petition the business or the government instead of just hindering my milk money for the week by not tipping
