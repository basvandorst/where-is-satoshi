Such a disappointment after their successful rise, this will surely cause a dip but I’ll be buying more $pay as see them as a solid company, have been thinking beyond the current card issuers for a good while now.

What makes you think it’s people selling at a loss, and after a days investment? Of course a lot of people will see red and jump out, but do you not think that long players need to evaluate, capture their gains and find another lower entry point.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:16:12
If it was really about faster transactions they would be using the easily available litecoin or the many other altcoins that have other good uses like privacy. The only draw to bitcoin cash is to try and make quick money or gain back their money from getting in at the last ath last month

Great work, was making a website a few weeks ago and the amount of sites charging for the bitcoin accepted here icon was sickening (and none the original creator) 
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:05:33
Great work, checked out your site n will follow your socials. You should set up a [dribbble](

Think you can upload your stuff and it’ll show up on your private account and it’ll be reviewed to be included in searches. Shouldn’t take long with your quality of work. It’s a good platform to me on, seen many people hiring others and collaborating on it

We don’t want that piece of shit to promote bitcoin �� 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:48:20
Would hardly say shut down now, this was a nice off topic but witty post by the OP, I said my piece but not gunna divulge more off topic views unless its bitcoin here and specially not with a bunch of r/the_donald trolls fuckin idiots. 
I’m happy that you out of touch fuckwiths found someone with mass appeal like Kanye stupid enough to support yous but jerk yourselves off in your our sub

Ohh here comes everyone from the r/the_donald
@_date: 2018-05-08 03:06:18
Woooow how empowered did you feel to write that shite. Ok its my belief that bitcoin is a we, 
And I’d like to think that society as a whole would reject the sort of comments he has said lately and anyone that doesn’t is either a piece of shit or just trying to get needed attention like you
@_date: 2018-05-11 11:03:16
Cheers, yep plenty of websites charging for this stuff.

Why not scrap your traditional currencies completely and display items in bitcoin/sats 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:10:45
If only it was that simple. In reality for regular folk it’s too awkward to use wallets and mess around with 30+ character long addresses and if you make a slight mistake it’s gone. And any website taking bitcoin uses an ecommerce platform or intermediaries to simplify the process.

It’s a bubble........dot commmm
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:50:52
Bit excessive, but look at the big picture, I doubt you actually took the time to look at the charge sheet or the evidence, bare in mind that more charges could have been brought to him. 
In both these cases they only needed to have enough charges against them, for them to die behind bars. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:12:32
Well saying you mentioned it..... it was a few hitmen, it was brought to court as evidence, Ross didn’t deny any of it. 
As it was shown as evidence in court it was all reflected in the charges. 
It could have easily been thrown out of evidence and tested as extra charge, but it’s obvious he ordered killings. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:00:52
I doubt them scumbags are hurting, And no one knows if he sold. we only know that he moved a large amount, probably to trick everyone and also clog up the system.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:33:03
And everyone searching probably still can’t get their heads around it

Haha, love the bot
@_date: 2019-02-14 13:28:48
Yes, so many facts about the whole case get conveniently left out of the FreeRoss petitions. 
And yes, we can talk about him as if he ordered killings, because he did.
The facts that he ordered people to be killed was evidence in court and was reflected in the sentencing. 
EDIT: his lawyers could have had that evidence easily thrown out until testes, but knew it would also easily come back as extra charges of at least +40 years

@_date: 2019-02-14 20:46:33
I think you could be referring to screen grabs that were thrown out over quality, but they definitely used transcripts from his laptop ordering killings, this detailed the lengths he went to keep operating SIlk Road.

It’s crazy that this is still early days, apart from us (computer geeks) who knows how to use a wallet, make transactions or any of that mumbo jumbo. As soon as their is easy use cases your $100 fairly pay off

Can I be your friend?
@_date: 2019-02-15 22:49:36
Holy fuck, read back over what I have said. Never have I said he was charged with anything to do with murder and he wasn’t even trialed on it. 
To repeat myself, their was evidence showing that he definitely did. and this evidence was shown to EVERYONE in court, didn’t have to be charged with attempted murder, it was only used to show the lengths he went to.
P.s. the “transcript” isn’t the charge sheet, it’s messages he sent ffs
@_date: 2019-02-14 23:57:52
It did happen, it was in the trial, it was shown to jury. Just because he wasn’t charged with trying to kill someone doesn’t mean he didn’t. Do a quick search and look at the [evidence]( don’t just suck up all the FreeRoss crap.  [here is the transcript](

@_date: 2017-10-24 19:40:01
I pretty much agree with their last statement about the negativity in the groups,  like is anyone getting anywhere by constantly dragging this crap around in circles.
The ptoy team or whoever made the first post made a right cockup, they DID address the issue very clearly,
Every comment after that still referring to the LIES they told is just pointless. 
Like who in their right mind sits down and picks through the most negative comments and merges screenshots together, ohh and posts the same thing in multiple subreddits, what answer are you trying to get from it.

Can’t really rely on chart trends lines with potential forks. Instead use chart data to find support lines. Place buy orders for when they leave the support lines and have a loss order in place in case it’s a false jump and returns to support 
@_date: 2018-04-26 19:15:49
Nobody knows this shit because it never leaves the exchanges hand

I see the reference,
guys, a human with male sexual reproductive parts.
Cocky, referring to an erect penis
Down she goes, referring to the blood circulation leaving the tissues of the penis to result in the end of an erection and cross referencing this downward movement to the same as seen in near recent market movements experienced by the crypto currency space.

Kind of agree, i don’t see alts linked to bitcoin in any special way what so ever, in pretty simple terms it’s based on whichever currency has the majority market capital will have the most effect on the market. The market as a whole is controlled by emotions and whenever the dominant force moves it causes people to act
