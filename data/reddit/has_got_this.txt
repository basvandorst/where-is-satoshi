I thought that maybe some hedge funds were letting it creep up for a big dump (please don't make shitting jokes) but holy shit...I am logically certain that the up is locked in past 1000 now.  A wimpy sell might occur around then, but once it breaks, it's on it's way to 10K.  There's reasons I know this.  Fuck you, I'm not telling.

That's right.  Fuck you doctors and lawyers and Wall Street bankers (at least as far as this goes).   Being relevant, and having IT skills is finally paying off.

I have respect for doctors in terms of the sacrifice they go through but there are a lot pricky, arrogant (can anyone say God complex), and socially awkward doctors out there.

Bitcoins isn't gambling fool.  Those smart enough to understand know that this is intellectually speaking, guaranteed to go up.
