How much is enough?

I transferred money from my UK bank account on Saturday and it still hasn't arrived in my MtGox account. If this is the case, is the money gone for good or will I be able to claim a full refund? Worried now...

Thanks- Emailed them and they said any money already sent should be OK, and asked for my transaction details. Responsive customer service at least.

The way they are handling everything just reeks of amateur 
@_date: 2012-12-18 13:53:27
Agreed, 5% is insanely high

Sent money last Sat, emailed a few times but they just keep saying they're waiting to receive the transaction list from Barclays. No information on timeframes or details about what is actually happening.

Travelling miles to meet someone in order to exchange hard cash for bitcoins is not exactly the futuristic ideal of bitcoin convenience.

I have another question actually.  If I never login to my blockchain.info account (to stop risk of password keyloggers), and keep the encrypted backup safe, this is pretty bulletproof too right?

Not really true.  Once your bitcoin hoard reaches an uncomfortable percentage of your portfolio, you're going to either cash out or use the coins to buy stuff.  I just cashed out a few, because with the recent spike I felt that too much of my wealth was concentrated in just bitcoin and it's something that worried me.  I would have loved to spend them on a new computer but there are no decent vendors in my country, so I'll be buying it with fiat instead.
EDIT: I think a lot of people like myself are something of a hybrid between speculator and bitcoin enthusiast.  I'd love to see bitcoin succeed and believe in it, but I'm not about to commit my entire life savings to it just yet.  At the moment I guess I've got about a third invested, and even that is high.  During big price swings like this, I think a lot of people will think the same way and keep their investment sensible enough to not lose sleep over. When the price stabilises, it seems like slow deflation is a good thing because it will encourage people not to overspend on useless junk since their bitcoins will be worth slightly more tomorrow.

If bitcoin reaches $2000, why cash out? By the time it reaches that price, why on earth would you want to swap it for fiat?

Watching all of this with amusement, I withdrew my initial investment already so no losses here whatever happens.  
Will the lag stop when the DDOS does?  Or are we going to have to wait for the backorders to clear?

Why bother with a brainwallet if you have somewhere safe to store a paper wallet?
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:17:05
What on earth you talking about?

I bought in last September for around £7 / btc.  Pre-ordered a single from BFL as well back then.  It has been great seeing the price go up like this, but I'm going to ride the Bitcoin rollercoaster.
The only way you will lose money is if you sell.  Long term, bitcoin will be much more successful.  The protocol is sound, well tested and mature.  I won't be getting rid of any coins unless there's a glaring hole in the technology that hasn't been discovered yet- looking more and more unlikely.  
Buy in and enjoy watching the rallies and sell-offs. Keep an eye on the really important news and believe in Bitcoin.

Looks good, I have stuff to sell, will put it up later

I'm in the market for a new gaming PC. Contrary to the naysayers believing nobody buys anything in a deflationary currency, I would like to use some of my suddenly-very-valuable internet autism kroners to purchase one.
Are there any UK computer hardware vendors that accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-05-16 09:08:52
Agreed, just comes of as aggressive and stupid. Calm down and step away from the computer.
@_date: 2013-04-04 13:20:06
Then you have to pay import tax, and wait ages :/

The key word there is 'probably'. Some people don't want a million dollars worth of volatile cryptocurrency sitting around when they are working low-paid jobs, a crash would be devastating. The smart ones will spend it slowly or cash out slowly and keep their investment in bitcoin at a healthy level that isn't going to make them commit suicide if/when it crashes.

Yea I don't really fancy running a sub like that.  I was hoping we could just kick the idiots out of this one, maybe they could start their own.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:10:30
Um yeaaah... About that. Funny story...
