Yeah, you mean I haven't put thousands of dollars into it like you probably have. 
There is nothing reasonable to conclude other than that BTC and other cryptos serve very little use. Anyone saying otherwise is either misinformed, stupid, and/or has a massive stake in BTC or other crypto assets. 
If there is some better conclusion, please save me the time and share here, and tell me how you logically came to that conclusion (if you did).
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:21:36
Cool. Your mom is not a normal person then. This is all anecdotal "evidence" for your case that Bitcoin has widespread use, which is not evidence.
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:05:52
Blixx is just butthurt that he was destroyed by real thinking by someone who isn't obsessed with BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:01:49
There was no alternative to the internet that completed the same tasks except better. There is for crypto-"currency", and it's called *real* currency, which is actually stable in the relatively long-term.
Nice try comparing the two, but only an ill-informed individual would accept your comparison as valid.
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:50:00
Well, I see no reason to *believe* in it. You seem to be going long, which is fine, but it explains why you are so stubborn to explain what real benefits cryptos have compared to regular currency, and why the trade-offs are worth it for normal individuals. I wish you good luck, but you have failed to explain what there is to "believe in".
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:10:28
Ah yes, because I don't have "crypto" in my name and bow down with all the other obsessors and praise BTC and cryptos for no good reason, that must mean I am a "bot". You are pathetic.

Think this all you want, but if the masses thought this to be the case (or cared about the issues you mention), they would have adopted BTC long ago. But they don't. They want money that can be moved quickly, easily, and not be subject to speculative moves. That is why millions use services like PayPal and Venmo, and nobody uses BTC to pay each other (besides computer nerds), because nobody understands it. Get a grip of reality...
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:02:31
Yes, because Linux is an architecture and software development system that works well for the computer nerds making the programs for normal people to use. Your post is implying that banks and other payment processers will use it, meaning that it will inadvertently be used by regular folks. The fact is that banks will not touch the extremely volatile crypto-currencies with a 39 and a half foot pole (not like they need to), therefore it (crypto) will not be used, directly or indirectly, by the masses.
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:08:49
Not sure if you even know what that saying is used for, but okay. It doesn't seem like you do.
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:04:21
Cool. Almost nobody does, and only computer nerds know how or care enough to do so.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:07:53
Like I said, not compared to the amount of active users. Not sure what world you have been living in...
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:32:07
That's interesting, but you should know that very few people care about "neutrality" when it comes to their money. They don't like to think about it, and want it easily accessible. Each to his own, but we are talking about regular people here, and they don't want BTC.
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:29:31
I lack "vision" for failing to see any major benefits of using Bitcoin for average people? Nope, I am just thinking logically and being honest with myself, and not lying to others because I have thousands staked in BTC or another crypto asset (like many do on this forum) and can't bare to see the price fall. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:37:09
You are aware that block-chain technology does not have to be used for moving digital (unbacked) assets, right? 
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:26:39
They have done nothing relating to actually implementing or seriously considering crypto-currencies. They have vagudly considered perhaps using block-chain *technology*, but not volatile crypto assets. Is your primary crypto news source CoinDesk or another biased crypto-currency praising tech blog?
@_date: 2019-01-04 02:53:46
For sure. Those are not normal everyday working class people who are over the age of 25, that is a small portion of the world and perhaps yourself. Not too many have been suspended from PayPal. Seriously, almost nobody has been co.pared to how many active users they still have. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:29:58
I am naming a viable alternative, not one with the exact same specifications. Believe it or not, almost *nobody* cares about having a "decentralized" currency they have "control over" (which they don't even), besides perhaps Ron Paul revolutionaries and other crazies. Nice try. Go into the real world for a few days, and find some normal people outside of your online chat groups that actually uses crypto on a daily basis. I will wait here, forever. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:13:19
It's been 10 years, and BTC has only gotten more volatile. Yeah, it's not going anywhere...
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:24:47
Ok. But that doesn't make it the future of American monetary transactions, like the dreamers and delusional individuals on here seem to think. I agree, it could be *useful* to some, but it isn't a world revolutionizing technology like some want to believe it is. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:55:38
Yeah, no it won't. People won't compromise for a product that is slower to move money, and comes with fees. Maybe 30 years ago, but not today. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:25:52
Yeah, no they aren't. Gen Z and millennials are using PayPal and Venmo to move money and complete transactions, not Bitcoin. Not sure what alternative reality you're living in...
@_date: 2019-01-03 06:54:53
Think as you may.
@_date: 2019-01-20 17:54:40
I don't plan on adopting it for a payment method, but it actually has real value if you want to use it as a stable investment.
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:07:44
Yes, because it is too volatile, and serves very little logical purpose for them to do so. They work with a very small bottom-line, and can't run their business based on whether the crypto markets are up or down. They (the banks) like stability, and so does everyone else.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:03:20
Please read my reply to Blixx87 above. Your comparison is totally invalid...
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:33:39
Keep dreaming that your beloved fake online gold will become the future of online transactions, despite the fact that our current system works great. I provided a valid alternative that people besides Redditors and basement-dwellers like to use, which is what really matters. You are completely out of touch with reality. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 04:59:00
Sorry buddy, the burden of proof lies on *you* to prove that big banks are seriously interested in touching crypto after the crash. They aren't.
@_date: 2019-01-08 04:48:30
It's a bubble.
@_date: 2019-01-03 05:22:17
Of course there is. There is an alternative to crypto-**currencies**, and they are called real currencies, backed by trillion-dollar economies. How is it "taking control" of their own money to use crypto, when it is so volatile that their money could be up 10% one day, and down 30% the next? 
You are so out of touch with what people want. They want a fast and easy to understand payment method, not a slow and costly one that requires a middleman (miner) that charges a fee and takes time to process through means that almost nobody understands. Venmo and PayPal are used by millions daily, and allow people to move their money easilly, for free, and with no volatility. 
How can you even think that crypto-currencies are an appealing method of payment for common folks? ��
