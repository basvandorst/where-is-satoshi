I believe I may have screwed something up at the "nano /etc/fstab" step. However, I thought I recovered as I ended up getting past the errors I was getting around that step. At this point, I have a lot of issues with accessing the file system. When I try to run a lot of these commands in the guide, I get messages back saying that the file system is read only. I.E. I can't even send the shutdown -r now command to the odroid unless I switch to root user.
At the stage where you are supposed to change your rpc password, if I leave it at the default it works, if I change it to the password I set for user bitcoin, it doensn't work (can't run blockchain command). 
I feel like starting over would be easier. So, I don't have to do anything to the hard disk, just format the sdcard and start again?

This looks really cool! I ordered all the parts and started to play with it last night. I tried to get this going and now I feel stuck. Not sure how to "restart" from the top and try again. Is there a way to wipe everything clean and start over?

HC2. I have things running but it seems like I can't send a payment.
I don't see any channels running and my public IP reachable status seems to fluctuate when I check with "thundroid".

You're right, think I am just being impatient. Tried the command a few more times and it eventually went through. Thanks for your help!

Just formatted the sdcard, reflashed it, now stuck at the second command if "apt upgrade". Output below:
root apt upgrade
E: Could not get lock /var/lib/dpkg/lock - open (11: Resource temporarily unavailable)
E: Unable to lock the administration directory (/var/lib/dpkg/), is another process using it?

Any idea what is happening here? Not sure what I am missing.
I am at this step: check that the reference checksum matches the real checksum
$ sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS.asc --ignore-missing
admin sha256sum --check SHA256SUMS.asc --ignore-missing
bitcoin-0.16.0-arm-linux-gnueabihf.tar.gz: OK
sha256sum: WARNING: 20 lines are improperly formatted

 Haha sadly I am already doing that. I am a noob with Linux.
I have made it further than last time :) Appreciate your help. 
Stuck again at this part:
go install . ./cmd/...

I just sent from GDAX to my Ledger segwit address. I didn't get anything about invalid address and the coin made it. Are we sure that segwit isn't already implemented?
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:50:14
I did it from GDAX to my segwit address on my ledger nano. My segwit address starts with the number 3.

I also closed my Kraken account as a result of issues with their verification process. Only place that I have had an issue and therefore had to close my account. Not only did it take forever to come back after submitting verification, it took even longer to close my account. Awful customer support.
