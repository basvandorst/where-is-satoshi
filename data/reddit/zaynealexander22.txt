You could not have said it any better!

Sounds like your ego believes in a mystery like Scooby doo. He gave no advice u dipshit. He simply said jump out because he's to scared to take a risk and get rich like you. Prove some valid fuckking info and then talk to me bro. And his advice actually would have cost me the easy $2.5k I made trading crypto just an hour ago

Hahhaha bro that was by far the most ignorant thing I have ever herd. Hahha your jealous your country is bullshit. You probly pay half your earning in taxes and think it’s ok lol. Little does you actually paying your high officials and they fuck you so hard and you love it. It’s insane to me. There is no place better, more advanced, accepting, free, and powerful than America. We run the fuckin world you dumb shit. You live under a rock and I thank god I don’t live anywhere other than USA. Land of the Free Home of the brave. You live in land of a slave.

Tell me how they aren’t relevant when your on here talking about them. I love the hate. It’s awesome ��. Bitcoin is the new way of life. I hope You read this one day look at it and realize how dumb you were. I guarantee you have little to no knowledge of what a bitcoin is and does.

Your argument was sad, bias, and simple minded. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 08:32:14
Bro first off. If you rely on google your the problem with the internet. Your an idiot. Second you have no information to support your wildly bias claim about comparing oil prices with bitcoin. Oil is a bullshit government run industry. Bitcoin is freedom! We don’t even really need oil. There’s so many better ways to generate the electricity needed. 3rd. Your first line of your argument already contradicts what your saying. Lol. This was a pathetic funny article. That was a Good laugh. “Yeah... You can't just make claims like that and not provide any sources”. Says the guy who makes a claim right after and has no source hahahha. Oh I forgot he has google. Woahhhhh. Fuxk the internet. Dark net shit 666
