A crucial point that Andreas made and many missed: Ascicboost increases energy efficiency by 20%, but that translates to an increase in profits by 2000%. And there is the answer as of why Jihan and Roger are fighting tooth and nail to suppress SEGWIT and any progress that threatens that obscene cheating.

Asicboost is a tech that makes mining easier. It's patented by Bitmain (the ones pushing BU and blocking segwit) and it gives a $100mm per year incentive to block all kinds of useful soft forks like segwit, committed bloom filters and most kinds of fraud proofs. Also provides an incentive to mine empty or near-empty blocks, defeating the point of the blockchain as a payment network.
Here's some links:
details and discovery by gmaxwell 
reddit thread with discussion 
simplified explaination by jonny1000 
evidence 
bitmain admits their chips have asicboost but they say they never used it on the network (haha a likely story) 
worth $100m per year to them 
this also blocks all these other cool updates, not just segwit 
summary of bad consequences of asicboost 
prices goes up because now segwit looks more likely 
asicboost discovery made the price rise

No iam saying that beeing your own bank has nothing to do with the amnount of money you have
even if its just 100 USDollar, you can still put that into bitcoin, there is no minimum amnount 
It makes no difference if  you invest 100 USDollar und get 100 digital Coins or if you invest 100 and get 0.00xxx coins
in the end you still invested 100 us dollar

If you have the bcash on coinbase you can just sell them, as coinbase made sure that the chains are splitted and the coins aswell

Also - SegWit would unintentionally cause it to stop working because it changes the way the block data is structured and it appears that this is why SegWit has been apposed so much be Jihan. See this for more recent news:

I thought it gives them about 30% more hashes per second as they abuse some "bug"? And that this bug cant be used with segwit, so thats why they hate it
i never heard that it  has something to do with empty blocks, are you sure this isnt fud?

I think this is an error.  A salary of 15k us dollar per month is not common in japan
