With what exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:48:40
Yeah man that's 2 people are needed aha. I have ID verified there.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:07:27
I suspect its bots on the aus exchanges? Could be aussie demand though
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:10:10
Either the aussie exchanges are small enough to be manipulated by bots, or the aussie demand is very high for crypto right now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:41:03
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:06:48
How? Measures would be put in place obviously.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:19:21
Not true, it really went up around 1 week ago. I've been using them the last couple months
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:02:47
Let's talk. I've DM'd you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:15:26
Because I'm not Australian. The only one australians can do is coinbase but there is a weekly limit of 500 dollars lol...
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:15:48
AUD? lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:02:18
Yep I want to buy but it's so exxy...
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:20:44
**not american
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:13:26
Because I'm not verified on US, and you can't get verified on aus exchange
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:01:56
Nah :/
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:06:42
I can't because I can't get verified on US exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:02:01
Moonboy confirmed. Love how you said "less than an hour". If you were paid in a **good** currency you would have been paid in Litecoin - and you have got in much faster ;)
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:44:41
Did you solve this?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:16:32
We'd figure it out between us so there's a reliable system in place so we both don't get scammed. I DM'd you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:10:13
How are you profiting?
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:19:01
Nah man it's possible. I made 40 bucks today from a $500 LTC purchase &amp; transfer.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:51:28
Nah, I did it today and made 50 bucks. It am stopped because of my daily limit.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:21:06
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:59:06
And why is it a once in a lifetime opportunity?
@_date: 2017-01-06 10:43:14
I drew my own Shrek &amp; Donkey^TM graph. It shows that Bitcoin will skyrocket to a million dollars. Buy now.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:21:01
So is it a good time or not
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:40:59
Depends on the family. Poor families, sure USD200 is fine. Richer families like mine can spend USD5000+ on Christmas. :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:13:19
Is there any point in buying BTC? Aren't fees really high right now or something?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:19:39
Oh, have exchanges raised their withdrawal fees rn?
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:54:38
@_date: 2017-11-10 00:40:14
Sent :) I also got my friend's to send 1 each as well. I'm hopeful you'll get them back!
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:05:56
I agree, but I also dont
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:54:12
Same :D
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:22:12
Wow, sorry to see this man :/ I've had this happen to me before on another exchange. Maybe I can send them a ticket myself regarding your account? Might draw more attention to it!
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:29:00
The past is not reflective of the future
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:54:43
Litecoin because this one YouTuber told me
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:55:00
Is the fee on withdrawing or actually buying the BTC on exchanges?
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:10:33
Which fork is this and when is it?
