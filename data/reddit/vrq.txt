That giant $75 buy-wall was destroyed like it wasn't even there.

And I'm sure I'm not the only one to think about how much power this gives the people ddosing Gox. I know we don't like speculation, but I think I already have the answer as to whether Bitcoin is going to survive this round - I can even begin to imagine how the attackers might have actually helped Bitcoin in the long run. 
That is, I don't think most of us realized the infrastructure of the exchange was this weak. If our best exchange can't handle some ddos, and if all the other exchanges follow the first one blindly... this would have been that much more disastrous if the price were to rise any higher.

It takes a while to get used to their interface, but I love trading with bitfloor. The fees are so small (and negative on limit orders) that it's actually possible to make some money with small trades provided your fingers are fast enough. 
One thing I don't like is the discrepancy between buying and selling the limit orders: when selling BTC I can just enter the amount of BTC I have, choose the limit price (fill in two fields), and sell - it computes the dollar amount (the third missing field) automatically. But when I'm buying, I have to fill in all three fields. I can't just enter the total amount buying, the limit price, and have it compute the bitcoin amount, I have to whip out a calculator and enter the bitcoin amount manually.. it takes away precious seconds so on buying I usually resort to market trades.

Bitstamp's fees are OK, but I wish they offered a small liquidity rebate like bitfloor. Then I'm on board.

Aren't you a speculator too? You seem to be speculating the price will go up. 
Here's what I see:
Mt Gox Lag -&gt; Mt Gox Price drops -&gt; All other exchanges Price drops
Once Mt Gox Lag ceases -&gt; Prices resume going up
Do you see something fundamentally wrong with this? Whatever is causing the lag - whether it's ddos script kiddies, Mt. Gox incompetence, or even Bernanke himself - it doesn't matter. The point is, there is a massive systemic weakness since way too much power lies in the hands of whoever that entity is. 
If you can agree, you should not be speculating that the price will go up - nor should you be hoping it would - anytime soon. The only reason you would want the price to rise right now is to recoup your losses and sell. The longer you stay in this manipulated market, the more you will lose.

For someone who is so concerned about providing 1 person with an ID, you sure are OK with telling a whole subreddit of strangers so much about yourself. Just saying. Scan your driver's license and upload it to them if you want to withdraw USD. How hard is that?

Holy shit, I almost had a heart attack just reading that.

In any case, looks like there's about a $25 spread. Most people have their buy walls at $160 and below, and only a tiny amount moved past that to 170-180 and left a huge gap so you tell me why that happened.

Are any mods here, this spammer has gotten out of hand posting these dangerous links. S/he is always downvoted, but I cringe at the thought of people falling for this. I know whysohappy11 (or his handler) is just doing what he can to feed himself, but is there any way he can be stopped, perhaps by blocking that url in this subreddit?
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:27:26
Yes, leave that to the big boys.

It's thin. Probably between acquaintances.

Can an exchange restrict HFT? I guess the big reason they wouldn't is because they're making huge profits from the bots, but obviously their servers can't handle it so at which point do they factor in their long-term reputation? If all the human traders go elsewhere, there isn't going to be *any*-frequency trading on Gox.
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:15:46
FYI, this isn't recent, that message has been there for a while. I just checked, things are pretty smooth at Bitfloor right now.

The price has only been stable for 8 hours. Personally, I'm not getting any funds out of the exchange until we see real stability. Til then, I'm playing the market. Why? To end up with more Bitcoins in the end.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:57:34
I think it has the real potential for the primary global peer-to-peer unit of exchange for primarily virtual-based services. There are some serious kinks to be worked out before we get to that point. The software isn't perfect by any means, and there's a huge learning curve (for the average person) to get to a point where you can merely *feel* like your bitcoins are secure. If this succeeds, it's going to be very slow and gradual. 
I think Bitcoins always rise in price whenever there's a novel use for them discovered. Bitcoin was born quietly, but Silk Road was like the baby opening its' eyes and starting to cry - it has a pulse! After the first correction (I'm starting to see why this word makes more sense than a *crash*, even if it's just semantics - crash implies death), Satoshi Dice appeared - the price was around $5 and I remember instantly knowing that people are going to want bitcoins now that gambling with 98.5% (at the time) return was so accessible.
Then of course there are Girls for Bitcoin or whatever... all of these are examples where Bitcoin has been a successful means to satisfy some human urge that was previously harder to satisfy: Sex, Drugs, Gambling. These base layers will always hold up Bitcoin from ever reaching zero, these markets will never go away. There are still similar markets undiscovered or yet un-tapped-in to. 
The guy who made satoshi-dice profited immensely from a simple, relatively easy to make application. There are big gains to be had for the next great idea. While the price of Bitcoin might drop, I believe its' value is only going to go up.
I also hate to say this, because I don't want you fuckers buying it yet :)

Google Java Bitcoin Exploit and see if it looks familiar (there's a thread on bitcointalk- "How I got robbed of 34 btc on Mt.Gox today"). If it does and you ran it, your funds at Gox may be compromised.

According to Bitfloor's site:


The key word is government currencies. If you want to withdraw USD, you need to upload an ID, this was always there. But if you want to put BTC in, trade, and take BTC out... this should not require any ID. If this changed, it's definitely news to me. As far as I understand it right now, to withdraw BTC you do not need to show an ID.

I hope you didn't go to this spammer's link... if you did, I hope that wasn't Java on it... if it was, I hope you didn't allow it to run... if you did, I hope you don't have funds in a Mt. Gox account.

Because the older the reddit account you're posting from is, the more your opinion matters.
@_date: 2013-04-13 19:05:24
He's not doing anything wrong by buying at a price he sees as cheap. Without his purchase, the coins would go even lower until someone decides that is cheap enough for them. This volatility is completely natural as we're still in the pricefinding phase. 
He's actually taking a risk in buying those "cheap" coins; he might be buying in right when everyone else just says "fuck it, I'm done". Whichever investor gets scared should leave and re-enter when he feels less frightened. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:21:14
Can it be that all the selling that has triggered the lag? I have never seen a lagless drop on Mt. Gox. Maybe it's because of this people have associated lag with huge selling, and it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy of sorts. That, or they conveniently get ddos'd whenever someone wants to drop a huge load? 
17+ minutes lag now.

Bitfloor's market data goes offline at the same time
Edit: Now it's back

I think we'll find stability at 30, but it might drop even lower, probably over the course of next week. Today's Friday, and I doubt many people are going to want to hold this over the weekend. 
I think a lot of people here are still in denial mode, so make your own conclusions :)

Thanks! I had no idea.

There's only so much Magic the Gathering Exchange can do. Have you considered that maybe they're in over their heads too at this massive growth? Worst case scenario is that, the bitcoin community will realize it doesn't have a stable exchange with high liquidity, take their money out and use OTC - you know what will happen? The price will stabilize, for one. 
Then, the community will learn from the mistakes and be able to begin figuring out how to meet these challenges for the future. Don't ever worry about "investors being scared" or "people will abandon" anything, only worry about what You plan to do. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere in the long run, no need to rush things. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:36:18
So we all notice that the other markets are trading in *real-time* based on the *lagged* gox data? Psychologically, it seems people associate BTC price with Gox's quote, whether it's lagged or not.
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:57:59
I was wondering when this article would show up, not at all surprised huffpo got to it first. Bitcoins made available drugs, gambling, and sex to anyone who had some - nobody should be surprised that people are dealing weapons with it. It was just a matter of time before the media picked up on it.
