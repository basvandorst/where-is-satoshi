to some extent the damage is psychological.  BTC going up in the long term is dependent on adoption both through businesses and people.  This is most likely going to scare many new people away from coming into the fold of cryptocurrencies, at least for the time being.

This is called 'arbitrage' the buying and selling of economic products in real time in the hope of making money.  Ignore the two people that responded to you, they're just frustrated that this does get asked a lot.  The reality is that because BTC is so new it takes a significant amount of time to send or receive money or BTC from an exchange so arbitrage is for the most part out of the question for the time being.

at the going rate and the direction BTC is going it would be a really bad investment at this point, unless you love the idea of helping the infrastructure and want to learn about mining. You won't make any money off of it.

In a very level headed way, the panel who consisted of government employees (DHS etc) and a member a concerned member against child exploitation discussed both assets and deficits of cryptocurrencies.  Then a panel consisting of BTC developers and business owners did the same. Overwhelmingly positive response, the Senator heading the hearing was bright, articulate and admitted he is playing catchup but that cryptocurrencies seem valid and ground breaking.

no one knows anything more than you, and yes psychology plays a huge part in this movement.  The difference between this and any other investment is that this could and I emphasize could revolutionize payments.  Hence the mass hysteria, to the moon sentiment.  They may be right.  However I believe it's so early and so many factors could contribute to a mass sell off.  It is a confusing process to procure/secure BTC and we see peoples wallets getting hacked everyday.  I believe the attacks are only going to get more sophisticated due to the nature of just how much it's gone up and who can say if a flaw in the code won't be discovered causing a mass panic?  None of us has a crystal ball.

@_date: 2013-11-25 00:57:47
it's going to be a double edged sword. If you look at a traditional stock, when hedge funds start buying into it, it goes up and is lent a great deal of legitimacy.  BTC will get a great deal of legitimacy from large blocks being bought but is that giving up some of the power to these entities? yes, yes it is.

it's called arbitrage, people do it in the stock market all the time.  However because BTC is such a new technology there are delays in converting money to BTC and vice versa. It's just not realistic to be able to shift around that quickly yet. There's a strong possibility that you'd lose your shirt trying arbitrage with BTC.

What I'd do? with refi rates as low as they are I'd cash out 25-30%. Throw that at your house through a refi, you'll save tens of thousands (if not six figures).  With the additional disposable income because of the savings on your mortgage you'll have so many more financial options.  Invest in some more conservative financial products, hang on to some BTC for the long run and slowly sell as the price goes up.  
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:28:03

of course you can make gold, it was made by mining it. the same theoretical way that BTC is made. And governments weren't any more stable when it was the gold standard.  It's all part of the social contract. currency works because we believe it works.

@_date: 2013-12-08 00:59:23
To be honest, this is pretty refreshing. Common sense...no emotion, just 'here's what's going on, I'm not emotionally involved, it's most likely going to get bigger." There are so many people driving themselves to losing sleep over day to day (and hour to hour) stuff. It's not worth losing your emotional health.  Congrats again.

@_date: 2013-11-23 17:58:24
I am certainly no expert but I'm happy to help if you need some advice.
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:40:25
if this works, you're totally awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:19:50
glad to hear that.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:12:57
Do you know about Sean's Outpost? He's on here a lot and works intensively with homeless people, it's a beautiful charity.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:53:14
did you try updating the blockchain on Multibit? sometimes it just hasn't synced yet.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:31:19
Here's a story: I'm self employed and now I take Bitcoin, yo. You got an addiction problem or a life problem? I can most likely fix you.
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:17:01
@_date: 2013-12-12 22:40:23
and now they're even rarer.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:52:59
that kid is gonna make 2 grand today.
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:25:32
thank ya kindly.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:28:42
he's already made 2 grand. I think you can stop now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:08:05
this is satire, people.  It's smart to raise awareness of what the landscape could look like.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:19:48
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:19:10
yup, I get it. congrats on all your success. good for you.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:48:16
try that.
@_date: 2013-11-26 03:17:33
he was challenged to bet 1 BTC on it happening and he shortly abandoned the thread after that when prompted to put the BTC in escrow.  He was making it up.
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:57:16
there's a button in the message to accept, hover over it and click. and when you want to move it elsewhere I'm sure we'd be more than happy to help.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:39:12
you realize you just posted a picture of a safe on Reddit? May god have mercy on your soul.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:44:21
yeah, this sounds like a false sense of security to me.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:16:48
I would think it would be worth an hour of your time to do a search on those DVD's. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 05:19:19
I think it looks great, my suggestion would be in addition to mentioning the QR code have an actual image of a code so you can explain what it is and what it does.  I'm wondering if a two or three minute video might help your 'marketing.'
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:18:37
i think allowing small and large businesses to get paid instantly while saying anywhere between 3-7% of their sales (which is what Paypal and credit cards charge) is an extraordinary contribution to any economic base. i think his argument doesn't hold any weight.  There's nothing about a currency that needs to have industrial use for it to be succesful.  Have you ever tried to buy anything with gold? yeah...tell your friend good luck with that.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:38:24
good for you, congrats on your success.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:47:00
wow, that must be a huge relief.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:41:40
oh, that's not too bad at all. thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:41:41
it could be, it happens all the time on stock exchanges. BTC has a long way to go before it could happen. and you're welcome.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:34:09
makes perfect sense, and his art is stunning.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:04:49
some of them, it's up to the mods of each subreddit to enable it or not.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:03:39
unless their password has already been changed.
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:57:17
well done.
@_date: 2013-11-25 00:20:42
how about some kind of verification?
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:44:34
Additional idea: hit up the mods of the subreddits you're interested in.  I know in the main moderator just started tipping people for posts and although I knew a bit about bitcoin at that point suddenly having a whole 8 cents worth was actually kind of exciting.  It was my first BTC...and now that I think about it, it's probably worth like 16 cents by now.
@_date: 2013-05-09 01:39:30
if this flies, I will be so happy.
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:11:30
best possible update.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:30:41
A lot of good points here. I am concerned about the mob mentality behind the rise.  It could be the currency of the future but I think people need to stop being so emotionally involved in it and look realistically at what's going on.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:17:08
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:00:38
so...any updates?
@_date: 2013-11-26 14:25:50
If they're small enough companies (self employed) there is no reason you can't just have them give out their wallet address (which can also be the QR code that comes with the wallet) to receive BTC as payment.  Otherwise look into Bitpay to receive compensation for their goods and services.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:43:11
so...is the moral of the story that if you could have used BTC this wouldn't have happened?
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:56:08
good luck! keep us in the loop.
@_date: 2013-12-01 14:13:43
first of all, you can keep them on blockchain and still use 2 factor authentication to keep them much safer.  I can help you with the process if you need.
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:03:01
more than likely.
@_date: 2013-11-18 15:24:55
If I have made the decision to start accepting BTC for services rendered (addictions professional/life coach) do I need to do anything more than simply get a wallet and give clients the address?
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:22:18
does this offer apply to people that lurk this subreddit?
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:59:25
don't forget 2 factor auth. on blockchain
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:07:43
good luck dude, hope you get it back.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:01:30
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:42:44
the profile is interesting too, 4 comments, each one a tip and nothing else. that's an interesting mystery.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:18:22
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:07:07
I'd wave at you but you can't see me anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:34:57
maybe you've got a secret benefactor? could be a Great Expectations kind of thing...probably not.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:58:13
if you're building a custom PC for this then you must be considering holding a large proportion of your BTC.  Sell off enough to cover your initial investment, and make a decision about staggering your future sell points in terms of dollar amounts.  
@_date: 2013-11-25 19:38:56
fuck, good luck man. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:31:23
check all your emails from that time frame, you must have sent or received an email from this website.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:58:43
that's amazing.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:51:32
you fucking rule.
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:41:42
that's pretty amazing.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:35:41
it is one nutty, kooky thing going on here.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:13:41
ok, strong point. how many addicts and alcoholics use BTC? Can you all just line up right here...
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:05:40
nice, congrats.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:56:49
2FA immediately.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:37:32
I keep seeing posts like this, just for the record I've recently started accepting BTC.  I'm an addictions professional/life coach. I'm not saying you're an addict but a lot of people are getting a little overwhelmed by this whole thing and I can probably help.
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:43:30
do you remember what words/phrase you used to find the video in the first place? I'm just brain storming...
@_date: 2013-11-24 17:16:43
what about restoring an old backup? do you backup with any frequency?
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:32:11
check out Bitpay.com
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:24:21
which addiction did you want?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:27:39
BONUS POINTS FOR AL GORE JOKES
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:47:45
did you confirm this yet?
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:49:32
ok, thank you for the clarification. that seems very reasonable.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:44:52
dude...get some sleep.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:15:37
this is the only rational reason.
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:03:46
whoops, my bad.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:04:03
that's a great story.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:19:49
you're sceptical.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:44:10
this could either be nothing or really, really interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:05:23
congrats on your profit.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:02:55
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:53:41
this is a good plan, I like this plan...
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:31:37
yeah, this isn't just a BTC. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:14:57
you can tip people directly through their email address to coinbase. I'm guessing it's just a matter of time.  Go to and hit up the creater of the bot. I'm sure he'd tell you if it's feasible or if he's even already working on it.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:57:50
good for you.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:22:05
is it about you?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:32:42
as some random guy on the internet I just wanted to give you props for how perfectly you handled that situation.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:59:44
you're being quite generous tonight, i really do appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:13:39
that's roughly $80...congrats.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:46:02
congrats, well done.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:57:19
yeah, there's always a 12 word sequence in case you misplace your identifier. Let's try to jog your memory in terms of the password. Do you remember when you got the account? Maybe you added a 1 at the beginning or the end?
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:22:28
well...there you have it folks.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:37:38
that's amazing. congrats.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:16:55
It can't hurt to file a police report, they may follow up on it.  Especially if he has done it before, and if he hasn't he will do it again in the future and this could be the first strike against him.
@_date: 2013-11-28 14:15:04
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:55:32
that's some pretty good reasoning there. congrats on all the success.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:41:59
thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:58:05
low fees and chargebacks I get. I'm not too worried about civil forfeiture.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:55:41
they are completely swamped, no definite time line but everybody seems happy. Be patient, it'll eventually happen.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:50:16
shhh...let 'em talk.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:37:47
much obliged, thank ya kindly.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:21:35
do we have any guesses as to who these people are?
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:09:11
Some people were selling, it dropped a bit...went back up to  1K.  Nothing crazy. Friday was a business day, Thursday was not.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:33:29
.1 BTC makes a real nice gift too.
@_date: 2013-11-27 21:00:07
good luck.
@_date: 2013-12-01 00:19:22
This is an excellent point. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:15:37
you're welcome. let me know if you find it. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:39:42
ok, no fees is a big plus. I currently accept paypal and although it is really convenient there is a fee. This is a big plus for BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-29 18:20:06
congrats man, that's an amazing windfall.  Do yourself a favor and check the sidebar for best security practices.  You might want to sell some, put the money in the bank, save some for taxes and hang on to some. Treat yourself and your family to an amazing Christmas.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:11:54
I don't know about KeePass but have you tried reaching out to them? They may have a workaround if other people are having the same issue, if you can prove beyond a shadow of a doubt that it is your account?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:39:25
it's actually a great idea. The developers could even get involved and grant you some blockchain powers.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:14:53
that's pretty cool of you.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:03:45
It should be a rollercoaster this week with the news from China, I'd suggest just hang in there and don't do anything impulsive.
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:01:34
for all that bad luck you've still done very well for yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:09:29
people seem to be saying good things about coinbase, are you in the US and what kind of wallet are you installing?
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:20:41
that's absolutely amazing. congrats.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:47:08
Good point, I accept cash, checks and paypal currently. Wouldn't I have to wait to a period of time to exchange to USD if I needed to pay overhead?
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:51:17
yeah, the general consensus is spend the same money on BTC that you would have spent on mining equipment. If you've done well and the BTC are burning a hole in your pocket spend some on yourself for an early holiday gift through a vendor that accepts it. Best thing to do for the BTC economy at this point.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:00:27
I was being serious (I know...hard to believe)
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:33:53
why don't you just use a QR code from your wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-30 20:36:07
what about checking your browser history to find the youtube video you used? maybe there's a simple step you forgot?
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:55:58
c'mon six!
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:30:27
I think you're going to get answers across the board to this question.  I know that in America there is a great deal of anti-government/anti-taxation sentiment currently which just happens to coincide with what appeals to some of the people that are intrigued/invested in BTC.  Some countries allocate more of their tax base to humanitarian concerns (healthcare/education) whereas some governments are more inclined to spend the money on things which don't benefit citizens directly.  Depending on who is responding and where they're from you'll get your answers.  I'd like to believe that people who withhold taxes from the government would donate to charities on their own but I have no idea if that will actually happen.  Ethics and morality tend to be such a personal thing.
@_date: 2013-11-28 00:03:41
maybe update your client? sometimes it needs to sync which it can't do without updating.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:47:03
you might want to get your comment karma up to positive numbers before you keep trolling.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:49:26
you pretty much just doubled my holdings...
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:07:36
2 BTC will buy a lot of bloody marys tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2013-11-10 01:11:33
what's the huge disappointment?
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:31:10
good luck man, that could be awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:26:06
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:41:51
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:42:14
that's what I was thinking.
@_date: 2013-11-18 14:15:54
thanks for the heads up.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:39:11
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:42:52
you're awesome.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:47:37
good for you.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:51:50
oh...dear, can't help you. most car mechanics either know how to weld/solder or know someone who does. got a good mechanic?
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:37:44
provided proof in the original thread. It's him.
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:44:57
yay Santa!
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:38:22
fuck, really sorry it played out this way.
@_date: 2013-11-23 17:56:54
it shouldn't be too hard to start a wallet on coinbase and transfer the coins to there. just don't forget to enable 2 factor authentication so they won't be able to steal your remaining coins. plenty of security ideas on the sidebar.
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:20:02
more details...
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:22:58
I never thought something like this could happen to me...
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:47:53
maybe that's the look he was going for?
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:43:04
I think that one of the defining concepts behind BTC is a truly free market. Your 'no leech' concept goes against exactly that. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:00:22
This is the sixth post I've seen about this sort of thing, I'm a little worried about y'all. I think we need to give this syndrome a name. BTSD? and no, this isn't healthy for you. PM me if you want some help.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:25:26
I'm self employed and I recently started accepting BTC and to be honest it was the feedback from this subreddit that helped me wade through the process so thank you for and everybody else who helped.
@_date: 2013-11-23 22:51:08
nothing has ever not happened as much as this has not happened.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:58:21
is it even more ironic that people are tipping in @_date: 2013-12-01 05:03:02
that's...a really good question.  Maybe he...forgot his password?
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:33:52
yeah...that's...not good. I can help you with that.
