When BTC went from 4k to 6k everyone said wait for the dip, then it went to 7k, they said wait for the dip, then 8k, then 9k then 10k, then 11k it's now 12k, is this dip ever gonna happen?

I've been into BTC since 2014, I'm just poking fun at all the youtubers that think they know it all saying wait for the dip when it was shooting pass all resistance ever since 4k to now 12.5k without ever making much of a dip at all.

Looks like the big dip is finally here, now the question is will people buy it?

You don't get ads if you pay for google music with youtube red. I have a family plan $15 a month for 6 people, its like $3 per person. Dirt cheap for all the music and youtube red.

No she didn't cuase bitcoin never dipped below 6k after the 19k bull run.
She bought at 4k means it was just before the bull run, so best purchase time.

If all you need is to double your money, then just take a look at alt coins that do this weekly. Or put everything on a roulette table.

That depends on which exchange you are looking at. 6k was close enough. Some exchanges bitcoin went over 20k while most were just under 20k

You can buy crypto currency on ebay. You can use changelly.com to convert most popular coins.

Every youtuber said don't FOMO when it was 6300 cause 6400 was hard resistance and it will dip from there, well that didn't happen. Fucking YouTube TA, think they know it all.
Wonder what YouTube headlines will be this morning.

thats not so bad, doing 30 push ups every time bitcoin drops $100 would be worse.

Remember last bull run only from 5 weeks to go from 5k to 20k. When you see a massive dip of 50% that is likely the top of the next bull run, then pray it bounce to about 70% of the top, sell there.

Trade devil had the best TA yesterday,  he said yes there is big resistance at 6400, BUT, why fight the uptrend.  Guess he was right.

imagine having 98 BTC and not selling it during the last bull run, great story, hard to believe but im sure it could be real.
selling now would be $780,000 if you can't setup your kids with that much then move out of the hamptons and into a more reasonable neighborhood.
don't be this guy [

You're glass empty kind of guy.

Don't go in the office this morning, that crypto currency guy that was so happy last week will be PISSED!
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:33:14
I disagree, Bitcoin has survived 5 years, its taken harder hits before and it will take this one just the same. If price drops below $200 then i'd start to question it.

My advice to OP, when you get your bitcoin, sell it and never buy crypto Currency or try Forex, youre not ready for the volatility. Try treasury notes, bonds, but at the rate the government is printing money, you just might break even.
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:03:08
What i've learn from Forex martet, Don't ever try to catch a falling knife, unless you know where to grab it.

People that don't pay for electricity will always mine.

You're right China is not the work, just 1/7th of it.

Actually you lose money in a savings account due to inflation.
@_date: 2013-12-18 10:48:05
you are absolutely right, NOTHING is free.
some people steal electricity from work or neighbors, I use to live in an apartment that no matter how much electricity you use, you pay the same amount.
the big time investors most likely have solar, wind or turbine powering their miners, so you will always have miners as long as people want crypto currency.
