Well, I can get into the bigger picture easily in the future when Bitcoin is actually useful to me, assuming the fees go down and useability is easier.  The reason for me to be in Bitcoin NOW is to make money.

I bought mine a few years ago.  Been holding just fine.

For me, there is no reason to use it as money vs other ways I have to pay that are easier and cheaper right now.  I think it is this way for most.

That all costs $75 around here.

I think I'd call it "mostly fine and it pays me to use it so whatever."
@_date: 2014-02-11 00:04:27
It also pays you to use it...usually about a $5 amazon card/month.

Now if only you could buy bitcoin with bing rewards credits.

Hold on...I know healthcare is expensive in the US, but mediocre?
I have a chronic illness and read a subreddit related to it.  Often advice is "oh, if that doctor isn't helping you, go find another one - doctors aren't all created equal."  This is advice assuming you are in the US.  Often the person will respond and say that's not an option because their government makes them fill out all kinds of forms to give reason to change their doctors.  Also, there are months long waits to get appointments.
I think the US healthcare is pretty screwed up, but I am thankful I have a choice of providers who can compete to be my doctor and there is no red tape for me to make a choice and move to a different one.

Like dollars via Square Cash? ;)

That's a very nice hat.

I freelance.  It's mostly checks in the mail.  So annoying when the client wants their video edited yesterday, but my contract says I don't deliver anything until I am paid in full.  After going through accounting and the mail, it's usually around 30 days before I see my money.  Then I have to drive to the bank because my bank doesn't do check deposit via phone app, and even if they did, they probably wouldn't support my WindowsPhone.
I make sure my subcontractors will accept Square Cash at least.  That goes smoothly.

Square cash is free.  Debit card to debit card transfers via emails.

Like, person 1 reaches in his pockets for dollars, hands the dollars to person 2, person 2 puts dollars in pocket?

My comment was that it is expensive in the US but you may have the opportunity to have options unlike in some other countries which is nice.  Your comment is just, "But it's expensive!"  Yes, I acknowledged that already.

My brother has a 2003 with maybe 60k on it.  He was a grad student living on campus for a bit, he was unemployed for a bit, he worked part time like 8 miles away for a bit, he got a job like 8 years ago and just drove 1 mile to the train station every day, and now he lives in the city and takes the metro to work. Now he's only in his car to drive 20 miles to visit my folks every other week.
It looks like it's got 150k on it because it's been parked outside and had plenty of people hit it with doors and things.  He can definitely afford something nice now but it's not really worth it for the amount of actual driving he does.

I think has a bunch of beginner info in the sidebar which should include Index funds.  I think you've got some learning to do before you dump the majority of your money into ANY investment.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:23:37
Dude, there are more options for investing than Bitcoin or a savings account.  Put some money into index funds.  Diversify.  80% of savings in Bitcoin is extremely risky.

My buddy works for PayPal and said that the ad has been on repeat in the lobby for a week and he is sick of it. Coworkers have been posting the ad on Facebook like they are pumped about it.
@_date: 2016-02-09 03:21:20
Nah he's just in support or something.
@_date: 2015-03-19 02:04:36
As far as I can tell this is basically Square Cash (sending money via debit card by copying cash in an email) but on facebook.  Square cash is dope.  It's how my roomates pay me the rent and I even use it for payment for freelance work occasionally.
