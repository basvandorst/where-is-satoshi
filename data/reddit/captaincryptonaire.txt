I understand that. This obviously depends on where you live, and I can only talk for Austrians here. I was recently at my tax consultant talking about cryptocurrency; to which he told me that there are several laws coming soon regarding this whole issue.
In my opinion, it is in everyone's best interest to consult with a tax consultant and get their feedback, no matter the amount.
Stay safe and be smart

Make sure you check up on your tax consultant or financial adviser. Overdrafting or loans to invest into cryptocurrency can lead to problems. That is currently the case in Austria...

My tax consultants mentioned that if I were to take a loan specifically for cryptocurrency, it could potentially lead to some problems. There is currently talks of a few more taxation's which could potentially be "rückwirkend" to 2017.

Number one rule: Read. Learn. Educate yourself.
This is a decision you must decide for yourself. Everyone in here, including me can only give advice based on our own experience and how we perceive the market.
My personal advice: NO. You should not invest your whole savings into Bitcoin. This is what happens what you become too confident or cocky. You become blind and do not see the big picture anymore. You see lots of potential and success, which leads to greed.
The reason you did not invest everything back then, is the same reason why you haven't done it yet. You never know what the future holds. You don't know what will happen with BTC, you don't know what will happen with Cryptocurrency and along with many other factors revolving around this theme.
Calculate a % of your savings to invest into BTC, but also invest into other markets / stocks. Spread your portfolio. It's a safe and secure way to increase your savings and live comfortably.
Be patient. Be smart.

Here are also some good and important points from Live Bitcoin Trading (YT Channel):
- Trading is hard. 90% of traders never manage to be consistently profitable. 
- Greed is your enemy. 
- A good trader is a good risk manager.
- Use Stop Loss and don't move them in the middle of a trade.
- The more leverage you use, the more certain you will fail.
- If you cant sleep at night, your positions are too big.
- You need to manage your emotions. Try meditation.
- You dont need to have positions open at all time.
- An average of 1% profit per week compounded will make you filthy rich.
- A good strategy is not the most important part of your success. Discipline is.
- Repeat this mantra: “I am a very good trader”

They are quite expensive. I will also have a talk at the WKO Finanzabteilung.
