The Lightning Network is a decentralized system for instant, high-volume micropayments that remove the risk of delegating custody of funds to trusted third parties.
The lightning network aims to solve the problem of non-confirmation of micropayments and high confirmation time of transactions. The network creates a payment channel between two peers. This channel is bound by rules and any transaction to occur in this channel will have to be signed by both the peers. The transaction within the network does not actually go to the main Blockchain. It is stored in the local ledger copies of both the peers. Rules are usually set to define a cutoff date after which the final state of transactions within the lightning network would go to the Blockchain.
Let’s take an example to understand this. Let’s say Alice has 10 BTC and Bob has 5 BTC when a channel was created between them. Now, Alice pays to Bob 1 BTC every day for 6 days. In the channel, there will be 6 transaction records in the local ledger copies of Alice and Bob. Now, when Alice and Bob decide to close the channel and commit the transaction to the Blockchain, there will only be 1 transaction indicating Alice paying 6 BTC to Bob.
You could see that since every transaction is not getting recorded on the main Blockchain, it is a lot quicker and **scales** a lot better than the Bitcoin Blockchain. Please note that this is still a concept and not yet applied on the Bitcoin Blockchain.

Blockchain as a technology is very new to trust your knowledge to web pages or resources that come unrecommended. There are various Blockchain tutorials available online, but it is very important that you choose the right one. I have myself come across resources that explain nuanced aspects of the concept wrongly. For example, in one of the episodes of the popular podcast [Let’s Talk Crypto]( one of the suggested ways of keeping your cryptocurrency safe is committing your private key to memory. We believe that’s risky and not advisable at all. How many web resources we have seen that do a really confusing job of proof of Work vs. Proof of Stake!  Choose your blockchain course or certification wisely. Check out Blockchain Semantics, especially if you are a professional.

I would try to explain Blockchain in the simplest way I can.
Let us assume that there are two people John and Leo. John borrows some money from Leo and Leo writes it on a piece of paper signed by John. After some days John denies the existence of such document and claims that Leo has forged that piece of paper. Leo would now find it difficult to prove that John actually owes him Money.
In this example, John and Leo are two nodes.
Now assume the same scenario, but among a society. So there is ’k’ pair of people transacting with each other. And the only proof that each pair has, is that piece of paper. Looking at this scenario, one person, Ella comes up with a solution. She suggests maintaining a common notebook of the transaction for the entire society. She designates town hall to be the place where every exchange takes place. In the common notebook, every pair writes the transaction and then the notebook is kept safely. People rejoice and accept Ella as their leader.
That notebook can be called a database.
 But one day, somebody spills wine on the notebook. This makes the notebook illegible. Taking the advantage of this situation, John again denies taking money from Leo.
This is the problem databases face - a single point of failure.
 Irritated by this problem, Ella comes up with another solution. She suggests maintaining multiple notebooks. She chooses some trustworthy people from the society and gives them a notebook each. Now every time a transaction or exchange takes place between two people, Ella instructs some of those trustworthy people to mention the transaction in their notebooks. So the data is repeated in the notebooks. Now, even if one notebook is destroyed, chances are that all the data regarding transactions are still present in the combination of other notebooks.
This is a distributed database and multiple notebooks are the multiple nodes.
 But next day, another problem arises. Ella has a friend named Roy who owes a lot of money to some people in the society. He asks Ella for help and she agrees to help him. She instructs all the people with the notebooks to remove the entries where Roy received money. Now Roy doesn’t owe any money based on the notebooks.
This is the problem with distributed databases - they are centralized. That means one single entity owns all the nodes/resources and can make changes as they deem fit.
 When the people from the society come to know of it, they remove Ella from the leadership.
• They decide to keep a notebook each. Every time a transaction is made between any two people, all the people from the town come together and mention it in their respective notebooks. So if there are n people in the society, then there are n notebooks and no one person controls the overall representation of the transactions.This is decentralization.
 • They also decide to never remove or delete an already mentioned transaction from the notebook. This is immutability.
 • Now when another group of people from the society, let’s call them C, try to change a record in their notebooks, all the other people also need to make the same change(as mentioned in the first point above, all the people write all the transactions in their notebooks). Before writing the transaction proposed by group C, all the other people notice that the transaction is not correct. So they come to realize that C is trying to make a fraudulent transaction. Hence they deny that transaction and not mention it in their notebooks. They also decide to banish the group C from further participating in the group. This is how Consensus is formed and voting is done to decide the validity of a transaction in Blockchain.
 • A very enthusiastic kid suggested that the transactions form a chain, so they decided to call the collective set of fully replicated, decentralized, immutable notebooks as Blockchain.
 So, well. This is the easiest example I can think of to explain Blockchain. The Blockchain is a **decentralized**, **peer to peer**, **immutable** storage network which is censor free and regulator free because of the absence of one single controlling entity. Every transaction that is written is voted upon by a majority of nodes and changing something which was written before in the chain is computationally very difficult.

We have been hearing the word Blockchain for a while now. Blockchain is not just the technology behind Bitcoin. Blockchain is a paradigm shift in the way the world will think of and use technology. Blockchain technology offers a massive shift from the current transaction and record-keeping mechanisms and can be thought of as a foundation for disruptive digital businesses, for both startups and established enterprises.
Blockchain allows untrusted entities (both human and nonhuman) to undertake commercial transactions and exchange value with a diverse range of assets with the system itself bringing trust.
The ability of blockchain to provide information transparency and immutability, the potential for smart contracts, and the opportunity to create new business models should force business heads to review the fundamental aspects of their business with respect to Blockchain.
According to Gartner Trend Insight,
 
•	By 2022, at least one innovative business built on blockchain technology will be worth $10 billion.
•	By 2025, the business value added by blockchain will grow to slightly over $176 billion, then surge to exceed $3.1 trillion by 2030
 
Blockchains features like immutability, privacy, trust, reliability makes this technology suitable for every industry. You pick any industry, Blockchain is going to be a relevant conversation to have today.

Forking implies any divergence in Blockchain- temporary or permanent. Very simply, forking is said to happen when a Blockchain splits into two branches. It can happen as a result of a change in consensus algorithm or other software changes. Depending on the nature of change, the fork can be categorized into Hard Fork and Soft Fork. Keep calm and read below! 
**Hard Fork**
A hard fork is a permanent divergence from the previous version of the Blockchain, and nodes running previous versions will no longer be accepted by the newest version. A hard fork is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously valid blocks or transactions invalid. Any transaction on the forked (newer) chain will not be valid on the older chain. All nodes and miners will have to upgrade to the latest version of the protocol software if they wish to be on the new forked chain. This essentially creates a fork in the Blockchain, one path which follows the new, upgraded Blockchain, and one path which continues along the old path. 
Hard Fork is usually done only when there is enough support from the mining community. Only when the majority of miners give positive signal towards the upgrade or fork, the developers of the chain starts work on the upgraded code. Typically, the support should come from 90 to 95 percent of the miners. 
**Soft Fork**
A soft fork is said to happen when a change to the software protocol keeps it backward compatible. What this means is that the new forked chain will follow the new rules and will also honor the old rules. The original chain will continue to follow the old rules. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules, as opposed to a hard fork which requires (almost) all nodes to upgrade and agree on the new version. 
New transaction types can often be added as soft forks, requiring only that the participants for e.g. sender and receiver and miners understand the new transaction type. This is done by having the new transaction appear to older clients as a "pay-to-anybody" transaction (of a special form) and getting the miners to agree to reject blocks including this transaction unless the transaction validates under the new rules. This is how to pay to script hash (P2SH) was added to Bitcoin. 
A soft fork can also occur at times due to a temporary divergence in the Blockchain when miners using non-upgraded nodes violate a new consensus rule their nodes don’t know about.
