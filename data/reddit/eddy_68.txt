I have tested your website, bad, good and good news.
**First the bad news:**
- When I use my Eclair wallet, for 50 spins, I always have a failed. I tried this afternoon, and now a few seconds ago. 
- The error msg is: *payment fee was below the minimum required by the channel*. I believe the problem is at Eclair wallet level.
**Good news 1:**
- I changed to my LN wallet, and payment for 50 spins, worked fine. In seconds.
**Good news 2:**
- I won some Shatoshi, and requested a cash out. Worked fine, I received the payments in seconds on my LN wallet.
1 Remark:
- my total Saldo was something around 79 spins.
- To create the invoice, I needed to calculate the value, in Sathosi for 79 spins. 
- I knew the price what i payed for 50 spins, so it was easy to calculate the price for 75. 
- It was easier, if I can see the value of my spins in Sathosi, than I don't have to calculate. Or maybe you have it somewhere on the website, but I don't have seen it.

You can pay much more than 0.001, but you decided than that 0.001 is the Max transaction limit.
Imagine, you have funded 0.001 BTC and send me 0.0005 BTC.
When i receive them, i send 0.0005 back to you
than you can send again to me
and i back to you
And we can do that 10/100/1000 times. You spend than much more than your initial 0.001 BTC.

Using crypto is so easy as sending an email with an attachment.
The first time, it's little bit looking out for the options, but then, very easy.
And for your first email, you also have to learn about email addresses, inbox, outbox, and the buttons send and receive. And if you understood that, you are the expert when you can send an attachment. 
Doing a bitcoin payment is just scanning a QR code. 
Only what can be confusing is, buying your first coins, and move them to your wallet. 
But why it's difficult, because we have learned that banks do all for us. That it's too dangerous if we take our own finance in our own hands. Banks gave us the idea, we can not do it, and that we must be happy, that we pay bankers for doing it for us, and that they decide how and when we can spend our own money.
We have learned, just use plastic, and we have given or freedom of payments to the bankers.
And I think, if you wish to try, people will help you.
If you have problems, I, and others, always will try to help you.
Feel free to ask.
Maybe we can do a step by step guide?

There are already some exchanges what use LN.
MercuriEX, Bitbargain, BTCDuke, and Vaultoro.
For me personal, LN is used for making, in seconds, anonymous, small, purchases, with no record on the block chain.
Receiving on LN is a nice option. 
For higher value transactions, or I wish on-chain record, I use the standard bitcoin wallet/transactions integrated in the LN wallet.

I wish to mention that Russia has a lot of influence in the crypto community. 
From the article:
Russians are all over this space. They are in Silicon Valley on special visas, or zipping in and out of the Bay Area on tourist visas working on projects with Americans. They are in Singapore and Barcelona. They are founders and top advisors, one and all.
As of late last year, 20% of the top 50 blockchain startups by funds raised were Russian. They were either founded solely by Russians or had Russian partners, according to angel investor Elena Masolova. 
The Russians (including Russian-Americans and expats) building blockchain companies include guys like Aleksander Ivanov, founder of the Waves Platform; Vasiliy Suvorov, a senior executive at Luxoft and one of the founders behind the Crypto Valley Association being built in Switzerland; Alex Fork, CEO of fintech firm Humaniq; Alex Fedoseev, CEO of 1World Online; Siberian-turned-Australian Sergei Sergienko, the CEO of ChronoBank; Igor Barinov, the blockchain priest at POA Network in San Francisco; and Sergei Ponomarev, CEO of SONM, to name a few.
According to the Unified State Register of Legal Entities in Russia, there were 50 companies registered as blockchain technology firms at the start of the year. Their values range from zero to one billion rubles.
New comers are sprouting up all the time. Some stay close to home. Others think globally.

Problem is the script.
No idea how to do that. 
But theoretical it's possible that there is a programmer, who can create a little program, with GUI, for Windows/Android, what can do that?
A button: create new "friend"
A list with all the registered friends
And then an overview of the payments, and if LN okay, a button "create new invoices"  and send to their email? 
Details are now not so important.

I know, we call it "idiot proof".
But you can not use the length from my explication to qualify the quality from the product.
But I can try again, much shorter now:
Every LN channel, have a Max funding value, a value decided by yourself. Take the sum from all these Max Funding Values, from all the channels, and you have the Max Channell value.
Now much better?
@_date: 2018-09-28 12:11:46
That is good news.
If I understand correctly, my wallet can pay every other address, segwit or standard.
@_date: 2018-09-03 14:00:22
Of course, now here most of the time Monero or Dash. Before more Zcash.
Monero, on android, was nothing practical. Now with Monerujo much better, but not ideal.
But I believe Lightning Routing have the best from both worlds, speed and anonymity. And the wallets work fine.
Of course, LN Routing not perfect for large amounts.

I care about my meetings and that I will try to pay hotel and restaurants and bars with bitcoin.
I give extra information so that everybody knows what I wish to do with my wallet. 
In my opinion, it was no problem if my wallet use segwit and the hotel or restaurant or bar use not segwit.
Now I have learned, that it always can be possible, that when I wish to pay a restaurant or hotel, I can have an error, invalid address.
And because I mention hotel, restaurant, bar, other people who maybe plan for do the same, now also know that you always need enough money in fiat for pay the bill.
There is always the possibility, that the transaction is not possible.
And the invalid transaction was new for me.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:57:48
For information, both my wallets, Eclair and LN Wallet, use a channel to ACINQ.
I have no direct channel to the website.
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:42:43
But that is the basic understanding from crypto currency, use the coin what is the best for your current transaction.
For me, very positive is LN Routing. It is in seconds, and you have anonymity, no record on the block chain.
But I decide, I need a record on the block chain, for ever and ever, and visible for everyone. Or I like more privacy.
If I wish to buy weed, and use BCH, or BTC, or other block chain coin, the transaction is visible for every body, and stay for ever on the chain.
If i decide than for use LN Routing, the transaction is ofchain, and, for the network, completely anonymous.
Imagine I tipp you BCH, or BTC, or ... I can follow al what happends with the coins. You go to a website, and use it for pay porn, everybody can see that. (If i can make a link between the addres you pay for and the porn website)

I can follow your thinking in Satoshis, but what I miss, is then a 1.000 separator.
On my Samourai Wallet, I have now 0.1379 BTC.
That is easy to read, and easy, if necessary, in my mind, to convert to Thai Baht, Euro, or US$.
But when I change to Satoshis view, I have 13790000 sat.
With a first fast look, I have no idea of the value, I have to count the digits.
It is much easier if it was written like 13.790.000, using 1000 separators
Then I can directly see I have 13 million 790 thousands sat
@_date: 2018-09-28 11:24:42
Using another wallet is the next option.
But I prefer that bx know the problem and hopefully will fix it.
Back to the basic from the problem:
Your answer implements that there is only a transaction between segwit and standard bitcoin address if the wallet/exchange/Payment service provider does an "upgrade".
If not, then there is no transaction possible?
When I wish to pay with my segwit address, I also can have a problem for pay the merchant, if his exchange/wallet did not upgrade?

If I remember correctly:
Some time ago, 3-4 months ago, BCH members did a test with wallets on smartphone and o-confirmations.
For them, it was possible to accept a 0-confirmation, and directly resend the value/coins to another address.
They posted a small clip from the demonstrations.
And they made a proof that 0-confirmation, to 0-confirmation, to 0-confirmation worked.
For them, it was a major feature from BCH, that you instantly can transfer the coins what you "receive" with 0 confirmations.
But I forgot where I have seen the test.
Someone Else remember this? Or is my brain playing with me?

@_date: 2018-09-03 12:24:53
I will try to explain.
Imagine you and me wish to use lightning.
We both have an android phone, and we both use LN wallet for android. 
The lightning network is based on Channels.
Your wallet is connected with a channel to a node.
My wallet is connected with a channel to a node.
And the nodes have channels to other wallets or to other nodes.
When we do a transaction, we use the channels and the nodes for reach the destination.
The first time, when you set up a channel, you have to fund that channel. You decide the Max capacity from that channel.
For example, you decide, you fund your channel with 0.010 BTC.
Your channel has then 3 important parameters:
- Max funding/Capacity: here 0.010 BTC
- Can send: now 0.010 BTC, you can pay 0.010 BTC
- Can receive: = Max funding - Can send = 0.010 - 0.010 = 0 BTC
Now you go to a pub and have a drink. You pay 0.002 BTC.
The parameters adapt:
- Max funding/Capacity: 0.010 BTC **this stays always the same**
- Can send: 0.010 - 0.002 = 0.008 BTC
- Can receive: 0.010 - 0.008 = 0.002 BTC
Now I send you 0.001 BTC, and parameters adapt again:
- Max funding/Capacity: 0.010 BTC **this stays always the same**
- Can send: 0.008 + 0.001 = 0.009 BTC
- Can receive: 0.010 - 0.009 = 0.001 BTC
You go back to the pub, and have few drinks, You pay 0.005 BTC.
- Max funding/Capacity: 0.010 BTC **this stays always the same**
- Can send: 0.009 - 0.005  = 0.004 BTC
- Can receive: 0.010 - 0.004 = 0.006 BTC
And so on.
**The netwerk capacity, is now the sum, from all the channels, their Max Capacity or funding. In this example, for your channel, the value will be 0.010 BTC.**
It's a nice indication how the network grows. But that is all.
In a channel, take our channel with a capacity from 0.010 BTC, we can do 10/100/1000 transactions.
Edit: for be correct, our channels, because they can not be used for routing, are not in the list from channels on LN.

Lightning Wallet for android.

Thanks for clear that out for me.
I remember the first days with creditcards, in the BENELUX, and restaurants.
Even when there was a large sticker on the door, you never knew if they accepted the credit card, and you always needed cash as back-up. 
And my first idea, oh my goth, not again. Don't start with invalid address and I can not use my wallet.
I have an answer from the exchange.
**We are sorry but the address must begin with the number 3 only.**
@_date: 2018-09-03 13:00:27
Yes and no.
When you use Lightning wallet, you can see it like you have 2 addresses/wallets.
You have a standard bitcoin address/wallet, for standard transactions on the block chain.
And you have your Lightning Channel(s).
For do a transaction, you can chose out 3 possibilities:
- Standard bitcoin transaction
- you create a direct channel to your friend/merchant
- you connect your wallet to a node, and you use Lightning routing.
If you wish now to receive a large sum, you best take a standard bitcoin transaction. You just give your LN wallet bitcoin address.
If you wish to use Lightning, correct, you can not receive more than your initial funding - your spending.
And be careful, you also have the Eclair wallet, and this wallet is created for send/receive standard bitcoin, but only send LN transactions.
LN wallet, send/receive standard bitcoin, send/receive LN
Eclair wallet, send/receive standard bitcoin, send LN

I think you forget how smart Average Joe can be.
When I'm in Europe, the people think that the USA is the most stupid country in the world. That the people there only know 1 country, 1 language, and can not count, are extremely fat, and sit all the day before tv, watching soaps.
Ask them to point at Africa on a world map, they have no idea where Africa is. 
Ask them the result from 183 - 25, they have no idea. 
Because they can not count, they only can swap their plastic card.
People in Europe also laugh with all the stupid safety warnings, specific for the USA. Like, don't use a microwave for dry your cat.
When I am in Asia, same story but then about Europeans. Group of alcoholics and sex maniacs. They also never will understand how to use a crypto wallet. Here you have than a lot of respect for the USA.
**If you also believe, average Joe in every other country, or in your own country, is so stupid, then I understand your thinking, crypto will never work.**
**But I believe, average joe is smart enough for use crypto. All the ideas from average Joe is very stupid are based on prejudices**
My parents are 70+. 3 Years ago, we don't need internet, never used PC or Table. Than I bought them an android tablet, paid internet connection in their home. 
After 1 year, every day on the internet, emails with attachments, surfing, chatting, and searching for information. They even installed a bitcoin wallet. 
And they understand very well, from the viewpoint from a customer, not technicus, how a LN channel works. 
They have no idea from payment channels or submarine swab.
But they understand, if I fund with 1 BTC, I can spend 1 BTC, and only have to scan QR code.

If I have to pay you 5k in 5 days:
- If I open today the channel, 5 days before the payment, you already know that I have the 5k, and I show good intention to send them to you.
- I can also wait until day 5. Opening from the channel and funding it, is a standard bitcoin transaction. Takes Max 2 Hr before the channel is created.
But the beauty from LN is that when you have an open channel, you can do 10/100/1000 transactions with a minimal fee.
Imagine, you work for me, you create a project, and my budget is 5k. We can sit than together and select some important steps in the project.
And Imagine that you are a very poor person or new start-up with little bit of money.
Practical, you design a new logo for my company.
Step 1: The first meeting. If we come to an agreement that we work together, I can inform the Financial department to open a 5k LN channel to you, and I already can order to do a payment from 1k.
You know, I have the budget, and I know, if you deliver a bad quality product, I only will lose the first payment.
Step 2: draft model: if accepted, I pay you 1k.
step 3: My new logo is almost ready, I pay you 1 k
step 4: delivery of the goods, I pay you 2 k 
If you are a poor person, you don't need the money to create a complete working product. In the production process, I can already pay, very easy, some parts from the total price.

Money Supply, yeah, I like the idea, but then only when your wallet only can pay on LN, and can not receive.
If the wallet can send and receive, the value from all the transactions in the channel, can be much higher than this number, money supply.
**LN wallet only can receive:**
Here I follow you, the term "money supply" is correct. 
I think then about a small purse with some coins for little expenses. Is the purse empty, I have to refill. 
Imagine you fund the channel with 0.010 BTC, and your wallet only can pay, not receive, using Lightning.
Your channel parameters wil be:
- capacity : 0.010 BTC
- can send/pay : 0.010 BTC
Now you spend 0.001 BTC
- capacity: 0.010 BTC
- can send: 0.009 BTC
Now you spend 0.003 BTC
- Capacity: 0.010 BTC
- can send: 0.006 BTC
And so on, till your "can send" value is 0. If it's 0, you have to close the channel and open a new one. 
(For be 100% correct, you always have to pay a minimal fee. Your channel cannot go completely to 0, the minimum value is 0 + "calculated fee for close the channel". Your wallet does all these calculations.)
**Now your wallet can send and receive on LN:**
Imagine you fund the channel with 0.010 BTC.
Your channel parameters wil be:
- capacity: 0.010 BTC
- can send/pay: 0.010 BTC
- can receive: 0.000 BTC.
Now you spend 0.009 BTC 
 
- Capacity: 0.010 BTC
- can send: 0.001 BTC
- can receive: 0.009 BTC
I send you 0.008 BTC, and your wallet update
- Capacity: 0.010
- Can send: 0.009
- can receice: 0.001
You pay 0.005 BTC
- Capacity: 0.010
- can send: 0.004
- can receive: 0.006
You receive 0.003
- capacity: 0.010
- can send: 0.007
- can receive: 0.003
And so on.
**Term money supply**
If the channel can send and receive on LN, the term money supply, not really correct. Because the value of the transactions in the channel, can be much higher than capacity/money supply.
For me personal, I like the term money supply. 
Why, because Lightning was originally created to make small payments, in seconds. Payments what don't need a record on the blockchain. Like the cup of coffee, newspaper, sandwich, .... 
And when you compare LN than with a small purse, money supply sounds good.

Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.
See the LN wallet like a wallet for pay little expenses.
You put 0.010 BTC in your LN wallet and you use LN to pay for your coffee, newspaper, sandwich, buy a steam game, ...
And the eclair wallet is now, till today, completely based on this system. Use standard bitcoin for send/receive what you like, with a record on the block chain, use LN for pay small amounts, no record on the block chain.
Don't forget, you still have standard bitcoin, you can send and receive how much you wish.
But you have than LN wallet, and now also Spark, where you can use standard on-chain bitcoin transactions, but you also can send/receive off-chain LN transactions.
Edit: is your wallet empty, with eclair, you open a new channel. With LN wallet, you refill your channel, send money to it.

Very easy, Bitcoin has to give something to the people, what they now don't have.
Now they have cash, plastic and super fast electronic transactions in seconds, and they really trust the bank infrastructure and organizations.
**What is missing here, that is anonymity and complete control of your money** 
To make a bitcoin a success, you need the same values what already exist:
- Trust in the system
- Supper fast transactions
and add
- Anonymity.
- Total control of your coins
And I believe, bitcoin in combination with Lightning routing can give that.

This reminds me of the same discussions in Europe, before and after the Euro.
Before the Euro, every European country had its own currency. The French Frank, the German Mark, the Spanish Peseta, The Italian Lira and so on.
After the introduction from the Euro, a lot of people asked for keep a Doubble price identification. The price in Euro, and the price in ex-local-currency.
The arguments are the same. 
Pro double price identification was/is that the people can not calculate in Euro.
Anti-double identification was that the people, when you let them think in the old currency, never will understand a value, if the value is only expressed in Euro. The first months will be difficult, but after some time, people will understand the value in Euro.
Replace Euro by Bitcoin/Sathosi and national currency with US$ and you have the same discussion.
I also have problems when I see prices in Sathosi or only bitcoin, but slowly on I learn to think more and more in bitcoin value.
And only give the bitcoin value, can be a good tool, if you wish to understand directly the value from bitcoins.
But like the National currencies and Euro, older people, in Europe, still think in the national currency. They convert the Euro to French Frank or Italian Lira, to understand the value. 
And then they hate the Euro. They will say, before the euro a bread was 2 French frank, and now almost 3 Euro, 6 French Frank. The false argument, the Euro makes life much more expensive. 
But you also have the same discussion, why Samourai don't use Euro, or Thai Baht, or ...
When I pay here in Thailand, the only better way for me will be a direct price identification in Thai Baht. 
Even when it's in US$, I have to convert to Thai Baht, or Euro, to see directly the value.

Steam games:
You have now joltfun, where you can buy directly Steam games with bitcoin or Lightning.
For me, living in Asia, when I compare with my official steam account:
- some games on joltfun are much cheaper than using my official steam account
- some games are the same price
- some games are more expensive on Joltfun.
I will advice you than, if you use Android, for install a wallet what can use Lightning.
You can chose between Eclair or LN wallet.
Major difference, with Eclair you can pay and receive standard bitcoin, but you only can pay using LN.
With LN wallet, you can pay and receive standard and LN transactions.
If you can not find a cheaper price on Joltfun, than you always can use the same wallets for buy steam vouchers on bitrefill.

"You have to keep track of your wallet spending of the past 5 years" that is completely new for me.
The European lawyers in my crypto-friends-group stated: "so long I keep the private key from my wallet, and don't share it with a 3the party, my funds are out of scope of the AML/CFT regulation"
If a third-party have the private key from my wallet, than you must follow AML/CFT rules. 
Practical: when you have a wallet, where you have the private key, like Jaxx, Eclair, or Hardware wallet like Ledger, you are out of the scope.
But when you use Coinbase, or other exchange, they have to follow the AML/CFT regulations.
I did not know that the AML/CFT regulation was changed, so that every one who have a wallet, is now a subject.
Can I have the official link for these European Laws?
This is huge news!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
The impact is enormous. If I wish to test a crypto wallet on my phone or PC, I must keep it for  5 years? Now I Install, test, and remove the app. Lost all the tracks from my old wallets.

The Euro is a good example why it will be very difficult for a crypto to replace FIAT.
Before the Euro, every country in Europe had his own FIAT.
When you lived in Belgium, very small country, surrounded by Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg and France.
It was common that in a Belgian wallet/home you found, Belgian Frank, Dutch Gulden, German Mark and French Franc.
It was possible, for example, pay in the Netherlands with Belgian Frank, but the exchange rate was very bad. In real life, in a bank, 1 gulden was 15 Belgian Frank. In a shop in the Netherlands, they calculated, 1 gulden is 18 to 20 Belgian Frank. 
Al these exchange rates made it difficult to shop in a other country. 
And that's 1 of the reason why you have now the Euro. 
Most of the European countries use now the Euro, no exchange rate. 1 Euro in Belgium is the same as 1 Euro in Netherlands, or France, or Germany, or Spain, and so on. 
Asking a merchant for accept crypto, is like going back in time, and you need again several kinds of currency.
Shop A accept Euro, Shop B accept Euro/BTC, shop C accept Euro/BCH, Shop D accept Euro/Monero. 
And when you use crypto, you have pay to a fee, so you pay more than when you use FIAT. 
Don't forget, the European law say that every official merchant must accept Euro. And that make that, the most easy payment system, now in Europe, is the Euro/FIAT. Everybody have it, is every where accepted, and the gov and banks love it.
And than come some nerds, who will try to convince you, for replace FIAT with crypto? Wallets, Mining, Exchanges, fees, what is that? 
Crypto, and which one?
BTC, the BCH community will do everything for convince the world BTC is bad, LN will never work, so better don't use it. You must be crazy for use BTC.
Than use BCH, but BCH also don't work, Roger Ver as symbol for payments in Europe, the finger, babies die. And in the French speaking European Regions, paying with penises?
European government will use every excuse for never replace Euro with Crypto.
The only way for let crypto replace FIAT is first, that, in the crypto community, people work together for bring back trust in crypto.
If even in the small crypto world, BCH fanboys always spread the news that BTC is dead, BTC is a hoax, never will work, than don't be surprised people outside this small group will believe this and refuse to invest in crypto.
Non technical people never will say, oh BTC is dead, I change to BCH.
When they believe you, they run away from crypto.
And than you believe that these people will be eager to replace their Euro's with Crypto? Forget it. 
What crypto need, bring back the trust in crypto to the common people. Talk about the pro's for every currency, stop the mud fight between BCH and BTC.
Talk about the pro's from your coin, why your coin is better, and not always destroy the other coin.
And if the trust is back, make a system that the people see the profit for using crypto. Cheaper price than FIAT, anonymity, faster international transactions. But let the people freely chose between BTC, BCH, Monero, ZCash, ….. 
Talk about the strength from your coin, not how bad the other coin is.

This site gives a nice update from lightning Network.
Number of open Mainnet Nodes: 2411.
Total of open Channels: 8912.
Total channel Capacity : BTC 21.78848171.
In my Opinion, the total number of open Mainnet Nodes is not so important, you need nodes with open channels.
. 
You have 609 nodes with 0 channels.
That makes than 2411 - 609= 1 802 Nodes.
The 8912 Channels are all channels what you can use for routing. For example, an Eclair channel from the app to a Node is not in this list.
Second important part, is the routing. In how many hops can you reach the complete network. At this time, for some nodes, you need Maximum 6 Hops for reach all the nodes. But most of the nodes do it in 4 hops, where 5 and 6 are an exception.

I think that you, or heise.de, make a mix from 2 different law regulations, and that the conclusion is wrong. 
My lawyer friends said that nothing is changed, you don't have to keep record from all your Wallets. The AMF/CFT regulation is not changed for personal wallets.
The tax regulations, in the European countries, state that, if you are subject for a tax "normal" investigation, the officials can go back for a period from, for most of the countries, 5 years.
This not mean, you, als individual, have to keep a track from your wallets for 5 years. You don't have to tell where you have spend every euro.

I use the Eclair wallet on my android phone.
After installation I directly opened a channel with ACINQ.
That channel is now a few weeks open and I can use it when the merchant accept Lightning. (Bitrefill)
If the merchant don't accept Lightning, I can use a blockchain transaction. 
Opening a channel is worth it.

That is a calculation what have no value.
The 100 Bitcoin is a Indication how the channels are funded, the sum of the max values from the all the channels.
Imagine I have a channel to you, funded with 0.100 Bitcoin. The 0.100 bitcoin, the Max value from the channel, you will find back the sum of all the channels, now the 100 Bitcoin.
But between you and me. we can do 100/1000/10000 transactions, with a Max from 0.100 Bitcoin.

In my opinion, you can put more transactions in the same block, but I don't understand how you come at "near infinite amount of transactions".
More transactions, if you have transactions with a lot of signatures, where you can replace all the signatures with a Schnorr signature.

There are no new investors, and a lot of old investors go back to FIAT. An investor need trust in the product. And the trust in crypto is declining. From december 2017, if you find a post about BTC, wait a few minutes, and you will see postings that BTC is dead, that LN never wil work, and that BTC is done. And if investors believe this, they remove their money. Not to an other crypto, but back to a safer location, FIAT. If the same investor search for BCH, he wil find, BCH is a sekte, like scientology, with their supreme leader, Ver. The finger, babies die, I'm selfmade super rich, not really a trustful person. Pornhub work together with Verge, than Verge must be ok. Also not true, the last months, Verge already 2 times successful attacked.

I think you don't clearly understand crypto currency.
I will use BTC/BCH, for example.
For spend easy coins, you will install a wallet on your phone.
You transfer your bitcoins to the wallet, and you can transfer now from your wallet, to an other persons wallet. Wallet to wallet, no 3the man.
Android wallets what can do that, Eclair, LN Wallet, Jaxx, Airbitz, Samourai, and so on.
But when you use standard Bitcoin or BitcoinCash, you have a anonymity problem. All your transactions will be forever on the block-chain and visible for the government. 
You can see which address have send to which address. It's not easy, but possible, for link your account to an address.
Better is than that you don't use standard bitcoin or BitcoinCash, but systems focused on anonymity. 
Think than about:
Bitcoin &amp; Lightning routing, with the Eclair and LN Wallets for android
Or Dash, Monero, Zcoin
For buy your coins, than you better go for a person to person deal.

In my world, between Millennials in Europe and Asia, this was true till the end of 2017.
Now a lot of Millennials remove their savings from Crypto. Reason, the stupid childish fights and mud throwing between Bitcoin and BitcoinCash.
If you believe BitcoinCash, Bitcoin is taken over, Lightning will never work, and Bitcoin will die. With other words, very bad for investment. If you read than about BitcoinCash, you can make the conclusion, "it's a dead born child". Read some more, and you will find "The finger", anger, narcisme, from their leader. That also give not the trust for invest your savings in BitcoinCash. If Ver was a bankmanager, who will trust his FIAT with him, if you see the figner, anger, narcisme?  Older people never accept that, for them a financial adviser must wear a nice suit, and must always be calm. Al the work what Andreas did, building up trust in crypto, is for Non-Technical Millennials, destroyed in a few months mud fight between BTC and BCH. And when BTC/BCH have no future, other coins will have the same problem, so better go away from crypto. I still believe in crypto, but I see a lot of older people remove their savings. And you can not blame them.

For me, the Eclair wallet on my phone is working fine. 1 Channel open to ACINQ. If I remember correctly, I have open the channel begin of April, an never have discover a problem.
I refill my wallet with a standard BTC transaction, not LN. My refill amount is most of the time higher than my channel value, even when I can receive via LN, it will be no option for my refill.

I will advise you for use Eclair. You can use Eclair for normal bitcoin transactions or LN transactions. When you scan a QR code, or paste a bitcoin address, Eclair will see if it's a LN or "normal" bitcoin address, and Eclair will chose the correct service. You can open a LN channel to ACINQ or scan/paste a node, or let the app select a random node. Cost for open a channel, few dollar cents. For me it was, begin April 2018, 0.04 US$. At the moment, you can not receive LN payments on your Eclair wallet, but you can receive or send standard bitcoin payments, phone to phone. Because you only can do LN payments, your phone, or app, don't have to be 24/24 7/7 online. When you open Eclair, the app will (re)synchronize the channel for you, and you can do your LN payment. If you chose an other wallet, take a wallet where you have control of the wallet. Not a wallet where you can login with username and password. The wallet minimum must create a (20) word list for the new Private key, and if possible, open source. Before Eclair, I used Airbitz. Before Airbitz, Jaxx on my phone and exodus on my pc. And I also follow the advice, that you speak with the shop owner, that he wil accept LN.  You have BTCPay and there is Strike from ACINQ.

Yes and no.
In Europe, politics did the same. Places sport star/actors/writers on the list, in the hope that they will attract votes.
And yes, the first time, that worked. But even when the celebrities did have enough votes, they almost never received a political function. And they very fast understood, they where abused, just used for get votes for the party.
And not longer, the voters also understood that.
When a political party, or organisation, or institution now use a sport star/actor/writer/famous person, in Europe, it will have opposite effect.
The people wil believe, the product have major problems, they need to pay a person, only for use his fame. Most of the time, the famous person even have no idea what he is promoting.
Reminds me about the time that famous cyclist promoted cigarettes.
For Europe, no
Here in Thailand it's different. Older people still can be influenced by famous people. The younger generation are smarter.
For Japan, I think same like Thailand. For the older generation, yes, for the younger, hmmm, no.

You have a few options, but I don't know if you can use them.
Option 1: Exchanges in combination with bank account
I have bank accounts in Europe and Thailand.
That makes it possible for me to uses exchanges based on Euro, like Coinbase/Bitstamp, to buy/sell crypto in Euro, or for Thai Baht, using bx.in.th or TDAX.
I can then easily use crypto for exchange between Euro and Thai Baht. Or vice versa.
This option is only a good idea if you often go to the same country, and that you can open a bank account in that country + that you can create an account on an exchange that uses the currency from that country.
Option 2: Person to person, this is an option that can be dangerous.
Here you buy crypto in your home country, and sell them person to person in the country that you visit. The problem here can be trust. Some people will try to cheat you.
Option 3: Try to find a Crypto Exchange in your home country what gives you a debit card. 
This card you can use at ATMs or pay directly in a shop. But problem here, you will have very high fees. 
Option 4: You use online tools like BISQ.
But here again the same problems. Or you do person to person transaction, or you need a bank account in the currency, what you like to receive.
For me, it's possible, for my Thai or European bank, to create a US$ dollar account. I can then accept US$ using Bisq.
Option 5: Cash to Cash
If you have no bank accounts, I think this is the best for you.

In Thailand, last week:
- Paid in a restaurant, Retox Group Pattaya, using Bitcoin.
- Used Lightning on Bitrefill for top up my phone
- Used Lightning on Joltfun for buy Steam Games. Some games are cheaper than my official Thai Steam account.
- Exchanged Euro to Thai Baht (Coinbase in Europe to BX in Thailand)
- Paid for Torguard.
Improvements based on my personal experience:
In all the restaurants that I visited, there is only 1 person, the manager or boss, who can create a QR code. If the manager or boss is not there, no QR code, and you have to pay in cash. The staff must be much better educated about accepting crypto. 
In 1 restaurant, the first waiter even did not know what Bitcoin is, and that they accept it. Needed to call the manager. But because the boss was not there, even the manager could not create a QR code.
If a merchant uses Bitpay, you need a wallet that is compatible with the Pitbay payment protocol. That I have learned the hard way. The restaurant uses Bitpay, and my wallets not compatible. Needed to pay in cash. And that was not a positive user experience, using crypto.
In my opinion, the merchant, or Bitpay, have to adapt to the crypto users. Not the users have to adapt to the merchants choice of payment app.

Your app don't need to know all the possible routes. The app only need to know how it can reach every destination.
Your computer don't have to know, every route, to every IP address, on the internet. But your PC knows how it can reach every IP address connected to the internet. 
For reach an IP address outside your own network, your PC send your data to the default router, and the default router do again the same. Practical, your pc only need to know the IP address from your router.
With LN, the designers from the app, on your phone, can chose what they like to do. 
If the LN network is relative small, you can implement that the app will calculate the best route for you. Eclair wallet uses this system.
Or you can help your app with an Lightning Olympus Server. Here the app outsource the route-calculation to the Olympus Server. The server does than the route calculation for you.  "Lightning  wallet app" use Olympus server.
But every system have the pro and contra.
Eclair : Your payments are anonymous, the app use tor-routing from app to destination and back.  But because the app does the route calculation, first connection can be little bit slower. And you can not accept Lightning payments. You can send and receive normal Bitcoin transactions.
Lightning Wallet: The Olympus server know al your transactions, and you lose a part from your anonymity. Here you can send, and receive lightning payment, because the server accept them for you. And of course you have standard send/receive bitcoin transactions.

If the coffee is than 3 Euro, I always wil pay 0.010 Bitcoin for my coffee. I can buy 100 coffee's for 300 Euro, using bitcoin.
If now 1 BTC = 3.000 Euro, for my 300 Euro I have now 0.1 Bitcoin, but I also wil pay 0.001 Bitcoin for my coffee. 
And here again, I can pay for 100 coffees with my 300 Euro, using bitcoin.

For accepting Bitcoin, you have 2 major systems.
System 1, you do wallet to wallet. This means, you and your client have an Bitcoin Wallet. There are a lot of wallets for PC or Phone. Your PC/Phone create a QR code, the customer scans the code with the app on his phone, and he click pay. 
For Lightning, you have to use an app, on your phone or PC, what accepts Lightning payments. Accepting Lightning payments on your phone, till now, only "Lightning wallet" does that.
System 2, as merchant, you use a payment provider what accepts bitcoin and Lightning. The payment provider will accept the payment for you, and, depends on the payment provider, send the coins, or FIAT, to you.
Bitcoin : Your client need a bitcoin wallet.
lightning : your client need a bitcoin wallet with Lightning.
A Lightning Bitcoin app also can do normal bitcoin transactions. The customer can decide what to use.

Yesterday I tested the Android Lightning wallet, and maybe if I describe what I have done, you will understand LN better.
1) Funding the wallet with a normal Bitcoin Transaction. I did a transfer from GDAX to my wallet from 0.005 Bitcoins. You see directly the transaction on your phone, but it take 3 confirmations before you can use the coins.
2) Opening from a channel:
- You can freely chose to which node you make a channel, but the wallet give advice for take ACINQ. And I have follow the advice.
- Specify the value for funding your channel. I toke all from my standard bitcoin, 0.005 BItcoin.
- You can chose a fee for create the channel. Creation will take again 3 confirmations.
After 3 confirmations your channel is ready for send LN, but you will have the msg, accepting will take little bit longer. Few minutes later, your channel also can accept/receive via LN.
3) Buying something with LN. Here I have chosen for top-up my phone on bitrefill. I go to the website from bitrefill, give my phone number, money for top-up, and select LN payment.
I use my standard channel on the phone, to ACINQ, I **don't** open a new channel.
In seconds payment finished and SMS that the phone have a top-up.
In detail, I used 200 Baht, was 0.00111 Bitcoin, fee was 0.000000121 BTC (0.01%)
4) My channel did an update:
- I started with 0.005 Bitcoin.
- After funding channel, that was 0.00499 Bitcoin, fee for opening channel was 0.00001 BTC.
- I payed 0.00111 BTC, for top-up my phone,  with fee from 0.000000121 BTC.
That give than for the channel : (I do fast without the fees, it's just for the global idea)
Capacity : 0.00499 BTC
Can send : 0.00388 BTC
Can Receive : 0.00111 BTC
5) Now I wish to receive BTC via LN.
I went to  for do a withdraw.
In my wallet I select make a LN invoice. 
I only have to give the amount, and if I wish, I can add a note/reminder. The invoice is valid for 48 Hr.
Copy paste to Moneni, and second later I have the BTC in my channel update. Again, I used my standard channel to ACINQ, I **don't** made a new channel to Moneni.
6) My Channel did again an update.
Capacity : the same
Can send : 0.00388 + transfer from Moneni
Can Receive : 0.00111 - transfer from Moneni
I hope this give you a better idea what you can do with LN.

I will try to explain how LN works.
First, take a normal bitcoin transaction, wallet to wallet. Imagine you buy a beer in a bar and pay with bitcoin.
The transaction order is: your wallet - mining - bar wallet.
Mining is checking of the transaction is valid, and if yes, place it on the blockchain.
For every transaction you have the mining. If you drink 6 beers, you have 6 mining procedures and 6 transactions on the block chain.
For lightning, very important, LN is created for small, recurrent transactions.
The idea is, must every transaction be mined and placed on the blockchain? If you pay for a beer, must that be registered for forever on the blockchain? If you say no, than you can select on your app, use LN. But you always can decide, use standard bitcoin transaction.
How Ln works. 
Imagine, you have android and decided for use the Eclair wallet from ACINQ. You install the Eclair wallet on your android phone. And you open a channel to ACINQ, the organisation behind Eclair, or a channel to a other node. Or a channel to ACINQ, and channel(s) to other node(s).
You fund that channel with 0.010 BTC. 
This funding transaction is registered on the blockchain. Opening from the channel take a 20 mins.
You go to the bar, and order a beer. Take price from the beer is 0.001 BTC.
When you pay with LN, the app make and LN transaction, and starts with share the funding from the channel. First it wass 0.010 BTC for you, now the new transaction is 0.009 BTC for you, and 0.001 BTC for the bar. But there is no mining, no registration on the blockchain. The transaction is between you and the bar.
And you order again a beer. The app make a new LN transaction, 0.008 BTC for you, 0.002 BTC for the bar.
And why not, we take again a beer. New LN transaction, 0.007 BTC for you, and 0.003 BTC for the bar.
And so on. You can do 10/100/1000 transactions, and there is no registration on the blockchain.
Now, you and the bar decide for close the channel. And imagine, the latest transaction was 0.00001 for you, and 0.09999 for the bar. 
This closing transaction will be mined and written on the blockchain.
Standard bitcoin transaction : every transaction is mined and written on the blockchain. 10 transactions, 10 mining procedures and entries on the blockchain.
LN : Only the opening and closing transaction are mined and written on the blockchain. Between the opening and closing transaction, you can have 10/100/1000/10000 … transaction, without mining, and not registered on the blockchain.
10 Transactions, only 2 transactions, opening and closing from the channel, are mined/registered on the blockchain. 
My channel to ACINQ is open from begin April 2018.
You don't need a channel to every merchant. If you are connecting to the bar, and your friend is connected to bar, you can use your route to the bar for pay your friend. This is LN routing.

Why directly so aggressive?
Maybe in your world people come on board, in my world, the people what use their life savings, they go away.
I have seen thousands of Euro, or Ten thousands of Baht, go back to FIAT.
Maybe that here and there a new student comes for play with crypto. But these little players are than most of the time technical people, they will not make the exchange go to the moon.
And when you wish to use BTC in daily life, exchange is not so important. 1 BTC = 1 BTC.
BTW, I transfer every month my Euro income to crypto, and when needed, to thai baht. And I also teach people how to have better exchange rate when you use crypto.
But even here, people fall again back to international bank transfer. To scared for what happens when they wait for crypto transactions.

For be correct, it's outsourcing the route calculation to Olympus.
Advantage : You can accept Lightning payments on your wallet, and they can backup, protect your transactions, and your app is much lighter.
What you have to consider : You outsource the route calculation to Olympus server, and they ask a very small fee for it.

Correct me if I am wrong.
Imagine you wish to open a Multi-sig address, value 0.010 BTC.
I think you have 3 major systems for fund the address:
1) I fund that address with 0.010 BTC, the other side 0 BTC. (100% for me)
2) The other side fund that address with 0.010 BTC and I fund 0 BTC (100% for other side)
3) We split the funding. Take 50/50, Other side an I fund with 0.005 BTC.
If I am correct, and we decide system Nr 2, I fund 0 BTC, and the other side funds 100%, take again 0.010 BTC.
I think, the person/organisation who have fund 0 BTC in the address, can spend from this channel, so I use BTC what I don't have. 
Or sytem 3, I take 30% from the funding, other side 70%. I think I can spend more than  30%. So I can use BTC what I don't have.
Or am  I completely wrong?

Yeah, I can believe these headaches.

It's easy, look at the history from LN in this (BCH) sub.
- 1) LN routing wil never work. Hundreds of posts, or YouTube videos, even from Rick.
- 2) Routing works, but you only can use it for 20 US$.
- 3) Routing works, but you only can use it for 70 US$.
- 4) Routing works, but you only can use it for 300 US$.
I think 300 US was the last, or is it already under 700 US$ it can not work?
But you always can try again, routing not work. But even in BCH community the ideas changed.

You have at this moment 2 important Android wallets.
First one is Eclair, from ACINQ. You have standard bitcoin send  and receive, and Lightning payment. No receive on Lightning. I have a channel open with ACINQ from begin april 2018, and all payments work fine.
Second is "Bitcoin Lightning Wallet" from Anton kumaigorodski, based on the code from Eclair. Here you can send and receive with Lightning.
Major Difference: 
Eclair does the routing on the phone, and that's why you, till now, can not receive via Lightning. Of course you can receive standard bitcoin transactions.
Lightning Wallet outsource the routing to Olympus servers. That make it possible to accept LN payments. 
For merchant side, you have several solutions for accept Lightning.
Specific the routing part, the routing works fine.
This website gives the list from LN Mainnet nodes.
You have 2495 Nodes, 9060 open Channels. (Only full bi-directional working channels, the only-receive channels, example eclair wallet, are not in the list.)
For reach every other node, there is a Maximum from 6 hops. 
Here and there you have a Lightning payment problem. But this is most of time with a new merchant, who do a personal node setup and his first node setup need some extra channel updates. 
When you outsource the Lightning payment, all works fine,
If you need all the technical details, 
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:20:39
This is more in detail:
What does Olympus server do:
Lightning Wallet is mostly autonomous but there is also a special server called Olympus which helps it with general maintenance tasks.
Note: the wallet does not depend on or ever shares any personally identifying information with Olympus and is designed to work perfectly fine even when the Olympus server goes offline for an indeterminate periods of time.
Here is what Olympus server does:
It collects and provides an aggregate fiat prices (by periodially polling a number of well-known exchanges), as well as the current on-chain transaction fee rate.
Maintains a list of public Lightning nodes which the wallet uses to open payment channels.
 Note: Olympus only provides node information - all payment channel management (including opening and closing of channels) is done entirely by the Lightning Wallet in a completely autonomous manner.
Provides partial payment routes by traversing a Lightning Network graph. This relieves the wallet of some of the burden of maintaining such a graph locally, which may quickly become computationally infeasible for a mobile phone app.
 however this also introduces privacy implications which need clarifications:
Wallet always asks for a partial route which starts at your peer’s node.
 This provides a plausible deniability since peers typically have many different wallets connected to them so there is no way for Olympus to tell for sure who exactly is asking for a route.
Wallet knows when a payment is being sent directly to your peer and does not ask Olympus for a payment route in this special case.
Wallet caches successful routes so typically it only asks Olympus for a route once and then reuses it locally for subsequent payments.
Recipient may insert an assisted route right into its payment request and wallet is smart enough to detect that. 
Here is an example: suppose a complete route is A (you) → B (peer) → C → D → E (payee), in case when payee adds an assisted D → E route into it’s payment request an Olympus will be asked to provide only B (peer) → C → D part so it would know neither who is a sender nor who is a receiver here.
Stores an encrypted payment channel backup which can be used to reimburse your locked channel balance if you lose an access to your phone. 
Note: saving one backup requires one storage token.
Schedules delayed refunding transactions, which spend funds from a payment channel to your on-chain wallet in a case of a forced channel closing. 
Note: your wallet is capable of spending these transactions all by itself but it’s possible that you lose your phone before a refund time lock is cleared so Olympus acts as a safety belt here. This service also requires one storage token.
Wallet uses these Olympus servers by default:
BTC-1 
BTC-2 
BCA-1 
BCA-2 
It is always possible to opt out of these and use your own. Server sources are available on GitHub.

Here is the network information from ACINQ, the developers of Eclair.
You can see that at the moment for ACINQ: 
- connected channels: 75
- connected nodes: 59
- The Eclair wallets, who have a channel to ACINQ are not in this list. 
You can see it graphical:
In the search box, upper left corner, you can type ACINQ, and than you see the connection to the other nodes, but not to the Eclair wallets.

Every wallet becomes better and better.
The major difference in the wallets is the routing and receiving LN payments.
In my example, you are connected to Bitrefill. For pay your coffee, the route/path, from your phone, via Bitrefill, to the coffee shop, must be discovered.
The Eclair wallet does the routing on the phone, and this makes the first transaction little bit slower. Advantage is, you can use onion routing from your app to the destination. With other words, the transaction is anonymous for the network.
The Lightning wallet outsource the routing to an Olympus server. This server can than very fast do the routing for you. 
But the server know your transactions. It's less anonymous. Some people have no problem with that, other say, can be a little problem.
If the servers are down, the lightning app can work stand alone.
**Receive LN payments**
For receive LN payments, for make it easy, your LN app have to monitor if a person wish to cheat on you. Say, that every day, your app must come short time online for check the status from your channels.
In the future, you will have "watchtowers", or other upgrades,  what will do that for you.
Till now, Eclair plays very safe, and said, we wait longer for integrate the receive LN payments service.
Lightning wallet use the same Olympus servers for regulate receiving from LN.
**my personal opinion:**
Ln is for small recurrent transactions, for pay your coffee, buy a game, refill your phone. And that is where I use LN for.
For receive bitcoins, that is most of the time from an exchange, and it are larger amounts, than I prefer standard bitcoin transactions.
I don't receive small bitcoin transactions.
But that can/will change in the future.
If you don't need LN payments, chose the App where you feel comfortable with. I mean layout, doing a payment, and so on. 
IF you really need now LN payments, than your choice is limited.
In the future more and more LN wallets will become available, with more and more options. 
Difficult to say which one will be the best. 
My advice, wait with put all your coins in 1 wallet. 
Install an wallet what you like, open a channel with very limited funds, and try out. 
If you like it, keep it.

I try to explaine in 2 steps:
**First step**, yes, you can see it like a prepaid Visa card. (I come later back on this, but now see it like a prepaid card)
But you can use the card with every shop/person/entity on the lightning network, not only to the merchant you are connected with! 
Imagine, you are connected to ACINQ.
ACINQ is connected to an other vendor(s),
and the other vendors again to others, and so.
All these connected Merchants/Vendors/Providers create a compleet network.
 You can than send money to everybody who is connected to that network.
This is an overview from the actual LN network:
Or for make it practical, imagine you are connected to Bitrefill, and you decided for fund that channel with 0.010 BTC.
You can now buy your things at bitrefill, using LN.
But later you are at Brisbane airport, and wish to have a coffee. You see a coffee shop and the shop accept LN. You can now use your channel, to bitrefill, for pay your coffee. 
On LN, there will be a path between bitrefill and the coffee shop
**Second step**, it's not really a debit card. 
With a debit card, the bank still control all your spending. If the bank suddenly, accidently or on purpose, put your card as invalid, you can not use your own money.
With a LN wallet, you are in control for all your spendings.
**Little notes:** 
If you chose Eclair wallet, you can not receive LN payments. Sending or receiving standard bitcoin, no problem.
With "Lightning Wallet" or RawTX, you can send and receive LN payments. And of course standard bitcoin send/receive.

It are the number of channels, what can be used for LN routing, not the numbers of users.
Like, all the Eclair channels are not listed. Android Eclair app can send/receive standard bitcoin transaction, but only pay/send using LN.
Because you can not receive LN payments,  you can not use these channels for LN routing, and then they don't need to be known by the network.
Lost 1k of channels means not lost of users. Most of the lost is because of the optimization from channels. Where in the beginning you did have 10 channels from 0.010 BTC, between nodes, you have now 1 channel from 0.1 BTC.
And here and there some nodes go, and other come.
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:58:15
There are several different ideas for work about routing in the future. I will give 2.
The first one is FLARE.
What if you look at LN like a Mobile Ad Hoc Network (MANET)?
- Connections in MANET appear and disappear, same like in LN.
- Nodes in a MANET are not always available, some nodes join, some nodes go offline. Same like the nodes in a decentralized LN Network.
- A MANET is self-configuring, and that will be great for LN.
Major difference between MANET and LN is that LN is source routing, and every extra hop in LN make the path more expensive.
Flare propose than a hybrid Routing Algorithm.
FLARE use the principal that the state of LN can be split in 2 parts:
1) Static information, payment channels between nodes.
2) Dynamic information, status of nodes, distribution of funds in a payment channel, fee for a channel.
Can you pls describe me than why "Flare" don't wil work?
The second  one is outsource the routing to a external server. 
Can you explain me why the system from Olympus server never wil work? Only for the routing, not for anonymity. 
Little remark, you don't need to update all the routing tables balances for every transaction. 
If I use my eclair wallet, and I am connected to ACINQ, this channel don't exist for routing. I can not receive LN on my Eclair wallet, so their is no need for share it to the world. And the transactions what I do, they don't need to be registered in the routing tables. 
Imagine that the local beacons concept, a 3the possible system, will be the base of LN. The sender and receiver only have to compare their beacon list for find a route between them. Only the Beacons need to update "their" connected channels, not the compleet LN network.

When you do a normal bitcoin transfer, think about this chain of events:
Wallet customer - mining - wallet merchant.
*The mining procedure is :*
 
- Checking if the transaction is valid, and if yes,
- write the transaction on the blockchain.
*Back to the coffee:*
We go back to your coffee, but we replace the coffee shop in your town, and you go there 10 days in a row. In total you will order 10 coffees.
**In a standard bitcoin transaction:**
You have 10 days, 10 coffees, than make than 10 times :
Day 1:  wallet customer - mining - wallet merchant. (coffee 1)
Day 2 : wallet customer - mining - wallet merchant. (coffee 2)
Day 3 : wallet customer - mining - wallet merchant. (coffee 3)
and so on till day 10.
That result in:
- 10 times mining activity.
- and 10 entries on the blockchain.
**Lightning network.**
Lightning is designed for small, recurrent transactions.
The basic idea is:
*You can ask the question, must every small transaction, being registered on the blockchain?*
If you answer, no, than you can chose Lightning. 
Practical :
The transaction for a cup of coffee don't have to be registered on the blockchain.
**Lightning Principe**
1) You open a channel with a merchant. (Can be with every body who/what is connected on the lightning network.)
2) That channel must be funded. The value what you decide for the channel, is the Max transaction what you can do with this channel.
Take, you decide for fund the channel with 0.010 Bitcoin.
**The funding can you do in 3 ways:**
A: you fund the channel 100%, the other side 0% . 
That make for you 0.010 Bitcoin, other side 0.000 Bitcoin.
B: the other side, friend or merchant, fund 100 %, you fund 0%.
Other side place 0.010 Bitcoin, you place 0.000 Bitcoin.
C: You split the funding, you do 50$, other side do 50%. Or you can take every split like you wish.
You place 0.005 Bitcoin, other side place 0.005 Bitcoin, in the channel.
*When the channel is funded, the result will be mined and registered on the Blockchain.*
**Paying the coffee shop:**
For explain it easier,
- you have a channel with the coffee shop
- the wallet use the principe that you fund 100%
- and you have a channel from 0.010 Bitcoin.
*The begin status from the channel is:*
0.010 Bitcoin for you,
0.000 Bitcoin for the coffee shop, 
*This status is mined and placed on the blockchain.*
When you pay now for a cup of coffee, take the price is 0.001 Bitcoin for 1 coffee, the wallet makes a bitcoin LN transaction.
This transaction will change the state from the channel to:
0.010 - 0.001 = 0.009 bitcoin for you,
0.000 + 0.001 = 0.001 bitcoin for the coffee shop.
*But this statement is not minded or placed on the blockchain. It stays in the LN network. The transaction is in seconds.*
Now day 2, and you take a second coffee.
The wallets make a new LN statement: 
0.008 Bitcoin for you,
0.002 Bitcoin for the coffee shop.
Again super fast, no mining, and you and the coffee shop can check the latest statement.
Day 3, 3th coffee, new LN statement, 
0.007 Bitcoin for you,
0.003 Bitcoin for the coffee shop. 
Again super fast, and no mining.
*And so on till day 10.* 
On day 10, the wallet makes the last statement,
 0.000 Bitcoin for you, 
0.010 Bitcoin for the coffee shop.
You will leave the town and you and the coffee shop decide for close the channel.
When you close the channel, the last statement,
0.000 for you, 
0.010 for the coffee shop, 
will be mined, and registered on the blockchain.
**Conclusion for  LN :**
You only have to register the opening and closing from the channel on the blockchain. 
Between opening and closing, you can have 10/100/1000/10000/… super fast LN transactions what are not mined/registered on the blockchain.
**Advantage :**
For you, you only have to pay 2 mining fees for 10/100/1000/10000/… transactions.
For the blockchain, you save 10/100/1000/10000 - 2 mining activities.

Take that you have :
- capacity: 0.005 Bitcoin
- can send 0.004 Bitcoin
- can receive 0.001 Bitcoin
Imagine you receive 0.0005 Bitcoin, your channel wil be updated:
- capacity: 0.0050
- can send: 0.0045
- can receive: 0.0005
For the perspective of the merchant; (Imagine, you are the merchant and I am the customer)
You can use 3 systems for fund a channel.
- 1) You fund the channel 100%, the other side nothing
- 2) The other side fund the channel 100%, you fund 0%
- 3) You split the funding, you 50% and the other side 50%, or every split you like.
If you are the merchant, I can open a channel to you, and fund it for 100%. Say I fund the channel with 0.010 Bitcoin and can pay you every time 0.001 Bitcoin.
In this example, the merchant funded nothing, he only receive.

Ideological, it can be a very bad idea.
Financial it can be maybe a good idea. If you see how many people have "their", I know, not your keys, not your money, coins, parked on an exchange. 
Parked on a bank can give than some advantages :
You can have interest, take 1% more than on FIAT. 
Or when you need a loan, personal, or car, or house, and they accept crypto on your account as proof of income.
Or maybe a loan in crypto.
Or they give you free crypto credit/debit card what you can use world wide.

For android you have 2 Lightning wallets.
Eclair and "Lightning wallet". 
Eclair : Your payments are anonymous, the app use tor-routing from app to destination and back. But because the app does the route calculation, first connection can be little bit slower. And you can not accept Lightning payments. You can send and receive normal Bitcoin transactions.
Lightning Wallet: The app outsource the routing to an Olympus server. The Olympus server know al your transactions, and you lose a part from your anonymity. Here you can send, and receive lightning payment, because the server accept them for you. And of course you have standard send/receive bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2018-06-02 05:17:56
But the technical part: For routing, the sending device don't need to know all the channels and routes. You only have to know, how you can reach the destination. And that is a major difference. 
Take for example your PC/Laptop/Phone. They don't have to know all the IP addresses in the world. When you wish to communicate, your TCP/IP checks if the other party is on my own network or on an other network. If on my own network, send the data directly on the network, if on other network, send to my default gateway, the router. The router will take care of it. 
For communicatie with every IP address outside your own network, your TCP/IP on your PC only have to know 1 IP address, your default gateway.
The router will communicate on the internet, what is the best route for reach the destination. 
And for "the best route", you have a lot of interpretations, what is now the best route?
In the first days, routers used RIP, now RIPv2. Here the best route is defined by Hops. If I must find a route from S to D, RIP will check how many routers I have to pass, for go from S to D. Every router is counted as a hop. RIP will chose the route with less hops as the best route.
If route 1 gives S - A - B - C - D, 3 hops between S - D
and route 2 gives  S- X - Y - D, 2 hops between S - D.
Rip will chose Route 2. Problem here, the connection speed/bandwidth between the hops is not used as an argument. (There are other problems, like there is a Max of hops in RIP.)
A Protocol what uses the bandwidth is OSPF. Here the Routers look first to the Bandwidth/speed between the routers and calculate the fastest route.
If route 1 gives S - 10Gbps - A - 10 Gbps B - 10 Gbps C - 10 Gbps - D, 
and route 2 gives  S - 33.6 kbps  - X - 33.6 kbps -  Y - 33.6 kbps - D,
Here OSPF will chose route 1, where RIP use route 2.
Problem with OSPF is that the protocol use a fix number for the bandwidth. Standard OSPF don't use real time measurement from the available bandwidth.
But even when you check the real bandwidth when you calculate the route, you can have the problem from routeswapping. Routeswapping is that, when you have data on the network, the bandwidth change, and that your protocol must adapt every changement. 
Now for Lightning. 
Every protocol what you use, will have pro's an contra's. Same like on the internet. The anti-lightning team will always focus on the contra, and use this like lightning will not work. Like RIP team will say, if you use OSPF, you will have more Hops, and OSPF will never work. Or that OSPF say, you don't use bandwidth, so your RIP will never work. Or protocol X say, but you don't use real time measurement of the bandwidth, so RIP or OSPF will never work. 
In reality, they all work, for a network they are designed for. You can not use RIP on a large Network, RIP haves a Max Hop Limit from 15. The OSPF team will than false argue, RIP never works!But that is only correct for networks with more than 15 Hops.
But OSPF also have its limits. For internet we use than BGP, Border Gateway Protocol.
Even the best route is a false argument. When you send data, the ultimate goal, is that the data, reach the destination. Your ultimate goal is not, always have the best route. The best route is a nice option. And in a dynamical network, your best route can change. But no problem, than I have now the second best route, but my data will reach the destination.
Other wrong example "because all of the route processing and fast Channel opening and closing accounting for all of that needs to occur on the sending device, like a phone".
You can do that on your phone, Eclair wallet does this on android. And till now, it works fine. 
But remember, your end device don't need to know all the routes, only how to reach them.
The  "Bitcoin Lightning Wallet" from Anton kumaigorodski, based on the code from Eclair, does not do this on the phone. 
Bitcoin Lightning Wallet outsource the routing to Olympus servers. (That make it also possible to accept LN payments on your phone.)
Your phone only have to know where the Olympus servers are.

Can I ask, what is your background? 
My speciality is (military) network routing, unicast and multicast.
In my opinion, the title from your article is completely wrong. 
Improvement in the routing protocol will just make Lightning better and better.
Now the LN routing works ok, LN payments do it ok. Always room for improvement.
But the routing protocol must always be adapted to the network. 
When the network will be large and larger, there will be a lot of problems on the road.
For a network designer, there are no problems, only 
interesting situations.

Correct, but in a wallet, you have to spend first.
I use  "Android Lightning wallet" for receive LN Payments.
You open a channel, and fund it with 0.005 Bitcoin.
When this channel opens, you will have a channel update.
- Capacity: 0.005 Bitcoin
- Can send: 0.005 Bitcoin
- Can receive: 0.000 Bitcoin
You first have to spend before you can receive.
If you spend 0.001 Bitcoin, the channel wil update.
- Capacity: 0.005 Bitcoin
- Can send: 0.004 Bitcoin
- Can receive 0.001 Bitcoin
When you open the channel, capacity from the channel is at 100%. You can not accept funds, that place the value from the channel above the maximum capacity.
But this is only for this wallet. At the moment, the Eclair wallet can not receive using LN.
Both wallets of course can send and receive standard bitcoin transactions.

You forget some thing very important:
Before december 2017, there was 1 crypto community what worked together. When a banker came and said, crypto/bitcoin is a bubble, the crypto community stand together and it was very easy for debunk the bankers msg.
After december 2017, only look at btc-sub.
The bankers even don't have to come anymore. Twitter, youtube, reddit, every social media, is full with msg's, Bitcoin is fake, LN never works, investing is BTC is only for compleet stupid people.
And these msg's don't come from bankers, or politicians, or investors. These msg come from inside the community. THe bankers only read and smile. What they tried to do in the last 5 years, the crypto community (BCH) did in the last 6 months, destroy the trust in crypto.
These anti-msg's make people who have money invested in crypto, run away, back to FIAT, and these msg's will never convince a crypto newbie for invest.
Forget the predictions that crypto will rise again. The only way is down, till you have the level where the people, who believe in the technology, will stand. I think some where around 2500/3000 Euro. But some times I think, no, still much to high. We have to go back to few hundred euro per bitcoin.
But we can change it. We can try to give the trust back to the people. But than we have to work together, not spend more energy in destroy the other coin, and the world where we live in.

LN is created for small, recurrent, transactions, what don't need a record on the blockchain. 
Most of the channels created by "normal" users are 0.001 or 0.01 Bitcoin. More than enough for smal recurrent transactions like a cup of coffee of micro transactions.
Of course if you start to use LN for 1-2-3 Bitcoin, you will have problems.  
@_date: 2018-06-21 10:28:26
Yes, correct.
In the network, you only see the channels what can be used for routing.
And for be used as routing, sending and receiving bitcoins is necessary.

For a workable route you have 2 solutions :
1. The app does the route calculation for you. Eclair wallet does that. 
2. The app outsource the route calculation to an server. Lightning wallet App uses Olympus Server for do this.  
But every system have the pro and contra.
Eclair : Your payments are anonymous, the app use tor-routing from app to destination and back. 
Because the app does the route calculation, first connection can be little bit slower. 
And you can not accept Lightning payments. You can send and receive normal Bitcoin transactions.
Lightning Wallet: The Olympus server know al your transactions, and you lose a part from your anonymity. 
Here you can send, and receive lightning payment, because the server accept them for you. 
And of course you have standard send/receive bitcoin transactions.
For IP routing, the first system was static routing. That is/was only possible for a relative small IP network.
When the IP networks became larger and larger, there was dynamic routing. And in dynamic routing, you have than several protocols what do it for you. (RIP - RIPv2 - OSPF - ISIS - BGP - Multicast)
IP routing always adapted to the size from the networks. And for LN, it will be the same. The LN routing protocols always must adapt for new challenges, same like IP.
Where RIPv2 is perfect for small, under 15 Hops networks, you need OSPF for larger networks. Where Multicast was 10 years ago a unicum, in a lot of (military) networks it's now a must have. And for lightning, the routing protocols always have to adapt to the size from the network.
I don't believe that an App on the phone can do the routing if you have millions of users. For now it works fine, but the routing will always be an active line of work.

I think you must look shop by shop.
In my opinion you have 3 combinations from shop and crypto:
-1) When you use Crypto, you have to pay more than with FIAT.
-2) When you use Crypto, you have to pay the same price than FIAT.
-3) When you use Crypto, you have to pay less than with FIAT.
Under 2 and 3 I also place the shops what only accept crypto, and create a unique product, what you almost can not compare with a crypto price.
For combination 1, with crypto you pay more, I follow you. These shops are most of the time created for take profit from a hype. They use some slogans for let people use crypto. 
And there are a lot of people what are eager for pay more, just for can say, I'm proud member from a community. 
I think for combination 2 and 3, we have to support them. When a customer see the profit what he can make, when he use crypto, that will be perfect. The mouth to mouth marketing is the cheapest and strongest marketing what you can have.
It will make people decide for try 1 time crypto, and hopefully they stay than in the crypto world.
Example for me is Joltfun, for steam or origin games. Some steam games are for me till 30% cheaper when I pay with Bitcoin. And than I will be eager for promote them.

People who believe in the technology of Bitcoin, for them, Bitcoin stays the best, and these will stay with Bitcoin.
New people in the crypto community, who search for a global/cash payment coin, will "maybe" prefer Globalcoin, because they already have Facebook, and don't forget, Globalcoin is a stable coin.
Look at the altcoins, the same people also believe in some altcoins what are clearly a scam.
I think, when they invest in Globalcoin, and after some time, there are technical or financial problems with the coin, they can, or will, reflect this on the crypto community. Thinking, Globalcoin is a scam, so every coin is a scam.
Look at the BCH community. Most of them think, when we destroy the reputation of BTC, or the technology behind the coins, people will come to BCH.
In reality, people don't go to BCH, they leave the crypto community, or they never will start with crypto coins.
The same can/will happen to Globalcoin. Or the coin is a success, and people start, or move from BTC/BCH/ETH, to Globalcoin. Or the coin is a disaster, and the people move away from crypto, not change coin.
On the other hand, maybe new people, who like the technology/protocol behind Bitcoin, will see the beauty in the technology and will fall in love for Bitcoin.

I am just tired for read again, every day, the same copy and paste, change a few words, "new" reason why routing not works.
You have the point what every body makes and you are correct. And I don't fight that argument.
The LN routing is now ok, because the "routing" now works fine.
Why it works fine, because the numbers of nodes is tiny.
But the routing protocol is a always under construction, the protocol must be adapted to the network. 
You already have now 2 basic systems:
Your phone does the routing. (Eclair)
The app outsource the routing to an external server, but also can work on the phone. (Lightning wallet) 
If you compare with unicast routing:
Like on the internet, dynamic routing protocols are created in function from the network.
One of the first protocols was RIP. At the moment from implementation, RIP (Classful) was good, not perfect. And when the networks become larger and larger, RIP was adapted to RIPv2 (Classless).
But RIP v1&amp;v2 have problems in the design. In specific situations it gave major problems. 1 Of the solutions is that RIP can not be used on a network with paths more than 15 Hops. 
Solution for larger networks, OSPF or IS-IS, …
But these protocols also have problems with very large networks, level internet. But than you have BGP.
And so on.
What I read about "LN routing wil never work", is that "people" will use the problems from RIPv1, and use that for explain that the internet never will work.
Sometimes you even have to change the basic thinking for routing, you have to go away from unicast to multicast.
And the first multicast communication on a network with hubs, made your network completely crash. Some people also predicted, multicast will never be used on a large scale. What where they wrong.
Hubs are now switches, some switches are specific designed for multicast, and you have several multicast routing protocols.
Even IPv4 changed to IPv6.
When I look in real life networks, designers still use IPv4, and sometimes for small networks, they still use RIPv2.
My point is, if the routing protocol is not under construction, yeah, it can give a problem when you have millions of nodes.
But before the routing comes in problems, the protocol will be adapted. 
It's good that technical people point to a problem, what maybe can occur. The biggest problem will be if designers not think for solutions. And trust me, there are a lot of people who work every day about routing. Sometimes with solutions who nobody else taught about.

I always see the use of lightning in combination with standard bitcoin transactions. 
And to be correct, I also see the use of LN/Bitcoin in combination with other crypto coins. Every coin has his pro and contra, and I select the coin with the best pro.
Lightning was created for small recurrent transactions. Like your daily cup of coffee or newspaper. Fast payments and registration on the blockchain is not needed.
And then you have standard bitcoin transactions, where you prefer registration on the blockchain or more value transactions.
And I have seen LN change. 
- only send small amounts
- send larger amounts
- much better routing
- receive small amounts
- receive larger amounts
And I also think that only LN for a gambling site is not a perfect combination.
It's crazy that every person has to open a channel with the idea,  I will win the jackpot and the funding of the channel has to be the jackpot.
You can use LN for relatively small payments, and if a person wins the jackpot, a standard bitcoin transaction. Or a more privacy coin like Monero.
When it was my casino, and a person wins a large amount, I will use standard bitcoin transaction, especially for the registration on the blockchain. The gambling site always has a prove the payment is done. Before payment, ask bitcoin address of the winner, and transfer to this address, and keep the communication.

My point is: using payment channels is not always the best solution for every transaction.
Payment channels are perfect for what they are created for, recurrent transactions. And how smaller the transactions, how better. 
But small is relative. For example, I use LN to buy games (joltfun), my VPN and proxy (Torguard) and my monthly phone bill(s) (Bitrefill).
All with 1 channel to ACINQ.
Everybody hopes that winning the jackpot on your website will be recurrent, but in reality, it will be not. Opening a channel to prepare yourself to receive the jackpot is overkill. (I assume that your jackpot will be more than a few bitcoins)
You can do it, but why? 
There are much better alternatives to pay out if a person wins the jackpot.
Much better you can define with: 
- I need record on the blockchain to have proof that I have paid out and I use bitcoin.
- Or the opposite, I use Monero to give the winner anonymity
- Or because of the fluctuation in the fiat price, I use a stable coin like Tether.
And so can everybody fill in what is the best coin to pay out the jackpot.

I asked myself, will I use the Arf wallet?
Possible yes, if the wallet is in combination with LN.
My first priority is LN, with routing. Reason speed and anonymity.
And all my LN wallets have a standard bitcoin wallet.
Installing a new wallet, transfer coins to the wallet, without LN implementation, I don't know.
@_date: 2019-06-12 15:01:43
Before I use LN, can live with it.
When I work with trusted partners, I assume if the wallet says incoming transaction, or after 1 a 2 confirmations, all is fine.
After some LN payments, and back to a Bitcoin transaction, no instant confirmation, why does it takes so long?
Oh yeah, we are back to Bitcoin.

To surf the internet, you don't need to learn HTML, you only need a user-friendly web browser.
The same for lightning, you only need a user-friendly Lightning wallet, you don't need to learn the Lightning protocol.

I don't use my own LN &amp; BTC node.
BLW, Eclair, BLue Wallet on my android phone. 
For BLW and Eclair, 1 channel to ACINQ, that is al.
Blue Wallet, they take care of the "channels".


And this a recurrent argument what I can not understand.
12 Year old kids in Europe and Asia learn basic algebra like: (a+b)2 = a2 + 2ab + b2
And this is an easy basic algebra example.
But suddenly the use of LN channel is to difficult for them? 
When you choose to fund your channel with 0.100 Bitcoin, you only can spend 0.100 Bitcoin. 
If you have spend 0.030 BTC, you still can use  0.100 - 0.030 = 0.070 BTC.
If you spend again 0.010 BTC, you still can use 0.070 - 0.010 = 0.060 BTC
If you have 0.060 BTC, you can receive 0.100 - 0.060 = 0.040 BTC.
And you don't have to do the math, the wallet tells it to you.
Does the bitcoin in the wallet reach zero, you can refill till a Max of 0.100 Bitcoin.
Are people outside Europe or Asia really so un-educated that basic math, sum and subtract, is to difficult?

I think you are mixing 2 work principles in Lightning.
- A channel only between 2 persons
- Your channel connected to a node
**Theoretical, a channel between 2 persons, and no other connections.**
Then you are correct. The committed funds are only between these 2 persons. You have no connections to the outside world. But practical, this is un-useful. You need a channel with every person who you wish to pay, or from who you wish to receive.
**In real life, connected to a node.**
In real life, your wallet is connected to a node. And this node is again connected to several other nodes. And these nodes again to other nodes, and so on.
Your wallet connected to a node -- the node connected to the LN network makes that you can connect to everybody on the network.
Your node will forward your transaction to the destination. Same principle as the internet.
The committed coins are between you and the node but, using the node, you can send, or receive, on the complete LN network.
And extra fun is, if you send to my LN wallet, for the outside world, you send to your node. Nobody, outside you and me, know you send to me.
- Imagine, you have an android phone, and you use Bitcoin Lightning Wallet (BLW).
- When you installed the BLW, the wallet needs a connection to an LN Node. Or you use the standard node ACINQ, or you selected your preferred node. The wallet does all for you.
- You fund the channel with 0.010 Bitcoin.
If you wish now to send 0.004 Bitcoin to me, no problem. The node will find me on the LN network, and will send the coins to me.
5 Mins later you wish to top-up your phone, using Bitrefill, for 0.002 BTC. Your node take care that your coins go to Bitrefill
And vice versa, I wish to send 0.003 BTC to you, my node will send the coins to you.
You wish to buy a steam game on joltfun, using LN. So long your channel has enough "balance", your node will do again al the work.
The node(s) don't care to who or when you send your coins. So long you have enough coins to send or room to receive.

I did not have found the option to refill my BLW channel, using directly the standard, build in, bitcoin wallet.


I like BLW, was my second LN wallet, but the first what can receive on the channel. BLW have learned me a lot about LN.
My first wallet was Eclair for Android. But with eclair, you can not receive on the LN channel. (Will change)
No technical reason for keeping BLW and BlueWallet.
For BLW, I like that you see the channel details, it reminds me more how LN works. And you have more control about your channel. I like the LN routing, and I always will make sure that my channel is not directly connected to the merchant. (If I know the node from the merchant)
BlueWallet is more a black box, you don't really know what happens. Very easy for people who wish to use LN, and don't care about some details about your channel.
With BLW you control your channel, open, close, and connected to which node. BlueWallet does that for you. BleuWallet, for close a channel, you have to go via ZigZAg.

Why not use milli, micro (µ), nano like in metric prefix?
**Most of the world already works with metric, and knows milli, micro and nano.**
If you have a basic knowledge from electricity, I think most of the high school students worlwide will have, than you know the values already from Capacitors or coils.
- 0,xxx Bitcoin = milli
- 0,000 xxx Bitcoin  = µ or micro
- 0,000 000 xxx Bitcoin = Nano
Some examples:
150 milli bitcoin = 0.150 Bitcoin
256 micro = 0.000256 Bitcoin
750 Nano = 0.000 000 75 Bitcoin
1 Sat = 10 Nano
To make it easier, we can make 1 sat = 1 nano, but not really needed.
And if the Bitcoin value goes to the moon, you can easily stay in the metric system.
After nanno, you can go to pico, and after pico, femto, and so on.
0.000 000 000 XXX Bitcoin = pico
0.000 000 000 000 XXX Bitcoin = femto

No, that means, that if you explain why crypto is needed, you need to adapt, your story to your public.
And what maybe is common use for you, can be something exceptional for the other person.
Take internet connection, when I go outside, and walk 500 meter to the right, there is no internet, or mobile, connection.
But when I go to a major city in Asia, there you will find almost 4G in every dark corner from the city.
But imagine this:
If I go to the local market, and pay the merchant in cash, in seconds, the merchant can use that cash, go to another merchant an buy a beer. The transaction is in seconds, and the merchant can spend directly.
How you do a crypto transaction?
- fiat on bankaccount
- transfer to exchange, maybe pay a fee
- exchange to crypto, pay a fee
- send the crypto to your wallet, pay a fee
- send to the wallet from a merchant, pay a fee
- merchant send to his exchange, pay a fee
- exchange to fiat, pay a fee
- transfer to bank account, maybe pay a fee
- go to ATM and take the fiat, maybe pay a fee.
- go to other merchant and pay for a beer.

Most of the bills, electricity, phone, internet, tv are paid, in a suppermarket, at the cashier, with cash.

The AFM conducts its supervision by means of inspections, enforcement and transfer of standards, and in so doing expressly monitors signals originating from the market and findings from its own control organisation. If the AFM identifies any breaches, it can impose sanctions. It may issue instructions or public warnings, place institutions under undisclosed custody, withdraw licences, cancel or refuse registrations or file reports with the Public Prosecution Service. The AFM is also authorised to impose fines and orders for periodic penalty payments.

DNB Supervision
They monitor financial institutions' compliance with rules and regulations. They pay particular attention to the financial structure of an institution, and the expertise and integrity of its directors. Sound supervision reduces the risk of your bank, pension fund or insurance company getting into difficulties. Although this supervision cannot guarantee that a financial institution will never fail, it does reduce this risk.

Not really devil's advocate, but it's a statement I often hear, in the line of, I have nothing to hide, so everybody can see what I do.
And next step is then, if you wish that nobody see/know what you do, then you have something to hide.
And a lot of people from the smartphone/Google/Apple generation, they are already used that everything that they do, especially online, is registered by these companies. 
They also have membership cards from major stores, and they don't care that these stores know what, and when, they buy.
If you look than for Bitcoin wallets, you have fancy wallets, like Jaxx or exodus. Or you have major propaganda teams like for Bitpay. I give Jaxx and Exodus as an example, because I also have installed and used them. You have to start somewhere, and on the internet, I find good reviews, why not try them.
Till now my favorite Bitcoin wallet is Samourai.
Bitpay wallet I installed for use if the merchant has Bitpay Payment Provider.
I think I understand what Wasabi do, for privacy, but still, my first thinking was, why change again from wallet? 
What makes Wasabi different that I will install and use the wallet?
And then I was thinking, when I speak with friends, or crypto newbies, how can I motivate them for use Wasabi. And that was the reason for my question.
My opinion, the UX is for me the same than every other basic Bitcoin wallet. 
Password, write down the words (Screenshot), and create/load the wallet.
Generate receive address, and the buttons send/receive, not really rocket science.
Coinjoin, that's of course new.
When I tell a newbie, don't use Jaxx or ,,,,, It is terrifying how deep the "npm dependency hell" is, they have no idea what I am talking about. 
For be honest, I also needed google.

I and my friends explain this system to everybody who wishes to listen. But it's easier to use when you are European. SEPA is for free, in 1 day, when your bank support it, the same day, and you can easily open an account on a Thai exchange.
For the USA, I have this from a US resident, almost impossible to open an account on a Thai Exchange. Reason, more control about KYC.
We try to promote Crypto in Thailand, but very difficult. For the Non-Thai, with an income from outside Europe, is easier.
If you have no work permit, it's also very time consuming and expensive to do an International transfer from Thai Baht to Euro. Last time ripple was than a very good choice. Ripple on BX, to Bitstamp in Europe, and exchange to Euro. 
The most used exchange in Thailand is Bx.in.Th. Very good exchange, professional, and a good support team.
There is also TDAX, now Satang.pro. No complaints about, used them too, but I prefer Bx. I like more the layout form BX.
But always good to check the difference in rate between them. But is minimal.

**Internet - gain a lot, for a little risk**
When you started to use the internet, you gained a lot, for a little bit of risk. It was possible to surf on the internet, free xxx, chat, download your hidden fantasies on the use-net, a major improvement for your computer life. 
And almost every person can find something positive on the internet, for a small risk.
The small riks, you can have a computer virus, or see some information what you really not wish to see. But no prob, we take that riks, with pleasure.
**Bitcoin, gain a little bit for a high risk**
With Bitcoin, it's vice versa. Most of the people really don't need bitcoin, they have cash or other forms of fiat.
And believe it or not, most of the people trust banks. Especially the older generations. Why do they have to change to Bitcoin? 
And the risk of using Bitcoin is enormous, if you compare it with what you gain. 
You can lose your money, for? Faster transaction than cash? Better anonymity than cash? 
And with all the fake ICO and Coins, there are more common people who lost a lot of money in the crypto world, than there are people who have made a profit.
**What Bitcoin can do to have a boom**
For me there is only 1 rule, believe that most of the people like cash, and they love to use it. 
Why, because paying with cash, or fiat, is easy, safe and anonymous.
- The first step what crypto has to do is build up trust. That the common people wish to try Bitcoin or another coin.
And building up the trust will only can become realtity, if different coins work together. 
And not that every coin tries to destroy the other coin, hoping the users come to my coin.
The only thing what the users will do, is going away from crypto and not change from a coin. If Bitcoin is a hoax, or if Lightning never will work, why coin X will be no hoax?
And sometimes that also means that you have to fight in your own community. 
If person X writes the biggest BS about another coin, correct him. Now most of the time, look at some other subs, the person who writes negatively about the other coin is a hero, right or not, we don't care.
- If you have the trust, make the coin more user-friendly, or give better options, than cash or fiat.
A merchant can give a discount when you pay with bitcoin.
Make lightning fast transactions possible, for small amounts.
Create a better form of anonymity.
Make that the bitcoin owner decide, who, where, when and for what that he can use his coins. 
And in my opinion, Lightning has all of that.
You have payments in seconds, anonymity when you use LN Routing, and ease of use. 
If other coins wish to be successful, they have to copy somehow the basic principles from lightning.
Take 0-confirmation, transaction finished in seconds, and ease of use. 
Maybe when a coin is the Payment Service Provider, and wallet, they can do a "database operation". You also have payments in seconds, but is it still crypto?
Is there then only place for 1 coin?
No, some coins can be specialized in some aspects of the transaction.
- More anonymity
- Slower but Higher volume
- ...

Maybe a stupid question, but how do you know, that the designers from the wallet, don't know the seed?
That there is no little backdoor what create a msg to the designers?

Or do you have people who test every code for check if there are no hidden functions?

Netherlands, yes, it has a lot do with it.
It defines how you look at a financial transaction.
For people in Europe, cash is more and more replaced by bank activities.
And your income, must be paid on a bank account or with a check. With some exceptions on the rule.
For you it is then easy to buy BTC, you do a SEPA transfer and there you go. Europeans play with bank accounts, SEPA transfers, or International Transfers, Paypal, credit cards, debit cards, stock exchange, and so on.
Where I live, Thailand,
most of the people don't have a bank-account. A wallet on a phone is then something very strange.
And that makes the change from cash to crypto much more difficult.

The problem is communication, and at the same time, non-personal-communication never can be the solution to the problem.
The best way to prove what Lightning can do, is a real-life experience. Show people how LN works with doing a real-life transaction.  Not on youtube, not on other social media, but in real life. 
And no staged transaction!
You have the very small risk that maybe something goes wrong, but hey, that is real life. Much better than a staged transaction.
Social media can be an extra tool, but cannot be your major tool to show what LN can do.
If you learn about communication, you always will have a subject, how to destroy the communication.
For example, if LN makes a statement: LN is created to pay, small, recurrent, amounts. Imagine, your every day cup of coffee.
If you wish to destroy that communication, you only have to look at the most important parts of the msg, and use the opposite.
The most important parts are:
- To pay
- Small amounts
- Recurrent
For destroy the msg, you only have to use:
LN never will work because:
- To Pay, the opposite is receive: Oh my goth, you can not receive money? This I can not believe. And then you can create an example: I won 0.001 BTC with LN gambling, how can I receive my profit? 
- small amounts, the opposite is large amounts: You can only pay very small amounts, shocked. Who gonna use that? Your created example for high amounts: How will I pay my workers, they earn much more than the price of a coffee.
And so on for recurrent, routing, pay for open a channel, ...
When you use social media to bring your communication, the counterpart have all the time what they need, to study your msg, and destroy your msg. You always will be too late to debug the counter msg.

Can you explain, why a new (non-technical) Bitcoin user, who like to use Bitcoins to order a Pizza, have to use Wasabi?
When these users start with Bitcoins, they can select several Windows Botcoin wallets. I think than about Jaxx, Exodus, Bitpay, ....
And after a wallet is chosen, Bitcoins are bought on well know exchanges like Coinbase.
Most of the transactions from these people will be, home delivery food, charge phone, book hotel, ... All actions where there is a direct link between the wallet and who you are, and where you live.
And when the words "privacy wallets" fall, they will directly think, only for people who do illegal things on the internet, not for me.
What will be your arguments for lett them decide to try the Wasabi wallet?
And imagine, these people know what bitcoins are, know how they can do a transaction, and know what bitcoin addresses are. But there it stops. They know basic Bitcoin transactions, using a mobile wallet.
But they have no idea what  BIPXXX are, and no idea what Coin-Join is.
If the argument will be, because Wasabi uses Coin-join, they will answer, Coin Whatte? How will you convince them they need to use Coin-join or other systems?
How you can motivate them for use Wasabi?
Or Wasabi is not for this public and these people better use Jaxx, Exodus, Bitpay, ...?
@_date: 2019-01-09 05:18:56

Question Nr 1: My first idea is that this is already possible. I think already on Android Wallet level.
Imagine, you have 0 standard Bitcoin (BTC), and say, the kid needs a name, 0 Lightning Bitcoins (LN BTC).
(I know, there is not something as LN Bitcoin, but I use it to explain my idea)
You can use Bitcoin Lightning Wallet (BLW) and I use Thor, to open,  via Bitrefill, a channel to you. Take the channel has a value of 0.100 BTC.
You can send and receive on this channel.
You still have 0 BTC, and 0 LN BTC.
But now you can receive 0.100 LN BTC on your channel.
And for some reason, I send you 0.100 LN BTC.
And you have now 0 BTC, but 0.100 LN BTC.
So long you use LN, you can spend, and receive on your channel. If you always will use LN BTC, you never will touch the blockchain.
And not forget, with receive, you can refill every time your channel till Max Capacity of 0.100 BTC.
For example:
you spend 0.025 LN BTC.
- Capacity of the channel: 0.100 BTC
- Can send: 0.075 BTC
- Can receive: 0.025 BTC
And now you receive: 0.010 BTC
- Capacity of the channel: 0.100 BTC
- Can send: 0.085 BTC
- Can receive: 0.15 BTC
And so long you spend/receive is in balance, your channel can stay open till eternity.
And if you use a real LN wallet, al your transactions are to, and from, 1 node. The node where you are connected to. And you have a high level of anonymity.

- Top up my BLW channel, LN transfer from BlueWallet to my LN channel from BLW
And then, standard bitcoin transaction from my exchange to my Android wallet. 
After few seconds, why does it take so long. Oh yes, confirmations, but first idea was, why so long, is something wrong?

You are right.
But the game changer for me is that, when a merchant accepts Lightning, I think I really will use it. Even when I have cash in my pocket, I think, or I'm almost sure, that I will select LN.
Black Canyon or Amazon coffee, Lightning or Cash, my feelings tell me, I go for LN and keep the cash for later.
If a merchant accepts Bitcoin or BCH or another coin, then maybe I will use it.
The main difference is, with LN I know in seconds the transaction is done, and I have anonymity. A standard bitcoin transaction, I feel comfortable after 1 confirmation, knowing I have paid the merchant. Till the first confirmation, I hope nothing went wrong.  And with a standard blockchain transaction, it's on the blockchain, forever. Sometimes anonymity can be useful.
Online payments, bitrefill, Torguard VPN, Joltfun steam games, I have noticed, when possible, I always chose LN. And I love the way how it works.
Of course, a lot is based on personal feelings. And who am I. But if more people think like me, than LN can be a success.

Wait, most of the people in the crypto coins community say, go away from banks, never use them. They are thiefs, abuse you, ...
The local people believe that, and refuse to go to banks, or bank app on a phone, or bank building. They only trust cash. Especially the anonymity from cash transactions. You don't have to pay tax if the government doesn't know the transactions.
Now the government will try to force them for go to banks.
And when they are a bank member, they don't need crypto. All that you can do with crypto, you can do faster with bank applications.
Than the crypto community will tell them, because you are now member of a bank, we will teach for leave the bank and only use crypto?

Update: ABN Amro onderzoekt of klanten behoefte hebben aan een veilige opslagmogelijkheid voor cryptomunten, en komt daarom met de 'Wallie’. Vooralsnog gaat het alleen om een onderzoek onder klanten, zegt ABN Amro. **Toezichthouders AFM en DNB lieten afgelopen week juist weten dit soort initiatieven af te keuren.**
De toezichthouders lieten vrijdag nog weten niets te zien in crypto-activiteiten van Nederlandse banken. Volgens AFM-fintechspecialist Lars van de Ven **geeft dat crypto's ten onrechte een betrouwbaar karakter.**
In een vrijdag uitgebracht rapport omschreven AFM en DNB het als volgt: ‘Specifiek blijven we alert op gereguleerde aanbieders van financiële producten en financiële diensten gebaseerd op crypto’s zolang de risico’s op het gebied van consumentenbescherming en financieel-economische criminaliteit significant zijn. We blijven bijvoorbeeld kritisch richting activiteiten van gereguleerde instellingen die cryptowallets (willen) aanbieden of de verhandeling van niet gereguleerde crypto’s zoals Bitcoin mogelijk (willen) maken.’

That is true.
If the supervisors give a go, or the bank takes the risk for the do it without the go, it's huge.
I was surprised about the positive response from the test group, and the attention given by other customers who are eager to have the wallet.

Not to fast.
Officially it's only a test if ABN AMRO users are interested in a Bitcoin Wallet. 500 ABN AMRO customers created the test group.
The idea is that people are interested in Bitcoin, but are scared of using them, because of all the negative news about hacking and lost of coins. 
The bank will take care of your Bitcoins, and you will be insured, when the bank is hacked and lost your coins, for a loss up to 6 000 Euro. 
You control your wallet, but the bank controls your coins.
The biggest problem is that the Dutch Supervisors on bank activity, AFM and DNB, already came with negative advice.
The statement from AFM is that regular banks never can work together with crypto. If they do it, then they will give the impression that you can trust crypto.
For the official bank supervisors, crypto is closer to a scam than to a trustful currency.
**Off the record:**
ABN AMRO believes in Bitcoin and their customers are really eager to adopt them. The Bitcoin Wallet test is a huge success, and other customers contact the helpdeks, hoping that they can have soon the wallet.
Only problem is the negative vision from AFM and DNB.
But representatives of the bank, are in negotiation with the supervisors, to change that negative vision.
Yes, if AFM and DNB give positive advice.

Welcome in the world from crypto.
And for me, has nothing to do with being an ass hole or not.
Why you have to pay for using your own coins?
If I pay you in cash, the transaction cost is 0. 
Then you can ask the question, when I pay in crypto, why do I have to pay a transaction cost or other costs?
And here it's personal, if you accept the cost for the extra service, that the coins gives you, or not. And that declares directly the reason why you have several types/models of crypto coins.
For me, I like the BLW wallet, and the few sats what I have to pay, no problem. The extra service is great.
The same for using LN. The speed and anonymity when you use LN routing, and that for a few sats, no prob.
But I don't like for example Bitpay in combination with BCH/BTC.
You can not make a transaction to Bitpay, from your preferred wallet, you first have to select a wallet approved by Bitpay.
And then, Bitpay can ask a fee for that.
No, not my idea from cryptocurrency. But some merchants prefer Bitpay in combination with BCH. And that's why I have Bitpay.

I speak about the daily use of coins. 
When you have a bank account, here in Thailand:
- A bank transaction between accounts from the same bank, in seconds, for free
- A bank transaction, to accounts from another bank, in seconds, little fee or free
- Bank App on your phone, you can do transfers, charge phone, pay bills (read Bar- or QR code), pay in seconds. And the same for online banking.
- With the app, you give a nickname for your friend(s), and can pay bank account to bank account in seconds, for free. For free or very small amount if other bank.
- Or you have private app's like Line Pay, or for Lazada, or ...

My personal definition of Stable:
When I use Bitcoin to exchange my Euro to Thai Baht, that will take some time. Exchange on Pro-Coinbase or Bitstamp, transfers to BX, exchange to Thai Baht.
You can calculate 1 Hr transfer time.
And then take 1 Hr from BX to my Thai Bank account.
In total 2 Hr's.
Stable for me is, that in 1 Hr, there is no major change in the price from Bitcoin. Up is no problem, down is more a problem.
practical: 
when I buy for  4 000 euro Bitcoin, and I transfer them to BX, that in the transfer time, the price from the Bitcoin, don't drop, more than I gain with international bank transfer or TransferWise or ...
My minimum gain when I use coins, BTC or ETH or LTC or BCH is 3%
That makes, that in the time, buy on Pro-Coinbase, transfer to BX, and sell on BX, bitcoin can not drop more than 3%.
And here the difference between BTC and BCH can be very important.
For BTC, BX needs 3 confirmations (take 30 mins)
For BCH, BX needs 15 confirmations (take 150 mins)
When I decide for use BCH, there is a major increase in the transfer time. And that makes the risk a little bit higher.

When you have a direct channel to the node from a merchant, the fee for LN transactions is/can/will/be 0.
You only have to pay a LN transaction fee, when you u use LN routing. And here is the answer also yes, so long you have nodes what offer these low fees. 
If there is now a node, what will ask extreme higher fees, no path , with always the exception on the rule, will use,  this node, and that will make the node unusable.

I think the theory is not valid, for Europe/USA, because the young generation have a good banking system.
 But it can be valid for Asia or Africa.
In my opinion, bitcoin was a perfect idea, before the Euro.
Before the Euro:
Every European country did have his own currency, and when you lived in a small country, often you did have 2, 3 currencies in your wallet. At that time, bitcoin would be perfect for have 1 currency in Europe. But now we have the Euro. 1 Currency for most of the European countries.
In the same period, national bank transfer was a waiting game. Standard it was 3 a 4 days waiting before a transaction was confirmed. European transaction, only for businesses know how to do it. But now, some banks do already real time national transaction and for Europe you have SEPA. Again, Bitcoin came to late.
For Asia, maybe the young people can give here the adaption from crypto a boost. They can try to make crypto the currency for ASEAN.

Because you are located in Indonesia, I maybe can give you a tip. I am European living in Thailand. And I always need to shop online for shoes, reason, size 46 almost impossible to find in a Thai brick and mortel shop. And I am not alone, all the "big foot" have to shop online.

But here in Thailand, 99.99 % Local merchants country side only accept cash. In tourist locations, like large shopping complex or international merchants, you can use creditcard. But crypto, almost nothing.
And than I have to exchange my crypto to Thai Baht for pay bills or go to the market. But i have better exchange rate than international bank transfer. Crypto make my life than better.

**For a newbie:**
- For buy bitcoin, you need an exchange between Euro and Bitcoin. For a newbie in Europe, Coinbase is very good.
- You create a account on Coinbase.
- You link a European bank account to your Coinbase account
- You use SEPA, free European bank transfer,  for transfer 1.000 Euro, from your "normal" bankaccount to your Coinbase euro account.
- On Coinbase, you buy for 1.000 Euro Bitcoin.
- Your bitcoins are stored on a Coinbase Bitcoin address.
- Now you wait 18 months.
- You sell your Bitcoins on Coinbase
- You will receive 2.000 Euro on your Coinbase Euro account.
- You do again a SEPA banktransfer, now from your Coinbase Euro account to your "normal" bankaccount.
And finish, you gained 1.000 Euro minus some fee.
**If you have more experience:**
- Coinbase is very easy to use, but the fees are high.
Cheaper, but more dangerous, is to buy the bitcoins on GDAX/Pro Coinbase or other exchange.
- After you have to Bitcoins, sometimes it's better to remove the bitcoins from the exchange to a wallet. 
Here you can chose what for wallet you like.
**Edit: added personal opinion:**
- Be careful, after 18 months, the 1.000 euro can also be 100 or 10 Euro.
- Pay first some learning money. I mean, use first a much lower amount of money, take 50 or 25 or 10 Euro. Buy bitcoins, transfer to the wallet(s) from what you wish to try, and buy something with bitcoins. And if you believe you understand the basics, than go for the 1.000 Euro.

I will try to explain what Schnorr wil improve.
- when yo do a bitcoin transaction, you sign the transaction.
- this signature use some room in the block on the blockchain
**Multiple addresses:**
- You can create a transaction, from multiple sources/addresses to 1 receiving address.
- Every source address need than a signature
- If you have 10 source addresses, you will need than 10 signatures.
- These 10 signatures, increase the transaction size, what gives more transaction fee, and they use more space/room in the block.
**Schnorr Signature**
If 1 person, use multiple source addresses in a transaction, in place of sign for every source, he can use 1 Schnorr signature.
**Advantage from Schnorr:**
Reduce used room and fees
**Practical example:**
If you open this block, and scroll down, you will find 16 transactions with a crazy number of source addresses. (For some people it are spam transactions) All these source addresses/signatures use transaction space, and increase the blocksize.

Their safety model is good. Your money is "safe".
You don't have the keys.
High fees, but when you have more experience, you can move to GDAX/Pro-Coinbase

Financial, logical, mathematical, all was proven before 2002, that Europe was not ready for the Euro. But in 2002 there was the Euro. 
From 2002 till now, I lost the count how many times the Euro was almost dead. But the same powers used billions of tax-money, and we still have the Euro.
When there is 1 positive news about crypto, the financial specialist stand in line for say, Bitcoin/Crypto is a hoax. 
Belgian friends told me, a gasstation install a Bitcoin ATM. Comes in the local news. But directly, you have on the national news, a "trusted financial expert", Paul D'Hoore, who say it's crazy to use Bitcoins. It's a hoax, completely fake. 
The link is in Dutch, but this was the local news.
If you live in Europe and have a income:
Your have a loan for your house, a loan for your car, a loan for your creditcards, and a loan for maybe your apple phone or tv. And all in Euro. All your life you have to pay in Euro. 
**Of course always the exceptions on the rule.**

They are payed in Euro, and the transaction must be on a bankaccount. You have some exceptions for cash payment, but your salary must normally be transferred to a bankaccount.

Almost every shop in Benelux accept bankcontact.
for Horeca, bankcontact of creditcard
Do you like to pay your friends, the app on your phone. In seconds.

It's a very long time ago, that I used this initialism, but here it comes,  **RTFM**

I use Eclair and Lightning wallet on Android.
For Eclair, for opening from my channel, I paid 0.00000541 BTC (April 2018)
For LN wallet, for opening from my channel, I paid 0.0001 BTC (June 2018)
I never have paid around $20 for opening a channel.
For Eclair wallet, They use union routing for the complete path. In principe, ACINQ have no idea what you do with your money. Of course, they can break their promises, and collect your data. But if this come public, will destroy their company.
For LN wallet, the Olympus Servers can keep information about you. But for most of the people, Ln Wallet is a "between" solution for test LN receiving, and when Eclair is full operational, they will switch to Eclair. Or if you look more for functionality than anonymity, you stay with LN wallet.
But if you worry about privacy, you also don't know what Android, or Apple, or Microsoft do with the data from your App. 
I think you used the store from Google for have the App's? How are you sure that you have the original version from the Binaries? How are you sure that Google, Apple, windows, don't have give you an adapted version with a backdoor?
The best security solution will be a full node. But you don't need a laptop for that. You can build/buy a hardware device, specific for you node. 
And you connect to your node, using your phone/Laptop, and secured tunnel. 
Problem here, can you trust the hardware components? Is there no build-in backdoor in the specific hardware?
For practical use, I see Bitcoin and LN with 3 options:
option 1: standard bitcoin transaction
option 2 : LN transaction, with direct channel
option 3 : LN transaction with LN routing
And I always will switch between these 3 options, depending on what for payment I am doing now. It's not, because I have LN, that I forget standard bitcoin transactions.
If I need a record on the block chain, I will do standard transaction.
And for security, people who don't care about their "Internet Search History", or "Location", or that their credit card company, or bankcard company, know what they do with money or life, will worry if the Olympus server from LN wallet knows they bought a coffee at Brisbane airport, using LN.
@_date: 2018-07-19 03:32:46
I think you make a mix from what LN can do, and the implementation in a LN wallet. 
The wallets don't implement all the options from the LN network.
**LN funding from a channel:**
A channel in LN can be funded in 3 ways:
- You fund the channel 100%
- The other side fund the channel 100%
- You split the funding, take you 50% and other side 50%. Or every split what you like.
**Basic options from a LN wallet:**
- You always have a standard Bitcoin address for send and receive standard bitcoins transactions.
- And you have a LN channel/wallet.
- The Max capacity from the LN channel is now 0.166 Bitcoin.
**Payments with LN wallet: you have 3 options**
- option 1: You can do standard bitcoin transactions
- option 2: You have a channel directly to your friend
- option 3: Your channel is connected to a node, and you do LN routing
Now every wallet can decide what for options they build in. I only will use the most used Android wallets, Eclair and LN wallet.
- you can send and receive standard bitcoin transactions.
- you only can send LN transactions.
**LN Wallet:**
- You can send and receive standard bitcoin transactions.
- You can send and receive LN transactions
- You can not accept incoming Channel openings, you have to open the channel. 
- This makes that you have to fund the channel for 100%
When a channel is open, you have 3 important parameters:
- Channel Capacity: The funding (x)
- Can send: Max bitcoin what you can send (y)
- Can receive: Max bitcoin what you can receive (z)
The principle is now: The channel can not have a value, higher than the chosen capacity: x Max = y + z
That give that you first have to spend, before you can receive. 
**Imagine, you funded the channel with a capacity from 0.100 Bitcoin. (I don't use the fees, I wish to explaine the principles)** 
The first channel update will be:
Capacity: 0.100 Bitcoin
Can send: 0.100 Bitcoin
Can receive: 0.000 Bitcoin
**And now you spend some bitcoin, say 0.030 Bitcoin.**
The next channel update wil be:
Capacity: 0.100 Bitcoin (Stays the same)
Can send: 0.070 Bitcoin (Capacity - spend)
Can receive: 0.030 Bitcoin (Capacity - can send)
- **This are the options from the wallets, not from the LN network. LN nodes can accept incoming channel requests**. 
A LN node, can accept a incoming channel request, and accept that the other side fund the channel for 100%. 
This is what happens when you open the channel with Eclair or LN wallet. It's not that the wallets today, not accept incoming channel requests, that it's not possible on the network. 
**For LN Wallet: If you have no bitcoin and wish to open a channel:**
- I can send bitcoins to your LN wallet, using a standard bitcoin transaction.
- You use these bitcoins for open a channel to a LN node.
- You transfer the bitcoins back to me, using LN.
- You have now a open channel, and you can receive. (Again, minus the minimal fees)
There is a difference between the options available in a LN wallet, and the options available in the LN network.

A smart move is not to believe the vision form others, but, if you can, try it out for yourself.
Do you wish to have a honest view from the pro of contra from a coin, install the wallet, and use the coin.
Here the same for LN node. And the result will always be positive for the LN community.
Maybe he like the technology very much, and it's good for the network.
Maybe he try to find errors, and publish them. Also very good for the network. The devs know then which problems they have to solve first.

If you use Lightning app from android.
Open your Channel details. 
Click, lower right corner, orange ball with white B in.
Than select "View channel details".
You wil find 3 parameters:
- Capacity : x Bitcoin
- Can send: Y Bitcoin
- Can receive: Z bitcoin
Capacity = can send + can receive (X = Y + Z)
For receive the 65.000 sat, you have 2 conditions:
- Condition 1 : your capacity must be more than 65.000 sat. (X &gt; 65.000 sat)
- Condition 2: Can receive value : more than 65.000 Sat. (Z &gt; 65.000 sat)
If capacity is high enough, but the "can receive" value not, you have first to spend some sat, till your "can receive" value is enough.

But that is cultural.
I live in 2 continents.
In Europe, Belgium, when the kids go to school:
- For a snack, the school give the kids a snack, the kids can not buy it. The schools have removed all the "Un-healthy" snack dispensers.
- For a drink, the school give water. The schools have removed all the soda cola/fanta/sprite dispensers.
- For lunch, the kids eat home made sandwiches, or the school give them lunch. But no choice, you have to eat what the school give you. If you have home made sandwiches, some times the school check if it's healthy enough. No candy, no soda, no ...
At the end from the month, the school give the parents a bill, for all the extra snacks, drinks, food. The kids pay nothing in the school.
In Thailand, you give the kids lunch money. 
- For a snack, around the school, or on the school ground, you have a small market what sell al what kids like.
- For lunch, the kids can buy what they like. Or food prepared in the school, or snacks
- for drinks, the kids can buy what they like.
Europeans will than not understand why you give crypto to children, where in Thailand it will be accepted.

The opening and closing transactions are registered on the blockchain.
If you do 1 LN transfer, and than close the channel, you pay 2 records. That can be not so smart.
If you do 1 transaction, you better take standard bitcoin transaction. Than you only have 1 record on the blockchain.
My eclair Channel is open from begin april 2018.
My latest Lightning wallet  channel is now 1 week open.
With every LN wallet, you always can do standard bitcoin send/receive transactions.

I have the eclair wallet and the "Lightning wallet" used in the post.
When you open a channel, you will have the advice for connect to a node, not directly to a single friend.
Opening from the channel, 3 confirmations.
My channel from Eclair, is open from begin April 2018.
My channel from Lightning wallet is now a 3 weeks open.
Major difference:
- With eclair, I only can spend bitcoins, I can not receive. Slowly on, the funds on my channel start to dry out. I have than to open a new channel.
- With LN wallet, I can receive LN transactions. When I have spend some bitcoin, I can refill my Channel with receive some LN bitcoins.
- PS: both wallets can do standard bitcoin send and receive transactions.

You realise that 700 US$ is 2 or more monthly incomes in a poor country?

That makes than now 1.000 US$
@_date: 2018-07-12 05:15:55
Depends what you mean, with receive.
Your Lightning App have :
- A standard bitcoin wallet
- Your LN channel (wallet)
You always can receive a standard bitcoin transaction, and than open a channel.
If you mean, directly receive from LN, a node have to connect to you, and fund the channel for 100%. But I think that's not implemented for Android Eclair or LN wallet.
@_date: 2018-07-09 04:07:34
Because I don't like a direct channel to the place I want to transact with.
Imagine that the merchant is a weedshop, and I don't like that there will be a direct connection between me and the weedshop. I will connect than to a node, far away from the shop, and use LN routing.

**I think this is because you need an account with bitFlyer to be able to use Bitcoin at bic camera**, so bitFlyer takes on the risk. At least that was how it was when I checked there in April and found **I couldn't use Bitcoin directly**. 
If this is true, that you need a BitFlyer account, for do the transaction, than it's a fake 0-confirmation.
For BitFlyer it's than just database operation, from client account, to merchants account. 
And that have nothing to do with 0-confirmation. It's even not a real bitcoin transaction.

Problem is, how to convert fiat to crypto, and not have the name "exchange". Because for be an exchange, what accept fiat, you have to follow some local rules.
What you can do, use a product, with a variable price, and nobody can blame you that your prices are to high.
Nice example is art. You can place every price what you wish on (selfmade) art.
What you can try to do, create a small group of art-lovers. And you ask 5 US per year for membership.
If they pay 50 US%, they can rent an artwork from you, for a period from 3 weeks. If they like the work, you keep the 50US$. If they don't like the work, they send it back, and you refund in crypto. But you always wil work in a grey zone.

Question: Is there an option for increase the capacity from the the channel? I started with 0.001 BTC and like to increase to 0.002. Or only option is close the 0.001 channel and open a new 1 with 0.002 BTC?

A Bitcoin wallet can create a new Bitcoin address.
After the creation of the new address, does the wallet check if the address is unique or not?
Or the wallets trust the large possible numbers of addresses what make the chance to create an identical address almost impossible.

The combination of Bitpay and AT&amp;T is bad for newbies to change to BTC or BCH. People who already have BTC or BCH, and if they are in the Pro-Bitpay camp, will see it like an opportunity.
I will try to explain myself.
People in the crypto community promise crypto newbies that the advantages of crypto are :
- be your own bank, no 3rd person.
- Freedom of payments. You decide how, to who, and when you send crypto to.
- Cheaper prices if you compare with fiat, because the merchant doesn't have to pay credit card fee or other payment fees.
If the newbie compares this with the combination AT&amp;T and Bitpay.
The first problem, you have to pay a fee to buy BTC or BCH.
- No 3the person? : Bitpay replaced the banks. You give them your coin, and if they approve the transaction, they will exchange the coin to fiat, and transfer to fiat the merchant. And you have to pay a fee to do that.
- Freedom of payments? A lot of newbies start with multi-coin, easy desktop wallets, like Jaxx or Exodus, what doesn't work with Bitpay. Bitpay force you to use BIP70 wallets or specific Bitpay wallet. If you chose Bitpay Wallets, transactions to old BCH address, starting with a 1, are forbidden. In reality, no freedom of payments. 
- Cheaper prices when you use crypto? All the fees make paying with crypto more expensive than directly pay in fiat.
People already in crypto community, and who like BIP70, will be happy, and they will accept the higher price to pay with crypto.
Crypto newbies will never start with crypto if they are:
- be forced to use specific BitPay approved wallets (BIP70)
- to pay more than that they pay in cash.
If you really wish that newbies use crypto, the transaction has to be:
- Every wallet/address accepted
- Total crypto price cheaper that fiat

I found a medium file with some extra information.
Like I understand, you can send an receive Lightning Payments.
From the medium file:
This is how it works: 
- the user sends his bitcoins to a dedicated top-up address, and this balance is added to his account on LndHub. 
- Then, the user can use this balance to pay Lightning invoices. 
- But under the hood, it’s actually LndHub who pays the invoice, deducting the user’s account balance. 
- It works the same way when the user wants to receive a Lightning payment — it’s LndHub who creates Lightning invoice and actually receives coins on one of its channels.

The government can not stop people to use Bitcoin, but can force you to use a national currency.
Take for example some laws about payment of the remuneration in some countries in Europe.
- The remuneration should be paid in the currency provided for by law in country x for persons working in country x.
- In principle, the remuneration cannot longer be paid in cash (handed over) to the worker but must be paid in scriptural (non-cash) money (transfer into a bank account, cheques, etc.).
With these rules, the governments from, for example, BeNeLux or Germany, force the people to use the Euro.
And at the same time, they force you to use the banking system.

If you speak about a gift, or service, yes, then you are right.
But it is a dangerous statement, if you speak about trust and wallets.
It opens the door for replacing "in factory testing" with users testing.

And when the first users have found all the problems, I remove the free version and bring a paid version on the market.

It's a little bit like PC games.
Years ago, the programmers paid people, to test every game, before they brought it on the market.
Now they bring unfinished games on the market, and lett the users play it, and let them discover the problems. Hopefully, problems will then be fixed with regular updates or patches.
And for me, you can not do that with wallets and peoples money.
If a person installs the (Blue) wallet, and lose his Lightning channels and money, they will blame bitcoin and Lightning.
You will have groups of people, waiting that this happens, and then they will try to make news from it, Lightning not work, person x lost all his coins.
Be patient is ok, but the devs can then not bring the wallets out in the different stores, and lett newbies install and use them, before they are safe and functional.
It's not done, lett people take the risk, to lose their money.


I did the same. But after some time, no idea, which wallets I all used, and where are which coins.
That is why I decided, keep all on cold storage.
And for mobile wallet, only 1 or 2, per coin, what I completely trust.
I refill than my mobile wallets from the cold storage.

For really enjoy Bitcoin, yes, buy for 200 Euro, and:
- Place 100 Euro on your ledger, and use it as an investment. Don't touch it.
- Install a Lightning Wallet, like LN wallet.
- Transfer 50 Euro to the standard Bitcoin wallet.
- Open a channel for 50 Euro.
And enjoy spending bitcoins, standard transactions, and lightning transactions.

I love that part. You can not enough inform the people.
My crypto experiences fluctuate between love and hate. A few months ago, I sold almost all my coins, but now I start again.
And now I decided, a fresh start, and per coin, only 1 or 2 preferred mobile wallets. 
For Standard bitcoin, I selected Samourai.
For Lightning, I have Eclair and LN Wallet. (For LN wallet, you can have the same trust problems because they use the Olympus servers)
With LN Wallet I can receive LN payments, but I spend much more, than that I receive. My spending is around 15US$ per transaction.
BlueWallet toke my attention for:
- Do basic Bitcoin transaction to the BTC wallet
- Use these BTC for fund my BleuWallet Lightning Channel
- If needed, refill my LN wallet with a BLeuWallet Ln channel.
Other option is, if my LN wallet channel is empty, open new channel. 
I also use Jaxx and Exodus for windows.
Coinimi, BRD, and Wallet are in consideration.
For BSV, no decision token.
For Dash, Dash wallet
For Monero, Monerujo
For BCH, Bitpay

You are correct.
The problem is when you first discover the medium file:

And that's why, when I installed the wallet, I did have the idea, everything is working fine, with here and there some details.
But in reality, cannot receive on Lightning, wherein the medium file, they cleary explain how that they do it, give a bitter feeling.
