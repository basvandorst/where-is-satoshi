maybe I am wrong - but anybody with a little knowledge could do the job of money laundering through bitcoin once its widely accepted as payment method.
Only big financial institutions (huge banks) can launder money and not worry about going to jail (even when caught they just pay small fine, settle the case and continue business as usual)
they will not be able to take a huge cut the way they are now.

ok you are probably right.

I am all for creativity in advertising but this one is not hitting the right marks.
this is cult like behavior - and it can potentially make people see bitcoiners as a weird cult members.
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:31:18
also they would lose huge earnings that they make by laundering  money
@_date: 2019-07-28 21:34:47
IANAL but, and its just my opinion on matter,
I dont think you should start a post with "I have done this or that ..."
Its basically admittion of guilt 
maybe you should rephrase it to 
"I heard that you could do this or that but not sure ..."

but its bitcoin shirt
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:53:47
so sad I had to scroll this far down to find some common sense.
this is great way to make regular people (for lack of better term) hate bitcoin or bitcoin community.
this is cult like behavior and I am not sure bitcoin supporters want to be seen as a cult.
I am all for creativity in advertising but this one is not hitting the right marks.

easiest job ever - If you predicted it right, you are the king, and you get to say it at least twice every next few shows - if you predicted wrong you can not mention it, or even if you are called out on predicting wrong, there are millions of "unexpected factors" that you can point to as the reason for why your prediction did not come up as true. You can litterally just pick few reasons and stick to it, and nobody can say that they are not valid reasons.
**tldr**: its a casino - so you cant be wrong.

and be paid for it fairly - if somebody is not giving a shit about how well he is doing its job ... fire him, bring someone who will do the job to the best of his ability and see how much he will ask for his labor.
Do owners of the clubs and facilities have any responsibility for how society already looks like - or the criticism is only on the small guy doing the job?


hate to be the one to break it to you but yeah .... exactly.

then they should hire that person if he exists.
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:10:04
not if you are employee and need a fast money - its not your fault that position is up for grabs for anyone willing to take it because employer is too cheap to pay more - to create some competition for this position.

I was thinking in terms of larger amounts being kept in the bank - there is no point.
I understand having some money left in the bank so you can pay bills online (or spending it during month on whatever) for convenience sake.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:14:07


and he is doing exactly what he signed up for when he accepted the job for the money he is getting.
If employer is not happy he should find someone who will do the job better for same amount of money he is willing to pay.
As simple as that. You think he would be standing there doing the job the way he is doing it - if employer could find someone doing it properly for the money he is willing to pay?
@_date: 2019-11-17 10:09:32
and he is doing the job. low wage job = low wage effort.
@_date: 2019-11-20 23:16:55


I dont understand why people still keep money in the banks, and it has nothing to do with crypto.
It just makes no sense to keep any money in the bank.
@_date: 2019-11-17 12:46:48
"you get what you pay for"
is what people have been saying since forever.
explain me how that logic does not apply for low wage labor.

or its the one that will potentially get rekt and take the time to learn why he got rekt - and will teach his friends and family about bitcoin and how not to get rekt and what was his mistake that he did.
both scenarios (my or your) are equally plausible  - since we both are speculating here.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:10:31


you think he would be standing there, doing the job, if they could have hired someone more enthusiastic about the job for same money?
@_date: 2019-11-17 12:04:14
if they thought that its extremly important job to do maybe they should pay more and get some competent competition for the job.
you get what you pay for - right?
isnt that what people say when ou buy something cheap and complain that it does not work after a month (or whatever) ?
well same goes for job that you need to be done.
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:31:21
If you need the money, and they are offering you a job that nobody else wants for the amount of money they are paying, take the job and half ass it. 
Its up to employer to decide either to keep you at the job doing it however you are doing it, or to reconsider the amount he is willing to give for the job.

did you miss the part where I said 
*I am not using banks for crypto and never will.*

nobody has to use bank - but you cant stop people to hold their bitcoin in a bank if they choose to.
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:44:29
I am not using banks for crypto and never will.
Satoshi can write whatever he wants - does not mean that it will be followed by people. People decide how they use things.
take for example electric toothbrush - it was made with a purpose of washing your teeth.
did that stop girls to use it as a vibrator - no.
Same with bitcoin - if people want to put it in the bank or use it via banks - there is nothing anyone can do to stop them.

@_date: 2019-11-30 21:53:56
you simply dont know.
bitcoin or crypto in general is relatively new thing so legislation is still behind on this.
it will be introduced in next 5 to 10 years and then you will no for sure when all corrections are made.
If you are really thinking about moving - historically known tax-haven countries would be the best bet.
They will probably stay tax free even with crypto.

it means that jewelry sales are dropping down year by year, so they are trying to attract new clientele. 
they probably saw Lambo memes and thought that maybe they can make jewellery next meme thing, among people who use crypto.
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:07:49
no - but for the sake of fun lets go with your line
then the employer should be better at his job - hiring right people for the right job for the right amount of money - this employer is obviously incompetent.
Guy doing the job is not the one to be blamed - its fault of the employer that he hired him - he should really do his job better next time.

if you are investing in anything  without doing the research - you deserve to get rekt.
commercial, advertisement, banner .... for anything (any product) should not be considered as an order "go buy" , but as pointer "hey check out this new thing/product, go learn more about this and if you like it, we will be happy to sell it to you"

not everything is about you. 
there are plenty of religious people out there who want everything in their lives to be in harmony with their beliefs.
so basically this is good news for bitcoin in general.

lol - once you break into being multimillionaire or mulrimillion dollar worth company, you dont go to prison. 
you just buy yourself a team of lawyers and few politicians and you are good to go.
Just dont steal from other wealthy people - because then you may end up in jail.
but you can steal as much as you want from poor people and from government (money that poor people send to government in a form of tax) and nobody will care.
Prison is for poor people.

right now? nowhere definitely yet - but its a transition process. 
I am already using occasionally few platforms for watching videos, because some content that I used to watch on youtube had to move elsewhere for various reasons (demonetization, censorship, etc). 
Its mostly political or financial content or gaming or NSFW~ish content of various kinds (non-porn)
compared to just few years ago when I used Youtube almost exclusively for all videos - now its 50/50 (youtube vs other platforms)
Same happened with google (in my case) - I started looking for other search engines and in first few months I was still mostly using google 90% of the time. Right now I very rarely go to google - maybe once or twice a week and even that is only because their image search is still significantly better.
There is no hurry - if you decide to move away from google/youtube, nobody is forcing you to jump right away and never look back - take your time and find out if alternatives work for you better - use google/youtube interchangeably with alternatives for months if you want to.
@_date: 2019-12-26 07:53:16
what should we do about it? Beg Youtube for something?
Crypto/Bitcoin creators will not have other option but to move on elsewhere - and people who watch their videos will follow. 
If someone does not want your business - you go to someone who wants it.
And youtube has been changing in some weird direction for a while now.
Just let them go where ever they want to go and move on to another platform if you are looking for something else.

its enough to have few traders per city who will give (exchange) cuban currency for bitcoin. 
meaning tourists come in, exchange bitcoin for local fiat for a small fee and when others see that it works - people will start adopting bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-14 23:47:06


no wholefoods where I live - but that was not my point - point was that you can not just walk into any (or almost any) store and just buy things with bitcoin - and we are still far from that in most of the world.
so what people mostly need (for now) is to earn some bitcoin by working on internet (various small jobs) and then when you collect few hundred bucks (in bitcoin) you need an easy way to convert it to fiat so you can buy necessities.
In most countries its very hard to find someone who will buy your satoshis for local fiat currency - usually there is only one or two buyers in capital city   only and they are raping people with high fees.
I am talking about countries outside of Western world.

will be happy to once I can walk into supermarket and pay in bitcoin.
where I live its pain in the ass to convert it to fiat, not even to talk about paying for goods and services with bitcoin.
