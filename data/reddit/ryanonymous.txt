If he bought that today that plate could be what he paid....

well if these things are that important to people then they will pay for them voluntarily without coercion under threat of force by the state

oh my sweet summer child! the social contract? Really? That's almost as bad as a "muh roads" argument, also found in this thread! It's ok though, I know it's hard to face the truth of your sacred government being a violent criminal institution but you'll see the light one day. I just hope it's not too late by then.

naw man, $5k!
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:01:30
Holded? That doesn't even make sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:46:25
you condone stealing money from people under threats of force and *he* needs to grow up? That's rich. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:53:57
you mean the split that isn't happening?
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:17:43


indeed. special pleading grants moral authority to the state and exempts all others. this is fucked.


Can't help it. Being forced to abide by Government/public monopolies on services is NOT A FREE CHOICE. I'm not stealing money, the state is.


Again, I am not. The state is. Your arguments for statism are weak.

What? BCH *is* the original bitcoin blockchain, before the segwit cancer in came along in august. it's SegwitCoin and BlockstreamCore/B2x that's not innovative, no matter what says
@_date: 2017-11-01 09:03:21
i see you in here, fighting the good fight ;)
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:08:39


lol no. "They" forked in August and it created the current SegWit Shitcoin, BTC. BCH on the other hand kept going with the original rules and nothing has changed
@_date: 2019-01-13 19:58:06
haha not even close. A cent is one *hundredth* of a dollar. 1 Satoshi is one *hundred millionth* of a bitcoin. You are orders of magnitude off there
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:15:45
math is hard
