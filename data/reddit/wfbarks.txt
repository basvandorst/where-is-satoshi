Will the real Satoshi Nakamoto, please stand up? please stand up?

I disagree with you here, the fundamentals of bitcoin are its value proposition to everyone in the world that uses any kind of currency, and how it can offer them easy transactions with anyone else around the globe with low frictional costs. Additionally, its anonymity, and its potential role as a store of value.

If you were to do that, you would not be investing on fundamentals, but on technicals. So if you think you can time the market, then go for it.

Seems fair to look at it from that perspective as well. My underlying assumption here was that if you are thinking about bitcoin in terms of fundamentals you would expect demand for it to increase over time, not decrease. Price being a function of supply and demand, and supply being fixed over time, one would therefore expect the price to rise as demand increases, due to those fundamentals I mentioned (anonymity, reduced transaction, ease of transaction, and store of value)

I think he was a family friend who watched her grow up as a little girl. IMO he is just falling on a spear to try to make sure she knows that someone is sticking up for her. Totally not what she needs though.
