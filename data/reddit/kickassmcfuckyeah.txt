Sure send me one of your private keys over DM and it can be arranged. There needs to me a small balance on that key or it won't work.
(just so you know I was only making a stupid joke about my father; he is bill gates and would never buy apple stock)

Change? Fuck change! I am not interested in a bit of change. I want big bucks!

I recently send 400 euro from my Belgium bank accounts to my Canadian bank account using paypal. I used my Belgium bank credit card to transfer 400 euro to my paypall account. Fee was 12 euro. I got a 1% lower exchange rate then the one google showed me for EUR/CAD. So that's another 4 dollars. The money was instantly on my paypall account, then it took three days before it was on my Canadian bank account.
Doing this with bitcoin would have more or less been the same. Buying bitcoin with euro's using maestro and then sending them to a Canadian exchange is easy and fast. But then it will take some time before Canadian dollars are transfered from the exchange to my Canadian bank account. 
So Bitcoin is very usable right now as a way of storing value but not as a day to day means of paying money because there are no places around here where I can buy and pay directly with bitcoin.

Oh yeah well my dad bought 500 USD worth of Apple stock in 1999 and sold it in 2011 and bought bitcoin for it and now he has over a 100 millon USD. So I am not impressed.

The machine was worth 8000 dollars so the thief can ask the owner for half a bitcoin in return for the machine. Plus there was 350 euro in banknotes in the machine. So the thief still got something.

1) Step 1, have money
2) Step 2, buy a crystal ball or if really rich a timemachine
3) ?
4) Profit!

I still think Satoshi is John Nash (outside of the science community most known from a Beautiful Mind) who died a couple of years ago.

This sub needs some realism once in a while ... 
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:17:29
I still believe it's John Nash.

Bitcoin might be limited but makes it up with unlimited amount of shit. Seriously the whole reason this sub is literally exploding is because day trading on regulated exchanges with your actual bank account is impossible for a 16 year old gamer. But anybody can make an account on bitfinex! 
Bitcoin for a better world my and your ass. Bitcoin because I want to be rich too. Most people here don't give a fuck about anything else but the price in motherfucking benjamins. What goes up must come down and every penny somebody makes on an exchange is lost by somebody else. The amount of butthurt that is going to happen in the future is going be of unseen proportions. Incoming gox in 3,2,1 ...

i don't have any proof, just a hunch.
also nash died.

What does he mean with Netstumbler collecting passively?
As far as I know Netstumbler is a windows app similar to inSSIDer.
It shows wifi networks in range and their channels and stuff. It's nice for troubleshooting wifi. It does however NOT capture every single wifi packet you see. You would rather use a program like wireshark for that. And you need your wifi adapter in promiscuous mode, otherwise it will only do something with packets that are ment for that wifi adapter (with the mac address of the wifi adapter in them). promiscuous mode on windows is not easy. Only Airpcap (and derivatives like Acrylic wifi) can do it and not every wifi adapter is supported. 
Doing this under linux is so much easier but then your stuck using the command line and not a nice GUI like in windows. 
To me it sounds like this guy is trying to show of and brag. Using the right words but in the wrong context. If you look at more of his posts at  you will discover that this guy is a big wanne-be. A faker. Trying to get across like he has more knowledge then he really does. Kind of like trying to convince the world that he invented bitcoin.

No, it's just a way to turn binary files in to txt like stuff (ASCII) so you can use em with programs build for txt like email and usenet. 
Of course there are many more applications but this is one of the main ones.

Yes and the best possible way to explain public key cryptography and clock arithmetics  is using colors! Like this video does--&gt; 
Just get some paint and blow your audience their brains instead of melting it!  
I mean if you are going to explain bitcoin in a way that people can grasp what it's about then you might as well explain a tiny tidbit of the cryptographic spectrum. After all bitcoin is all about hashes of public keys and private keys.

yeah the market is a bit smarter then these ass-clown journatruthrapers and the 70% here that talks bitcoin without owning a single cent or at least never bought anything with bitcoin.

They love robots and so they probably also love robot money.

Now I need to know how SWIFT works. If money is transferred digitally without any coins or bills actually moving ... can you not just roll back mistakes? Or are there rules in place that prevent this? 
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:28:28
Because the majority of people here have never used bitcoin at all. Then there is a smaller but still big group that have never even owned any bitcoin. And a very small group that knows anything about programming. And a super small group that knows cryptography. I can write a bitcoin article full of techno babble and 4 only 4 out of 40 comments would call me out.

he invented game theory. bitcoin is an practical experiment in a zero trust network. it currently only keeps people cooperating because of the financial incentive. classic game theory.

I want to be the second person that downloaded the first version of bitcoin that he released! I am also taking as many  GPU's and a good GPU bitcoin miner with me back in time.
