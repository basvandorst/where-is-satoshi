I'm too lazy to read two pages for an april fool's joke.  What's the punch line?
Ok, so after looking at the comments I think my result was random but it made it maybe the best joke ever.
So it links to Rick Astley obviously, pretty quality setup, good joke.  But the ad that ran before the video for me was for Jesus Christ Superstar!  Seriously, if that was intentional it was fucking brilliant.

I agree but I think there's an argument to be made that encouraging early adopters to learn as much as possible in order to educate the masses a bit more thoroughly later would be very beneficial.
Sure the average Joe doesn't give a fuck about the technicals but the average Joe has never used cryptocurrency. 
If you're reading this you are an early adopter. 
If you only came into the space for lunar lambos, that's fine, but you're still here. 
Prices have dropped drastically while the fundamentals have either not changed or improved. This bear market is a time to learn.
Educating yourself as much as possible as soon as possible in every aspect is only going to give you an advantage later (even if it's in an unexpected way).
