you mean a miner fee. and it's not dependent on the wallet. it's dependent on the bitcoin network itself. because there is limited space per block (1MB), there is a high demand for getting transactions confirmed.

It's sad that a level-headed discussion about these topics can no longer be had on this forum. right now there are 36% upvotes :(
OP made some really good points, and asked questions others definitely have.

welcome to r/bitcoin, this is the help you get from pompous assholes just trying to get rich.

I love coming to the Bitcoin community and them telling me to use LTC because it's better. What has this place become?

why the intense animosity to coinmarketcap? did i miss something, or do you need to calm down?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:17:02
the wallet designers probably expect the users to expect cryptocurrency transactions to be instant... because that's how they're supposed to work. 
you can't blame the devs of a wallet for trying to get your transaction confirmed in time. blame the 1MB blocksize limit and the repeated delays of lightning network

No change from 17 days ago? So excite.

But one of the segwit/bitcoin developers told me not to use Segwit until Lightning is ready... I'm confused.

i've been using electrum for years and i've never seen this.
But, i looked up how to stop paying the fees, and the solution is to restore your wallet from your seed and do NOT enable 2fa by this 3rd-party service.

that's bitcoin, not exodus.

what value does a reduction in blocksize offer, besides de-incentivizing full peers?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:04:08
i suggest to find local meetups at meetup.com or something, if you happen to live or visit a relatively big city. people tend to be more considerate when face-to-face. haven't tried the bitcointalk forums in a while myself, maybe i should look there again.
i also share your skepticism about lightning network. while I also love the tech behind it and find it to be a really clever micropayment channel network, there are some great assumptions about it without any great evidence to back them up.


The only comparable case we have so far is Segwit, and the adoption rate nowhere near matches the enthusiasm about it from this community. Segwit is at a 10% adoption rate after 3 months, therefore giving bitcoin an effective blocksize increase of 5% at best. If it's so great, why aren't all wallets and exchanges adopting it? Those 12-word phrases you write down were an improvement, and quickly became the standard without any urgent network-scalability need. So why is Segwit so.. *meh*?


**This** is my biggest concern. I loved seeing the [successful simulations]( performed on LN models, and I read a lot of the documentation to get my head around what it's doing, and I like it. But everything is about what happens **within** the lightning network, not how people are actually going to use it. We don't know how often people would like to open and close channels. With transaction fees getting ridiculously high, only the richest hodlers will be able to regularly open and close channels, while those with few coins will likely have to join long-term LN nodes that are well-connected to other nodes already open, making it very difficult for the poor to move their money.
We don't know how people are using bitcoins. I only know how I used them when it made sense. It was often, if not always, a one-off random transaction when i felt like it. Micropayment channels will only help lower fees for everyone if theyre adopted by massive institutions, if that's where most of the transactions are coming from. Again, we have a centralization problem rearing its head. 
It's hard for me to get a clear answer to these issues. i get instead, argumentative assholes saying im a shill or am spreading fud. since 2013... i want btc to win. i want it to be the best fucking thing the world has ever seen. i'm not working against it by expressing these views.

Nobody on the Bitcoin cash side is hoping for sub-cent transactions to be on-chain.
Sub-cent transactions are what Micropayment channels are for. This was never meant to be solved by Bitcoin cash. I remember micropayment channels being promoted for Bitcoin before we needed any fees or confirmations.

I never had gold before but was thinking if the btc price goes up again im gonna trade it into gold for something different.

This helped a lot. Thank you. I will consider this much more in the future.

Thank you for posting this. It's a great way to get caught up on all the drama that occurred over the last years. I've been a bitcoin user since 2013 and as soon as this debate started, I stayed silent. However, lately I've been very confused at the emotions and logic of both sides, but more at the r/bitcoin or pro-core side. I would really appreciate it if you could clear some things up for me, since you have a good historical understanding of what has happened here.
First of all, this thread isn't going to see the light of day since it's being downvoted to oblivion, so if I were a paid shill, I'd be wasting the miners' money here. I really want you to help me understand a few things by explaining to you how I really am a real grassroots supporter of big block sizes, and how you saying we're fake is a slap in our face.
Secondly, I will admit that I come from an emotional side of argumentation, as I've been a fan of bitcoin for so long.
Ok, here goes, point-by-point:
I am a Bitcoin USER. As a Bitcoin USER, when I started noticing my transaction fees skyrocketing and confirmation times taking longer than ever, this angered me. All of the reasons I told people to use Bitcoin were no longer valid. So when you say,


...I get angry again. I supported a block size increase because it was the most common-sense approach to alleviate (not solve) the current problems. The so-called downsides are backed by no empirical evidence, only speculation (very few people used the Core client, as it was ALREADY too slow and had no end-user benefits compared to thin/SVT clients such as Electrum). I also did not see any connection that a ruling class would more easily install itself because of bigger blocks, this still sounds ridiculous to me, just like when you say...


First of all, I am a USER. I am a selfish USER. And yet, I support the miners? No. I support what makes Bitcoin the most useful for me, the USER: Low transaction fees and fast confirmations. But in a way, you're right. I do support the miners right to decide what changes get adapted to the platform because that is how it is stated in the Satoshi Nakamoto whitepaper entitled, "Bitcoin: A peer-to-peer cash system." The whole UASF thing was a slap in the face to the entire idea of Bitcoin, as it changed the rules of the game by changing how the rules can be changed. If anything was an attack, it was that.
.... Sorry, let me calm down and get to my point. I gathered these opinions not from Mike Hearn (I was skeptical of that guy sine the beginning), or r/btc (just another side to a lesser-of-evils match). I gathered these opinions by reading r/bitcoin, and how so many people here were changing what bitcoin meant, yet claiming to be the champions of bitcoin. 
My point: I don't know how to scale bitcoin. I don't believe in either side's current changes as long-term solutions for global scaling of bitcoin. What I DO believe is that:
* the Core/Blockstream method is so complicated and over-engineered, that it will make the INEVITABLE attempts of a takeover / co-opting of Bitcoin much more difficult to identify, while at the same time **changing the design of bitcoin** via UASF, Segwit, Off-chain aka Non-bitcoin scaling
* and the Big-blocker method stays true to the original spirit of the design of bitcoin (reminder: no blocksize limit was in place when Satoshi invented it), that it will make the INEVITABLE attempts of a takeover / co-opting of Bitcoin **easy to identify**, so that **competing miners can keep the network honest**. 
We both fear centralization. You see it in miners. I see it in developers (Blockstream). Satoshi devised ways of incentivizing honesty within the Bitcoin network, NOT outside of it.
P.S. ... Please attack my post however you see fit. I have purposely made some provocative statements here because that's how I feel and that's how I can learn.

Do you really think many people are dumb enough to think that somebody is selling their bitcoin for $600 when the price is clearly $7000?
You may not want to admit this, but there probably is a demand for BCH, just like I don't understand why there's a demand for LTC. Accept the market. It may be crazy sometimes, but that same market is why we're at $7000.

I will hope you will make a more thoughtful post than that. Because if you think you DO know how to scale Bitcoin, you're foolish. Even the beloved Andreas Antonopolous stated, ["Scaling is not something you solve, but continuously aspire to push back as a frontier."](
If you don't make a more thoughtful post, then I haven't wasted my typing. I'll just start to write more elsewhere, and future googlers landing here will see that I'm correct.
