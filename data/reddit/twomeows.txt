Perfect username.

Extremely negative.

What you are describing is "sunk cost", not opportunity cost. The retrospective analysis of a choice in one of two options in the same instrument (ie: to sell/hold or to buy/not) is sunk cost in the first example and a simple decision on the second. 
The option to choose an alternative instrument or investment, and the potential outcome of that investment relative to the one you chose is opportunity cost.

You're not making a point. Not selling at $20k and buying at $20k yield the same loss in the abstract...okay? What's your point? You may as well say "the price went down $14,000." That's about twice as meaningful as your "point" and a fourth of the words. 
In reality, if you bought anywhere lower than $7k, you made a profit - not as much as it could have been - but your ACTUAL investment appreciated in value. 
If you bought anywhere near $20k, you've lost over half your principal. So whats your point?

Because in order to make the decision of whether or not to sell BTC at $20k, one would have had to buy it before it hit $20k. So the sunk cost of those who bought at $20k will always exceed the sunk cost of those who simply didn't sell at $20k.

That's not opportunity cost lol.  At this point I'm honestly 60% sure you're trolling me.

No...it's not the same. That's completely wrong and retarded. IF you bought at $1k for $100, and you bought again at $20k for $100 - your average price is $10500. You're down $67 today. 
If you bought in at $1k for $100, then NOT selling at $20k still means you profited $600. 
So no, you're wrong.

That literally makes no sense and i'm hoping it is some sort of theme account idiosyncrasy

You're so convoluted I can't even unpack this succinctly enough to show you how stupid it is. 
Your original point was that NOT selling at $20k had the same implications as BUYING at $20k. Now that I proved how that is wrong, you switched to saying that they both would incur the same opportunity cost, which is also wrong - because the two circumstances differ drastically by nature the differences between buying and selling. 
This is a horrible conversation and I hope you're ashamed of yourself. I have a degree in Finance, I know what opportunity cost is.

Literally makes no sense. If I buy at $20k my average cost is 20k. Today i've lost over half my investment. If I bought at 1k and didn't sell at 20k, i'm still up 7x...
