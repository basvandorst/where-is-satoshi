So what
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:42:01
You deserve to lose money for making this tired, overused comment
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:46:55
Seriously. Wonder what rent cost is and how many people are needed to run the operation
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:31:42
Seriously. Who knew looking at numbers could be more entertaining than the Superbowl

I don't know whats happening either way, but people have to sell into something... So the fact that tethers chart is the opposite of other cryptos doesn't seem that weird to me. What else would people sell into? USD isn't a trading pair on a lot of exchanges that offer alts, so the only "safe haven" is tether afaik.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:49:39
all in all, your sell orders just another brick in the wall
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:23:14


Best part of the article.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:28:46
Better than any movie thats come out in the last 2 years. This is INSANE
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:01:44
What? But it's so easy to rent a movie on iTunes, Amazon, google play, etc... How is it difficult for you?
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:38:29
Stop making this stupid joke.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:55:44
I don't get why the block chain makes this any different than googles current model aside from posing major scaling issues for them. People can already stream HD movies almost instantly with good internet, the rental is only good for a set amount of time, and all of these rental companies are collecting analytics. Block chain only makes this more difficult. The ridiculous infatuation with any technology that relates to "block chain" is mind blowingly naive to me. Trust matters when storing your money because your life kind of depends on it. Who is scared that Google is gonna rip them off and feels the need to audit rental charges by referencing a block chain? Insanity.

his forecast is that bitcoin will always be better than the USD bro, don't let this FUD cloud your judgment the lightning network will rain cash down on all of us. all hail bitcoin. sunnier days lay ahead of us boys 
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:20:07
The replies to you here are cringeworthy. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:28:23
What is the expected roi with something like this, assuming you are apart of a pool?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:20:33
Wondering the same thing. People exiting alts have to do it through btc/eth/ltc/bch. Creates an interesting dynamic
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:03:08
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:30:43
You think that it was manipulated to stay under 13k or manipulated up from the correction?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:44:27
What are their trade fees going into cash? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:08:11
Coinbase distributed the BCH fork.. They, at this point, aren't supporting BTG. Would be curious to know if transferring to a wallet could allow a Coinbase Bitcoin to actually get BTG though.. It's basically free money 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:46:27
What? Really? To what end? Ie if I come from Britain back to the US and the dollar has performed better than the pound since I've been gone, do I pay capital gains when I exchange left over pounds for $?

What is the implication of his mid-life career change?
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:07:53
Thought so. Bummer 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:39:48
What gave you the "a ha" moment?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:46:45
If somebody wanted to hangs BCH for btc, why not just sell BCH on GDAX for cash and then repurchase btc for that cash? Do you really think the inability to trade coin for coin is propping the price up?
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:15:16
I understand your argument, but any human being in the US can work for about 10 hours and make $100. Though it relatively may be more of a college students net worth, accessibility to $100 is pretty easy. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:47:23
What security would making a large purchase with Bitcoin offer you vs cash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:37:56
Bummer man - even still? Luckily I only did .0001 BCH transfer to binance last night to test it out (and it took a little while, which was a bit scary). I was able to sell on GDAX about 30 min ago. Watching the charts is crazy exciting rn
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:09:10
Can't people sell BCH now by transferring to binance and exchanging for btc?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:27:16
Yes, I am an idiot 
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:40:27
When was it released?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:06:41
I agree - I find it hard to wrap my mind around how certain things other than money can be decentralized with the block chain. Any enlightening thoughts about that specifically? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:50:16
Are there fees to go from binance to GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:15:05
If not, it would mean there is a massive problem. Good to know
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:30
When did you buy in? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:40:22
Ive seen so many people post about being annoyed that they can't buy on Coinbase because "it keeps going up." Maybe these posts were all between 11am and like 11:10am (when it actually did go up)? 
Lots of people are very lucky they can't buy on Coinbase for the time being. Happy to have gotten out at 3650. Today is a very exciting day to be watching charts 
If and when Coinbase opens up purchasing, I wonder how they plan to avoid the massive ramp up in price due to an influx of market orders (and by massive ramp up I mean a user hitting purchase when it's at 3800 only to have their order filled at 5k+). I imagine that's what happened last night..
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:10:03
Any links to a guide on how to get BTG by getting a Trezor and transferring Coinbase Bitcoin over? Basically could get a free Trezor (when factoring in the gains from getting free BTG)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:00:32
Wow.. That is extremely strange
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:02:38
It wasn't "free"
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:33:17
Who the hell cares. Waste of mental energy to think about a ridiculous scenario that will absolutely 100% never happen.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:29:32
The stupid is palpable
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:12:29
lol you're a troll right? You can't be this ridiculous and actually believe what you're saying. Of course in the stock market for every sale, there is a buyer. If there was no buyer, there couldn't be a sale. The price of the most recent sale sets the price for the stock/crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:32:55
Yeah that's totally what's holding 700 billion wannabe-invested-in-crypto dollars from entering the space. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:15:28
The only thing you said that is different than 4 years ago is the number of alternatives. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:35:29
There are easily as many morons posting about HODLing as there are posting about selling.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:50:30
Supposed to make you think for what purpose? Its a waste of mental energy. Completely. There is as much value in pondering your scenario as there is in pondering "what if all peanut butter on earth actually became dollar bills worth 1 trillion dollars? what would happen to the economy?"
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:12:21
I think the way exchanges work makes this extremely difficult if not impossible, unfortunately. It would def be interesting though. Also, I could be wrong
