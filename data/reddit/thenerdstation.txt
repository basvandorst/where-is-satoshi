The "litepaper" hasn't been released, so we do not know what kodak is planning on doing. This article argues that what they plan on doing requires them to store the image on the blockchain.

What are you talking about? BTC is up 15% this week!
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:07:26
I hope to have something just as impressive a year from now

The transfer times are too long for it to be safe. Especially since the prices can change dramatically during the transfer time.

Unless [P=NP](

The world will change so drastically that the internet will become a footnote overnight. I wouldn't even bother trying to dump them if P=NP. Credit card transactions and online banking won't be secure either.

I agree with you. But we are about to see...

Pretty good. Bought some litecoin at taco bell at $190. Payment didn't go through, so bought again. ended up accidentally buying twice, but then it went up 30% today anyway so I'm not even mad.

Are you going to provide a reason why or just continue to throw baseless ad hominems?
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:43:46
well now we know where you go to college dipshit
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:07:32
So like last week?

Zcash? Not sure to be honest. Most FPGAs are built to do exactly one thing and do it really really fast. Depending on what part is software vs hardware you might be able to salvage it for something that uses the same hash algorithm. But otherwise, sorry. Not much you can do with it.

Get a custom wallet not on coinbase. If you really want to use coin base, buy it there, but then transfer the money. If you want to be extra secure, there are lots of trade mixing websites so your initial movement can't be tracked.

London Futures start selling
@_date: 2018-05-20 15:35:13
Yeah, no. Unless they sign a message with the private key they're just trolling. Anyone can send bitcoins to that address.

The difficulty adjustment code wise is fairly easy to fix, the problem is adoption. Any adjustment would be a hard fork, causing anyone who doesn't upgrade their node to not be able to correctly validate blocks. Infact, the implementation of the difficulty change already has a bug compared to it's description. Satoshi wanted the difficulty to be readjusted every 2016 blocks, but the code has an off by one error and only does it every 2015. The bug is minor but would be incredibly difficult to fix, so the devs decided to leave it.

To this guy, who sold me BTC at 6k. All I have to say is.
Thanks. I'm back in the green.
