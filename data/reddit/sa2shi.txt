I don't really think so either.

Going to be tough with no money.
@_date: 2016-08-26 01:05:43
Confused the shit out of me as well.
@_date: 2019-07-16 14:29:51
Agreed, I think it was also mostly fueled by the ICO frenzy. This is coming from someone who's 25% eth.
@_date: 2019-07-18 13:03:49
Lol amazing. I'm surprised he sent.
@_date: 2019-07-19 14:09:15
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:07:51
Why are the exchanges closed?
@_date: 2019-07-17 19:28:21
Wow Meltem Demirors is doing a fantastic job.
@_date: 2015-12-04 01:39:04
How much was in it?
@_date: 2015-12-18 00:24:22
So why would anyone pay 9%
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:56:59
False alarm.
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:25:03
Well, when he was on the panel he did state "I have so many I forget what ones". As if that wasn't a give away.
@_date: 2015-12-16 14:37:42
@_date: 2015-12-17 23:44:16
Especially since there are a ton of LibertyX locations right near it that charge 1%.
@_date: 2015-12-18 23:58:00
Geez, that audio quality.
@_date: 2015-12-17 13:42:36
I also don't see many of these banks interacting much, if at all with the bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:55:44
OB has moderators?
@_date: 2015-12-02 04:30:32
About time.
@_date: 2015-12-11 19:24:41
Who said anything about MMM?
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:51:48
@_date: 2015-12-18 18:03:45
It's not THAT bad.
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:30:27
Can confirm. has always been 100% instant for me.
@_date: 2015-12-17 14:17:17
Welp, that's one assumption.
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:47:18
You were using them to store bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-01 06:30:07
Can someone fill me in on the neobee story?
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:42:28
I mean.... on a $5 transaction that is literally the same % fee. $0.50 fees is still a problem. I wouldn't be so sarcastic just yet.
@_date: 2016-01-04 23:40:16
that's not 20?
@_date: 2016-01-01 19:00:00
Had to do this same thing ^^ I also had to wipe it and re-enter my seed, so make sure you have it backed up.
@_date: 2017-03-31 23:30:59
Haha, you got me.
@_date: 2016-01-10 15:49:12
On this page:  I have a link entitled "redeem bitcoin" under my payment methods. Although I am a US customer.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:23:54
EHHH I'll wait a few weeks till the price drops due to this drama.
@_date: 2016-01-06 20:52:30
Expect your account closed soon "kushman".
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:28:11
So are  99% of altcoins.... doesn't make them not crypto. I was heavily involved in alts to start as well. Doesn't make me less of a bitcoiner than you.
@_date: 2016-01-09 21:40:24
why "not another" ?
@_date: 2016-01-03 01:17:39
@_date: 2017-03-06 18:35:26
All the way back to their bitinstant investment. Thanks guys!
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:20:49
You sir, just earned a downvote.
@_date: 2016-01-05 02:46:07
No one asked you. We're ranting.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:02:54
Yeah, 1% I believe.
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:43:14
Still here ^
@_date: 2016-01-10 19:07:24
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:58:52
And years old...
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:30:33
K sorry, your right. Dodge was not a cryptocurrency.
edit: Replied to the wrong person, sorry.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:46:54
That's stupid. I've used them with bitcoin over 10 times. Once the integration is done it literally takes 0 extra work? I don't get why they would remove it.
Only think I could think of is customer support issues. Bitcoin would take special knowledge at a CSR level, although they did go through coinbase so probably just forwarded all requests their way?
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:22:02
coinbase's merchant integration doesn't require upgrades.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:05:14
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:54:05
I thought India shut down zebpay?
@_date: 2019-03-28 17:52:57
Yeah.. shit article.
@_date: 2017-03-15 21:18:18
He doesn't code at all? News to me. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:45:50
This type of trash makes it to the front page now?
@_date: 2016-06-24 23:43:04
Nice work core!
@_date: 2016-01-07 21:55:18
Have you checked if there was a LibertyX store nearby? It's as easy as getting a amazon gift card. 
@_date: 2016-12-01 15:36:11
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:59:13
LibertyX.com 
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:41:43
Sounds like he wants what's best for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-29 14:43:23
Shoooot, I'd be happy with changing it to 1.5 for now.
@_date: 2016-11-28 19:42:24
Here's a demo: 
Pretty sweet.
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:54:50
Trace pulling numbers out his ass again.
@_date: 2016-12-06 15:56:18
Nice! we need [LibertyX]( type services in other countries too. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 17:18:49
@_date: 2016-12-01 19:14:08
Ehh, this is more equivalent to leaving a negative yelp review of the restaurant after.
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:09:20
Yet they respond within a hour of his reddit post. Clearly he did the right thing.
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:50:14
Or both?
@_date: 2016-12-01 18:08:42
@_date: 2016-12-01 20:08:48
Agreed, although I think it's a good thing people keep posting these. It makes the company more accountable for crappy support.
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:45:41
So... your the reason...
@_date: 2016-12-04 16:57:50
Because scams should be ousted.
@_date: 2016-11-29 00:46:40
all reddit accounts over 3 months are clearly bought
@_date: 2019-10-31 19:39:16
I forgot all about it. Enjoyed this recap.
@_date: 2016-12-05 14:43:18
Really? I assumed it was hard coded as well. Have never saw otherwise.
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:01:13
Glad to see these finally popping up, I remember the announcement late last year.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:18:01
Consider his account closed.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:57:32
altcoin discussion not allowed... unless...
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:04:17
lol he talked about it in the episode with the barstool guy too
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:27:18
It's a common misunderstanding that you need a whole bitcoin to play. Bitcoin is already divisible by 8 decimal places. We refer to 0.00000001 as 1 Satoshi.
If the price kept rising to a point where 1 Satoshi was no longer viable we could break it up further. Keep in mind, if 1 satoshi equals $0.01 one day, that means 1BTC = $1,100,000.00.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:47:18
This is also interesting: 
Hope to see more of that.
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:58:49
So annoying that those pop up after each tweet he makes.
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:59:34
No, they spent 0 time getting ready for BCH. They said if it still has value, they will worry about it next year. They never added btg, and s2x didn't happen.
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:23:42
If you are exchanging BTC in your account to FIAT there is a fee. 
If you go to gdax.com click deposit and send your BTC from coinbase to gdax, you can post a sell order on the exchange and not pay any fees as long as you are a maker (you post a sell order, not just sell to someone's buy order)
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:57:59
Coinbase doesn't care because the customer pays the TX fee.
BUT, GDAX pays the fee on BTC withdrawals. If we all start to use gdax for withdrawals they'll start to feel some pressure.
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:44:12
So you sign us up for an exchange we are supposed to trust to hold our money while bank transfers clear, and we're not allowed to know who it is?
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:32:36
Hmm, so who holds the bitcoin while the customer funds are waiting to settle with your banking partners?
@_date: 2017-04-21 23:20:57
Do the users have to agree to also becoming a user of the exchange, or even get to know who the exchange is? That seems super important if they're holding our funds.
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:23:06
Coinbase is legal, and has licenses so less likely to get your funds frozen.
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:57:56
So do you setup exchange accounts for all of us users? Or is it an exchange account you control? If it is an abra exchange account, aren't you effectively controlling/holding the funds?
Sorry, I don't see this explained in the terms, and would like to learn more before testing you guys out.
@_date: 2017-04-18 23:39:19
On a side note... jeez bitpay, that's a hell of a markup.
@_date: 2017-04-21 21:06:39
I noticed you left out the licenses part in your reply. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:01:56
Also worth a few grand.
@_date: 2017-04-20 16:06:40
Thought this meant pays it's employees 20x.
@_date: 2016-09-29 13:22:33


@_date: 2016-09-02 16:23:33
Was going to give them a try, but the cashier said they only accept cash. Might go back later.
@_date: 2016-09-13 19:18:39
Coinbase usually takes 4-5 days to give me a "explanation". I doubt poloniex, being a shady exchange, will do any better.
@_date: 2016-09-14 14:20:20
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:28:05
Coinbase app lets you. It works really good.
@_date: 2016-09-27 14:53:14
If you have a bank account and don't mind waiting a few days: [Circle.com](
If you live in a city there is probably a [LibertyX]( location near you that lets you buy instantly with cash.
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:07:11
Nice stuff. I've never had a problem with Circle, other than a low limit.
@_date: 2016-09-08 16:41:42
How much was it? Complying with regulations and laws does not make them a scam btw. You have to expect this kind of stuff the first time you use an account based in the US.
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:33:40
STILL?! AFTER 30 MINUTES?! WHAT GIVES. POLONIEX?!
@_date: 2016-09-13 18:29:49
Says who?
@_date: 2016-09-27 00:50:13
OB offers 0%. Why should we choose rocketr over them?
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:12:24
Or less popular? If there's no other content.
@_date: 2016-09-01 13:35:30
New York?
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:07:12
Sick looking store.
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:05:43
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:57:42
Yeah, been loading up my xbox live account for years now. Still cool though.
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:00:42
Gets posted once a month
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:49:31
Until you realize they don't actually have an app released since they spend more time ranting on twitter.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:58:16
I mean, a lot of talking and not much else. They've had an android only wallet in a betta for months now from my understanding?
Granted I usually agree with much of what they say, but pretty cocky for having nothing to offer.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:14:01
that logo....
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:34:00
Posted it on his twitter after.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:57:37
These guys do a lot of talking.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:13:59


@_date: 2018-12-20 14:34:42
What api does it use? Or is it it’s own service. I prefer the ones already out there that use big name api’s to verify the transaction
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:44:40
Welp, I did also..
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:09:43


So they clearly got it. I think he just meant it isn't showing in his account.
@_date: 2017-06-01 14:08:30


That is no where in his post?
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:21:41
Yes... OP is reaching. Posts like this will just fuel the trolls.
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:46:28
Wires do not take days to clear like ACHs do.
@_date: 2018-12-31 03:05:06
Great tool, thank you.
