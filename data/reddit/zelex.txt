As long as I keep seeing these posts, I know we haven’t actually hit bottom and are probably nowhere near it. ;)

The law protects you from retro-active effects. If you previously donated to snowden your fine. (but if they violate that you would have to sue them to show that they couldn't... and since they have all your stuff you wouldn't have the funds to fight them).

Believe it or not, this Bitcoin stuff will eventually get resolved and when it does the price will bounce back. And all those people who sold due to uncertainty will be kicking themselves.

I know that seems like common sense, but here's why I think you may be wrong. The speed of deflation will level out and the total pool of bitcoins will stabilize. So in effect there will be little inflation or deflation, It will be a flat currency. (Which is not a bad thing IMO)

in a true free market, you are wrong. With lots of competition, the quality of your service highly affects your profit (more than anything else).

I'm pretty sure that according to the original constitution taxes were voluntary and not mandatory.

That buy may turn out to be the smartest buy you ever made. Sit on it until it appreciates.
