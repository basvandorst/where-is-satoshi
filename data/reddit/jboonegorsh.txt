Here's the fun part:
Where's the line of what's too crazy to believe anymore?
I always leaned toward the "conspiracy" side. Now I have no idea what's possible.  And I have a degree and work in IT.

The problem is that I can't not be governed.  Give me the option to reject social security, WIC, federal healthcare exchanges, taxes, etc... and we'll be fine.
But that won't work, because for the "less fortunate" to get helped, you've gotta force me to help them (supposedly. I pay state and federal taxes, and who the fuck knows what happens after that).  There wouldn't be enough people to keep things afloat otherwise.
Teamwork is a misnomer because you voluntarily join teams.  Democracy as we've implemented it is coercion because I can't not be on your team.  And the list of things I can't not be is always growing.
If you don't find that a little messed up, just on principle? We've got no common ground to work off of.

I haven't seen this episode yet, but I'm not surprised really.
I really like this show, but right from the first episode, I felt like it had an agenda.  It seems to glorify police militarization, and Kennex (or whatever the hell his name is) seems only able to do a good job as a cop when he "violates the crap out of people's civil rights", to quote Dorian's assessment.
Even the 5th episode had Stahl bending the rules of legality.  All to save people, so it's totally okay. The little catch phrase in the opening makes me twitchy: "And now all police, man and machine alike, take up the fight to watch over us all" /vomit.
Having not seen it, I assume they're doing something like associating bitcoin with criminal activity in the audience's minds... yeah?
