Inviting Roger Ver in interview was no half-baked decision from CNBC. They know full well who he is, what he stands for, and they know what Bitcoin Cash is. They know who Andreas Antonopoulos is and what Bitcoin is.
They are the media; a bunch of vultures looking to create a maximum of chaos to then feed on the results, just like they feed on every mass shooting that happens in US. They certainly will not interview Andreas, for they have no interest in doing so. Their aim is to turn us towards one another. 
Don't take them for a bunch of fools, they know what they are doing and they are very apt at doing it.

How it feels to buy high and sell low
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:31:30
This is big.

Using Circle right now for buying bitcoins, but now i'm obviously going to switch my method to something else. Anyone can recomment a good alternative while buying from credit card?

Totally fine. Actually you'd better feel like a champ, cuz if you're starting out, buying only a fraction is super safe. Yet you can gain on the long therm, as bitcoin ain't going away anytime soon.
You did a reasonable move and can keep buying on a regular basis.

It's fucking great

Lookup Andreas Antonopoulos for a good start. He's the bitcoin explainer.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:05:53
I don't love him and i don't hate him. But that's  good advice :)
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:48:46
You know it's pulling back, because the crooks that pump it are what they are: crooks.
Ver is not to be trusted anymore. But this is what is interesting with the bitcoin community. Not only does the code strengthens over time, the list of trustworthy people also gets updated.

The way i understand it, i think it's important that post-fork, we get the exchanges to label the original bitcoin as BTC and the segwit2x bitcoin as B2X or whatever else.
Because yes, segwit2x is an attack. Maybe we can see that as a test that simply will allow bitcoin to strengthen itself.

Very nice zen tweet from my shaman Andreas. Why do people always need a black or white? A winner and a loser? We're going into 2018. We're past that immaturity level, as a species, i think.
I agree with him and think the two curencies will coexist.

Do not leave your currencies on exchanges.

take some seeds and put em in the ground behind your house or something; free food will grow and thus you will need money a lot less
