Was about to buy something on Purse.io when mycelium showed this estimated fee. I thought 25¢ fees for Bitcoin transactions were already too high but $1.28? I'm not paying 7.86% fee to send Bitcoin. I think I'm just going to pay with my debit card because Bitcoin is too expensive now.

Buying and sending as you need it also negates the extreme cold storage methods some people take and you'll have no bitcoins held for an exchange to run off with.

This is what I'm not understanding. I have most of my BTC on my trezor but I keep a small everyday spending amount in Mycelium on my Android phone. I have the recovery seed (the private key?) written down when I first setup Mycelium. So if I don't move these BTC on Mycelium (≈$30) they will suddenly become useless if there is a fork?
