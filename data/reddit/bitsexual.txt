I get what you’re saying about buying power, which is true. However you are not accurate in your comparison that “1 USD = 1 USD” because the monetary supply of USD is theoretically infinite while the supply of BTC will never exceed 21,000,000 BTC. That’s it. And we already know that a significant portion of those (literally millions) are lost or permanently inactive.

This is a broad generalization without support. I work in a field that is highly dependent on local weather conditions. I can tell you that forecasts are sometimes right, but I would not say they work “quite well”. It’s important to relate the scale or perspective.  
For example, a forecast for weather hours away has a much higher rate of accuracy. But even 3 days off it can easily change quite dramatically. We have incredibly advanced satellites, ground radar systems, and massive amounts of computing power devoted (at times) to forecasting weather and it’s still only mildly accurate.  
Just take a look at the so-called “accuracy“ of a hurricane’s projected path. Sure, it’s within a few degrees over the next several hours, but the further you attempt to predict into the future the less accurate your prediction becomes.  
All this relates back to entropy, and that’s from the microscopic to macroscopic scale.  
I’d argue that forecasting the price movement of bitcoin is just as impossible.  
You can’t unbeat an egg.

Or maybe they aren’t particularly seeking it *yet* and they are anticipating a future demand, therefore positioning themselves as first-in-market. This is good business development. And you’re right, examining the players is important. (Golden rule and all that.). 
Your post is on point, because I don’t think many readers here really *get* the concept of how institutional buyers operate. There isn’t just some guy in the office running 100BTC buys on the Robinhood app on behalf of the company.  LOL I’m picturing everyone gathering around some guy’s desk in Jordan Belfort’s office cheering him on as he swipes up to sell 1k BTC on RH for a tidy profit last night. Then they pop champagne bottles and bang hookers.  
Let’s see, 10am, they are all stumbling around now waiting for their coke guy to show up with a delivery.
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:14:34
Kind of. But the “limit” is the min/max limit you are willing to sell/buy at and you can determine the amount and price where you’d like to transact. You can use this to target (with a good dose of hopium and luck) a buy on a dip or a sell on a jump. Let’s say BTC is at $10,000 and you think “I might buy another 0.10 at 9,000. But I’d definitely buy 0.10 if it dipped to 8,000.” So set a limit buy at $8,000 max for 0.10 ($800).  This will temporarily tie up $800 that’s sitting in your account, but if you chose at any time to do something else with that $800 you just cancel the buy order.  
And if while you’re sleeping there is a sudden dip to 8000, it can trigger your limit buy, and you’ve just BTFD while you slept. A few hours later you wake up, happy to see your buy triggered and in the few hours since it’s happened, it’s already back to $10k.  &lt;— These are 100% made up numbers.  The same thing can be done with a sell limit order, where you say “I’m in at $10k, but I’d want to sell at $12k” just set a sell limit order and it will get done if the price jumps while you’re away and there is a buyer (aka “Taker”) for your order. (You are considered the order “Maker”, hence the terms Maker/Taker).  
The point is, BTC doesn’t move when it’s convenient for most of us. We (hopefully) are living our lives away from the BTC exchange screen. Using a well-calculated limit buy or limit sell order, you can have your account make a move when you’re away.  
BE CAREFUL, as always, this isn’t professional financial advice. I’m just some dumbass on the internet that likes to follow crypto.  All the numbers are made up, and you will either end up broke or rich or somewhere in between if you play games with money.

I think that as adoption becomes more widespread, the ”price” will stabilize. However, at the same time, I think there is likely to be a hyperinflation of fiat currency, such that the “price” will still not be ”stable” because whatever currency you want to value BTC in will not be stable. There is a critical point where the relative value is less important in terms of fiat currency, and it becomes more about the value of goods and services denoted in Bitcoin directly.

Simple explanation:  Mining (maintaining the ledger) is competitive and incentive based. The miners usually go after the highest fees first, because it's more profitable. The bitcoin sender sets their fee and can opt for lower cost / longer confirmation time or higher cost / faster confirmation time. Confirmation time is essentially "transaction time" and you pay a premium for the best (fastest) results.  
From a bitcoin sender's point of view, if I need a fast confirmation, I'll pay that premium. Maybe I'm buying goods in person and don't want to wait around 30 minutes if the mining pool is thick.  Or if I'm just sending from my own wallet to another of my own wallets, I don't mind the confirmation taking all day as long as it confirms, so I'll set a lower rate. I know I'm good for it. ;)

That’s horrible, but yes, there is often some extreme variation in RH’s “market” price, and I think it gets more extreme during heavy swings, which includes today obviously.  
I was just responding to another Redditor moments ago about this very issue. I actually had it work to my advantage a couple days ago and was able to pull a market sell on RH at several percent over what the market showed pretty much everywhere else.  
I have a love/hate relationship with RH. I would feel 10x better if they’d let me move coins in/out. And I’d really like to see order book data and more info like on other exchanges. Just more transparency, really.

I might be a moron, but I think you may have mixed up the more than / less than in your first sentence.  Throwing around $1k in BTC on Robinhood is not that big of deal. But you wouldn’t find me holding $20k in BTC there. The fact that you think “they would have to go bankrupt and lose everyone’s money“ is the only way your RH held BTC might disappear indicates that you aren’t very educated on the dynamics of crypto. Likewise thinking you’ve “saved probably $500 on fees from Robinhood” tells me that you may in fact be the moron in the room. Good luck getting a limit order to trigger on RH while the market price sails right past your limit mark and you’re wondering why it never executed. They may not show a transaction “fee” but they are getting their money on your buy and sell orders whether they are market or limit orders by the way they execute them. They are pulling a margin on that transaction no matter what.  
“Not your keys not your coin” is not a meme, it’s a very important rule to understanding Bitcoin and what it means beyond your gambling world of “trading” BTC on Robinhood.  Ooh, so you‘ve ”saved $500” swinging $1000 in BTC back and forth on 20 trades. You’re a big boy crypto whale now.  
Don’t come crying to me when some insider in the RH office decides to run off with a usb drive and all your BTC they’ve stolen from RH. Or when the DOJ shows up at RH and starts toting away servers and drives because they pull a warrant for whatever bullshit they want because someone has an ax to grind with crypto. Or maybe it’s a typical day at RH and your account is flagged, you’re unable to withdraw your money until you re-verify your identity but turns out they don’t like the way your drivers license looks.

I dont deny that bitcoin is used for illegal activity. But so are US Dollars. The biggest difference is that the path of bitcoin is traceable. USD are arguably much more difficult to track.
Are Robinhood as concerned about USD being used for transactions RH Crypto if those dollars might have a tainted history?
I think there is waaaaay more to it than RH is letting on. I think it has a lot to do with how RH manages crypto purchases, market and limit orders and how they are skimming a whole lot on these transactions. Why? Because they can. It’s unregulated. Who’s to say they aren’t selling me the same exact satoshi that they sell you? For them it’s just a jar of random satoshis and they are temporarily assigning ownership of a specified amount to me in exchange for USD.
If they are so concerned about the source of crypto moving IN to accounts, what have they done to guarantee the “cleanliness” of those they have brought into their exchange that they are selling me? Are we to believe they are running a market with liquidity provided only through virgin BTC (and virgin shitcoins)?  I seriously doubt it.
No more RH crypto purchases from me. They are trying to control bitcoin in a way that they really, ultimately can’t. I’ll buy my BTC somewhere else, thank you very much.

For real there is a time you will need to let this go. That’s a lot of weight to carry.
I once closed a stock position for a nice 5 figure sum and many x ROI. It helped me buy a place to live, which I later turned for a modest profit. Took some of that and started a business which is wonderful and ‘sometimes’ profitable.  Looking back, had I just kept that stock position open, that 5 figure profit would now be a 30m profit.
It hung on me for a long time until I started to understand, it was still a good decision at the time, and the best decision based on the data at hand. That 5 figure win did truly change my life in a positive way.  And (most) of the past decade has been wonderful because of it.
Would I rather have the 30m? Fuck yeah. No, wait, I didn’t totally mean that. I’m over it, really. Ok maybe we both need therapy. ;)
@_date: 2019-10-26 03:40:27
No sweat, I can dig it!   I thought we were all supposed to buy high and sell low, but I’m still getting it all figured out, lol.  
Please do be cautious with RH. I use them myself but only for some small change stuff because it is convenient and fast. But there are definitely some issues with how they transact limit orders. Market orders are typically instant and do go with their current “market” price but I often see variation between RH price and elsewhere.  This can be used to your advantage (arbitrage) if you time it right.  I was able to sell some shitcoin on RH the other day at several percent higher than it was on Coinbase Pro (and elsewhere).

Here’s the problem:  you absolutely must get the company that sent the coins involved. Otherwise you are banging your head against the wall. Just because you claim (to Coinbase) that these 2 BTC were incorrectly sent to them and should have gone to you doesn’t mean it’s true. Now everyone who has seen this post and address could go to Coinbase saying the same thing. Only the sender can verify and confirm.  
The only way to prove the first transaction is to repeat it, with a send from the same sending address.  
I saw something in one of your replies that made me think there could even be a fourth party involved? Did the sending party send directly from a wallet that they control, or did they use another party to “purchase/send” the BTC? If that’s the case, you will need the cooperation of that fourth party as well.   
Ultimately, Coinbase will have to (1) verify the send was thru your involved parties AND (2) rule out that it wasn’t a legit transaction for anyone else, before returning you the 2 BTC. (Charging you an appropriate few for the research and correction is also reasonable, I think.)

Reminds me of some days in 2017 for sure. Except I’m a lot less emotional about it. Up or down. There is something to be said for gaining a certain emotional immunity to Bitcoin volatility.

I’m certain that Bitcoin has been to the moon many times over. Man? I really don’t know, don’t care, but don’t necessarily doubt it.  
And I’m certain that Bitcoin will return, and hopefully Man as well.

Bitcoin exists in a warped version of time, a 5th dimensional cross-section of a 4 dimensional shape. 2 weeks in Bitcoin Time is like 2 years or 2 minutes in Matrix Time. You’re going to need to multiply by a Fibonacci based equation and solve for ***t***. Of course I might have made this all up, or perhaps I’m sleeping with the Bitcoin Time Traveler.

I’m pissed at myself for having bought BTC on Robinhood. When I first tried it out, they said something like “we haven’t enabled moving cryptocurrency to your own wallet \*\*\*yet\*\*\*” and I actually thought they intended to do so. Haven’t seen any mention of it since.  
To be fair, I just checked on their site, and they say:  “At this time we don’t support coin withdrawals, though we plan to do so in the future.“. 
Source:  [  
Don’t hold your breath.  
They go on to say, “our primary concern is preventing the proceeds from illegal activity from being used for transactions on Robinhood Crypto,” which to me is total bullshit.

I’d say we’re not really ‘arguing’ as much as exploring an idea. I got to thinking about it this way:  What if I bought then sold some stock on RH (which I have done) and then withdrew $100 from that sale into my bank account. At this point I have $100 disbursed from RH, and who is to say what the history of that $100 is? Did they send me a dollar that they received from someone else’s deposit that might have been gained through nefarious means?  
It likely doesn’t matter where that dollar came from, because it’s my dollar now. I guess I don’t see how/why RH should be treating 100 satoshis any differently.  I know that the USD (or BTC) that I might deposit into RH are legally obtained and therefore a legitimate input transaction aka deposit. When I go to withdraw USD (or BTC) from RH, then I know that is also a legal And legitimate output transaction aka withdrawal. RH assumes as much by participating in the transaction and has reasonable belief because I’ve completed the KYC process. USD/BTC/Shitcoin same-same.  
So back to my original point... it just pisses me off that RH is using the “excuse” about BTC/cryptocurrencies being used for illegal purposes as the “reason” they are not allowing deposits and withdrawals of those coins. This excuse is BS.  
I really hope for their sake, and for Bitcoin’s sake, they eventually do provide crypto portability, because that is good for bitcoin. Ultimately bitcoin doesn’t care, and I do think it’s great that RH is exposing a large population of new users to Bitcoin, and even their half-assed approach is better than nothing. But the non-portability definitely changes the reality of it, because otherwise they are treating crypto solely as an investment vehicle relative to fiat, and missing the ultimate point of it all. I mean, they actually list BSV and Doge, so I guess maybe I should’nt have such high hopes for a bunch of shitcoiners.  
I do appreciate the discourse, and I think we’re mostly on the same page. Hopefully there are some other readers out there that take this into consideration and choose to follow the best rule: Not your keys, not your coin. And I just appreciate an opportunity to call out Robinhood Crypto for their bullshit. I’m otherwise a big fan of Robinhood and think they’ve done a lot to bring investment and saving, and now cryptocurrency, to a new audience that were previously insulated from such things. Your average joe didn’t just roll into Merrill Lynch and say “yo set me up with a brokerage account so I can buy a single share of Netflix, a bag of Cannabistocks and an ounce of shitcoins.” So there’s that.

I smiled.  
Then I wondered how much it actually costs to print a dollar bill.  
So I looked here:  [  
...then threw up in my mouth a little bit.  It turns out it costs about 5.5 cents to print a $1 bill, and it goes up over 11 cents for larger denominations, with the $100 bill costing the most at 14.2 cents. I didn’t realize there was such a lousy mining profitability ratio on Fiat Shitcoin USD!
I thought I had a firm grasp on the ridiculousness of the deflationary dollar, but this really takes it up a notch.

You may have misunderstood. I think we probably agree that for the most part shitcoins are shitcoins. I’m just curious why so many are rising in tandem with BTC during this rally. I feel like typically the capital moves towards BTC and out of alts, and as BTC rises the alts either hold or drop. Just curious what the forces that are moving the market this week really are all about.
@_date: 2019-10-27 14:38:20

Arbitrage tends to render these things into an equilibrium of sorts at least in markets with sufficient liquidity under “normal” circumstances. It’s the same for the BTC-AltCoin pairs. If you compare BTC-ALT values at a point in time the BTC-USD and ALT-USD pairs all seem balanced.  Now the moments that this *isnt* true, you could stand to see a profit of handed correctly. This takes automated (bot) trading to create a significant result and the gaps quickly close.

This needs to be said, maybe not for you but for a lot of people checking in here today:  Past performance does not guarantee future results.  
HOWEVER, if 2017 is any indication, this kind of jump, especially when it’s across the board including Bitcoin and almost every shitcoin in the Top 100, ends up triggering massive FOMO. This could kick off a shitstorm of FOMO tomorrow.  
There is nobody, and I mean absolutely nobody who knows if we’ll wake up to $10k, $1k or $100k tomorrow. I am mostly certain it will be between $1k and $100k. Mostly.  YMMV

The SEC? As far as US tax law, I think it’s the IRS that matters. Can you please show me where the IRS says that wash sale applies to “virtual currency” (their term for crypto currency including Bitcoin)?  
For real, I’m trying to find a decisive answer on this. Not challenging you on it to be a prick, just trying to find out the truth...if there is one. The fact that things like this aren’t easily understood means the system is not working properly.
