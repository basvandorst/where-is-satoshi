550 of 150k+ seems a pretty small portion.
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:19:04
Wow, for a second you actually managed to make me doubt my complete trust and eagerness to be part of a global government.
Well done.
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:51:30
Thanks for helping making the BTC network safer.
But I do wonder why you gave up 80k$ worth of bitcoins...
@_date: 2014-03-28 03:13:25


Which is perfectly correct, since BTC is a deflationary currency.
@_date: 2014-07-25 13:59:39
Right, Sager. Haven't heard of that name in a while. You can find the components on ebay. GPU are generally based around the MXM interface.
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:35:11
I'm sure Apple will find a way to block it.
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:18:16
I don't think many people are using the same passwords for crypto stuff. I did one huge mistake at the beginning, and that was using the same email on all pools and exchanges, but passwords were always different (god bless lastpass).
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:00:30
Holy crap, that's huge.
Awesome news!
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:42:10
Same, mining altcoins, and any BTC I get I reinvest in Doge which is now very cheap.
@_date: 2014-01-18 19:16:52
They wouldn't be taking bitcoins, they'd be using a service like coinbase that instantly transforms the bitcoins in usd.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:09:28
It's a rollercoaster, it goes up and it goes down, and then back up. :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:59:21
It's a risky investment.
But to be fair the whole cryptocurrency market is a high risk investment.
@_date: 2014-05-24 13:49:16
But why don't they just stay out of the western countries, so they don't have to waste their time with those regulations? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:08:53
Problem is doge is currently using scrypt, which already has ASICs, and will have even better ASICs as time comes.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:17:54
Yeah, even blackcoin, which has the stability of the blackcoinpool...
@_date: 2014-05-14 11:41:20
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:22:40
People use them because they have the highest BTC/Fiat ratio, and people love to get "more bang for the buck", despite the fact that the buck never actually arrives.
@_date: 2014-03-22 02:55:14
The difference is that the government can use force to get you to fork over the cash, but if you have destroyed all copies of the private key and memorized it NOTHING (legal) can get that money back.
Ofc the criminals he has fucked over don't care about legality and could use torture and other unorthodox methods to get hold of the private key, but that's another matter entirely.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:10:44
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:37:36
For now.
@_date: 2014-04-08 22:15:58
They login through the API.
@_date: 2014-07-25 11:06:22
I don't have any information on the Lenovo Y-series, but the Asus ROG series have the components (GPU, specifically) soldered to the motherboard, which makes it impossible to upgrade and a pain in the ass to replace if it breaks.
The only real competitor for Alienware Gaming Laptops is Santech, but Santech doesn't offer the Worldwide next day on site warranty Dell provides, and if you're buying a gaming laptop it means you have the money and you need it to have the performance available while you travel for work, and having a technician come to your hotel to fix your laptop wherever you are in the world within 24 hours is easily worth the $500 more.
@_date: 2014-03-01 22:25:16
Other coins have halving rates, but none reached "can't mine anymore" point, so people can always get in and mine a little more.
PoS, on the other side, makes it so that people can get in only by buying, after it's applied.
I don't think Tx Fees are enough for people to keep mining.
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:22:37
Artificial intelligence. Incorruptible.
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:09:16
Wow, it's already worth so much? Cool, thanks.
@_date: 2014-01-31 20:11:47
I think the purpose in this case is getting a precedent made in the legal system, so future judges have something to base their future judging on.
@_date: 2014-05-01 22:31:35
No Tomb Raider GOTY. :(
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:20:05
Yes. Kids are naive because of lack of knowledge, but they are in no way stupid.
And they have the advantage of being able to learn EXTREMELY fast.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:17:43
Welcome to an unregulated market.
@_date: 2014-06-10 11:05:02
I guess those policemen are now without a job.
@_date: 2014-01-27 19:00:18
Whoa, you're right, price is dropping fast!
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:19:38
@_date: 2014-05-12 07:22:36
Someone should suggest them to use bitcoins or dogecoins
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:27:50
@_date: 2014-07-31 00:23:21
Took them long enough...
@_date: 2014-03-05 13:35:39
I'm not daytrading, I just bought at 160 and now waiting for price to go up above 200 to sell.
@_date: 2014-07-20 12:27:34
Me a XPS 12!
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:25:34
Without the biggest advantage either (physical possession).
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:45:53
Doge is Scrypt, which is already overrun by asics.
@_date: 2014-01-20 14:26:03
Quantum computing is still far away, though, so hopefully that will be fixed before it becomes an issue.
@_date: 2014-10-03 18:56:13
He will just disappear, then.
@_date: 2014-08-07 12:12:51
I did the opposite. My buy orders at 50sat and 35sat have been completed.
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:51:27
Or a paper wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:40:16
Desktop computers yes, laptops not so much, Dell's worldwide next day on site warranty is extremely useful.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:41:21
I don't understand: what's the issue with treating Bitcoin as a currency?
@_date: 2014-03-01 21:55:22
And network needs miners for confirmations, how are you gonna solve that?
@_date: 2014-07-25 10:40:49
Desktop yes, laptop no.
@_date: 2014-03-01 14:27:30
And this is why ASICs shouldn't be usable in crypto. No such scams can be done with GPUs.
@_date: 2014-05-02 09:37:33
Wow, awesome! Thanks, gonna buy it later. Steam prices in Europe are a scam.
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:07:38
You're telling me that if you could have stolen more than you make in 3 years of work without consequences you wouldn't have done it and considered it a payment for finding and reporting the issue?
@_date: 2014-03-06 11:48:31
Well, she does have a constant stream of high quality stuff, afterall.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:08:03
And Vertcoin, definitely Vertcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:17:15
Yes you can stop them, by moving on to other algos which are harder to make an ASIC for. THIS is a perfect example of why ASIC is EXTREMELY unfair, this is the perfect example of why we have to move on from algos which have succumbed to ASICs and on to newer untouched algos, like X11.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:34:48


This actually bothers me: why isn't BTC adding Dark Gravity Wave or DigiShield support? Is not that big of a change and would help solving this issue completely.
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:29:48
But, if they started selling tenths of thousands of bitcoins on other exchanges, wouldn't that make the bitcoins value crash brutally?
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:53:41
Hot yes, women only not. I often see plenty of (hot) male tellers.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:21:39
Let's hope it crashes under $100 again. I need some dinero. :(
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:22:34
We'd be ready if buying it wasn't a fucking pain in the ass.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:33:40
Well, I have never used online exchanges, since banks normally automatically change between currencies, and physical exchanges never gave me problems for amounts so yeah...
Give what to charity?
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:11:48
Problem solved. A pleasure doing business with Loggan08.
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:35:58
I wasn't stating that you can't, just that the sellers follow the rate that's the most profitable for them...
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:46:47
Guess you saw this image: 
@_date: 2013-08-19 18:03:00
I guess european sellers didn't get the memo, because prices increased by over 8% overnight.
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:05:09
Just make sure you don't lose half of your asset because of the huge fluctuations in value bitcoin has...
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:55:22
Or, simplier, credit/debit cards...
@_date: 2013-08-23 22:52:49
To be fair, we're giving that freedom to those people so they can protect us from ... ourselves...
The reason most of those checks are in place are to avoid you being scammed or robbed of all your money...
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:41:28
Wow, 50BC. That's a lot of money...
IMHO the best choice would be separate the money on various online wallets, and on your PC/phone. Diversify pretty much, so if one goes down you still have all the others.
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:57:34
The thing that annoys me the most about banks is that they can block your money at ANY time, for ANY reason, and upon police request they can block it for years at a time without issues. That's absolutely unacceptable.
@_date: 2013-08-25 14:37:22
Again, depending on the definition, NOTHING except food, water, air and sex is necessary for a productive life...
CC is just a tool which, like many other tools we use every day of our life, makes our life easier.
@_date: 2013-08-14 14:43:55
Except you have a very high price, and don't support paypal/credit card, so it doesn't really count as "easy buy"...
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:22:26
I'm pretty sure they can find a solution. The guy that made the bitcoin sale site on paypal said that despite the chargebacks the service was a success...
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:12:34
Damn, I wish Western Union started selling bitcoins, dammit. I have one of their offices like 5 minutes away...
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:21:38
I am not in the US...
@_date: 2013-08-22 18:39:53
You do realize that no chargebacks penalizes the customer though, right?
@_date: 2013-12-05 00:33:53
Yeah, when when? I would have bought before asap.
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:21:29
I am not in the US...
@_date: 2013-08-19 12:17:35
Also, sellers on localbitcoins are following gox's rate, so it's kinda hard to ignore it...
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:47:04
Congrats for the balls, man. I'm curious to see how your experiment pans out. Keep us posted!
@_date: 2013-08-23 21:54:55
To be fair, you can do that with a credit/debit card...
@_date: 2013-08-19 11:59:42
Except localbitcoin sellers follow gox's prices...
@_date: 2013-08-26 17:13:16
Same thing.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:16:06
Pisses me off that I didn't buy it when it was at 70$.
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:03:50
Except coinbase can fail at any time, while banks cannot fail by law(if they bankrupt, they either get bought by other banks, or the government takes over, so the money is never lost).
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:52:15
Yeah, same. I had the opportunity to put up a mining rig at that time, but passed it, because it felt too much work.
Banging my head on the wall now...
@_date: 2013-08-14 23:19:47
It's annoying. I hope there is a BC crash soon, so I can stock up on bitcoins cheap, for later use on the silkroad.
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:14:21
Depends on what you consider a productive life. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:33:23
Apparently he was right. Bitcoins back above $1k. I was waiting for them to drop under $500 to buy, but I guess that ain't gonna happen ever again now.
@_date: 2013-08-23 23:59:49
And get DEA pay you a visit the morning after?
@_date: 2013-12-10 23:47:00


Leaving aside the fact that bank transfer takes days to process, THE EXCHANGES NOW STARTED ASKING FOR VERY PERSONAL DATA!
I can't use bitstamp anymore because they want me to send them a scan of my passport and a proof of residence, which is something absurd to send to an internet company that has no business knowing that stuff.
@_date: 2013-08-26 15:40:38
Except it does.
Online buying: as long as you have money on the bank account you can buy anything within seconds, and have it delivered to your doorstep the morning after. You can't do this with any other payment system (except bitcoins, BUT you first have to acquire bitcoins, which means waiting x days for your bank transfer to go through on bitstamp/other exchanges).
Offline buying: insert card, insert pin, walk away with the product. No need to count coins, no need to count money, NO NEED TO BRING CASH ON YOU (which can be stolen), no need to bring expensive tools with you (bitcoins -&gt; smartphone). A simple 0.10$ plastic card that if stolen can't be used, and if stolen can be blocked and replaced with a simple phone call.
Say what you want but in concept a CC is nearly the perfect payment tool.
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:32:36
That's the problem. Generally we would just use paypal, but I guess you don't wanna do that, even if it's only 4$ right?
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:24:08
And back.
@_date: 2013-08-23 20:22:59
They are fun. IMHO worth watching just for the fun.
@_date: 2013-08-24 00:09:05
Can't you just get a debit card that can never go under 0?
@_date: 2013-12-07 14:52:44
Hope it falls $290 more, so I can buy.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:51:19
Wait a few more days. I put myself a 300€/btc as target. Once it gets to that or under that I buy.
@_date: 2013-08-22 22:46:26
Write the goddamn thing down...
Regarding chances of things going wrong, if they do you only lose a small part of your money, where if you left your dinero on mtgox and mtgox went down you'd lose the whole block of $6k...
