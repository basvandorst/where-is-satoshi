price &lt; 7000
=&gt; less miners
=&gt; less hash power
=&gt; less blocks found
=&gt; less miner rewards
=&gt; less selling pressure from miners
=&gt; price decrease stops
= self-regulating pricing system

The traditional financial world will find it very hard to accept that cash flow is no longer a factor. But that's the way it is. Communities will add value for their own benefit.

Nice list, thank you very much.
All of them have been just copy cats. Next 5y might look different.

The Chinese are usually very smart and big strategists. But fortunately they have made a big mistake: they banned Bitcoin. With that they have lost their influence and control. We do not have to worry until they embrace Bitcoin again. Until then, every attempt and measure is doomed to fail.

Passionate collector. Should be a lot more lucrative than stamps. Hope he has all the physical Bitcoins. :-)
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:46:15
You are saying 1 Bitcoin is going to 1 mln USD? ;-)

And at the very end it will be deflationary, as some priv keys get lost forever.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:48:15
It's more about the power of the community than price.
@_date: 2018-03-11 01:34:36
Yep, I am here.

You can say what you want about him. He is a good trader an has the right sniff. So, everything will be good.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:37:51
Me. :-) And you?

Crazy guy. Crashed the market, although more behind. And worst thing: I rather want a partial repayment in BTC than FIAT.

They are just talking about VAT. But it is good news anyway. With regard to capital gains, Bitcoin would also be handled much like foreign currency in Germany. For sales within one year period, the personal income tax rate will apply. After one year, any profits are tax-free.
Disclaimer: But I am not a tax lawyer. So, please do not rely on my answer.

Great list. Thx.

If I were the president of a nation, I would buy the rest of the BTC and show them as currency reserve in the next central bank report. It would cause a stampede and every other nation would panic. My country would become the world's leading nation within a decade. But relax guys. Now that the box of Pandorra is open it will happen. Sooner or later. Just not sure who will start: a big corporation or a country.

I see many upcoming black swan events here.
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:15:07
Love it
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:21:21
Absolutely agree. Community will have to take responsibility. I vote for decentral democracy.
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:05:23
Did read it. ;-) And therefore talking about an "environment" for (potential) black swans. I can not imagine that everything that happened so far is normal. :-) And Mr. Taleb's strategy was to bet a small portion on extreme events. Unpredictable. But if they happen, then lead to an above-average return. No need to discuss now. We will be part of it. In one way or another.

A different 1 percent of households own nearly 90 percent of all Bitcoins. ;-)
@_date: 2018-03-23 16:52:25
Even 100 percent every 7 **years** would be decent, and could be possible due to the deflationary nature of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:14:22
These are the posts we need to see now. Thumbs up.
@_date: 2018-03-22 15:09:16
There will be. Just do not know which.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:47:56
Ps. Maybe no empire. But a new (decentral) system in many ways. Not limited by old state borders. Just didn't find a better new word for it.
@_date: 2018-02-27 19:58:42
Yep, German BMF confirmed exchange of Bitcoin is exempt from VAT as long as used as money. But this does not apply to virtual play money (so-called game currencies or in-game currencies, especially in online games)...which could apply to some other coin cases.
@_date: 2018-07-03 23:46:59
Nice comparison
@_date: 2018-07-16 13:50:54
Wow. Extremely cool. Many thanks for sharing. Kindest regards, Juergen
@_date: 2018-04-15 11:45:38
Just love this chart.

You meant "Crypto **Worst** Correction"? ;-)

@_date: 2018-04-15 11:59:22
So, what is the price/value due to your theory? Bitcoin currently priced above or below its value?
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:45:21
Great idea
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:04:17
Always great.
@_date: 2018-04-23 08:41:38
I've never looked at it like that before. Could become true.
@_date: 2018-04-11 19:02:41
Too bad that this story was deleted. I really loved it.
