Could be, hard to know for anybody though because ordinary folk didn’t write the history books. I’ll do a little research and post again if I find anything regarding our questions

That’s a great point, off the top of my head it brings a question. If you were at the grocery store and want to pay your balance in gold would they even accept it? How would you pay $10.24 with gold. It would have to be some voucher or card system.  It’s not easily divisible physically is the only thing I can see if you were to insert gold into the fiat  system.  Not to say you couldn’t go back to standard golds coins so the value 10.24 doesn’t even exist or is not possible. After thinking while typing this, seems hard

I would tend to disagree with your statement. United States got rid of the gold standard mainly because of deflation and their inability to stimulate the economy. Yes fiat currency got us where the world is today, but should we be surprised?? To me it sounds like common sense. If I had Mr Fingersnack dollars that I controlled and printed well...”you get a loan, and you get a loan, and you get a loan” I know it’s not worth shit, and hopefully it will take you 80 odd years to find that out too. I believe that’s the point we’re in now. Just because where we are now is better then where we came from doesn’t mean that all those years ago the right choice was made.  Not here to argue with you just my opinion.

It’s a hard stance to argue. Things have only happened one way which got us here, and to argue a point which I say ‘if they never got rid of the gold standard we’d be better off’ I would be wrong. I don’t truly know and no one truly does.  Im just stating my opinion, there could of been a better solution all those years ago, as we are still trying to find one today (BTC).
