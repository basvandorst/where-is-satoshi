i am now realizing this was the wrong spot and i think i have been misunderstood or i am not really communicating well and i know NOW this should go to the noob bitcoin reddit.
anyways ill try and further dig myself deeper one more time.
i want the btc out of slushpool (so not FROM one address to another) and into my bitcoin core wallet (which is an address) but i just want to test my receive address first with a small payment (that im asking nobody for, im paying myself) but i had problems finding somewhere that i can buy small (like $5) amount of btc with ease and not using some unknown to me payment system (cant find a single one i can use paypal with)
i also found small bit of information on testing your address using sign/verify message in the bitcoin core client but it wasnt descriptive of his process and it diddnt work for me.
ill just keep asking elsewhere.....

since you are so smart can you tell me where i can buy under $5 bitcoin using paypal so i can do what i want?

its funny how people are thinking its suss,
i figured out how to mine for a few weeks back in 2011? or so (whenever the 6950 came out 6+ years ago) and diddnt think anything of it as .08 bitcoin wasnt really worth anything
its still at slushpool and i was gonna transfer to my wallet then convert to AU$ but im scared of fucking up and somehow losing that bitcoin/cash as im a bit broke at the moment

yeah you hit the nail on the head, i guess ill just take the plunge - only reason i wanted to test the process was to know what i was doing before making such a large (for me) transfer.

how the fuck else am i gonna test it?.
theres some sign/verify message thing i found about when googling but i couldnt get it to work

i dont have 1k in bitcoin i have around $1k worth in au dollars so like .08 btc (its actually .0771 or something)
i dont have the bitcoin in the wallet as i have been saying (i guess stupid cant read) its at slushpool and i have to withdraw all at once

mining "rig"? i dont have a specialized rig.
i just bought a graphics card and ran some program like 7 years ago and only now realized it might be worth something.
im not "investing" i was just playing with my card back in 2011 to see if mining bitcoins was worth it (it wasnt cause it was like $5 a bitcoin) and never thought anything of it until now.
anyways keep being a douche it seems like its your thing

i dont get why its bullshit? what the hell is the problem with asking for help?
how can i or anybody gain an advantage from helping me?
@_date: 2018-06-07 15:31:21
im googling my ass off and theres loads of places to do what i want but so far they all have a high min purchase amount which i kinda dont want to do right now and i cant find any other way to test my address - the search continues.....
