This sell off is still “slow” and “gradual” as far as crashes go. There was no $1000 drop in 10 mins or even 20 or 30 minutes. It’s a steady stream of losing $100-200 every few hours. The recovery will come when you see a colossal $1000-2000+ drop in the span of a few minutes. That’s what we had on Dec 22nd when the price went from $12k -&gt; $10k -&gt; $12k all within about 30 minutes.

If you kept 100% in USD, you could sleep at night. That’s the thing bitcoin is still not able to get to because of the volatility. You lose out due to inflation, but it’s safe. With bitcoin you don’t know what you’ll lose, and nobody sane sleeps well at night when 100% of their worth is in bitcoin.

You know, just reading your comment made me realise bitcoin has a LONG way to go before it becomes mainstream. It’s just too easy for a newcomer to make a wallet in the wrong way, get their money stolen, lost or just get frustrated and give up.
That said, there is big room for some company to sweep in and offer a trustworthy service. The irony is that it may be a big bank, but people would trust them to look after the bitcoin and be responsible for any stolen / lost coin.
I think until that happens, bitcoin will remain where it is in terms of % penetration / number of active users.

What did your technical analysis say in all of September, October, November, December? 
That analysis is no good at predicting medium scale trends. Maybe it can predict what’s going to happen in the next few candlesticks, and maybe it will predict what will happen “somewhere in the future” but you never know how soon or how far away.... and also if something else disruptive comes along in the middle then your analysis conclusion may not happen at all.

Internet in 2005 was pretty mainstream and more or less in everyone’s home, here to stay, and nobody could imagine going back to living without it. Bitcoin is nowhere near that stage yet. It’s not even where the internet was in 1999!
The internet in 2000-2001 was already something people paid for in Internet cafes everywhere, my local Starbucks already had computers with free timed internet, teachers at school educating us about how to use search engines (even though they wrongly said to compare results with Yahoo and AskJeeves and whatever), and MySpace started becoming a thing.
With bitcoin? We just have a bunch of people still arguing whether it’s a bubble or deserves to exist or will it still be around in 5 years. That was definitely not the case with the internet.
There’s a reason why we have so much uncertainty - because there is genuine cause for concern. The cash requirement to keep bitcoin’s market cap where it is is actually significant, and as is evident from the price... most of the market wants to hang back and see what happens. The total capital invested in bitcoin has been gradually dropping.
Other cryptos are going up and that’s a great sign, crypto is here to stay. Bitcoin specifically - nobody knows.

Those same fellows who sold at 19,000-16,000 sold most recently at 12,000-13,000 last week. Why would they buy at 10,000? This is probably going down to 8000 when they’ll buy back up to 11,000 or so. No one wants to be the bagholder, and the current trend is lower peaks, so each new selloff is expected to happen at a lower level, and the whales are selling at these lower levels.

Why would you be skeptical? I’m surprised it isn’t higher to be frank. Japan is supposed to be trading 50% of global volume of bitcoins. 3.7m is way lower than half of all bitcoins. Which means they have less but use them a lot more frequently. They’re not the typical hodler profile we have here.

That's for you, and lightning will definitely do great things reducing load from users like yourself who make multiple transactions a day (today) using bitcoin. But you have to remember that there are only a few hundred K transactions per day today.
When you want to bring bitcoin to the masses and process millions of users' transactions a day, 1 per person is still many times more than the total today. Thus LN is not going to solve that fee problem if everyone still needs to have 1 layer on chain. Something else is needed.

This argument is so full of shit though. Yes the value of A SINGLE USD has gone down a lot since inception but that didn’t affect the strength of the currency. The overall “market cap” for lack of better way of putting it is UP for the USD, in terms of what utility you can buy. 100 years ago you couldn’t buy entire sovereign nations with all the value of USD in the world, but now you can. More USD were introduced into the system, but the drop in value was far less than would occur from pure dilution. So actually, the value of the dollar has gone UP.

The regulated exchanges have triggers as follows for all things they trade:
- 5% change results in stop of 2 mins
- 10% change results in stop of 5 mins
- 20% change results in stop for the day.
Some variances depending on the exchange, but for certain those big drops result in stopping altogether for a cool down.
Remember this is change on the futures price, not the BTC price... but they should be very closely correlated anyway, and BTC has 10% price swings daily.

Just wait for the actual crypto bubble to pop, probably 2018 or definitely by 2019. At that point only the strongest currencies will survive. Even whales will leave. It will still be another 2-3 years thereafter that BTC + whichever other currencies survive for good. Just like with that dotcom bubble eliminating all the trash companies.

Most big exchanges have an over the counter department if you talk to the Customer Service. At least my local one here in Hong Kong does. They say OTC don't put the order in the exchange. Also don't consider OTC if your BTC amount is below 50BTC. FYI the daily volumes on the exchange are only around 300-500 BTC, so it would be like someone wanting to sell 1000-2000BTC in the US.

This is people in control of their wallets. Judging by other figures like users on various exchanges, it would appear that majority of bitcoin owners DO NOT have their own wallets / addresses. They're all stored on the exchange itself and never withdrawn. The exchange itself does not create one wallet per user. That's way too expensive and also unnecessary.
It would be very wrong to say the user base consists only of the ones leading the pack that have their own address.

A lot more needs to happen for Bitcoin to be the new ruler of the world economy. The infrastructure just isn't there yet. All ATMs, all NFC payment systems, all vending machines and the like (think ticket machines at train stations), all e-commerce websites, mom and pop shops, public transport systems in rural countries... everyone has to start accepting bitcoin, in order for it to be the ruler of the world economy.
We are only just reaching penetration for the INTERNET to be the new dominating force around the world. The same could not have been said 10 years ago before smartphones were popular, and the internet was in everyone's pockets. That's basically 10 years after the dotcom bubble and around 20 years after the internet became accessible.
We are nowhere near that stage yet with bitcoin. Adoption will take a long while longer. Don't fall a victim to seeing the market cap growing and imagining that the market is growing at the exact same rate. It isn't.

Not saying it’s your fault, but you could have guessed this. BTC fluctuates a minimum 3-4% on the CALM days, and the overall trend each week is UP. If there was ever a chance of delay to funds that could be sped up by paying 1-2% in fees, you pay those fees. Coinbase and other exchanges know this and that’s why the fees are so ridiculous. My “local” exchange had 0% fees for CASH deposit last year, those fees got bumped to 1% this year and increased again this week to 2.5%! For depositing cash!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:36:43

This is a patent to kill the bitcoin. Once they patent something, they can stop others from doing it (in this way).

Your bank's safety deposit box should be insured up to several hundred thousand USD. Go and ask them.
Buy a fat fireproof safe for yourself for $1000, but a bunch of coin there. Put the rest in your bank deposit box.
And if you really had so much that those several hundred thousand insured limit is too little, then stop complaining about the safe being too expensive to lug around. You should be used to that already.

In the last few months with just a few isolated days, you would have EARNED more money by paying those fees and buying instantly rather than wait for the funds to clear in 1-2 weeks. Bitcoin has risen about 0.7% every *day* on average. If it’s been 5 days for you you’ve already lost 0.5% by waiting. 
The exchanges know it, and that’s why the charge extortionate amounts. One of the bigger exchange here in South East Asia (ANX) started charging 2.5% on CASH deposits now because they know this math and people don’t want to wait to start buying.

You more or less NEED a bank account to use an exchange (otherwise you have ways of sending cash in but no cash out). Most exchanges like Gemini, GDAX will accept deposits by credit card.

You mean the same way you have sales tax and VAT? I’m surprised if they haven’t done it yet.

Sorry but how does lightning fix the problems? I thought the second layer still needs an IN and OUT = 2 transactions with the first layer? And isn’t the 2 transactions per wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:11:25
Pardon my ignorance if there’s something really wrong with my understanding.
But who will actually mine and let transactions go through? If there’s no miners, there’s also no transactions. The bitcoin becomes worthless! Or am I wrong?
People who spent thousands of $ on equipment to run at this high difficulty want a reward to make up for it. They will leave if it suddenly gets super cheap.
So who will mine? If blockchain themselves becomes the entire mining force, that’s then incredibly dangerous. Whoever mines does control the currency. Right?

Seeing as you are holding only $50, you better not. The cost of just buying / selling / withdrawing it will cost you more than any swing for the next whole year.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:37:46
Well maybe it is. This is the thing with being able to buy fractions. We see very different behaviour from if it is BRK.A at $100000 and nobody can play without serious money.

The transaction times are too slow. At least with the exchanges ive used they need a couple of hours minimum / up to 1-2 days to verify deposits.

If you want to join in the conspiracy thinking.... the media is biased to help the government agenda of keeping control. If crypto / fiat does replace Fiat, then the government power over its nation drops almost infinitely.
Be very wary, these attacks are just beginning. And it’s not all from bcash whatever people may want to think.

Yes, and the video was even taken down from liveleak. He had posted it in this sub 2 days after $10k was hit.

Someone needs to BUY it for you to be able to sell. I don’t think the whole world has enough buyers for $1.4B worth of bitcoins without shitting the price down, maybe permanently.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:40:55
And the practice, preparations, transport time, and expenses in all of them?? The guy would be lucky if he earns $10/hour off that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:24:35
You needn't believe everything you read.
The total value of all the bitcoin in the world is around $180B. That's barely a dent in anything. More money is invested in facebook, google, apple and a bunch of other big companies... EACH. 
You can bet your ass there are billions of people more terrified of Bitcoin vs people who are borrowing every last cent they can.

Buying bitcoin in Asia now costs 12k USD. It used to cost $11k yesterday and high $9k the day before that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:28:41
No, I can’t get verified in the US. I also don’t know what kind of taxes I need to pay in the US if I earn in the US. I also don’t want the hassle of transferring money internationally during the buy + sell. That takes too long and is added risk.
On the other hand, the percentage gains we get here are the same. So from an earnings point of view it doesn’t matter. It will matter later when the value stabilises and we want to buy things. But those should be price adjusted anyway, just like how a McDonald’s meal costs less here than in the US.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:10:53
Don’t you think some of that crazy valuation is going to come from the dollar DROPPING in value generally? I think we won’t want to hold dollars at all if BTC really becomes that valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:57:45
Yes. The thing is the strongest at the .com time survived all the way through. The shitty .coms died out. Bitcoin is far from being the shitty one in the group.

don't give them any ideas. In any case every single government would need to agree, or the vast majority, for this to work. Otherwise the one idiot government who did it then ends up missing the boat and fucking up his country while the rest of the world gets gains. Like what's happened with North Korea.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:48:26
I doubt it.
Because his gains per month historically far exceeded 7.5%. Your logic is sound for other investments though.
To rephrase: 1 month later his $20 would buy a lot less than "92.5% of the original bitcoins" he could have bought.

Don’t set a price to buy back, set a behaviour and don’t try to pinpoint. Here’s what I mean:
If the price is how it is now dropping steadily, and bouncing in these pathetic amounts ($500 over the course of an hour), don’t buy. It will keep dropping
Wait till you see either a big prolonged rise (eg. $1000+ sustained over the course of 2 weeks or even a month)
Wait till you see a flatline longer than 1-2 months
Or wait until you see a massive $2000-3000 spike in the span of an hour. 
Anything else is just a trap.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:08:04
That’s not the best way to think of it. Usually with these networks you need to build capacity first then let users fill it. It’s way way easier to get a user to come the first time compared to come a second time when his first experience sucked.

If bitcoin drops to $7K tomorrow, more people will lose confidence, and it starts getting the potential to drop to $6K.
At some point all confidence will be lost and $1 will be back... IF it continues this trend.
Right now nobody knows which way the trend is going to finish.
@_date: 2018-02-06 11:55:48
No, at this point $2k would be BEYOND pump and dump. The pump and dump is what you’re seeing now when we jumped $5900-&gt;$6500. It may have been fast and short, but that was over 10%. Just like the pump and dumps from $15-&gt;$17k.
A $2000 jump now is like if we went from $15k all the way back up to $20k. A $3000 spike is like $15k-&gt;$22k and a new ATH. Clear sign that the reversal is there to stay.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:57:44
Depends how you think about it.
If you buy AFTER (note nobody knows where the top is, just like we don’t know where the bottom is!) a $2-3k spike, you’re buying after we’re out of the woods in terms of the end of the crash.
The crash would be certainly over if bitcoin rises 50% again. And once the crash is over, the only way forward is up.
Maybe it will dip back down a bit in the short term, but it won’t be crashing anytime soon.
That’s my point.
@_date: 2018-02-21 04:11:15
If nobody bought or sold, the price wouldn’t change.

You have to also remember if all those initial “investors” never sold their bitcoin, it wouldn’t be where it is now. There must have been hundreds of guys like this one.

That’s even bigger volume than Dec 22, and we’re at less than half the price. That’s a lot of transactions.

Isn't that also cherry picking? Bitcoin started in 2009. So that's about 9 and a half years.
Out of that the MOST RECENT half year is in the red hugely. 
You kind of need to wait for the trend to change back to black before you can call it cherry picking a bubble.
