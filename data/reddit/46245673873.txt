it used to be "if bitcoin goes up, altcoins go up more" but it needed to become "if bitcoin goes up, new altcoins get invented, old altcoins get rekt" and it will become "if bitcoin goes up, it swallows everything".
that's because in the first place, altcoins were copying bitcoin, and trying to out-innovate it, then it turned out bitcoin can do something similar, like be inspired from say "privacy-coins" and now we have LN which essentially allows for anonymity afaict. (correct me if wrong).
so bitcoin giveth, bitcoin taketh.. ;)

usually people get inspired by stuff like this, after all humanity is some kind of collective consciousness anyway. I myself told people around me, many times in 2006, after being depressed by bush bombing iraq and getting elected for a fucking second time, that the only way to deal with the powers that be, is to give these people competition on the money market, I told everyone in forums and online that we are screwed unless they get real serious competition, then suddenly the liberty dollar emerged, and got raided, but the zeitgeist already shifted. bitcoin had to come, cause the zeitgeist had shifted. this is why some ppl think I am satoshi, but I am not, really! so just as a reminder for future revolutionary projects: change the zeitgeist, the goals, the attitudes towards thinking first, then actual change will force itself upon times. there will be no change ever, unless the way of thinking changes first. this is how you start and end empires btw, too.

it's not a hype if it does something useful, right? personally I like the idea that software can "evolve" similar to how biological systems may have evolved, learning by trial&amp;error and failing countless times until it discovers patterns and re-uses working "attempts" more frequently while constantly evaluating feedback. i.e. using feedback loops, or put more simply: learning autonomously.
@_date: 2019-07-15 08:47:41
don't follow this shady advice, follow this instead (logic)
ask yourself: will bitcoin die from this an go to 0?
yes - sell
no, set buy orders all the way down to how much you think it will go and profit from the reversal.
then ask yourself, has bitcoin died in the past?
look up chart, should answer your questisons.
then ask yourself, how low can it go?
look up charts, compare with past pullbacks, calculate percentages, set your buy order accordingly.
is any of this advice complete bs?
if bitcoin goes to 0 - yes
if bitcoin does not go do 0 - no.
can bitcoin go to $1000 and stay there forever?
is it likely?
can you get hit by an airplane on a train crossing?
is it likely?
so to conclude "buy the dip" is solid-ish advice, but only if you assume that bitcoin will not die from a dip, or die anytime in the next couple years. if you don't, don't buy the dip.
that being said, I, like many around here, 99.9995% are certain bitcoin won't go away. it will go up and down in price, but has a tendency to go up, fiat on the other hand is a failed business model, it can be created ad infinitum, which in itself forces something absolutely limited like bitcoin (limited supply) to go up nominally (in U$D price).

I might one day buy a $1000 phone with a small part of my bitcoin, but knowing full well an iPhone is a depreciating asset by nature, and a bitcoin is an appreciating asset until it becomes a static/stable asset, similar to gold. (saturation).

I think the answer is pretty straightforward: bitcoin is going to do microtransactions for dirt cheap, and this and other features will also make it a privacy coin. so altcoins have a hard time to compete. I like what the content creator coins are doing, but even their business model can and will be cannibalized by bitcoin in the long run.
this also goes along with what many early adopters thought of altcoins since their inception: a playground and testing-ground for tech to be later implemented in bitcoin.
this is not dissimilar to what apple is doing: watch what new tech is out, let it mature, then make a killer stable and secure application of it that is far better than anything out there and implement it into their products. spec wise, apple is mostly inferior to the competition, but the implementation is far superior usually. I see similar relations between bitcoin and altcoins.
@_date: 2019-07-04 20:21:00
look, I get the "banks" narrative, but bitcoin is not so much threatening banks, as it is threatening the big boys at the head of the pyramid, the money issuers, those who control the fed and the ecb in the west. if bitcoin is legit, then (smaller) banks will adopt bitcoin, and the big boys will be in serious trouble, as their main business model is being threatened by some code connected to a network issuing hard money.
why do I think there will be banks adopting bitcoin and still being successful with it? cause there are always people who are not sane enough to be able to control their own wealth, and if need be defend it. they like 3rd parties and they will give their private keys to a bank.
for everyone else, bitcoin means freedom and a way out of debt-slavery.
we'll see if it turns out this way, whether bitcoin was a sophisticated plot by the elites to introduce their world currency and make us buy into it, or whether they are so chill cause they essentially control the whole internet and currently are merely watching how people intend to use this. the itchy-word in the ladder case is "mass surveillance".
I try every day to figure out in which scenario we are currently in, I'd love to believe bitcoin is the real deal, but I can't afford not to be super sceptical about it every day. as we say in bitcoin, don't trust, verify...

I came across the currency/money definition some time ago, people were arguing that what people currently call "money" really is "currency" and money would be gold coins or something, similar to this:
"Such is the basic difference between money and currency. While money stores intrinsic value within itself, fiat currency possesses buying power bestowed upon it by the government"
what does this mean for bitcoin? is it money, or a crypto-currency? I guess neither, but it does not matter, it has features of money and of a currency, except for the part that governments give it value, instead the whole userbase gives it value and the amount of new users changing assets and other currencies to get some of the new money/currency at a certain rate.

@_date: 2019-08-20 15:29:16
satoshi just took this saying in a literal sense when inventing a method to make money using electrical power. infinitely better than the concept of people and/or authorities in charge of money issuance.
he probably knew that while money= power, power also corrupts, and absolute power corrupts absolutely, thus absolute power over money issuance, corrupts both, money issuance and its inherent power, absolutely.
of course this needed a fix.
thankfully it is super hard to centralise electrical power. as long as the wind is blowing and the sun is shining, there will be no monopoly on electricity and thus electrical power, and thus with bitcoin actual (political) power.
long story short, the power consumption of proof of work is essential for the disruptive capabilities of something like bitcoin. some think the power is wasted, but really someone just figured out that we can solve a lot of authority and monopolisation issues by finding a way to harness something as common as "energy" and use this energy as money.
of course it also takes energy or power to create fiat money, but it is in no way inherently linked to the value of the fiat tokens. with bitcoin it kind of is, among other things.
that being said, most of the power used for mining bitcoin is from renewable sources anyways, whatever that means, as even crude oil is renewable. energy is abundant on this planet, it is a myth that there is any shortage of it, all shortages are virtual and most of the climate hysteria was cautiously being launched as a population control mechanism.
there is no shortage in anything on this planet, except maybe intelligence, satoshi obviously knowing this, wisely causally linked money issuance with doing electrical work.
one could have linked it to anything, but it needed to be abundant &amp; accessible to everyone. energy is.

does it matter? one bitcoin is and was always one bitcoin, the second reason why the price keeps rising is bc some people actually use and spend it, the other reason being the central banks printing money out of thin air..

talk about anti-fragile, government trying to ban exchanges, people flee into bitcoin. I guess unless they try to politically centralize the whole world, including china, they are screwed. unless some three letter agency owns 1m BTC satoshi-stash...then we are pretty much screwed.

wait til their blaming turns inward ;) few realize that there is no such thing as investing in bitcoin, there merely is divesting from fiat or opting out of the legacy financial system. just make sure to diversify. digital assets are nice and all, but hard assets usually only get depreciated by bombs or corrupt government, humans have plenty of that..

pick your chances, during the rather rough sea of scaling debate, we have seen corrections of almost up to 50%, I remember 5k to 3k, 3k to 2k and so on, these were above the former ATH of 1.1k, so I would expect similar pullbacks if/when we pass 20k, I wonder if asian billionaires will fight the next round out to bring us to 50-300k..there were news of one fomoing in close to last ath and then losing his poo poo when it dumped ;)

@_date: 2019-08-24 15:23:41
the calculation he made is in the right ballpark though, if you take all values that are currently tagged (price-tag) by fiat denominations (usd, yuan, ruble, euro, yen, etc.) and start denominating them with bitcoin, as in everyone widely accepts it, and everyone anticipates it to have a purchasing reach of "infinite" or "everything on the market" then one bitcoin might as well have the current purchasing power of $10m, although at that point nobody would care about it being $10m anymore. I think this is what people call hyperbitcoinization, and it is not so far fetched. take all luxury goods combined for example, there are enough super yachts costing $10m, so should one out of 21m global tokens globally used be worth one super-yacht? sure, why not. I know, many care too much about the price already, and I get it, financial freedom whatnot...but, when it comes to price, I only wonder about whether the millionaires and billionaires of this world already widely bought into bitcoin or not. cause if not, and if/when they will, prices will again skyrocket..beyond $100k-ish easily.. now, many millionaires around me (I live in place with a good amount of socialism) they just inherited it, and are living the vanity life, you know, lots of iphones, ipads, flashy cars, vacations, and a ton of delusion, that kind of type. once these people get the idea that without at least owning one bitcoin, you're essentially a pleb, and just a "paper-millionaire" then you can expect lots of buy pressure. I just wonder if they have any, cause I don't know, and I can't just ask them, cause then they'd figure that I might have one, or some, or less(!)... :D

well, even gold has a bigger inflation potential than bitcoin, bitcoin is limited to earth and maybe moon though as the speed of light becomes an issue..
still, companies could start doing asteroid mining (for gold and other precious minerals/metals) so far gold and bitcoin, besides one place to live, are the best investments, just stay away from fiat, it will just do what it was designed for, rob ignorant people of their purchasing power.
by ignorant I mean that they are ok with being forced to use a valuation system of a foreign entity, some entity that hands out loans to their governments, instead of the other way round, essentially fiat money is cartel money.
there is a small chance that bitcoin was invented by this cartel too, but it is not very likely.
so, I guess bitcoin still **is** the way out, and everyone who does not "get it" will simply suffer from natural selection, which is a good thing. modern societies don't select for intelligence anymore, they should, or we all turn into mutants and zombies. as a species, genetic degeneracy is more dangerous than nuclear winters...
sry for digressing..

there is no shame in getting rich, the delicate detail regarding bitcoin though is:
if you do it right, banks get screwed, there will be sound money.
if you do it wrong, you’ll have total surveillance and people will literally eat your children.

intelligent persons act like this: if I don’t fully understand something, I take x amount and diversify it into y amount of options. if he had $2000 to invest in either bitcoin or gold, he should have invested $1000 in each. he would have 1000 bitcoin and about an ounce of gold now.

I doubt the banksters want you to use gold, google bretton woods.
as for the value of it, there is a metaphysical part to it. gold has been resembling the sun for many cultures, all ancient cultures understood how valuable the sun is. it is so valuable, that all religions can be traced back to basic sun worshipping.
also, gold being non corrosive, non reactive with common elements like oxygen, adds to the idea that this stuff is forever, eternal, maybe divine.
the question isn’t whether gold is valuable, but why anything else is valuable, given that it will just fade with time, decay, decompose or something.
bitcoin was modeled after gold for a good reason. since I think satoshi is a genius, he must have known about all facets of the meaning of gold, including the possibility in epigenetics, that due to its historic use, the value of gold might have been really written into our genes, our biology, as the spectral response of gold reflecting sunlight, is very particular, it could have constituted an evolutionary advantage to quickly being able to spot whether something is gold by its spectral response, I would surely love to see some experiments on this subject.
I think the biggest trick the banksters played on us, is, to lure us away from gold. first with paper, then with cards, then with numbers on an account running on their servers. ridiculous really. the reality is, nothing can compete with gold, and bitcoin can be seen as some groundbreaking invention, to elegantly refer and transduce the metaphysics and historic-ancient value of gold, to the digital domain.
some precursor experiments towards bitcoin were even called bit-gold :)

it isn’t. facebook-coin is a shitcoin by all known standards. it’s as much crypto as the company adding “crypto” to their registered company name, to see their stock doing 300% gains, it is designed to harvest buzzwords, it works with and for people who have no idea about what makes something like bitcoin valuable. too bad these people are the majority. best case: the smarter ones get curious about bitcoin instead of using facebook coin which could cause further buy pressure for the former. as others have put it, it will legitimize crypto as an idea further, might take 1-2 years before the fb-plebs find out about the real deal though.

anything beyond 1x on bitmex is degen, ah scratch that, betting is degen, and custodians holding your coin is extra degen. but if you came late to coinland and want to make a quick buck betting on the devaluation of usd, try going long on mex, but if you really want to push your luck, try shorting bitcoin to 0 lol.

not really mathematically secured. one attack vector is a social one. if enough people agree that the hard cap should be changed to say 30mil, it could be done. all it needs is a multi billion media campaign, and a false flag, similar to that happened around 911, so essentially bitcoin, as many systems, rely on people agreeing on certain things. see what happened during the blocksize debates...all systems eventually fail by people being either to stupid or not agreeing on basic properties of something, or both. thankfully bitcoin is far from any of this as most people involved are super intelligent, reasonable, bespoke, and very apt with logic, the whole space is, except for some lambomoons, but it also needs the lambomoons of course to some extent :)

yeah, we go to $9.2-$9.6k, then we retrace and make a few ppl panic while doing so, to $6k (july-august), then we moon more or less in the usual cascade of exponential bursts beyond $20k EOY. :) - 2020 should be crazy town and 2021 could see a big drop again making many ppl claim bitcoin was dead (again)..
I've pulled this out of a dark place, but we'll see if it holds true.
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:40:32
nah, we have been almost going straight up since 4k, no retrace at all, no fibonacci retraces either, if the bearmarket is really over, it needs to get confirmed by retracing about 40%, 6k would be a good price to buy in case it drops more.

just examine past bull-markets. there were corrections from 5k to 3k, from 3k to 2k, the current 9k to 8k is nothing, if anything the bull-trend and end of bear-market can and will only be confirmed if we go back to ~6k and go from there.

how about making a bitcoin puzzle out of your ads? like, do 150x ads in your city, add a QR code to each of them, and only if you combine all of them you will receive a code that leads you to a private key with 1BTC in it...if you like the idea, it costs 1BTC for my efforts ;)
@_date: 2019-05-31 01:41:41
did you buy the dip? ;) seriously though, the bear-market is over if we do one of the typical 30-40% corrections which we did during other historic bull-runs. 9000 to 8000 is nice but it is not enough to confirm we are out of the shackles.
