I would say that the bitcoin community vastly overestimates their intelligence, partly due to the us against the world mentality of a lot of bitcoiners that causes them to live inside of an echo chamber / circlejerk of other passionate bitcoiners.
If the average bitcoiner was savvier about tech security, privacy, and personal responsibility it wouldn't make sense why bitcoin scams, ponzi schemes, etc remain prevalent and successful to this day.  Scammers just want money and in the end they will always search for the easiest targets, bitcoin users continue be among them.
Yes, the fact that after the hack so many people would go back to trading on bitfinex boggles my mindhole.  A hack so suspicious in nature that many allege that it's an inside job.  It's at the same level as that really dumb guy who does so poorly on the exam that he alone is able to drag down the class average.
If you think Bitfinex was honest, anything short of a detailed explanation of what happened followed by how they patched the issue, means you are a fool that deserves to get fleeced if and when the next "hack" occurs.
Now that would be fine if you accept the risk knowingly, but I can already see people crying and screaming for regulations and rules again, searching to blame anyone but themselves, once the next hack occurs.

It's not like they secretly didn't use cold storage, they were pretty explicit about stating that multisig was safer than cold storage.  Blame Bitfinex or yourself for not doing due diligence.  Everybody in here is all about talking personal responsibility, but then when something happens it's a huge rush to blame someone, esp if the govt if possible.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:19:44
The first point is if Bitfinex was bragging that multisig was much safer than cold storage, they wouldnt have used cold storage even if they were allowed to, so it is irrelevant. 
The second point is if you were so dead certain that cold storage was the only safe method of keeping your coins, then why did you put your money with Bitfinex?  It wasn't like they lied about using cold storage.

If you're an investor in bitcoin and believe that is the case, put yourself in the 99% then for investing in something you think is too complex to be adopted.
Your assessment I would say is misguided and linked to this desire to think you're so much more clever than everyone.  Most people dont know how to program a vcr clock because they dont care to learn not because they lack the mental capacity to, they simply don't care enough to bother to learn.  Obviously if they wanted to they could.  People don't take computer security seriously because existing payment methods have a lot of safeguards to protect people from getting burned, when you're always in the water with floaties there isnt much incentive to learn to swim.
So I would think if you want to make a compelling reason why bitcoin adoption is slow, the reason would be people are too lazy to jump through the hoops to use bitcoin right now.  To be realistic there aren't many compelling reasons yet to use bitcoin over existing payment systems, in fact it's still unclear whether certain parts of bitcoin (blockchain) will even be a part of consumer payment channels.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:20:21
So then bitfinex lied to you... The point is you knew there was no cold storage, and you had a choice of whether to leave your money with the exchange.  I mean I don't want to rail on it because it sucks for everyone who may be incurring losses, but the moral of the story seems to always be the same for every single hack in the history of Bitcoin. Don't leave your money on an exchange, your coins are only safe when you have sole control over them.

I never said bitcoiners were more likely to get scammed, I said that the fact that bitcoin scams are so common that the perception that the average bitcoiner being smarter or savvy should come into question.  I'm not leveling a claim, I'm challenging a widely held (in the community) stereotype.
I don't think youre constructing the lottery metaphor correctly.  I'm saying that bitcoiners seem to be targetted by scammers more than other communities.  It would be like looking at different state lotteries and noticing that in Utah there seems to be a lot more winners than the others, suggesting that the odds of winning in utah might be higher.

Yes, he is counting on that so he can defraud you.  In history how often has a product been hyped without any details and actual delivered on such hype. Esp this guy who has a long history of stretching the truth.
The reality is when you have a real product, you dont need to brag about it before the fact. 
To add one thing: The reason hype is bullshit is because you can't predict the success of a product.  If Bitcache is some guaranteed game changer, well, you'd expect a lot more competitors to jump in.

I would say a big part of it is bitcoin peeps having this condescending attitude towards anyone who doesn't agree with them.  Your post is a prime example.
The bitcoin community has a reputation of being thin-skinned, defensive, and unobjective ("this is good for bitcoin").  You think because people don't agree with you about bitcoin that they must be retarded?  Have you thought it could be any of the following?
* Your ego is linked to bitcoin, and your discussions end up being more about winning the argument than actually educating and informing people?
* Informed people can still conclude that bitcoin is not for them.
* Bitcoin may not actually be good for people who are not tech savvy, and the risk of them getting scammed or accidentally losing coins is much higher?
Bitcoin is software, it can be improved, but there is no denying that it has things about it that could be better, and also disagreement about what features should be added / not added, but so many people here have made bitcoin into this silly vehicle for their political or economic views that I'm sure a lot of sharing about bitcoin becomes everything about that and nothing about the inherent technology, which I would guess a large percent of the user base overestimates their understanding of.

His use of the term economic Nash equilibrium shows this guy has no idea wtf he is talking about.  Exactly how does bitcoin or gold "offer an equilibrium".  The use of the words in that context doesn't make sense at all.

The Greek crisis was caused by Greece being part of the monetary union, without any avenues to control reserves or interest rates, despite mismatched gdp output and per capita income, the crisis was inevitable.  It's also why countries once interested in forming (seasia) or joining (turkey) monetary unions have backed away, preferring a national and thus sovereign currency.

Did you actually read the paper?  I'm assuming most people didn't.
1. It's a working paper and the views of the paper are not endorsed by the central bank.  Central Banks publish research all the time, [even the Fed has written on Bitcoin, and not unfavorably](  These papers are not meant to represent the view of the bank, and it's pretty common for central banks to publish papers that often argue a view that's against existing policy.
2. The paper doesn't even endorse Bitcoin, it concludes with the following:
"However, the paper notes that as the proportion of reserves held
in Bitcoin rises, the volatility of reserves would also increase. Given that the proportion of transactions done by Barbadians in digital currency is not likely to exceed 10 percent of all transactions in the short run, it is therefore recommend that if Bitcoin is incorporated into the portfolio of foreign balances of the Central Bank of Barbados, that its share should be relatively small".  It's effectively saying if the central bank of Barbados decides that its worth having BTC reserves, that they should be small.
3. The paper and the research they conduct is horrible.  Most of the paper is just a regurgitation of what is bitcoin.  And what of the actual research?  All they are doing is "modeling" what the reserve portfolio would look like if it held X% bitcoin.  I use quotation marks because calling what they're doing as modeling would be an insult to researchers.  Look at their price forecasting in the paper to see how insane what they're doing is.  In the end though, it's a paper that is assessing a country's currency holding portfolio based on price performance, which is not the point of central bank reserves, it's to reduce currency volatility, which the paper explicitly states that bitcoin does not do.
The point is this is just a academic paper from a small university in a small country.  The content of the paper does not provide any innovative ideas or research, but reads more like some back of the envelope calculations of hypotheticals with a currency/asset that is currently in the news.

Well the journalists themselves whose job is to verify the information were apparently dumb enough, so I'm not sure what you were expecting.
On the latter point, the idea is more about future proofing.  Computers over time get both faster and cheaper, so given a certain level of encryption there will likely be a point in the future where it could be economically feasible to break it.  It's unlikely any sets of supercomputers right now would be able to do it.

To say that means you don't understand what money velocity or purchasing power is.  Velocity measures money turnover, as in, within the Bitcoin economy, when I buy something from Vendor A, how quickly does Vendor A go and spend the bitcoins I gave him.  Maybe some guy is sitting on 100000 bitcoins with no intent to spend, but he alone has no actual velocity, velocity only exists in the context of the bitcoin ecosystem as a whole.
The purchasing power of the agent is really just a function of how many bitcoins he holds (and since most things you purchase in btc are actually priced in USD, really a function of bitcoins and btc/usd).  Whether the agent spends the money or not is irrelevant, as long as the agent has the option to.

You realize that without the blockchain, bitcoin is worthless right?  A lot of things are inflation proof, pretty much any cryptocoin can be if designed in that way.  So what makes bitcoin more valuable than any other alt-coin out there?  It's the fact that it's the most secure network right now.  Going around the public ledger undermines that security mechanism.


Well tell me what technical benefit (again lets avoid the politics of it as that's just an opinion) you would gain from using bitcoin off the chain over say using venmo or paypal to transfer usd or whatever your local currency is?

That is a case where the accused was innocent and denied it from the beginning.  In this case we're talking about a guy who is claiming to be Satoshi and from that the power to both profit from and destroy the image of Satoshi.  Very different cases in my view.  
Regardless, this Wright dude by now has been pretty much completely shown to be a fraud, so no need for Satoshi to rise from the grave.

The point is that the halving was known well before so given that any cause effect direct reaction should be priced in well before. It's a very basic rationale. If you know the price will go up tomorrow, the price will actually go up today, not tomorrow. 
If you want to provide a narrative that would make sense you could say that demand for btc was suppressed before the halving because of the uncertainty associated with the outcome on the system.  That would be a valid (and unprovable) theory. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 03:14:42
I would say that as someone who actually works in a front office function of trading that the conception that financial press or analysts actually drive asset prices is completely false.  Real money is driven by economic data, financial reports, and quantitative forecasting.  CNBC, WSJ, pretty much all financial press or analysis is actually just part of a big marketing machine to sell investment products and financial services to the public at large.  No real trader watches let alone is influenced by CNBC.
From that, I can say with confidence that any buyers/sellers that can influence the price of bitcoin are not gonna make a decision based on the financial press or some random analysts either.  The actual traders are the best analysts because they are driven by their own, or firm capital at stake, not by to commission / selling to consumers.

Either you don't understand what it means for a crypto to be "cracked", or you're using a non-standard definition.  Can you clarify?
@_date: 2015-12-07 15:51:01
That's not true at all, TCP/IP was a defacto standard that had no real competition.  Bitcoin is one of many competing cryptocurrencies, the one with the strongest network effect, but we could have said the same for AOL, Netscape, and Friendster at one point too.  If Bitcoin fails to provide the product/service the market wants its network effects can be eroded quickly, esp since we're still in the nascent stages.  For instance, if the use of a public ledger aka blockchain is more valuable than the crypto's tokens, then something like Ethereum can easily be viewed as superior, which is why a lot of the blockchain oriented businesses have moved in that direction.

I think part of it is our own confirmation biases right?  To a certain extent you can say Craig is out of character for Satoshi based on his limited communications, but in other ways, at least allegedly, such as his academic background, long time involvement, etc make it plausible.  I think part of it is that Satoshi has become such a mythical figure that we wouldn't want to believe he could be this douchey guy, but at the same time I wonder if there are any real humans on earth that would be able to live up to the image we've created of Satoshi.  
For the record I agree with you, I don't think it's him.  If he wanted to be outed, he would just move some coins on the genesis block; for a guy so concerned about his privacy it would make no sense to out himself through this awkward as hell media feeding frenzy.

I don't think you understand price discovery if you can think it isn't priced in. The problem with pricing the halving is that there is uncertainty to the result, so you pricing has to compensate for that risk.

Ok clearly, you don't want to understand.  Logarithmic scaling is just a way of looking at things in terms of percentage changed, not in terms of absolute points changed.  The 5% number is irrelevant, it can be 1% or 1000% and the mathematics stays the same.
Here is an explanation in laymen terms:
And here is a more technical explanation, that gives you some light into why it's used.

The point is not that you can't do off-chain transactions, but that off-chain transactions defeat the point of bitcoin.
Of course services will prefer to use off-chain transactions, both for cost, speed, and efficiency reasons.  What I'm saying is that when you do that though you are giving up all the primary technical benefits of bitcoin, in exchange.  Which is fine and within anyone's choice, but at that point where would the benefit be of using bitcoin over a standard currency?
In addition, the fees and performance costs exist for a reason, as I said they exist to finance the security of the network.
If more transactions move off-chain then the by definition the network will become less secure.  A bit at odds with each other don't you think?
So then from that logic shouldn't the thought be then rather than moving to relying on a trusted third party layer, to rather focus on the core problem of what is making the bitcoin network prohibitive for regular transactions?

Beta vs VHS is a classic dumb story people tell who don't understand what happenned.
Betamax was not superior to VHS.  From a pure visual experience standpoint Betamax was better, being 250p to VHS's 240p, but the problem with Betamax is that it was much more expensive (both tapes and players), and only allowed up to a 1 hour recording time vs VHS's 2.
The funny thing about your argument is that it actually supports my view.  Did you know that Betamax initially had 100% of the video recorder market share?  VHS actually wasn't released until a year after Beta and quickly wiped its market share out, reminding us that when a product fails to deliver on what consumers actually want (affordability, recording time being valued more than pure image quality), it can be very quickly usurped by competitors despite how much market share it has initially.

It is in complete disagreement.


I'm saying the heavy coverage by analysts and the financial press is irrelevant.  Any participant that is well capitalized enough to move the price of bitcoin is going to be doing their own research, and obviously will be aware of something as publicly known as the halving.  Just because something doesn't get JPM's 1st year out of college analyst's opinion report doesn't mean well capitalized players are just gonna dip shit their way through their investment decisions, they just do their own research and have no incentive to share it with you or the public at large; like they always have with any other asset class, companies and assets with market caps much smaller than BTC included.
My general point beyond that is that this "heavy coverage" that you think matters, only matters to ignorant retail investors, and the retail investors dont matter beyond existing to pay the spread for market makers.

I'm not sure what direction your sarcasm is intended, but off-chain txs do hurt bitcoin.  Having transactions on the public ledger is literally the point of bitcoin.
From a simplistic standpoint, the blockchain is what gives the bitcoin token fundamental value, if we eschew the ledger in favor of off-chain transactions then bitcoin literally has no benefit over using any other currency (I'm speaking technically and feature-wise not your econopolitical view on currencies), in fact it would always be inferior as in this case you would always prefer the local currency.

UDP isn't in competition with TCP, they have very different purposes.  Very basically, UDP is used when you want to broadcast data but don't need confirmation that it has been received, with the benefit of it being quicker and requiring less bandwidth, while TCP effectively confirms to the sender that the recipient received the data.  They exist concurrently.
I think it's very foolish to focus on the network effects of bitcoin right now and assume that they're too strong. 
1. Cryptocurrency is at an extremely nascent stage, it still isn't clear what it's going to even evolve to be.  In fact arguably, you can say that poor adoption despite Bitcoin achieving dominant market share suggests that BTC isn't satisfying some need in the market, meaning that the playing field is ripe for one that does to make a splash.  
2. The invested infrastructure is in mining technology that isn't directly tied to Bitcoin infrastructure, if another coin gains steam, the marginal cost for miners to move their processing power towards mining and securing that new coin is relatively small.
3. Network effects can lead to complacency.  You can argue that bitcoin may already be too big to be able to implement major changes without being stalled in gridlock. 
Factoring all those things, how can you not see that it would be very easy for a competing cryptocurrency to scale up.
I don't own Ethereum, but I keep going back to it as a very viable contender.  What if the real value of cryptocurrency truly is in the trustless but secure public ledger?  In this reverse view, the cryptocoin exists and fluctuates with the market as a means to secure the network rather than existing as a payment structure.  From the perspective of real world use-case, I see the features of Ethereum much more attractive than bitcoin.

Asset price changes are typically measured in percentage changes, so a logarithmic scale normalizes in those terms.

First of all don't quote out of context.  I said


So in regards to using Bitcoin via Coinbase for instance, then your bitcoins are absolutely seizable, in fact they already control them, you just TRUST them to give it back to you.
I'm not gonna touch the inflationary argument, you're entitled to your opinion, but on the practical transaction level this is not relevant.
And the geographic sub-region argument is also a bit silly, since in real terms, bitcoin has no region at all, are there any realistic places outside of black markets (and even then) where you can buy goods that arent ultimately priced in USD or another local currency then converted to Bitcoin?  Until Bitcoin's utility isnt tethered to its USD exchange rate that kind of argument is silly.


Spoken like someone who doesnt have a good grasp of basic economics.  That would only make sense if "layer-2" fees were originally higher than "layer-1", and there reached some break even point where "layer-1" fees due to demand rose above layer-2, pushing people to layer-2.  This of course cannot be true in this context.
This layer-2 you're talking about I'm assuming is circle or coinbase, which take advantage of offchain transactions to net and reduce costs.  So as a result Layer 2 fees &lt; Layer 1 fees, always because by definition on chain transactions cost more than off chain, so Layer 2 in this context creates an economic incentive to undermine the security of the block chain by participants who don't care enough about security to be willing to help finance the network's security.

The idea of using off-chain transactions pretty much defeats the point of using bitcoin.  In fact it undermines it by going around financing miners who secure the network, and obfuscates the truth of the blockchain.

"In another usage in statistics, normalization refers to the creation of shifted and scaled versions of statistics, where the intention is that these normalized values allow the comparison of corresponding normalized values for different datasets in a way that eliminates the effects of certain gross influences, as in an anomaly time series. Some types of normalization involve only a rescaling, to arrive at values relative to some size variable. In terms of levels of measurement, such ratios only make sense for ratio measurements (where ratios of measurements are meaningful), not interval measurements (where only distances are meaningful, but not ratios)."
Asset prices are non-normally distributed, and are non-stationary, when you convert to using asset returns, rather than prices you get something that resembles a normal distribution (lognormal if you want to technically correct).  This is why it's called "normalization".
But I'm good now, if you don't want to "believe" this is normalization then that's up to you, i'm realizing how much of a poor use of my time it is to argue pretty elementary statistics to someone who is clearly ignorant on the topic.

Like any other unit of value it's backed primarily from belief in value.  Its mathematical principals allow it to self-regulate, but it ain't worth shit unless people perceive it as having value.

Price movements like that exist all the time. Something similar just happened yesterday in equities with a big positive jump off of fomc. 
Also a random walk can form patterns like that, the thing most people don't understand is that in markets it's not normally distributed, and the walk of prices follows a distribution that tends to have negative skewness (quantification of fear) with higher kurtosis (breaking news causing price jumps in either direction)
Not to say it's completely random, but every empirical study of technical analysis has shown that outside of effects due to self fulfilling prophecy, that technical analysis has zero explanatory power. That's why the most successful traders are quant types, not some dope drawing lines on a chart to validate his own belief.

I work in proprietary trading and I have no idea where you get this notion that prop firms are already involved in BTC.  I'm sure some desks out there are experimenting with trading/making markets in BTC, but that work at best would be a side project.  The market is still too tiny in fin market terms to warrant any significant expenditure of resources.

Theoretically Kane could buy a bitcoin and it can never reach 200 or 2000 and sit somewhere in between forever (or for simplification the price sits at his purchase price indefinitely).  From a pure financial engineering standpoint he would be paying for the opportunity cost of having to hold that bitcoin to hedge (aka he could have put that cash in a treasury and earned some minutia of interest).  So technically he does have a lose window, but I'm just being technical for the sake of completeness.  Realistically it's a win-win bet for Kane.

Your whole analogy is based on an assumption that your purchasing power would increase if there was no QE, which I can understand that it seems very logical, is not necessarily a good assumption, because it ignores money velocity.
You can see that in reality, think about how many trillions of dollars have been basically dumped into the global economy for the last decade.
In japan they've been pumping money into the system for 30 years, and not only has there been no inflation, they're still trying to stop prices from falling!
I know this is unintuitive; you think more money in the system prices have to go up, but that isn't always true, money velocity, risk aversion, and many other factors also have huge impacts on inflation as well.
I'm not arguing with you because I'm trying to win a debate, I just want you to consider being more open minded about the real effects of QE because what you think *should* happen, hasn't happened.  If you start digging deeper, you will find an amazing and very interesting world.
I often compare it to being introduced to quantum mechanics after living your entire life under the assumptions of classical/newtonian physics.
Just to add, real inflation is a theft from savers to borrowers, but real deflation is theft from borrowers to savers.  Savers are consumers, borrowers are producers.  We only see things from the anti-inflation perspective because most of us are consumers, but if we fuck over producers we will fuck over our economy, in simple terms.

The Swiss franc rallied because of its safe haven status. The snb has been trying to keep the exchange rate low to be competitive with the euro. (They're a small primarily export centric economy). With the incoming euro zone qe, the snb pretty much had no choice but to abandon the chf usd ceiling.  This was a preemptive move in reaction to the euro. If you're gonna criticize a central bank, I think the snb is a terrible choice, there is a reason why chf rallied like this and it's because the world views it as one of the safest currencies.

I can understand if you dont think inflation is negative, but you get the big picture that its real rates that matter, aka the spread between nominal rates and inflation is what matters.
So yes what youre saying is that if inflation is &gt; nominal rates, it is a basically a tax/theft on stored labor.  Definitely agree.  Where people fuck up in their logic is not being able to see beyond their own perspective.  
Deflation is the opposite, and from the saver/consumer side it is (in the short term good), I am rewarded for saving by getting growing purchasing power.  The problem is that it completely ignores the supply side.  Deflation is savers "stealing" from borrowers.  Who are borrowers?  In general they are people who are investing and expanding the economy, so a deflationary environment discourages them from investing in the future, because their expected profitability drops because prices are falling.  If they dont expand then there will be less jobs, lower wages, and less incentive to take risk and innovate, hence a deflationary spiral, just like how we can have an inflationary spiral on the opposite extreme.
In the end inflation/deflation are just two sides of a coin, inflation transfers value from savers to borrowers, deflation transfers value from borrowers to savers.  To take this axiomatic stance that inflation is bad and deflation is good is ignorant at best.

Yes, what you're saying is kind of correct, but to say prediction markets are known for being very accurate is incorrect, and actually implies a half baked understanding of how they work.  Let's use a simple scenario where we know the distribution; a coin flip.  The consensus price of a coin flip that pays 1 for heads and 0 for tails is 0.5.  However because it is a binary distribution, the actual outcome can never be 0.5.  If you didn't know the distribution of a coin flip, does it tell you anything about the possible future outcomes?  Nope.  It could be 0,1, or -1,+2, or any possible scenarios that average out to 0.5, that's also assuming a symmetric distribution, which is a really bad assumption, since asset prices can't go below 0, but upside is technically infinite.
Yes the current bitcoin price is the best guess of the consensus mean, but that tells you nothing about the distribution of price/returns.  You can't know the probability of X price being achieved if you don't know the shape of the distribution.  All the consensus mean tells you is that given the current price S of bitcoin, that T periods in the future the expected MEAN price of bitcoin is S (assuming no drift).

It's not artificially low, it's low because one of their operating costs, financing, has gone down.  That's a real cost.
All the things you're saying in general are absolutely correct though, and why deflation is such a strong force in the global economy right now.
The point though is that there is no "theft", at least in the context OP stated, which I'm assuming he is echoing about a positive differential between inflation and interest rates eating away at your purchasing power.  We are literally in the opposite scenario at this moment.

But to have that article upvoted would mean that other people had to take the risk and pay before you to read the content.  See the problem with that?  Someone has to subsidize you by vetting the content first, not only that, free/ad-driven pages will get way more views and will be far more likely to get to the front page as well.
When it comes to news and articles you dont know the value of the content until after you consume it, which means you have to take a risk to read an article.  This is why a microtransaction model wouldnt be optimal in this case, and why sites with paywalls strongly prefer a subscription model, because they can focus on building their reputation and overall content, rather than trying to get you to click on individual articles.

You would only think that if you simplistically assume the utility of money is linear, but it's not.  I can construct a very simple extreme scenario that shows you that.
Let's say you have a disease that will kill you tomorrow unless you can pay $50million to buy the cure.  Unfortunately for you you're dirt poor, and the only possible way to get that money is to win tonight's lotto drawing.  Do you buy a ticket even if it has a negative expected value?  Of course.  Now let's say someone offered you 1million to not buy a ticket, would you accept it?  No, a rational person that wants to live will still buy the ticket, so literally in this case the ticket is worth more than 1mm to you, despite the expected value being negative.  This is because you value the dispersion of outcomes as I noted before, any other game with a higher expected value but a max payout of less than 50mm is worth less.
Now if you generalize that thought exercise it's pretty obvious why they're INDIVIDUAL utility curves, and why they're typically non-linear.

You can have a conflict of interest and not be a sellout...  you realize though that Bitcoin is an open source project right?  Bitcoin is not owned by core, and if the community at large disagrees with their branch of code, then people will use a different branch.

I think its the 0 value that confuses people because they're used to positive inflation.  If you just shift the axis it might become more intuitive.
Let's say that the interest rate was 20% and inflation was 18%, then there would not be theft right?  You actually have a positive carry by hording cash.  This is also true if the rate is 0 and inflation is -2%.
The part that gets people mixed up is that they assume that at the 0 rate people will borrow money "for free" and buy shit up, but what's free is not the money, it's the time value of money, you ultimately have to repay that debt.  So if I can borrow at 0% but the risk-adjusted expected return on all assets I want to invest in is negative would I borrow money?  No, not even if its free, and that's why despite almost a decade of declining rates we still are failing to create inflation.

Yes, I literally said I was making a hypothetical guess, but here's why 1000 is more realistic than millions.  
All Netflix said was that they're open to Bitcoin, of course they'll say that, but if the # was really close to millions, you bet they would announce that they were working on implementing it.
The other supporting fact is that the majority of companies that accept Bitcoin as a method of payment have seen disappointing sales amid initial hype.  Everyone in this reddit talks big about spending, but that never translates into actual spending.  They just want positive news to pump the coins their holding.  It's dishonest and probably hurts them in the long run.
Not to mention the fact that given the current block size, that processing just 1mm new transactions would take more than a month this is just silly pie in the sky talk, that ignores the technological and economic issues.

Ask yourself, in a deflationary economy, why do prices fall?  Prices fall due to lack of aggregate demand, and this lack of aggregate demand puts DOWNWARD pressure on wages.  Workers get less money, so they can't buy things, they expect prices to fall so they wait to make consumption purchases, this puts downward pressure on prices again, which leads to more downward pressure on wages.  So sure in a deflationary economy you're better off than someone with a lot of debt, but you're still in a shit position.  Just look at the real world.
The countries that have been most heavily impacted by deflation are saver countries, Japan being the most obvious example.  They have had stagnant real GDP growth for over a three decades now, their population is dying off as they watch their neighboring economies (SK, China) become stronger and stronger.

There is a difference between expected value and expected utility.
You have a 0.99999999...9 probability of losing, but the pain from that loss is also insignificant.  The prob of winning is 1-X (not factoring in taxes, split payouts etc), but the utility gained from that is massive.
So the game has an expected value of less than the ticket, but the dispersion of outcomes can be valuable.
Let's say you are stuck in a regular 9 to 5 job that will pay you 60k a year forever, but with no real upside.  Buying a lottery ticket and winning, though with very small odds, is still greater than the chance of it happening otherwise in your life.  Therefore you might get more utility out of that probabilistic upside, and as a result value the ticket at more than just the expected value.  
It's not as stupid of an economic decision as people make it out to be.

I don't understand your analogy. I'm assuming potatoes are like your money, so lets just work through this step by step.
1. Interest rates are 0.
So if on day 1 i have 100 potatoes, then on day 2 i have 100 potatoes.
2. Inflation is negative.  Prices are falling.
So on day 1 I can trade 1 potato for 1 apple.  On day 2 I can trade 1 potato for 2 apples.
Where is the theft?  (Or clarify how your analogy relates at all to the actual scenario we're talking about).

I did qualify it by saying typically, but it is very common in here for people to give libertarian talking points without ever having thought about the impact of such changes.
I've studied patent laws and innovation, there is an observable effect because not all countries have the same or any patent laws.  Patent laws have interesting effects on innovation.  Strong patent laws tend to cause countries to innovate with big ideas, the US has very strong patent laws and we are still one of the greatest innovators of "big ideas", because you can protect the yields via patent.
Countries with weak patent laws tend to have innovation appear in more technical aspects.  For instance Switzerland has some of the weakest patent laws in the world, and if you look at where they innovate you can see the effect of the laws.  Rather than innovating with big ideas, they innovate via skill.  This is why Switzerland is known to make the best watches, chocolates, etc.  This is because the lack of patent protection drives individuals and companies to innovate in ways that are hard to replicate, such as the skill in making fine watches.
Basically companies are looking for ways to maximize their competitive edge for a given legal environment.  If they lack patent protection, then naturally companies will be driven towards less risky innovations, and innovations that are more easily kept as trade secrets or create/have barriers to entry.

I mean all you have to do is listen to the chatter about surveilling messaging after the Paris attacks, I dont know how you can feel at ease that the internet will not be increasingly monitored and filtered.


I didn't say that.  I was just speaking generally that the government has eyes that can see more, and hands that can reach farther than ever before.  The rights you have are only given to you because the government allows it, and right now that's fine, but there could be a future where maybe that's not the case.  How close was the world to succumbing to complete totalitarianism just 60 years ago?  If that were to happen today, with the technological reach the government has now I don't think there would be any way for individuals to fight back.

McGill is a fine university, but if we're talking about universities, providing education is really a tertiary aspect.  
Private university education in the United States is very expensive, but at the same time the reputation, body of research and work that comes out of United States universities, utterly dwarfs the output of pretty much every university in the rest of the world combined.
Which is why despite exorbitant (to a rational person) cost of education, tuition inflation continues to outpace aggregate inflation.  The fact is (and easy access to student loan debt is partly to blame) that demand continues to outpace supply for US higher education.

That can change in the future, but I'm not gonna put weight on somebody's prediction X years into the future when they can't even figure out something obvious about today.
Also just to address your argument about the "inflation" of foreign goods.  First of all unless they're buying commodities in the outright markets, the prices dont adjust immediately.  If they go to a Uniqlo or American based retailer in Shanghai the prices are still the same.  Likely the currency differential will be absorbed by the companies.
Secondly, to say that that is inflation is just looking at different sides of a coin.  You can argue that prices were artificially depressed because the Chinese were keeping a tight peg on the exch rate, and now they reflect the correct value.  In fact the latter is probably more technically correct.

No, colloquially speaking if you say inflation, most people will understand you're talking about price inflation.  This is also true in economic and finance circles.
When the fed says they're looking at an inflation target of 2% they're definitely not talking about the supply of money.

The economic reason is because they lease or borrow to buy their mining gear, and pay for their workers in local currency.  Therefore at some point they have to convert some of their revenue (in BTC) to local currency to pay their overhead/liabilities (employees, borrowing/leasing costs/ electricity /rent, misc operating costs).  Whatever they can leave as bitcoin is a function of their profitability.

Explain the US and EU.  Too short term?  Well then explain Japan which has been aggressively expanding their money supply for about 30 years and even now they're still fending off deflation.
Obviously inflation can rear its head in the future, but it's pretty idiotic to worry about some possible future threat, when deflation is staring you down.

In a vacuum where there is only money supply and goods with fixed supply and demand, yes you'd be correct, but that is not the real world.  
Which brings me back to my point that bitcoin people are obsessed with money supply.  Things like global exchange rates, economic cycles, money velocity, supply and demand, growth rate of population, fiscal policies, and a litany of other things can and often have a much stronger effect than simple changes to money supply.  These things have both short and long run impacts on inflation/deflation, and to focus on one as the end all implies a very myopic or limited understanding of "economic principles".  
It also comes to no surprise to me that you wouldn't be aware of Japan because the situation is a counterpoint to your view, and then to say it doesn't apply (how would you know that given you admit you know little about it), tells me that you just want to validate your own viewpoint.

Yes, and Bitcoin does clear the market.  Go into any major btc exchange and there is a bid and ask at a tight market.

The cost side isn't relevant in the short term for finding equilibrium, and it could dictate that mining is too expensive not necessarily that Bitcoin is too cheap.

Uhh, you have no idea what you're talking about, I work in HFT, and I have friends at DRW, and its pretty well established that DRW is a market making firm, this is not some secret.  They're an HFT prop trading firm like many others.
The fact remains if DRW is loaning coins to someone to sell short, they're long that position, so why would it ever be in their interest to do that?  
The other fact that people here fail to realize is that the market cap on bitcoin is tiny, and if you knew anything about DRW you'd know they're primarily a Eurodollar trading firm, which has open interest in the trillions.  The idea that they would give a shit about making a few million (and in this case you're describing it would actually be losing) on a one off trade in some esoteric unregulated product is delusional.

Yes, and I noted Arca, the point of my post was that the trading halt on the NYSE exchange was pretty much irrelevant, with the only potential issue being that if it didn't come back online at end of day, issues with settlement pricing could arise.  My prior post was mostly written out of annoyance given that people here always complain about outsiders deriding bitcoin without a good understanding of it, and here they are making claims about something that most people in this thread clearly do not understand.  This is pretty much true for any topic related to finance/economics (remember the push to get Greeks to adopt bitcoin in reaction to the freezing of bank assets?)
The greatest irony though is that as bitcoin is only becoming more and more centralized (due to exorbitant costs and technology required to mine and process), if anything US equity markets have become increasingly decentralized to the point where the main discussion is whether they're TOO fragmented and decentralized.

@_date: 2015-07-08 20:18:04
I get what you mean, but you're making a semantic argument.  Based on your logic, you can say that bitcoin is not actually decentralized because it's still controlled by a subpopulation (and increasingly a cartel) of miners.
However the point is that decentralization is not a binary state, and can exist in varying degrees.

Though I don't really get it, future hard forks are not only an inevitability, but a feature of Bitcoin (or any open source project).  It's really the main mechanism that prevents a bad actor from implementing code against the will of the user base. 
If the fork gains consensus it is the new main chain, if it doesn't then nobody adopts it and it's as if it never existed. Instead of arguing theoretically which is better let the user base decide. If a hard fork has the potential to destroy Bitcoin, then Bitcoin isn't fit to survive.

If you think bitcoin's killer app is remittance, then it's likely that you have done little or no research or thought on it.  As you're aware the fee structure is already prohibitive for remittance to most local currencies due to illiquid markets, but regardless, the only reason why Bitcoin remittance has existed unfettered to this point is because the amount of actual "remittance" Bitcoin does is paltry and insignificant.

You don't understand basic economic principles to say that.  With respect to miners, there is no regulatory environment that causes this, it's the nature of the business.  
Businesses with very high fixed costs that produce commodity goods will naturally trend towards monopoly.  Just think about it logically:
1. The cost of hardware has made the barrier of entry very high
2. The only way to lower per unit cost to produce bitcoin is through economies of scale, lowering the effect of fixed costs.
3. Given that it is a commodity good, as margins thin, only the lowest cost producers can stay in business, driving weaker players out.
This isn't a theoretical exercise though, you see it in actual mining, and other forms of high fixed cost commodity production.  This entire sector is run and controlled by a handful of firms like Glencore

He writes on, but it can be simplified:
1. Anything can be a store of value
2. Some things are better proxies for storing value than others.
3. Those good qualities are fungibility, stability, and liquidity.
So saying that something is a store of value is like saying something is a thing.  Meaningless, what matters is whether it has qualities that make it good for being that.  
Now that's an esoteric thought, but it translates well to real life.  Can I buy the same amount of bread a week from now with that same store of value?  
1. It has to be stable, if today my store of value can buy 1 loaf of bread, I should expect it to buy 1 loaf of bread 1 week from now, not half a loaf, or 10 loafs.
2. It also has to be fungible, my store of value is worth the same 1 loaf of bread a week later, but if I want I should be able to buy half a loaf or 10 loafs.
3. My store of value needs to be liquid, if I go to any store will they accept my store of value in exchange for bread?. 
How many of those qualities does bitcoin satisfy right now?  I would say fungibility is the only one; so no at this point in its lifecycle it is not a good store of value.

Ok first of all the role of speculation in the price discovery process has nothing to do with the underlying asset.  
A lot of assets that generate no cash flow, no intrinsic value, and little of any practical use trade all the time, pretty much any bio-tech company that went public in the last two years.  But whatever you're entitled to your opinion but I'm not really pro-bitcoin so I don't really care about your thoughts on it.
But the idea that you think that bitcoin exists for rent extraction is making some kind of insight is downright idiotic, that's the whole point of intermediaries.  Saying that bitcoin trading exists for intermediaries to extract rent is about as enlightening as saying a store (the intermediary) sells its products (underlying asset) over cost to earn a profit margin, duh-doy.

I can't speak for the rest of the world, but given the economics its probably the case in most places, but my energy provider has a localized monopoly on power service.
However, despite being your only choice, a service like ConEd doesnt actually produce all of the power that it's sending to you, it actually does something similar to what the article states, where it is monitoring power demand and will buy electricity based on current and projected demand from power plants.  Structurally, on the supply side, there are many contracts setup such that if the demand for power exceeds $X per kwh, to turn on the plant etc.
However, I don't understand how this could occur on the consumer side, since the access to the power lines that go into your home are owned by someone, and unless a competitor wants to come in and build an entire power grid (aka impossible), that won't change.
Also the ability for variable cost pricing is completely independent of bitcoin, it could be a way to setup algorithmic payments via smart contracts, but that is completely hypothetical, and even unlikely since it seems like the direction bitcoin is going would make high frequency on-block transaction such as that unfeasible.

Yes, you'd want to, but the people you would be paying to, also don't want your cash, so they will be unlikely to change their policies to take on negative interest rate carry.

I will explain to you why deflationary effects are extremely strong and predictable:
1. Demographics, in the developed world population growth is on the decline.  Notice how our most inflationary period in recent history is correlated with the birth and rise of the baby boomers.  Now ask yourself what will happen to all those homes in the suburbs as they die off?
2. Technology, if you want a trip, take a look at interest rates and inflation and if you look at the point where the downward trend started?  It coincides with the introduction of the PC.  Gains in productivity puts downward pressure on demand for labor, suppressing wages.  As the movement towards automation continues expect this trend not only to go on, but to increase.
Now let's look at the real world, you say that the banks are manipulating rates.  I'm assuming that you believe the natural rate would be higher, since bank buying is putting artificial downward pressure on rates.
But are rates not just an indicator of demand for borrowing?  If in fact the fed was pushing rates artificially lower, then you would expect then that borrowing demand would be artificially inflated and create inflation that would spread into the economy.  But what has happened? Central Banks have been buying assets and pushing rates to 0 and below for almost a decade now and have STILL failed to create price inflation, a testament to how strong deflationary effects are, and a fact that suggest that not only are rates not artificially low, that they in fact need to be lower to offset deflationary effects.
I agree that there are definite "black swans" in the waiting, but by definition it cant be something so widely claimed and predicted as coming inflation or a 2016 economic downturn.  If anything the black swan would be if we saw continued deflation and a massive rally in 2016.

Sigh, people who are whipped into a frenzy about their coco bonds don't understand what coco bonds are, which in reality are more like preferred shares than actual debt.  
The fact that there is a possibility they might "fail" to pay the coupon has more to do with preference than an issue of solvency.  If the yield curve continues to flatten then paying 7.5% on a bond that you can just convert to equity is idiotic.  Of course this will have a diluting effect on their equities, which pushes their stock price down.  Of course all this is speculation on the *possibility* it might happen in 2017.
This is a signal that they will be less profitable, which makes sense, with long yields dropping you expect ALL banks to be less profitable, but this is incorrectly being interpreted by uninformed people as a liquidity issue.  There isn't some sort of hidden debt here like we saw in 2007, all the issues are out in the open, and with that their credit spread has blown to what? 250bps.

It's so obvious that 2016 will be a disaster, that it's probably not going to be.
Pretty much every bozo in the world is calling 2016 potentially catastrophic, if it were to happen, it would be the most forecasted market crash in history, which is oxymoronic. 
The other reality is that this downturn will likely not be as bad, the vast majority of bad debt in the system is isolated to China, is already being crushed, but because China's banking is not very interwoven into the global banking system, there isn't that chain reaction fear that caused panic in 07/08.  China is also still a net exporter, so the macro effect of their decline is you guessed it, the theme of the rest of our lives, deflation.
Which brings to my attention one HUGE risk to bitcoin that nobody seems to be thinking about when people mention BTC should rise because of market turmoil.  
I think it could rise, but it will be due to Chinese buying it as a way to move capital out of China.  However, if that buying becomes serious, it makes bitcoin suddenly a realistic threat to their capital controls.  With the majority of hashpower in China, their government could easily take control for the sake of stopping Bitcoin from being used as a way to evade their cap controls, which obviously has disastrous possible outcomes for BTC.

Some of your statements are contradictory.  For instance, if there was a loss of faith in central bankers then why would bonds be bid to negative yield, effectively paying central banks to hold their cash?  Why is there not an increase on the credit spread on government bonds?
Only people uninformed on the basic tenets of price discovery would have expected gold to tumble on a well anticipated fed hike.
Gold has rallied for the first month or so of this year after declining steadily for what 3 or 4 years now?  And now suddenly people are jumping on the ship again?  I've seen this story before, and it always ends with the longs saying "this time will be different" before the market eventually corrects.  Perhaps this time is different, but the underlying dynamics of this market have not changed in a way that suggests that is the case.  
In fact I remember very clearly gold rallying at the start of 2015 and the same dim wits proclaiming that 2015 would be the year of gold.  Funny how that turned out.
The reality is that we're in a strongly deflationary environment and will probably continue to be for the rest of our lives, and if you don't realize that then you are doomed to make poor decisions.
Prices are dropping again as we see a flight to quality (again quality still seems to be govt bonds), but since inflation is still depressed, the inevitable downturn in our economy will lead to new rounds of QE along with low yields continuing to filter out towards the long end.  Once that occurs the search for yield will continue which will again as it has for the last 30 years put upward pressure on equities.
Buying gold as part of some underlying belief that inflation is around the corner means ignoring empirical realities.

The problem with your logic is that the distribution of outcomes along the average is not a mirrored distribution (due to 0 bound, think of a lognormal dist), the reality is that confirm times are heavily positively skewed, such that if your transaction goes through exceptionally fast you won't notice much of a difference, but you will notice if it is exceptionally slower.
The bigger problem with that is aside from raising fees (and even  that is just improving your odds) you have no way of predicting when a block confirm will happen quickly or be delayed to shit for any given transaction.

Bitcoin in the eyes of big money is just another speculative tech stock, with tech funding beginning to dry up and the end of nasdaq bubble 2.0 it's not a shock to me that bitcoin is going to take a massive haircut as a large segment of holders are going to be seeking liquidity.

Inflation expectations can often be much more important than actual inflation.  People's perception of strength and weakness in currency drives consumer behavior, look at any country that has suffered from heavy inflation (pre-Real Brazil), or heavy deflation (90s Japan).
True it doesnt affect people's expenditures on staple goods, and necessities, but marginal spending is definitely impacted and that's what drives the growth of economies.  
If you expected luxury good X is going to cost 90 tomorrow as opposed to 100 today, you're probably going to wait a day, and if the opposite were the case you would buy it today, it's simple rational behavior that shows itself in aggregate.  It doesn't even matter if you know what the price of tomorrow will be (you can't), it's what you believe that will drive your behavior.

I'm not saying there are any bad apples, just that the technological costs and barriers for mining have made it so that mining is becoming increasingly concentrated into the hands of a few big miners, and for instance with the coming possibility of a fork, it's that group not necessarily bitcoin users/holders that will choose the winning fork.
2-3 cents is meager, but that is because right now the system is subsidizing miners, that is by no means guaranteed in the future, and most of all you don't have much of a say in that.

1. Risky in an asset price sense, Bitcoin is risky in that its value in dollars is uncertain.  I'm sure you have assumed already that it will be some kind of global reserve currency in a few years, but in the real world that is not a certainty, and definitely not a possibility in the short term.
2. Investors aren't going to move from one volatile asset to another.  Have you ever heard of the term risk on/ risk off.  When there is a big move lower in equities, that is risk off, so people sell high volatility equities, and buy lower risk assets such as treasuries and cash.  The term implies that the view goes from taking risk to earn excess returns to a focus on capital preservation.

Any correlation derived from movements of bitcoin during financial crises is also spurious.  If the markets are crashing, any one who is intelligent is not gonna take that money and put it into an even more risky and speculative asset.

How am I contradicting myself... lets say they promise a return of 50% a month on your money.
guy A puts in 100 bitcoins, he recruits 2 other guys that put in 100 bitcoins.
At the end of the month guy A gets paid 50 bitcoins.  
In the system right now there are 250 bitcoins.  If they liquidate that 250 bitcoins then the system collapses because the two new recruits wont get paid.  But if you know the scheme is still growing why would you ever do that?  The answer is you dont.
Instead, you pay 50 bitcoins to the 2 new recruits, they go ahead and each get themselves 2 recruits that pay in 100 bitcoin.  Where are you at with bitcoins now?
Now the system has 550 bitcoin (+700 from the investment by all the members, -150 paid out to the first 3).  This growth is exponential.
So when do you pull the rug and liquidate the coins?  When you start seeing that new recruits arent able to recruit new people anymore.
In the meanwhile, you cant liquidate the bitcoins (nor do you really need to) because the outflows are fixed, but incoming bitcoin flows are random (aka you pay out at the end of every month, but youre receiving coins randomly throughout the month), so you need a buffer.
Once the scam is over you launder the coins and eventually sell them for cash.

That is incorrect.  The "damaging" effect on attacking TUV using BTC is from the secondary effects of cross exchange arbitrage, aka changes to the TUV/AUD TUV/USD etc.  To fight that the IMF would just need to sell USD or AUD and buy TUV.  The IMF would not need to touch BTC, as its exchange rate with the TUV has no impact on that country's economy.
Just to add though this is a completely theoretical exercise as an attacker on TUV has nothing to gain from doing this.  The economic reason why you would attack a currency is if a country is trying to maintain a peg, and an attack is a way to force a devaluation, which would make your short of that currency profitable.  In a floating currency market youre just moving rates that might have economic implications, but no clear exit.  You sell TUV/BTC forever, but at some point you have to cover your short and buy back the TUV/BTC, unlike in a peg scenario, there is no guarantee you wont get squeezed trying to exit (aka everyone in the world knows you have to buy back a ton of TUV, you think they're gonna sell it to you cheap?), thus making the attack highly risky and mostly pointless.

That is just straight up incorrect.  USD is fungible just as much as steel or wheat is.  The fact that the government enforces a monopoly over its production is irrelevant.  Many countries have state owned mining companies, does that make the gold those firms dig out of the ground any less of a commodity?
There is only one distinguishing quality that defines what a commodity is and that's fungibility.
Also it's not as if being a currency and being a commodity are mutually exclusive.  Practically speaking, a currency is a type of commodity used as a unit of account.  This is because fungibility is an important quality to the usability of a currency.

If they created a dynamic hedging system that could work, but the problem is that if you're to allow clients to pull coins out immediately and at any time, you will be CONSTANTLY hedging, in and out.  Accounting for transaction costs, and bid/ask spread pay up costs its almost certainly cost prohibitive.

The point still stands, lets say I "attack" Tuvalu's currency (let's call it TUV for simplicity), I sell TUV and buy BTC.  I drive up the price of BTC relative to TUV.  What consequence does this have on the economy of Tuvalu?
The direct effect is none, because the economy of Tuvalu does effectively no import or export that relies on the BTC/TUV exchange rate.
On a secondary effect, if the price of BTC/TUV increase, then via cross exchange arbitrage on BTC/USD, you could see TUV/USD, TUV/AUD, TUV/NZD weaken, and therefore have an effect on the economy.
However- if your goal was to attack the currency of TUV, then it made no sense to use BTC then, you would just sell TUV/USD in the first place, and leave BTC wholly out of the equation.  From the perspective of the attacker using BTC would be a more expensive, less direct and effective way to attack TUV.
The basic point to take away from this is that for a currency to be used in a speculative attack it needs to have relevance to that economy.  If you want to attack the canadian dollar, you would use the USD, because a lot of people rely on that exchange rate to conduct business, so until BTC is an integral part of a given country's economy, it would never make sense to use it as an angle to attack that country's currency.

I'm not sure how you would expect the large percentage of the population that doesn't have regular access to the internet, let alone smart phones, to be able to conduct regular business using bitcoin, not to mention the fact that bitcoin's own volatility is enough to make most hyperinflationary (generally defined as about &gt; 30% inflation/year) currencies blush.
Realistically the countries that are most vulnerable to hyperinflation are not modernized enough technologically to be able to use bitcoin meaningfully.
Regardless bitcoin is years and years away from having the capacity to be used as an actual currency, even if there was a small, high tech country that had a desire to switch.
Another factor that people don't seem to ever bother considering when it comes to a nation-state switching to bitcoin is that mining is stratified across many countries, though concentrated in a few places (china for instance), if you were a sovereign country, how comfortable would you feel if your money and economy were dependent on the infrastructure of a far away country?

Wow, if you're gonna act like a know it all, it would help to have some basic understanding of what youre talking about
The scheme is paid in and out via bitcoin.  Aka the bitcoins that are bought in by new members, are sent to pay the "dividends" on members higher up on the pyramid, with the money trickling up.  By continuing to payout, they attract new members, and the aggregate pool of bitcoins goes up.
If they liquidated it immediately, they wouldn't be able to pay "dividends" to members and the scheme would collapse right there on the spot.  By holding off they are accumulating more and more bitcoin.  When the growth and ability to recruit new people to the scheme slows to unsustainable levels, that's when they liquidate and the scheme collapses, and the guys at the top of the pyramid run with the profits.

That's not true, it depends on how stable liquidity is in the market, if liquidity will pull as you start selling in small batches, it can have the effect of encouraging others to sell, and people posting bids to cancel or pull back.  Often times you can get a better average buy/sell price by just trading through the book, depending on how much you need to get done and how much liquidity is posted.  Whether it encourages additional selling ex-post is irrelevant to you as long as you maximize your sell price.

You cant just cherry pick cases and assume that it's some kind of rule, there are countless cases where the defacto standard has changed.  TCP/IP is a poor comparison as it was a defined standard from the start, and effectively did not have competition.  This is hardly the case with Bitcoin, which not only has had competition from pretty much the start (litecoin), but is also at threat from new entrants (ethereum).
Things that are more comparable are early web search, social media, file-sharing services; models that like bitcoin benefited and relied heavily on strong network effects, but were ultimately supplanted by other services.  That is not to say that Bitcoin is likely to be supplanted, but it's that arrogance in believing that at the very nascent stages of cryptocurrency, that Bitcoin is certain to be the standard in cryptocurrency is the exact attitude that gets it obsoletized.

This is a weird article that bunches together random quotes, and titles it in a way that suggests a btc based speculative attack is imminent or at least a possibility.  Unfortunately the idea of a speculative attack on a currency via BTC, which right now is impossible, also makes absolutely zero economic sense.
Lets say I were a well capitalized player with billions in capital, and I had a goal of devaluing the USD with respect to BTC.  I sell USD, and I buy BTC, driving up the price of BTC relative to USD (hence weakening USD).
Now what?  The USD is weak relative to BTC.  Does that matter to anyone at all outside of BTC speculators?  The answer is no, it doesn't matter at all.  A speculative attack only matters if it affects relevant cross currencies.  When George Soros attacked the GBP, he drove its price down relative to the USD, Deutsche Mark, etc.  Currencies that are relevant because the UK imports goods that are denominated in those currencies.  This causes pressure on the UK economy, and as a result the central bank had to act.  
A speculative attack on USD via BTC would drive up BTC/EUR, BTC/GBP etc, but is very unlikely to have a material impact on the relevant crosses such as EUR/USD, GBP/USD etc.
Factor in that it would take selling of hundreds, maybe thousands of times the entire market cap of BTC to make the slightest dent in USD, you realize how dumb all of this is.

You pay taxes on gold returns.  I'm fairly certain the law exists so that tourists traveling aren't required to pay taxes due to the gains/losses that may have incurred from time on their trip.

The irony of the situation is that Greece needs a currency it can inflate to get out of this situation, but of course so many bitcoin people with a half-witted understanding of Austrian economics, and blind hate of Keynesian economics, seem to believe that the remedy to any economic crisis is bitcoin.

Yes, but you're forgetting the fact that time and energy was "spent" to create that money, hence the person mining it has valued it at equal to or greater than the cost of that time and energy.

Are you actually one of those few people who use bitcoin for day to day transactions, or like pretty much everyone else here a speculator on the price?  
Either way, if you have less than 200 in gains to report, the IRS is not gonna care.

There's truth to that despite your sarcasm. Right now Bitcoin isn't very useful, if it was, well people would adopt and use it. As it stands Bitcoin is still mostly a speculative vehicle.

The Bitcoin white paper suggests that the person behind it comes from academic circles, since the paper has all the details of an science academic paper, it was even written using LaTeX scripting which outside of math and science academia isn't really seen or used.
Also C++ is definitely learnable, and SN's code wasn't amazing or anything, BUT, the details in the code, including comments, and the fact that a lot of the code deals with lower level memory management suggests that whoever wrote it has to have at least a pretty solid computer science background, of which Kleiman at least based on his work history would not, working in IT and IT security is not the same at all.
It's definitely possible, but if I were a betting man, I would say no, it's unlikely this dude with no known background in mathematics, computer science, and programming was at around the age of 40 able to, while barely making ends meet, learn crytography, C++, network programming; write an entire protocol and put out an academic quality refined whitepaper.

It's not scalable, if 1% of starbucks customers used it the demand for starbucks gifts cards would increase such that it's unlikely foldapp would be able to profitably offer a 20% discount.  The "innovation" of foldapp is about the discount market for gift cards and has very little to do with bitcoin.

Think of it this way, the IMF holding bitcoin would be an effect of bitcoin becoming a legitimate global currency.  Not the other way around.

The supply of chairs, is one critical aspect of the value of chairs relative to another good.  
If you were a chair maker, you're gonna be less willing to give up 1 chair for one chicken, if you had 1 chair vs 1000.  Therefore marginally speaking, every chair added to your supply causes the price of chickens in terms of chairs to increase.  You can replace chairs with anything, fiat, gold, turkeys, the equation stays the same.

That is my point, half a decade of development on this thing and they have no economic incentive for people to create nodes, half a decade to get this thing in beta.

If I had to guess people who pay for music and people who are technologically savvy enough to pay using bitcoin are on opposite ends of a spectrum.

To a certain extent they're both 100% wrong.  The world of today is far too complex, far too nuanced, and riddled with extreme and unexpected outcomes, that anyone that tries to apply a rigid economic framework to things will be made nothing more than a fool.
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:10:09
I disagree. I think it attempts to solve existing problems such as “trust” but with the realities of economies of scale and ever decreasing mining rewards bitcoin is increasingly becoming centralized,  I think the idea that bitcoin is trustless is dying, and the reality that it’s operates more like a cartel like opec is setting in.

In actual use, I would say monero has already surpassed bitcoin.
raw speculation of course bitcoin is top dog, but basing the likelihood of future success as a function of the amount of speculation is a foolhardy gambit.

Network effects are critical, but given we are in infancy technical aspects of the "coin" is more important.  The problem with bitcoin is that it's technically poor, after a decade of "growth" it pretty much still has the same issues that have been plaguing it for years, slow confirm times, economic incentives to create nodes, etc.  Progress is being made, but at an iceberg's pace.  
With switching costs low, if a real mainstream use case were to appear, the technically superior coin has a much better chance to win out.  I mean look at bitcoin's only real use case today, buying drugs on the darknet, in this case it's already been usurped by monero, which offers superior privacy.  Network effects were not enough to overcome its technological disadvantage.

Just like Friendster and Myspace.  Not to mention that McDonald's wasn't the first fast food chain, it was the one that learned from the others (Bob's Big Boy is where the idea for the Big Mac was taken from), and was able to take off from there completely crushing the early entrants that "innovated" the industry.
Given switching costs for miners is relatively low, and the fact that bitcoin after nearly a decade mired in technical bureaucracy has barely evolved, it would make sense that a cheaper, but technically superior coin will come out on top.  That is if a mainstream use case is even found.

I find it would be generally off putting for consumers to have to pay a fee to optimize their confirmation time.  It's like paying shipping costs to send money.  
This sort of charge would likely have to be obfuscated from consumers, such as embedding it in the cost from the seller, similar to credit cards.

There is obviously inflation, in a barter economy the unit of account is a given good.  If for example a good being traded is chairs, then every single time a new chair is produced and an old one isn't broken, then the supply of chairs has been inflated.

A “simple” block size change can’t even find a consensus good luck with any change that will radically alter or put profitability of miners at stake.  The problem is bitcoin is already centralized, and so changes are impossible to push through without the mining cartel forking away.

I would argue that if announcing you have 40k usd in bitcoin is somehow dangerous (i dont think it is) that it's an indictment on bitcoin itself.
If I announced i had 40k usd in the bank; 1. no one gives a shit, 2. even if someone put a gun to my head when I woke up in the morning they wouldn't be able to get it. 3. if by some miracle they were able to make such a transfer, the banking system has measures to recover it.

Liquidity in trading terms is the cost to buy or sell immediately.  The best way I can explain it without going into too much jargon is think of your big box retailer like Target as your traditional market maker and HFT as Amazon.  Amazon is constantly adjusting and changing their prices based on demand real time, but you wouldn't buy from them unless they had the best price available right?  Amazon typically has some of the lowest prices and they make their money from doing volume.  HFTs are similar in that they adjust to supply and demand but their margins are very low (often times fractional pennies per trade) but at high volume.  That's why HFTs can offer the best prices and people are willing to trade with them.  Ultimately the sale/trade goes to the person who offers the best price and nobody is forced to trade at a price that they don't want.
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:08:41
Please, I work in HFT, and most HFT firms are not in the bitcoin space, it's definitely an idea, but the market cap and volume of BTC isnt enough to make shit for it to be worth the effort (at the moment) to build to.  This is not even factoring in the instability of exchanges, fractured markets, and clearing/acctg.
I can be certain though that many people who work in HFT and Algo trading have probably on their own volition for fun/profit built algos at home for trading.  
Also just to break any misconceptions people have of HFT, for the most part algo and HFT activity is liquidity providing and a positive for most markets.
EDIT: This guy also claims to be an HFT trader/quant/dev at a bank,  if there are any firms that are in the BTC space it would be at a proprietary trading firm (think GETCO, Jane St), but most likely much smaller leaner firms.  A bank prop/hft desk would find it difficult to even be allowed to trade at a BTC exchange given the regulatory environment banks are currently facing.
