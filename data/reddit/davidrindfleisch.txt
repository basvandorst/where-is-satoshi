And also within that time less than a week after i cashed out my simple ira the market hit its first ever double /  triple loss.. Feel triple digits two days in a row! So it was perfect timing :) If i didnt take out the money in my simple IRA it would have been cut in half! Thanks Bitcoin And BitcoinRyan for pushing me to it and helping me help myself!

Very cool to think that when i started bitcoin 8-1-15 about a month after the price dropped to 220.00 then shortly rebounded to 500.00 and within that tim i got to empty my Simple IRA and get a good amount of bitcoin for around 300.00 .. I never seen money grow so fast.. 300.00 to 500.00 really quick.. Needless to say i am know hooked to bitcoin for life. I love it so much!

LOL  I hear you , but bitcoin being the way it is people/govements can regulate it any way they want... hopefully you are lucky enough to be in a place where you can still freely exchange or pay bitcoin without a third party ..blockchain is the records .. but chances are those are places that do not have a system in place already.. Systems in place will fit it in however they feel fit.. So basic law of the land your in applies.. if the only way that people can use it is threw one of them service and they want or need the bitcoin bad enough to pay them fees then that's their free right to put that tax in that service and if bitcoin is Free to anyone anyway without the need for these third parties know matter who you are you can use those bitcoins and tax them anyway you want if the laws make it so.. the Worlds problem with everything.  The double edged blade... I know one thing for sure .. Never ever will everyone in this world will be happy or agree with how thing work or how they should work..
