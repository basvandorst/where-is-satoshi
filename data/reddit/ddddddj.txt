Well apart from the clinical experience and interpersonal skills you build during your time you only really get the foundation of science which underlies all procedures they do.

I personally don't. Others do. His sex is a man but if he wants to be called a woman I'm not the type of person to get hung up about a word. You clearly care more about her than I do.

No, I never implied that. I was just pointing out your flawed logic.

Even if your murder rate had a 52% reduction to account for the bad apple cities it would **still be higher than the UK**. Hell it'd still be higher than the murder rate of Sierra Leone or Malawai or Ghana or Jordan hahahaha LMAO

You already contradicted your first comment. So only liberal arts degress indoctrinate, not all colleges? Also the indoctrination only happens to a certain number of people because otherwise it doesn't explain people with conservative beliefs studying liberal arts degrees.

Your argument is flawed, you know it. Give up lmao
Also define "lot longer"

Not every liberal agreen with the distinction between gender and sex but distinction doesn't sound like something you're capable of.
Also where the fuck did you pull the anti white shit from?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:00:33
Yes her gender, not her sex. It's just becoming a social norm to accept the distinction between the two.
Just like how it is now a social norm for people to be gay but it sure as fuck wasn't considered normal back in the 60s. Society changes with time, that's just a fact. 
If changing or refusing to change a pronoun is the most important aspect of politics to you then so be it but there's obviously things more important to society than whether some random person is a he or a she.

Do you live everyday of your life trying to be scientifically accurate? We don't need to be in social situations because language is not a science. Stop trying to make it into one. 
Say one of your male family members decides they want to be a woman (fuck knows why don't ask me). They ask that when you do have to call them a he or she that you call them she. I'm not one to get flustered about words so I'll just call them whichever one is polite and gets the job done. You'll claim the left cares so much about words and are snowflakes when it comes to certain words but you lot get your knickers in a twist when you have to hypothetically call a guy a she - chances are you won't actually have to do this in your life time.

He likely created the account new to post this because he didn't want to give away his reddit username to a friend or something.

I have an unknown amount in my BTER account that I no longer have the Google Authenticator linked up to.

His point is that without a college degree you couldn't become one.

USA 92nd, UK 176th. USA has more homicides per capita than any other European country. Keep lying to yourself mate and try not to get shot on in school, or airport, or concert, or club, or by police.

And you continue to demonstrate your lack of reading comprehension by not understanding this. I study science, why would I be anti science?


When did I make a racist remark? If you want to know my opinion on creationism I think people have the right to believe in what they want.


Projection. You are unhinged. Your days are spent on multiple reddit accounts wasting time shit posting about Trump and trolling. Do something productive with your time man.


Lmao I'm not American and I'm glad. Your country is divided and half of it is retarded or in denial (including some of the left imo). America is sinking with a manchild at it's helm.

@_date: 2017-11-29 23:58:57
Yeah I am so scared to go outside of my house because of all the hordes you read about in Breitbart. I am much safer where I live than anywhere in America and that's a fact.

You've probably never read a single paper. If you can't make the distinction between physical and social sciences then no wonder you voted Trump.
Also every time I've tried to have a conversation with someone supporting Trump they've never manage to talk about something seriously for long because god forbid someone question their thinking. Funny that. You managed to ignore the rest of the post and reply with something useless.

Have you been to university? The learning experience is very different between a MOOC compared to the skills you build during group work, labs, coursework and the preperation for exams. You're also surrounded by people that are usually interested in the same subject as you. 
MOOCs are good for just gaining the knowledge but not much else.

Gender is not scientific, sex is. Why does gender need to be a science? We already have a scientific method of determining whether someone is male or female - sex.   Sex is an absolute science and is determined by genitalia so who gives a flying fuck when someone identifies a different gender. Call them whatever the hell they wanna be called and move on with your day. It really isn't a big issue.
If they claim they are sexually a female when they are a male then of course they would be wrong but if they just want to be called a she instead of he then I'd do the polite thing. Think of it as a name.

That's weird considering how almost all degrees boost lifetime earnings by significant amounts.
