OpenBazaar was released on April 4, less than 4 months ago. Do you expect more from such a young marketplace? You're not providing a benchmark for comparison to substantiate your sarcastic comment.

OpenBazaar has several decentralised components and the value is in the integration.
Right now:
* decentralised DNS-like system (converting GUIDs to IPs via a [DHT] (
* decentralised ID system (converting handles to GUIDs via Bitcoin-based [BlockchainID](
* decentralised end-to-end encrypted chat (with standard crypto and the ID system)
* decentralised payments (using Bitcoin)
* decentralised market of moderators (based on 2-of-3 multisig and ID reputation)
* decentralised search (by storing tag-to-listing mappings in the DHT)
* decentralised reputation (based on ratings and followers)
In the future:
* distributed store hosting (with [IPFS](
* decentralised anonymisation (with Tor)
* better decentralised search and reputation

Yes, the network allows it. There are several ways to break down an address into many inputs. 1) Top-up in small increments. 2) Make a "dummy" self-transaction to break down a large input. 3) Reuse change and spend unconfirmed transactions.

Comments on rev 5:
* I found another running text instance. See page 3 [here](
* Replace the two instances of "well-known" with "well known".
* Your serial commas are still not consistent. I guess that's a nitpick.


For consistency, replace "symbol" with "sign"


Be consistent about the hyphen in "well-defined".




This reads funny, because the Bitcoin sign is not even in Unicode yet.


"No reasons come to mind" is subjective. What about "Like other currency symbols, the Bitcoin sign should not be part of a collating sequence, or have a particular collation order."?


Remove "multiple".

Replace the first 'and' with a comma.


Remove the trailing slash.


Remove "amazingly". Too subjective.


The use of "I" is weak. Prefer a more factual wording such as "As checked with bitcoin.org, the logo is in the public domain."


Same as above. Reword without the subjective "I".


I would be specific about which version of the browsers where used. Maybe write "as rendered in the latest versions of".


The "at all" reads defensively. I would remove it.


The source only presents Ƀ as a hack.


Remove "then".


Remove "even", which is defensive.


"common" is in the wrong place: "The Bitcoin sign is a common component of Bitcoin logos"


Roman capital letters?


This reference [27] inconsistently comes before the dot.


Why 20BF specifically? Is it the first available spot? Expand on this.


Add "and" before "Portuguese".
* The descriptions for Figures 19 and 20 are in italics (but the others are not). Also remove italics for Table 1.
* I would make the three subheadings "Name", "Range" and "Collation" stand out more (e.g. make them bold).
* The text inconsistently uses the [serial comma]( The second sentence in the abstract, for example, is missing it.
* Add borders to Figure 21, similar to figures 1-20.
* I would replace the four instances of "doesn't" and "isn't" with "does not" and "is not", to keep things in a formal voice.
* I would centre Table 1 for aesthetic reasons.
* What is a "collation sequence" and a "collation order"?

Eris has not put forward a single convincing prototype (yes, I've seen the YouTube prototype) or thought experiment that shows the idea of blockchain-without-cryptocurrency provides any value from a consensus point of view. The primary voice of the company, you Preston, has an extremely high noise to content ratio in your talk. Eris clearly has some great programmers, and you're doing them a huge disservice by being in charge of PR.
P.S. The marmot and Dogecoin sarcasm is past its due date. Once funny, twice boring, thrice totally unprofessional and inappropriate.

Then another three days, no payment, no email, nothing. I finally get him on the line, and within a couple hours the payment is sent.
He basically sat 6 days with my money in total silence, with a bunch of missed calls and ignored emails from me.

Comments on rev 9:


Double dot


The Bitcoin Foundation is a Bitcoin organizations. Consider rephrasing. Also, I question if the Bitcoin Foundation (don't be fooled by the name!) is worth emphasizing in the intro.


If you write "bitcoins" in plural, then it's the currency *units*, not the currency (which is "bitcoin", singular).


Because Wired is not part of the Bitcoin community, I would put this example higher up.


Remove 'in 2011'. You don't have the year for other examples.


Capital B for Bitonic


This sentence is lacking a verb. What about, "The proposed code point is 20BF, the next available code point in the range Currency Symbols (20A0–20CF)."


No dash.


For consistency with the other projects listed, but the project name (Ethereum).


Remove 'just'


Double dot


Remove "transient". All fads are transient.


Mobile apps use the bitcoin sign


This sentence is written as if you're sharing your opinion. Just write "It is unlikely that Bitcoin will suddenly disappear."


"it does not resemble" reads more professional


Remove 'existing'. In the previous sentence you use it for 'existing Unicode character'.


For consistency, replace 'bitcoin symbol' by 'bitcoin sign'.


Remove the 'of'. Rewrite as 'to be “hijacking” or “stealing” the baht symbol.'


Not all pesos ([example here]( use $. Be more specific 'e.g. $ for US dollars and Mexican pesos'
* I think it is worth including that the 250-glyph set Glyphicon included in the popular Bootstrap framework has the Bitcoin sign (glyphicon-bitcoin).
* Building upon the previous comment, there may be uses of the Bitcoin sign in running text in [this search result](
* I dislike the footer "Proposal for addition of Bitcoin sign, page X of 14". I prefer the shorter "X of 14".
* In Figure 26, can you box each of the 6 renderings individually, so they can be visually separated?
* I agree that the sign stands out from other currencies because of the B's large size. Can you make it a pixel or two smaller?
* In the acknowledgments, would you mind putting my name "Justin Drake" instead of bobthesponge1?

I'm well-versed in Eris's writings on the website; I've seen you speak, I've seen your videos, and I've listened to the Let's Talk Bitcoin! episode. I'm probably one of your top-10 followers.
So you have a paying customer. So what? Good for you! I bet you've been commissioned for some sort of internal corporate software, completely devoid of non-traditional consensus, where the use of "blockchains" is a joke.
Bring forward a single consensus breakthrough that isn't doable on Ethereum. My claim is that Eris is not part of the consensus revolution brought by Bitcoin and generalised by Ethereum. You repeatedly claim the contrary, but avoid proving it, with statements like "go figure it yourself".
Edit: Removed swear words, and comment about marmots.

Good effort! A few comments:


I would write "the underlying currency" instead of "this currency", since "payment system" != "currency". 


I recommend adding a citation for this.


I would make explicit the fact that Bitcoin is the first ever cryptocurrency.


This statement sounds a bit defensive. I would remove "very".


I would add [the symbol for Ether]( Ξ, simply because it is the [fourth largest cryptocurrrency]( by market cap. Maybe a citation for each cryptocurrency would be a good idea.


This is the only place "it is" is contracted to "it's", which I find too informal in this context.


"completes" is an ambitious verb here. Maybe "appends to" or "adds to" is better.


What is "the SMP"?
* Maybe add a note that the author has already authored a successful Unicode proposal.
* The citation brackets at the end of sentences are inconsistently handled. Sometimes they have a prepending space, sometimes not.
* I think the Wikipedia uses (Figures 12 and 13) are really strong points, and would put them higher up.
* At first glance, it is unclear that Figure 4 is a collage of 5 different screenshots. I would separate the different parts somehow.

For retail payments, Bitcoin – 'dumb' electronic cash – can be augmented with services traditionally served by the card industry, namely:
* Escrow and customer protection
* Currency exchange
* Convenience and security (e.g. ApplePay)
* Liquidity provision (e.g. credit card loans)
* Loyalty programs (e.g. Amex points)
* Insurance programs (e.g. Amex travel insurance)
There are many opportunities for collaboration with legacy financial players.

Andreas just smashed one of the most common criticism of Bitcoin, "no customer protection". It turns out transaction reversibility can be reproduced on top of Bitcoin's solid foundations, using 2-of-3 multisig and nlocktime.
I expect it will take at least a couple years, though, for a market of arbitrators to flourish, and for merchants to accept these more complex transaction types.
