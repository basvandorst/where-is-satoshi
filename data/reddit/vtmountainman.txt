If you look at my posts I'm extremely critical of customer service.. I've been working with bitpay for awhile and just the other day had a problem with usd showing up as Btc and then being sent to my wallet..
They solves it within 48hrs and was by far the best service I've received from any bitcoin business.. My .02

i almost bought stickers for my paperwallets from you today, until i saw this blatant rip off of other developers hard work to earn yourself profit.  Now not so much will i ever give you business.

just got done speaking with a senior trader at fidelity.. this article is bullshit as of now..  there are no ETF's at fidelity for bitcoin(doesn't mean there won't be)
@_date: 2013-11-01 10:47:51
i just had an order cancelled magically after I've made SEVERAL purchases from them no problem.. they said its because i have multiple accounts but it NEVER AFFECTED MY PURCHASES before.. something super scummy is going on here.. Their Bid/Ask spread has increased significantly lately.. Buying for a much higher rate than they're selling for.  
Stay away from coinbase until they have answers.  I'm done with them, going with localbitcoins only from now on.
@_date: 2013-12-12 04:37:55
that's why i said the article is b.s...  i'm aware of the rules to the fund.  nothing has changed, and fidelity said the article was basically bullshit.

coinbase is a joke of a company and selectively scams their customers and has terrible customer support(going on two months with no response).. here let me help you out.

I sold my stock in NEO &amp; Bee because of TAT's shitty customer service and forcing investors to use havelock investments..  and also refusing to allow us to transfer off without paying him when the time comes for direct shares.. Really disappointed but i refuse to be involved in an investment with such a scumbag for leadership.  His general lack of compassion for people who put money in his hands is pathetic.  Ignores emails for weeks, etc.

DOING IT RIGHT NOW.. I have 8k in my IRA wondering what to do with it.. whats the ticker?
@_date: 2013-11-02 12:51:33
actually yes, they did steal from me.. they used my bank account to purchase coins at one price.. when it came time to give them to me they refused, stopped answering e-mails, and ran off with the coins.. sure they gave my money back, but they did so at a profit of nearly 100%.. kind of fucking gay.. so you FUCK OFF
They offered to "whitelist" me but didn't offer to give me my coins back at the price i agreed to pay them.. so yea they did steal from me as far as i'm concerned you bloody fucking douche nozzle
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:49:14
that sounds retarded.. no offense.. i buy and dont bother with the price.. there isn't a single bitcoin purchase I regret.. have been buying $100 every two weeks since $10...

coinbase is a pile of shit.. bitcoin will FAIL if exchanges don't get their shit together and the number of scams is just pathetic.. the bitcoin community is a fucking disease.
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:16:53
this is why bitcoin will fail.. the most prominent exchange in the world, sucks giant cocks..

incase you people haven't figured it out, the only reason for wars anymore is to open new markets.. they go into these countries, westernize them so they have new places to build malls of america and sell cheap plastic chinese shit.
@_date: 2013-11-07 17:50:33
They refused and told me all they could do is "white list " me even though I am level 2 verified and had made at least 5 purchases in the past including several instant.. They're straight scamming.. Using our funds to buy, when price rocketed up, refunded, kept coins, sold or free profit... Straight scam.. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:28:56
coinbase is far from the best thing to happen to bitcoin... in fact they're stealing coins from customers on a daily basis...  
@_date: 2013-12-06 11:53:46
that's funny you say that.. the average american breaks 5 federal laws every single day.. without knowing.. that's how fucked up our legal system is.

please point out my false assumption?
When was the last time Mt Gox paid out USD withdrawal?
Coinbase canceling users orders and delaying cash outs to reap the benefits of the increasing price
btc-e well.. they're russians, and are selectively scamming USD depositors.
tat "investments"
TradeFortress and inputs.io, coinabul, and on and on.
the list goes on and on.. these are suppose to be the most trustworthy sites we have and we can't trust one as far as we can throw them.  So please inform me how i'm making "false assumptions"

they obviously don't know conbase that well.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:50:30
lol not surprised.. bitcoin is a giant scam.. every exchange selectively scams its customers and they are suppose to be the must trust worthy of trustworthy sites.. You expect some drug addicts with 43 million dollars in their possession to NOT scam? LOL...
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:04:00
It's to bad you're using such a shitty person as tat to manage shares.. Doesn't give a shit about your investors.. Only getting his "transfer" fee...

Edit:  On the phone with fidelity now will update soon on what I find out as that marketwatch article sucks.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:40:10
this is the second hack in as many weeks.  I think it's time the bitcoin community bail on theymos.. He's stolen enough bitcoin for a lifetime.. Fuck that guy.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:57:17
and yet another example of the serpent eating its tail.. Every exchange is as crooked as it gets.. Every exchange is run by a bunch of crooks.. This is crazy.. This will be bitcoins downfall.. When an exchange runs off with every day betties it will be the end of their bitcoin experience. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 13:32:58
Ignore this guy, it will take you over 2-4 weeks to get a response..
 is your best bet.. don't give those crooks the time of day.. Bought at $180 after about 20 successful purchases was marked as high risk when the price shot to the moon, still waiting on a response.  Everyone says they'll honor it, but it's bullshit.. They selectively scam.. i even contact olaf on bitcointalk.. 3 weeks ago.. no response.

Scam base.. Bought two weeks ago at $180.. Cancelled fun these crooks.. Bought coin with our money, price goes up, refund, sell, profit..
Some coinbase Schiller called me a liar and down voted till it fell off the page... 
@_date: 2013-11-04 20:38:57
They'll also cancel your order when bitcoin price rises and say that you triggered their "fraud warnings". They'll keep your coins you purchased..  They a least refund at a tidy free profit since they paid much less and "white list you" so it never happens again.. It's all bullshit.. Coinbase is a bunch of crooks.. Still wont respond to me about how to delete my credit car information from their site.. A week later..  
This thread will get downvotes until it falls off by the coinbase shills... Every negative coinbase thread magically falls off...
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:34:22
I have tried to do plenty... I've been involved with bitcoin since the beginning, i own quite a lot of coin.. I'm trying to improve the community and inform them when a site has taken advantage of people.. I'm pissed off because of the responses I have gotten when bringing things to light.  To the point i'm ready to cash out and call it a day.  take my 100k and go home.
@_date: 2013-12-02 11:35:01
one bad apple.. and this my friend is a perfect example of the serpent eating its own tail.  If the leader of the most prominent forum on bitcoin can't be expected to keep his end of deals, how can any new comer trust anything anyone says?  Smoke and Mirrors.  I'm all for the discussion of bitcoin, in fact i do it all the time.  What I won't do is do it on a site that earns theymos many more hundreds thousands of dollars if not millions in advertisements.  I can not conciously support a theif of theymos' level and tell my friends that bitcointalk is a safe place to learn about bitcoin.  As the chances they will get scammed are great.  Especially when Theymos scammed the entire community and only a small handful seem to care about the missing 6 million dollars he did nothing with.
I'm so confused how a group of humans can be som complacent.  Not only that he allowed BFL to continue to advertise on his site out of pure greed when he knew that they were ripping off their customers.  I can't support that, no matter how good the content is.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:18:13
My problem isn't with charging fees.. It's when he wants me to pay a fee to go to direct shares when I never wanted to be on havelock in the firt place.. Nd especially when it was bought out by some random Panamanian company or whatever... I was forced there when we were moved from btct...  We should have been honored with a free transfer to direct shares but his brash and rude emails time after over a month of silence was enough for me to sake my shares.. Guys a douche

you're joking right?  Themos is one of the biggest thieves in the bitcoin community... I wouldn't give his forum the time of day.. he has over 6 million dollars worth of bitcoin that he collected to make changes to bitcointalk forum YEARS ago.. and never did.. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:00:28
little evidence?  The proof is in the pudding kid.  Has Bitcointalk been upgraded since thermos took 6000 BTC out of the community in "donations" for said upgrades?  No?  Then he's a liar, a thief, and a scumbag.  The clueless part comes from clear evidence that his site has been hacked twice in as many months.
