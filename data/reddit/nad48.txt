I thought the problem here was Web pages that can be made to appear different with a man in the middle attack and certification authorities cannot be trusted if under a state level attack. 
A transaction with a hash value can be known to come from someone  or if not maybe signed instead by that someone. A few days ago Snowden sent a tweet in what some (debatable) said it could be to verify a file or whatever (just an example) using bitcoin immutability to prevent mitm. 
If the final objective is let someone know that he has downloaded a malign wallet we cannot do anything to contact him but maybe ask people to verify the hashes of whatever software they download. Now if we are dealing with a state level attacker with many vectors of attacks like modifying CA and even firewalling and displaying to their own citizens a whole "false Internet" or false bitcoin resources if they want? How can you ultimately find an immutable place to post the real hash? why not in bitcoin network with a signed message from a core developer?
Regarding some comments about not trusting that centalization post, other  publishers sign their software in that or other way.
Regarding your "you have not solved the problem" I know I haven't solved anything. I know you guys dislike people giving """"solutions"""" but this reddit, not github (by the way i have a few decades of soft engineering) it was just a quick thought but I guess it ended in the pile of the billion of uninformed revolutionary ideas you read everyday my apologies for that.

Beware reader. There is something in this world called operation chokepoint that might have or not something to do with bitcoin, who knows. We have had many exchanges hacked, that is totally true. 
People should be very careful of the amount they have in the exchanges, if it is way too much for what they can afford to lose, that is another truth. Maybe using multiple exchanges to reduce risk? Maybe considering (also another risk) using some leverage to reduce the amount in the exchange? Maybe leaving the exchange when the market is clearly moving up or sideways? No clue really. 
Everyone should do their own diligence but the recommendation to avoid using exchanges could bring bitcoin to a very long cold winter, with no liquidity at all, with huge volatility. With some exchanges closing due lack of fees. Speculator market leaving with their money ofc, (a lot of money by the way) and reducing bitcoin market cap, big investors that cannot enter the tiny market, etc. So be careful what you wish for. Not sure how this has to be addressed, maybe more and more security, back to cold wallets and proof of reserve, more p2p exchanges on the exchange side and reduction of risk on the trader side as much as possible but it is a problem that crypto industry has to solve and if it does not solve it, just hiding the head under the sand and saying, we don't want trading AT ALL could be very very bad for bitcoin. Can you imagine a gold market where people cannot buy gold? do we really want to have something that cannot be bought, traded at all? 
Be careful because some people (the usual attackers we have around every day and that just change their strategy every few months) might be trying here a financial chokepoint on bitcoin, same as they have with all the uncomfortable industries lately. Check here the victim industries 
Hell, with some dirty/lateral thinking maybe there are even some parties interested on some exchanges hacked to hurt as much as possible. "Bitcoin is not secure", "Another MtGox", "Bitcoin is full of thiefs" all over the press. You can bet some people love it. We all read and have been reading the press on bitcoin for years. Didn't karpeles post some mails from some agents blackmailing him? Silk road the same? Bitfinex being required to remove cold storage? Maybe this is just bullshit. I cannot tell i am just another peasent with no info, who knows. I have the ridiculous habit of considering different points of view, even non standard.
Anyway, my opinion is that Bitcoin trading is risky and that risk should be managed with multiple exchanges, leverage, getting coins out, p2p exchanges, etc but i don't think the solution is to kill speculation and just hold an asset that cannot be traded and is illiquid because we have fear. The industry has to solve this issue or we really have a huge problem. Crypto industry is very far from being able to feed itself. The more bridges and water pumps we build with the old economy the better. If the industry closes all those bridges (and not even counting the bridges "they" are closing or adding more and more control) then we will have a problem.
This post won't be appreciated so probably will be downvoted as usual.

It is not conspiracy. It is bandwidth throttling. One guy watching a video on YouTube consumes as much bandwidth as 100 watching webs. If you are all the day watching videos you can have lag and video interruptions (depending on the ISP). it could be temporary or a routing priority coniguration in your isp or whatever. Some isps  route or prioritize network packets with some headers etc.   
That is another reason for a vpn. If they don't know what is your connection doing, they cannot throttle you.   
For example in my own computer with vpn I can be hours watching HD videos without the slightest problem and many windows at the same time.   
 In my wife's computer without vpn after she has been watching videos for some time she starts to get lag and interruptions.
If you use vpn their deep packet inspection techniques and their network shaping simply does not work.
"...Today most if not all Internet Service Providers throttle their users' bandwidth, with or without the user ever even realizing it...."

This has to do with the elasticity of supply/demand.
    Will bitcoin be more elastic or more inelastic than last halving where the supply reduced drastically.
   Elasticity has some relation with the existence or not of alternatives to reduce the impact of a sudden supply reduction. But is there any real alternative to an asset that for many it's principal characteristic is its value apreciación?
    I mean, if there is a reduction of supply in apples people eat other fruits. But if there is a reduction of supply precisely in an asset that many appreciate by its fast apreciation rate or just store against external depreciation for others, is there really an alternative? Specially if it starts to skyrocket? 
  I am not even close to know about this issue so i will appreciate any thought on this
@_date: 2016-04-12 12:06:25
The irony is that bitcoin image has been very carefully attacked by the media corporations they own. They just want to keep being free pharaohs for a few hundred more years (forever?)

Well they could do if my total bandwidth reached outrageous amounts with vpn but that is not the case.

Be careful posting your details. There might be people that uses them against you. I would recommend this to anyone but in your specific case might be even more necessary.     
Are you using vpn so they have less info about your network habits and the don't throttle your connection?. For example I can watch HD videos on YouTube without any problem using vpn but when I switch the vpn off the video starts to lag after some time as the isp does not like so much one guy watching a video compared to the same bandwidth for a hundred watching webs. Although I have fiber they encourage or prioritize some packets it seems.

I have trezor and ledger. During installation ledger assumes that your computer is not compromised and that does seem as a vulnerability that trezor does not have.     
[The reason of hw wallet should be total security and I think ledger should not even allow installation under Windows 10 and it's pervasive keylogging]
   
Ledger is cheaper and I think one of the creators made a video showing how it it water proof.     
Ledger also requires an additional code card credit card size that is not needed on trezor.  My trezor USB cable failed after some time. I replaced it with one of the millions I have from old phones. Both servers have failed to me in very bad moments so now I use them with mycelium or electrum. 
    
I like both. Consider that I am not deeply informed about every detail on this although I am subscribed to both ledger and trezor subreddits and try to follow up so do your own research.

Well I respect your decision but I think the conclusions you get are not entirely correct. I participate in many subreddits with different themes from games to politics to mobiles, etc.   
 There are people from very different places and different opinions but they all have something in common: they have an arrow up or down that they can press in half a second.    
If your comment or conclusion seems too emotive, incorrect or unfair they will press the downvote. It can be in Peppa pig channel, android or apple.    
Some have more emotional responses probably related with involvement with the specific theme.
In my humble opinion your conclusion was incorrect and quite unfair and dismissive of the whole technology without enough research or insight and your wording appeared as quite emotive or maybe passive agressive and so some people felt inclined to downvote you.  
Why unfair? because this guy made some serious security mistakes. Read other detailed answers for more info.    
Why dismissive without enough research? because many people have been using this for years without losing anything and the conclusion is indeed incorrect. There are hardware devices like ledger or trezor that remove the security problem and allow you to use securely your bitcoins even in a totally controlled with a hundred Trojans and viruses because the signature is performed in the external hardware device and not in the pc. A ledger costs 40$ maybe. There are many other possibilities aswell.
Why passive agressive? Because while some people try to solve problems, participate create share and build with a smile you just complained about something not working without any involvement.   
  
You have all the rights in this world to behave like this but some people feel inclined to downvote. It would have happened in a drone or photography  subreddit should you have said the same.      
Anyway nice to talk to you and hope to see you in other subreddit you find more enjoyable  ; )

thanks for your reply. i just hope that as some projects are being worked on to address smart contracts and reputation systems to allow trustless interactions, the same is being considered on the development side to combat possible governance vulnerabilities, social and media engineering to game the system. As it is nomally said, a chain is only as strong as the weakest of its links. This surely can be applied aswell to blockchains and the only reason to be of bitcoin blockchain is if it is trustless enough and appears to be so to its users. if that is not the case we might be better on the hands of more centralized versions backed by other traditional methods like "force". i just hope aswell that a governance weakness does not build the case for those more centralized approaches. probably won't take long before companies like oracle, ibm or sap start releasing hybrids blockchain-database and the only force bitcoin will have against highly funded corporations is how decentralized, pure and exemplary it is at non being subject to any coercion where they will be severely lacking.

this is not looking good at all. seems the discord tactics by who knows whom are working wonderfully. 
   
A decentralized project with centralized management is centralized and vulnerable. and with the actual methods it seems a decentralized project with decentralized management is a headless chicken. seems satoshi's model was not complete after all and a governance model is needed
   
As a database expert myself i think we have to avoid trying to compete with databases on storage, or speed as it is a lost cause. i think the main characteristic of bitcoin is its trustless nature not subject to coercion, and we need a blockchain that only stores a cryptographically trustless prunable transaction log that can be checkpointed and decentralized to infinity thanks to small size, and adding to that parallel nodes that use actual database technology for speed, scalability, storage but maintaining a cryptographic nexus with the trustless "transactiion log" ledger. we simply cannot compete with databases with a handicap of 30 years behind timeframe and duplicating everything everywhere. we need to realize what is a blockchain and insist on its qualities not trying to reinvent the wheel.

the problem is not anymore the block size. the real problem decided here is bicoin governance. how are Xt decisions going to be taken?  are hearn's redlists coming next, even if like here a major amount of developers decide the opposite? will a populist fear mongering media campaign will be enough to control governance? then bitcoin has already lost because it was only decentralized on design but centralized on governance. if this happens, bitcoin will end like liberty reserve or halcash. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 18:10:40
the block size is an important issue but it is even more important the bitcoin governance approach? why not a bip for this proposal?  if we fork to xt, how is bitcoin governance going to work? will hearn's redlists come next even again against other developer proposals? 
   
if we hard fork against the decission and the will of many developers that have spent so many hours developing in the project, has anyone considered the implications?  will this seriously demotivate half of them?  what if we just lose half of the bitcoin developers because their ideas are not even considered after so much work?  
    
in the end, is a technically decentralized software project enough to survive coercion or will just some fear and some reddit downvotes lead us to a centralized vulnerable and easily coercible governance model of just a few that cannot even follow the previously agreed procedure for bips? will this centralized system die like hascash, liberty reserve, etc?

why not incentivize with some money from fees? . now that all mining is based on asics, why not get more people participating on bitcoin and enriching the network giving them some fees?   didn't Gavin create a faucet the first years to get more people trying bitcoin?  i think mining was at some point and publishing nodes could be the bitcoin killer app.  
how many times "bitcoin mining" appears in google trends by newcomers that just get discouraged as those times are past?

Is Bitcoin Welcoming to Women? You can bet your life that it will be very soon. A huge worldwide machinary is moving to let a big percent of the technical jobs move into women hands using no technical knowledge reasons but just women empowering ideas.  
  
First they find the "nerd" as the total opposite of the "alpha male", making the nerds one step below rats in their scale. But come on, after the nerds find "money", they want in too!! Hey it is not fair, they want UNWomen empowering efforts (and huge funds) to get their share here too!!.  
  
Hey we males deserve it, we have been so bad in past generations that they want their turn. When the soviets entered germany during the final stages  of WWII, they also wanted revenge and they lined up the innocent german civils on the floor and smashed them with their tanks. They so deserved it!!     
  
The feminist organizations tanks are already going over our and our male children's civil rights no matter what and women feel they have the right to do it although we western world males (with the lowest rate of sexism in history) are as innocent as victim women were 100 years ago.   
   
(Note: 99.99999% of women are awesome, i am just talking about the other feminazi percent that rule the feminist game for personal gain and national/worldwide organizations that not having male counterparty organizations are following their agenda with huge disproportion). A kiss from here to the many wonderful women i love and share my idea of an equality well done.

It is p2p, anonymous if needed, it has chat, forums, a way to vote links like reddit, an internal chat system,  any plug in can be created if needed.

"If banks do not make significant progress soon, regulators should consider actively pushing for, or even perhaps mandating, improvements," 
He compared banks' approach to former movie rental giant Blockbuster, which went bankrupt after it failed to innovate and was disintermediated by companies like Netflix.
"The current market failure in the payments system is, in part, why there has been so much excitement about virtual currency technology," Lawksy said. "Virtual currency could have the potential to force the existing, legacy payments system to up its game in a significant way."

Thanks for your post.
I had some brainwallets before but were easier. I had them on my mind and could remember them without any problem at all.
But this one i think it was the longest one, i was just too convinced that i knew it so i did not refresh it on my mind every few days or weeks.
One day i just tried to sweep it using blockchain.info. At that time you could just enter passphrases directly into the import area (not anymore) and none of the passphrases i kept entering showed any amount of bitcoins although my address was there and the money was there, and i know the address is correct because i can follow up myself sending the bitcoins to that "exact" address.
I panicked and tried some more, then after one day and feeling pretty bad i tried the "prototype" i mentioned, just sending keystrokes to the web page but was too slow. Later i switched directly to javascript with the same local modified brainwallet.org page. And still no luck.
I have tried to remember that day, analyzed every file in my computer for that date, my calendar and any available info like newspapers, etc to try to locate my mind in that time period.
The problem i think is that the connections through neurons (anyone correct me please if what i say does not make much sense) it like the "feromons?" for ants, the more ants going in an area, the stronger the path gets. If you just keep trying and trying different combinations, it might happen that similar combinations in your own brain trying and trying to remember the exact one, replace the "real" one (or have more weight/importance). At this moment my brain in the memory zone where my passphrase is stored is like a dance zone in a disco, i have walked and walked and danced and danced all over the area and the first real "footprints" are just covered by my thousands of unsuccesful tries. I don't know anymore and instead of going forward with the possibilities i have more and more doubts like "what if i added this at the end?" or "why not try this?". That just adds and adds millions and more millions of combinations.
Cheers ;-) 
Lol i just hope i don't end with some kind of brain cancer or stupid brain problem obsessing myself with this.
Actually i think it could probably be an interesting study area for mental doctors. I am sure there are not many recorded cases for obsessive "doubt" on brains like this one before brainwallets. Even people 50 years ago probably could go to some technician and open manually a safe-deposit. So this leaves me in the same position as if the pirate "blackbeard" did forget about the treasure location :D

I think they accept Bitcoin already 
The problem is that they are quite expensive and they are located on the US so you will never know if they add a backdoor (they can't tell you)
(With all my respect for the US IT industry of course, but i just don't like those spy backdoors)
Another option is wuala on switzerland, everything encrypted but pretty expensive.

So do you really believe in Spain they are going to use Spaincoin. It is like distributing a coin with a Spanish name eg  Monedainglesa  in the UK. Ridiculous. That is just a pump and dump. 
And by the way any citizen that gives their national identity number to some shady group for an absurd amount of less than a cent of an euro is just stupid. Also how are you going to collect the identities. Are you going to follow the Spanish protection data law or the European privacy laws? . If not the fine is going to be awesome.

Some pearls:
Tom Robinson, director of the UK Digital Currency Association, said: “We are seeing growing interest from institutions, especially hedge funds. We’ve had interest from some investment banks in Europe as well.”
Coinfloor, Bitstamp and Elliptic are part of a wave of UK start-ups aiming to turn London into the centre of the emerging Bitcoin industry, spurred by the collapse of MtGox earlier this year.
“The bankruptcy of MtGox was an event that is often seen by the public and investors as a pretty negative event for Bitcoin; but for most entrepreneurs, we’re seeing it as an incredible opportunity in the space.”

In my country HUNDREDS of normal citizens have killed themselves 5 minutes before being evicted from their homes by the police. Millions are suffering none or heavily reduced social services and health care after the last financial game. Millions work many more hours with less payment and in very bad working conditions, 14 days working in a row, many hours, less rights. 
BILLIONS around the world are suffering the consequences of financial risk games and it is going to repeat again now on 2014. 
We are suffering a resource financial Holocaust where there is only one or two Childs on my extended family when in past generations we were dozens of cousins and brothers and we cannot even pay the bills with one son. 
Meanwhile JPMorgan ceo sends Christmas cards everywhere playing tennis inside his own house and breaking everything for fun while being fined billions every month. 
I feel the same remorse about this guy as they feel about us during their financial games. 
The psychiatrist taking care of some of the nazi prisoners after nuremberg said that they were perfectly normal people but they had a total lack of empathy. 
Financial terrorists show the same lack of empathy for the rest of the planet. They bet on Mexican severed heads, on the air we breathe on the trees and the planet itself using derivatives and naked sorts.

The point is in the first sentence "Somewhere in December 2013, a number of traders including myself began noticing suspicious bot behavior on Mt. Gox.". You have to be a regular of Tradingview.com to see the fanaticism of the bears (and the bulls aswell), if you read the conversations every day you will notice how the level of FUD spreaded every minute just with the objective of convincing the "poor" guy with weak hands reading the chat (and now REDDIT aswell for bigger income) is incredible. All this text is a sucession of "facts" that cannot be proved by a organized group of traders that don't love anything more in this world that short bitcoin with its huge spikes. Just join tradingview and check the chat for a few days. You will realize about the level of FUD. These traders don't stop before anything, they are not bitcoiners, they don't have any ideal behind their motives, just people shorting the market no matter if it is death insurances, food in the third world or whatever, it is their "job" to surft the waves and the most sociopath of them with the least empathy is normally the most successful one. We know this from wall street already. 
They intent here is to launch a torpedo against the bitcoin ship waterline in the most fundamental point, that bitcoin is growing as a new technology as Google or Facebook or Twitter or many others did before and the minibubbles are a consequence of that fact and that bitcoin is indeed growing greatly, fundamental to check this info to see how this growth is absolutely real

tl dr; i think financial sector (the parasite) has grown too big for the "host" (the planet) to resist it. I don't say it is entirely bad, i am sure it brings many opportunities to the world, but when it is way too big, too risky, and their games are not punished because they are "too big to fail" the host (the planet) suffers way too much. We have a feverish world right now.
and i am not mad. I just invest on bitcoin. it could prove to be a nice aspirin to reduce the financial sector. Cheers.

sometimes i feel we cannot win. we are a minuscule ant saying all day that we will harm banks.    
they have the biggest weapons, infinite money and rigged Government.   
just buying thousands of miners they can either increase difficulty infinitely taking any competitor out of the market and making them sell their bitcoins like now or just short the market infinitely. they can even naked short the market forever as is an unregulated market .   
they can also just create an exchange and with reserve banking simulate sells forever. or just pay some existing exchange to rig their market.   
and not even talking about other means, like promoting a tax per gb downloaded to increase price, or throttle p2p speed, promoting heavy regulations like new york. 
starting to get tired of this downtrend.   
 they are rigging everything and we are publicly stating that crypto is banks biggest threat. and they somewhat believe it because even imf and biggest banks ceos have been talking about bitcoin. 
can someone bring some faith back to me and let me know why they are not going to rig crypto like libor, gold, silver, the stock market and even justice, constitution and everything for their benefit?  
maybe i just have a bad day

I wonder where did I read that an interesting approach would be to separate the core node from the wallet. I think some people find scary to broadcast that they are bitcoin users and/or with a wallet, even using different software for both concepts just broadcasting bitcoin could bring unwanted visitors to your computers. Not saying that I share that opinion. I have a node.

i agree, it is not a practical naming. privacy is a human right, naming the wallet dark wallet only reduces public acceptance and in this late sad world of political propaganda you are giving bullets to your enemies. something like privacy wallet, personal wallet, family wallet, family safebox, digital safebox, privacy keyring, securewaller, safewallet or who the hell knows. dark side wallet is not good either or kingpin wallet

i know that and as i said you won't see me buying gbtc, but the same as for you is easy to download a wallet and buy and store real bitcoins, i have the understanding that for some hedge fund managers and investment entities could be legally easier to buy and hold a "standard" instrument and not a bitcoin wallet. that difference in utility and easiness appreciation coul explain the actual price unless until arbitrage and future appearence of more legally equivalent instruments reduce the price of these "paper"  Frankensteins. of course just an opinion, i am not a professional in the matter.

When we modify the scarcity of the blocks, aren't we reducing to some point a side part of the value of bitcoin. I mean, bitcoin has a value as a currency, but also it is being used as a ledger for tether like transactions (or maybe also the nasdaq future decentralized storage for equities). So bitcoin derives its value to some extent from the mining ratio that always will need to be secured (and have some certain value to secure the value inside the ledger) but also its value as a transaction "stamp". 
   
How will an infinite growing non-scarce model for the block size affect the economy of bitcoin? if a bigger part of the usage of bitcoin is in tether-type of transactions instead of the currency itself?
  
I mean, if we have a limited block size, even based on some growing formula that creates some scarcity even as bitcoin grows. and bitcoin is used as a "stamp" for the transactions, those fees-stamps will have some value. If we give a 40% block growth forever, the "stamps" would maybe be just a few satoshis in the future?
If bitcoin transitions (or just shifts a big part of its economy) from being a currency to being transaction "stamps" is reducing the scarcity a way to confiscate the "stamps" of initial bitcoiners, making them just holders of huge amounts of ever decreasing valued stamps?
I just hope we don't end like Peter Schiff said at the beginning, that bitcoin is inflationary as it could have infinite decimals. I think block size should be made scarce in some way and that is also an important part of the design as we don't have to forget that at the end and more and more every 4 years, only the transactions fees will be giving the value to bitcoin. I think a formula that allows growth with a competitive transaction fee but also penalizes too many transactions that reduce the bitcoin currency value. Maybe we should check how many transactions do we expect in 1y, 2y, 4y, 8y, considering that on 2016 the reward per bitcoin will be half and in another 4 years more half of that aswell, and the transactions will be 2x and 4x more important at that time. So how many transactions do we exect, what will be the fair value of the fee for them, also keeping competitive price with other payment methods.
I think a math model needs to be created, and the actual approaches of 20, 21, 1, etc are just not scientific models that consider the economic implications of the block scarcity but just thum guesses.
Just some thoughts, I find the issue pretty complex.

Oh sorry then. Not hating really. Is just that we have had too much "community disruption" for a couple years already and well maybe your joke had casually a couple common characteristics with the usual disruptor.       
  
One, disturbing serious conversation with "hate" agressive comments trying to induce emotional response in the community and limiting moving forward on any useful direction.      
 
Second, attacking barman. I have not met him nor do I condone or follow or not follow his opinions but he is one of the guys in charge (aka mods) now of the bar and I prefer even an ugly barman than having a totally deserted bar with hundreds of hooligans fighting over the same shit for months (years maybe?) and having all the normal guys with families and children that only want a fair share of bitcoin daily menu scared and moving instead to the new "Ether" fancy bar (nothing against them) around the corner. My apologies.

Shutdown your computer. Don't start it anymore. We don't want anything writing on the disk or it could use a "deleted" area in the disk effectively overwriting your wallet. Your wallet might be marked as deleted but just that, marked not effectively deleted and can be recovered with some tools.    
So don't use the disk at all. Make a copy of the disk taking it to someone if you don't know how. Then on the copy you can try safely to restore the data with tools like recuva  ( if windows).
   
Anyway this is just a general idea. If the amount is enough there are professional services to recover data from hard disks.   
Depending on how much and the usage percentage of your disk since your wipe the wallet file could maybe be intact as I said just marked as deleted.
For next time . There are services like crashplan that with a really ridiculous price a year allow you to backup everything on your computer without limit to the cloud. (There are many similar services like that. With varied privacy/price/storage/capabilities. Or you could use a local NAS or both or whatever).    
Just an idea but simply put you NEED TO have a backup. It is not serious not to have one as we use more and more computers in our lifes. Even without total wipes sometimes you have a document lost or even you prefer yesterday's version or you delete something or whatever and having a backup is priceless and feels great.    
Hope you can recover the wallet.

Sadly marketing creates many problems. Wonder if a world with objective wordings and announcements for products and services would save the world billions of hours wasted in misconceptions and plain lies.     
Maybe a blockchain proof system where wordings and announcements are written by two layers of totally independent observers instead of the "you won't find anything better we don't fail ever crappy product that has thousands of human beings with limited time actually losing it" until market discovery removes the inneficiency.

Like most things in this world. It is about equilibrium. It is not hard to remove half of the occurrences of something.     
 Probably you can somewhat easily remove most occurrences of a problem. It is the extreme percentiles that are hard has hell to remove.         
For example and without talking about the typical horsemen: we could have a marvellous government that decides to start a war against cancer. Even if it appears as a good ethical objective in order to remove that cancer and leave not a fucking cancer case in the country. They would need to monitor what we eat , when, place cameras in some orifices for all population, blood tests before eating, SWATS entering your home under the hamburger alarm sound? Everybody hates cancer but do we really want a 1984 so the government can fight with every single case? 
 Don't let the solution to your problem be worse than the weighted (in population) pain the sickness creates.   
   
Reduce car accidents in a 60% AWESOME.
Reduce car accidents to ZERO?   No thanks that would be 1984
Why? because the measures to take grow exponentially with the percentiles.
Sadly they WANT 1984

Is this the new shilling strategy? Try to sell to the world that bitcoin is the currency of the bad guys? And before 2009 what did the bad guys use? stamps?
    
- -- cut here and send to newspaper shilling team - --
Everybody was happy in paradise. War was unknown. Same as drug and poverty. Everybody was happy and that was good.  But...  one day in 2009 (or maybe later because noone used it then) man discovered bitcoin and EVIL was born. 
The reddit asslicker team warned everyone in every forum and Web page in the world and big fat checks were received. The news warned population that the malign had brought us the EVIL Bitcoin. 
But don't worry. The world was saved and bitcoin was outlawed as cash and as those evil amazon and starbucks cards.        
Paradise for the few continued for ever and renewed as blockchains could not even be shutdown by puny states controlled by supranational entities of non democratically elected members. Adam Smith defined money as bottled work and as their printing was infinite so was their rights over the working time of others. Paradise indeed. The paradise of the pharaohs.

Daddy daddy - asked shill's daughter interrupting his daddy's tale- how can you be such a piece of shit to participate in this crap?. 
Oh my dear girl you are so confused --answered the shill--- The world is not about helping others, cure cancer or research for the good of all. Don't you ever make the mistake of standing for any ideal or trying to get a better world.
The world is about theft my darling. It is about stepping on top of the rest stealing all you can from the others. Homo sapiens is extinct. The world is for the homo bankster. Don't you ever forget. When you are older I will give you some pounds so you can burn them in front of some poor bastard in the street so you remove any empathy you might still have like it is done in The City with noobs. Or if you don't reach a minimum level you can be a shill piece of shit like your dad if you prefer and just downvote shit in reddit for your masters.
It is the old tit for tat in all living species. Most benefit from working together even between species but "the too clever" benefit more in an unfair way from the others participating. Normally in that tit for tat game the loser would learn and adapt to not be lied again but with media, propaganda, etc the gregarious part of the population gets lied one and another and another time like if they had a vampire sucking their life at all times. 
So we are moving towards a vampire society. Forget about the cartoons or religious bullshit. They are going to suck your blood dry unless you are like them. No medicine, no ethics, no helping others, no good but for ourselves. That is the new path mankind has taken. 
Now sleep tight my darling.
Not sure I can dad.
Don't you worry my love just learn like those little fishes swimming around bigger sharks. Clean their shit and eat what they leave and don't you even dare look at their eyes. I will teach you to be the best shill.

There is no need to mediate on anything. They simply want to take over the development cycle to bring KYC red lists and whatever they desire. They will bring excuse after excuse.      
As JFK said "you cannot negotiate  with those that consider your things negotiable but they don't consider their things as such".      
Bitcoin is a printed on paper  immutable rules manual for the economic game and those that have been cheating without control on the game want to control the rules manual aswell or destroy it. Fairness is out of the question.     
What people don't realize is that a fair blockchain is very positive but a blockchain used with bad intent is a horrible tool against liberty.

Thanks for pointing that out. What I meant is that I don't really care about this guy business or how is he doing. There are many unethic things in the world that are useful at one point or another but that does not make them less unethical.  I think the general consensus of this thread is that this guy is using some ancestral unethical legal bullshit feature in his own benefit and the usefulness of his company for someone in particular does not change that.   
I could create a parser, check every word or sentence in the wikipedia, check it against the trademark patent or whatever database and register it and then spend the rest of my life suing the world. Well I would not even dare to check myself in the mirror out of pure disgust.

I really like andreas but I missed the tsunzu art of war chapter where you constantly inform the other one telling them that they are fucked.    
Instead of so much money money money bitcoin could have given more emphasis to the trustless or the neutrality features in the initial steps and money Trojan later.
 Neutrality has existed for ever because it brings some advantages for everyone: arbiters, judges, voting, ""justice"", escrow, etc. Even powerful people benefit from an environment with "perceived" neutrality or there would be far less business. (Would you sell your ico assets without escrow? )
Showing the world a trust less neutral protocol could have received more backing : diplomats,  international mercantil issues, notary services, escrow and mediation services unaffected by this or that 4 year government coercion. 
I think was the same Andreas who said that bitcoin could have been named as trust network.     
 Once other players in a game theory way with multiple parties had noticed how useful is a neutral trustless entity and had interest on defending and accepting that neutrality you could bring more emphasis on the  money Trojan but starting in 2012 and 2013 warning bankers about how they were finished has only created a massive  resistance and slowed bitcoin. 
Anyway just a thought, sure Andreas knows better. He is awesome
@_date: 2016-06-20 03:20:34
Bitcoin is more wasteful because it  provides trustlessness &amp; neutrality as one of its inner characteristics  and to defend those characteristics it has to be built with some security and defense measures that need more resources than other traditional alternatives.     
To defend that neutrality bitcoin has to be able to defend from coercion or external interference that is alien to its rules and it uses decentralization and replication of its data aswell as some mathematic logic to defend itself.
Localized structures like the biggest pyramids, castles, papers, libraries and even history itself etc have all been beaten by time, sometimes for the best reasons like building a wall to defend a population from an invasor.    
What at one time was a perfectly reasonable reason to dismantle an architectonic structure or burn a book (and there will always be a reason because governments, states, ethics change) has devoided humanity of their past and incredibly valuable information.
If the Library of Alexandria could have been replicated,( including all the overhead of replicating books and papyri in two or 3 different locations in the world ) in such a way that we could still read their documents from 8000 bc. Would it have been considered a waste?   
We live in an equivalent world in finance aswell. It is like if every 4 or maybe 10 years the gravity law is changed (for a good short term reason here and there aswell) in the financial world. That would be impossible in architecture. We would have buildings built and crashing in 5 to 10 years. No foundation, no solid layer. It would be incredibly wasteful.
If only we could have a solid foundation, a solid NEUTRAL layer in which the financial world could construct maybe we could see financial "cathedrals" instead of the actual mud brick houses we have to see bubble and bust every few years as there are no NEUTRAL laws of physics or maths but just quicksand.
Bitcoin and THE neutral, public blockchain can bring that resilience and that solid math based foundation. Many civilizations relied on traditions or in songs to pass some information to their sons and in that scale of time there could be good kings but here and there a tyrant and those traditions were respected. 
We simply cannot expect to be fully permanent and the best subjects to all types of states and kings (inclufding the tyrant) during our history and not lose half of our soul as a civilization or impoverish it.
Here and there in history we are supposed to preserve "that" book from the pyre. 
Neutrality is and has been useful during history. Judges, voting, sports, scientific approach and methodologies. Even the rich can benefit from more trade when everyone perceives the environment as neutral and fair. But a neutral ledger, (foundation of more complex structures) should resist coercion.   
That is also bitcoin and the blockchain and to endure it needs some more resources but those should not be considered as wasted at all.

 Hey, Maybe one day we see someone that gets angry enough to kick their asses physically during the same interview. I guess is just an equilibrium between the perceived damage for the interview victim, the perceived sacrifice the victim took to get to his position, the unfair of the interview situation and finally how the frontal cortex of the interview victim computes the situation in a high pressure moment and hey maybe the victim also had a really bad day adding to the situation who knows.    
Maybe this is not the last "surprising" interview and one day we realize that someone permanently removed the interviewers smile and ask them to go have fun with their own lovely mothers.   
(Not saying that I condone or condemn any of these situations but if your interviewing model is to piss people off maybe -statistically- you could piss off too much someone, someday).  
May I suggest a wonderful guy related to bitcoin to interview and get out of his comfort zone?

It is surprising, for example, BBVA (not my bank), the bank behind/investor on Coinbase only allows to set 6 characters or numbers. 
WFT? Can someone explain the reasoning behind that? Actually i think they have improved it and before they only allowed numbers. Do they really want to have a plausible doubt defense behind "oh, we have been robbed?"
My actual bank follows the same policy. A retardedly low number of characters that i would not dare to use even for a disney.com account. Not that i am even half reasonably proficient on security... (more like the guy on Op's article really)
And seems is common in other places 
Hey i am not talking about that pesky horrible policy of renewing your password every X days or even have some fancy 2 second authentication, but such a low level of characters and numbers?
Do they really "want" to be hacked here and there or maybe you really don't give a shit when you are bailed in when needed? Or maybe they are not concerned about thieves from OUTSIDE the firewal??
Probably not, banks would not behave like that, naah, let's forget about this conspiracy weird idea.

I have not been dishonest in my life really (maybe some stupid things when i was younger but nothing even remotely important) but you don't have why to believe a random guy in the internet (and that is another point of bitcoin). Regarding illegal or legal stuff maybe am i the only one that buys stuff in steam, pays some bills here and there? ( i don't think so )
Is it so hard to believe that there are some people really tired of paying huge fees, fines at the end of the month when paying with their bank? Or that there are some people in some countries that really have to defend against incompetence and totally unfair regulations? My country is not the case, let's say is "average", is more the bank fees really and some unfair things that have made me dislike them to some point. Anyway i prefer to pay some stuff using a bitcoin payment service than using my bank (even if it is expensive!!, at least i choose to do it).
And why are you here if you dislike bitcoin? I prefer Android over Apple or the opposite but i don't spend a thursday/friday/saturday bashing what in your standards is just another "idiotic fanboy" and keep keep keep with the same stuff for days.
Really i think you do have some meat on this issue.
I am going to concede that yes there are some bad actors, there is a lot of speculation, there is gambling but saying that the bitcoin market is almost all illegal (as said in the first post of this thread) is unfair and there are enforcement reports that say the same.
But seriously i have my opinions, you have yours. I don't think we are going anywhere with this conversation.

Takeover attack? first ban on then segwit not going that fast (not related) now casually this.  
nullc might not be very happy right now, probably was not very happy being banned from btc after putting some serious effort there to be understood.
Same with segwit after a serious lot of awesome work.
And after this ridiculous ban left aside and feeling slightly disconnected from the community with some additional "casual" shit. 
A couple additional ugly casual events more and he might be quite pissed off. 
Someone wouldn't mind weakening core and putting another in charge?
Or maybe someone is just deflating slightly the sentiment balloon (very correlated with price) and get some quick money?
Has the theme/sentiment of the subreddit slightly switched into segwit failed (although it is not taking more than other times), core not that strong and ridiculous ideas like stagnant bitcoin forever waiting for a million alts and hyperledger to reduce the first mover advantage and at the same time remove the need on the dev team?
Market manipulation?. Is it so difficult to have a botnet a group of shills or a few curl scripts downvoting and upvoting here and there and change the sentiment after a couple days? Moving from total bullish euphory into this is not workiing, leaderless feelings of after all this time segwit has not worked and now nullc banned... and the only chance now is bigblocks ?
Maybe someone could do both things at the same time and get some money from other coins where he has invested aswell as weakening core? Do we have anyone in the community that could do those two things? 
Ridiculous ideas? very likely, i am just speculating, but in bitcoin we have seen so many types of attacks that considering options does not hurt.
EDIT: many downvotes. i might not be that far

90% of humanity is moving to a kentucky fried chicken food processing plant. 
Actual situation is: there are 7 billion chickens in the farm. So the farmer says: "every chicken in the farm!, move inside the trucks silent and following the queue !. There are some wolves nearby. It is for your own security". Every step we are closer and closer to our fried wings destiny.
Or maybe we are one of the billions of donkeys that used to work to provide resources and we are now taking our master to the city so he can buy a new AI, robotics,  blockchain automated working vehicle and then taking us to the butcher. 
Humanity has divided in two species : one that blatantly announces in interviews that they know they will never die. One that can appear as superheros in social media after campaigns and donations. Capable of doing massive propaganda, with quasi palantir technologies, above laws and political processes and with a wand that could put to shame harry potter`s as moving it you summon the infinite forces of printed money, making anyone do whatever you want, the more they need it, the better. 
On the other side we have the old frree man that it is only a shadow of itself. One that would get a 15000 years mortgage in case he lived so long. One that is living under what all mankind in every type of religion and civilization since Babylon considered another form of slavery and was considered even worse than assasination -&gt; USURY. 
Being spied at any moment. Under more and more and more thousands of laws every year that he is forced to preemptively know and follow. Being requested the 99% of its purchasing power during his life through inflation, multiple taxes and at the end sucession. His thoughts and mind being constantly under attack of propaganda, advertisements etc. 
Life seems good anyway playing the newest phone gane and watching another tv serie.  The social change process is very slow to avoid traumas and problems.
In an infinite world everything would continue forever in a constant process of increasing the herd numbers.
But we are in a finite world and very very dirty and although the herd does not pollute with their private jets they dont have effective decision power either. Would you reduce your living standards for one cow in a million head herd? 
So we have reached a point in which it is not about liking or not liking the latest phone game but a situation in which under planet limited resources our understanding of reality, knowledge , social decisory power or economic means and what we bring to this limited world will collide. There is a limited cake but we are being left out of the kitchen. 
Why have so many eaters polluting our masters garden when the financial activity iself is totally rigged and they dont need any market discovery and they just get all the printed money they want?. Why feed so many when AIs, robotics,  blockchain can do (very soon) all the work the herd used to do?
The olympus gardens or elysium is almost there, ... for them. There was an evolutive survival game and we lost it: too much tv, games and beautiful ""democracy"" and equality words but they were just a mirage. 
Like during all life history there has been an evolutive competition for resources. Evolution rewards to some extent gregarious approaches, but they simply cannot work with 7 billion people on a badly allocated limited resources planet.
Will the reduction of women fertility rate through empowerment be enough to effectively change our destiny and avoid getting over 10 billions? Do we have 50 years for population fertility to do its job or are we going to see other measures. Are we watching them unfold already but at social advance speed so slow they are as noticeabke as sol movement in the galaxy arm?

I believe it but sometimes you get angry for a few decades (?). 
Just an example. I used to connect to internet using my phone company (at that time it was a monopoly). I had to pay regional phone fees then (really expensive maybe 1/3 of a euro per hour (??) but 20 years ago (cannot remember)). 
They used to cut the connection and get again and again and again up to maybe 10 times the reconnection fee and you received huge phone bills just because I wanted to use the internet to help my nontechnical parent then to make some medical researchs and the huge fees risked every month when the bill arrived to have him simply forbid me the access internet again.
I fucking hated the company (monopoly again).
Decades have passed and they are now a worldwide telecom internet provider company, all their data goes through internet and they are totally pro internet obv. 
And do you know one thing? They are marvellous now, they work incredibly well (i cannot believe i am writing this about those old bastards, ... how much i hated them :D ) and i am back with them and happy!.
But for a few decades i couldn't be more angry with them. I used every chance talkign with colleages to say what was my opinion. 
We didn't have shills like you then (they are learning). 
I am at a similar stage now with my bank. Well not so much reallly. I think i hated more the telecom company then. My bank is well a bank that is stealing all they can or that is my feeling every single month. At some point they have even charged me to send a confirmation email .......
If they work very well in the future (and they probably will) who knows. But for now i just need them out of my life even if i need to pay more to their competitors.
The national air company had the same monopoly problem. at some point. They work pretty well now aswell. The electic company is european wide now and they used to be a shit monopoly aswell.
There are things in this world that (i am not an economist, just a personal opinion) don't work perfectly obviously and monopolies don't help at all. They just keep living and living and living in the inefficiency and complacent shit because nobody can do anything. 
It is like those little areas with stale water in the coast where the sea never manages to mix and small sick creatures have their kingdom until one big wave arrives and they are all wiped out. Evolutionary temporal niches (?). It is even bad for them, they get complacent, even being good at what they do. For example, i have the feeling that the BBVA is moving their arses and doing their homework. I am pretty surprised really.
Enjoy the weekend, you shill or check your notebook. Sure there are some other subreddits you should be paying attention to aswell. Check i think there is one guy that has said that word, .. "rights" i think. Can you believe it? Hey you might get a plus.

Does not matter. They will do whatever they want when they want. Truth, reality and words bend under they feet. Was gold similar to something in 1932? Did it make any difference for those that were forced to sell it at gift prices ?
It is about power. They have incredibly powerful tools to achieve what they want  The same that you have the power to do many things at your hands, they can change peoples opinion, use marketing, propaganda, modify laws and classify people under some categories so their hammer has the biggest effect. Of course it is a grayscale of power level. Some can do surprising things and many cannot do anything.
And they will use those tools, the same as you user your limited ones. They simply are at a totally different level.
Their job is trying to improve their situation compared to what their had, or their neighbours or family exactly like yours. They simply have Ferrari power level tools like their friends, colleagues,  etc and of course they are going to use them. You simply have a toy bicycle power level. Then talk with senators, prime ministers, judges, comissions the same confidence as you talk with the owner of the grocery in your street. "Get me the best fruits or get me the best of this or that in politics is like you doing your shopping :) ". Social rules are difficult to enforce on those situations and we see it with politicians, bankers, ceos, etc. They are above that 
Bitcoin Blockchain seems to be doing its job and this is just a different perspective of why it is important: Even the Monopoly board game comes with instructions printed with permanent ink. Even those playing monopoly need some stability. If even there there are no rules at all the financial game the planet is playing goes to hell.
The world needs a NEUTRAL instruction not mutable ruleset for machines, ceos, normal people, the same the world has an inmutable gravity law that allowed the construction of pyramids and cathedrals,  the financial game needs a NEUTRAL gravity law so financial cathedral structures such as those to finance Mars, prepare for increase of sea level or just optimization of resources can be built. Do you think we would have a single standing marvel If any little king, tyrant etc could have changed gravity at will?
We are right now on financial quicksands every 10 years destroying any financial structure with crisis and constant crashes.
The same as physics, and mathematics are based on universal laws that allow them to be sciences, the financial world (born instead as a ever mutable human construct ) could start being a science but it needs a NEUTRAL anchor, information based layer where humanity can build bigger and bigger bricks, not a permanent quicksand arena where the biggest predators win some advantages destroying everything around them.

i think he might be under a gag order and he has been offered something he cannot reject (?) 
    
He moved from not being allowed to enter his excountry after he rennounced his citizenship,  being held forever in every airport into full shill mode.  something has changed (?). 
He had some issues in the past and maybe they were going to be revisited (?). .  
he financed many bitcoin companies and was totally and based on body movements genuinely enthusiastic probitcoin but something changed and now he has antagonic attitude, and even finances competitors? he has moved maybe from being an idealistic quite naive enthusiastic funny rebellious guy into a shadow of himself and somebody that reflects what he most hated 5 years ago. 
so has his hate or dislike against statism that moved him to abandon his own nationality moved below the pure hate he has against Core even if this one was financed or had some hidden interests as he suggests? even at the point of hurting his own assets?. something is not right here. 
i think he is being directed like many others that the community has lost in the bitcoin history. 
if you read the antilaundering laws they do not offer much option. at some point the participants simply have to remain silent.  the penalties can be severely reduced if the accused cooperates.  
i think this is more a case similar to the movie of the bodysnatchers.

Brainwallets (old ones) are dangerous in a special way. I dont desire for anyone the nightmare I had to pass for 8 months until I managed to crack the passphrase/modified poem (way too long and even a couple differences on accents took months to combine).. I even tried with hypnosis.
Besides I wonder if in 30 years someone will find in a tunnel instead of a train full of gold teeth a train full of brains under cryonic conservation.Such a funny awakening. .. :-) /jk instead of nothing as clear as death and taxes it will be just taxes.. we need proof of nobrainwallet where people can prove that they did not use a brainwallet in order to be let rest. .. maybe some kind of multisignature that relies in some external event

here, i added a small modification regarding your post :
 "... arguments? i use my arguments (that are reasonable, many times yes and many times not so much) in useful circumstances. 
Do i really need to argue that the main use of bitcoin is for illegal payments? Do i need to spend my time trying to convince you of it? Or is it reasonable to think that both you and stolfi are just trolling here? I think this is the case and no i won't lose my time more with you. I think it is pretty clear. If you go to an Apple forum (or viceversa Android or whatever) and just start saying that Apple is absolute 100% garbage it is evident that you are just trolling. There is nothing else really. 
So either you are retarded and cannot see it, or you are a troll trying to put some lemon in an open wound inflicted into totally rightful users of a technology that are being hurt by this guy that uses his phd to short the market and uses the SEC document as a revenge against bitfinex (probably he has lost money/not that i like bitfinex). 
In both cases in my opinion you are a "cretin": mentally retarded or a maybe a totally incorrect insult because i should have said that you are a piece of crap and you are hurting good people that....  "

Thanks !..
First I got bitaddress downloaded on a usb. Booted with a live Cd without network and got the brainwallet of a funny poem I have known forever but as I have been remembering it for decades and I dont even know its origin, it is not like the real one but my own decades wrong interpretation. It was pretty long, maybe 200 chars but not happy with that I added some numbers and a couple non English characters. I could memorize it very easily and it was not the first time I stored and later successfully sweeped it back. So I just noted down the address and sent a nice amount of coins.
Every day I repeated it and I was pretty confident. I even downloaded an android app that translated text and showed the address (an old mobile I  think has never been on inet again).
So it was successful and I felt confident and it was also the third brainwallet I think.
What happened? After a few months as I was so confident, although I still revisited the modified poem in my memory, I didnt check it entirely because it was there and I was confident and maybe a little lazy.
One day after some months after I created it I tried to remember it. I was not so confident this time as I had been quite busy and forgot rechecking for a couple weeks.
So I tried entirely and it was not correct, I tried again and again and again and everytime more nervous and worried. So I started to try very seriously in my desk with paper and pen and witting some notes but the tries didnt work. The money was still there but with cold sweat I realized more and more try after try that I couldn't remember the exact passphrase.
I didn't tell anyone to avoid worrying any on my family. Any other concern in my life was literally set aside due to this problem.
First I tried just some really crappy system and on a air gapped computer with bitaddress I started auto sending keys in the same browser at frontend side but it was damn slow obviously. I just thought it was a matter of a couple hous but I was so wrong :)
So on javascript I removed all the presentation part of bitaddress to increase the combination speed.
I have to say that I had at that point  a pretty confident idea of the general form of the paraphrase but the funny thing in brains (or at least mine) is that as I revisited and revisited and tried more combinations I started to get more "what if I did this?" "What if I did that". I wonder if even the constant revisit of the same damn funny poem was making my neurons strengthen their links with closest relatives even overlapping the then starting to be fragile understanding of what I though was the poem.
Im not sure if I am extending too much. I hope I am not boring you.
Anyway while my not that optimized yet cracking system was crunching and crunching combinations I also decided to attack the problem using many other so I tried to get all the information I could from the day (nothing as clear ad Blockchain anchor there). Having the data I checked password databases from the same periods. I normally am ver strict with passwords but in really stupid sites sometimes I give a small password license to myself and reuse a small part. Maybe that could be useful. 
Also I checked in my constant backups for what the hell I was doing that week, the week after, before so I could reconstruct some kind if diary to see if it could help me by some kind of association (?). Tried to find bugs on bitaddress. Something that could me in the browser cache. Some bits on windows forensics and keyboard buffers. But nothing really, just a more focused approach and discarded things maybe
On the coding side I visited vanity addresses code to see how did they maximize the combinations. Also mining code. I think I was using vitaliks pybitcoin then.
I had it with different threads on a couple vps plus my computer. 
I had something like part I knew 1 + x number of strings or symbols i was not sure + part I knew 2 + ....
And verifying  offline if was the holding correct one forever and forever.
Sometimes the light went off or you got the awesome windows update in this machine and the vps was not so powerful.
I had it send a mail in case it was found. Also small improvements. Tried faster memories, later tried with parts on pycuda.
It was a very special feeling and I think not many have felt the same. At least exactly. It was something so obsessive that I was thinking about what if this what if that in the cinema, in the bar while I was alone for a second. In the doctor.
It probably sounds ridiculous but sometimes I felt like I could get a, absurd idea, brain cancer or some shit if how sick and obsesive the issue was. 
Crunching and crunching I studied about some type of foods to improve memory. I tried to relax,  meditate and concentrate on the damn poem yet once more. ..
One day I found in.internet a piece about autohypnosis and I tried a few times, half of them ended asleep :)
Another day a barman asked me why the hell I was so lost in my thoughts and when I told him he invited me to a couple beers laughing the motherfucker. He sweared he had never found a weird situation like mine in his years as barman.
After researching in.my city I found an hypnosis sort of club and asked for a session. The woman said that she thought that was not going to work. I asked her if she knew about bitcoin in advance (maybe she could have sweeped the coins :D ). Only managed to relax me but I think she did not approached it correctly not even the questions.
One day I received the mail with the correct address so I had found it !!. I simply couldn't believe it and I think not many times I have been so happy in my life and for months!. But specially not having to revisit that damn black hole in my brain. 
Thanks for reading those that have managed to survive the wall of text :)

This is just an opinion on the economic importance of block scarcity. 
(Leaving aside the daily debate about spam, escalability, performance, vectors of attack,  blockchain size,  long term need of meaningful fees in 8 years for the miners (in two more halvings fees will be critical for them ) or even decentralization traditional debates we are reading normally.)
Having a market for block size gives bitcoin (the currency) a degree of scarcity important as store of value and improves network security in different ways and still allows it to be a trust network with other uses at the same time. 
On the other side, if the block size is big enough so it is not scarce it would remove valuation of initial adopters investment allowing companies to use the network with colored coins or similar constructs just paying 1 cent to send a trillion dollars or any kind of asset. 
Bitcoin price for them would be as important as a old mail "stamp",  exactly the reason given by Warren Buffet on 2013 to say that Bitcoin was worthless.  
Does anyone remember? 
         "It's a mirage basically, it's a method of transmitting money, it's a very effective way of transmitting money and you can do it anonymously and all that... a check is a way of transmitting money, too. Are checks worth a whole lot of money?"
I don't agree with his view but non scarce blocks would transform bitcoin + colored coins in a check fee or a mail stamp. 
Bitcoin the currency could end being only needed to pay a very small fee for usage (there would be still some need of valuation so the miners are motivated enough).
Initial investors would have invested on having a billion mail "stamps" more than a store of value but with a block size trending to infinite the stamp price would be like 0 and any colored coin construct no matter its completely or cost would be sent for basically free.
i think core's approach is perfect.  Preserving the store of value and with lighting allowing a cheap value network. 
What do you think?

I do not agree. There is a sea of difference between newcomers lured by some greed or any financial incentive that still will learn and love the underlying tech and implications and the cold point of view of cynic pure market traders that can be trading HBL,CYB,TJL,SRV (random invented instruments) o whatever without giving a shit.
A little greed could bring not only some money but also new useful members for the community if they get interested.
I think closing the biggest door of newcomers (greed or financial incentive) from the technology, the ideas or the rest of the community  is a mistake

Is it naive to feel uncomfortable when moving from a decision model that has taken bitcoin so far from its inception to be known worldwide . do we really know where are we going? i just think we have to be extracarefull and bring some technological approach to the decision making receives as less interference as possible. maybe a decentralized reddit with math proven signatures for posting or something similar. doesn't justice try to avoid disruptions to public trial decissions?

I don't think most people is aware what could be happening here. we are talking about permissionless ledger with currency against permissioned equivalents by the typical cronies. There is huge implications on what will happen here with the cronies trying to defend or coerce any new invention to keep their free money/power tricks for a few more centuries. Satoshi created a Tour de force against any social and engineering attack. Engineering resiliancy has been proved for years attack after attack, thanks to your work guys. But there are Agencies, masters of social enginnering and internet community disruption with huge resources. I think that is what is happening here  I don't know if they will kill the honey badger but maybe they smear its image even more giving the idea that a permissionless ledger is just a ridiculous idea of some idiots so the world should move to jpmorgan bankchain or similar. I think satoshi did not prepare bitcoin well enough for a "vires in numeris" on the leadership and general project direction side. They can break the community and set it back forever (or decades) and leave a sour remind in our hearts that they always win and we were just naive.

besides the lovely fantasies of batman and robin we have all enjoyed where they save the day every night in their batmobile, there is a real world where people gets stolen half of their money every 20 years under "normal" inflation or where in some countries you can lose all its valuation in a couple months or even days like in Venezuela or in Zimbabwe sometime ago. in those situations having your money out of government reach is basic for survival

so bitcoin although is trustable in the blockchain side it is hugely vulnerable to social engineering and internet community disruptions? hopefully the centralization of "bitcoin media" resources where people get in contacts with the available paths does not lead bitcoin to be a non-technically centralized but still controllable new liberty reserve. all this block debate has been quite suboptimal

Margincalled orders filling but buy orders at lowest prices not filling.... That has a word from our dictionaries that has been kidnapped for political reasons: TERRORISM (financial/economic sense) : inflicting absolute TERROR of losing their hard earned money to thousands of indiscriminate savers and workers (including traders here aswell) that are tryng to survive in times of huge financial turmoil, from countries like Argentina, Greece, Nigeria or western countries. That is the name TERRORISM, sorry but i don't see why only a few chosen politicians can label that word upon others when it is there in the dictionary for everybody (check wikipedia if you don't know its definition) . Wonder how many victims have nightmares and wake up with cold sweat after the traumatic terror episode or multiple small scams and rigs, knowing that they have lost a substantial amount of savings so these inept, disgusting people can, who knows, buy a new Lambo, hire a whore or blow something up their noses. It is the equivalent for many prepper people to find out that the rice they bought and carefully stored for the survival of their family in ultimate instance is totally rotten or he has been sold small stones. Many people trade and started trading bitcoin with the only objective of DEFENDING their small family savings in a volatile currency that we hope will be here in 20 years, a currency that still they need because they have the bad luck of living in countries under incredible financial distress. And please don't come to me with the "invest only what you can afford to lose" because that would leave out those "B"illions the bitcoin community tries to cater to and that we know they are not in situation to play around with their incredibly scarce resources. Sorry for being so harsh, but WE ARE ALREADY DAMN TIRED of the long succession of exchange scams in bitcoin world, really damn tired.

i think financial regulations are being proven daily inneficient where huge banks can do whatever they want and small individuals get the hard stick. i really think corporativism and cronyism is at this stage s worse risk for the rule of law than some individual actions. i also think that we cannot create 50.000 new laws and regulations every year (or five years, don't know the exact number). I think the state is inneficient as it does not die and live by market discovery and bigger and bigger state to infinity is harmful for society. i think finally that new techs and startups should be given a chance to survive and thrive the same as the fisher brings back the smallest fishes to the sea. i think bitlicense has been a present from Benjamin Lawsky to some cronie banks to avoid disruption adding huge complexities to the law that of course a developer wont be able to overcome, same as many startups. big institutions with huge teams of lawyers will thrive in new York waters from now on. imho

conspiracy theory is a term to attack anyone with enough critical and lateral thinking to just not accept per se the generally accepted opinion. what i see here is MEDIA working to shift public opinion, ridicule some developers, show others as geniuses for some kind of agenda.  PLEASE leave the developers talk and reach some kind of consensus and leave the social engineering of people that don't know a shit about the inner workings of bitcoin behind. Respect the experts. Don't bring public opinion to a open heart intervention or the patient will die. If it is 1Mb or 100Mb i cannot tell the right and perfect answer and i have been a software engineer for 25 years. Don't interfere with ridiculous shit about how this proponent is more goodlooking or prettier. Please leave shit, non inforned opinions and politics out of engineering decissions.

@_date: 2015-08-13 06:59:14
i agree, constant updates could very well reduce dramatically bitcoin security from math based rock solid security to a much lower security level depending on social engineering, massive technical obfuscation leading to everyone leaving those decisions on developers, media attacks (where some social campaigns, ugly developer photo here or glorified one for another there. we will change huge security proven thousands of times to a poor permanent parliamentary decision were the attacks will be people bringing cartoons or photoshopped developers, other developers talking at ophra's. And i think we should not forget that the time the world realizes, hope never happens, bitcoin permissionless blockchain is not more trustable than a permissioned blockchain it will lose a huge appeal for its user base    TLDR and question to Mike Hearn. So you are proposing moving from a vires in numeris system to a constant referendum after referendum on reddit and similar platforms common and lowest user denominator? how long until bitcoin ends just a slightly more decentralized liberty reserve but socially controllable? how long until, it is already in the news everywhere, bitcoin is forgotten and the marvellous real invention, the blockchain starts being used by who knows.. googlecoin.

Agreed, also the only reason for bitcoin to exist is if it provides s neutral ledger or data structure out if coercion. We should be well damn careful to care about that neutrality and bring sound arguments and not just a couple funny cartoons or pictures making fun of any developer or glorifyng other.  The day, really hope it does not come, when it is evident that bitcoin is being coerced and controlled, that day many users and institutions will use permissioned blochains leaving bitcoin for the history books. In general i would just suggest to be as extra careful as satoshi was with his privacy and as careful as he was with the whole bitcoin trust nature. Hope we don't leave bitcoin development decisions in the future to Oprah show or the daily mirror making fun of this or the other developer or the equivalent reddit up or downvote campaign. If we do you can bet that in JPMorgan they will be damn happy with their permissioned blockchain and how permissionless was just the proven dead dream of some idiots.

So you think that casually you have found a rare reddit organism "that believes that satoshi rolled out everything right and nothing needed to be done later" in the bitcoin subreddit and in a thread talking about developers.

i agree with you there. i am just scared that a software project gets overpolitized and even taken over by some group with unknown agendas. more than 20 years ago nerdish people invented the internet and many women and males would not give a shit but to ridicule the nerdish idiots with their silly computer boxes. That did not stop the world from embracing the new tech. 
I think bitcoin should be embraced with a pure scientific and objective approach and using beautiful quixotic equalitarian appearing approaches could be used as trojan horses.

Just considering adding an additional accent or symbol to the cruncher skyrocketed the calculation times but what if was needed???.    
I have never been happier than when I got it cracked and recovered my coins. I think I had 24 coins. I have not used brainwallets  since then.   
 It is a weird feeling losing money due your own brain limitations to remember and a bad feeling spending hours and hours of silly moments trying to remember again and again with no success, driving in the doctor waiting room in some queue, etc. It is very tiring, demotivating and I felt angered and quite stupid for many months.

A cultural and ethic change is immensely needed. When you take your children to kindergarten you don't expect the teacher to sit them in the streets nearby asking for money like a Dickens book. Same with medical professionals selling your limbs or most professionals around.
Why we have these rat lords there in the financial world? is it possible to be competitive and ethic? can we have the most or one of the most important branches in civilization ran by the hugest thieves ever? 
Or maybe without infinite greed and lack of ethics you simply cannot be competitive enough?    
Or are we sadly in front of a new evolutionary step in which if you are a doctor curing cancer or a software developer, a scientist of any kind you are an IDIOT losing your time because only THEFT is rewarded and only THEFT is important.   An IDIOT if you are teaching some minimal ethics to your children as they will just be a weakness for them?     
Are these really the new rules of the game?
Are we changing from the homo sapiens to the homo bankster evolutionary step?  
Is this really the future of civilization? Instead of moving towards civilization stage III in Kardashev's scale with Dyson Spheres, are we condemned to civilization stage -1 with Dimon spheres where everything under the sun and the whole human civilization rotates around the biggest bankster?

For what? to have a 25% unemployment for more than 20 years and northern Europe countries receiving the honey of our efforts. It is sad but there are many failed states in the world and some people only can hope to have some help from bitcoin or keep being permanently stolen without any possible defense from useless states that work against your wellbeing out of malice or plain stupidity.

The rethoric this Tim Swanson piece of scum is adopting it is pretty scary. Wonder if in the future some "powers" will use that rethoric to kill/jail innocent people that just want to add a small decentralization vector force to the politic equation to improve things. Sure he would gladly give us one of those sick smiles he has while repeating one time and another the "T" word. Wonder what horrible thing ALL bitcoiners have done to him so he has this attitude. If i had to ask this Tim Swanson a question, it would be: If i am an argentinian (i am not) that have been removed 3 time already of all my money, what do you suggest me to do? Harakiri or hang myself and my family... Here Mr Swanson you have an intersting documental about Argentinian last economic collapse  There is at one point one teacher that says how every day they had 7 children fainting daily on the school and when asked what did they had for dinner, they answer, "oh well, a soup, or a tea". Are those your cypherpunks? Shame on you Tim Swanson.

@_date: 2015-09-11 07:39:00
you don't need a blockchain for that. there has been many database auditing options for decades already and replication servers able to replicate at row, column, index, table and database level hugely escalable and with connections to any software package available in the world. blockchains were created to solve the byzantine trust problem. it is ridiculous to misuse the huge capabilities of db today but well the dazzled burocrats will talk with a it architect sooner or later. don't get me wrong i think blockchains are great but their main point is trustless nature and you need a blockchain that is not subject to any coercion and secure enough, if not you are missing the point and you could benefit of 30+ years of database advancee and of course already invested money in them. THE blockchain now is bitcoin, but well sadly we are going to live again the suffering of hundreds od customers from small centralized blockchain creators that offer a trust that is not there. we have seen it happen hundreds of times with many alts (some are interesting of couse but beware of the future sellet of the godly private blockchain because he will defraud many). wait and see

why? cannot normal people talk about bitcoin price? do we have to talk about price with traders? Actually price started to sink since people removed the naive investor and newcomer, techies or teeneagers from this sub and transferred them to a shark infested sea like bitcoinmarkets where they left scared as hell from a horde of cynic traders that don't care about the soul of bitcoin. Isn't there any place for naive people or hope or despair? Do we have to "listen" to traders supposedly money experts that arrived in the last wave that know a lot about price but nothing about value?

remove blocksize limit and add a fee dependant of (blocksize^k ) /stddev(blocksize, period). So the bigger the blocksize the bigger the fee they would have to pay. if the blocksize deviates too far from the norm of the prev X blocksizes they would have to pay astronomical fees (exponentially) . The period for the stddev could be very big so an attack would need to be sustained for months paying huge fees.

I agree with most of what you have said and well I am long and short on smaller time frames so not important really.
I think ethereum is too ambitious and their attack surface is really big. As software engineer for a few decades I think that critical systems should start with rock solid bricks and then grow. I have seen different speeds when adopting new technologies depending on the type of industry and it is not the same a totally critical system and another that it is not. 
Ethereum tries to be infinitely capable of doing anything a computer can do and that is very risky. There are vectors of attacks that might not be clear in first instance that might depend on the very foundations of blockchain technology and this is very new.
I think the slow no Turing completeness for now and grow securely slowly but steadily is more prudent that the let's open every possible situation with the people's money already in and when not even the network or mining or issuance or legislation (when they are under a social address that can receive a judicial or government order) are clear. The risks they are taking with such an ambitious approach could transform the project itself instead of being a project that is moving towards a planned direction and they could end suffering big sea waves that the have initiated themselves with their risky aproach. The dao was an example of how risks shaped the project to some degree instead of the opposite. If now they risk a bigger even situation they might end with another fork or with a severe legal regulation or who knows. 
They should take control of the ship but first test it properly in the lake and when that is secure as  hell move down across the river and when that is secure go to the bay, the sea and open your turing sails all you want. I think they have opened the sails when there are holes, things are not clear enough the weather is unknown.
Just my two humble cents. I expect the best for both projects aswell

The reason is that we need bitcoin to reach Civilization type I in  Kardashev's civilization scale. Some advanced civilizations could have Dyson Spheres around stars, giant structures absorbing all star energy.    
 Sadly at the current sage we have instead DIMON spheres and the whole human civilization goes around banksters that in an opposite way absorb all the civilization energy, so we are effectively on Civilization scale -1.

I know what is your point. And regarding your "fantasy worlds" you are trying to ridicule my argument calling it like that. I am answering to your argument about bitcoin needing half of the world's energy to safely protect another world of assets and both your argument and mine are futuribles so please disregard that "fantasy" adjective when i defending my point of view unless you just want to be right even through ridiculing others points of view.   
Countries do not attack internet submarine cables. We haven't had a big enough war or world war, and even if we do that infrastructure might or not be attacked. Bitcoin or a financial blockchain or even a replicated database system with redundancy points between cities and countries like many REAL banks have today bring resiliency against local catastrophes and have some inherent security costs. Bitcoin promotes a special type of security rewarding miners. Banks charge some money to their customers to handle their costs. Countries charge some taxes to their citizens to have some militar and legal enforcement. Do we really need half of the world investments into military to protect private property or social structures. No, it is far less. I am stating the same for bitcoin. You don't need half of the world's energy protecting the system. As soon as bitcoin or any other network or infrastructure is being used by a country and society it is in the society interest to defend it. Even if we just rely on mining defense and we leave out the incentives to defend a useful infraestructure, it is game theory. the moment it is detected that the network is being attacked through a X percent attack, other parties could try to increase their hashing rate and if the attack fades it is in everybody interest to slow the hashing rate. It could be like cold war and missile escalation, if everybody is using the infraestructure (world) and has some eggs in the basket (everybody's lifes) they could increase their deterrent force but it is expensive, specially in a "fantasy"  far future in which we only rely in fees.

There are many methods in github that allow you to create really fast a bitcoin payment on your Web. I don't think you will find you self overwhelmed selling here and there into bitcoin and sending that to services like Bitwala or cashilla and getting that on a debit card or to a sepa account using your mobile in 5 min. 
Specially when volatility in bitcoin is getting lower and lower . really low actually. 
There might be other methods for example you could have all your payment to a  mycelium wallet in your mobile and when you hear the sound in 30 secs and from the same mycellium you could lock them instantly into coinapult on the fiat currency you prefer for example. I think coinapult even allows to link you bank account should you neede it.
You could also give a bitcoin address that is pointing to a shapeshift into tether? not sure but maybe is possible.
Or like I said send them to cashilla Bitwala into a fiat bank account.
 Unless of couse you are getting an unmanageable number of bitcoin puchases but one here and there? otherwise you can use the traditional bit pay or coinbase?
Of course due diligence should be done because there might be fees involved .
Regarding address reusability and before someone downvotes the ideas i write here. In github there are web cashing methods with HD addtesses
@_date: 2015-10-20 22:33:24
probably many more people besides bitcoiners would care if they knew how removing cash is very dangerous for their privacy and for their money ownership as they will just be shareholders of the bank if things go wrong, adding to that having their money used for derivatives gambling and at the same time being charged with negative interest and spied and totally controlled on any transaction they make. An ONG is itching the state?  they won't be allowed to use their money. If this is not scary for privacy, property and civil liberties i don't know what is.

@_date: 2015-10-25 08:55:30
Don't worry. it has happened to all professions during their digitalization. Some had their olivetti or they kodak moment. They simply cannot believe or understand that disruption is coming to their profession from outside. They have been trained and teached to think how their profession evolution happened, why something was changed into something different in a long sucession of evolutionary steps.    
But their pirate ship, that has been sailing all over the seas of history and survived multiple problems, has many wooden planks, some rotten parts and when suddenly some strange nerdish computer engineers review all their functions, processes, objectives and bring maybe not a 17th century pirate ship but and incredibly fast sailor redesigned from scratch, many simply won't accept it and dissappear in the confrontation with those flexible enough to survive change.    
We are close, digitalisation has conquered everything. Now is the time of finances, and hopefully in some decades, the last step, politics. That long has needed a total engineering redesign so things DO work without bullshit medieval stuff that is hurting everyone. In many aspects, even them.

one dev said two days ago that we should not worry, that even if they used a bigger attack with higher fee and bigger amount of transactions it would be only a temporal nuisance that they already have a memory limiting code prepared on pull req and they are just waiting for more extensive testing. this was on bitcoin freenode irc (not bitcoin-dev but bitcoin). Seems they are more concerned for the long term decrease in number of nodes than these particular attack. Hope i have been exact remembering what he said.

i think is more the JFK sentence case: You cannot negotiate with people whose things are theirs and your things are negotiable.    
They don't want consensus, they want their consensus under their own rules and decide themselves the structure, who will be allowed, which is the token and their "fair?" share. I don't think bitcoin is perfect at all but still it is peer to peer. Their model is master/slave and they want to keep it like that.   
I live in a western country and we cannot complain as others.   
I think that there are many countries in the world where states systematically fail to defend the most basic human rights and one of the tools used against them due to who knows, incompetence, stupidity or maybe greed and corruption is incredibly inflationary currencies that remove citizens savings in few years.    
The statist case there would ask those citizens to deal with it, to be patriotic, to follow the rules and most do one and another time, in some cases being removed from all their money three times in a single generation. 
Do we allow the use of tor when freedom of expression is under peril in some regimes? is unethical to use tor in north korea or if you are a woman in Afghanistan or in a zone under conflict being a reporter? 
Bitcoin serves a similar function to some extent in many countries. I pasted two days ago a reddit thread with many links from google trends in countries with a huge sistemic problem where bitcoin was growing very fast.   
I really don't care if banks in Switzerland adopt their own blockchain, good for them, but consider that many states fail systematically defending the most basic human rights.   
My question is, if one person has been stolen 3 times already all his money what should he do? get his son and wife on bed and suicide all or keep placing confidence in a system that simply does not work?   
If all financial world creates an horizontal cartel where everything is permissioned to the max and even as some ask they bring a cashless society making bank accounts compulsory , it could work in sweden but in many parts if the world with huge corruption civil rights will be totally removed, people will be systematically removed from their savings not only through inflation but negatve interest rates or plain fund seizure for some reason.    
Bitcoin is very far from being perfect but there is a reasonable case for private money and this one is not that bad as you paint it. My two cents.

Everything can be destroyed or manipulated if enough effort is done. we have seen hacks, manipulation, documents burning, information classified under different levels so it cannot be disclosed. Documentation deleted by legal requirement. Paper has some security qualities. Database systems have other measures. Some information can just be seized, altered, deleted, forbidden just by some pressure by some lobby, or by a government official.  
 Every architecture has some advantages and some disadvantages and it is up to the architect or the designer to choose what to use. In some permissionless architectures, even the user can decide what they want to use. If i am Venezuelan i could prefer to use a stateless currency. If i am receiving billions of euros from some organization of course i would prefer euros. Are telephone lines, satellites, internet submarine cables totally invulnerable?  is database or backup software hack or bug proof? bitcoin is antifragile and like linux will grow better with time.

Regarding the "the really there is no point in placing assets into blockchains unless you want to place everything" is ridiculous. At this very moment there are dozens if countries that fail consistently and daily protecting the most basic rights of their citizens, one is the ability to preserve their savings against theft, ineptitude and corruption. Bitcoin helps them there bringing a lateral computing system (far from perfect) where many can find nore security than in their failed countries currencies. Regarding assets, there are already assets in the blockchain, ranging from stocks to who knows an entry ticket to webpage ir whatever. This is, non repeteable digital assets if any type.

well you have an option on sysconfigures or you could create readonly copies or you could create a hash of the rows validating the row contents. read only roles or users, auditing of modifications, there are many options. maybe not as elegant as a blockchain but incredibly more escalable and fast and already working with actually purchased crn erp rh software . also is read only such a feature? i bet very soon blockchain bank users will demand to be able to modify to some extent due to errors or legal protections. Hell in my country i can send a letter to any company and demand they delete any info about ne. I think security is in verifiability, being able to replay a set of transactions and verify that john's account had money and doublespend is not allowed. in fact bitcoin wiki suggests that modified transactions in bitcoin can be simulated moving coins around so at the end they will ask database capabilities with enhanced consensus rules. So what would happen if oracle, ibm, microsoft, or sap create a replicated master master rdbms with user accounts administration, auditing based on multisig so the permissions have to be agreed between many participants? are we getting closer now? i seriously think the main point of bitcoin is a nice degree of resistance to coercion and private blockchains is just a custom database

Simply put: Tyrannosaurus are not gregarious animals, it is going to be damn hard for them. Rebuilding their C O R E  business knowing that depending on what tech or structure they choose (but still with some consensus needed) could leave a bank with huge transformations ahead while somewhat easy for others, legal advantage for some and bad for others, different departamental structures and division changes for one but not for the other, horrible for those with some software and not so bad for others. it is going to be a constant, "sorry i cannot agree on that point, too costly". Naturally big banks will try to get an advantage in the design and small banks won't like that. Regional and country battles, legislation, high sphere politics. It is going to be damn hard. They are going to need some kind of ultra fast ultra fair ultra objective not subject to coercion or blackmail kind of team that agrees on some kind of industry standard, like vhs, betamax, s2000 and we are not talking about a damn videorecorder tape system between 5 conpanies but changing the slowest most regulated dinosaurs in the world upside down. I think bitcoin is the yucatan meteor extinction event. It is like asking the Tyrannosaurus to agree on what kind of hot blooded small mices they want to transform into

There are data protection laws that under requirement from a customer they have to delete every single data at least in europe. They will end after some time with read/write private blockchains err databases.    
Many companies will give total truth to the "blockchain" as the paradigm of infinite truth but they don't know that we have lived aswell the evolution of thousands of alts (with legit and great projects aswell) that used the blockchain idea with some premine or too centralized development that changed the rules after an upgrade or dissappeared with the money.    
The appearence of a truly decentralized, fair blockchain is difficult to replicate and you need many pure actors, and decentralisation at many levels or faith will collapse.    
One bank with more tokens or with more participants on the developer team or that in an unfair way tries to benefit some architecture to minimize the change in their own company. Other bank lobbying to get some advantage in their region, country or market share. 
   
Also has any one migrated a customer database in a huge company? it takes years of preparing by many many departments. And this is about redesigning the whole industry upside down.   
Not sure it will be that easy for non gregarious tyrannosaurus to agree on something at world level.

What's the difference between ripple and ethereum when one judge will ask to have participant info disclosed?    
Only a judicial order to the social address of ethereum foundation will be enough to have them dance in any way they want. Can vitalik be gagged?
Where is bitcoin social address? Can satoshi be gagged?
In last instance when dealing with the power of states or even with those of the UN maybe all the decentralization idea is just a fad? 
 They could say (and it is like that in many countries) that if there is no head, any participant will be made responsible or who knows. .  
All this decentralization idea is like when your country gets invaded and you take your bag and hide in the mountains. But if they want to get you they probably will.
 Bitcoin offers a store of value but should not be based on big security walls but also on game theory. It brings something that under some circumstances could be interesting for any country and like that interesting to be preserved.
That is the problem, that starting trying to store value "money or gold" from the very beginning is attacked by those that prey on money or gold.
Should we have started with the network neutrality offering a neutral ledger (Uncoercible as it is to a certain point) that brings some neutral stuff that everyone values, and the network would have been allowed to thrive.    
What? No clue really, human rights documents, or international legislation or international records.  Some system to record diplomatic or international mercantile agreements. No clue really, just get the point.
      The network would be as secure as now but also it would be protected by game theory and the interests of many to preserve a neutral math TRUTH network and then we could have slowly slowly get in the money matters. We Started instead with a public campaign on 2013 announcing all the banks in the world that they were already dead and that was strategically ridiculous or at least a burden that has only eroded us.   
 Satoshi warned us of not bringing problems to bitcoin with wikileaks and one or two years later very stupidly the community decided to bring against them the biggest power in the planet with infinite money.   
They could have chosen the neutral ledger of truth fist and when they were hooked get into store of value.  I think this slight change in rethoric can still be made. We need Nash game theory and hook the biggest of them so they really appreciate the NEUTRAL nature and they find it useful and want to defend that neutrality at diplomatic stage. No one is defending bitcoin there atm

when/if enough things are invested on bitcoin, armies and governments will fight to defend it. Attacking bitcoin will be considered an attack on the resources of a country. It is already illegal to attack a software network in many countries. Do we have now more than half of the world money invested on weapons defending society? do they even earn a fee for themselves or are they just a liability yet the world accepts that societal anchors have some needed costs? Why countries don't cut internet submarine cables? The response would be as overwhelming as if you close Panama's channel or Ormuz's strait.  it would be too disruptive and the rest of the world would not accept it. (easily). It is world infrastructure.

Ethereum has a social address. A judicial order will be the same as ripple 's case. Vitalik could get a gag order. 
Blockstream also could an order? probably yes but Block stream has a bunch of great devs but bitcoin has hundreds from all over the world.  
Under some jurisdictions if there is not a clear head the holders could be made responsible of all the entity like bitcoin or the dao? Then maybe all the decentralization  idea  is just fog. 
TLDR; ethereum is more similar in the coercible aspect to ripple than bitcoin

i remember internet many years ago. it was a promise of a library with all world knowledge.     
Many utopic users wanted even for it to be another country, a cybernation and they even created an internet manifesto. Those utopic nerds even used to attack those pages that dared to include ads as they wanted to remove poisonous links with the real world.     
   
But slowly, slowly we reached this point. We have a thrilling internet, but it is difficult to find a web or forum where one can just state an opinion without registering themselves and be tracked first, where a politically incorrect opinion on twitter can get someone in jail, where millions, even here in this page do not dare to talk or vote some ideas or thoughts just in case,  where everypage has to display those cookies warnings and html5 allows any browser to be identified uniquely and where all internet is a recopilation, classification panopticon for every search we make, every porn we watch, every thing we do.           
   
A trojan that has brought us mobile devices that track locations, private conversations, private connections and friends, walking habits, our pictures and photos and wifi everywhere that is used as radar of our movements, our thoughts and our statistical inner selfs for credit rating, ad displaying, political afiliation, job application and who knows what else if things get sour with war, anger and hate and what will be used for.

Yeah it would be an iteresting bot if anyone besides sampey knew clearly and properly explained what the different options mean. Trading even through bots is not a gurantee of making money and when you are dealing with a bot with dozens of options that are not clear or detailed you end losing money.     
I got it in the first releases and kept coming many times to try one time more also had long bitcointalk message chats with sampey but at the end, after spending time it always ended on confusion and Lack of detailed examples.      
If sampey took the time to write a detailed and thorough faq or info for every option he would probably do much  better than adding more and more small exchanges.      
Not saying that sampey is not nice or supports customers (absolutely the opposite, he is very nice) but the bot has many options with zero info about them that are simply unintelligible.      
I mean it is a ping pong bot and you get options like "sell when pong &gt;" or "cancel when ping and pong &gt;". And dozens of options like this that you have to test and check in the log to see what they are for.     
Sometimes when you are designing trading models you perform backtests to see how they have gone in the past but here is not possible and the lack of info can make your configuration lose money during many trades until two days later you realize that it was not doing what you thought.       
 
 After experimentation I always ended leaving it parked for later. Some people seems have made a lot of money with it. I just like to know exactly and with a lot of detail what a model is going to do and check backtests to see where is weak, etc.

It is so easy! maybe someone that just happens has been hours waiting for some shit due to the attack.    
And you know hey if we are following all those bullshit government obligations maybe we can try asking them to enforce some of our rights aswell, don't you think?.     
Hey maybe is bullshit and nothing happens but maybe is enough to avoid some FUCKING CRETINS in buttcoin talking openly with their name about attacking for their own financial benefit and causing harm to NORMAL PEOPLE.

Vomitive. 
   
They are just removing civil liberties. The fight against "anything" ended long ago.    
 If politicians  want to remove car accidents ( this is just an example) in a 50% wonderful. If they want to remove 75% wonderful I just want them not to exceed their budget too much. If they want to remove the 90% I think is not going to work unless they expend a incredibly HUGE budget.    
 And with percentiles distribution, if they want to remove the full 100% they would need to remove civil liberties, check every citizen before driving, cameras inside cars, listening conversations inside cars, blood analysis, helmets, limited licenses, etc.  
So when I hear one politician talk about the war against "something" it really means: I Don't really care that the politically correct solution is going to be even worse than the problem itself, with huge intrusions into civil liberties (... because what I really want is the reduction of civil liberties itself and that is just an excuse...). Any strategic and rational planifier spends resources while the cost/benefit is reasonable. The "war" rethoric is I will use ANYTHING.
   Normal guy in the street should know that reducing in a 100% something happening in a population of hundreds of millions is almost impossible ( statistically there can always be one  totally weird situation with a guy driving slowly and he gets hit by a coconut for example) and the 100% enforcement is going to be probably far worse than most problems.    
 Translate all this driving examples int heart diseases, family problems and of couse the 4 cyber apocalypse riders).  
This is just a take over and we are going to be taken in a very politically correct way (that noone will even dare discuss in a family dinner) to a very ugly 100% under control scenario where we won't even be able to say "hi" without enforcement knowing it.   
  
The real war is against civil liberties themselves using politically correct excuse after excuse and nobody will dare to say anything.

I agree. I love technical conversations but I really hate some idiots coming to reddit and start disrupting everything. First the buttcoiners, then the million shorters during the very long 2014, then the hired or who knows shills with interrupting the debate and using Internet community disruption methods. Really at some time I was so damn upset about the disgusting methods every hour that I was close to never come to reddit again.     
Again I think moderation or some degree of control is needed. Not my particular case but even a anarchist debate follows a minimum degree of organization and people is not allowed to vomit or shit in the debate table, alter the votes without people's anger etc. I don't think we are fans of the sex pistols.

so the bitcoin community, their coders, yourself in buttcoin subreddit and youself in magazines call it an attack and you say it is not? Most police departments of developed countries work together and are more than used to many internet attacks, botnets, ddos, etc. And even if the creator of the attack does not have any problem, we have many buttcoiners (many americans probably) trying to promote and organize an attack with the incentive to short and disrupt a legally licensed and insured market. That is illegal and a reddit pseudonym won't hide them. Anyway enough of this conversation. It was just out of curiosity. I think some of those idiots should be more careful or they will get in troubles. Years ago cryptoassets were wild west, exchanges, alt scams, laundering and many more things. this is starting to be less and less the wild west everyday and even if it still appears so, the law goes always some months and years behind but that does not clear from future trouble.

 Recommended pension funds of a money i won't be able to see ever (as many politicians agree on my country that won't be possible to maintain pension funds and they arw even playing with pension money to cover budget holes)?.
 And constant mistakes that always benefit them?
Outrageous constant fees and penalties for every bullshit? (If my grocery acted like that they would not see me again)
 And still having too do many things visiting their office from 9:00 to 15:00 in 2016 due pure incompetent tech approach like if I don't have anything better to do in my life that ask for days off for some bullshit? 
And the money not being mine but a risk asset that I have to pay interest to give as a present so they can exert historically abhorrent usury and lend my own money back to me at outrageous interest and far more outrageous penalties should I fail to have the money just one hour that day?
 To have most of the public  services i have been paying with my taxes with half budget to bailout some banks that took too much risk (and privatized the gains) and see how half of that money goes to bank manager's new carrara marble tile for their swimming pools while hospitals are overcrowded? 
And banks even charging a fee for sending fucking informative email?  
 Give my own money as a present to them so they can corrupt the democracy with lobbies and bullshit?

The whole European Union very soon with their plans for a bitcoin user database, every single bitcoin transaction and people even "asked" to disclose their addresses """voluntarily""" or else. Same as plans to taint bitcoins not approved by the "regime" are being requested in Germany. Those seem to be the plans of the European Union that has a huge percent of the bitcoin user cake worldwide and will very very soon feel the impact of these draconian decisions. 
Legislation through obscurantism regarding bitcoin where users will be cataloged like assassins, thiefs or animals very soon under unfair and unproven reasons. Where users and/or the technology are being shown by the political/banking regime like activists, dealing with any or all of the cyberapocalypse horses even when those accusations are being denied by some agencies. Where people has been requesting dozens of times legal clarification (not only vat) and has not been provided with reasonable response or clarity and at the same time bitcoin users are displayed as money launderers.
Yeah I know that after Brexit the typical sentence is "the eu is not going to last much" but if privacy and fungibiliry are not addressed very fast there will be real people with real problems in those jurisdictions where  governments have not taken the time to do their job and offer a clear legislation *asked many many times*. Miami judge wisely decided a few days ago that governments should at least do more homework if they decide to apply obsolete laws to the bitcoin case.
At this point this lack of privacy or fungibiliry can be even considered risky even at life or death level. We are watching the controlled chaos technique in Europe with tanks in some very very VERY dangerous frontiers. With weekly bombs and killings not seen in many many decades killing hundreds of innocents in the centers of peaceful cities. Social, religious and economic troubles non seen in many decades and what some historians see as 1914 pre WW1 situation. I wonder if Europe will be made again the theater of the Oceania vs Eurasia Churchill described as definitive in the balance for world control. Meanwhile the elite lives their particular hyper housing bubble in new Zealand and Goldman Sachs owns big areas in the southernmost areas if south america. Wonder why.
This might appear ridiculous in this Pokémon go or this world when you go back now to watch TV after reading this but when US had the war with japan the totally constitutional rights of peace period of perfectly lawful Japanese - American citizens were removed. In europe the pacifists were jailed. The rights we have enjoyed during this prosperity period after WW2 are being reduced and are far different from the laws under those same countries now totally bankrupt that look back to their own citizens in order to keep feeding. In this period of systemic turmoil one would do well checking the differences between a peaceful civil code law and the incredibly more rigid and discipline requiring martial law or military code. Don't forget that we have had martial law in France and in US when they were looking for those two guys in a very short recent time.
When things get ugly and things are indeed getting sour in this continent, one call from an influential financier, a banker or someone else might be enough to have a very very close vigilance on those crypto "activists" that are not disciplined enough. Propaganda goes crazy in those situations and it will/could be used to standarize and discipline. Individualism is fought radically in this periods when states fight for their own survival.
Yes, I am worried to some level because what started as a democratic right to defend my property and continue living under my constant learning of computing technologies and to some level allows me to buy some steam games and some vps here and there is being attacked heavily by the cronies at political, social and media level and when things get ugly a General friend is enough to cage hundreds of "suspects" or have them under extreme vigilance and cataloged in a crypto or gay or anarchist or pacifist or whatever database like the one starting in Europe very very soon for Bitcoin.
And those that laugh at this concerns consider that when in a concert, waiting for the luxury of watching and indeed confirming that there is a huge fire in the room can be very risky for your integrity. Waiting for the "War has started" in huge bold characters in your newspaper will put you instantly in the queues with thousands whatever you want to do then. Just watch for those old pictures of Syria with people peacefully walking by with their baby and buying fruits in a beautifully clean and civilized street. Or the elegant German couples enjoying their walk in weimar. Consider than thousands of non extinct animal species are not as clever as we are and they rely on instincts but when they feel there is a lion they wont make laughs or get to first line to confirm it is indeed there, they will instead run like hell. They wouldn't be here otherwise. Also our neurons are there with the only reason to gather some impulses and give back signals for our survival. Maybe we shouldn't easily discard the really important signals in the ultra noisy environment where we are used to live.
 Sometimes when things take years to happen you don't notice them but i think is pretty noticeable how our Europe and our world is very different from that of 2008 and trends usually get totally and absolutely retarded before changing direction. Noone knows that better than us bitcoiners.
In a cleptocracy those that want to protect their assets are criminals. In war the pacifists are criminals. Under pervasive spying those that search privacy are criminals.
I hope bitcoin technology starts to help user's privacy and fungibility issues asap. Seems non important but can be a life/death issue in ugly times. Also, with the new laws coming to Europe it would be sad to lose a continent if we fail to react on time.

That is false beginning from the idea that as soon as you deposit money in the bank it is not yours anymore but a risk asset and should there be any problem in the bank you would be in a long list of creditors. (Reference: G20 october 2014 summit in Brisbane australia)
Regarding the 100.000$ I would really like to see if that is feasible in case of a big problem. Many promised things like that and like pension funds are been used in some countries to fix problems today as the world is drowning in debt.
Besides if they manage to do it is because they are stealing it by other means (printing it, having draconian fees for everything). Now we are in negative interest rates but consider that older generations if they had an average of 2% inflation ( compound) when they reach 80 years old they have been robbed 90% of their money. Ask a 80 year old how much was a chewing gum when he was a kid and how much now and where has that money gone.
During ALL HUMAN HISTORY from Greeks, from those evil Persian guys of the movie 300, romans , Christians, Arabs, Buddhists, middle ages, Jews (between them they cannot, yes to non jews) usury was an ABHORRED FORBIDDEN SIN and not even talking about the concept of inflation or banks just holding 10% of what is deposited. What has gone in our ADVANCED civilization so all damn planet is totally in debt?  (Very interesting read : wikipedia usury)

The world is absolutelly full of parasites and sociopaths taking advantage of the rest of normal individuals. Some studies say that 1/20 individuals is a sociopath.
If Bitcoin (or any other P2P proyect) has to become mainstream and if truly it is the time for a decentralized type of world empowering the individual then some kind of ant-style defense should be created against this parasites or they will derail every single project. Maybe it should even be added to the blockchain on a decentralized not defeatable model. Think about coinvalidation project or the egoistic miner attack. Bitcoin needs some kind of defense as a mass.
One weak individual won't be able to withstand the harm of some parasites and just waiting for a chaotic group of individuals to autoorganize themselves after every single attack and react to an impending attack could bring a huge advantage to the egoistical attacker, meaning even the death of the mass of individuals (project). 
The creation of a fast response site or network or just a place to go and ask for the intelligent reaction as a group against a egoistical attack could mean the difference between survival or not for many P2P projects. 
Being a mass (P2P) does not mean that we are stupid. Bitcon needs some kind of ant-style p2p defense against egoistic or parasitical individuals. That might not grant some p2p projects survival but will increase our possibilities.

Politicians love power over the rest. Money is one of their tools and bitcoin is not as controllable as their own toy currency. It might happen but not with the help of greedy politicians.

So this is a superhero convention and spiderman, bernanke and this human wonder we have here posting were talking
Spiderman says 'I can climb walls withou problem'
Bernanke says 'that is nothing I can print infinite money and give it to my friends'
And here comes this one and says 'that is nothing I can increase or debase the money value as I or my friends desire. Do you think you have a gold coin? Wrong, I can make it a paper coin, not only is not worth anything but you can even have to pay a fine. Now that is a superpower'

Bitcoin is not claiming anything, because does not talk. Bitcoin is a protocol, a programmable protocol. You can have bitcoins (like coins at the moment and that is a currency), but the Bitcoin protocol is a protocol.
It is a rarety that is saving thousand of argentinians, cypriots, spaniards and many other countries from being robbed by bankers like you. 
But still, seriously i don't want to talk to you. So let me see. You bankers create the greatest fraud of all times, billions slaved during history for your own good. People creates Bitcoin and not only you come here to make a profit of it investing on it because it is growing, but you also has the face to appear here to discourage others.
Please don't answer i don't want to keep talking to you.

That is a lie. The real objective is to rob your coins. So yo think your coins now are 400 bucks on mtgox? Wrong. Those are only for clean ones and there might be just a few of those. Exactly the coins of this subject's friend.
This is the very beginning of the new federal reserve system just that is not about infinite paper money but about infinite laundry ability that is how it will work they will reclean coins infinitely and this individual talking here will benefit greatly from it. Everybody thank the new genius!

Oh so Bitcoin should be 1/2 of let me see a company with 4 Billion capitalization -&gt; Mercado Libre Incorporated !!!!! Oh wonderful So with bitcoin i can send money everywhere in the world, i can store millions on my brain and cross frontiers dressed with a tanga, it has more programatic possibilities than facebook or twitter but so you say that it CAN only have 1/2  of the capitalization of Mercado Libre Inc. A wonderful Argentinian based company about e-commercing. So half Argentinians are dyeing to buy bitcoins to store their wealth, but Bitcoin should have 1/2 of an e-commerce company capitalization. And we are just talking about Argentinia, not about Bitcoin all over the world. I don't get it.

The point that China makes here about a currency disconnected from individual nations is due to the "Triffin Dilemma"  or Triffin Paradox
"...The Triffin dilemma or paradox is the conflict of economic interests that arises between short-term domestic and long-term international objectives when a national currency also serves as a world reserve currency("store of value" currency (out of four functions of money) The dilemma of choosing between these objectives was first identified in the 1960s by Belgian-American economist Robert Triffin. He pointed out that the country whose currency, being the global reserve currency, foreign nations wish to hold, must be willing to supply the world with an extra supply of its currency to fulfill world demand for these foreign exchange reserves, and thus cause a trade deficit...."
This might be the principal reason of US trade deficit and one that any new internation reserve currency will have to suffer if it is the currency of a country at the same time. 
Bitcoin anyone?

If this helps you I had the very exact same problem some months ago also with tormail I had to send them many emails and after a lot of verification data involving ip and documentation and information about last trades and the bitcoins I had we solved it. I dont recommend anyone to hold their money in one exchange but 3 different (apart from cold storage). Bitcoin exchanges are not insured, are not as professional like other services outside bitcoin world and many times are like a candy for hackers. Good luck and dont give up

Here is another one, so Bitcoin should not be, on the actual world of ASSASSIN AND THIEF BANKERS be valued more than 1/4th the total of the game company Electronic Arts. The whole world will profit much more playing with The Sims III than with the store of value and transfer capabilities of Bitcoin all over the world? If i were a banker i could probably be playing The Sims III without any risk of having my head chopped off like some Mexicans or the hundreds of suicides in Greece or other places during the crisis (oh they cannot play anymore) but for the rest that are not BANKERS LIKE YOU we prefer to have BITCOIN as a hedge against that and we value its possibilities more than Electronic Arts "The Sims". It seems that for Bankers, is not that important that the 99% of the population are being played on a simulation game, of course, they are who are managing the rest of us
@_date: 2013-11-13 01:21:13
Ok so actual Bitcoin should have a lower total capitalization than:
1/4 or the wonderful game company Electronic Arts
1/2 of Mercado Libre Incorporated (Argentinian e-commerce company)
Same size as Dominos Pizza UK
1 Mudanjiang Hengfeng Paper Co (wonderful company that manufacture paper for cigaretts)
1 Kokusai chart corporation (another company that manufactures ribbon cassettes, and recording pen cartridges)
Well you get the idea..
So in this world of banksters and robbers where there is no place to put your money with permanent and skyrocketing inflation the total capitalization of Bitcon shouldn't be higher than 1/4 of Electronic Arts, something like for example the capitalization of The Sim III Game, is that correct? Not sure i agree with that, i think Bitcoin offers a little bit more to the world than Dominos Pizza UK

I read newspaper, i read text books, watch documentaries, watch interviews from economists, read the IMF and ECB reports,  and many other media to keep me informed. 
Interest + Reserve System + Fiat money is a recipe for big problems and we are living it every few years already. Bitcoin at least is finite, although it can be included in debt markets (with interests) and exchanges can use reserve system (they probably do it to some extent).
 (this is a nice article about it from mises.org and it avoids you the horrible idea of watching a documentary, oh god)

hello, some time ago i forgot the exact passphrase for one of my brainwallets. I have created a script that makes combinations but atm is quite slow so it will take ages. The passphrase has 252 characters in total 8 of them are numbers. I  am really sure about the phrase and about the exact numbers but i wonder if i used an accent or a comma here or there. In my language the correct commas or accents  positions are limited so combinations are high but not that high. What do you think?

I am not talking about 2008, i am talking about "The Creature of Jeckyll Island" and how you have ruined your own country with your central Bank. I am talking about living for hundreds of years on the lie and the extorsion of debt + interest. People is living and dying only to pay your debt based on air (+ interests on the air of course). There are wars, there are holocausts based on that lie. The same world ecosystem is dyeing because of that lie.
You bankers are in a real bubble. You are worse than dogs. I really cannot believe how can you still appear in front of any other human being saying that you are a "banker". SHAME.
@_date: 2013-11-13 02:15:18
I am talking about bankers, about how they create the money based on debt from the thin air, add to that an interest (from something that is not real) and that debt creation added to the actual fiat system creates bubble after bubble after bubble. 
I suggest you to view "Hidden secrets of Money" documentary from Mike Maloney from whygoldandsilver or many others, just search for history of money documentary on youtube. Normally they leave the "creation of money part" out of eduction on university
That problem is what Bitcoin wants to address, it is a protocol, it is starting but it is the root to eliminate something really rotten in our civilization that is hurting us as society but also the entire planet earth, because the planet resources are limited and we cannot sustain a bubble after bubble infinite model. Unless the 90% of population is removed from the globe, that would give a nice time for the other 10%, that is ofc another option to continue like now.

ok and email protocol is backed up by? and tcp/ip protocol? how much is behind backing up internet protocols? So an internet protocol that is a revolution because provides a ledger -(that before did not exist) and that the chief architect of IBM says that is astonishing and that they are going to use similars for their products- p2p and virtually unbreakable. Or the ability to send money everywhere almost instantly or to cross frontiers totally nude with all your money. So all that is not valued at even the capitalization price of a paper cigarrette company in china (i have been checking capitalizations on google finance)?? I still don't get it. You might be a banker but i am a technologist and i see a revolutionizing technology as soon as i see it (like IBM chief architect does aswell). I saw the power to change of computers on the 80s and i have forecasted "humbly" and at least "a good future" for most of the rising technologies in the last 20 years. 
Bitcoin will grow, it is not just the money, it is a public ledger where you can proof things like a notary, it is also programmable, and it is highly resistant, like the internet itself because it is a protocol and i say that it will grow but that now, at least is much higher than a paper cigarette company in china or than Dominos pizza UK capitalization, specially after the need for a good store of value after cyprus events and the new October 13th "Taxing Times" pdf document by the IMF. 
Look for a good store of value because we are going to need it. Oh sorry, you don't need any, you are a banker. But the rest of the world yes.

g accounts related with bitcoin just today. Their intentions are bad that is for sure just trying to limit bitcoin growth. Bitcoin is a technology not a stock or just a currency and will follow a technology adoption s curve like radio telephone or mobiles followed it.
