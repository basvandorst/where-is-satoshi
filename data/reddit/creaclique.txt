I understand. If I may ask, what to you mean when you say " it could be hard to sell them " ? The process of buying/selling is not simple for crypto-currencies?

Yeah, I understand that bitcoin has a good potential, but the problem for me, is that a can buy stocks far cheaper than bitcoin and with an egal potential.

Oh ok I understand. Thank you again for all this information. It's really valuable for a beginner like me.

Thanks to you for pointing this out.

What really changes things for me here  is that I didnt know that it wad possible to buy a fraction of bitcoin. I'm not even sure to know how it works to be honest. 
Thank you for your advice and yeah, the problem is that I am really good at the stock market, but I've been investing for the last ten years. I don't know **** about crypto-currencies sadly. That's why I'm here. 
Thanks again !

I totally agree with you. Maybe my sentences structure was not clear, english is not my native language. What I meant is, in the stock market, buying penny stock is more risky, but can be more profitable, because if you compare the volatility of the shares of an unknown and obscur company of Oregon to Netflix, it is basically sure, that the Oregons company's stock will move much more. The fact is, that with my 100k, I can only buy a small amount of Netflix shares, and a lot of the Oregons company. Of course, its even better when you take into account the dividend. 
So for the crypto-speculation, what I meant was that it's seems like the other crypto-currencies have much more chances of improving their value of, for example, 50% than bitcoin. Maybe I'm wrong, but I'm not here to be right, I'm here to learn. 
Thank you for your reply, it helped me rethink my positions about penny investment.
