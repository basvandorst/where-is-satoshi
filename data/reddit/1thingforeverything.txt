Well, your fault for listing Litecoin, screams like scam. you should have stayed at Bitcoin, it will be the one succeeding anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:55:55
well yeah, but we only need one crypto for business and that is Bitcoin. Just the fact you list those stupid other coins makes me think ou are some sort of scamsite. USD is not the future, but Litecoin is no future either and so is every other one. Also If I set that site as homescreen I can see the menu "coins" on the top already and I have to puke.
Why would anyone want those stupid alternatives if we have the best coin already?
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:06:16
Those are desperate people from or altcoin-subreddits. They realize that Bitcoin is the only crptocurrency needed and are now coming to cry here.
Honestly, look at those people wasting their money on scams, lacking the insight that only Bitcoin can succeed.
That is why they have now decided to give up. Bitcoin is the only one true choice, concentrate on Bitcoin and the future is bright, every other coin drains Bitcoins success and must be destroyed with any method possible (except killing or torture).
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:29:06
Bitcoin was first and only choice for a currency.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:17:37
Yeah, how about removing Litecoin and altcoins and make it a proper Bitcoin only priceindex? Who cares about those fluctuating shitcoins?
The have no future and fluctuate 50% per day, why do you even waste resources on those scams?
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:56:14
wow, another scam? bitcoin is the only solution, this is more shit than the already shitcoin Litecoin. That association is now riding that pumpanddump train as well, huh? Very dissapointed, they should concentrate ONLY on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:30:01
I hope not, Litecoin is a scam made by some chinese people just to pump and dump. Do you really wish to support things like that, i had to pukle when i saw this great product for Bitcoin had a stretchgoal for any other coin, ALMOST made me not contribute, horrible. I will now revoke my funding so that the stretchgoal is not reached!
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:28:46
OF COURSE they do. Those altcoiners have no relevance, come back in a year and see how Bitcoin will dominate everything. Every coin tries so desperately to question the future only Bitcoin can achieve.
We need o put a stop to those scams and make them disappear, no one needs them and they drain Bitcoins success.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:49:14
enjoy loosing hundreds of customers, because you support cryptos other than Bitcoin. Your own fault, hope you regret it in a year when bitcoin overtook everything.
@_date: 2014-07-09 13:44:05
yeah the heard of that memecoin with the dog, then the went to other scams and finally realized there is something great like Bitcoin. Look at those fools, look how quickly the storm on this subredit just to be part of something big.
The price is tanking, JUST BECUASE those fools are supporting Litecoin or altcoins, we really need to kill those stupid scams. I bet our are paid by some altcoinassciation to defend them
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:44:08
OK STOP FUNDING UNTIL IT IS RELEASED. Litecoin support is a stretch goal, dont support other coins besides Bitcoin, they are run by people ripping you off.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:18:41
still, dont even mention those scams, total rippoff. If you think they can succeed against bitcoin, you are false. come back in a year and bitcoin will be the only relevant figure.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:04:35
yeah, the other coins have no use, shitcoins.
@_date: 2014-07-09 14:39:04
wow that was clearly an ironic statement, you just want to defend your stupid scams. whatever dude, you will regret it in a year, i am sure.
@_date: 2014-07-08 18:12:14
WOW someone trying to sell us litecoin again? I really cant trust your business, for taking things like Litecoin and even that memecoin.
Just take the one currency, we all need, Bitcoin. No one needs those litecoins, memecoins and altcoins. They all just pump and dump and steal from Bitcoin and if you support that I will not support you!
@_date: 2014-07-08 23:11:44
Hell yeah, we need to concentrate all on Bitcoin. Dont support scams like Litecoin or altcoins, they are all small babel-towers, which will be crushed by the traditional system.
If you support any other currencies besides Bitcoin, you are doomed to fail. Dont trust anyone accepting anything other than Bitcoin. Those people are likely to try to sell you those failed and damaged strings of bits.
This man knows the truth, there is only one Currency for the Future and that is Bitcoin. Everything else is already dead!
