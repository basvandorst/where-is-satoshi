Ok, because you genuinely seem to want to learn, I'll explain it.
Home prices shot up in part because there's a limited amount of land in prime development locations, and part because the home mortgage interest deduction encourages the purchase of houses as investments.  It also encourages the construction of McMansion-style houses that have a lot of perceived value.  Also, houses are often not seized in bankruptcy cases, and provide other financial benefits.
You're also generalizing lending WAY too much.  Having a flexible money supply is very important for a functioning economy.  There used to be bank runs regularly, when we were on the gold standard, and eventually, there was a global bank run, known as the Great Depression.  You're only familiar with the economic problems that happened during your lifetime, but they were nothing compared to the Great Depression.  It was so awful that we collectively agreed to redesign the entire global financial system so it wouldn't happen again.
All the problems you've mentioned with debt are caused by allowing irresponsible people to take out larger loans than they can ever hope to pay back, and then figuring out a way to get someone else to take on the risk of those loans.  However, responsible borrowers often need to take out large loans too.  You know how the federal government bailed out the banks and the auto industry during the recession?  Did you know that those were loans that had to be paid back with interest?  And that the government actually made billions of dollars on those loans?  They were only possible because we have a flexible money supply.
Also, in a deflationary economy, imports become far cheaper, and exports become harder to sell.  People end up just importing everything they need rather than get anything made locally.  Local production also becomes impossible.  Need a factory built?  That might take $5 million and three years.  Do you have that money up front?  If not, anyone investing in your factory would need to be fairly certain that their investment would pay off more than just sitting on their currency would.  And nobody would probably think that, because in a deflationary economy present money is more valuable than future goods.  Deflation is fine if you have a lot of money.  The rich get richer without even trying.  But it sucks if you're anyone else.

Here's a recent one:
And another:
Took me about two seconds with Google.
The 4% figure was using an earlier value I'd calculated, based on the assumption that 100% of Mt. Gox BTC would be distributed among depositors, which seems very likely.  It's something like 1.5% based on current BTC valuation.  But it's still 15% of the amount of initial calculated liabilities, which given recent developments, is still very low.

If you just sell them to pay expenses as they come up, then taxes are minimal.
You can also trade them for drugs.  Then you don't have to pay any taxes.

It doesn't help that news articles always show bitcoins as though they were actual, physical coins.  I guess they need SOMETHING to show in a picture, but why does it always have to be those stupid novelty coins?  Pretty sure those have QR codes on the backs of them, and if the general public got ahold of them, the first thing they'd do is probably take a picture of the QR code and put it on facebook... all that money lost in an instant.

The point is, investment doesn't make any sense if you have a deflationary currency.  Because you're better off just sitting on the currency.

If you took out a loan for 100 BTC five years ago, you'd still be screwed even if there was 0% interest on that loan.  That's why deflation is considered bad.  Also, investments are a type of loan, and a deflationary currency makes investment very unlikely.
Deflation is a problem when economies grow faster than money supply.  It's the main thing that caused the Great Depression, since at the time, the value of a dollar was linked to the price of gold.  That's why virtually all currencies today maintain low, predictable inflation.  So that sitting on cash isn't in anyone's interest.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:49:02
USD is just fine.  We need a currency that it's possible to take loans out in, after all.  Imagine how stupid it'd be to take out a loan denominated in BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:29:51
Yeah, because they were too weak and were barely able to do anything during that time period.  Not to mention, they were still hamstrung by the gold standard.

"Pennies on the dollar".  So say, for 4% of their claim.  Meaning four cents for every dollar, which in physical cash, consists of four pennies.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:29:31
Okay, that's an old figure.  New figure is more like 15%.  Still 15 cents on the dollar is crazy, considering that it looks like any Mt. Gox creditors with BTC balances are standing to gain much more than the value of their claims.  BTC claims under CR would be worth about ten times their appraised value at today's prices.  Meaning a hedge fund paying 15% of the claim's appraised value wouldn't even be paying multiple pennies on the dollar at that rate.  This makes a lot of assumptions, I realize, but in any case there are very few scenarios where the hedge funds could possibly lose.

Typically, it's based on the decade you were born in.  WWII - 1959 = baby boomer.  1960 - 1979 = Gen X.  1980 - 1999 = Millennial, so named because we reached adulthood during the new millennium.
I sort of consider college to be an extension of childhood, so anyone that's first found themselves needing to support themselves or a family after Clinton was president would have a lot in common with that generation.
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:42:13
Heh.  Sure, if you want to.
I bought into BTC as an investment once it weathered its first bubble intact.  It was about $10 at the time.  I considered the possibility that people who learned about BTC by buying weed and LSD online might end up being millionaires as a result.
Interesting times we live in.

If you took an uber to work every day for your commute, you'd find out quick that it's a lot cheaper to own a car.  So that's horseshit.
Amazon and eBay and the like are nice.  They hardly employ anyone and make their shareholders gazillions of dollars, but they sure are convenient.
The point is, back then everything was less efficient.  And as a result, more people were employed.  These days, things are more efficient, and as a result there is lower demand for labor.  When baby boomers were hitting their adulthood, only people who were disabled or incredibly lazy couldn't find work.  These days, finding work is significantly harder.  But I guess the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.

Reality doesn't use anecdotal evidence as evidence, and is understandable mainly through statistics.  I suspect that among the various generations, 90% of baby boomers had an easy time entering the work force, 80% of gen-xers had an easy time entering the workforce, and 60% of millennials had an easy time entering the workforce. Baby boomers had it especially easy, it was somewhat harder for the next generation, and millennials have had it especially hard. And yet, most people of every generation had an easy time entering the workforce.  So all of these assertions being made can *simultaneously be correct* without contradicting each other.
Sure, it's easier to start a business than ever, but mostly only if you have a set of skills that are high in demand.  And if you have a disability or mental illness, you can probably forget about that, even if you *do* have one of those skills.
re: Uber.  It's basically just a slightly-cheaper, more convenient taxi.  It really doesn't change much for anyone but taxi drivers.  Few people are able to do much with Uber that they couldn't before just by taking taxis everywhere.

Even if something breaks, bitcoin would just go on hold temporarily, the blockchain would rewind a few blocks, and business would continue as it did before.  If it meant the end of their livelihoods, you can bet that bitcoin miners would be okay with patching the main BTC code, and all migrating at once.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:42:10
I get it.  You're like the Ben Carson of Bitcoin.  Because you've had some success, you think you understand economics better than all the economists who wrote it off initially.
Why do you think technology is deflationary?  If I buy a laptop, its value drops quite a lot over time.  Because you can buy better goods for less money?  Maybe, but you still have to spend the money to remain in the market, and meanwhile whatever the last thing you bought was is probably worth next to nothing.

Just had to add my gratitude for speaking up against the rising tide of bullshit.  You may even have enlightened him.  It was clear as day from his original post that this guy was born long before 1980, because nobody born afterwards would have said that.
Reality doesn't give two shits about anecdotal evidence, and tends to be understandable mainly though statistics.  If 90% of baby boomers had an easy time entering the work force, 80% of gen-xers had an easy time entering the workforce, and 60% of millennials had an easy time entering the workforce, *practically every single thing said on this page would be true*.  Baby boomers had it especially easy, it was somewhat harder for the next generation, and millennials have had it especially hard.  And yet, most people of every generation had an easy time entering the workforce.  Those are just educated guesses, but I suspect they're not far off.  
I, like OP, believed in bitcoin when I learned of it.  The main difference between us is that I had to use a credit card to buy $500 worth, unlike OP who probably was able to actually invest savings.  I bet that when bitcoin price rises, the distance between him and I grows much faster than the distance between me and nothing.

Now that hedge funds are in the BTC day-trading game, we can probably count on the US Republican party to defend BTC tooth and nail.  And Democrats don't show any signs of being against it, so the US seems like a safe haven for the time being.
I understand your point, but it seems about as likely as all BTC miners giving up at once, in this political climate.

I tried to convince everyone I knew to buy at $15.  Nobody could understand what they were, and the few that did, assumed they'd be made illegal because they were mainly being used to buy drugs at the time.  Or people thought that buying them would make the government suspicious that they were using them to buy drugs.
Had one person take my advice, but didn't buy in until $140 or so.  Coins are caught in Mt. Gox fiasco, but with the impending civil rehabilitation decision, it seems that even if we only get 20% of the BTC we had in the exchange, it'll be around 5x our claim.

What's the most impressive, is that Bitcoins have actually increased in value over the past year faster than my ability to spend them has.  So from an initial deposit of a few hundred dollars, I got almost a year's worth of recreational drugs and a few thousand dollars worth of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:58:38
This is what I've been considering doing (buying more BTC with cash and spending them) but my past methods for putting money in my Mt. Gox account no longer seem to work.  I'll figure it out at some point, I'm sure.
