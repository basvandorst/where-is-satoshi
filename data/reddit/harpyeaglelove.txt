r/sanctionedsuicide if you don't get that money out.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:23:12
Honestly, I might kill myself if  I were in your shoes for being so stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:35
jesus, you might want to consider r/sanctionedsuicide.
I'd be shitting bricks if I were you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:40:57
wrong.  All that matters is money.  Fuck grades, money is all that matters.
You done gone fucked up big time.
I would suggest stop focusing on grades and focus on making and investing money.
Good luck, I hope you learned your lesson.

The house wouldn't be gone, he just would have crap credit and a loan he'd have to pay off.

Might want to start selling when you see articles like this in the mainstream media.  Once the mainstream becomes aware of this rocket, it's going to get heavy very quickly and you know which direction it goes at that point.
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:30:37
Yeah, they've lost a shitload of money.

Seems odd to me that the big banks are working on a separate block chain technology that is not open to the public?
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:57:21
Yeah, no.

How many people own gold and silver?
@_date: 2017-04-08 06:43:48
This is just wrong...gold is literally the definition of a store of value.  You people are fucking crazy in the bitcoin world.

Bitcoin is crashing back down to 5k or lower, OP will most likely commit suicide around 4-5k, or if it drops to 1k, OP will probably have already killed himself.

You're on the wrong forum, this belongs on r/wallstreetbets.

I hate to say it buddy, but if you have a mortgage you don't own shit.
You just liquidated an appreciating asset for one in a bubble, that you don't even own anyways.
Sorry to be an asshole, but you didn't buy anything other than debt to a bank....buying a house = paying in full.
Correct title:  got a mortgage using some of my bitcoin profits.

Just wait, this is just the beginning - as cryptos gain popularity so will the control over these transactions.  It would be wise to take some profits now at this high level just as a token of caution for a possible heavy hand of the government in the future.
Governments may not be able to stop bitcoin, but they sure can make it very uncomfortable to use this alternative currency for practical purposes.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:32:47
lmao sell now and cut your losses, price is going down bigtime.

Silver and gold premiums are as high as 15%.  An American Silver eagle is roughly $20, which represents a 14% premium.
If you buy Junk silver from APMEX it's still a roughly 10-15% premium, even if you spend $1400 on a bag...
Gold premiums are MUCH lower - you spend roughly $25-60 over spot for a one ounce gold coin which represents a roughly 4% premium.
One must consider that if you buy fractional ounces of gold, you spend MUCH more than 4% and approach the 10-20% premiums that silver tends to share.
If you want to buy generic silver bars, you spend considerably less, and usually get it for less than $1 over spot if you find the right seller, which represents roughly 5% or less.
So bitcoin premiums aren't so absurd in comparison.
TLDR:  Commonly sought after silver has 10-20% premiums, especially if you go to a local coin shop for purchase, or APMEX etc.  Gold can have 4% or lower premiums if you choose 1 ounce, but can be 15% if you buy fractional coins.

....you're trying to tell you me you own nearly a million dollars worth of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:13:33
My guess:  It's going to pass.  All these babyboomers missed the boat on cryptocurrencies and are butthurt - they missed out on 50,000% gains.  You think they're just going to let that slide?   Moreover, bitcoin has made a lot of very creepy motherfuckers very rich overnight - most of the original people who used cryptos were legit online criminals...who are now filthy rich, and some of those people are terrorists.  Some terrorist hacker who immigrated to this country from Somalia who bought $1743 worth of bitcoin back in 2011 is now a multi, multi millionare who has all that cash at his disposal to kill Americans on American soil.  You think they don't know this already?  
Not only is this going to pass but they're probably going to edit the bill to make more sweeping legislation against bitcoin and other crytocurrencies, especially the exchanges:
My advice:  Sell at least what you are not wiling to lose at this point.  Begin the transfer process to your bank, this can take many weeks to months if your exchange sucks and locks your account or if your bank sucks - so start the process now.   This could get VERY ugly for cryptocurrencies very quickly, especially if this bill gets some major traction - you could see huge losses pile up very quickly and you can even see issues with the exchanges themselves...
