I'm not too aware about exchanges. I own bitcoins in a shell, out of the "wild world". As I see, there are increasing number of exchanges that are adopting SegWit. Simply, seaarch for them (in this forum, i.a.)
Follow the capitalist rules: if A provide a flaw-full service, try B or C.

Why not? bitcoin-cli is the only software I trust.

I'm vorting negative all those childish memes I see. They contribute only with noise.

I'm fed up of these childish memes. No real valuable contribution on them. Please use twitter instead. You'll have my negative for sure.

That exactly applies to ECDSA.
The supposed lack of verification performance of ECDSA is the inversion of `s` parameter. But the signer can provide rightly `1/s` instead of `s` without performance leak.
The only difference I guess is the multi-sig. But I still have to understand it.

What performance advantages brings Schnorr signatures against ECDSA?
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:52:17
I'm still working on "multi-sig" concept and how it realizes mathematically in Schnorr scheme.

What about creating a new forum page based on [discourse]( the system used by stackoverflow?
It seems easier for users than phpBB &amp; clones. But I'm not sure about security issues.

Don't tempt me! :-)
