Less room for jokes there because late stage socialism equates to starvation and death.

Banks and their deep pockets would never allow it.

Agreed. I think a maximum amount of cryptocurrency for the portfolio is 20 percent if you're really aggressive. Personally, I'm at about 2.5 percent and I would like to get to 10.

Listen, sorry to be a dick but it's pretty common that friends and family ask you for loans when they hear you have money. I'm glad your friends didn't, but I've seen it all the time in the high six/seven figure income club. 
Maybe you're a 8 or 9 figure guy and your friends are different, but OP is unlikely to be in your ballpark.
I'll never call anyone out unless they do first. Certainly not adhered to by everyone, but a good general rule on this site.  
Also, there is general skepticism about billion dollar boasts, but I'll leave that be.

I come with the perspective of a high net worth individual more so than a cryptocurrency enthusiast.
~1.5 m is certainly a lot of money, but it's obviously not enough for a lifetime for most people.
My general thoughts:
1) Diversify. I'm in the minority here, but I think some more tangible assets would be a good idea. There are no "great buys" around but some income real estate or a few hundred thousand in blue chip stocks with dividends would be a good hedge.
2) Pay off debts, possibly with the exception of your house because of the mortgage tax exception.
3) Protect. Umbrella insurance, an asset protection trust from Nevada or Alaska. A family trust/will in case something happens to you.
4) You're not a bank. If anyone finds out, you'll be asked for loans from everyone. Don't lend money you're not willing to lose.
5) Continue. Keep your job, live your life.

My brother in law was shorting on margin circa 2010.  When he got trapped in margin calls for money that he only "needed for a week"
My lovely wife lent $350,000 to them over a few months.
My medical practice was starting to take off at the time, so I had a good income, but obviously that was a lot. Plus, think of the opportunity cost.
I got about $200k back over the past 7 years, but payments are getting less frequent.
Recently, this guy tells me that his mining operation has gotten him about 9 btc over the past few years.
I'm thinking, hand that over and about 25 more, and now we're done with the principal.
A sad, but common life lesson: If you lend a family or friend money, be prepared to never get it back.

Fair enough. Have a good evening.

Good for you and your superior friends.

Skill based prize money isn't earned income?

You've probably never been a financial success before. Trust me, this happens. It's ruined relationships with family and friends

I could be wrong, but I think the cryptocurrency crowd isn't looking to be middle class. 
Besides, like I said earlier, this is written from a perspective of a high net worth individual. If I were taking to 65 year old retried firefighters, my message would be different.

I think most people will assume you're a Minecraft player.

I have friends who employ their children as "models" who fund the maximum of 5k and change.
But I think a talent based competition would be subject to rules regarding earned income. For example, what would a prize fighter categorize his income as?

I'm appropriately scared of anything that has increased 10x in one year. But a 1 percent diversification of all my assets into this probably isn't a bad idea.

I love cryptocurrency, but consider putting it in her Roth IRA for tax free growth.

Part of the problem is that there are very few places to invest these days because money is still very cheap. Stocks have ridiculously high P/E these days, commodities are high as is real estate. 
In other words, speculators have very few places to pour their money into.  Now the big guys have started to take notice, the bubble will continue to inflate.

Just to think, I bought one for $500 a year ago. When should I jump back on this bandwagon?
