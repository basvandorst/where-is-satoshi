I couldn't access earlier, but just now re-tried and their website is up again. Server must have been down then.

Yeah, that's been my observation too, and with my native language too. It just burns my eyes when I see someone putting "your" and "should of, would of" etc. :)

This person is unable to spell to save his life, I don't think there is anything you need be worried about.

Hopefully, but too optimistic, take into account all "experts" and such they're hiring for this process.
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:37:04
Yeah, I use cryptsy as well.

I wouldn't keep your holdings in btc-e if I were you, especially in light of Russian news.

But isn't it a temporary happiness? I am sad as well by the way.
So what I mean is if you plug your iPhone for a new iOS update or sync, isn't that app automatically deleted? Not totally certain how that works.

Mac OS is based on debian, in case you have not heard.
"OS X is based upon the Mach kernel. Certain parts from FreeBSD's and NetBSD's implementation of Unix were incorporated in NeXTSTEP" — src.

These are Russians after all :) and this is coming from Russian, trust me it's good enough :)
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:11:57
No, did not know that...
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:11:10
Didn't realise they were not legally in Russia.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:44:00
At least they didn't put facebook or twitter in there. Although instapaper or evernote is clearly way out there for the question.

It is, probably 3 days old. Nothing really changed from old content, they just split it into PDFs.

Take one day at a time. There isn't an official statement. Like someone said in the other thread. Maybe some investor will come forward and bail them out. Don't rush into conclusions based on... nothing yet. Yeah things aren't good, but nobody told you yet your holdings are gone apart from reddit trolls and clowns. Many in the same boat, and still maybe foolishly maybe not holding some 0.0000001% hope for some relief.
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:43:34
Just check their twitter ( on all official status updates.

I never claimed it was not proprietary. It's linuxy enough for me despite that yeah I prefer ubuntu. I am just saying that it's already where it should be, Mac is closed source. Whatever they've got now is working fantastic.

I asked her two questions, quoting by memory:
1. Can BTC or Dollars be returned ever?
A: "I am not sure if they can, but if they can it will not be full amount it will be a portion of it, but it all depends on results of a civil case”.
2. What should I do in the meantime?
A: “Keep checking mtgox regularly as the announcement will be published, again pending civil case, as the process of proof of customers will begin where customers will have to contact mtgox and they will rerun all books as to who had what on their balances on mtgox”.

Check into a thing called paper wallet: 
Some people go out of the way to do it completely offline, on USB booted machine from live CD that is not altered in any way.

Sounds like you suffered hysteria attack. Feel better mate.
@_date: 2014-02-20 02:36:17
I am not a native speaker, and since i spent so many years learning English these things are more screaming to me than to native speakers. In my observations, I have only seen Americans type like this "you really should of taken". So this has got to be a native speaker who obviously appears to be a retarded once you see the way he writes.
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:10:17
Hat off to you mate; I kind of want to do same thing as you did!
@_date: 2014-02-19 05:49:39
And how exactly are they supposed to invite mtgox "exiles" when the latter cannot withdraw BTC? So they're essentially inviting those who do not exist in large numbers. They're inviting ghosts. Nice. Wouldn't one expect all these flamers wait for mtgox to allow unlucky people to withdraw before proceeding with their marketing attempts?
