Thanks!  I'll chuck them an email
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:58:23
I'm interested in hearing your rebuttal
@_date: 2013-06-14 00:20:35
Fixed? 
@_date: 2013-05-17 02:01:28
Of course! And that's the 2012 hint coming in. I think my lat/long were a bit off so I was looking at the Gaza Strip :/

I'm not sure of the rules of this subreddit but this seems like spam
@_date: 2013-05-17 01:48:07
Ahh I was stuck on 6. Couldn't work out what 2012 had to do with it until I realised that clue was for a different chest. What was it?

When you say they're not difficult to obtain, what you really mean is they're not difficult to obtain IN THE US.
In Australia we have two reputable sites to exchange on, and they both charge at least 7% on all exchanges

I don't have enough invested to be too concerned, but always interested in the motivations (if any) behind price dips like this
@_date: 2013-06-14 00:50:44
You only need that if you want a reply to your comment I think. No message though so I'll try it again
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:07:23
No I don't work anywhere near a bank so I'm going to have to wait until I can get away, preferably when the price isn't fluctuating wildly. Hanging out for lower prices too. Did you get any? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:52:47
Yup, thanks! 
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:08:31
Do you think I should wait a few days? 
@_date: 2013-06-14 00:51:17
Thanks! +5mbtc
@_date: 2013-06-25 04:27:46
I've used them too and I have to say the fact that I can get the money without physically going into a bank is a huge plus for someone who works full time but not near a bank
@_date: 2013-05-31 04:16:43
Sounds like you've done the right thing, I might look into buying another gpu. Thanks for the chat and if there's a brisbane meetup I'll be sure to see you there

Edit- I think that's right, just some coins I had given to me from an unknown source.
My plan is also to hold onto them for a while now that I have some disposable income to play around with

Not sure about the golden key bit but your symbols should have been Z57wyegodrkq
Or at least that's what I had
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:13:29
I waited and I'm glad I did
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:48:38
How does getting cash out of it work? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:43:44
Well I've now mined .01 btc aww yeahhh
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:40:04
How do you find it as an exchange? Or do you buy bitcoins with it then transfer to a different exchange? 
@_date: 2013-05-31 02:17:22
Ah cool, what's your plan when difficulty goes up with it's not profitable?
@_date: 2013-06-13 23:13:16
On my phone so can't read it, but was there anything that would make the price drop like that? 
@_date: 2013-05-31 01:16:01
How much do you get in a week? I have a gaming rig that I mine with about 80% of the time and get a bit under .1 btc a week
