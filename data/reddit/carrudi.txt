Your public key is revealed when sending from an address. Your address is a hash of the public key so you lose this additional security.
Unless you use a broken RNG, your security should still be intact, but your privacy is obviously reduced by reusing the same address

So far I found these things interesting:
* I must admit, this project was 2 years of development before release
* For example, if 0.001 is worth 1 **Euro**
*  and  are both transactions made by Satoshi to Mike Hearn (so far I thought the one to Hal Finney was the only publicly known Satoshi tx, but I might be mistaken)
Edit: If something like NZT-48 exists, then Satoshi has it.

So this has only cost him a couple hundred BTC. Not very confident for somebody who is claimed to possess significantly more than 100,000 BTC.
I still think the myth of Roger Ver owning such vast amounts of Bitcoins is only that, a myth. He might have a few thousand but that is it. 
And when even the FUD master par excellence, leader of the big block troll army, commander of shills and verified Bitcoin Judas, *Roger Ver himself*, is still keeping the majority of his 'Segwit Blockstream Coins' then even the dumbest of sheep should start to wake up

Satoshi has been using the original client for his addresses and he is still safely hodlin his mined coins in their original addresses to this day :)
You have a point though, OP. If you want to truly rule out any chance of malicious influence you have to be very determined. The source of randomness, potential hardware backdoors in your machine (intel processor), etc... are all things one would need to consider.

Among the companies at the forefront of this move is DRW Holdings LLC, a high-frequency trading firm in Chicago founded by former options-pit trader Donald Wilson in 1992. DRW is a founding investor in a new bitcoin financial-services firm called Digital Asset Holdings that launched last month. Cumberland Mining &amp; Materials LLC, a DRW subsidiary, has “begun to experiment with cryptocurrency trading,” DRW said.
And they bought their coins in the US Marshall auctions:

I'm not 100% certain but I would say, anybody could see on the blockchain that these BTC are now in localbitcoins' wallet but only localbitcoins themselves would know that these belong to the same account.
It is possible that localbitcoins combines multiple deposits of a user into one address, I do not know about their internal procedure. In this case everybody again could see that these BTC have arrived at the same destination. 
Most exchanges have individual deposit addresses, where the deposits are later combined and large deposits are sent to their cold storage addresses. But every company has their own procedures and I do not know how LBC handles deposits exactly.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:36:31
Yes it's a shame. Mempool and average transaction fees are completely through the roof, the largest they have ever been and BTC has become barely usable. Full disclosure: I switched to BCH today because honestly this is unacceptable and if you have to pretend it is not occuring through censorship of these posts then you only exacerbate the issue.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:14:20
To me and many others that is the case. Just because you do not believe that, because you fell for the manipulation here, does not make me troll nor a shill. It would help your argument if you were able to utilise logic and actual argumentation instead of calling other people shill or troll.

I know that's not what you are looking for, but there was a guy named johoe, if I remember correctly, who saved people's bitcoins when blockchain.info implemented an erroneous RNG. He has been dubbed robin hood.
Generally the fees on exchanges are really low compared to the daily price swings, almost negligible I would say.

The way I understand it is that electrum queries a server for the balances of your addresses. So this server would know that you own these addresses. Maybe someone can shed more light on this, but if I am right it would be better to use a different (electrum) wallet for before and after

@_date: 2017-11-21 17:48:50
Well you are right because with every newly identified address (and tracking companies have already mapped this ecosystem out thoroughly) more and more participants can be unmasked. I would say that at this point all exchanges and active companies are known to entities that observe the blockchain.

Pretty sick that the harassment from the manipulated hordes in this subreddit actually harms a company.

@_date: 2017-11-21 17:22:29
I think mainly through this mechanism:
Let's say you want to spend 5 BTC from your wallet, but the largest amount a single address in your wallet holds is, let's say, 1 BTC. So your wallet combines BTC from multiple of your addresses to make this 5 BTC send transaction. Now observers know that all the addresses that together formed this transaction belong to the same wallet.

What do you mean, the price going up? I think it is mainly superior in the areas of storage and transfer where gold is an absolute hassle. On the other hand Bitcoin is manmade, can be copied and reproduced which are not true for gold.
Still Bitcoin is a lot more exciting than boring old gold and the memes in this space are beyond great.
@_date: 2017-11-05 20:14:37
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:31:30
Yep but as soon as you send from one to the other, combine them at a target address or spend them together in a transaction they are obviously linked
To keep privacy intact, it is good to always spend from a single address, never reuse addresses and if possible never link any of your addresses (publicly) with your identity (including online pseudonyms)
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:32:50
If you think about it logically, worrying about what you cannot change is stupid :) The past is the past and we all have things that we regret/wish we could make different now. Use your mind to live in the present moment and work on a better future for yourself, but don't cloud your mind worrying about the past.

See this is exactly the problem. No I am not a troll nor am I trying to cause concern. I have never in my life supported BCH and always thought the people behind it were a bit rabid. But in the last days I had to admit to myself that I cannot use Bitcoin anymore. Transactions sometimes take days(!) and the fees are completely unacceptable so I switched today. But yes, go ahead call people like me concern trolls and censor posts about the problematic situation - that will surely fix everything!

It surely could, the question is if it would stand any chance of reasonable survival and usage.

If this transaction was to yourself, you can create a new transaction with a higher fee from the recipient address (child pays for parent) which will get both tx included.

You have to guess whether your order has been placed or not because even if it works an error pops up.
Worst: No communication at all!
@_date: 2017-11-20 09:42:08
But if you are intellectually honest, you will have to admit that this is just your opinion. I and many others are of the opinion that BCH is actually bitcoin. The fork was a necessary update mechanism to improve usability and limiting bitcoin at 1mb was the decision of people who plan to profit off this in their own way.
It is a natural instinct to try to silence any opinion that opposes you and this place is relying more and more on it, but is this really the right way? Should censorship resistant money be promoted by people who rely on censorship?

If this Bitcoin (which is just a balance) has ever entered an address with a higher balance then you cannot trace it back to its source, so to speak.
A Bitcoin is not a unit like a coin that gets minted and then passed around. It is basically just a balance entry in a database.
E.g. address A has 3 Bitcoins, address B has 5. Both send all their coins to address C which now has 8 Bitcoins. Now address C sends 1 Bitcoin to address D. Is the Bitcoin in address D now from A or B? No way to tell.

Somewhere out there are people, whose actual job is to shill on Reddit for Roger Ver, think about how ridiculous this is. 
Closing reddit after a long hard day of shilling: 'Honey how was your day? Did you manage to create some good fake disputes today? I know these real people can be tiring but you have to keep at it, we really need this shill money at this point in our lives!'
Meeting friends: 'Yo buddy, so how is the shilling business progressing? Are you like top of the pack already, or are you still a sub-shill?'
Talking to his parents: 'Son, we always knew you would find your place in life. We are so happy that you are now spending your days shilling for Roger Ver on reddit, all of our friends are jealous when we tell them about your work.'
Recommendation letter after work is done: 'Shilly was an excellent shill in all areas of shilling. He created drama, fought relentlessly against nullc and theymos and created many a fake dispute. Shilly will, without a doubt, be the perfect fit for all your shilling needs.'

I'm sorry that happened to you. I can understand that this must hurt a lot, you will recover from it, learn and be even stronger in the future! I fell into a hole myself after MTGox. Take deep breaths, go for a run and realise that in the end it was 'just' money.
In nature unfortunately life exists by living off other life in one way or another. Eat and get eaten. Sometimes the human existence and our civilization shield us from these basic priciples but here and there we come in contact with it again. You have your life, the only thing you lost was money. You have managed to amass 9 BTC once, you will take the harsh lessons you have learned, find strength again and come out even more successful than before!
I say that so directly, because I doubt there will be chance to catch the thief. Nonetheless I hope you'll find some clues (attack vector/destination of funds).

Will the MTGox users who erroneously received higher BTC balances because of the thief's actions and who subsequently simply took these free Bitcoins, without reporting the error, be prosecuted?

Yep another chapter in the fantastic Bitcoins saga :) 
Either way, luckily the owners shut the service down gracefully and users weren't affected by an exit scam

What the actual f...? This reads as if someone either hacked this account or paid or otherwise pressured the owner to this effect. The views stated are completely orthogonal to those held by someone who built and operated the most successful Bitcoin mixer.
@_date: 2017-07-26 21:30:32
Ok so through this guy's wallets ran the funds stolen from MTGox, Bitcoinica, Bitfloor and several others.
Is this man one of the most prolific hackers on this planet? Or is he the best connected money launderer on the internet which somehow all major BTC thieves find and use? How can he be connected to this many thefts? This is really mind-blowing.
I still think it is extremely unlikely that a money launderer/master hacker of this magnitude would openly use his full name in connection with stolen coins on Bitcointalk which is what the accused account 'WME' did. This man might just be a fall guy.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:05:37










We're going to split this into a couple of different posts, as our full findings cover a wider range of topics, and for this post we'll just very quickly summarize the main BTC theft and its connection to Vinnik:
* In September 2011, the MtGox hot wallet private keys were stolen, in a case of a simple copied wallet.dat file. This gave the hacker access to a sizable number of bitcoins immediately, but also were able to spend the incoming trickle of bitcoins deposited to any of the addresses contained.
* Over time, the hacker regularly emptied out whatever coins they could spend using the compromised keys, and sent them to wallet(s) controlled by Vinnik. This went on for long periods, but also had breaks — a prominent second phase of thefts happened later in 2012 and 2013.
* By mid 2013 when the funds spendable from the compromised keys had slowed to a near halt, the thief had taken out about 630,000 BTC from MtGox.
* In addition, the shared keypool of the wallet.dat file lead to address reuse, which confused MtGox's systems into mistakenly interpreting some of the thief's spending as deposits, crediting multiple user accounts with large sums of BTC and causing MtGox's numbers to go further out of balance by about 40,000 BTC. None of these users seem to have reported their "sudden luck".
* After the coins entered Vinnik's wallets, most were moved to BTC-e and presumably sold off or laundered (BTC-e money codes were a popular choice). In total some 300,000 BTC ended up on BTC-e, while other coins were deposited to other exchanges, including MtGox itself.
* Some of the funds moved to BTC-e seem to have moved straight to internal storage rather than customer deposit addresses, hinting at a relationship between Vinnik and BTC-e.
* The stolen MtGox coins were not the only stolen coins handled by Vinnik; coins stolen from Bitcoinica, Bitfloor and several other thefts from back in 2011 and 2012 were all laundered through the same wallets.
* Moving coins back onto MtGox was what let us identify Vinnik, as the MtGox accounts he used could be linked to his online identity "WME". As WME, Vinnik had previously made a public outcry that coins had been confiscated from him (the coins in question coming from Bitcoinica).
* There were other thefts and incidents explaining other missing funds from MtGox. More on that in later posts.


Coin flow
Having identified the actual transactions for the bulk of the stolen MtGox bitcoins, we traced them and clustered all addresses involved, quickly finding that other stolen coins were making their way into the same wallets. Below is a summarized illustration highlighting the theft coin flow of September 2011 onwards:


As some coins were deposited back to MtGox, we could identify which accounts were used to receive them; two in particular were of interest, and were possible to link to the online identity "WME". (Clusters who directly used these MtGox accounts are highlighted in red.) WME has been active since a long time back, often advertising "cheap coins" on the BitcoinTalk forums and wanting to trade exchange money codes. BTC-e publicly vouched for him, saying that "[we] know WME very well".






We're currently preparing more material for disclosure, so for more information on the MtGox theft, and all the other aspects of the MtGox case that we didn't have time to cover in this post, stay tuned and check back again soon.

Just blockchain.info and reddit. Here is what I know:
This address is owned by the same entity as all these other rich addresses and this entity is Coinbase: 
A while ago someone mistakenly sent I think 850 BTC to Gox from his Coinbase account and it either came from one of these addresses or then ended there again when the trustee returned to coins to his Coinbase address. You can find that on reddit if you want to start digging

the miners then will receive their income from transaction fees
The transaction fees are currently around 1-2 BTC per block, looking at the last few blocks. Over time they will increase as the usage increases

So do you think they filed this change to make the caught man look like the sole owner, basically make him the fall guy?

Very great report! Looking forward to additional details.


Wow so some greedy fools received free BTC on MtGox and simply took them without reporting it.

At what point will the USA stop to be the world police? I think we will start to see more and more cryptourrency services exclude american customers, because their government is simply one of the biggest threats in this space.
It is like the kid whose father is choleric and violent. Parents of other kids don't want them to invite this kid to their parties because the kids father might come and let his rage loose.

No that is one of Coinbase's addresses
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:45:10
Agreed with that part. But this still seems very very fishy. Especially his plea for other mixers to also stop their service. 
A person who has for years helped obfuscate large amounts of likely illegal funds suddenly leaves his very profitable business and becomes a preacher for clean and transparent Bitcoin...? Something else is going on here
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:20:19
Is the state allowed to press charges against someone if they cannot prove anything?
If OP did mine them, then he mined them, whether he can proof it or not. If he did not get them illegally, the state cannot prove he got them illegally. Could they still charge him/block his funds?
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:49:07
I suspect he wants to claim to his government that his Bitcoins have been mined a long time ago, to avoid paying taxes or revealing their true source. So he is looking for coins mined by a private person (can't be easily proven it was not him) and from a time when it was still possible to mine yourself with CPU/GPU so he doesnt need to prove the existence of a small miner farm and can simply say: 'I just left my computer on with this Bitcoin software running then I totally forgot about it and now I have hundreds of thousands of $, wow!'
@_date: 2017-06-08 07:00:20
This doesn't make much sense, because the receiving party knows that you could still spend those BTC yourself at anytime as you have the private key.
Just send them as a transaction to their address? This is what Bitcoin is for, after all.

OP, here are some of your last comments:
[You have no knowledge of economics but you are pretending you do](
[Ah you understand economics. Ok. So what books on the subject have you read](
[I've never came across a big block proponent that even CLAIMS to understand economics. Let alone one that has read a single book on the subject.](
[I repeat, no one that wants the blocksize increased even CLAIMS to understand economics. Ur an idiot.](
[ask andreas if he knows anything about economics](
[I've never met a big blocker that knows anything about economics.](
[I've never found a big blocker that claims to understand economics.](
[Op knows nothing about economic](
[But you don't know anything about economics and you are just spreading fud though.](
[Op is a moron that knows nothing about economics.](
And these are just from the last two weeks! Ok we get it OP... nobody knows anything about economics

I think the servers know the addresses in your wallet as it queries them for the balances. So they could connect IP and Bitcoin addresses.
I like electrum, but we can be certain that tracking organisations and government agencies also run electrum servers.

Perhaps limiting Bitcoin and thus pumping their hypothetical Eth holdings is more profitable to them.
For some people, blocking Bitcoin's growth and supporting Ethereum's can offer far higher gains. Sad stuff

Dude they have only received hundreds of millions of USD and now have a valuation of $1B, do you you really think they can afford stable servers or customer support with this money? Brian Armstrong's salary is definitely more important!
