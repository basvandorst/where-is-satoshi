Look up the word 'hyberbole', I think that wiktionary page could articulate it far better than a dumbo like me could.

if ever is a relative thing on the internet.

I see what you're saying, and it's equally applicable to just finance and fiat in general, which is a lot more analogous, but my point has nothing to do with how likely an 'ignorant' public is to adopt bitcoin.
In fact, what I was stating was that it is unequivocally GOOD (for us) that the public doesn't really know about it... yet.

I find that very unlikely.  I would accept perhaps most had heard of bitcoin, but no way blockchain.  Not that this is a bad thing for anyone here, necessarily.

Uh, you are aware cars were once powered by STEAM?  While I'm aware that that is also a combustion engine, I think that idea is more what the guy at the party was getting at.
Blockchain technology is a bigger deal than bitcoin.  Of course you are biased by your...bitcoin...
But that is the way it is.

I see both BCH and BTC dropping.  I think that this move by Coinbase hurt overall faith in the crypto community.  Not good.  May take time to recover, if ever.

Uh, have you ever been to a red-state?  "pre-Gawker".. lol.

All humans are accident prone.  That is what it is to be human.  You must realize this.  Sure, it might be out of sight out of mind, but that's the way it is.

There's an image.  Of course it's not 'proveable' anything more than anything else in crypto, but it's what I believe.  
I don't delusion-ally hate BCH,  lol, but of course, I mean, I do HATE it as much as anyone can HATE a non-tangible asset at least.  I don't roll around in bed thinking about it, but it's pretty clear in my mind what happened.
It's good to see an article like this.  I'm just a casual holder of a small amount of bitcoin.  I largely have no stake personally or otherwise, but am excited about crypto in general.  
Anyway, best wishes to you and yours.  When it comes to people - spew love.  Not hate.

Go back and look.  Go look.  This current overall downtrend we've been experiencing began when Coibase listed BCH.  That is all.  I remember thinking about selling then. 
Great fucking article.

You're having an awfully violent reaction to what I'm saying.  But did you look at the charts?
