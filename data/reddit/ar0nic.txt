an average child will attend no less than 3 schools before college, 4 if there is an intermediate school.  If you move around often for whatever reason the number could jump 1 per 4 years as most people will wait till the end of the year to move. also YES.


it would be MUCH MORE appropriate to require a COLLEGE student to have one of these devices than any child in grade, school, the word CHILD here is very important to context. 


this could've been made overall in your argument with simple context clues.


if you have tried to type properly and quickly with a tablet you would not have had to include that last line, It maybe easy to use t-9 on a phone with or without swype for your text messages or reddit replies is one thing, expecting a young student to wield a tablet for any personal note taking is pretty crazy.
There are two reasons why, if the tablet is to be used by the school to do school work ON, meaning they're loading assignments on the device for the child to do, then the school needs to supply the device, and in most cases they DO. If the device is to supplement any other assignments are activities, they school needs to provide them.
Note taking, I really think this is a bit of a no brainer but you can't take proper notes, at least imo on a TABLET. I never stated anything about the whole tablet with a keyboard verses table with a desktop argument you included BUUUUT,
My kid takes care of things really well, and she still ends up with broken things, I could never ensure the well being of both a tablet and a keyboard for her to carry day in and day out. 
If the school wants their students to have these devices then the school needs to provide them like they currently do as rentals to students which cannot afford them.
I think you're being trivial and I think you knew exactly what I meant with my reply.  
I'm not some young kid who grew up with computers in school my entire life, I grew up when computers were no where and then they were everywhere in terms of school and I never ever needed to carry a tablet/laptop to learn. It is a crutch to make teachers jobs easier. Let the computer learn em instead of having to engage them. We learned on tandys..and there is not much you can learn on a tandy. besides coraldraw and baby bounce
and kings quest
and leisure suite larry.

you would be better served getting a dell xps over a alienware any day.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:47:00
any laptop dell makes thats not a BUSINESS line ie: optiplex or xps.
they're desktops are ok but they are using the cheapest of cheap, i mean VIA CHIPSETS are not great, but they're not terrible yet dell somehow manages to buy all the shittiest chipsets, sans intel wifi.
tablets..lol where to start, they are just shit, across the board.
dell used to make some good tv's and monitors, then they started doing what every other manufacture does, use samsungs shitty panels, not the good ones, the cheap shitty ones that never last. then they said hmm we will just kill off the line of displays we make and give the people vizio and low quality samsungs at a higher price.
i still only sell dell's to old people, solely cause of thier customer support and warranty and discount programs, other than that i wouldnt wipe my ass with their products.
everything i have said here is a google search away so for the naysayers don't make me do your homework.

.. Ugh I was being a generic as possible...  But what you describe is exactly what "load the assignments"  mean.  I have a middle school aged kid.  I'm well aware. 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:32:32
you just bought a piece of junk.. lets hope you get a year of use out of it.
I'm a certified dell repair technician. I would be..careful to say the least.
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:10:56
check the front page of the subreddit. sorry but that saying, if it hurts its probably a little true.
its a lot true.
@_date: 2014-07-20 19:48:06
pfft. id tell the school to lick my sweaty bean bag as i send her to school with pen and paper.
it is proven that retention of learning is much higher while note taking by hand.
most schools  here will provide them with things like that as opposed to shifting the cost to the parents, sans finishing/prep/private schools.

worthy right here
@_date: 2014-07-21 06:58:37
Maybe they have turned the corner with them.. I just constantly see tickets on them 
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:38:09
as a certified dell repair specilialist i can agree and disagree with you, overpriced yes, but there are a few lines that are rock solid, and the xps is one of them.
as for other non computer stuff, its all overpriced junk, vizio LOL garbage, their tablets, they're shit.
the entire xps line is rock solid, worth just about every penny, and you cannot beat dells customer service when it comes to rma's.
also they offer a rock solid discount program.
If you knew anything about dell you would of known to exclude the xps line altogether from your blanket "overpriced" statement.
You cannot find a better gaming laptop than an xps for the price.

sorry dude, this place reeks of bullshit, its sad when dogecoin has legit users who are actually interested in the technology. face it you've become the digg of bitcoin communities.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:33:22
which is what you get for adopting this type of "Currency" on a large scale use.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:30:49
lol vizio is shit, dell makes one decent line of laptops the xps which are horribly overpriced.
If you want to waste your bitcoin on overpriced items or overpriced garbage as a show of thanks, go right ahead i guess.
also don't even get me started on their line of tablets.
I get that its good they accept bitcoin, but this is really a silly circlejerk.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:19:26
this place is a circlejerk graveyard.. maybe thats why?
@_date: 2014-02-10 20:23:23
lol, no, its NOT a news site, NOTHING on reddit is a news site. if anything it is a bunch of OP ED's and Letters to the Editor.
that line of thinking is one of the  problem with reddit as a whole.
and are the biggest offenders. when you post an article and then a mod comes along and says oh this is misleading or editorialized tagged obviously without reading, it negates the whole premise.
No matter what this community says or does, the damage is done, this place is a circle jerk within the bitcoin community and nothing will change it from here on out, without the mods stepping up their game (they won't) or a whole new set of mods and rules get put into place. Sure there are trolls, but the heart of the problem lies with the user base's better than thou attitude as a whole.
@_date: 2014-07-22 17:24:19
you apparently have no kids or would know why you should not entrust a young child with a tablet and a keyboard to lug around, also my original post says that there is no difference than a tablet with keyboard or laptop. they are the same, it is just silly to think that a child should have to handle two things like that. silly.
@_date: 2014-07-20 16:35:21
Funny I have kids and none of this is "required".
My girlfriend is in college, she isn't required to have one.
not everyone requires them. also doing school work of any kind on a tablet is stupid, slow, and just not a great idea. Try typing a 300 page report on a tablet.
@_date: 2014-05-05 14:42:47
i agree with op, this place has slowly evolved into a shitpool of circle-jerkery and little girl fights. its a place ive removed from my front page and only browse on @_date: 2014-07-20 17:23:46
Cause that's practical!  Pfft.

except for nazis...

@_date: 2013-12-20 17:31:18
You're delusional.. You're wishing death on someone.. You should stop right there.  Forget the entire conversation.. Even tho the term "*whatever* nazi"  is a long running joke for at least 30 years... And ask yourself.. Am I a good person?  The answer is no.  Never wish bad things for people..  Especially over petty dumb shit on the net. 
Nazi jokes are funny.  If you don't like what you see on this site Get off. But telling people to kill themselves makes you the bad person.  You are a bad person. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:48:49
Or anywhere... You're sort of a turd.

Jew death toll touches around 7 million.  If you want to count slovs and gypsies it pushes that # to around 9 million.  
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:40:09
You have the largest stick up your butt about this.. You're coming off like anyone joking about nazis are a sympathizer or Holocaust denier.  It's time to slow your role way down.  I've had family who fought in that war for those people who were persecuted.  I understand the clear reality.. But guess what the soup nazi sketch is just one example of that humor and the world loved it.   If you can't take it.. Then maybe that funny isn't for  you.. It is time you turn your sensitive self away from it. 
Look up patrice oniel "what is funny"  for further advice
