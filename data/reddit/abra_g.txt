Should probably let the community know how you plan to pay $15 for $12 worth of BTC. As of now, you're just expecting people to send you $12 of BTC

Hmm, interesting take. Here's something I think you might have implied but not said explicitly — inflation is only good when there's significant value add to "back" the given period and rate of inflation. We may have moved off the gold standard but there's a reason that fiat works. Once there's a large disconnect between the perceived strength of a given economy (due to a myriad of factors such as GDP or efficiency coefficients of capital/labor/technology) &amp; their inflationary policies (for whatever reason), then the currency will quickly be worthless. We can see this happening in Venezuela and it has historically happened multiple times in developing nations.

Helped a friend buy his first bitcoin, news reported price going up by 25% (this was during the bull run), next time he saw me he asked me why he still only had 1 BTC and if it was because he was keeping it in a cold wallet.

Well I think he's referencing an IOU in finance generally tends to be read as "debt". Debt is inherently backed by the value of whatever collateral was offered up. 
On the flip side, there are instances of debt that have very tenuous ideas of backing or overvaluation of collateral, etc etc, which push debt and debt-like instruments towards something of little real backing. 
Just my two cents.

Exactly, with any type of fractional reserve system or currency vehicle that isn't "stable", it (for lack of better words) cheapens the idea behind debt. 
In its purest sense, debt calls into the question the current earning potential of an individual/entity and looks at the risk associated before issuing the debt. Debt existed even before the modern currency systems, look at instances of debt in barter societies. In these, usually backed by skills/time/effort of individuals.
