While in bitcoin or ethereum, even users can change its consensus algoritham. And there are many things, like change in the code which is not possible in couns like bitcoin and ethereum.

Views are appreciated mate. But, we try to write the things which interact with visitors in a casual way. Sorry, I couldn't write it in a so-called-article format.

Yeah, we kept this in that way. I think author just overdid it, will keep that in mind next time. Keep blockchain-ing with itsblockchain.

Haha! Indeed they are.

Main thing is their consensus algorithm can modify itself according to need while in other blockchain consensus algorithm is fixed. 
You did not get the thing I guess.

1. Bitcoin Core's trump card means Bitcoin core is Bitcoin community, we talked about that community's trump card.
2. segwit is politically biased, to know more about politics behind it mail at omprakashmlv9
3. For general info about what USAF and Segwit2x is, we have given link to previous article describing these term nicely.
4. If you are analyzing each and every word like, fork means chainsplit or USAF?, I think both means chainsplit, terms like hard and soft fork are just the way how you're going to split the chain. 
Also, somewhere you might be possibly right. We will try to improve further. Afterall, criticism is the best motivation.

as far as I know, nope!

It is becoming confusing for you. The thing is, whatever written there is sufficient for blockchain people to understand. Read about consensus algorithm. Modification in consensus algorithm is what makes is self amendment. Obviously in a decentralised network, one can not reflect changes himself without permission of users. But at what extend, users can permit changes is the key factor.

It is never too late to start fresh. :P

Yeah. There rumors out there that segwit is politically biased. They want to benefit sidechain as well, and segwit is the best way to do that. Point to be noted here- Sidechain's creator is same man who is behind the hashcash, proof of work algorithm used in bitcoin.

Market will get in shape again after 1st of august. Market cap can go down to 65-70billion dollar, then it will rise again.
