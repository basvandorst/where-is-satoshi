Well, yeah, shouts to this community for that. Back in 2012, after I got goxxed, the information in this sub gave me enough insight to replenish my faith in Bitcoin and buy back in. Came back about half a year ago and am so happy to see it thriving and growing.

Awesome thanks! and right, saw that they just moved to cancel-only mode. Staying away from that whole problem.

Dumb question, dumb dumb question. Beginner question. But I've never dealt with the fork! I just discovered BCH in my Coinbase account. I've already moved my real Bitcoins (BTC) out of that account and into other exchanges and back and forth and so-on. 
So my question: Can I just sell most/all of my BCH and make money on that too? Since it is a hard fork, this wont affect my real BTC, right? Because I want to get rid of my Bitcoin Cash legit ASAP.

This company has been around for a while and continues to rock the music engineering world. A huge step for bitcoin and for the kickass plugins!

This guy seems like he might be on here just to market the company...or he could be a very good fan of the site lol. Anybody ever end up finding out whether this site is trustworthy?

Go to the pool parties while you are there. Don't just do Ultra. It gives you a chance to relax throughout the week and see good DJs...plus theyre usually at good hotels and really inexpensive. I went last year and had a blast. Now I'm a student at UM, so I'm pumped that it's basically in my backyard this time around!

Can confirm. Looks like they're based in the US too, so it could be easier to seek legal action if something happens. Plus, you buy bitcoins at the current price--meaning even if you transfer it from a bank account, the amount you pay is locked-in once you press buy.
