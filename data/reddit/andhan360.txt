... or in other words: all witness data, including both scriptSig (pre-segwit transactions) and segwit witness data (if applicable), is measured as 1 weight-unit (WU), while all other data in the block is measured as 4 WU. The weight of a block may not exceed double the size limit in bytes.
The maximum size of a transaction stripped of witness data is limited to 1 MB.
Without listening to this podcasts (ha, would be better the caster would be a lil more technical to ask this too), it’s not hard to guess that Luke was talking in context of blockchain growth rate. 
And with limit of 4 million WU this will result in full blocks of 2-3MB blocks. By expected 52596 blocks per year this is a growth rate of more than 100GB per year. 
IBD already a pain in the ass and with this high growth rate, it gets worse many years before tech improvement catches up and it gets faster than today.

I agree, but I said it will result, expecting 100% segwit adoption when usage is that high that everything is exceeded and every block is full. As we had ~2.2mb blocks already. 
I perhaps misformulate, I jus wanted to bring it in context wit Luke’s talk and that we have &gt;1MB blocks as you say. Even with your detailled explanation, blockchain growth rate is higher than tech improv rate (17-18%)
