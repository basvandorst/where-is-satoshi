I'm here. I'll provide some updates. Hasn't been much by way of news but lots of optimism so far. 
Edit: insiders expect him to be positive and cooperative in his keynote. First Data CEO on now. 
First Data talking up tech and partnerships. References gyft directly. 
Talking about opening up walls and enabling partnerships. 
Teasing a new platform.
Probably bitcoin... But we'll have to go see their booth tomorrow. New partners being teased hard. 
First Data is the largest merchant acquirer and issuer processor in the world. 
Bens up now
Statutory scheme  written before the Internet. 
Serious and documented concerns about consumer safety. Illegal activity has grown within the virtual currency world. 
Power behind the tech is amazing. Change and evolve. Platforms built and the future isn't realized. 
VC can provide much cheaper fees, frictionless transactions, and less id theft risk. (you guys rock thank you...) 
DFS is excited about virtual currencies. He's avoiding saying bitcoin... 
Hearings were held earlier this year to get a view of the industry. 
Hearings taught DFS and sparked debate which is ongoing. 
Defending his regulatory framework.. As a starting point and he got the conversation he hoped for. 
Initial proposal was never take it or leave it. 
Apologies for the formatting here I know it isn't ideal... 
New draft around beginning of December... Final regulatory framework in January 
Mirroring financial regulation intended for banks. No word on who will be targeted by the regs. 
All this is for you, the consumer! 
No way he takes questions after this. 
Cyber security is paramount importance. 
Changes to regs:
Who is required... Not software development. Only Financial intermediaries. Repeated it to be clear. 
Individuals will not be required. 
Process will be streamlined across licenses. 
Banks will be forced to comply as well if they provide vc services. 
Miners and pools will not be regulated. 
NEW CHANGE
Compliance costs too heavy for startups. Special bit license for smaller guys. 
Preventing money laundering is their focus. As well as consumer protection. 
Suggesting an outside vendor to pay for compliance service for startups... 
Please don't leave new york... We need regulations and you
Good regs will help bitcoin. And spur adoption. See I'm helping! 
Oh wow he's doing a q&amp;a
Elliot from Kraken -- asks why the state level is an appropriate regulatory body
A Money transmission is regulated on the state level traditionally -- He doesn't know if a single fed reg would be better.  Be careful what you wish for.  References insurance and dodd frank faliure regulating on the federal level.  monoliths have pros and cons.  you dont get a regulator that sees what is going on in thier individual state.  financial tech is an international issue -- mt gox -- so that presents real challenges (still not sure why he thinks he's an appropriate reg)
Q -- Martin Mushkin asked about the broadly defined "transaction" and cites a coming constitutional concern
A -- ill look into it...side steps and talks about payday loans and protecting NYers
Q Cirlce thanks him for working with the industry -- asks about AML provisions
A -- changes to make it consistent with federal regs -- non committal -- KYC may be impossible for a firm -- we're not going to ask firms to do something that they cannot do but what cannot be done?  we;re looking at that...onboarding process can be bulked up? lawsky thinks maybe!
Q -- What have you learned and what do you think about multi signatures
A -- my view is constantly evolving.  i read the economist on the way out.  it scared me.  the more we study the more we realize that the tech is powerful.  huge ny community use western union or money gram and pay 8-9% to do that...these people cant afford those rate and virtual currencies hold promise to bring that way down. thats powerful.  theres real there there!  ben likes remittance.
Q -- how much tax money spent on bitlicense and how many outcries asked for protection from DFS
A -- zero money spent -- just the general budget -- our job is to spend our time working on important things -- we were obligated -- our Dept is funded by assessment on the banks.  tax payers get a good deal.  there was no outcry.  Money laundering.  Terrorism.  I think that NYers and Americans want regulators that care about money laundering. jeez...
3 more questions
Q Van Cleef -- clarify comments wrt banks.  do they have to apply or approval under ordinary course of supervision of banks -- NY banks under state carter or other banks?
A  Intent is that banks will have to meet all the same reqs of a bitcoin biz.  they need to get a license but may cross apply with other license -- non ny banks have to apply if it affects NY consumers
Q  P2P exchanges like local btc and mycellium
A  if they're exchanges they should be regulated as such.  
Last Q -- CoinDesk -- non financial blockchain transactions like smart contracts -- bitlicense for those?
A -- if non financial transaction then it wouldnt fall within intended targets -- certain businesses require small money being exchanged and then that would apply.  even if its tiny.  how do we regulate it? no know what do!  
Thanks yall thats it.  You'll see a more comprehensive writeup elsewhere im sure.  Thanks for the tips!!!!

Assuming that the New York State Division of Financial Services is the regulatory authority that will decide any meaningful fate of Bitcoin or companies that work in this space  is fundamentally flawed. Lawsky is positioning himself for the next step in his career. And he's doing a great job of it. He won't play much of a role when it comes to the big decisions... Unless they take a few years to occur. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 02:57:05
Well the second includes everyone... Including me :) 
But the issue presented is a real concern. In my view it's an opportunity to invest. The sell side has created strong downward pressure where the buy side forces are not there yet. So we have the potential of an etf or hedge fund activity or merchants passing on real savings... Time will tell.

you're confused about some very basic definitions and principles here.  
with respect to economics: price, inflation, deflation, and currency are good places to start.
with respect to bitcoin: supply is fixed, not "ever increasing" the fact that it is being released at a set rate over time is a different concept entirely.
edit: if you're using the word inflation to mean increase in volume (inflate like a balloon fills with air) then you're technically correct  -- but that would be a pretty silly way to discuss a currency since most people will assume you're using it in terms of its economic meaning...

yeah, i mean...lost out to Draper's 650/btc bid?  I think everyone won that day except for Draper...Buying in bulk is essentially the same as selling in bulk.  On the other side of the Draper coin is the bearwhale -- an individual that basically forfeited 20-25% by just dumping it all at once.  One thing that we can say with the utmost certainty, through the benefit of hindsight, is that Draper overpaid and the bearwhale fucked up.
I understand your point but calling this auction OTC is a bit of a misnomer.

The whole point would be for the merchants to start passing the savings onto the consumer, making it cheaper to transact in BTC for both sides. 
@_date: 2014-11-04 06:33:51
No. It wasn't like that at all. They totally screwed this up. Bitcoin talks were PACKED all day. Not even standing room, they refused entry to some of the talks due to fire hazard. 
This was not an organized walk out or any of that bullshit. They fucked up. Plain and simple. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:52:18
Great commentary, but the CFTC talk is a bit early no?  
We're seeing a lot of trading and investment analysis without an underlying utilitarian value of bitcoin developing.  Without further success (or even any success) as a means of payment the investment talk seems like putting the cart before the horse.  Particularly when we're talking about swaps and options.
TL;DR - I can't buy a cup of coffee with bitcoin in Manhattan.

@_date: 2014-10-15 16:47:03
What are you talking about? What merchant that doesn't already accept btc is going to set it up to liquidate immediately on the spot when a customer asks to pay using bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2014-07-29 14:42:45
inflation and deflation isn't strictly tied to supply -- it has to do with the purchasing power of a particular currency against goods and services.  
moreover, supply in this case is fixed in its total amount and you're pinning inflation/deflationary effects to availability of a total fixed supply.
if demand continues to increase then the fixed supply (both in terms of total supply and annually mined) creates a deflationary effect.
@_date: 2014-07-03 03:42:17
apologies if this isn't the most intelligent question ever but what does this mean? if i have a coinbase wallet i can't export my BTC to another wallet that i own/control?  doesn't this defeat a central advantage of BTC?

That's not the point. Dumping the way he or she did was silly. Bearwhale couldn't have known future market direction. 
Good move in retrospect. Wouldn't we all like to do this backwards...

How about a quick meet up in between the first and second session for Bitcoin World in Juniper 4.  Under the front screen to the left when facing the stage.

the exact replica, the cheap clone, whatever you want to call it, simply discourages future inventors from doing what Trezor did.

Can you link the ETFs you're referring to?  I'd love to take a look at them if I've missed it.
OTCs are traded on real exchanges through OTCBB (Bulletin Board) or pink sheets.  It would accomplish the exact same thing the Winkles are trying to get just in a different way.  
From what I understand they're going to be held up for quite some time.  I believe the last commodity to be approved for an ETF was for copper -- which has been around a bit longer than bitcoin.  Nevermind the security and insurance issues that we've heard about holding this one up.

You're absolutely right but its an interesting intersection between IP and open-source.  
In this instance, Trezor provided as much information as possible through the open source model to convince the Bitcoin community their coins would be safe in their product.  I get the feeling that this is a different situation where a company used that information to build an exact replica at a cheaper price point.  
A company that releases their product open-source at least hopes that someone who builds upon their product actually offers something new instead of taking advantage of the good faith effort provided in the original.  There isn't much legal recourse for Trezor in this instance, but its still a bit of a dick move.

i'm sure that helped.  thanks for playing, op.
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:54:13
dropping the cost of tickets and exhibits would have helped a lot.  its early days for bitcoin there is no need to keep such high barriers to entry.  especially considering there would have been boatloads of students and young professionals that would have attended.  
how many speakers were no shows on day one?  my count was 7 but i stuck to a single track so it could have been higher.
how about the fact that almost every single talk had been given regurgitated crap?

He can push it out there... My bet is he will tomorrow for some pr during an otherwise very quiet conference 
@_date: 2015-04-29 13:49:42
Yesterday was actually well attended if we use the capacity of the rooms as a metric: they were full... 
Today Track 2 is empty. Maybe people overslept.

Big money is interested but still watching. Particularly commodity and Derivative players. Watchers could flip the switch and become players very soon because of the bit.

the benefit will come from merchants that offer to pass on the merchant discount savings to the consumer. In doing so they're able to shift incoming revenue from credit card transactions to BTC and thus save the 2.5-3.5% per transaction.

All in all a great event. Gavin is a really smart guy and the Bitcoin Foundation has a solid... Foundation. 
Circle did a great job hosting the event and the conversation between their co-founders was thoughtful and though provoking. 
The audience chimed in with good questions stirring the block size debate. Concerns are warranted on all sides. I tend to think we're in good hands with Gavin but he welcomed the conversation - instilling confidence in the process. 
Looking forward to seeing the subsequent interviews!

Sure it can... What happens if a government just starts throwing people in jail? That alone would put a huge stop on this for the vast majority of the population.
