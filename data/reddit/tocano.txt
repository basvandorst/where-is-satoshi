I love the sheer gall of a govt that has been exposed as having ignored 4th amendment limitations on surveillance and privacy infringements, to turn around and use the 4th amendment as *justification* for invasion of privacy. Astounding.

Not saying you're wrong (especially since I don't know how that site works), but loans don't necessarily mean fractional reserve.

So you have no idea. 
With most open ended predictions like this, there needs to a time limit involved. So if it's still growing in 2 years, will that change your mind? 4 years? 10 years? Or does it have to supplant all existing currencies and run for a century before you'd admit you might have been wrong?
It's easy to just sit back and say "It'll fail." with no timeline involved. Step up and put some risk in it. 
At the very least describe HOW you think it will fail.

Lessons learned: record all interviews in their entirety, regardless of with whom. Firstly, simply knowing they're being recorded may discourage the most egregious of misleading journalism. But beyond that, not only will it allow you to challenge selective quoting, but it can be a good resource for the community. I know that I have enjoyed listening to a few instances where a libertarian published a full recorded interview with a newspaper or magazine. It's interesting to hear the questions asked and to hear the response given in real time. Not only informative, but also helps sharpen my own points.

So because of the public ledger, does bitcoin eliminate (or at least dramatically reduce) the ability for fractional reserve banking?
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:33:06
Keep in mind that if a country were to buy that much bitcoin and then try to regulate it and control it and they did so in a way that frustrated the market, people would likely simply switch to one of the other crypto-currencies. That's one of the great things about the crypto-currency universe: it creates the best situation for competition in currency society has had for centuries. Oppressive govts figure out a way infiltrate and manipulate most prevalent currency, people can simply begin to move to a different currency. Once the infrastructure is in place for handling crypt-currencies and people begin to get used to the idea, switching from one to another shouldn't be terribly difficult.

I guess that's closer to what I was really asking: does the public ledger make it possible for the general public to confirm reserve rates on financial entities? It seems that the answer is "as long as the entity chooses to participate".
So does that participation simply take the form of the entity publicizing their wallet address(es) for confirmation of quantity?

Just something to keep in mind that I wasn't clear on and so confused me on this same question: Only 1 single block is mined across the entire bitcoin network approx every 10 min. Once whomever is mining finds the hash that matches for their collection of transactions, that block is submitted and the entire network of miners has to start over on the next block. 
As such, you sitting at home on your single computer trying hashes essentially have to be unbelievably, unrealistically lucky in order to "happen" upon the right hash very early in order to actually have your block beat the entire hashing farms out there.

So the way my brain works, I'm curious about how this scene in the original movie would have panned differently if done today.
For example, when they originally shot this, I picture the director walking up to the kid and their parents and saying, "Ok, in this scene he's supposed to to pick her up, swing her and throw her into the water. You ok with that?"  Kid and parents look at each other, nod and then they record.
Today, there's a safety coordinator, a team of 3 medics, 5 lawyers, and a backup stunt child. The director walks up to the kid and parents and says, "Ok, in this scene he's supposed to pick her up, swing her and throw her into the water. Please sign this 50 page legal contract which releases us from all liability for any harm, physical, emotional, or psychological, due to the scene."

Who said I was criticising protecting children? I'm just contrasting how much less litigious people probably were. So it made me curious how little planning and prep may have gone into that scene originally vs how it would happen today.
So calm the hell down. I shared a quirky thought that popped into my head, not attacking your entire socio-political ideology.

Etymologically speaking, people/society tend to create the words to handle these types of things organically - and trying to control what it becomes is usually unsuccessful - with rare exceptions.
For example, it may be that the community tries to creatively call a mBTC a cKatoshi, the 'c' for 100, the K for the thousand Satoshi's (100 x 1000 = 100,000 satoshi's in a mBTC) and they claim it can be conversationally shortened to just "cKat" ("see-cat"). Brilliant, right!?
Except most people may not care about all that and may focus solely on the metric aspect, so may just call it a "mĭb" as short for "miliBitcoin".
So when someone asks how much for a pint, they get, "3 mib". All the worries about getting an accurate, creative, and easy to remember/say name aren't likely to matter. People will use what they personally feel comes easy to them.

Keep in mind this is the country whose govt completely demonetized the entire nation and forced all transactions to be traceable and money trackable because too much money was going untaxed.
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:22:30
Not to rain on the parade, I would love for this to become the future as much as anyone, but let's remember: All that would have to happen is the govt to outright ban bitcoin or cryptocurrencies in general as a legitimate form of payment and retailer adoption completely evaporates. 
While it's true that govts cannot absolutely ban cryptocurrencies - they can massively curtail growth by prohibiting (legitimate) retailers from using bitcoin. In fact, if they got desperate, I could see them passing regulation that requires ISPs prohibit network traffic that appears to be "use of '*criminal*' internet currencies" or somesuch verbiage which they'll figure out how to make sure bitcoin qualifies as.
So let's be optimistic, but cautiously so as it is not unreasonable to see a threatened govt try to pull the rug out from under it.

Just chiming in that traditionally, when you had an author or celebrity that either had Q&amp;A sessions or interviews, they were topical and somewhat focused. They were about the book just written, or about the movie just opening, or about the anniversary of some event being covered. Questions that were irrelevant or unrelated to that topic were avoided or dismissed.
AMAs became an alternative approach in which there wasn't a specific topic or focus and instead open to any topic that may come up, from current projects, to future plans, to past work, to personal stories/lives/preferences. Obviously, as others pointed out, this doesn't obligate them to answer *any* question ("What's your bank account and password?") but the AMA format is just a more open forum in which a much wider variety of questions are considered acceptable and may receive an answer instead of instantly dismissed as off-topic.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:06:00
Ok, so I'm just orders of magnitude underestimating the complexity of the calculations required at this point.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:34:16
But 10 minutes per block is a per-system computational target. If you have 5000 transactions that total 20,000 blocks, yes, each block still takes ~10 minutes resulting in 200,000 minutes of computational time. But wouldn't those 5,000 transactions take a lot longer for 400 miners to process longer than 4,000 miners - just from a parallel processing perspective?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:27:45
Sorry, I'm still not sure I understand. Firstly, what does "secured" mean? Verified? And why would transactions need to be "secured" by multiple miners?
As I understand it, once a transaction block is created via a valid, PoW hash, it's extremely easy to verify the validity of that block by other nodes on the network. 
So since the majority of the work is in creating the initial block for a given transaction, doesn't the reward go to the miner (or miner cloud/network/whatever) that created that block?
I could understand your last sentence if there was no backlog of transactions. If the current hash power of the entire network was able to capture and process every transaction within seconds, then it would make sense to me that this excess hashing capacity simply went toward validating existing transactions. But since there's frequently (persistently?) a backlog, then doesn't that mean that there is insufficient hashing capacity to process all of those transactions? Why WOULDN'T additional capacity mean the ability to process more transactions? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:18:31
Oh.... as a WHOLE. There's a big source of my misunderstanding. Thanks
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:33:47
I think I get it now. 
So hundreds of transactions are all being stuffed together into a single block and added to the blockchain by the miner who happens to first get a valid hash for the next "full" 1MB block. That one block is then accepted by the rest of the network and all the miners have to begin again trying to find the hash for the next block, referencing the hash for the block that was just added. 10 minutes later, one of those miners finds the next block hash and it's added and the cycle begins again.
So a person with a single PC is (short of absolutely amazing sheer luck) likely NEVER going to be the one who finds the next block hash before the next block is added and the block hash search has to start over again.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:50:18
I'm aware of the adjustment, but I'm not clear on your last statement:


But doesn't the transaction being processed require that a miner create a valid block (or set of blocks) to represent the transaction, which requires finding a valid hash? So processing 1 hash/s is not likely to find that valid hash for hours, whereas 70Mh/s would likely find that hash in minutes, or even seconds?
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:34:58
Will do. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-31 14:23:12
Can you expand on what you mean by "hash power"?
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:46:59
Ok, so it's a computationally difficult calculation which involves a lot of trial and error of creating hashes to match a "valid hash" (which can get redefined every 2 weeks based on the protocol). 
I think I get that. But the 10 min thing I've read elsewhere. Is that just an average it's aiming for? So if the vast majority of miners are running on supercomputers and and ASIC chips, taking on average 8 min to find a block, then the protocol will adjust to make the hash more difficult to find? 
So how does that affect someone trying to do transaction processing with just their personal computer? Sure, it'll take them longer than 10 min, maybe even an hour or two, but if there are transactions waiting [10+ hours]( to get confirmed, then isn't that an opportunity for personal computer miners to at least grab a handful of transactions here and there? 
If 0.002 BTC is [too cheap]( to likely get processed by the big boys, couldn't someone with a personal computer (low expenses) try to pick up and process these low-ball transactions to make a few bucks? Sure, it might take 6 hours to process those 6 blocks instead of 60 minutes by the high-speed farms, but just like some people go collect rusting scrap metal to make a few bucks, why aren't there more people that setup passive PC miners in order to pick up some "scrap fees"?
Unless I'm orders of magnitude underestimating the complexity and computational effort in creating a block (i.e. it would take 6 **days** for even a fairly beefy PC to process the 6 blocks in the example transaction vs the 60 min of these farms), then I guess I'm still not clear on why there aren't more trying to pick up some passive money.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:56:05
Ok, but this just opens up an entire new line of questions. That almost makes the bitcoin network seem linear - i.e. one block cannot realistically be started until the previous is found and verified.
How does that type of  ... "collision" (for lack of a better term) not occur all the time even with large scale farms? 
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:41:30


Almost, I'm really suggesting more miners as a way to further distribute transaction processing - and more generally, to diversify the mining ecosystem.
I think I see what you're saying though. But, does that not present a scaling problem as the network gets more and more transactions? If each individual block continues to take ~10 minutes to find, regardless of how many miners and regardless of how many transactions, then as the number of people and companies getting into bitcoin increases - thus adding many more transactions/minute - how would the backlog not become exponentially larger?
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:13:04
A lot of comments seem to miss what I took to be the point: You're not bribing politicians with bitcoins. You're convincing them that they *COULD* get money by accepting bitcoin donations. Suddenly, by accepting bitcoins, they have just legitimized it as a viable currency. 
I/you/we don't actually have to donate bitcoins to them as much as convince them to accept bitcoins, thereby making it very difficult for them to turn around and vilify it or vote to make it illegal later.
