Good for people who lost money? Costly for people who made money? That's how capital gains works.

Here's the thing.  True believers aren't 'losing' by transferring their fiat to bitcoin.  It's when you start thinking of BTC as an investment rather than a transfer of money medium that you become a loser.

Sure. There are also so many loser millionaires that sell cocaine. Look, I'm not saying I don't like bitcoin. I love bitcoin. I'm saying that it's dumb to think of it as an 'investment' because it makes you still think of it in USD Fiat and not in BTC.

So... are you paid on yesterday's rate, or today's rate?  Sounds like a raw ass deal unless you need an extreme secure way of spending (like  for silk road style purposes)

The real problem is that people on this subreddit react to bitcoins as they would stocks.  No one here acts like it's currency anymore.
People are only buying now so that they can see the value go up and therefore trade it back to USD and make a ton of money.  The actual purpose of Bitcoins is supposed to be that we use it to transact. We use it to buy and sell in a large marketplace.  However, with the conversion rate between BTC and USD being so high, people just hoard. Why would any person want to use their 5 bitcoins to buy something two weeks ago when, today, that same product could be purchased for 1 bitcoin?  Why would any company accept bitcoins as payment if a slight crash could cause the value of that bitcoin in USD to go tumbling?
Bitcoins used to mean something. It used to be a movement towards real currency.
Now it's just a bullshit stock that people are raving over trying to become rich in USD.  Dumb.

In that case, pesos would not be a real currency if, in one day, you were paid 1million pesos for 1 USD, and the next day you were paid 1,000 pesos for 1 USD.

People who invest in high risk investments should accept the risk instead of freaking out that their investment isn't immediately worth 10x more.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:11:56
Of course. The hivemind downvotes my submission to oblivion immediately instead of wanting to have a discussion
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:22:48
If that sounds like a bogus fluctuation, look at Bitcoins on 11/1 ($200) and 12/1 ($1200)
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:03:18
Many of them sold all of their bitcoins and cashed out in the Red... heavily in the red. If they just waited a few more months they would've been extremely wealthy.

What... does that even mean?
So a company sold a $1000 camera yesterday for 1 BTC.  Today BTC is worth $600.   Suppose BTC stays $600 forever. Did they not just lose out on $400 USD of value? 
Where does BitPay remove the volatility for that business who just sold for 1 BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:01:17
And this is why Bitcoins will never be a real currency.  Replace "bitcoins" with "dollars" in the statement above.
"Lol, I don't have enough money to buy a whole Dollar (i really want a whole one, I know you can buy parts) so I'm hoping it continues to go down to a point where I can afford one)"
Everyone acts as if it's a stock investment and not a currency. Dumb.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:30:50
I checked the currency exchange 3 minutes ago, 1 BTC = $655, checked again right now - $620.  So in the few minutes that it might take BitPay to enact and transfer the amount (which it may on days with high volume) - the merchant loses $35. 
Still bogus.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:52:15
The main functions of a currency are : 1) Medium of Exchange, 2) Unit of Account, 3) Store of value.
BTC acts as a medium of exchange. You can buy something with BTC and accept BTC when you sell something.
BTC can't really act as a unit of account when it fluctuates SOOOO much within a small period of time.  If I read a brochure from 4 weeks ago and saw that something cost 5 BTC, it might have meant it's value reflects $1000.  However, if I read that same brochure today I might think that the value of that product was $4,500.  There's no way to use it as a unit of account when it fluctuates so much.  It's like saying 4 weeks ago "Hey man, that burger is 5 bucks" and today saying "Hey man, that burger is 25 bucks."  You'd think I was out of my mind.
Lastly, BTC does not act as a store of value.  It fluctuates in value SOOOO much that it cannot be considered to be so.  As a buyer Why would I buy anything for 5 bitcoins today when tomorrow it would be worth 2 bitcoins?  As a merchant Why would I accept 5 bitcoins today when tomorrow it could be worth 10 bitcoins?
Listen... I want BTC to be successful. I really do. I thought it had promise and I was one of the earlier backers of the idea!  It's a great idea and something that will really take off.  However, as long as the value of BTC fluctuates in such an unstable manner... it will not be a proper currency.
TLDR - The only way it will ever become a proper currency is if people actually use it as a currency and not use it as a hoard of value.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:48:46
BTC has never had a store of value since it hit $13. It's been a series of up, downs, and all arounds.

See - everyone on this subreddit are quick to laugh at the guy who spent 2 million BTC on a pizza.  Well? He was actually using it as a currency. Everyone who judges him for having done so is hooked on the fact that USD is the main currency of the world.  SO they preach and preach and preach about how BTC is the most reliable currency, but treat it like a stock and not like a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-07 09:03:50
Why would they do such a thing on such a volatile investment?  I mean, if they were willing to take the risk even AFTER seeing it go from $200 to $1200 in a month... they should be willing to be okay with the consequences of that?
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:10:05
So you don't really use it as a currency. You use it as a medium for transferring USD.  You peg your btc against USD... so the whole point of having BTC as the main currency is moot at this point when you rely so heavily on USD.
Also... if you got paid $30/hour for 10 hours yesterday... your $300 is now worth $150. How is that a rational medium for currency?
