yeah but them snacks make for greasy controllers, gotta bust out some chopstix too

Yeah but it's not as simple as just "autoscale UP when we see traffic spikes"
It takes time to provision and start new servers (even automatically), and when one service gets backed up it can lead to a cascading effect, taking down other systems all of which require headwork and investigation to bring back up quickly and safely, and in ways that are very difficult to predict until they happen. These effects only compound with scale as more and more systems are introduced and start interacting with each other.
Good web companies can do a lot in advance to predict and prevent down time but it's an evolution as the company grows, and a lot of that infrastructure tends to come as the result of hard lessons learned.

Ayyyy lmao it's gonna end just like Christopher Walken from deer hunter too 
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:46:09
Well, maybe the same thing is now.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:39:33
what the fuck did I just read
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:20:05
Haha you poor thing you made %30 profit in a week
@_date: 2016-12-23 09:03:28
Anecdotally, I've been hodl'ing in a blockchain.info wallet for a few years now. Occasionally forget I even have them, but when I go and check they've always been there haha

These articles are so damn dumb. In what world would she not have immediately converted back to usd had she even taken the offer. 
All these "I had x btc in 2011-2012 that I sold and would be worth this much today" are retarded. That's like saying oh man I could've bet correctly on every major sports event and be mega rich if I had known the future like I do now!! Oh man you're a fuckin genius if you know the future wow!
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:57:05
No, i've made stupid returns off bitcoin but this is the sub that should know better than anyone, and instead half of these fucks go full cult mode rather than openly accepting the risks and benefits of the state of things
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:49:47
Why is this sad, and doubly so in the context of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:59:18
Look the reality is the vast majority of people who own bitcoin do not use it for actual transfer of value, they're speculating on it. I bought in the first time at like $12, and I can count the number of times I've actually bought something with it on two hands. The value keeps going up, more people buy in, and that buy in money goes to people who bought in earlier who have now decided to sell. That is the definition of a ponzi scheme. I'm not complaining, and it's not shitting on bitcoin to acknowledge this truth. 
Until bitcoin become widely adopted as a means of transferring or storing value, it will not escape this label, because it is it's definition.

The technology surviving and the price continuing to go up are wildly different scenarios. It's not risky to assume the protocol will not be easily broken, it is risky to assume the price will remain stable or increase
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:54:09
I think what a lot of people mix up is blockchain vs bitcoin. In theory bitcoin could easily be replaced by another currency and become valueless. Blockchain technology is incredibly powerful, but BTC has no monopoly on it. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:56:20
Or he could shut the fuck up and let the technology prove (or not prove) itself. What is a debate going to acheive
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:51:58
This guy gets it. It's basically musical chairs.

Wat -- thought I was on the bitcoin sub
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:38:25
I actually have been wondering for a long time how to read those things, got any good references
@_date: 2017-05-29 21:04:08
Well no, the point is their fees page defines the fee as 1.5% with a minimum of $0.15, which would suggest a $10 purchase would incur a $0.15, not $0.99. Meaning they changed their fees without notice or haven't updated that page.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:49:43
Ahahaha there's the crash I was waiting for
@_date: 2017-05-26 20:58:55
haha middle ground ass me did both
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:56:44
Jesus man change the record. I'm sorry but reading this every thread over and over is getting so old
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:26:18
Not like I'm able to sell the damn things even if I wanted to. Just waiting for the inevitable speculative crash so I can buy more at the bottom again.
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:48:52
That'd be cool
