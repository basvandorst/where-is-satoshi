Euros only and the SEPA transfers usually happen within 3-4 hours to coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:34:32
I think we'll see more in Feb.. cos think about it, it's January.. everyone has "More month at the end of their money" in January..
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:22:31
LOL!! I read that in her voice too...
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:18:21
cheers for this!
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:22:44
n26 use them.. they're a digital bank, and have plans to go into crypto.. they're very fast with and it's all done by an app.. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:11:17
They can't use the following cards
1. Race
2. Religion
3. PC
4. LGBTQ
so they resorted to the Environment card.. literally the last and weakest card in the book of cards
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:58:34
oh ok.. didn't know that about him.
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:43:59
It's mid January.. people have spent a truck load of money over Christmas and New Year's period.. i'd say just relax and HODL until Feb.. and buy more if you can during this "Dip/Crash/Whatever".. the important thing to note is that it's a finite amount.. so just on the scarcity, it'll gain/retain value. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:40:05
we'll see a proper surge/bull run in Feb I reckon.. purely due to the fact that it's January.. think about it, people spend everything for xmas/new year, January everyone is usually "Broke" Payday is soon.. so i'd give it a few more days
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:30:09
 came across this...
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:54:25
yup.. 4PM GMT
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:49:58
for this year. but the problem with that is they may just pump everything again back up over $20K just to short it again from March 2019..
@_date: 2018-06-29 10:19:53
The thing is, i'm not expecting much from that, as it's the LAST one for the year that we need to be looking at. the one that ends on 29th Sept. Cos then after that, no more shorting of BTC by these bastards LOL
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:09:53
when moon? when lambo?
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:20:27
Gonna say this, because I've never said this here..
When Lambo?
@_date: 2018-11-07 09:04:11
BTC/Euro price looking better on Coinbase and Bitfinex too :-)
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:42:55
Seems interesting 
@_date: 2018-02-08 11:50:27
That’s still better than “regulation” ..supervision means that shit won’t go crazy 
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:16:15
true.. we need to stop thinking in fiat
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:56:26
what's the logo of Lamborghini? exactly.. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:15:07
 check the volume
@_date: 2018-02-15 07:19:10
Appreciate the dedication mate! Good luck :-)
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:35:20
Plain and simple explaination.. The Powers That Be know that they won't have the power they have right now if everyone adopts crypto/Bitcoin.. as it's literally gonna be Kryptonite for them.
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:14:52
if that's the case, then why do the "Experts" say "The market is still bearish"?
@_date: 2018-02-01 08:02:39
But hang on.. The EU recently banned all Credit card charges for purchases on anything.. (within the EU).. so wouldn't Coinbase have to adhere to that?
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:11:18
HAHAHHAH Love it
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:03:50
and we've not even mentioned the application of INTEREST on all this Debt creation cycle.. even if all the debt was paid off in the world, where/how can the interest ever be paid? as all money is created out of debt.
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:33:42
yup.. the ones that have the most to lose, will make the most noise
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:48:19
No.. because what Bitcoin is doing is exposing the central banking ponzi scheme by just getting people to put their money into BTC. meaning there will be less money in the money supply. That's why the FED forced people after the great depression to sell their gold.. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:21:56
 seriously look at the history of central banking.. 1913 the Fed came into existence.. since then the dollar's value has gone down significantly.. it destroys the whole myth of "things were cheaper" 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:28:41
LOL.. watching GDAX right now.. the volume is high in the last 15 mins.. and people are pumping back in.. it's now back over €7000 or just over $8800
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:56:25
yup.. it's happening.. iOS 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:31:41
yup.. just went in again with then it shot up!
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:32:27
Well what happened in 2008? That was literally a massive ponzi.. Wall street banksters betted against sub-prime loans, based on Banks lending money they didn't have to other banks and then on to people who couldn't afford to repay the loans made a huge amount of money before the whole thing came crashing down and then we the tax payers ended up bailing them out and paying the bonuses for the execs
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:20:42
Fomosexual LOL! sorry.. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:12:16
buy my first property.. be back in England, or here on the continent.. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:38:17
No.. check this.. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:20:45
wasn't that the whole point?
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:32:11
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:16:01
oh.. so they're basically gonna fuck themselves extremely hard?
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:50:21
 
@_date: 2018-02-10 13:18:09
cheers.. so essentially it's just FUD
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:26:33
Expert or not mate, that’s a brilliant explanation.. thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:09:02
I'm doing points 2 and 3.. and my day job.. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 12:26:18
When is the next "Bull run" supposed to start?
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:40:07

@_date: 2018-07-09 09:37:52
