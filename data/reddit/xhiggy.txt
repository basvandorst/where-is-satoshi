Would you say something stupid, just to see it on reddit?
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:06:24


Ideally, yes. What I'm worried about though, is the peace of mind of my friend who's employee would be using the software. If an unusual event occurred that caused a lengthy delay, which has happened before, they would be distressed because this system they don't understand isn't working the way it usually does. Because of this potential for distress, I would not recommend it over existing services. At any step in the adoption process (which takes time for large institutions), there is a risk the inconsistent user experience will prevent them from adopting it fully. If this happens it looks poorly on me, and I don't want to take that risk.  The problems that prevent me from recommending it have less to do with the technology, and more to do with the confidence in the community to continually resolve problems, while keeping the user experience somewhat consistent. I don't see this happening at the moment.
@_date: 2016-04-27 17:55:05
That depends on how you define ready.
My thinking is that currently, from what I read, the scaling 'solution' is lightning network. To me, this seems like a different landscape of incentives than the ones that created the current bitcoin ecosystem. Because of this, I can't be confident that it will not change how bitcoins are used.

What was your response.
I would argue that an EC patched Core node with those settings would suit your personal needs better.


Nooooooo, you can choose classic, XT, any one of the EC Core patches, or even Core as it stands. However, if the majority of users started to use EC clients, your core software is not flexible enough to track the valid chain with the most proof of work, so unless Core patches their client it will be tough to run a node with it.

How do you define the threshold for decentralization? This to me, is the crux of many people's disagreements.
Edit: Is Ethereum useless? I think it's not nearly as powerful as Bitcoin, but it is a crypto-scheme and is centrally controlled. Far from useless though. To be perfectly clear, I don't want Bitcoin to be centralized like Ethereum, but wouldn't call Ethereum a roundabout version of PayPal.

@_date: 2017-03-21 17:51:26
No, it's the opposite of socialism. Miners are greedy and want to include transactions that pay them the most. The floor will be determined by the miners competing to find the most profitable market equilibrium.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:49:26


I disagree with this, but understand why people are skeptical. I think classics approach is interesting as it amplifies the orphan risk and forces miners to consider the nodes preference.


Yes, blocks will take up more memory. However it makes bitcoin consensus even harder as it introduces another consensus parameter, the idea of block weight. To me this is unnecessary, makes it harder to upgrade bitcoin, and introduces another point of centralized control. It's a worthwhile tradeoff if you plan on using bitcoin primarily to make money off of sidechains large amounts of witness data, however. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:44:25


Wow, thanks for the interesting and relevant discussion that is in no way biased.

@_date: 2017-03-16 21:32:04


To me, it's not 100% clear. Why do you think it is?
@_date: 2017-03-22 00:22:32


Don't give up.
If I understand right, you are saying that block size represents a common resource that we all rely on and that miners draw from individually. Right now the 1MB limit acts as an overlord, controlling the fees indirectly. You propose that by removing this 1MB limit the miners will overdraw and compete to take as much as possible, they will all just want to include as many transactions as are broadcast on the network.
I think this worry is vastly overblown, the main limit to the blocksize right now is the demand to use bitcoin.
Bigger blocks suffer orphan risk, the blocksize won't become infinite as miners would eventually lose potential bitcoin. There is no tragedy of the commons scenario, the limit is some combination of the speed of light, processor speed, memory access speed, all bounded by the ten minute block time, if your blocks take ten minutes, on average, to check it'll be orphaned even if your blocks took 5 minutes to verify you'd suffer heavy losses. Bitcoin needs a large number of independent use cases to maintain it's decentralization, without that we can't rely on miners being honest. A limited block size, is a bitcoin with fewer use cases and fewer reasons to own it and create transactions that drive the fee market. Nothing about a free block size prevents users from using the lightning network if it's useful and cheap to them. Each application that relies on cryptocurrency will make the technical tradeoff about which scheme, ie. coin, to use. If bitcoin is the best it will attract users and grow in price and volume.
I think that bitcoin Core is misguided in their approach to the node network, but use their reasoning to justify keeping a limit in place. They should be thinking about how to attract new nodes, rather than keeping the hobbyist node operators satisfied. To attract new nodes you need new merchants using bitcoin, new projects relaying distributed information innovative uses like that, which are being priced out of bitcoin. Maybe it's worth it maybe not, I think at this stage, it's obvious you can mine profitably while accepting very low fees, so let's keep the innovation going and improve the bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 03:30:02
It won't take very long for permissioned blockchains to provide a better product for most people, than the current fee level. It's a disgusting bastardized compromise.

lol, is that what's happening now? ;)
@_date: 2017-03-21 20:40:21


The Miners have an incentive to RAISE fees until they lose profit. This is where the floor comes from. It's a simple supply and demand curve.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:21:22
This is the security model the Core chain will be relying on. People acting uneconomically out of personal preference providing the hashrate.

@_date: 2017-03-11 18:13:48
You are treating bitcoin like a distributed database. It's not, the incentives are such that you can trust and rely on the miners to be honest about the transaction record, given enough confirmations, assuming you are following the majority chain.

You're right, I shouldn't be so hostile towards intellectuals, they have it tough :/
I guess what I'm trying to express is that in working with these people I have learned that they can become downright obstinate when involved in the nitty gritty of their area of expertise. Anyone working in technology knows that the attitudes of these types of people can slow or halt productive work from getting done. 
I think many people in the space are like this, consider the tone of the forum at bitcointalk, working with them is akin to juggling flaming chainsaws. They lack common social courtesy that people doing business rely on to form a shared understanding of the world at large. Their knowledge helps, but the emotional and social baggage they bring needs to be absorbed and managed by others as they often don't see it in themselves as a problem.
It's not controversial that 'intellectuals' aren't by default the best leaders. It's not uncommon for them to be downright antisocial, old-school cypherpunk or not.
@_date: 2017-03-22 17:34:39
Why would people transact on that chain?
edit: Miners can do anything they want like this now. They can hire devs and get them to code whatever software specs they like. However if the specs become too outrageous users won't send them their transactions and their block reward/fees become worthless.
It's important to deal with this reality, that miners can actually run whatever software they like, early on as it's clearly part of the design.
@_date: 2017-03-31 22:20:33


Can't, literally, argue with that. Fair enough I suppose.

CEOs can be fired and businesses can be sued if they do not act in the interest of their shareholders. It's possible Blockstreams legal structure negates this, but it's not delusional to assume they act as a normal corporation.

@_date: 2017-03-22 07:22:19
One interesting, less extreme example of using the bitcoin blockchain to store data would be hooking it up to sensors that rarely have a reading. When they do, you can be sure the data is captured and stored for all to see in real time through bitcoin transactions. It may be worth it to use the blockchain if the cost of missing the event, losing its record, is very high and likely to happen if stored locally.
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:57:11


If you think a businessman doesn't act with his business's interests in mind you are kidding yourself. I think things such as being so opposed to hard forks, and calling other clients 'attacks' on bitcoin are very questionable, but make sense if you consider that he has an interest to do so.
@_date: 2017-03-21 21:33:05


If miners let the low fee transactions through they will lose profits. Miners want many high fee transactions, not many low fee transactions. What constitutes 'low' and 'high' still needs to be determined.


Again, what do you mean by very low? The fees will be what the market determines, it might be less than now.
Bitcoin is still in its growth stage with a high block reward designed to subsidize transactions and promote innovation. Fees aren't required to secure the network, competition to create blocks is. When there is no, or insufficient, block reward miners will ask for more fees to keep the lights on. Some users will resist, some miners will cave but not all, and an average minimum fee, and subsequent fee market will be created.
You can also run into a limit where the orphan risk of larger blocks, which the node network can influence, keeps block sizes down.
The world needs to learn to use Bitcoin transactions at a relatively low risk, this is what the block reward is for.

Do you have examples of this? I haven't heard the other BU devs complaining about this.


What about Classics approach to scaling?
edit: In case you didn't know, it removes the AD parameter, and replaces it with a parameter that discounts the proof of work score for chains with blocks larger than you expect. Once these chains get built on with enough proof of work it overcomes the discount your node applied and your node eventually tracks it. I'm not a big fan of the AD parameter.

I haven't said this. You must understand though, that as soon as Greg and Adam accepted funding and then took leadership of Blockstream. It is illegal for them to embrace their Cypherpunk roots. They must act in a way that fulfills the obligations of their deal, it's the law, they'll be sued by their investors if they don't.
This doesn't mean that Blockstream represents the CIA, or AXA, or whatever. It does mean that many of their positions are required to be the ones that help their company. Their positions on HF v SF and speaking out so strongly against alternative clients, calling them attacks on bitcoin, is not aligned with their cypherpunk roots, but instead comes from their obligation to blockstream.

Your analysis is missing a few things. You can turn AD on or off, or you can use other clients that don't have AD like Classic. Seems like you would like to turn it off. You can use an EC client to stick to Core forever, but not the other way around, it's just a much safer bet in the long run.

Isn't this circular reasoning, in the context of BU v. Core? If you make a client that doesn't use block size to consider chain validity, then it isn't part of the consensus mechanism any more. 
My understanding of it is that something like the coin generation schedule is certainly a consensus parameter, as miners simply cannot be on the same chain and mine with different generation schedules. A chain with a variety of sized blocks can exist, so I view it as dishonest to consider it a consensus mechanism, simply because it's not required to be.

To some extent I agree with this idea. People who can afford to buy coffee presumably live in a rich part of the world and don't need to use the attributes you mention to get their coffee. However, at the same price point, there are many people who DO need the decentralized trustless nature of Bitcoin as their governments, institutions, merchants etc. can't be trusted. They need north american coffee priced transactions to be economical for them. They are essential players in the growth of Bitcoin as they will learn to rely on it and improve it from that perspective. Bitcoin gets stronger when there are more, diverse users in the market. 


Bitcoin fee markets distinguish by price only, the trade off in security may not be worth it for the reasons I described. A node has a larger fixed cost component, transaction fees are all recurring cost. So maybe it's not *perfectly reasonable.

This is a thoroughly uninformed opinion. Businesses need to provide a CONSISTENT service to their customers. The only way to do this, if your business relies on creating bitcoin transactions, is to bypass broadcasting your transaction to the network and making a deal directly with miners, OR preparing for the inevitability of an unpredictable high fee scenario by ensuring your transactions will get processed during that time by always having a high fee. Neither are good, the full blocks all the time test has shown some bad results.

He has two points: you shouldn't have believed the agreement (could be valid), and no one will fork with you and you will lose money.

It is sound, it just turns out that the allocation of human intelligence is an important factor in determining hashrate deployment between market participants.


Resisting optimizations is the tactic that enables centralization and economies of scale to dominate. The only way the small guy can compete in mining is by being smarter than the big players. If the little guy is sufficiently smart he will become a big guy and his advantage is competed away. This action would make it more expensive to innovate, due to increased risk, and enhance the position of the established players further. Blocking this is clearly benefiting those with the biggest sunk costs, the established players that are the biggest threat to run away with economies of scale and control the network.
I could agree that patented optimizations are bad, however you are arguing for no more optimizations altogether. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:26:20


This isn't the question at hand. 


This premise is not true. Segwit by design requires a huge mining majority to support it for it to work, if non supporting miners don't treat the anyone can spend outputs with respect there will be a fork. This isn't a good design decision, especially when you could do what it does in ways that don't have this problem through a hard fork. There is a lot of sunk cost that went into segwit, which was foolish as it could only work if you have near unanimous agreement between miners. Bitcoin relies on the 51% majority, making something that relies on 95% to work is foolish. They could have made different design decisions but they didn't, it's not political at all. Bitcoins main problems right now are scaling, not chains of unconfirmed transactions (malleability) a block size increase is a simple no-brainer, and it doesn't render the work on segwit to be lost. This is why miners aren't eager to give the segwit creators all of their hashrate, which makes bitcoin exist in the first place.
It's been worthwhile for me to watch you tube videos of conferences where Greg Maxwell and Gavin converse, it helps me understand the origins of this conflict.


This premise is not true at all. It doesn't force them to do anything, it will just result in a bunch of hopeful noobs having their coins be rendered useless. The premise of block-weighting as segwit wants to do, is a threat to the fundamental value of bitcoin. Bitcoin is the minimum cost/resources to transfer value, this can't happen if certain types of data are weighted differently. Sometimes I really think that Greg and the writers of segwit do not understand how bitcoin works or it's aims on a fundamental level.


The signalling mechanism is agnostic to the amount of hashrate, it simply sets a flag day. Why do this unless you don't care about getting a majority. UASF is designed to be a minority fork.

@_date: 2017-04-10 00:40:45
EC lets the biggest investors in the bitcoin space (miners) continue to do so by allowing them to increase their profits.
If the cost of a node increases beyond the benefit it provides the network, then it's resources are priced out and the user needs to reduce their level of security or increase their investment, the bitcoin network needs this incentive to keep nodes efficient and lightweight. The efficiency improvements Core has provided are beneficial in this respect and don't need to be lost through EC.
EC does not prevent a majority that wants to keep the block size small and use segwit from doing so, it actually allows users to express that desire directly. It's a better way to make changes because it will allow miners to get behind it in advance. With a UASF there is no guarantee the person creating the new transaction will have success, perhaps their coins could even be spent by anyone if the transaction format demands it.
@_date: 2017-04-08 12:03:13

Decentralization is not a binary switch, it doesn't get broken so to speak it weakens or strengthens. Centralized currencies are valuable and useful, look around you. Decentralization is not only about cheap hardware, although that is a part of it.
The list is something like:
1. General Acceptability 
2. Portability 
3. Durability 
4. Homogeneity 
5. Divisibility 
6. Malleability
7. Recognizability
8. Stability of Value
Work needs to be done on 1 and 7, 8 will come in time, the rest are there by design.  High fees hurt 1 and 2 and don't enhance any others.
Note that decentralization is not on the list. A decentralized network is required to enable 2,3,4,5,6 and eventually 8.

Sure it can be. For example, Miners can create their own version of segwit, that only accepts transactions that apply a 100sat/kb for witness data, and 400sat/kb for transaction data, if the miner is losing fee money than they lower fees/raise fees depending on volume. If the user is experiencing delays, they increase the fee. The user needs their fee to get accepted, more than the miner needs to accept any one transaction, so they both have power.
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:20:10

Segwit uses 'block weighting' to determine block size with somewhat arbitrary weights. This is a critical change to bitcoin's core properties. Being able to have very lightweight non-mining nodes, the cost of bigger blocks, is not.
@_date: 2017-04-12 16:20:58
No, soft forks that force people to upgrade to fully validate are bad. Hard forks without a hash power majority are bad, which is what UASF is
@_date: 2017-04-28 11:20:12
That is the justification, it's an honest one for sure that isn't decided rashly. I don't see fee management as the developers job, they shouldn't be setting these economic parameters for miners. The fee should be able to be set, with any discount on any type of data, by the miners only. 
I see nothing wrong with offering the segwit weighting as a way for miners to configure their fees.

No one is asserting anything so extreme, neither of us. The problem is that miners do matter in user activated changes. Your coins can end up on a rapidly dying minority chain if you go through with a UASF without miner support.


If the miners don't support the change it wouldn't be wise to create the transactions. The risks of doing so should be at the forefront.

I doubt you'd be able to manufacture enough of it without anyone noticing to dominate for long. Either that or someone else will discover it and implement it better while you are testing it out. The fact that you need to deploy real industrial equipment to generate hashrate is a great feature of POW, and the dominance of ASICs. GPU's provided 100X speedup over CPU and then ASIC 100X over that, another 10X is no problem.
I also think that comparing a 1.2X increase to a 10X increase doesn't help us draw conclusions.

Bitcoin is designed to be money, in the currency market the player that is the most liquid, and easiest to transact in dominates.
The idea that gold is hard to transact and that somehow makes it valuable is ridiculous. Gold is valuable because it makes pretty good money, despite it being so difficult to move around and transact with. Bitcoin is better money than gold because it is easier to move, and cheaper to transact with. It can succeed beyond gold, unless it becomes difficult to move and expensive to transact for some reason.

They don't interface well with the digital world. Bitcoin does.


The fact that bitcoin has value is not entirely related to the extent of its decentralization.
@_date: 2017-04-28 10:59:46
You mean, purse.io would think twice about sending transactions to a minority chain that they can't recover for their customers. The merchants rely on the miners, not the other way around. Merchants are like a hydra, mining takes capital/technical skill etc and is much harder to start up. The power is solely with the miners.

How do you think lightning will help bitcoin. Let's say segwit is activated, what happens to the mempool size and transaction fees, step by step.

Exactly, if segwit was ready a year ago, it would have been implemented no problem. Things have now changed, and the upgrade requirements have changed.
@_date: 2017-04-28 20:02:34
I think in practice that's how it will play out, more transactions at lower fees is the way to go.
edit: especially since there is a substantial block reward in place.
@_date: 2016-09-03 20:04:04
There will be a big block cryptocurrency eventually, either Ethereum or bitcoin. You want it to be Ethereum, that is fine, but your argument is dishonest and narrow in its scope.
What if running a node gave you a reward? perhaps you could buy more bandwidth to support your passion of running a node. Maybe households aren't the ideal hosts for housing node computers, maybe there will be something similar to the relay network to provide node runners with cheap internet. If you realize that bitcoin is just beginning, and has a long ways to go, it's easy to imagine overcoming present day challenges such as residential bandwidth. 
Don't use an SPV client, and don't be so patronizing to someone who is clearly very knowledgeable about this subject. Satoshi chose him, who the fuck are you?
Who cares if this ratio is even 1:1 if 99% of these nodes listen to whatever core does without being engaged in their decision. Nodes run by people who have no idea what bitcoin is, other than it's how they pay for things online, will not help secure the network one bit. In fact it could introduce a ton of vulnerabilities. Focusing so much on one ratio, to act like you are shocked when someone suggests changing this ratio is ridiculous. You are just following the leader, Greg-o.

Ah, so numbers pulled out of your ass.

Most people are turning to credit cards instead, until the transaction capacity increases. Think about this as a business, if you have an application that requires meaningful blockchain transactions it is impossible to predict how much this will cost, in the small block paradigm. Because the blockchain is only able to be relied upon by people with money to burn, no new applications are being developed. Core is making bitcoin a useful tool for bankers only.

Every coin can scale that big. Ones that adopt layer 2 solutions will lose to the ones that do. 
Scaling that big will prevent cheap sybil nodes though so the core aligned are against it obviously.

He forgets a few things in his speeches. Backwards compatibility is not a synonym for a change that does not result in coercion but he equates the two. A backwards compatible change can have second order effects that allow for coercive coordination against the un-upgraded sector. Segwit alone needs 95% to have a chance, they are hoping the proposed 80% number plus UASF will get them there but one must admit it looks unlikely. No one using Bitcoin today wants to raise the 21Million limit, so it's kind of unnecessary to bring it up as a risk.

There's nothing to refute, there is no public cryptographic evidence, all there is is circumstantial evidence. All the circumstantial evidence points to it being Craig, none of it doesn't. 
People are thinking that, because they have somehow decided they are owed public cryptographic evidence by satoshi, a lack of it is definitive proof of fraud, an elaborate, multi-year one at that. This theory relies on the belief that someone clever enough to fabricate this culture of belief around them was too foolish to realize that he'd need to provide some real proof. This belief only makes sense in  two contexts, the first is someone ['doubling down']( on an initially stated opinion. The second if that the belief is not genuine but is deliberately constructed. In this case, it's both.

From what I gather it is important to GMAX that nodes be able to run on lightweight clients easily. He's said this in public many many times. He wants it to be required to have easily spoofable nodes, why? 
Expensive nodes are run by people who can monitor them closely, cheap nodes are run by those who have it on a laptop they use for everything else. Which node is more secure? Growth of users will bring expensive nodes up, but there will be a lower proportion of users running one. I think this is a win-win tradeoff.

The cheaper it is to run a node, the more expensive it is to detect a sybil attack.
It's simple, expensive nodes will be watched and managed carefully, this creates a detectable difference between fake and real nodes.

He has a complete vision of bitcoin, which is impressive at this very early stage of the technology. However, he uses the power gained from this to prevent other visions from being realized. While he may think he is saving bitcoin from certain death by encouraging the core roadmap, he can't guarantee it's success in the fullness of time.
@_date: 2016-07-13 21:27:09
I don't understand why ending the debate, before it's over, would help. It seems like you are advocating a short term gain (being perceived TODAY as a reserve currency) will be better for it. It will help maxwell's company though, for sure.


I think the opposite. I think if you want bitcoin to be too unimportant to replace the usd then you would prevent people from using it. The more people need to rely on the blockchain being accurate, the more robust it will be. Without people using it, who will mine to get fees? Then it's just an expensive server farm.


Which is why Greg has got to go. I think he wants to get a ROI on his company, which requires on people viewing bitcoin as a safe haven TODAY. I am not sure bitcoin is finished TODAY, and could look very different with more people using it and be a better safe haven in the future. Your argument relies on your faith based opinions. People don`t need bitcoin to be a safe haven TODAY, then need it to be useful. Once it`s too useful to fail, it will become that safe haven.
