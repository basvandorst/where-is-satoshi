CTO of Tether is informing that 5 billion USDT was a mistake and that they were intending to mint 50 million.
And the news website writing that the *‘Whale Alert’ twitter account falsely reported a mint of 5 billion tokens sparking a wave of speculation". Whale Alert’ falsely reported,* really?

Obviously a btrash shill.
@_date: 2019-07-14 17:02:32
That was my point.

I agree but I don't think it's going to happen soon. And does it mean that till the time Bitcoin's value doesn't get stable, we will use another medium of exchange like USD or any other existing cryptocurrency, like people said it will be Litecoin (LTC) and Bitcoin will be only used as SoV? 
Another thing is few people will have the Bitcoin in future like few have gold, so we will still use cheap things as medium of exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:31:16
But how many people will be all in Bitcoin? It will be more like gold, few people will have it. And they don't use gold as medium of exchange, so why you will give something that is keep increasing in value.

It's an opportunity for you because you understand it but most people don't. They will realize and understand when they will need it. That's why Bitcoin getting adopted by the countries vulnerable to financial crisis.
