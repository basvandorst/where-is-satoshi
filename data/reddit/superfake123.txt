The US Government provides military assistance to over 70% of all 'abhorrent' dictatorships on Earth. They don't give a single fuck about how good or evil Assad is. They only care that he dropped the petrodollar and how much money can be made from removing him from power.

don't use an online wallet. not your keys, not your bitcoin. use a wallet like electrum.org or samouraiwallet.com. there is TONS of fraudulent stuff out there so you need to double check and triple check you are not getting scammed. be very vigilant. the BEST option is what you should do is download this  and run it offline. disconnect your computer from the internet. generate a seed, 12 words - 24 words, and write it down or securely store it somehow offline. never store your seed on a device that is online. you get a virus or something and your money can be gone. assume that once you put that seed online (to send money) that it is no longer secure and you need to generate a new seed and send your money to that new wallet.
