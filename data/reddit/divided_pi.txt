I would say if you want to know what it's like and you're dedicated enough, I would buy like $30-40 worth of BTC from coinbase or circle or some other exchange in your country. Then buy a steam game with it, use it. When you see how easy it just works (after initial set up), you'll either love it or hate it. 
I knew all the high minded reasons to like BTC (No banks, no Fed , limited supply, etc) but when I made my first transaction and got goods in return I was sold!

Glancing thru your responses not sure anyone has given the full story, if it’s redundant just ignore me
Basically the core developers introduced Segwit about 2 years ago, (honestly probably closer to 3 now), and it was initially sorta accepted.
The  core plan was to merge segwit, then with the malleability fixes of segwit, to work on lightning network for scaling, then introduce schnorr address, and eventually a blocksize increase (basically go for efficiency, then raw capacity)
Segwit also fixed a bug which stopped ASIC miners from mining 20% more efficiently.
The BCH crew argued that segwit was “too complicated” and that it wouldn’t fix the scaling issues, they argued bigger blocks would lower fees and increase transactions per second, which is correct to a point. It does increase capacity, but you also then have transmit up to 8mb worth of data over the internet. 
For miner in places with slower internet connections this can have a real impact on orphan rates and thus profits. Then you have some arguments about harddrive space (which isn’t a big knock IMO storage is pretty cheap nowadays)
But, IMO, the most damning issue is that they haven’t merged Segwit even after forking to save space on their own blockchain and fix malleability. I think this is so they can hold onto the ASICboost exploit for hash rate.

@_date: 2014-12-02 22:16:01
Right, I understand that aspect. But I guess my confusion is coming from the proof of work aspect of transaction confirmation. 
Transactions are confirmed roughly every 10 minutes through mining of blocks. But if there a no more blocks to mine, how are they confirming transactions? Do the transactions them become a block that must be mined, and instead of getting fresh coins the miners would receive the transaction fees instead?
@_date: 2018-05-07 23:38:14
Honestly, a few years ago I would agree with the sentiment. But I think most transactions on the network are likely trading and coming to / from exchanges. I imagine most darknet  transactions have moved to more anonymous coins. 
Of course knowing what the percentages are is a tough one

Hi OP,
Been think about this question for a while now. I'm sure the answer is obvious to people more familiar with the protocol, but how are transactions confirmed after the last coin is mined? My understanding was that blocks being mined were necessary to confirm transactions. 
Or is it simply that with block halving we'll never reach the final coin but just asymptotically approach it by mining 1/2 of it 1/4 of it 1/8 of it etc

Agreed. I'm only a casual observer but when I think about spending my bitcoin my thoughts are "Can I go down the street and buy a beer with it?" In my smaller town? No. "When I buy something online with BTC where does it go?" So far looks like most of the time it goes back coinbase who basically buys it back for Dollars. 
The moral of the story is when I can walk down the street and buy a beer with btc, I'll drink that beer and think to myself "Look how far we've come"

My math might be a bit off, but global gdp (gwp) in 2012 was around 72 trillion. 
Per capita it was around $12,000
21x10^6 bitcoins to fill a 72x10^12 gwp
Right there you get 3.5ishx10^6 as value per Bitcoin 
So assuming all 21 million had been mined in 2012 each Bitcoin would be worth 3.5 million dollars ish. My math could be off, I'm waiting to get my haircut. But gives you an idea

You're partially right. But the point is they are relatively equivalent. For example, an ant can carry let's say 10x it's body mass. For us, that's "not very impressive" because that like a 0.001 gram ant picking up a 0.01 gram crumb. But if we scaled that up to a 250 pound human lifting 10x their body mass, now that's impressive, right? Suddenly that dude can lift a car over his head. 
But they're still 10x increase. But if you wanted to show someone that these two feats of strength are somehow related and can be compared to each other you'd want to use a log scale or something similar to show that, for the ant lifting up that crumb is LIKE lifting up a car for a human. Even though the ant has the advantage of being smaller so it's mass to muscle ratio is different etc. you want to show that these evens are like each other even though they are happening on vastly different scales.
Similarly you want to show bitcoins price has been doubling, or increasing or something, like it has been for 4 years or what have you, even though those price increases have varied in size and scale over the years. 
Does that help or are you just confused by ants and shit now? Lol sorry if that got out of hand

Not OP, but I would assume he was referring to all the peripheral investment in Bitcoin in 2014. Even though price steadily slid throughout the whole year major companies were investing and new products were being developed. 
Obviously the network could ultimately fail. Although I imagine an EMP or something else to be more a more likely cause of death than slow slip into irrelevancy. 
But I think at least short term (2-5 years maybe) that Bitcoin won't be going anywhere soon simply due to the general investment in the ecosystem.
But not being a 4th dimensional being, this is all a bit of guesswork on my end.

In an earlier comment you mentioned that you left public schooling before you lost the ability to think for yourself. 
-what were you learning in school that you felt was affecting your critical thinking?
Trump has yet to release his tax returns. He has also never said a bad thing about Vladimir Putin, while has little issue in personally insulting Gold Star Veteran families, prisoners of war, and American Citizens with little second thought. 
-What do you think of Trumps relationship with Putin, and how do you feel about warmer relations with Russia after our intelligence communities firmly pointed the finger at them for trying to influence the election?
I often hear conservatives say they want the government to be run like a business. To me this means a small group of people (like a board of directors) making all the decisions while the vast majority of voters (low stake stakeholders) has overall little say in the direction of the company.
-is this a good blueprint for government?
If another recession or banking were to hit during Trumps presidency, would you support a bailout for banks? Does his recent decision to rollback banking regulations worry you at all for the financial future of the country?
And finally, what would you like to say to miners who are on the fence about segwit adoption?

My understanding is that segwit would keep blocks at 1MB (or 2MB after a hardfork), but would be able to fit "the equivalent of" 2MB (or 8MB) of traditionally formatted transactions. So I think you avoid a lot of the problems from actually relaying/propagating bigger MB blocks
@_date: 2016-06-15 14:31:56
Fees are just a fact of life for securing the network. I would like to see fees kept as low as possible for as long as possible, but there will obviously need to be some sort of fee market to off set decreasing block reward. Although I think the ultimate win would be if relative buying power of BTC keeps pace with block reward so that miners can almost entirely subsist on block rewards into the future (to the moon).
But assuming some fee market needs to develop I think you need larger blocks to allow more transactions carrying smaller fees, rather than fewer transactions with larger fees. I still have faith in segwit + LN for short to medium term scaling, but I think bigger blocks should be seen as inevitable, just not necessarily an immediate need.

Right, but you can't spend USD in Canada. USD is still a currency, just not "generally accepted" in Canada. 
Bitcoin is a currency, it is not generally accepted everywhere, yet. But its territory is the Internet which is much larger than a single country. 
If you're definition of a currency is "one that is generally accepted",  then please give specific values for when it crosses the generally accepted threshold. 
Is 10% of online merchants above the threshold? 20%? 80%? Is there a generally accepted value for when something is generally accepted? 
If Bitcoin is used by all merchants within a certain IP range, can you safely say that it is "generally accepted by all merchants in this IP range"? Would it then be a currency? Even if it was not widely adopted but generally accepted by a specific subset of the Internet?

How does this relate to bitcoin?
Article is mainly about how abstract models don't accurately predict economic behaviors and that an "agent-based simulation" approach is a better idea. The sorta tails off with a comment about how we shouldn't fire lefties who are always yelling about how capitalism is unstable because they might be onto something?
Just don't see the relevance. It's also ironic because from my understanding bitcoin is a free market capitalist wet dream since no one can tax your transaction (unless you consider tx fees a tax) and being able to freely transact should open up a ton of markets. 
I would also be interested if anyone has any reading on ways that bitcoin and socialism go together etc. something that's been on my mind lately. My gut tells me that bitcoin is pretty much incompatible with other economic models other than capitalism, but I could be wrong.

I think it's only an issue if you want to stay anonymous. Hopefully someone else can chime in, but as long as your private key is not revealed you should not be able to retrieve the private key from the public key. 
So basically say you want to stay anonymous but you use the same wallet to get paid every Friday, if someone knows you make 2.5 BTC every Friday by deposit to a wallet and they see that same transaction every Friday to the same wallet. And that's the only one on the chain which matches that description, then they know that wallet is yours.
But to my knowledge just knowing that does not mean you can steal the coins. They just know that's it's you when money is moved to or from it. And by linking that movement with other knowledge they could learn for example, if you bought a surprise birthday gift because maybe the know the merchants address. Stuff like that.

Just did a browse of his tweets and was seeing a lot of mention of meganet and Bitcoin being separate entities. With headlines from a few months like "meganet and Bitcoin go together like bread and butter". 
I'm thinking he just has different requirements for a secure internet than a secure financial system. I could vaguely imagine a system where a server and client exchange data through a system similar to a micro transaction  channel. Maybe he doesn't need IP addresses because the server and client exchanged public address and are able to send data back and forth as a transaction.

The way I interpret that is his needs are different from bitcoins. I feel like he is talking  about "average block time" type metric, maybe a 10 minute average is too long if he plans on sending packets of data as transactions in his block. He might requires blocks to be mined every 3 minutes or something. I know Bitcoin has a longer average time by design so that stale blocks (proper term?) are prevented, but with Internet data stale blocks might not be as much of an issue since you could retry the transaction, like when a browser retries a connections, or resends packets due to packet lose.

The Swiss tax haven is embracing Bitcoin because it happens to be home to several fintech companies. It's a pilot program from July to end of year to accept Bitcoin to pay for municipal services (water,power,gas?)
My guess is they'll do it through a point of sale company (who knows maybe a local one), and just see how many people use it and if anything goes wrong. The fintech employees probably have asked a few times and maybe some local shops accept it. 
Pretty much a guess, but seems reasonable.

Don't think he would move them because by moving them I feel like it would shatter the "give the world the protocol and leave" mystery he built up for himself. Whether he did it for saftey, or selflessness he did it for a reason. My guess is he bought a bunch of coins when they were a less than a dollar using a real name or another alias and reentered the economy that way. He's probably still Bitcoin loaded, but I think those coins are dead to the real him, presumably like the alias satoshi nakamoto is.
And if it was a group I feel like it would be in their best interests to delete the private keys so they wouldn't have to trust each other not to touch the fortune. Again probably reenter  the economy through early purchases

The miner who "finds"/"mines"/"solves" the next block in the blockchain is rewarded the fee associated with all the transactions in that block. As the other poster mentioned, larger fees are more likely to be entered into a block. 
Fees are sent during a transaction by leaving a certain amount of BTC leftover. 
Example: I want to send you 50 bits
I have 100 bits. I would write my transaction (or my wallet would) such that
You get 50 bits
I get 45 bits in change
The other 5 bits hasn't been "sent" anywhere, so it is now the transaction fee
Hope that helps

It was high, now it’s low, there’s no going back up, go up once, and if it doesn’t keep going up, then it’ll never go up again.
Easy stuff
This has never happened in the history of bitcoin before, we’ve never hit an all time high and crashed the recovered, once it starts falling, it just keeps going
Free falling
Except that time we hit $1300 then had a 2 year bear market which eventually turned into the most recent all time high run.
But outside of that the trend line only goes down

Could be interesting if your phone "earns" BTC micro payments when you're not browsing, then as you browse you "spend" your btc on other nodes you access.
Mainly I'm just tired of these tweets popping up every other day with some vague BS.

Is this one if those situations where lighthouse would be useful?
Sorry for my ignorance

Wonder if you could use GPS as a 3rd signature in a multisig wallet. When the GPS is within [insert GPS resolution here] of the destination the GPS would be the 3rd key?
I don't know much about multi-dog but that's how I would start to approach it

Block reward started at 50, now 25, soon to be 12.5

I wonder if the halving would be the band break signal, or if it would come earlier

In this context he is saying "we longed to see you again 300". If you go on vacation and leave your cat or dog behind you would say "I miss my dog" or "I miss my cat", because you can't wait to see them again and their absence is felt by you.

But can you support sidechain across cosmic distances?

Thanks for explanation.
Although the way you described I feel like the phrase "user activated hard fork" applies more accurately lol. It sounds like you essentially force a hard fork where my chain accepts segWit and one does not, then you bank on the non-SW chain having a higher difficulty after the next difficulty readjustment, and that then gives economic incentive for miners to move to the SW chain eventually making it longer due to higher hashing power at lower difficulty. 
Couldn't miner maliciously mine the SW fork before the readjustment then switch to the noN-SW chain afterwards? (Basically spoofing a higher difficult on the SW chain then using the same incentive to mine the now easier Non-SW chain? 
Sorry if these are dumb questions

Buying BTC is like loaning money to a friend, don't invest more than you're willing to lose. 
Btw I'm not sure if you meant implode (like collapse/fail) or explode (like price going through the roof), so I'll go with implode since that's what you wrote.
I personally don't think Bitcoin will fail. Mainly because the tech itself does actually solve real world problems, and it works. And each day that passes the network grows stronger, it didn't die over the last 6 years even when it easily could've, now it's semi-legitimate, barring a catastrophic code change I think it will last a while. Will it become widely adopted across the globe? Maybe so maybe not. But I think it will be used in an industrial capacity at the least, banks are taking note.

I've heard that the Winklevoss' ETF will be different from the whole GBTC thing, can anyone explain how/why and what it mean? I've heard it's better but don't know why

I think newegg uses bitpay. You should have TXid from the transaction, if you show that to newegg/bitpay it should be sufficient. Does your transaction have confirmations?

thanks, I got everything to at least start up now without crashing. Anyway to tell if it's working?
@_date: 2013-02-13 18:47:54
ok, thanks. I gotta run out now. But thank you for the help

also, should I set gen =0 or 1 for bitcoind? does the p2pool software have its own "gen" option built in?
