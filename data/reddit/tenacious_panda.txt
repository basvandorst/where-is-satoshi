I cashed out on friday at about 5:45 pm, and coinbase said that my withdrawal would be in my bank account today. So far it's not there. Is this normal? Should I inform my bank? The amount is around 2700.

Okay thanks!

Is there a lag for transferring between coinbase and gdax? And when I withdraw, does the price stay fixed to when I clicked withdraw, or does the price change until the transaction goes through?

I just withdrew from coinbase to my bank account. From my usd wallet to my bank account.

Yeah but if the value of those coins changes than I am missing out

Direct deposit i guess? Its just a withdrawal from my coinbase wallet to the linked bank account.

So if it takes two hours for the transaction to go through I might be screwed?

Unrelated to my question about gdax, sorry for the confusion. What I mean is, if I'm on coinbase (or gdax) and sell, but the transaction takes a while, am I subject to the losses (or gains) that could accumulate during that lag time?

I'm not really sure thats why I'm asking. Normally when there are automated transfers, I've had them process in the early hours of the morning so I just wanted to make sure this wasn't anything too out of the ordinary

Can I transfer from coinbase to gdax and pay less of a fee when I sell? Not entirely sure how the two relate.

Thank you. So do I just link my accounts or something? Also, is there a lag time for transferring? And is there a lag time for selling? Ie does the price I sell at lock in instantaneously or does the transaction have to process? And does the weekend affect any of this?
