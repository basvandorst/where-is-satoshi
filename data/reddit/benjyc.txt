G.Maxwell &amp; P.Todd are wrong on this. The basic problem is that you can always hide liabilities. And you need a locking account through some kind of multisig. bitcoin core can't even get the accounts thing done. Appreciate the effort, but we need more high quality work, proper definitions of accounting. I believe the core problem can not be solved easily anytime soon.

"Satoshi's original emails?" which ones are has those?

wildly misleading title of course. anyone who understands the issue knows this will _never_ happen, not in 100 years.

I've been there - they have the largest collection of coins in the world. Well worth seeing.
This was added in 2012. I must have overlooked when I was there. It is very ironic to use physical coins to display something, as this is really the first virtual currency.

well, you have to understand accounting. if exchange X owns 10 BTC and has 10 BTC in liabilities it's net worth is 0 BTC. it still can prove it owns 10 BTC, but it can never prove it does not owe more than 10 BTC, unless all payments go through BTC accounts which are visible. also proving balance is quite meaningless. it does not ensure than debt/deposit holders will get their money. even if it would, you need things like debt priority. and even then you need some type of multi-sig account to ensure that deposit holders actually have valid claims. if the operator of exchange X wants to run he can always do, be it with proof of balance, or without. it's time for  some of these very clever developers to learn some basic economics, then these discussions will be more fruitful.

now I have to trust a webserver instead of my own computer. this makes no sense, as it introduces couterparty risk for no reason. and on top of that there are fees. just learn a) how to use bitcoin yourself b) how to secure your computer c) how to do cold storage

choose two options: 
1. use Visa/Mastercard and pay 2% while getting told what to do.
2. use bitcoin and pay 0% while enjoying freedom.
it does not make much sense for stripe to enter bitcoin in the near or medium term. stripe is essentially a frontend for credit card payments.

not much. this was pretty experimental and not a good idea. web integration is still lagging behind and left to merchant API's. much more interesting is the scripting-engine which is barely used but one of the most fascinating aspects. see Mike's talk from 2012:
