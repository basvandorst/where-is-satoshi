I think the correct translation for "Vollgeld" would be "100% Money" (a term coined by economist Irving Fisher).

I'm not a native English speaker, but does "misleading" imply intent? Something can be misleading and correct at the same time. I just mean that it has a subconscious effect, if you just glance at it and don't think about it.
But good question, I don't know how one could express the value change better.

You can buy your gold directly from the mint. Also, the problem of fake gold bars is usually for bigger gold bars. It's uneconomical to counterfeit small coins.
But yes, absolutely, there are downsides and risks to gold.
Bitcoin can't be falsified, but it also has its risks, doesn't it?

Sorry if this is a dumb question, I am not an expert on smartphones. But the first thing that came to mind was: What kind of sensor data are you collecting? Other than atmospheric pressure, everything else is dependend on if you're in a building or vehicle or outside (temperature, humidity ...), and how can you tell that apart?
It's definitely a great idea though!

Everytime I read an old English book and there's some money transaction in there, I go like "What? Wait. He paid how much? Is that a lot or a little?"
But to be fair, it's also confusing with other old money, like ducats, crowns etc. It's just that the English system changed much later, I guess.

Also the percentages are somewhat misleading. If it goes up 100% and then down 50%, the numbers look like it went up more than down, when in fact we're right back where we started.
@_date: 2014-09-29 11:37:35
You are both wrong! ;-)
is wrong when he says "You just want to get out of FIAT and into Bitcoin" as a blanket statement. If you run a business or have a family, mortgage, car, taxes and the majority of your expenses in fiat, it is absolutely necessary to stay in fiat to be able to afford those things 6 months, 1 year, 10 years down the line. In my opinion, you shouldn't put more into Bitcoin than you are able to stomach losing. How many % of your portfolio that is depends a lot on your life situation (overall assets, age, responsibilities...).
He is right though that "dollar cost averaging", i.e. buying a little bit at regular intervals, is the most sensible strategy, because it is simply impossible to predict future prices. You say there are a lot of ifs and whens in his strategy, but so are in yours! How do you know that the price in 6 months will be lower? It could be literally almost anything. How do you know that "better prices are just around the corner"? That's is gambling just as much as buying now is.
There's a reason why has such a bias towards index funds and dollar cost averaging for investing in stocks, because in the long run that's just the most reliable investment strategy.
And when you use that strategy, and, e.g. buy BTC for $100 every month, prices literally "do not matter" in the sense that they don't influence your strategy or buying decision.

@_date: 2014-10-31 17:05:22
If you own large amounts, then yes. But for the little guy, it's as easy to hide a couple of gold coins as it is to hide a paper wallet. Also, you can put gold coins in a bank safe, where, admittetly, they could be confiscated, but it's still better than paper gold.
I don't buy into the gold vs. bitcoin thing. Both have their advantages and uses.

Well, there are worse kinds of spam than getting sent money, right? If each email spam I received was worth one satoshi, I might already be a rich man, haha! :-)
In the case of my transaction there was a website in the public note of blockchain.info, so I assume that was the point.
I'll still be more diligent about really using a different address for each transaction from now on. I'm a bit lazy in that regard...

Sure, for a comprehensive view, and to see if he loses money or makes a profit at the end, including the investment in the machines is absolutely necessary. But for the decision to keep his machines running or not, he doesn't really need to include his fixed costs (i.e. the depreciation of his machines). As long as his return his higher than his variable costs (i.e. electricity), it makes sense to keep them running. I think that's what OP is trying to say.

Hi! First off, some friendly feedback: There is a display issue with the top menu (I'm using Firefox): 
I don't want this to sound mean, but the major flaw that I see in your concept: Yes, you do make very little money per view on Youtube, but on the other hand, it's much easier to get traffic there, and, more importantly, that money comes from advertising, not for the viewers.
I've been looking into paywalls, because I create a webcomic and am constantly wondering if it might be possible to make more money there. But everybody you ask says that maybe 1% of all fans are willing to pay for your content. Add to that the rather small number still of people who know about and use Bitcoin, and I wonder how you'll ever get even 1% of the views you'd get on Youtube.
Please don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking your idea, but I see that as the biggest challenge and I'm wondering on how you plan to approach it.
@_date: 2014-10-13 12:47:24
I recently asked the same questions in but the only answer I got was not to worry about it.
I received a 0.00000001 transaction from out of nowhere the other day and I wonder what's behind it. Why would somebody send out money like that? Here's the transaction on the blockchain: 
Is this a spam or scam or what? I'm not really worried, I'm just confused.

Thanks! Well, I understand the concept of the blockchain.info spam now. At the price of one Satoshi right now, I'm sure it can be a viable spam strategy.
About the "tracer spam" I get the thing about contamination with stolen coins, although I don't understand what the point is. But I don't understand how my privacy could be compromised. Should I be worried? Will somebody now trace any transactions I make from that address? If so, why would they need to spam me? I thought all transactions were public anyway.

First off: Good idea and good luck with your project!
But! This is a general complaint that I have with many other websites and services. It really puts me off if there is no way to see where this company is located and who is behind it. There's no imprint, no address, no phone number, jurisdiction, nothing.
There are Terms of Use I agree to, but I have no idea who I am entering into a contract with: XYZ LLC in Denver? Rishab in Jaipur? Dimitri in his mom's basement in Nishni Novgorod?
No way I am going to send my crypto or fiat to someone like that.

Any to be fair: The risk people take is just at the size of their current order, so all you can basically scam people out of would be a few days of your gross turnover.
But still, if you make people agree to terms, i.e. enter into a contract with them, you might at least write in there which law applies!

I thought the same thing! Stumbled across the info here more or less by accident. But basically: yes, for every BTC you had before the fork, you have 1 BTC and 1 BCH afterwards. I did manage to sell all my BCH and got almost 10% free BTC for it (BCH price continues to drop...).
For me, as a not very computer and bitcoin savvy guy, it seemed a bit complicated and I was always worried of messing up and somehow losing everything along the way. But I just followed some instructions I found step by step and it worked out fine.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:01:33
It's the old "the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent" adage.
@_date: 2017-10-13 05:44:56


Yes, you do! I'm also not very bitcoin savvy, but I discovered this a few weeks after the fork. In my case, I had my BTC in a Multibit wallet and needed to move them anyway (since the wallet was discontinued). But if you google "mycelium bitcoin cash", you will see a few sites where they explain how to claim your BCH. BCH price is declining, but you should be able to get "free 5% extra bitcoin."
EDIT: as u/pkop pointed out, you only have bitcoin cash for the bitcoin you bought before the fork. (i.e. before Aug. 1, somebody correct me if I got that wrong too).
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:59:04
You're right!! Sorry, I totally forgot about that not-so-unimportant fact! Like I said, not very BTC savvy.

Gotta love the tax code! Fostering innovation by making things simpler, easier and cheaper for all of us.
You're right, I haven't considered that. I have some vague memories about a law or bill that would make exemptions for small transactions, but I can't remember if that was for the US or if it was just a bill that was discussed and not an actual law.
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:54:44
I just had some sort of epiphany why reading this entertaining piece. Usually when I have epiphanies concerning Bitcoin, it turns out that thousands of people had them before me, but I'll ask anyway:
Is there something out there like a reverse Bitpay app? Like a wallet that lets you spend bitcoin and then automatically repurchases the amount, e.g. via your credit card? Because I think the idea of spending and re-buying is good, but I'm sure many people are as lazy or distracted or busy as me and don't get around to do so, and are then subconsciously afraid of paying with BTC, because by the time they remember to buy it back, the price might have gone up a gazillion percent. An automatic re-buying app sure would make it easier to hodl AND spend.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:53:29

Personally, I think it's government crackdown. Now I know that governments can't *destroy* Bitcoin, but imagine if most Western governments simply outlawed it under some pretense. It would prevent regular business from accepting it, and would drive it underground.
I have been studying monetary systems and always wondered how we could break free from the shackles of the oligarchy that owns the banking system and our politicians and, by extension, us. Bitcoin seriously looks like the most promising tool to me that I have ever seen, and that's why I am so excited about it.
But on the other hand, if you threaten the power of the elite, you've got it coming, historically. They won't let go of their power without a fight. And we should not underestimate them.
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:54:37
I just decided to look up the term Brainwallet, because I've seen it tossed around, also the concept of "storing bitcoin in your mind", but never understood how that worked.
Mind blown!!!! How awesome is that?!?!?!
With every little bit I learn about BTC I get more and more impressed and awed.
Sorry, this is probably old news to most of you, but I am just blown away and had to put that in writing somewhere.

Yes, but they are also incredibly smart and have the money to hire the best experts in any field they need. Just look at all the way that the power structure is using technology against us.
I hope I don't sound pessimistic, because I'm not! We should not feel intimidated. I'm just saying, I don't put anything past these people and I would not be surprised if they try to squash Bitcoin like any other alternative currency that popped up over the years. We must always be vigilant!

@_date: 2013-11-26 11:29:34
But with other currencies you usually don't use the s though, right? Like "ten Dollar" or "twenty Euro".

Thanks! This is awesome! Exactly what I was looking for!
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:18:42
So with this great price differences, is anybody aribtrage trading out there?
For those who aren't familiar with the term: An arbitrage is basically a price difference. Taking the example in the WSJ article here, you could buy 1BTC at Bitstamp for $1,039 and sell it for $1,172 at Mt. Gox and make a risk free $133. All you have to do is be quick enough.
In "normal" finance it's done all the time. Some bank's supercomputer moves around a few million dollars around the globe, going through three different markets in the blink of an eye and taking a risk-free, albeit small profit. The justification is that this brings equilibrium across markets. In our example, the price on Bitstamp would rise due to the increased demand, and the price at Mt. Gox would fall due to increased supply.
I'm just curious if anybody is doing this with BTC already. I'm pretty sure someone is.
@_date: 2013-11-17 20:23:06
I always wondered about that!
I imagine that it's hard to draw the line though and there's a grey area, isn't there? If I'm a trader, it's pretty obvious that a capital gain is my intention. But if I'm just a regular Joe, how is it determined what my intention was when I bought Bitcoin? If I buy a stock, it's clear that that was done as an investment. But what if I just bought a couple of Bitcoins out of curiosity or to buy a pizza or make an international payment and I just lucked out?
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:32:50
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:02:24
Okay, well, thanks! That's why I'm asking, because in German you don't use the s. If you say "ten Euros" it means ten single Euros, not just the amount.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:42:35
I have my own little online shop and am considering to change to a new system. That's mainly because of tax reasons (my current system doesn't allow me to apply different levels of sales tax), but also because I would like to be able to automatically receive Bitcoin. I am looking into [foxycart]( right now, because it offers Bitpay as an integrated payment gateway. Of course, if you use something like this, you have a monthly fee ($20 I think).
Haven't tried it yet, so I can't make a full recommendation, but I just stumbled across it yesterday and thought I'd share. Definitely looks like a cool (and versatile) service though.

Well, I think I would theoretically be able to think up a *pretty* secure passphrase. If you use a rather random sentence, more than one language, change the spelling of some words etc.
It all depends if the risk is worth the trouble. If I was to ever store a significant amount of money for a significant amount of time, I assume it would be prudent to use the diceware approach.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:29:35
I feel for you, man. But it's not as if Bitcoin ruined your life, it's that you made a mistake and now beat yourself up about it. The same thing could have happened to you trying to buy shares or trade options etc.
Everybody makes mistakes. Absolutely everybody. And the trick is to not fall into the "coulda woulda shoulda" spiral of despair, but to accept your mistake, learn from it, look forward and move on.
I wish you all the best, and hope you find some emotional rest soon! To end your life over something like that, would be an even bigger mistake. Don't forget about the people who love you!

@_date: 2013-11-20 21:26:36
Awesome! Thanks for taking the effort to write this! I'm not an American citizen, so I ask this out of academic interest:
Exchanging BTC for goods and services is regarded as "realization". Realistically, how would this work in practice for people who use BTC not as an investment, but as a currency? E.g. I'm a freelancing web designer and have 5 incoming and 10 outgoing payments a week. Everytime I spend 0.02 BTC on a pizza, I have to take this into my taxes? And how do you determine which BTC are the ones I spent? Is it from the 0,6345 BTC I made yesterday, or from the 1,395 BTC I got as a gift from grandma last Christmas? Is there some FIFO or LIFO logic behind this? This sounds like an accounting nightmare in practice!
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:04:14
Yeah, now that I think about it, I have heard that many times before with Dollars. It's the language barrier! In German you'd say "zehntausend Euro", adding an s would be wrong.
Thanks for the language lesson! :-)
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:03:34
It's like you've created a Bitcoin derivate!
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:20:15

@_date: 2013-11-26 12:12:06
Right? Me too. But my tendency comes from my German background and I don't want to tell English native speakers how to English. :-)
 
But I think especially nowadays, when the amounts you spend are probably under 1 BTC, it is more logical to lose the s. E.g. "0.3 Bitcoin" sounds more logical than "0.3 Bitcoins" to me.

It's not easy, but it's doable. If buy 10 BTC and put them in a savings account that accrues 5% interest, you'll have over 21 million BTC in just 300 years! ;-)
