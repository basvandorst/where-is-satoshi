I hope so.

Did you get raped by bitcoin cash or what. Why the condescending tone. Bitcoin Core is congested and broken at the moment and it looks like it's going to continue. 20cent and wait a whole day or what? no zero confirmation transactions because of RBF. ATM bitcoin core is only living on the hype that the term bitcoin is bringing it, in reality its the most dysfunctional coin in the market.

I am not a wizard. All I can say is lower than 7k.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:41:27
That's why I didn't want to bring bitcoin cash up. I can crush you with arguments and evidence against what you said but then this post will turn to a completely other discussion so we will stop this convo now, no replies for you except PM.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:29:35
tell me how 100kb, 1mb, 2mb, 1000000mb block size affect empty blocks.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:46:33
So what's your plan? enlighten me. r/btc answer my questions without hostility. r/bitcoin censors and is very hostile. I can't even mention certain things because I don't want to turn this post to flames. Enlighten me on how the future of 1mb and alienating miners is going to turn out.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:37:34
Exactly. I can't think of a way where the interests of the miners conflict with the coin or the users. Miners can't make money without a successful coin, which means they should be pushing for it's improvement. Can someone explain whats going on?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:39:22
Just don't mention in, fuck paying taxes no one will know. Unless you have $1m dollar worth of bitcoins then yeah
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:58:39
never said that. how is segwit 1x/ 2x related to empty blocks. It's an issue of its own. I agree it needs to be fixed but it's not related to the issue we are facing today.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:15:17
You really are a dumbass. Exchanges will close for at least a week. Once they come back there will be 2 bitcoins to return from (that's if one of them doesn't dud). It's impossible to short something that I can't guarantee will exist after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:04:32
Clean your monitor you pig
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:47:31
Store them as bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:35:43
Seriously explain to me how you would short bitcoin right now. Assuming bitcoin goes to 6k on 15/11 right before exchanges close.  How can you turn that to profit, tell me. I want to make money. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:20:45
Still not convincing. Where do you think the money would go instead of going to the miners? to Blockstream?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:28:17
Why were people selling for 11-20 dollars while people were selling for 120 and buying at 118
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:22:55
not a dude
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:16:59
So some say miners want bigger blocks for more transaction fees, and some say miners want to mine empty blocks. You are not making sense. Empty blocks are not the majority because they exist because of a loophole (spy mining) AFAIK
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:18:35
Thanks. Your comments are very helpful.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:35:29
played by who, and for what gain? elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:33:27
Thanks for your comment. I am trying to 'gobble up' both sides, I have to relay their arguments to get counter arguments. That's what a good interviewer does. I am basically an interviewer here who doesn't care about convincing anyone here with my ideas because I have non, I want to absorb information from both sides. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:34:50
isn't that also what's best for bitcoin? explain how these two interests conflict?
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:21:31
Short BCH, it's free money? right?
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:16:47
Yes millions of tethers artificially changing price.
@_date: 2017-11-04 22:57:02
oh boy. when it forks to segwitx1 and segwitx2 you would not get 'free' bitcoins. If you spend on either chain then it will be spendable on both.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:19:40
It's still way to early for that. I set up a reminder so you are relieved of your duty. I made profits in the increase of bitch cash (which I am holding), so I am actually up and happy. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:15:30
I need to give you arguments I heard in r/btc to get more out of you, but I had enough of you since you are just useless. Get lost.
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:28:18
When is the LN coming, whats your plan for 1mb $5+ fee shenanigans? its only going to get worse. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:58:14
Wow mark my question FUD, what a bunch of sheep you  all are.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:08:26
Technically I can't. Practically I can. It's like guaranteeing that throwing a handful of coins will not all land tails. Core team is considering changing PoW, Segwit2x has majority of support (supposedly), no replay protection, and you think all of this will not affect the price of bitcoin? ok... keep dreaming
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:34:14
I didn't say it will be back, why would I short it. It will go down, but I am not sure if it will be back again after the segshit1x vs segshit2x blood bath.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:20:07
Neither. I am holding bitcoin cash (don't hang me). I think bitcoin core has a chance but its guaranteed to drop in price right before the fork. So if I would buy btc I would buy it during the panic before exchanges close.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:00:45
come discuss on pm. I won't put my dick in the r/bitcoin bee hive.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:07:43
Sorry but that makes no sense at all. I don't want to go into why so this post wouldn't derail. Thanks for your opinion though.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:00:15
"The fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 210 satoshis/byte, shown in green at the top.
For the median transaction size of 226 bytes, this results in a fee of 47,460 satoshis."
@_date: 2017-11-08 05:25:02
Thanks for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:26:15
How is paying a fee for the miners a bad thing. It's part of satoshi's plan to have miners profit from fees only in the end. Segwit1x made the blocks so small and fees so high so blame core. Bitcoin Cash has 8 mb and it's working so much better. Empty blocks are another issue that will happen regardless. Spy mining.
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:24:52
Is that by bitcoin design? or is this a special event?
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:47:17
I guarantee you that bitcoin would be cheaper around the fork date. I can't say what the longterm would be, but next time study the market and enter at the right time.
RemindMe! 9 days
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:03:48
I can't guarantee it will be there after the fork, but I can guarantee it will go down. So it's not free money. I am willing to bet you $1000 dollars bitcoin will be less than 7000 before the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:14:31
Being a node that doesn't mine makes you a useless parasite.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:33:32
I can give a reason but I don't think it will matter to you. Lets just wait 2 weeks it's not a long time to wait.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:44:05
South park is so edgy right now if they made one they would probably shit all over bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:39:23
Just why is 8mb or 32mb limit a bad thing? wouldn't that solve the congestion and lower transaction fees? Even old computers can handle such sizes easily. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:19:55
I am here to absorb not to debate. I am just squeezing more point of views on the issue.
