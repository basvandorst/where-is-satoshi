I don't even know you could choose your protocle of transfert where you select that ?

Exactly I struggle to understand this notion of fees on top of bitcoin reward and what is the exact computation for this fees to be higher and why 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:50:55
Can you elaborate more ? sorry I don't get the whole picture 
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:58:32
is there a standard number of transaction that can contain a block ? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:51:28
yes but that will be much less interesting and so the computational power will drop and so the speed of the chain, no ? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:11:24
Ok thanks for your answer. i looking at this explorer and see that size of the block are even different. I'm a bit confusing about seeing block not of the same size length. Can you elaborate a bit more on that ?

Ok so if I understand well well, Alice send 1 BTC to bob on the actual bitcoin network.(transaction is signed by Alice with her private key)
Then bob decided to replicate this transaction on BTC X2 to receive 1 BTC too is that right ?

that would weaken the network and allow people who used to have big computationnal power to switch them on again when they see that they could have around 51% of the whole blockchain power

It was a typical wedge breakout pattern, this market start to be more technical till more financial guys are coming in with GS and JP opening desk on these markets

yes this is the point from my little knowledge the segwit2x protocol would be more scalable than the original blockchain of the bitcoin and so allow more scalable app to be built on it. I mean every change that imply mainstream adoption would be following me more valuable than old standard. that's why if they made a BTC1 and BTC2 I don't get why the BTC1 would be still competitive on the long run ? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:23:31
this is my question how they send them through API or normal front end access ? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:12:08
I mean how the execute order ? because there is a lot of different exchange with all their respective spread and amount tradable 
@_date: 2017-10-29 15:05:52
can you elaborate on that with an example please ? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:16:23
Technical analysis is working really well on such assets where there is no HF trader yet .
@_date: 2018-12-19 20:49:44
Good luck with that then !

You can buy as much as you want, but you need an exit strategy. I do not one trader that buy low and sell at all time high, your goals should be to scale out and again scale in to get back in.
You are already scaling in every month so why not scaling out on breakout ?
Your average would be way better like this
