No it makes no sense. An asset growing at a constant continuously compounded rate or return such as the inflation rate will grow exponentially. So the fact that the growth is exponential has no bearing at all here.
Different assets tend to provide different returns according to their risk. You can look up the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Stocks don't really reflect the overall growth of economy. They reflect the growth of the companies they represent and they're overall a risky asset comparing for instance to government bonds. As such you need to expect a higher rate of return from them.

Inflation is the overall increase in the price of a basket of general goods and services. 
Stocks reflect the expected future value of particular companies listed in the exchanges. The future for these is more unpredictable and commands a high risk premium. Historically it has been observed that certain indexes like the S&amp;P500 which represents pretty much the companies that are doing well (so some selection bias) has grown higher than the rate of inflation.
When you say "beat the market" I get the impression you mean inflation. A stock beating the market is usually construed as beating an index like the S&amp;P500 whose rate of return has historically been significantly higher. As you say there is no expectation that they should beat this index but it's almost guaranteed the index beats inflation and so will the average stock.
