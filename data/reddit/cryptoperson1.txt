How about making an exchange with your father, doing chores for bitcoin.  If you do decide to go this route, be aware that at the price the coin is at presently you may be at your Dad’s beck and call for the foreseeable future. 
Good luck!!!

Like any new technology it takes time. I think about it as the three stages this crypto technology has to go through for a successful outcome. 1:  optimism, 2: pessimism, 3: acceptance.
Once Cryptocurrencies become ingrained in people’s psyches, part of normal every day conversation, considered fiat, then the transformation of the world’s currencies can begin. Until that evolution takes place educating the public about this amazing blockchain technology is the way to go. 
Patience is a necessary requisite when taken on the global monetary system.

Market manipulation occurs in all trading platforms to a certain degree. Just take a look at the world’s markets, the large electronic trades that from time to time are responsible for wild swings in individual stocks. If It wasn’t for regulation these occurrences would happen almost daily.
Cryptocurrencies are experiencing this on a much larger scale. Until controls are put in place, these wild fluctuations will continue to be observed. The big debate is how much governance will blockchain cryptocurrencies ultimately have, how to keep this new technology which was created to be free of government control from being over regulated.

Flowbrother, being antiestablishment is a good thing, that’s how major changes are made to the world order so that every one gets a fair share.
But think about what you wrote, would any dissident comments such as yours be tolerated in a dictatorship. Honouring those lives who fought for our freedom is the least we can do!!!

Chocolatesouflle3, I am not sure what you mean by that? If you are trying to say that this board is about Bitcoin or antiestablishment, I get it. But honouring the brave souls who died so that we can express these views without reprimand, fear of imprisonment or even death isn’t too much to ask.

The answer is two fold. 
Firstly, the coins are in your private hopefully hard wallet, safe and sound, out of reach of scrupulous individuals. 
And 
Secondly, transactions are immediate, only known by you and the party at the receiving end.
It’s all about privacy and ease of use.

Crypto blockchain technology in general are changing how populations spend and save. So many around the world do not have bank accounts and credit cards, living from hand to mouth. Cryptocurrency gives them some power, the ability to buy everyday necessities and even safe a little, all done with the privacy of a cryptocoin wallet.
This technology is a godsend, it will level the playing field that for way too long has left the majority of the world’s population “out to dry”.

The first rule in cash transactions is never take your eyes of the money!! To guarantee there are no distractions, going with two or three trusted individuals, each one with his or her predetermined role will lesson the chances of a scam as the one you described succeeding.

Sporklin. Get off your high horse and relax a little. Where is your sense of humour, my post was obviously meant to be funny.

Claymore, thank you for your reply, every comment received is appreciated. I have a question for you.  What are your opinions about  the present monetary system, about changing to a crypto based one, are you for or against it?

Further more, there are approximately 860,198 subscribers, how many do you think are developers. Give me a break!!!
This is a message board where opinions are expressed and shared. Yes there are posts that are are meant to educate, but for the most part the board is composed of individuals who have a common interest, nothing more!!!

How is one to know for sure whether these wallets have been tampered with? I would only buy the ledger nano hard wallet directly from the manufacturer, it’s the only way to safeguard one’s coins.
