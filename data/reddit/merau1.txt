Seriously, who is stepping up on Bitcoin side to talk to the masses.

I do get that the devs should get on with the job, but some form of leadership authoritative person should be available to defend the truth and call him out on blatant lies.
People who matter is everyone, and general public and new people should not be able to have lies pushed on them so easily through mainstream media sources.

Who is representing Core team? The problem is that very can spread his agenda without challenge on mainstream information sources.

Anyone with half a brain should see him and his scam coin for what it is, and that is him lining his own pockets. Please continue to share and spread the information to the masses that this man cannot be trusted.

The problem is that this moron is allowed to spread his agenda without being challenged. Who is representing the Core team? I never seem to see anyone from the team posting or addressing things publically.
Someone needs to step up to to the plate. The community also needs to do it's part and step up it's marketing against this man. Play as dirty as he does create an Bitcoin Cash domain and paste all his lies on it.
