This is the wrong answer, you should educate yourself: 
BTC -&gt; ShapeShift -&gt; XMR -&gt; xmr.to -&gt; BTC
ShapeShift is a good service, but xmr.to actively tries to protect your privacy by not trading the coins immediately, so it's the right way to handle it at the end.
Also with this route the slippage is minimal and the process is easy.

This breaks  of the community guidelines in the sidebar: 'Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere. For example, is a good place to discuss all cryptocurrencies.'
I had my post removed by the mods (I linked to the LetsTalkBitcoin podcast about Monero's approach to block size scalability) so there is no reason this post should stay up.

It's shit, doesn't provide any actual anonymity, and it doesn't protect your IP address at all.
[If you want anonymity then this is what you're looking for](

I'd never really researched Monero at all, but as someone who is on the fence about the block size limit they have this really cool idea where the block limit grows dynamically based on use.
They also speak about Monero and Bitcoin privacy in the interview, and it was explained in really basic terms which helps us who aren't really familiar with the technical things. More to the end they got too advanced for me:-)
Have the Bitcoin developers considered a solution like this dynamic resize system?
