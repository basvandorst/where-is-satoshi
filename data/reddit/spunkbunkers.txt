I'll look into it. Thank you.

I'm going to try, but from what I've seen today, their support is pretty poor. My fault for not looking into it first.

It would seem so...
So I went to gdax. Looks much better. Logged me right in, too. Weird. Same cookies used for coinbase?
There's no money in there, though. Does my usd wallet transfer?
I appreciate the help. So many questions. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:29:31
Ah. Gotcha. Why the change in name and fees for the same company? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:37:43
Their fee was taken out of the amount that went to the wallet already. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:03:25
Nice. Just noticed. Different company, though? Or just different name? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:15:52
Awesome. Will do. I appreciate that. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:04:02
I'm all gdax now. 0.00 for those bastards at coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:17:38
Got it. Awesome. I'm reading.
I'm gonna give it a shot. Thank you!

Like a kindergartener who superglued a pencil in their hand
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:15:12
Of course! I'll see you in the millionaires club in a few years
Edit: Thank you for the welcome. I finally did it... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:36:07
I suppose I did. Microsoft of the 21st century, here I come! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:47:20
Thank you.
Unfortunately, I don't have any ugly sweaters to feed your fetish. I apologize
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:44:24
Haha. Just hold into it. You hold me up and I'll hold you up. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:18:44
My expectations exactly. I'm going to slow drip funds in monthly, up or down. I've been naive to hold off this long...
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:32
Just bought my first 200 bucks worth. Either way this goes, I'm ecstatic to be a part of history. Thanks for being in it with me, family.
