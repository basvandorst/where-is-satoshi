Lol. Do you have no hobbies? Or friends? Jesus Christ, what a typical "everyone else is inept but me".


On the contrary, crypto-currency is the most efficient, non-violent, voluntary means to cut the government off at its source: its ability to steal. Police and soldiers don't work for free. You tell me now that standing up against the government is productive, and then every 4 years you're the guy saying "come on guys, we have to vote for the lesser evil", you don't see the disconnect there?

I've been getting good responses to explaining it in terms of PayPal. "Think of your paypal account. You jump through some hoops to convert dollars to 'paypaleons' which is completely virtual. You go on shops like ebay that take paypaleons, and by using paypaleons, you have a more streamlined interaction, less fees, etc. If you want to spend your paypal account money elsewhere, you need to transfer it back to dollars." Now, of course PayPal calls their denominations dollars, but it helps curb the "but where does it get its value from" questions, as well as the "but I like cash in my hand" complaints.

How many bitcoins are still yet to be created? Could the gov turn university supercomputers on to bitcoin mining and own 50% of bitcoins?

Too bad making them is easier than you think.

No, there's a very easy way to keep everyone happy: LET THEM DECIDE HOW TO MAKE THEMSELVES HAPPY. If you think your taxes are put to good use, you can continue sending the government money. [Here you go]( If your argument somehow rests on the idea that government can only solve problems through coercing people who don't agree with you, that is quite immoral.

I'm curious why do you support bitcoin adoption if fiat currency is the method of funding the state, which you support? Mass adoption of bitcoin is a death toll to the way the state can function on its most basic levels, it would have to be voluntary donation. If you believe you have legitimate claim to another person's brain wallet, how are you going to get it?

lol. wut.
Your state imposed education has taught you mental gymnastics very well. There's way too many buzzwords in your post to not be a troll.
Just for fun.


As if none of those things would exist without government. There are already private roads, schools, libraries, regulations, licensing, security, investigators, food regulations, medical regulations, scientific research, low-income help, job-seekers.


There's that key word, "fair share". What the fuck does this even mean? If you average out the wealth of the world over 6 billion people, your "fair share" would be a hell of a lot less than what you own now, you know. I'm sure your running to your nearest government office to give them all of your extra possessions right now!


Well, let's look at the textbook (google).


Trying to justify your right to other people's money on some implied consent by being born doesn't seem a bit more of a stretch of that definition than making people pay for something they didn't ask for?


Opting out of the duties that we've assigned to each citizen together and as a society can't really be construed as anything but selfish in my mind. That's like saying that you don't like the way the DMV allocates funds so you take the "high road" and drive without a license. It's simply not a consistent argument based on any moral standard that I've heard.
When you think of a system that doesn't require violence and indoctrination of children to minimize externalities, let me know. Until then, private charity is the only system a morally consistent person can advocate.

This is a big deal to those prescriptivists out there.

And I work doing federally funded research. My alternative? Working on the "Like" button at Facebook making four times as much money for the same number of hours. What I do is funded by taxes, and for the pittance that's put into our programs I think much more value is added to society as a whole than would be had that amount been allocated to an entity governed exclusively by the free market.
You don't think you might have a conflict of interest here?


Ok, there should not be implied consent, and opting out of things you want to pay for. There is the much superior system of opting into the things you do want, by paying for them. 
You invoke the middle ground fallacy. There isn't a happy place of "stealing less", there's stealing or no stealing. You want a happy compromise? You keep paying your taxes like a good citizen, and leave alone the people who don't want to.

Makes sense. People often forget that they're allowed to prefer different political systems depending on the "tier" they're discussing. The world as a whole is fairly anarchic, while "national" levels are not. I'd like to see anarchism take hold on most levels up to the size of a city district, where "you can always move" is a much more viable option. I might try a socialist commune just to see how I liked it.

How do you say something so ridiculous up there and then come back with something worth a libertarianbestof!?
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:17:28
Do you even voluntaryist, bro? I ended up voting Johnson, but things like the FairTax fly in the face of market anarchism. Not to mention it doesn't seem like GJ really comes to libertarianism from a morality basis, which might turn off deontological ancaps quite a bit. With his form of consequentialism, he was a lot more risky than RP in terms of possibly changing his views later for pandering points. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 15:45:10
So if we don't vote, we don't get suppressed under the voters' system? I'm fine with that. But wait, the people that vote get to rule over those that don't anyway, fuck that.
