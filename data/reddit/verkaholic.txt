Yes, everything is a pump. Yes. Charities = pumps.
Yup, no one ever posts anything that isn't a scam or pump.
You are 100% right. Yup. You know everything.
Definitely not someone trying to cram sense in you insecure, petty little angry heads over here. Nope. Because that's impossible.
Try changing your whines a bit so we don't get board.  Maybe it isn't "another dogetard scam pump post" but its a "federal false flag crypto sabotage".  That sounds good right?  At least then you robots look like you can be creative.

ZZZzzz.... you need a new line this one is getting stale.
You know, reddit was made to be a democracy. If you aren't getting enough upvotes it's simply because not enough people like you.
If "dogecoiners" are over voting you, then you are weak. 
It's all built in.  Get some fanboys on your side. You can do that, right?

It's a cheap copy-paste derivative clone of an "ok" movie.
The comic offers nothing new, and does not innovate. It's essentially a copy cat clone of the movie, and serves to detract from people who like the movie.
With this comic in circulation, people might mistake it for the original movie, thus bringing down the original movie's value.  This comic should be killed or banned because I don't agree with it.
Sound familiar?

Well, you are wrong and look like petty little crybabies.
There is so much good going on at Dogecoin, I can only assume its jealousy. Using and open mind, one can see the massive benefits Dogecoin has for Bitcoin.  
You guys act like spoiled children, mad that a neighbor has the cool new toy too. 
Continued insults on the intelligence of dogecoiners just shows YOUR lack of intelligence. There's plenty of super smart people. Every reference to "dogetard" makes you guys look like little high school kiddies. Stop, you look stupid doing it. If you don't think there's plenty of intelligent people in the Doge community, then you definitely are as stupid as you claim us to be.
In any group, there are idiots and assholes. This includes bitcoin, as is obvious by this post and comments like it. Dogecoin has it's idiots too, I like how you focus on them, and none of the charitable acts. Great filtering.
I'm done with you. Tagged as bitcoin fudder fanboy.
