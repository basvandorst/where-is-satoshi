The idea is to check if the order was processed, if not cancel de last one and set a new one with the new price or even a few cents por expensive/cheap in order to make it easy to execute the order. 
The problem is that there is no direct sell/buy in the bitstamp api, so the only option is to use the limited sell buy to achieve something very similar.

I am paid for the hours I work, so my idea would be to quit working 2 or 3 hours a day to develop this software. My idea for the stop loss would be to cancel the actual order and set the oposite one at the stop loss order price. The hard point would be to ensure than this new order is executed. If the price keeps dropping/rising it will make a new order on the new price to make sure that you leave the position as close to the stop loss operation price as possible.
