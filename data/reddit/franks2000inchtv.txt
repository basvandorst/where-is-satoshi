Not if they sell it to themselves, realize a tax loss, then buy it back from themselves at the higher price.

Because the it's 20%-30% of actual *real-money* liquidity in the market.
Most of the market cap is invented. Hell something like 30% of it was bought for pennies and lost forever.

The underlying metaphor of bitcoin is gold mining, so yeah...

They only have to spook the herd, and the stampede will take care of itself.

But it's possible to create phantom taxation for yourself, where you owe capital gains taxes on gains you realized in 2018, but no longer have the money to pay for in 2019.

Why would anyone want stupid old dollars ever again?

Because most of this stuff is unlikely to result in recovery — so the lawyer is unlikely to get paid.
Ambulance chasers are looking for quick, easy settlements, not to break new ground in crypto suits against foreign corporations in areas with different levels of commitment to the rule of law and accepted accounting practices.

This screams "stable currency."

That ten percent is real money. It can buy food, or pay rent.

It’s the case for literally everyone. Money is fungible. If it’s not rent and food, then it’s a dinner out, a new TV, a vacation.
This is a thing a the poker table — you lose a little and you think “might as well lose it all” but you need to remember those are actual dollars.

Yeah, the US dollar is stable and no one wants or uses that garbage. (Except for the trillions of dollars used every day.)

If you saw people driving towards a cliff shouting about their Ford Focus can fly, you might wave your arms and try to get them to stop.

It takes exactly zero courage to play blackjack.

No one wants a currency that fluctuates rapidly in price. You’re talking about bitcoin like it’s an investment, but all of the investment value is based on it being a currency. And it’s a terrible currency, so it’s a terrible investment.
A technology that has had billions of dollars invested over ten years and still hasn’t found a good use case is a failed technology.
Get your money out while you still can.
