Trading is not difficult in a bull market, and you don't even need TA.  You could literally buy any pullback on the S&amp;P 500 over the past 3 years and 99% of the time you would have profit eventually.
Also, take a look at the SPY chart from May 4th.  We get a hyper-bull day like that at least one a month, and you can tell when its happening because there are zero pullbacks.  If you simply wait for those days and go in large you can make consistent money.

You lost me at "TA is garbage". TA makes me money every day.  You dont need to outsmart any person or computer, the basic principles are dead simple.

Wait for it to go up, then buy the dips

You are talking theory.  Please give a specific example.  You buy $10k worth of QQQ and TQQQ on date X, sell on date Y.  On what 2 dates do you make more profit on QQQ than on TQQQ?  How likely is this scenario? How often does it actually occur?
Besides, leveraged ETFs are for losers. Real men trade futures.

Futures...no interest or margin fees.  Can also use an ETF for 3x.  Take a look at TQQQ performance over the past 10 years.  That is only 3x leverage yet it has returned almost 4,000%.   [

I'd saying buying the Dow with 10x leverage is less risky than buying BTC

Doesn't make as much difference as you seem to think it does.  Conduct some actual tests. Futures are optimal.
