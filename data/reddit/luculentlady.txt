A nice thing would be for Google to incorporate their AdSense with BitCoin payouts.

Three years ago I bought 2 bitcoin just for kicks when they were below $10...I was SO upset because the PC that had my wallet was long gone and I was looking through my external HD and finally I remembered that I backed it up on a thumb drive!
Long story short, keep an encrypted backup on a thumb drive that you backup regularly!
I sold one and when the money finally came in I paid off a small student loan....now I have to worry about taxes :D

I suppose the ultimate question is: Can we get really high level security on Bitcoin transactions and exchanges and how much of our anonymity would we be giving up for that?

Congrats! That's very exciting! 
I don't know if I would try scorpion-anything though :/

I just bought a quilt for my son using BTC and donated, made me smile when I saw that last page.

I don't know if I'm evil for just wanting them to never have a seat on the board again until they have better ethics.

I donate regularly to a couple of charities and I tell you now that if they started accepting Bitcoin I would definitely donate more than I do in dollars.

Apple is the biggest one I've been waiting so anxiously for.

Doesn't sound like he's starting this with the right mindset when he says, "..I'd love to **have** such a network.." and like you said, I wouldn't mine simply because I get the impression this isn't being very forthcoming.

Start by doing a little research. Look up [Bitcoin]( on Wikipedia and other tutorials.  Get yourself a safe wallet application that works on your operating system. Make sure you encrypt it and make a backup of it on a thumb drive or external hard drive that you don't connect to the internet often, encrypt that too! Read more about [secure wallets](
Get an account with an exchange like BitInstant or BitFloor or [others](
Also, read about how this should be handled with your taxes if you end up handling large sums of money as income.

I would check it with a higher frequency.

Thank you, this is fantastic.

It took me four months.

Yes, when I tried explaining it to an elderly coworker she freaked out and said that this is a sign that the world is ending...universal currency...
