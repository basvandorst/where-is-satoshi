A private bittorrent tracker and seedbox would probably be the most efficient method, but you'd have to put a bit of work in as well.
On the site side of things, users would purchase access to your torrents using bitcoins and the torrent infohash would be added to their account. They'd be able to download the torrent any time, any place, which you would be sedding from your seedbox.
It's an extremely cost efficient method of distribution. In the long run, you should look to put something like this together.
@_date: 2011-06-07 01:23:05
The free-market idea is flawed though as the distribution of money isn't equal. If people vote with their money, then those with the most money have the most power. That's not direct democracy at all and lead to greater corporate influence than what we see now.
Under a direct democracy, what you'd likely see is the immediate aquisition of all essential infrastructure. Energy, water, communications, etc. These companies could be run just as they are now or the board could be controlled directly by the public. The main difference being that the profits would be used for the benefit of the entire public instead of the benefit of a few rich people.
Direct democracy does not do away with goverments, social programs and regulations, it will exapnd them greatly for the benefit of society at the expense of a few tycoons.

Some reasons why AMD are going to see huge success over the next year and a half:
* Llano is releaed this month
* Bulldozer will be released in a couple of months.
* HD 7000 will be released by the end of the year.
* 28nm Quad-core Bobcat APUs early next year
* 8 core Bulldozer APUs by the end of 2012.
If I could buy stock in AMD, I most certainly would, as they're going to completely dominate the netbook and laptop market with Zacate and Llano this christmas.

The article says no such thing. It says that the 7670, 7850 and 7870 will be using VLIW4 and the 7950 and 7970 will be using GCN.
The 7870 is for all intents and purposes, an overclocked (from 880 to 950 MHz) 6970 that consumes half the power.
We know knothing about how the new GCN architecture that might be used in the 7950 and 7970 will perform as miners.

Well, as a gamer, the hardware costs are irrelevant. As a part-time miner, the electricity costs are not going to be much more either. As long as mining makes more than those increased electricity costs, I'll make a profit.

Yes, I agree. So why should the heir of some dynasty who has contributed nothing, reap the benefits of a long dead ancestors ingenuity?


Exactly. So why should that ability be controlled by a few people who happened to be lucky enough to be born into a wealthy family? If you give that ability to everyone, then everyone will prosper.


That's nonsense. If the productive ability was in the hands of the public, then value of money would be backed by the public instead of a few tycoons.


As long as you have the money to do so and if you don't, well tough shit, that's your own fault for being poor?


We can't though because we don't own any lands or have any funds. We're wage slaves who work in order to barely survive. We have no savings and no prospects of savings. We exist to generate wealth for others. Some of us aren't even that lucky and will have to turn to a life of crime in order to survive. Perhaps we should get together and take some lands by force? After all, that's how the dynasties aquired their theirs.


It may seem like that's what your asking for at first glance, but once you take into account that such a system wold start off heavily in favour of those already rich, and therefore be controlled by those who are already rich, the obvious conclusion is that you're not going to get what you bargained for.


Force is necessary for a such a system to work. Like I said, in order to implement a workable free market right now, you would have to strip everyone of their wealth, otherwise the wealthly would be in control. If the wealthy were in control, even more so than they are now, then they would use force to keep themselves in control, as they do currently. That's why this ideology is fascist.


It's not so simple when you take into account things that are essential for survival. In those cases, it can be a case of taking what's on offer or death. How is having such things controlled by a few rich people not fascist.


The problem with that though is that if the US fails economically, then the rest of the world is going to get fucked over too. If that's going to happen, I'd rather it be for something worth it like direct democracy that would actually benefit society.

@_date: 2011-06-07 02:24:07


We don't have a real free market. We do have plenty of people who were born into their wealth and have done nothing to deserve it though. So, if we were to implement a real free market system where money directly equals power, then such people would have more power than someone who has been working their arse off for the past 40 years. How is that fair?
That's what you guys fail to address. In order to make the 'free market' a reality, you'd have to strip everyone of their wealth, otherwise it would simply be controlled by those who currently have the most money, not those who have made the greatest contribution to society. That's the current dynasties of the economic elite, the corporate tycoons.
You're proposing fascism wrapped up in the flag of economic freedom.


I never said or implied that they need to be harmed or restrained. The difference between the rich and the poor is simply too great and these people have so much personal wealth that they wouldn't even notice if you took 90% of it. It would make no difference to their lives.
It simply makes more sense if that wealth was in the hands of the public helping to pay for social services, invest in future technologies, or anything else the public decided to do with it.

I'm saying that if you buy a GPU now for mining (a 5000 or 6000 series) then in six months, no one is going to want to buy one. Why? Because these cards are based on 40nm GPUs whereas the new HD 7000 series that will be out by then, will be based on a 28nm GPU. It will offer more performance, use less power and be cheaper to produce. It'll be like the jump from the 55nm 4000 series to the 40nm 5000 series.
Is there any demand for 4000 series cards at the moment?

I give someone numbers and letters, they give me shiny new stuff. Meanwhile, you're sitting there crying about how stupid I am for getting all my new shiny hardware for fuck all.


Of couse it is, unless you are suggesting that the banks are not in control of their own transactions. Is that what you're saying?

Let's look at both models.
In the voluntary situation, what happens when one person decides not to pay? That person was only paying a tiny fraction, in this case, 1/10000000 of the tax. Would such a reduction in the tax have a noticible effect? I doubt it. Now, other people start to think, "If he's not paying then neither am I". More and more people stop paying as they "don't see why we should pay for other people." Pretty soon the road system falls apart due to lack of maintenance and civilisation starts to break down.
In the 'forced' case, everyone who has been deemed to be able to afford the tax, has to pay it. The roads are maintained to an adequate degree and life goes on as normal.
There's a lot of mismangement and corporate influence in government affairs which needs to be tackled, that's for sure. Getting rid of lobbying and revolving doors would be a good start.

That's not certain at all. The closest card to the 5830 from the leaked specs is the 7850 which is pretty much an overclocked 6950 that consumes 90W. The 5830 consumes around 120W. The 7850 will definitely mine bitcoins at a greater Mh/$ ratio than the 5830, so it just depends on the launch price.

So create another group of people to do that job instead. Call them the Road Tax Collectors Association.
Let's do this for every function of the government. We now have hundereds of associations providing specific functions. Now there are too many to keep track of and we need to create another group specifically to keep track of all these associations and 'govern' them.
We end up with the same model of central government only this time, it's in the hands of 'associations', rather than 'depratments'.

Combining that with bitcoins seems like an interesting idea.

I've no idea how to send a SEPA payment and I've no idea who your UK bank is as there's no mention of it on the site.
How long does it take for a SEPA transaction to complete? UK bank to bank transfers take a few hours using Faster Payments and I know that transfers between HSBC current accounts are instant.
As a miner, I'm not really bothered about deposits. When I hit the withdraw button, I just want to enter my bank details and have the money deposited in my HSBC account instantly without any bank fees. That would be the ideal solution for me, so as close as you can get to that the better.
Who's your UK bank?

ASICS provide better efficiency but a GPU will kick the shit out of them in terms of Mh/s.
The 28nm HD 7000 series is only a few months away now. To see what type of performance gains we should expect, compare the hashrates of the 55nm 4000 series to those of the 40nm 5000 series.
Basically, ASICS are too expensive and too slow. You'd need about 10 of them to get a similar hash rate to a single 6990 and that would cost you at least 5x more upfront.
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:30:53
The media exposure isn't influencing the general curve though. It tends to be what's causing the spikes. The curve says that the price should be at around $17-$19. It's currently at $19.62. You can call that high all you want, but I'm calling it average.

I've put this card through its paces and 332 Mh/s was the best I could get from it while keeping it stable. I've been overclocking for about 10 years now so I know what I'm doing as well.
What settings are you using?
There's not a chance you're getting that type of hash rate from a 6870. You're likely getting that info from one of your pools and their stats are unreliable, I've had mine reporting over 400 Mh/s. Also, if you're running multiple instances of a miner on the same GPU and start them at different times, the overall hash rate will be totally off at first. You need to give it a couple of minutes for the miners to equalise their hash rates.
@_date: 2011-06-13 19:32:53


Then most of you don't understand what's happening. The price of bitcoins has been steadily rising and will continue to do so. According to the slope on the Bitcoin charts for MtGox, 1 BTC should be worth about $16-17 at the moment. Next week, the price should be around $25-30 and will probably fluctuate between around $20-$40.
Even if you buy at $30 now, next month BTC will be worth more.

I currently use Britcoin (Intersango) and the money gets transferred straight from their bank to my bank. What's the point of using AurumXchange? It just seems like an extra step to me without any benefits. Oh yeah, and Britcoin don't charge any fees.
To put it bluntly, being situated in the UK, I'd have to be an idiot to use MtGox rather than Britcoin unless you can bring a more competive offer to the table or at least match them.
Also, Intersango now have US and EU exchanges as well but I'm not sure if they work the same way.

No, that is not what I'm asking at all. I'm asking if the client has any code to allow it to be controlled remotely. Given that there exists a Bitcoin deamon, I don't believe the client contains such code.
@_date: 2011-06-14 21:06:27


That's not quite true. Here's what I found during my experimentation will the memory clock.
Above around 300 MHz it didn't have much of an effect on hash rate. Dropping the clock lower caused the hash rate to decrease slightly until around 260 MHz, at which point the hash rate started to increase again. The hash rate was at its maximum at 228 MHz, then started to slightly decrease again at the same rate from 228 to 260. This slight decrease occurred until the clock was at about 180 MHz, and below this value, the hash rate decreased rapidly.
So, the sweetspot for my GPU's memory clock is between 180MHz and 260 Mhz, with 228 giving me the best hash rate (by a couple of Mh/s).
@_date: 2011-06-06 10:33:08
That wouln't work out very well for you in the UK.
@_date: 2011-06-12 14:06:16
I think you'll need a higher wattage PSU. The one listed will run one of the GPUs but I wouldn't count on it to run both. You also need to take into account the number of power connectors on the GPU.
The 5830s that I've seen require 2 6-pin PCIE connectors, so to power 2 of them, you'll need a PSU with 4 6-pin PCIE connectors. Unfortunately, the PSU you listed only comes with 2 6-pin PCIE connectors. You can get adaptors that convert 2 4-pin molex connectors to a PCIE one though and you can probably get extra PSU cables (since it's modular). But like I said though, it's probably not going to be powerful enough to run both GPUs anyway.
@_date: 2011-06-05 15:13:09
Oh but it did though. It wasn't the actual amount of coins that caused it though, it was the circumstances surrounding the sale.

If you can pull up the records for that sale and those immediately before and after, you'll see that it happened exactly like I said it did.

As you can see from the bar chart above, the temp for the HD 6970 at load is 83 C and the temp for the HD 6970 CF (that's 2 HD 6970s in crossfire mode) at load is 91 C. The HD 6990 is basically 2 HD 6970s on one card. The temp should be somewhere in between those 2 values and the card should be able to handle a temp of 91 C. [These guys were running at 93 C]( The actual limits are over 100 C, but I'd definitely keep it below 95 C and try to keep it below 90 C.

I have. It was back in December though, on my 5 year old AMD Athon 64 X2 4400+ with a hashrate of 1.8 Mh/s running for less than 24 hours.
Then I forgot about it until all the articles a few weeks ago.

Which requires an account to access. You should update [this page]( wih the relevant information.


I should receive payment within 2 hours to 5 days after MtGox sends it then, depending on whether Faster Payments are used.


Britcoin were in the same situation last time I used them.


That's good news (for me anyway). Britcoin have just recently switched to HSBC as well. So, it boils down to whoever can implement automatic payments. I'm hoping it's Intersango. They're open source, so their solution would benefit everyone.
This now sounds like a worthy contender to Britcoin, so I'll keep an eye on it.
