Hey man.  I am an audio engineer and I would love to help.  From on location to Foley to post.   I need a bitcoin job, I work at a studio and I feel like I could contribute.

Gracias!  I will definitely go there.

I can help with more than just reception.   I have experience managing and with bitcoin.  And I am an audio engineer so I am handy with a soldering iron.

This just made me open a wallet for myself.  I am about to just buy from coinbase but I am wondering should I?  Also, how do I tip people via comments?  Thanks and I apologize if this has been said a million times.

I just got my coinbase 3/4 verified and I have to say I like it better than other online wallets as far as ease of use and design (ooooh colors)

Thank you for the heads up, what a shitty bank.
