I thought it was interesting that his take on what's stopping people from using bitcoin is its "insecurity".  Bitcoin is encrypted.... of course its secure.  If he means volatility, then yes, bitcoin is insecure in the sense that it's unstable, but no, it isn't "insecure" because it's so easy to hack.

No, she doesn't have a point.  She is floundering around for a point trying to justify her stupid decisions.  First she wanted to be feminist who advocated for sex workers' rights; then she wanted to be an anti-bullying spokesperson; now she's trying her hand at being the poster child for education costs spiraling out of control.  
It's not about 'getting fucked in the ass' now or later on the Dept of Education's terms.  Let's be honest, if you're taking out 200k in student loans, the majority of that money is coming from private loan companies, NOT the Department of Education.
If you want to talk about the rising costs of education in the US, the real question is whether or not it makes sense for everyone to get a college degree if it's going to cost you 200k+.  Yes, you could do porn to finance your eduction, but you could also donate eggs if you're a woman, rob a bank, sell drugs, or strip.  There's LOTS of different ways a young person can make that kind of money, but they all have their pros and cons.  Her decision to do porn to finance her education is just that -- her decision.  However, she's doing girls a disservice by getting up on a national platform and telling them that was a great career choice on her part and she has no regrets.

I can attest to this.  I spent 9th grade in a Catholic high school where I racked up a bunch of detentions.  Since I knew I wouldn't be returning to that school for the following year, I never bothered serving the detentions.  The school threatened that they would put that on my permanent record and it would look bad on my transcript for college.  Guess what?  I never had to send in a transcript from my Catholic school for my college admissions applications, and I still got into a first tier (but not ivy league) school.  Suck it, Sister Anne!

Bitcoin IS anonymous if you know how to use it properly.  No, it's not anonymous if you use the same wallet for all your transactions, but if you set up a new address for every transaction it's difficult (because nothing is impossible) to tie it back to an individual.  Every encryption method can be broken if you give it enough time.

I don't think it works like that.  Each time you send bitcoin to a wallet that's a unique transaction.  If you send $1 to 100 friends, that's still 100 transactions, regardless of what quickcoin does on their end.  You know that fee is the miners' transaction fee, right?

You're 100% right about that.  If you read Satoshi's white paper he says that you're supposed to create a new address for every transaction to maintain privacy/security.  Quickcoin is definitely not for the technologically savvy crypto-enthusiast, but you have to realize that most of the population isn't on that level.  
It comes down to what bitcoin means to you.  Even if it's totally traceable, it's still decentralized.  While your government may create regulations about how you can use bitcoin, ultimately, no individual or institution can control the Bitcoin network.  So yes, it opposes the basic principles of privacy, but you can still create fake facebook accounts.

Ben, we can't let you do that because we've signed contracts with our auditing firm form them to be confidential and then we'd have to sign new contracts permitting them to disclose those numbers to you and the whoooooole thing would be a huge headache.'

Long time lurker first time poster here.  Asking for proof that Moolah.io is a legit company is valid request.  It seemed a little fishy to me that they're trying to raise 50k for this homeless charity when they donated how much to dogecar?  Why do they have money for tipping and dogecars but not money for a homeless charity?  That seems like a Ponzi scheme to me.  
Speculating on this shit is obviously pointless.  This is an opportunity for someone at Moolah to either step up and respond or to ignore this request.  How they react will be telling.  Either they'll assuage these concerns or exacerbate them. 
The OP does give reasons why they're concerned: lots of money being spent; no where near the income to support the spending; a nebulous founder; and an address associated with scammers.  
I see a couple of posts trying to turn the table on the OP and ask for his/her identity, and this seems highly suspect to me.  The OP's identity isn't the issue.  The only issue is the questions s/he raises.

Weird.  You need checks for the security deposit on an apartment.

Porn can be safe but the kind of porn she was engaging in is degrading to women, particularly the actresses.  From their website:
Bianca Sage is as stupid as she is ugly. I'm assuming we found this troll eating billy goats underneath a bridge. Honestly, we should have left her there. She delivered the type of performance that someone of her caliber would expect. Seriously, she doesn't care about her appearance, why would she care about the quality of a porn scene? Part of me wanted to drop the camera so I can claim "tech failure" and not shoot her, but then the optimist in me is hoping that there's a niche for "ugly". If so, we fucking nailed it!

Unfortunately, we don't get to pick and choose where taxes go.  When they collect taxes, the first place that money is going is military spending.  I'm also willing to pay taxes for things I use and believe in, like roads, but I think military spending is the last place the government would trim the fat.
Back to the initial question, *how can a government govern bitcoin?*  I'm aware of how you can track bitcoins, but like you said, if someone is using Dark Wallet or Tor, it becomes more unlikely you'll be able to track it.  If a government really wanted to regulate bitcoin they'd have to dedicate resources to tracking the movement of all bitcoins, and as they become more widely accepted it's going to get exponentially more difficult for them.  Not to mention all the dead ends they're going to come up with tracking bitcoins to areas outside of their jurisdiction.  I imagine it's too difficult to track all the transactions in the block chain, but my technical understanding is limited.

It's a catch-22: the people who need it the most are the least inclined to understand it.  The thing is, they don't need to know what's under the hood -- they just need to know it's an option and they can use it.  
You don't have to understand something to use it.  Just look at cars, the internet, or even the human body.  Children have very little understanding of the human body but somehow they still mange to take care of all their needs and grow with it.

Clearly, people who are attracted to women are going to be interested in her.  I didn't say people who are attracted to her don't know about bitcoin.

Are you serious?  Is everyone out of their minds today?  Net neutrality is relevant to bitcoin because it's about censorship of the Internet.  If net neutrality dies, that sets the precedence for censoring the Bitcoin network/extorting the network for more money in order to allow Bitcoin  to continue functioning on the internet.  If you have millions of dollars invested in bitcoin, how much would it be worth to you to be able to continue having access to your investment?  A few hundred thousand dollars?  Maybe a few million dollars?  That's extortion, plane and simple.

The Nascar thing makes sense because for $50,000 dogecoin got to have their mascot seen on tv for a couple of hours.

I've read the article a couple of times... Ok, well skimmed?  My attention span is shot these days.... Or maybe it's the article?  Can I blame the author for my short attention span?  Anyway, I'm not totally sure I understood the article.
There's a lot of talk about the black market dollar trade in Argentina, and then there's a break down of how many vendors accept bitcoin per million residents. 
I believe the connection that was being made between bitcoin and the argentine peso is that argentines are willing to pay 20-30% more for the USD on the black market.  As such, the market is ripe for bitcoin.

Not everyone has the same opportunities in life.  For some people, working at Target is a good job.  For others, working at Target would be worse than a death sentence.  
It's entirely plausible that a woman might enjoy the attention from fat/old/ugly men.  It's more likely that they just tolerate it though to get a paycheck.  Look at V. Stiviano.  Do you honestly think she enjoyed looking at Sterling's wrinkly ball sack?  I can 100% guarantee you she didn't like that, but she put up with it because the reward ($2.5 mil in cash and prizes!) was worth it to her.  
I don't want to send the message that women can be bought and sold for men's sexual gratification/ viewing pleasure.  There's nothing I hate more than an ugly old man who thinks that just because he's got a little bit of money in his pocket he can buy me.
Again, no one is vilifying sex.
I just know I personally don't like unattractive men looking at me lustily.  I can't imagine other women enjoy it, either, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and say it's possible some of them do because if there's one thing the internet taught me, it's that there's something for *everyone*.  
I hate the idea of a scantily clad woman being paid for fucking losers to stare at and get semi-erections off of.  I think it's lame, and it's not contributing to the advancement of women or bitcoin.

Having spent a lot of time in Latin America, it's hard for me to think of this as "the black market".  To me, it was just common sense that you'd change your money on the streets as opposed to in a bank because you get better exchange rate.  
Now that I don't travel there as often, I wouldn't go change money on the streets because it's a little over my head.  (Read: I'd be an easy mark to pass counterfeit bills off to.  Side note: You state that Argentina doesn't have a problem with counterfeit bills.  I wonder if it's because the inflation is so bad it's literally not worth the paper it's printed on, even if its counterfeit.  In Peru it's a rampant problem -- I've received a few counterfeit bills myself.)
Just to be clear, you're saying you haven't seen an adoption of bitcoin in the 'black market' *yet*?  To clarify, this article is based on your own observations as you are in Argentina or are you using other sources?  I didn't see what your sources were for this article.  
You mention more businesses adapting bitcoin per million compared to NYC -- do you have examples of what kinds of businesses are accepting bitcoin?  If you're in Argentina, it'd be really cool to take a few pictures of businesses that accept bitcoin in Buenos Aires.
It might also be cool to explore how bitcoin impacts real estate purchases in Argentina.  I saw an episode of International House Hunters where an American couple was purchasing real estate in Argentina, and they were very uncomfortable carrying that much cash with them.  It also presented a logistics problem since you can't enter/leave a country with that much cash on you.  I'd be interested to know if anyone has purchased property in btc in Argentina yet.
Are there any bitcoin meetups there?

A third party confirming that these events are true.  Like a real journalist, or several different people who can verify that this is a real person who has a real medical condition.  So far I've just seen the 3 girls in the video.  I haven't seen anyone else corroborating their story.  I do have to specify that I'd need to see unbiased 3rd parties corroborating the story, like a teach from the high school, or random adults who know Peyton IRL.

According to the rules of message board soliciting for money is prohibited.  It doesn't matter if you're soliciting on someone else's behalf or if you're soliciting for yourself.  
The point of that rule isn't to be mean but to prevent the forums from being flooded by requests for money by individuals.  If everyone going through a hard time was given an audience in for soliciting the board would be overrun with solicitations.  I'm sure there's some other subreddit that's better suited to asking for money, be it in cryptocurrency or otherwise.  
I don't think you're collecting funds for yourself.  I think you're collecting funds for someone else's bitcoin wallet.

Here's the problem: How do you ban bitcoin?  It's decentralized and it's up to individuals whether they want to accept it or not as payment.  Yes, you can "ban" bitcoin but if I'm really intent on having bitcoin, I can store it on a hard drive, in a brain wallet, or on a piece of paper, and there's no way the government will ever find it.  It'd be like trying to find a needle in a haystack... only that haystack is the entire world.

What a load of horse shit!  Can they select 0% interest?  No?  Oh, wait, you're telling me that the debtors set the interest price and the borrowers get to pick the best one available to them.  That's not really the same as selecting their own interest rate, is it?  
It's like saying someone in the developed world can select their 'own' interest rate on loans.  Yes, they can select one out of the options that they're given, but no, they don't set their own interest rates.  
The idea of making a profit off of people who are already dirt poor is DISGUSTING.  It makes me want to vomit how disingenuous microfinance is.  "Saving the world, one loan at a time!" -- but they forget to mention that people in the developing world are paying on average something like 120% APR while the MFI, Compartamos, had $154.2 million (USD) in net income in 2012.

No, the OP is implying that this is a government smear campaign against bitcoin.  The US government has this handy tool in their back pocket called "terrorism" and anytime they don't like what you're doing they label you a "terrorist" and all of a sudden they get to do whatever they want.  For example, you're an Occupy Wall Street protestor, or a Free Palestine protestor -- all the American government has to do is say they suspect you of terrorism and all your constitutional rights go out the window because you're now a terrorism suspect.

Just do a search on reddit for coinbase and you'll see several people with this very complaint.  There was a guy who was trying to buy 10k+ in December and his transaction was delayed for weeks.  Although he made the purchase order at $X, by the time the order was processed, bitcoins were selling for $X + 10 percent (or whatever) and so Coinbase tried to give him coins at the rate of x + 10% instead of the rate he placed his purchase order which was x.  After the user put coinbase on blast, their customer service agreed to make the purchase for him at his initial rate, but only because it was hurting their image.

I wouldn't say the state will never be able to control bitcoin.  I mean, they're already busy killing net neutrality, so it'd be simple enough for them to block bitcoin in the future.  Also, while they won't be able to control bitcoin on the individual level they can stifle the corporate level.  And maybe that's a good thing.  Bitcoin exists as an alternative to the current financial system that's overrun with douchebags.  Maybe commercializing bitcoin just puts us back at square 1.

100% verifiable truth: Brock Pierce is named as a co-defendant in the lawsuit against Bryan Singer.
Regardless of whether there's merit to the suit or not, being associated with the Bryan Singer suit alone is detrimental to the lawsuit.
Members of the bitcoin community voicing their concern over Brock Pierce's role in the suit is reasonable and smart.  
Technically, Charlie Shrem hasn't been found guilty of money laundering, and yet he's still no longer on the Board to avoid is bad pressing sullying the Foundation.  To let anyone steeped in any controversy be a member of the Board is unwise.
Like I said, there's more going on with Brock Pierce than some yellow journalism.  Also, there's a world of difference between "Hey this guy is Satoshi!" and "Hey this guy is part of a sex ring that drugs and rapes minors!"  You can't be too careful in distancing yourself from the latter.  Even if there's only a miniscule chance that the allegations are true, the allegations are so grave that you have to maintain your distance from anyone associated with them because in the event that they're true, they're abysmal.

What is "our demographic"?  Our demographic is everyone.  We should be sponsoring music, art, dance, science, corn dogs, nascar, deodorant, condoms, monster trucks, etc.  Having an elitist attitude and a belief that bitcoin is 'high brow' is alienating.

Putin is pushing back on Visa and Mastercard.  It has nothing to do with funding his army.  It's about the US imposing sanctions on Russia and freezing their assets, and Russia pushing back on these credit card companies.  Visa and Mastercard are feeling the squeeze from both ends.

It's an interesting dilemma.  I'm sure most scientists aren't in it for the money, but they still need to eat just like everyone else.  They're not in a position to dictate the terms of how their research is used.  I see your point, though, about how it's counter-intuitive to donate to the process of finding a cure that will be sold to the highest bidders.

We already know what a bitcoin is because we're asking about how to hit on bitcoin models in I'm assuming people who get paid to model don't give a fuck about the product and are just there to model it.  I'm also assuming that a woman who's intelligent enough to know and understand bitcoin would have better employment options available to her than standing around being ogled by men. (sorry for being heteronormative here but men are the biggest perps of ogling.)

"It's a bug" is what you say when you get caught with your pants down to cover your ass.  Coinbase clearly fucked up, as usual, and tried to jump on this pr bomb by saying it's a bug.  Mark Karpeles used the similar "I was hacked" line.  Blaming it technology/security is the classic way to diffuse responsibility.

That one woman who got the check wins.  All the other women who didn't get checks do not win because the idea that looks are all that matters is reinforced.  Also, it's possible the chick with the check doesn't win, either, because she just had to put up with some bullshit for not enough money.

So your proof that coinbase is making good on their offer to give $10 to people who sign up with a .edu is that they said they're doing it on their blog?  Great!  Problem solved! 
Doesn't work with SFSU,  or  according to the comments, plus a few other undisclosed universities.  Not working with SFSU is shameful when it's in the same city as CB's headquarters.

He's fat -- he's a glutton.  It speaks to our cultural ideas about sin and inherent evil.  He stole money; he stole the food out of people's mouths.  
I understand your concern about fat-shaming, but I don't agree with it.  Once you start to get more than 50 pounds overweight, it is a fucking insult.  It's an insult to people in developing countries who are starving, and it's an insult to people with physical disabilities who don't have the privilege of having a fully functioning body.  
As a culture, Americans have gotten too accepting of fat.  Everyone's talking about how the average women's dress size is a 12 and how unfair it is that most mannequins are a size 2.  Maybe it's time to get off your ass and exercise.

I agree.  In the other thread people started about this app, they're bashing coinbase about getting into bed with an unknown player.  No one is paying attention to the fact that one of the co-founders used to work at AirBNB and is most likely good friends with this developer from their work connection.  I'm not worried about the developer running off with my bitcoins, but I agree that it's a sloppy move on coinbase's part.  Whoever is running their PR over there is asleep at the wheel.  Coinbase has one flop after another.  Pathetic.

You absolutely can buy groceries with them.  Although grocery stores themselves do not accept bitcoin, Gyft does.  You could take your bitcoins and use them to buy gift cards to Whole Foods.  Gyft has an extensive list of gift cards they sell.  You can get Whole Foods, Sears, CVS, Home Depot, Applebee's, Burger King, Legal Seafood's, Maggiano's, Staples, and the list goes on.  There's nothing you could buy that you couldn't do through Gyft.  
You're right in that using Gyft would be much more difficult anywhere outside of America.  You're also right in that paying individuals with bitcoin would be much more difficult.  Not just for rent, but for services rendered, such as doctors, lawyers, mechanics, etc.  However, you might be surprised at who would accept bitcoin if you asked.  There are doctors here in the US who are accepting bitcoin.  You could also potentially barter with them -- gift cards to the stores of their choosing.  If someone has to accept $1000 from you in gift cards from The Gap, or something similar, they might charge you say an extra 10% for the inconvenience in getting paid in gift cards, but I'm sure you could find someone who is willing to take the gift cards in exchange for an extra 10%.

I want to say you're wrong but I can't find a flaw in your logic.  Since he's banned from bank accounts, he would have to use localbitcoins to find someone to trade with.  Either he'd have to meet them in person, deposit money into their checking account, or buy prepaid cards in order to buy in to bitcoin.  In either scenario, he's still running around converting fiat into electronic money.  
The only way bitcoin could save him time/money is if he got paid in bitcoin by his employer.
@_date: 2014-06-03 02:50:23
I agree to a certain extent.  In both the cash buried under a tree and bitcoin scenario there would be a large cash withdrawal from the bank and then the money would disappear.  However, it's much easier to hide a bitcoin than it is a duffle bag full of cash, which is where bitcoin would excel in hiding assets from a spouse.
