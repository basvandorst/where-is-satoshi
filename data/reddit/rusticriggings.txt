Oh ya, I must be googling this too... AMIRITE? How does it feel to get slayed in public? Now like I said.. Sit down, the adults are talking.

which is odd because we do actually have CRKT for sure.  Meh, out with with the old and in with the new!  Working on a bug with zencart now, but i should have something going soon.

we have A LOT of name brands, and I'm working to improve what we have.  I'm from Vermont and an avid mushroom hunter, hiker, camper, fisher, outdoors men myself so I know what you mean when it comes to being picky. 
We're working on bringing in North Face, Patagonia, and others as well, it's just not as easy as some :)  We use more than one supplier at the moment.  
You have some really good ideas!

maybe i'll look into adding google checkout or stripe or something, but paypal couldn't pay me enough to use their service.  To many bad experiences.  What type of goods are you selling on your e-commerce site?
Seems to be the general consensus is to accept other currencies so i'll really contemplate that on my flight home from Cleveland today.

This has been completely resolved and we now support Canadian shipping

I got your e-mail!  I'm super busy at the moment with just my website.  Can I do a feed of my inventory to coingig?  Do you have that capability?
@_date: 2013-09-11 18:17:33
thanks a lot!  We're rebuilding our site now thanks to all of these recommendations.  We're working on getting it up as I type this.
@_date: 2013-09-19 10:34:26
Glad you enjoy it!  I worked hard to make it nice this time, instead of just throwing something together :)  Still more work to be done!

RusticRiggings.com is new and we sell outdoor, camping, hiking, survival, tactical gear, knives, and more for nothing but bitcoin!  
I think these types of stores need to be supported if we want to see widespread mass adoption of bitcoin.  Vendors can provide better prices by only offering bitcoin.  In exchange we should support those business to help kickstart the closed loop economy

Ahh I see the category list is getting truncated, to many sub cats, thanks will fix :)

We've been doing these give aways on the bitcointalk forums, and I figured I would bring it to reddit too!
The next person to spend 1BTC+ in our store, will receive a $25 Gift Certificate.

You did and I'm grateful!  You were our second customer!  So to say thanks here is a coupon code!  But it's good for the next 5 customers instead of just one :) code: reddit5for5    -    Good for 5% off your order.

But if no one uses them it's no longer useful.. It becomes a negative sum game training new cabbies to take bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-09-11 00:05:29
what little success we have had, all came from this avenue so far.  Just not enough success to keep the ads rolling.  Working on that(it gets expensive!).  We've done reddit ads, coinurl ads, and i'm working on bitcoin magazine, and a few more places to do some ads.  I did a /bitcoin post, those kinds of things. 
Reddit so far has been by far the best driver of traffic.  Both the /bitcoin post and the reddit self serve ad ended up with 1 sale each and even more unique visitors to the site.
@_date: 2013-09-06 13:45:00
This is the biggest issue bitcoin will face if it ever wants to become a means to conduct transactions.. No one wants to spend them.. 
I'm seein this in my bitcoin only business.  No one wants to spend their bitcoins except for mining hardware.  If these type of reports continue, people will be less likely to
Support bitcoin.. It's in everyone's beat interest to
Shop with bitcoin!  I stead of
Blowing on Sdice and seals spend it at alpaca socks, bees brothers, this cab company, rustic Riggings, or any other btc shop!

She didn't say, I just thanked them and explained to her that because if their generosity in that situation they got my business and she seemed really happy about it..  I guess it has taken a lot of effort to facilitate the bit floor issue
@_date: 2013-09-11 09:49:31
Thanks a lot!  I processed your order bright and early this morning.  That knife is awesome!  Please let us know what you think of our service and how we can improve.
@_date: 2013-08-29 20:47:30
I can ship to Canada, is my site not letting you place an order?  I will fix it!  Argh!  Edit: I'm working on this now.  Will post back when I'm done.

shamefully promoting my own site, I hope to service the bitcoin community with lots of great outdoor gear.  I have over 4500 products in my store so far, and will be adding a bunch of stuff from a few new vendors coming very soon!  I'm also looking to get some accounts with fishing, and other outdoor gear I do not currently ofer in the store.  
If you see an item you want, but don't like the price, feel free to contact me, I will always negotiate!  I can be contact at support through our live chat on the website, or here on reddit!
Hopefully I don't get down voted to much! Long live bitcoin!

@_date: 2013-08-28 11:59:45
That's correct I'm only accepting bitcoins!  It allows me to offer much cheaper prices than even amazon in some cases!  I cancelled my Paypal accounts awhile back due to being very unhappy with them and having them take money back after the customer received a product I sold on eBay.  I just love bitcoins and want to see it succeed!

@_date: 2013-12-21 13:08:43
actually it's not either.. Bitcoin is first and foremost a protocol.
@_date: 2013-09-11 10:03:22
To everyone that has responded, thanks so much.  As ruthless as the bitcoin community can be, I'm often floored at the response to assistance and other situations around the bitcoin community where your support is needed.  
I will work to put all of this stuff into action, and will let everyone know once we've made all the suggested changes.
@_date: 2013-09-11 12:01:13
well aren't you a douche..  no ones crying kid.. So let me get this straight, you spend time posting in /bitcoin a place for fans of bitcoins, yet think its a scam for get rich wannabes, got it.  Remind me never to take any business advice from you in the future.
@_date: 2013-08-28 23:12:10
We've made some updates to our site!  Hopefully makes it a little more enjoyable to browse.  
@_date: 2013-09-12 14:24:52
Hey Sean thanks a lot!  We're in the process of making the changes the community requested, and well go from there! 
If we can help out in anyway let me know!  Good luck with your projects as well!  What you're doing is great for humanity and a shining example in the community.
@_date: 2013-09-18 17:20:26
Absolutely thanks!

i was talking to one of the higher ups yesterday at IAFCU and she told me that they are experiencing a lot of repercutions from the bitfloor incident... I hope everyone supports them for all the work they've done! 
@_date: 2013-09-23 15:36:49
Until they solve the problem with requiring two block chains, and the memory issue I'd say moving away from that would be best..
I am not a top tier python dev, but I do know code and am a fast learner.. I'm at work but will get my dev environment up and running.. 
If I'm going to be involved I'd hope we would branch our own client ad not just rework something else..
@_date: 2013-09-10 23:54:45
great info!  I'm not looking to make a living wage at this time.  Breaking even would be nice, or a bit of profit to pour back into the business.  I have a day job, so right now it's a "hobby" that I take really seriously.  I'd love to earn a living wage, but it's not my end game.
I think the fact that bitcoin requires that level of trust in e-commerce will allow the best business to shine.  The ones that truly take care of their customers will be the ones to succeed..  All great points thanks so much!
@_date: 2013-08-31 13:01:39
there's always been a strong correlation of difficulty &gt; price, i think if it was just mtgox we wouldn't be seeing bitstamp following at a much more realistic value..  do I think gox's price is inflated? Yes, but i'm not sure how that explains the rally at all exchanges.  Are people buying because of the gox rally?  
@_date: 2013-09-10 22:47:53
The idea was, I could pass on all the savings of bitcoin to the customers.  The only way I can possibly offer the prices I do, is to only accept bitcoin.  Otherwise I have to deal with fraud, high processing fees, chargebacks months down the road, etc.
with bitcoin the only the I have to worry about is excellent customer service.  Which I think any of our few customers so far would say we do pretty well!
maybe I need to offer alternative currencies(even though I'm only really interseted in the crypto kind) and give discounts to bitcoiners.. but I loved the idea of bitcoin only.

Hey man, I have applied for access to the USPS International API Tools, i'm waiting for my access.  As soon as I receive it I can include international shipping.  In the mean time, if you want to tell me what item you want, I can give you the price and you can send it to me and I can place the order for you.  Otherwise I should have international shipping integrated within 24-48hrs, as soon as I get my credentials for the API Tools.
@_date: 2013-09-11 09:55:01
excellent information, and based on this thread I had kind of come to that some of these conclusions.. I also agree with you on 3dcart, I will be looking into a new cart software ASAP!  I'm not sure why I even went with a pay cart in the first place when I have an entire cloud.  I had a company offer to automate the inventory for me, and I had a list of carts to choose from.  I think I'll just automate the inventory myself now that I have a custom data feed from my warehouse and go from there.  Doing both of those things will bring the costs down quite a bit and make it feasible to stay bitcoin only :)  
the search is TERRIBLE, the navigation is terrible, and so on.  This is all amazing information that I will put into action and hopefully have something new up in the next couple weeks.
I will PM you when I get home from my flights about maybe assisting.
Also, the reason there is no address is because I run it out of my home, and don't feel really comfortable having my home address on display for the world on a website.  We have a phone # i'll add to the site, I believe it does show up on the receipts from bitpay?  Also, the LLC is registered in the state of Missouri.  Either way, none of those things are going to ease peoples fears and I'll fix this by getting a PO Box or something for correspondence.
Thanks so much for taking the time to put all this into words, it really is going to help me a lot! :)

there doesn't seem to be any major problems, at least she didn't let on that way.  I just assume she meant lots of work they weren't expecting, angry customers, or something.. Maybe I'm wrong about that I don't know, but I still opened an account, and I had nothing to do with bitfloor.  
I'm using them for my business rusticriggings.com because I've just seen way to many people dealing with BTC day to day have their accounts shut down and I can't afford to.  I didn't get the feeling they're going to all of a sudden start crackign down on BTC users, so..

that's really weird on the search, but i see what you mean.  If you type the word TENT in the search box, the preview search pops up tents near the search box, but if you submit it, you get no tents.. Thanks this is the kind of stuff I'm looking for :)
Thanks for all the good advice!
