People don´t mind fiat because of wealth concentration. 
But because of endless wealth concentration and confiscation by inflation. 
You have no power over your money in fiat. Someone else can just decided to print more.
With Bitcoin neither you or anyone else can magically create more. 
There will only be 21 million. 
Once someone spend them they are distributed. They have spent them.
If they do not spend them, fewer will have bitcoins and the value of bitcoins will not increase in the same way.

This is something the bitcoin foundation could manage.
Let people come up with 10 good slogans, let people vote 
(with bitcoins to avoid to much spam votes).
Than run the campaign as long as possible.

Nathan_Flomm. There are so many flaws in your example I do not know where to start.
Your example do not apply at all to Bitcoin. In your example. Everyone was given pudding and after a while because they had enough of it they did not want more. There were no demand. They were also given more of it every day.
"The problem here is that every student is given pudding snacks everyday."
What you are saying is because everyone had enough, no one wanted more. Than I guess you mean that if they had traded them, some would not had enough so there would be demand?
When you save something you send the signal that its worth something for you and when you refuse an offer you send the signal that you think its worth more than that offer.
Remember the guys at school who did not want to share whatever they had and everyone became jealous? That was because they were "hoarding" it.
Giving something away/spending it, do not create demand. 
Demand comes from completely other factors.
Demand is created because people like a product.

1. Give a discount for those who buy it using Bitcoins.
2. Make it available a little earlier for those who pay for it with bitcoins.
3. Name a song or something that hints on bitcoin. Names like: decentralized, gold 2.0, Nakamoto, Fin Haley, Sirius, Gavin or any of the early developers of Bitcoin.
4. Have bitcoin adresses as QR code in your video, webpage and or on the front or back of your record cover.

Tell them, that now days, bills are only a representation of the digital number in a database. 
Whenever this someone uses a bank, a creditcard, paypal its all 100% digital like bitcoin, except its kept in a closed, central database that a company owns.
If they do not believe in digital money, they should stop using the private banks digital money.
Bitcoin is a both decentralized and open database, that everyone owns, so that no one can in secret change anything in that database for their own good.
If they believe in cash. Bitcoin is closer to cash than any other digital money. Because there is noone in power who controls the database the money you send can not be moved back.

"Like paying hidden fees when you buy a product?"
Than don´t use bitcoin.

Which is not necessarily only bad for US as it would increase export. But its not going to happen over night. It will take atleast 20 years because the majority of people will not trust something with all their hard earned money, that has only existed for 5 years and governments will keep taking taxes in fiat.
Also when price rise people will always get afraid they have "missed the boat" and when price goes down, some get afraid it will go down more and simply leave and less people adopt.
In reality the fear that some banks and fiat payment systems have is a little unfounded.
In longterm, yes bitcoin and cryptocurrency is here to stay.
But it will be very long term 50-100 years for them to really take over it all if ever.

No deflation drives trade. Because those who sell things want money that deflates, they lower their prices thus increase the amount of goods traded. Nobody wants an inflating currency that drops in value, thus sellers raise their prices which causes sales to drop and economy to stagnate.

Debit/creditcard is not hard cash, its virtual digits, its soft money as it can be charged back, that is withdrawn up to 6 months after a purchase, something that creates problems for many online retailers. Since its abused.
A Bitcoin transaction can never be withdrawn once give away, thus its more like real cash. This is one of the unique properties of bitcoins. 
This also makes buying bitcoin with creditcards somewhat not compatible.
The fact that once they are sent they are gone also means that you have to be more careful about viruses and keyloggers, a problem which will be solved in the future with hardware wallets.
Like this one.
And other solutions.
Bitcoin is money and it makes it easy to know how much money you have compared to how much there will ever be. Try to know how much fiat currency you will have compared to how much there will be...
The price of bitcoin and the value of the Bitcoin network increase as more people use them, there are more places to spend them on, and more people want them. Its also up to its users what the value of bitcoins are, if people are willing to sell them cheap, than thats their value, if most people really think they are worth more than they are.

Bitcoin gives people freedom that they do not have in any other kind of currency. Some people will allways value freedom. Some people will never care.
Bitcoin makes micropayments possible. So even if you do not pay rent etc in Bitcoin it can be useful for other kinds of things like micropayments. 
Private payments for porn etc.
Remittance money.
You are probably right in that it will never replace the dollar. 
Some other kind of fiat will in a far future, however there are other markets for bitcoins to be very useful for many people round the world to keep some bits.

+ You need the space and electricity to run all those, and staff to handle them. Another $1 million? 
So total cost would be $49 million? 
To make a double spend.
