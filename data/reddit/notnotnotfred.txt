that may be the simple solution, bet the better solution would be to compare more characteristics of the check, and weight the characteristics in priority.

sorry, I don't follow your analogy.
With real world checks, there is every reason to reject checks that have been altered in certain ways (forgery, altered numbers)
The idea of tracing the unique check id makes perfect sense in the scenario of actual paper checks.
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:24:04
yes.  so while *these* busts happened in Florida, don't think the enforcement effort is only there.
Follow the law.  do the KYC thing, and if you have enough $ hire a lawyer to help you stay within the law.

thank you.  
SO Alex adds a stock share to his coin and sells it to Beverly.
How does Beverly separate the coin and the share of stock?
or if Bevery trades the coin/stock combo to Carl, who sells it to Dianne..and so on to Zoe, how can Zoe cash in on the stock, especially if she only owns some fraction of coin/stock combo?
using your stock illustration, I just see more confusion for the coin:

I don't believe this.   A bitcoin bank can assume ownership of all bitcoin deposits, issuing depositors deposit slips, (clearly explained in section 232b paragraph 97 line 87), and use the deposited bitcoin for reinvesting / loaning / tribble herding schemes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:19:53
confirmed.  other people have seen this and I have too, upon attempting to place an order.

Dollar cost averaging on an asset that did in fact appreciate does on average yield less return than making a bulk investment at the beginning.
Dollar cost averaging on an asset that did in fact depreciate does on average yield less loss than making a bulk investment at the beginning.
The question is why you'd invest in an asset that you expected to depreciate.  Your expectations may prove wrong.

Actually I think Ebay's reputaton system (or a similar system) is the best choice  for buyers.   Get someone to implement it for bitcoin transactions.

no, Ebay is not perfect.  But their reputation system is worth examining.

verify whether there is overcurrent protection.  if there is not, and you give it too many amps, you're bound to melt something.

You could lose all of your £10.
more problems could come if you want to add doomsday or government overreach scenarios:
your toaster could melt your jam.
Your could exhale rapidly.
You could ride an escalator that moves too rapidly.
The government could impound your bitcoin and / or arrest you for invented charges related to buying bitcoin.
Zombies could occupy the landing where you exit the escalator.

It's high risk investing, but he's young enough that he can recover if he loses it all.

but relative to btc, national currencies are pretty well caged.  Your corner grocery store isn't going to care much about the usd / yen conversion rate bc she doesn't have to.  Her distributor is a little closer to the international market, but is still well buffered from those fluctuations.  The Importer, on the other hand, knows where the money is to be made, and you  can bet he's watching the FOREX very closely.
otoh, if I'm purchasing online from another nation, I have to know that there is a  conversion rate (even if I barely understand it) and It may be worth my while to delay or accelerate my purchase if I think I forsee a tend.

ok, I'll give you one bitcoin in exchange for your 1.6 bitcoins.
In a month, when the 1 bitcoin I gave you is still worth less than the 1.6 bitcoin you gave me, you'll give me the bitcoin I gave you back.

You assume, wrongly, that  Joe and Lisa cannot alter strategies.  Lisa appears to have a competitive edge, unless Joe and Lisa live in different climates or have different energy policies &amp; rates that they must consider.  Joe's agreement with his landlord may include different utility rates. Joe may also need to use a different room than his basement.
