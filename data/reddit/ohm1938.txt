donation address would be nice..
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:41:39
hardware wallet (trezor or ledger) is a much more convenient choice.. for your friend ;)

confirmed now :)

yup,  donation worked fine..

bug, try making a direct channel to vendor, urls here: 
@_date: 2018-04-05 10:06:03
for some reason the remaining amount after creating channel must stay &gt;0.001 btc, so if you have for example 0.003 btc, you can open channel with 0.002 btc..

(for some reason they don't have it on their website)
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:23:31
same problem, opened a channel with ACINQ, not working with blockstream store (RemoteFailure)..weird
@_date: 2018-04-05 12:02:08
experimenting with values :)
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:15:24
afaik these spend-only nodes are hidden, they create private channels, no routing..so they will not show up on recksplorer
