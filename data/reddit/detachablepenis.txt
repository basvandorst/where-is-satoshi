Only paid $350 for what was 5 btc at the time. Turned that into 11 goxcoins. Not a big loss seeing it was only $350 of my money, but a loss nonetheless in btc.

Their support is friendly. I went into their irc and chatted with one of their main people. He was nice, and reinstated a buy order at the original price, which was $20-30 below the current market price. This was before any of their verification steps. Now I can buy immediately. Sadly, I only have .05btc. The rest were at you know who.

Seriously. Know what happened when I ran into a problem? Went directly into their irc channel and (I don't recall his name) their main support guy at the time helped me within 15 minutes after I opened a support ticket.

You bought 1BTC at $200. You want to buy something on sale for $200. Do you spend 1BTC on it? No, you now spend 0.172BTC.

Got myself some honey from bees brothers.

Honest question, is it at all reasonable to expect that it will get that high? Granted I thought $15 was as high as it would get, but is $10,000 reasonable?

From time to time you run into teachers who are idiots. This seems like one of them. Growing up, my brother did a science project on electromagnetism, and the teacher "knew" that it was too advanced for him so he must have cheated. Way to encourage bright minds.
