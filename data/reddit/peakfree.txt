I think its around 500 bit (basically the same you said: 20 per second and 25 sec but you came up with 250 bit?). Thats why I am having troubles finding the right decoding scheme. Could be anything but ascii...
Another strange thing: at the end there is a blank (silence) followed by 11.
And it sounds like it was recorded with a microphone (listen to the silent part at the beginning and the end).

I like this idea. It is even more transparent than what I was thinking about. And I guess many people in general are interested about what Bitcoin is and some of them would like to try it out with a few mBTC. 
 Thanks! My first approach will be to talk to people who are interested in Bitcoin and discuss the advantages and problems. It feels like there are many news articles about it, many people talk about it, but there is not enough *useful* information available besides this (in daily life I mean). I'd like to fill this gap.

Yeah, another good point, thanks for bringing that up!
Thanks for all the thoughts! I wanted it to be a small scale project: meet with few people (a bitcoin stand really sounds like it could be more trouble than useful) and take the time to show them the basic principles of bitcoin (in case they are interested, I'm used to explaining it to people since 2010 :D ). Then again the idea of a club / group sounds more useful.
Then maybe I should just put some money on Kraken and buy coins as needed. I just feel a little insecure having money deposited there.

Yeah you are right about 5% being peanuts. But it is still 5% in one direction and it is why I  still use conventional ATMs. I guess I am just frustrated that we are not yet "there". :D

Yeah, I know about who is setting fees and I understand that people want to make money. There is supply. But also demand? Who uses the atm's? Why?
