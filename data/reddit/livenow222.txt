Actualy did that more of profit taking it should run back up like when it dropped from .0160 down to .0080 and back up to .0280 dont be a hater. And whoever thumbs downed a good question needs to get a life. This is about money not your favorite cryptocurrency. Grow up.

Bitcoin will be in the 200s soon so think about your money just as much as the coin. I think youve guys been around together so long you feed each other gibberish causing you to lose money by hating on other coins. This post should not get thumbs downed unless your sore loser haters.
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:24:07
Im a crybaby I dont understand ripple so I thumbs down every Ripple post. I am what you call a Bitcoin nerd. I dont trade for investment but because I find a cryptocoin I like and hate on all others. Get a life losers your the ones that missed the move from .005 to .0280 could have made a lot if you werent such a crybaby.
Money speaks louder than your gibberish opinion. Which was wrong since you missed out.
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:53:08
Very true but this actually matters why when you are investing?
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:52:22
No im not its just I post a serious question and Bitcoin fangirls thumbs down. Im neutral person I dont act like I know everything about my investments. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:34:59
Being a hater doesnt make you money I can care less about things I dont know about but an investment is good if you make money. Seems it was a good choice for many thousands of people. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 06:07:48
What you close-minded bitcoiners don't understand is that money talks. It doesnt matter what it does as long as it can make you money. You could have already purchased 1 million at $0.0023 earlier this year and sell it right now for a 450% return.
So you are wasting your time acting like you have a degree in predicting the future and like you know 100% anything about Ripple. 
Keep playing the I know everything about Ripple game and soon you will look back and say why was I being a hater unnecessarily, if only my ego was smaller and I remained neutral and climbed out of the "I think I know everything box".

Everyone thinks they are Nostradamus on@_date: 2015-01-05 20:47:57
You think it's going back up? Possible 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:54:11
Karma for hating on other cryptocoins. Now those big heads have shrunk. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:45:29
Aren't you supposed to buy low and sell high? I think I did it backwards. Help
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:41:50
When do I stop holding the bag?
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:36:56
Thank you that's why I look at the pattern of slowly going from over 1000 to under 300
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:39:49
You should sell ASAP. This things losing it's steam 
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:32:09
Someone said they would be buying Vodka lol
@_date: 2014-12-19 15:21:32
I agree its being manipulated but that doesnt mean you can make a ton of money like I have already. Has anyone here bought in the 0.0050s?
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:14:18
True but still not acting like a leader right now more like a fight between middle school girlies plus the greed factor.
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:53:35
Shitcoiners lol good one well I asked a few questions about bitcoin personally and was downvoted for seeking knowledge so it's more than about other coins being promoted here. Its the man/woman atmosphere as you said a bunch of lady boys with their faces pointed up. 
Those who arent need to set them straight tell them Bitcoins reputation is more important. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:07:41
I expected that but its still worth posting because you guys need to do better for the entire cryptocurrency movement. Every bit of ignorance can get in the way of mass adoption because of tiny egos like yours.
This sub has bad vibes dude its because of people like you. Thus sub in reality should have 1 million + subscribers think about it. It's the leading cryptocurrency... either people unsubscribe or dont want to subscribe because of the bad vibes here. Do you guys want to be behind r/btc?
@_date: 2017-10-05 23:24:34
So they must not like you then huh...whiny bitches downvote and act like manginas. Downvoting is a feminine act.
@_date: 2015-04-20 02:00:05
I respect that better that but its still has value. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:52:23
I think the old meat has more of that seems they get hurt so bad they want to start downvoting like little lady boys with hurt feelings from someones post.
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:52:09


Yeah I was trying to decrease division of religions but people love their divisions and kill each other for it. Trying to be a peacekeeper but it destroyed my comment Karma. Let everyone know calm down if we all have a creator it wouldnt be one way but many. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:15:07
Right about that. Im no fan of them but everyone likes different things so they get the option. Whatever floats their boat.
@_date: 2017-10-06 16:25:27
Dont lie
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:57:12
I agree no one should be promoting here I posted a few questions about Bitcoin and instead of getting more answers I got more downvotes. But a few were able to help. My question was about the different forks..people tend to go straight to the source to get answers and to come here and get downvoted for information is not a good look for this sub. Dont make excuses for the unkind people here.
@_date: 2017-10-06 02:26:54
First youre response is exactly why I made this post
Second youre response is exactly why I made this post
People who come for basic bitcoin help see this sub as a way to get help and you just made it clear youre not willing to help but find an excuse not to which explains the shitty atmosphere you helped create
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:45:09
Religion discussion... I got downvoted trying to tell people in religious subs if God exists he wouldnt appreciate them thinking they have the only correct religion and if he did give religion to man he would have given them more than one guide to follow throughout history...so a few of those posts got downvoted by the hundreds because they like their boxes.
@_date: 2017-09-21 02:08:32
Yeah its not a good image hopefully the miners/developers get their act together before it starts scaring people away. Its already confusing enough.
@_date: 2015-04-21 16:40:38
Thats from my adventures on religious forums, look at my link Karma brother. I dont spam at least you know that. People go crazy about God if your belief is even slightly different but it was a past hobby. 
@_date: 2015-04-20 01:50:55
you mean your a crybaby girl with no life so you became a girly man snitch. All coins have something to do with bitcoin for investment if not then the mods will tell me and remove. I know each sub is different some mods have a life and are not little girly men like you and see it as related. Until then be a man and mind your own business stop acting like a girl.
People like you ruin fun for everyone else cause you think you can speak for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:24:53
So do fees go to miners?
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:41:57
ok makes sense now thanks for being nice about my question.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:54:17
go away Im not Doctor Phil go see a endocrinoligist if you get that upset over reddit like to butt in
@_date: 2017-07-30 02:10:25
Good idea whats your address?
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:59:14

@_date: 2017-07-18 19:14:01
I didnt say that if you read it and I didnt curse did I like him? And you dont want to battle me lol
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:47:34
Good details thanks I had no clue how it worked but now Bitcoin makes more sense
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:34:18
Ok calling me a dumbass is respecting me? use your brain... my advice to you is to take the advice I gave that other guy/girl
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:48:25
Maybe certain subs have impolite behavior and its annoying posting and someone responding like an idiot instead of answering and downvoting posts. And I didnt insult everyone and you are taking it personal go argue with someone else
