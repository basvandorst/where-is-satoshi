oh, and although it is technically not impossible to generate the same address, the odds are so infinitesimal that it may as well be considered impossible.
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:51:30
In my opinion, yes. I think that home computers being widely infected with god knows what is one of the biggest obstacles that Bitcoin faces. 
My best advice: Download the [project zip file]( for [bitaddress.org]( from its [Github site]( Extract it to your machine and run it locally, ideally offline. Print out paper wallets, and any amount of Bitcoin more than you would feel comfortable keeping in your real wallet for a walk down the street, put in a paper wallet.
This isn't foolproof. A really clever virus could be watching your offline activities and reporting back once you're online, or bitaddress.org might have a backdoor in even the source code that nobody has spotted, or someone might steal the paper wallet or it might burn in a fire, etc. 
Take what precautions you can to solve those, but even if you don't, it's certainly a better approach than leaving $7k in a hot wallet stored several places all protected by weak passwords.

What am I missing about the significance of the 31st?

Can I come?

Yeah, I've been pondering this idea to figure out if he's implying something I'm forgetting, but I can't come up with any case in which you're not correct here.
@_date: 2014-01-29 03:14:49
Awesome. Just bought five shirts. Hadn't heard of you guys before, you've got some great designs on there.
@_date: 2014-01-29 06:44:34
Sweet. OP is willing, folks.
Does anybody have a better idea for how to do a bounty than handing someone all the coins or just counting on everyone to deliver after the fact?
I'm perfectly willing to part with my BTC if someone cracks it, but I'm not rich enough to be willing to just toss out 1 BTC that may just sit in a hole while no one succeeds, if there's a better option.
@_date: 2014-01-29 05:56:36
Didn't you hear? The guy who owns Bitcoin just got arrested!
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:12:10
he's talking about the belief of the market. Previously it appeared that all three existed, now we know that only two of those three exist.
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:41:38
You and I have different definitions of "wrong", apparently.
@_date: 2014-02-04 01:03:08
No one doesn't know the answer to this question.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:52:50
What is the point of publishing a hash of his name then...? Describe the scenario you're picturing, I don't understand.
@_date: 2014-01-05 16:27:13
So Bitcoin addresses have public and private keys, and the address is based on the public key. This means that you can print out your private key and public address, and send bitcoins to the public address. The coins will then belong to that address, and will be recorded as such in the blockchain. Later, when you need to spend it, you import the private key into a bitcoin client, and now you have control over the coins that belong to it. Does that make enough sense?
I use blockchain.info to keep track of several 'watch only' addresses, where blockchain.info has never known what the private key is. Since all transactions are public in the bitcoin blockchain, it's easy for them to keep track of the current balance in each address, but since they don't have corresponding private key, it's impossible for them to spend it.
I'm sure other clients are capable of the same thing, it's just that I use them in particular for my watch only wallets.
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:38:31
OP: I'm willing to donate at least 1BTC to a bounty to test this, and I'm sure others would contribute. Are you willing to agree to this, and agree to confirm if someone busts you? Obviously not to post your actual information here, but just confirm if someone succeeded.
@_date: 2014-03-05 00:26:05
Do people really base purchasing decisions on the store listed "original prices"? I had assumed that Amazon.com and every department store I'd ever been in have been doing this for years...
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:58:35
Correct me if I'm missing something, but wouldn't it be easier to just ask OP if they were correct? OP could post a hash of jibberish, so it's not a matter of trusting him/her to confess, and by not posting a hash, OP ensures that nobody can be 100% certain of his/her identity without OP knowing. Seems safer for OP, and reduces the risk of someone believing a false negative because they didn't capitalize the right letters or something.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:25:19
The assumption, I think, is that the thieves have been using or selling them, since the theft hadn't been noticed and prices were still high, and thus the appearance of more coins would exist.
If the coins were just sat on, you're probably right I would think.
@_date: 2014-01-28 14:52:27
It's being upvoted because there's a difference between doing something dumb and doing something wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-05 04:49:08
To protect ~$7k, people can bother to setup [Keepass]( or something similar and use long, random passwords.
But realistically, there's just almost no good reason to have that much money in a hot wallet, especially on someone else's server, regardless of password strength.

Gimme an address kid. I'll double it.

Not replacing, just accessing or copying, and then reading the hashes from it. Then you can boot the machine back up in Windows and pass those hashes (again, assuming local admin) from anywhere on the local network.


Yeah I've loved most of the security stuff I've read about Win8, I just wish I didn't hate everything about trying to actually use it. -_- I even have a tablet, and it's still horrible. IMO of course.


Maybe I'm just lucky, but I successfully grab PEAP MS-CHAP credentials on a solid four out of five wireless tests I do, and successfully crack at least one of the credentials on about two out of three of those. I also manage to crack a PSK about one or two times out of five that I see it.
On the other hand, I haven't come across WEP with data traffic or devices on it while doing a pentest in quite some time.
What I'm seeing personally is that everybody has gotten their act together with laptop configurations. None of those ever connect to me these days, they just reject my fake certificate. However, everybody has started connecting their phones to the corporate wifi network... and those almost never have any sort of wireless security enabled to enforce checking the certificates.
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:01:39


Yep. You actually need two files if you want to do it on another system, one of which I can't remember off the top of my head, but it can be done. And you don't really need to copy it anyway, Ophcrack boot disk or any similar tool can just tell you the hashes and you can write it down/save to a USB/take a picture/whatever.


hehe yeah, I know how that game goes... -_-
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:20:03
Worth noting that this alone means nothing from a network security standpoint, because it's the same code running from your hard drive as it would be running from the website. If there were a backdoor in it, it would work exactly the same.
This can be improved a lot if you disconnect your computer from the internet while you run it, and close the page before you re-connect.
Ideally you would save the code (to be sure it doesn't change) and read (and understand) the source code well enough to be sure there's nothing nefarious in it.

Bitcoin gives you the control over your own money that cash does, the investment value that gold does, and the ease of transfer that institutions like PayPal do.
Bitcoin (properly implemented) does not give you the risk of physical theft or loss that cash does, the difficulty of spending small amounts that gold does, or the risk of a controlling entity screwing you over that PayPal does.

Was just talking to my grandparents the other day about BTC, and realized that I don't want them buying any themselves, because they'll just get their computer hacked.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:39:49


It's dead simple if you're physically in the same room as an unencrypted hard drive, which is the scenario implied by Arlunden.


I need to read up on it as well, but I haven't actually come across a single target using it. Hopefully I'll get around to that before I do :-D


Or if you have some patience, a little luck, and they're using WPA1/2-PSK or an insecurely configured device connecting to WPA1/2 Enterprise and PEAP (or other similar) and their PSK or RADIUS password is in your wordlist.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:25:30
I have no idea, I just wanted to copy the more or less official explanation over here.
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:38:13
It doesn't really matter. Once you have the hashes, you can use them to sign in to the box over the network as the user, assuming the user is a local admin on his own box. If not, you sign in as an admin, and then jump to the target user.
Or you just use this:  It's been awhile since I've used that one, but I don't think it had trouble with encrypted profiles.
But really it doesn't matter, because this entire part of the discussion assumes someone has literally broken into the guy's house and accessed his machine. In that case there are bigger problems and easier ways to get the information, from physical keyloggers to lead pipes.

Olaf: "Hey guys - sorry for the undue worries here.
In short, we had a syntax error in the ACH file we submitted to the bank last night.  By the time we corrected it, the "bank cutoff" for the day had already past, although we submitted it only half an hour or so later.  The net effect of this is what you're currently seeing - orders marked as "completed" because we have actually sent the instructions to the bank but they won't be processed until this evening when the bank does their daily processing.  One of the unfortunate downsides of working within the traditional financial system (and their very old codebase), and why I love Bitcoin.
Wanted to make sure you guys understood what was going on!"
