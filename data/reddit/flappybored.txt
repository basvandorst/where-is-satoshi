Bitcoin is a fiat currency btw. You shouldn't be spreading inaccurate information like that. 
@_date: 2014-09-02 06:08:10
What's the point in that you might as well get paid in normal currency. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 19:28:15
No because a ton of idiots told a bunch of other idiots that their 'investments' in bitcoin would be worth 20 grand each by now.
@_date: 2014-07-31 16:20:50
Hahahaha, good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-12-05 13:57:08


Lol, you do realise that this is the sub where people will gamble thousands of their own or their families money on bitcoin because they read a reddit comment about how some guy thinks it might raise in value.
@_date: 2014-12-07 02:11:49
People don't hate the technology, they hate the community and subs like this one that come off as a massive culty weirdo conspiracy religion that constantly tries to bring up bitcoin in everything it can.
Communities like this one have done more to damage Bitcoins image than any mass media outlet has.

So by 'Go Nuclear', you mean create a subreddit full of moron bitcoin circlejerkers(as if this one isn't already enough)  that will only be read by other bitcoin circlejerkers and  youthink that will somehow 'convince' the populous to all convert to using bitcoin in droves. Yeah, thats really gonna work. 
Genuinely, no one outside of this subreddit cares about this 'campaign'.
@_date: 2014-08-23 19:26:08
Yes, the UK is going to leave the EU for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:33:05
More stupid cult like 'patting your self on the back' retardedness from this sub.
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:55:21
TIL Bitcoin is a British invention.
@_date: 2014-05-26 16:00:02
Whats the point in taking bitcoin then.
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:01:16
This sub sucks, its like an AA meeting mixed with a doomsday cult.
@_date: 2014-07-03 23:23:48
Yes, everyone who disagrees with BTC is working for BoA.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:43:46
People will keep saying it even it it reached $0.001 and it was 30 years in the future and no one ever talked about Bitcoin.
People are simply addicted to it and treat it like gambling so just dump money into it hoping they get rich. For many Bitcoin is basically like a gambler addicted to the lottery and this sub directly encourages it with gamblers patting themselves on the back for spending more or dumping more into it. 
Just look at that comment below. 'I'm buying more, I hope it will go mainstream and very popular in 2015'
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:21:38
Ahaha, wait so you literally set up a fake profile on Tinder using stock photos so you could ask random girls about bitcoin? 
Lmfao this is hilarious.

"All economists who think USD will collapse are geniuses and we should heed their word as proof that Bitcoin will be a success"
Next Day:
"All economists who think BTC will collapse are idiots and I know more than them because I buy bitcoin every week, we should ignore their word and believe that Bitcoin will be a success" 
This is how most peoples logic works here.
@_date: 2015-04-05 23:58:49
The OP is literally in here posting quotes from the Bible as proof that 'taxes r bad'.
This sub is not mentally sane.
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:22:42
No it wasn't you're the one who's pulling out the strawman.


It's literally what you said.
First OP came out with a stupid quote that 'now is always a good time to buy bitcoin' claiming that there never is and never will be a poor time to purchase bitcoin as an investment despite this being demonstrable false to anyone who's not a moron. Then you bring out 'WELL WHAT ABOUT STOCKS AND LAND', despite people never saying that those things are good investments ALL the time.
If land value is lowering people tell you not to buy, if a company is failing people not to buy. If bitcoin is failing OP is telling them to BUY BUY BUY BECOZ ITS AWAYS A GOOD INVESTMNET!!1111 and yet you claim this is 'sound logic'.


Because you're clearly an unbias third party without an agenda right? You're the one who has to push something as hard as possible and the one who has money involved in it, not me you're the one with the bigger agenda. You HAVE to lie and manipulate data to defend your own investment in Bitcoin, I don't. I'm more impartial than you.
If some guy was trying to sell you a HP and telling you that HP is amazing and better than other competitors because of x,y,z and had shares and is invested in HP would you say he is unbias or had an agenda to manipulate information to sell you HP products?

Pay off all your debt. Waste money after.
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:00:26
'lol jesus said banks nd rich ppl r bad, btw y r u guys into bitcoin? i cant wait til it worth $10 mill and i beom rich!! go jesus! -op
@_date: 2015-04-06 00:10:07
Except you're not following logic at all because you're comparing vastly different things in an attempt to create a strawman.
'YEAH WELL IF U THINK BITCOINS ARE BAD, I GUESS U MUST THINK OWNING LAND IS BAD 2 HUH? CHECKMATE BUTCOINER!'
This is your logic. I'm not responding to 'logic' because there is no 'logic' in your posts, just strawmen and delusion.

It's coming from people being extremely butthurt that smart and successful people are not jerking themselves non-stop over Bitcoin and don't hate minorities.
