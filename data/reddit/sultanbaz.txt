Can you ELI5 this and the steps to do so? Do I need coding knowledge? Literally have none but what would you recommend if I need to? Code academy is P dope so maybe I could swing it.

God, I literally invested at such a weird time for Bitcoin, lol. I'm such a noob, still learning the game (never even traded stocks)...Can someone explain to me how to prepare myself even for this whole Segwit? 
I've yet to receive my Trezor, am I fucked? I've updated my Coinbase app because it stated that I need to have the most recent version to get the access to the new assets (I believe they're referring to how you're basically given free btc or a portion of btc [depending on how much you've invested] once the fork hits?) Idk if this is a an advertising ploy, but I downloaded it anyway to be safer than sorry. 
AM I ON THE RIGHT TRACK? Freaking out a little. I have like .3 BTC currently, lol. Any help is appreciated - thanks in advance.

this is a great resource, thank you so much. this is definitely along the lines of what I'm looking to understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:36:04
I'm going to buy a ledger or trezor. What do you feel about that? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:36:52
this is why I love the bitcoin community, no matter how hard they shit on my noobiness. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:49:52
Ah, see now we're on the right track. So people "noticing" is an external factor. They realize it can be a good investment. 
Now, what other factors such as this one influence the price of BTC to rise or fall? Thanks for your feedback. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:38:53
definitely trying my best. I knew it was a ratio equation, I just wanted to be sure I was doing it correctly. but i appreciate your concern. 
wishing you the best, my friend. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:16:22
thank you, thank you, thank you. These are the kinds of answers I'm looking for. 
also thank you for the book recommendation! i'm glad to see it's an ebook as well. I'm completely new to investing and stocks and all of that, so I'm just trying to understand the process and psychology behind it all in order to position myself better in the market. thanks so much.

Can someone ELI5 for this? Super new to bitcoin still researching but I haven't gotten to this particular topic. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:02:34
Is Coinbase not essentially the same thing as Electrum? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:49:00
this is so sketchy
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:14:59
thanks new to this. ty!
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:24:06
Yes, but what causes the demand? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:10:49
thank you - this is what I was looking for. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 01:00:55
The wave has hit, fam. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:28:43
is [this]( the white paper you're referring to? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:23:57
Oops I think I replied to the wrong post. I don't have full coins yet as I've just invested yesterday and they're currently on coinbase. 
I'm researching Trezor vs ledger in terms of storage right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:24:07
Bought at 7300 around two weeks ago. I just want it to keep going down so I can buy more. Am I wrong for this? 
Still a super noob. I researched that crashes were bound to happen, but I'm still hoping for an actual crash, not something like this, lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:47:40
okay so let me get this straight - 
right now, there's a money supply of around $16.7M (found [here]( Because of this "finite supply", people want more of it, which means the price goes up.
What influences supply, then? Is it just people mining and selling it? What causes people to wanting to sell? Demand? What causes the demand? Is it really _*just*_ supply? There has to be other reasons, for instance - "oh this looks like a good investment"
Am I overthinking this? I just want to figure out what external trends/reasons people have for demanding bitcoin. The overarching concept of supply and demand makes sense, but there have to be layers to this onion. But maybe I'm wrong...
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:33:31
I really don't know if I should take y'all seriously. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:34:03
Like obviously supply and demand but what external factors cause these? More mining, etc? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:25:08
Can you explain this concept of a short seller? And how it would tie with the "futures"? Also why are they called "futures"? Super noob here. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:21:59
Does this really bother you? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:08:40
mans not hot
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:23:42
nice one bro
@_date: 2017-04-25 10:11:08
I don't understand any of this ��
@_date: 2015-11-09 01:40:37
thanks so much for these responses y'all, lol. you guys got heated af. going to look further into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:15:49
for instance why should I be worried about what method the consumer pays me in. why would I want them specifically to pay using the bitcoin method?
