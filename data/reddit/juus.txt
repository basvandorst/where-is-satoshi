I know you are kidding, but a gasoline spill on your property can greatly reduce its value.
@_date: 2019-07-26 12:10:11
Yes. It is terrible for the economy if cash sits unused and uninvested.
@_date: 2019-07-26 11:43:37
It would be terrible for the economy if they did.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:37:23
The state of that staircase fits perfectly well with the current state of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-27 09:39:58


How can you be so sure?
To me it looks like there is a much greater chance that BTC will never be able to compete with any current payment systems, and if it fails as a viable payment system for the masses, then i don't see it being a good 'store of value' long term.
@_date: 2019-03-20 09:40:56
Hopefully no one will base their investments on a tie they saw on TV. 
@_date: 2019-11-13 08:22:31
But where would all their wealth come from?
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:39:09


I disagree that it is good store of value. I think most people agree that you shouldn't store value in an asset that can drop 80% in around a years time. This makes it a good asset for speculation though, which is what i'm using it for. 


For most people, there are cheaper, better, easier and faster ways to send and receive money. Almost everyone has a need to send and receive money and do so, but almost no one uses Bitcoin for it. Why do you think that is?
@_date: 2019-03-26 19:16:27


Isn't the whole point of Bitcoin that it is a payment system?
@_date: 2019-11-15 14:51:22


You are saying that like that would be easy. How will Bitcoin create adoption, when for most people it is an inferior means of payment than what they are already using?
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:15:14


Then diversify into that asset class if you think it has a future, but don't go 100% in on it, because you don't know the future of that asset class. Would you go 100% in and why?
@_date: 2019-11-27 09:42:47


No one in their right mind would be hoarding fiat. They are hoarding wealth.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:00:27
Hard money isn't necessarily good, especially not for wealthy people. You have to diversify your wealth with investments. Bitcoin is more speculation, isn't it?
For a lot of people money is already borderless, and many people don't really care too much about it since they don't need it to be borderless that often. Don't get me wrong, it is a great feature of Bitcoin, but i don't think it is worth enough for people to fully adopt Bitcoin. 
Same with BTC being permissionless, but it isn't something most people care too much about because they don't have a use for it.
This isn't a necessarily a good thing. It isn't good for the economy and it isn't good for late adopters. It is only good for speculators like you and me.
Also, just because something is scarce, doesn't make it valuable, if there is no demand for it. You can't create demand for something because it is scarce, without making it a bubble. Why would you buy something for the sole purpose of it being scarce? 
Bitcoin needs to create a bigger demand for it to gain traction.
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:15:11
But why would they buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-15 11:09:44
In some african countries, digital money is already more popular than cash. Unfortunately, they didn't go the Bitcoin way, as far as i know.
@_date: 2019-11-15 12:08:22
I don't think so, but i'm not sure. Try Googling Digital money in africa if you are interested.
@_date: 2018-10-02 18:31:03
I like money. 
@_date: 2018-10-09 13:55:27
Looks like a bowl of sadness. 
@_date: 2019-11-15 14:45:00
Just because you were lucky that a decision paid off, doesn't make it a sound decision. Putting your money on green at the roulette table is a terrible decision, even if you get lucky and it actually hits green. Don't you agree?
What does store of value mean to you?  For me BTC is good to diversify into in speculation purely based on previous rise in it's price. But it is a terrible idea to put 100% of your assets into BTC with the idea of storing your value or net worth. 
Anyways, my point is, that relying on price increase based on this notion that it will increase in price, is basically relying on a prophecy that has to be self fulfilling. 
It is like telling someone to buy BTC because it will rise in price, and when they then ask why it will increase in price, you reply with the reason that they buy it. No one will buy it with that reasoning.
@_date: 2019-11-14 12:09:29


How will it do that you think?
@_date: 2019-11-14 07:59:00
Airbnb, Uber, Lyft and all the other gig economy businesses, Instagram, Snapchat and a bunch of other social media platforms, self driving cars are pretty much ready from several different companies, we figured out how to reuse spacerockets. Those are just the ones off the top of my head, try googling for the biggest technological advancements of the decade, you'll find and recognize plenty more. It's been a great decade.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:42:44
My credit card gives me a 5% cash back on purchases in cafés and restaurants. The transaction is contactless, instant and much safer than using  Bitcoin. Why would i pay with bitcoin at a café? 
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:44:52
It is accurate. 
@_date: 2018-10-19 06:43:24
Correct. Their share of the cut was around 230 million USD, if i remember correctly. 
@_date: 2019-11-09 17:29:07


Don't forget, there are no guarantees of this.
@_date: 2018-10-03 07:01:05
I only pay interest if i don't pay off my debt within 45 days, which i always do. No annual fee, no transaction fee and no account fee. 
Maybe there is a transaction cost for the seller, i don't know, but for me it is 100% free money. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 09:51:33
You are right. Accepting credit cards has a cost to it, and that cost is passed on to all of the customers, so i'm guessing the guy paying with Bitcoin along with everyone else, is actually financing my cash back incentive. Works for me. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:03:55

I don't care about the tech and i don't really care about this meme community called i care about making money. It is the same with my investments in stock, i don't care about Disney movies, but i do want to make money off my investment in Disney. 
@_date: 2019-11-09 01:58:15
I think that you are underestimating how long 10 years really is, in this day and age.
@_date: 2018-10-02 08:05:49
Personally i prefer to purchase stuff with my airline credit card so i get a reward. It is a much safer and faster transaction as well. 
@_date: 2019-11-15 14:37:12


Obviously it doesn't make sense to compare the worth of one BTC to another BTC. You have to compare the value of 1 BTC to either another currency or to something of value. The value of 1 BTC in hamburgers at Mcdonalds for example.

Most people who try to get rich quick end up getting poor quick. For most people it is better to take it slow and diversify your investments, or start up your own business.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:15:29


Where are you getting your numbers? The EURO and USD are both around 2% average the last 10 years. 
Even so, who cares? You are not supposed to hold huge amounts of cash or currency anyway, invest your money and keep 3-6 months expenses in cash and you are good.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:53:49
Interesting, I think I understand your point, but I want to learn more, can you point me in the right direction?
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:02:24
There are investments in between 2% a year and all or nothing investments
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:31:14
Okay, i understand. You don't have to be slick at all to invest anymore though, Fintech is pretty far in most western countries and it is insanely easy to invest in proper diversified companies with automatic setups and without having any major knowledge. It is only a matter of time, before you will have that possibility in your country as well, if you don't already.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:03:18


I assume you mean BTC. I disagree that there is any value in buying something and selling it to the next buyer for more. Making people rich in a currency simply because they were there first, doesn't make any sense to me.
@_date: 2019-10-18 14:37:43
Most people don't care about the property of money, other than what you can spend it on. You know that, right?
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:23:17
Just invest in a passive fund, that way you don't have to know anything about individual stocks and you don't really have to reallocate your assets in your diversification. 


According to the CPI index you would need 251 USD in 2019 to buy the same thing in 1984 that you would get for 101 USD.
If you invested 101 USD in 1984 and assumed the average return of 8% then you would compound the 100 USD into 1493 USD, so i don't see how that is following inflation? Seems to me that it is better.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:03:35
Well, common financial sense. Currencies are a tool to transfer and value intrinsic value. There are no inherent value in a currency, but it is useful to value something. Instead, put your wealth in stuff with real value, like real estate or stocks. If you buy a house for 100k USD and USD suddenly disappeared, you still have your value in your house, although valued in another currency.
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:46:29
No one who is saving money for their kids are saving it in pure USD. They invest to make it grow and to avoid inflation.
@_date: 2019-10-17 07:14:51
Don't forget to diversify your investments. There are no guarantees that Bitcoin will ever catch on.

I'd rather use my credit cards when i can, it is safer and i get cashback or other perks when i use them. They are also free to use in my country.
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:43:23


That probably depends on your plan. I know you can get it instantly here with some plans.
@_date: 2019-10-17 19:22:57
I dont understand, why would people use bitcoin or accumulate bitcoin if the payment option sucks?

I don't have Venmo in my country but we do have several similar apps in my country. With the app i'm using the money goes straight to my bank account, are you sure it isn't the same with Venmo?

That is a local thing. Cash is definitely not king my area.

Why would i ever send money to North Korea? I'm with you that BTC is useless for mainstream uses, i was just trying to point out that you are wrong in your preconceptions about Iran. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:30:23
Why do you think so? The middleman will cover fraudulent charges. With BTC you are just fucked. 
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:15:06
Bitcoin has had 10 years in the golden age of technology to evolve it self, and paying with it is still wonky, harder, unsafer, slower and not nearly as good as any other payment systems out there. Why is that? When will Bitcoin compete with my other payment options? I won't believe in the success of Bitcoin, until it can offer me a better alternative than my current choices.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:44:46
I don't think you can expect that what you produced in 2019 and was paid for in 2019 will have the same value in 2029. That is another way of seeing it. Why are you so opposed to investing?
@_date: 2019-10-11 11:26:28
Same in Denmark. It is more expensive to accept cash than to accept cards. I'm assuming the small business in the picture is just trying to cheat on their taxes, which is much easier with cash.
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:42:27
Everyone in Iran has a smartphone. More people in the world have access to a smartphone than they do a toilet. A smartphone isn't a luxury anymore, you can get them for as cheap as 10 USD. 
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:44:00
I think it will only be possible if Bitcoin evovles into something with a real usecase that can compete with current payment systems.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:52:43
Well, it is true though.
@_date: 2019-12-03 22:25:30

@_date: 2019-12-18 14:07:35
I don't think they see Bitcoin as that big a threat.
@_date: 2019-12-04 09:36:23
I can imagine there is a significant amount of people, who will probably see a 20k USD BTC as a good price to step out of the market and break even.

@_date: 2019-10-24 18:18:02


It doesn't seem like it, when i am reading about it here 
Do you think they are cheating by undervaluing 80.000 consumer goods? Cheating enough for a 100 usd to almost 1500 usd increase in the stock market is worthless?
How are investors rich as fuck, if the stock market really only follows the inflation?
@_date: 2019-12-10 16:54:16
Why is the pour so slow?
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:27:08
Thats cool. But why should people buy my BTC for a thousand times more than what i paid for it?
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:20:56
If you have 10 Million, you can theoretically make 800k a year on average in the stockmarket, if you assume 8% gains which is the normal assumption from the S&amp;P500. If you are making 800k passively, then i'm guessing most people will be happy to 'leave' 80k on the table and save themselves 40 hours a week at a job.
@_date: 2019-12-27 16:54:25
Just pay with fiat right away. It is cheaper than paying with BTC and then buying more BTC from an ATM, that will cost your big fees.
@_date: 2019-12-03 14:04:15
That makes sense. But does it even matter to computers though?
@_date: 2019-12-03 13:55:01
Well, said &gt;you're wasting time if you still work in almost every job.
so i was generous and gave the fictious person an 80k job. It is pretty rare to earn 500k a year, so i assumed it wasn't the case.
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:03:41
Tesla is an "alt stock" though. If you have to compare the market cap bounce with anything, compare it with the S&amp;P500 or similar. 
@_date: 2019-12-04 07:58:23
Yeah, obviously. But Bitcoin mining is basically just working an algorithm to see who has the hardware to do it best, so why does it matter what they actually solve?
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:57:45
Because Bitcoin has no intrinsic value. The value is only going up with adoption, and adoption will probably never happen by the general public. The downsides to switching to Bitcoin is greather than the upside, for the general public. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 10:27:39
Yeah, then i'd definitely incorporate Bitcoin in my payment mix. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:48:48
No i am not joking. There is a limited supply of sand too. It might be abundant, but it still has a limited supply. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 10:41:55
Honestly, the banks have a much better product than BTC for the average person. No fees, better security, instant transfers. Atleast in my country. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:58:09
Why do you think that stocks are speculation? 
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:30:26
Probably a 25% fee like usual or something ridiciulous like that. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 16:14:03
I get a cashback incentive or airline miles on my credit cards. They are instant, safe and contactless. Why would i ever switch to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-01-24 12:27:35
The average person doesn't care about any of those things, which is why i said average person. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:14:50
There is a limited supply of gold too. Gold has a use case as well, it can't be forked and cloned. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:37:19
I'd rather have a 67 billion stake in Apple than in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:26:13
I know. My point is that anyone can make a bitcoin. You can't really just make a new precious metal. 
@_date: 2019-09-12 16:04:31
I'm not talking about market cap, i'm talking about a use case that warrants its market cap.
@_date: 2019-09-12 09:52:04
Bitcoin has had 10 years in the golden age of technology to evolve, and how far it has reached in that timeframe is very underwhelmning.
@_date: 2019-09-15 12:58:20
Putting half of your investment portfolios in Bitcoin or cryptocurrency is terrible advice.
@_date: 2019-09-12 13:06:22
There are plenty of examples of Fintech disruptions that with little problems disrupted part of the financial industry or atleast had their piece of the cake. Paypal, Stripe, p2p lending, crowdfunding, venmo, robinhood, are just the ones off the top of my head that i can think of.  
What is stopping Bitcoin from taking off?
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:46:47
That is probably a billion in bitcoin that isn't very liquid, how will he use it or turn it into FIAT? Also, moving a billion is kinda niche, isn't it?
Why is it so valuable that he can move a billion? Tax fraud?
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:53:54
Where's Myspace?
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:23:06
I don't think that would happen. Did you ever see any stores offer a discount if you paid by cash? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:54:11
Yeah me too.  I'd never switch out my credit cards unless there is something in it for me.
@_date: 2018-12-17 14:14:25
Why do i need to understand more than the basic understanding i currently have? I don't have to understand how to fix my car either, i just need to know how to drive it. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:20:16
All my credit cards have an integrated contactless payment option. Just hold up my credit card next to the machine and the payment will occur. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 23:48:14
My creditcard is feeless, as long as i pay off my debt within 45 days, it is instant, it is contactless, it is protected against theft and fraud, it even rewards me with a cashback or other reward. Why would someone like me ever switch to paying with Bitcoin? Bitcoin isn't safe, it is hard to use, it has fees, it's slow and it offers no valuable incentives. I like the idea of disrupting the banking business, but to be honest, i just don't care enough to give up the other perks.
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:02:28
I'm guesing that Credit card providers make most of their money on transaction fees paid by the seller and not the late payment fees. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:04:28
The only thing of those you mention, that will help increase mainstream adoption is user friendliness. But it has been 10 years now, will it ever be user friendly? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:32:10
Monopoly money. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:43:51
Same here. I travel 5-8 times a year and i've never had any major payment issues with my cards. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 02:00:09
Again 99% of people will never have any problems in the destinations they are going to. We are talking about mainstream adoption. Yes it might be hard to use our VISA cards in Somalia, but significant amount of people goes there. And if you do go there you can solve that problem with good old fashioned cash. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:21:55
Interesting, do you know any projects worth mentioning? 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:42:35
I really think you are underestimating how long 10 years are in our day and age. Also, BTC is a payment system. It isn't exactly something totally game breaking
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:11:57
That is what people feared when they first came out. The tech has been pretty widespread for 3-5 years in my country now, and no one talks about that fear anymore. It simply doesn't happen. I have multiple cards in my wallet with the technology and most readers can't read my whole stack in my wallet. Also there is a max withdrawal amount of 350 DKK (around 50 usd) 5-10 times in a row, then it asks for my PIN. And even if my card does get misused my bank will cover 100% of the stolen funds. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:36:08
How long did it take for Venmo to gain traction? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:10:54
But you are paying through an encrypted gateway, so the merchant won't know your credit card details. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:39:49
Probably not, but it will spread to the less developed nations. So i guess BTC is already an outdated technology. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 01:18:01
Once it goes live i expect the BTC price to drop a few days after. The community has hyped it up too much, and once people realize it won't start a bull run then it will enhance the bear market. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:18:33
I get a 5% cashback on my creditcard from purchases in restaurants, cafés and bars, so unfortunately i have no incentive to pay with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:30:52
I pay almost nothing to my bank, and what i do pay i make back in cashbacks. I never missed a payment, and i won't miss one either. I guess Bitcoin will never be used by people like me or by people who value UX higher than a small fee. Which is 99% of the population. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 07:27:13
