Lykke using Credit Card/Prepaid is good choice. I have no idea about paypal.

BCH is gonna die in 2020 if not way before that. Who cares what price is that shitcoin in the short-med term.

I love bitstamp. I’ve been using it since Feburary this year.

I think so. I had 3 of my friends sign up there last week and they are still pending verification.
Send an email to the support and see what happens.

For small amounts, I recommend Lykke . You can pay using credit card anywhere from the world, and the price most of the time exactly the same as the market. But even if its higher by 1-3% , for small amounts, it won’t hurt you because there are no fees. I started using it last month to buy small amounts of BTC for my friends just so they get started.
In case you want to buy a lot, then a traditional exchange is better. I use Bitstamp because coinbase doesn’t support my country (Thank GOD!), but people here are also recommending Gimini.

We call shorts Bermuda in my country (an ME country). Now I finally know why! Now my life is complete now!

It is the only altcoins exchange that I use. I run a bot on BTC market. Great experience so far.
I wasn’t affected by today’s issue because I am paranoid and pay a lot of attention to security, like typing the Binance url every time I visit it, especially after seeing those phishing sites that uses unicode characters. And checking my API keys setting regularly to make sure that they are still restricted to my server’s IP. Today’s “hack” was actually because of phishing sites creating API keys that hackers used to place orders on the victims accounts
Anyway. People got their funds back, which is incredible! And what is better, they got them in BTC!

That was back in December when fees were ridiculously high. I remember reading the article back then and thinking it is cool. Of course 0.001btc is too high now.

Mine was “at the request of your nation’s central bank”. I had to go and check the sub to confirm because I live in a country that actually banned BTC and I could see our central bank hunting us down ��
Happy April 1st and have a great weekend everybody!

Kinda hope Satoshi is Hal Finney. But can’t complain if he is Nick Szabo. Nobody will ever know I guess, but at least we can all agree it is not Craig Wright.

The remaining 20% didn’t disappear right away, but they are neglecting the project until it eventually die.
