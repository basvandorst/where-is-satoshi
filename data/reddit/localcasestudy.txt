This is not accurate.  There are a couple ways of achieving this, sharebuilder is one of them:

Haha yup. The customer service rep could have looked at his city, ip address, AND chat history to see that everything matched up. I've had plenty of clients that start a chat and are surprised that we know who they are right away.

Agreed completely with you btw, and came here to type what you typed.  They presented an idea to a room full of people, someone took it and EXECUTED on it.  The end.

There is ethics and there is legality.  if you have legal recourse against this person, take it. if not this court of public opinion thing is rather silly in my opinion.   I live in the real world man, not in some make-believe idealized world that you've dreamed up.  The best you can do is look for the lesson in this situation and move on.  And ideas aren't worth nothing, they are worth LESS than nothing.   Value is extracted from them by either attaching legal protection to them through patents or by executing on them. And you've done neither. Good luck.

Yes, haha. Check kickstarter.  It's hilarious the percentage of projects on there that are just straight up scams and have raised $500,000 or more.  It's incredible!

Facts. Barbados guy here as well.  Maybe the poster was mixing up Barbados and Bermuda or Bahamas.

The author of the article is arguing the opposite of what you're saying.  Barbados is just not the place known for this.  Bahamas, Bermuda, Antigua...and you're on to something.  The author is saying that the entire thing is a misrepresentation.
I don't think you read it clearly. From the article:
Barbados is not a sleazy Caribbean backwater full of illegal, or barely legal, Canadian business men and women trying to hide the money they earned off the backs of the "Canadian taxpayer" in the omnipresent white sandy beaches that characterize the island.
By the CBC choosing to air the face of one black female Barbadian lawyer explaining to the undercover Canadian journalist how to capitalize on tax loopholes, they wrongly stereotype the legal profession in Barbados (and its legal professionals) as unscrupulous and deceitful.
Furthermore, Canadian business interests in Barbados and the Caribbean date well before the 1970s.

Yes it's a country that is only 21 miles long.
