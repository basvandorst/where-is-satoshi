Investors will stop panicking when they understand that BTC opens opportunities to large populations (and whole continents) that until recently were marginalized from being able to participate in formal banking systems with absolute freedom without authoritarian and punitive cost.  
I am not losing any sleep and neither should you.

No, some may be excluded at the moment, but with a few tweaks BTC will be accessible to them.  In fact, I am aware (first hand info.) that in regions of Africa and South America people are able to trade some of their income into BTC to counteract their countries devaluating currencies.  It may be pennies but it is a start.  What does one need? An ID and and a cellphone and perhaps dubious exchange outfits, but it is a start. 
I am an optimist, nevertheless, and I will bank my whole net worth in people’s ingenuity.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:12:40
If it does, I will buy a hell of lot of BTC
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:45:52
Thank you fellow Redditor
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:47:29
Don’t be.   Have faith.  I do.  And my faith is based on hard-core science.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:43:49
Crazy shit going on at the moment.  I am ready to buy more and hodl it as usual.

I agree with the belief that realizing that money can be highjacked by a government (i.e. US government shut down) illustrates the necessity to foster a ledger system independent of prepubescent control by puerile and flawed institutions.

Pleaze... don’t be such a drama queen
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:46:13
Just bought at $10K and Coinbase motherfucker froze my purchase.  WTF
Don’t we need buyers?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:15:44
And sisters...

All you need is a cellphone, an ID and a little money. As of today, they operate on an strictly cash market. I believe they operate in an  “informal market”  as Economists pejoratively define them. 
Don’t underestimate the masses. They may be excluded from the typical banking system, but they work hard and have the same aspirations and opportunities you and I have. 
And just to wrap it up.  Few people truly understand that being poor is expensive and onerous.  A poor person pays more for housing (per sq. foot), healthcare, education and often relies on shark loans in times of need, hits  a “point of diminishing returns” in terms of earning power.  However, with a few tweaks, BTC (block chain  decentralized ledger system) offers libertarian ideals and freedom from the shackles of capitalism gone astray.

It is an opportunity 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:50:25
I am in the same boat
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:08:05
I am not selling either. In fact. I am buying more BTC
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:53:20
Thank you  
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:40:47
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:36:16
Me too!!! But now we can buy more!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:33:12
Did my job. Bought BTC three times today as encouraged 
@_date: 2017-12-31 16:05:44
I am a new investor and slowly but surely I am getting to own my share of the BTC dream.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:37:38
Just bought a small chunk.  Regardless of the outcome I believe in the principle of BTC’s decentralization and libertarian principles.  End of story,  
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:59:46
Thank you darling
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:19:19
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:27:05
Yes, we are safe. Have faith!!! Believe in the fundamentals!!!
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:22:22
Coinbase is like a dry fuck
Too slow or pulls out of the gig when you are all fired up
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:35:46
Yes Sir!!!
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:40:50
How can anyone place any value on what McAfee says?
Please grow up
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:20:36
I just did...
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:23:21
HODL until the bitter end.
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:47:33
Have faith please
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:38:12
I will do the same.
To hell with those naysayers.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:19:29
It is over $10K and I just made my last investment. 
BTCfellows, our holding is paying off
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:11:58
Who the fuck cares? Markets are manipulated by spreading stupid rumors or facts. The reality is that is that if I want to invest in BTC nobody or nothing will stop me.
It is time to stop legitimizing stupid assertions or rumors by so called “experts”. I see it all the time, and it irritates the hell out of me.
In short, believe or get the fuck out!!!
I ain’t goin’ anywhere. I am staying.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:12:54
But sooner than we realize it, it will
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:45:33
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:51:18
Cheers fellow Hodlers!!! 
We are on our way up and nothing or nobody will stop us.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:18:03
I believe in the big idea 
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:15:29
Sky is not even the freaking limit bro.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:53:21
If you are asking, please do your homework and debate on the merits of the “potential wonders of BTC”
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:21:25
I am still acquiring BTC until I reach my comfort zone, and by then, I will put it away and leave it alone cognizant that I did my best to invest wisely, regardless of when the 100K eggs are going to hatch.
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:25:37
In the spirit of optimism, I just bought some BTC 
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:04:06
Just bought some BTC. At the moment I am teetering between being in the blue and red. I am willing to hodl because my faith is unshakable.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:46:26
Got ya!!! No problema hermano 
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:15:16
I also bought some at $9K but we are not going down fellow redditor. Just the value of our cajoled is being tested.  It is already bouncing back as predicted.
EDIT: typo cojones instead of cajoled
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:35:47
It will
