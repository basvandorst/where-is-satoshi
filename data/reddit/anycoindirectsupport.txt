Hello DonPabl094,
On the following [wiki]( you can see all wallets and exchanges which have integrated native segwit addresses. As nullc stated sending your coins to an exchange from a bech32 address shouldn't be a problem. You can also see on this wiki that most exchanges will allow you to send coins to a bech32 address.

Hello Ijc-90,
The mining fees that are required to ensure a swift confirmation are not proportional to the amount itself, but to the size of the transaction.
This amount is calculated in satoshis per byte.
Considering you pointed out that you have made the transfer from Bitinka, it is likely that the fees applied include the fee of this exchange. This would also explain how it seems to be proportional to the amount you transferred.

Hello WhichBoard4,  
At first we would like to note that mining on a single PC is not very profitable when mining BTC (Bitcoin). This is due to the high difficulty in mining pools and the rewards are minimal if your hashing power is only a very low percentage in the total hash power of the pool. You can also mine without a pool but this will require other steps to be taken.  
1.    You mention that power bills are not something of your concerns, which indicates that anything you mine will generate a profit. The height of this profit is easily calculated with certain tools available for use like this [website]( . Fill in your specs and the desired coins to mine and a profit will be calculated. Please note that this is an estimate and does not include any orphan blocks or pool downtime. We strongly recommend you to do some basic research on mining and what things you can expect. This [site]( is a very handy website for information regarding mining bitcoin)  
2.    There is a lot of variety for mining software, especially if you do not know which coin you are going to mine. It is best to look for projects that look interesting and profitable for you and then research the mining requirements on the website of the chosen coin. If this coin is listed on a certain exchange you will be able to trade the coins for Bitcoin.  
3.    In general, no, however you need to calculate that mining generates a lot of heat. If your hardware is not properly cooled during mining there is a chance of damaging your hardware. Aside from that it will not be dangerous.  
4.    This all depends on the coins you wish to mine and store. There are many types of wallet available for most of the coins out there and for every coin is a different wallet. The best thing to start with is creating a personal wallet. The best choice for choosing a software wallet is by going to the official website of the coin(s). Alternatively you can use [this guide]( that we have created, which should help you in deciding which wallet is right for you.

Hello kryptoneat,
To get an idea of how long a transaction will take before it gets confirmed by the blockchain, you will have to check the current rate of the fees. When you withdraw from an exchange it is typical that you are not able to change the fees the exchange uses by default.
If you know the amount of fee that is included with the transaction for your withdrawal, you can use a fee calculator to get a pretty good
estimate of the time it will take for the transaction to be confirmed. There are several sites on the internet that monitor the average height of the fees needed to ensure a swift confirmation.  A site you can use to make an educated guess on the current rates and their correlating confirmation time is [this]( one for example or this [one]( alternatively.
For an actual depiction of the current rates of fee, always be sure to check more than one site to confirm that the representation of these rates are up-to-date.
We always advise users to use their own personal wallet so that they have control over the amount of fees included.  In the scenario you described we realize this is not an option, and in this case you will have to know the size of the fee to make a decent prediction on the confirmation time.
With kind regards,

Hello AL_A17,
Have you tried using the [forgot-password function]( on the blockchain.info website? It allows you to enter your mnemonic phrase to recover your wallet. It could be that not having access to your email might hinder you from recovering the wallet via this method. However, we think they will be able to help you recover your account if you have all the previously mentioned login data. So probably your support ticket will not end up on a "not interested" pile.

We have left out the option of chosing for a paperwallet, because this does not enable you to access your coins without using another interface. Furthermore we also believe that keeping your private key on a piece of paper has certain risks that have to taken into account. That being said, when you don't need to move your coins often, this option becomes more attractive.

Hello speedkillz2,
During the setup process of your Electrum wallet, you have the option to select a new "Multi-signature wallet".
In this step of the configuration you can choose the number of signatures needed for you to unluck the funds in the wallet.
It appears that during these steps, you may have chosen the wallet to require 4 of 4 signatures instead of 2 out of 2 for example.
So you can not move the coins that are in the wallet, until you provide all 4 of the required signatures.

Hello VEugen,
To decide which wallet suits you best you will have look at the aspects that you value most. Do you prefer a user-friendly wallet or do you prioritize the security or maybe even just the accessibility aspect? When it comes to chosing a Bitcoin wallet that is most suitable for you as an individual, it is essential you look at these aspects to find the right one.
We have made the following list of the types of wallets that are available:
Full-node wallet: The official bitcoin core wallet containing the entire bitcoin blockchain can be found [here](
Lite wallet client : A software wallet which interacts with the bitcoin blockchain but doesn't need to download the entire blockchain. We suggest you use the Electrum wallet which can be found [here](
Hardware wallet: A hardware wallet is a piece of hardware that offers the option to securely store your private keys. We suggest you use the Ledger which can be bought [here](
Online wallet: A wallet which can be created online with very little effort we recommend an established name like Blockchain.info you can create a wallet [here](
The Full-node wallet could be considered if you prefer to have the software from the original developers, or just want to run a full-node on the Bitcoin-network. This can be secure, but it also requires you to download the entire Bitcoin blockchain which requires alot of disk space.
A lite wallet client also has certain advantages. They take less disk space, less time to synchronise and some of these offer a decent level of security as well.
The hardware wallet is probably the most secure option of them all, and this one also gives you access at any time if you keep it with you.
If you value accessibility over security a trusted webwallet might be the best option for you since you are able to access the wallet from any secured device that has an internet connection.

 Hello ethereumcpw,  
We usually recommend using a Ledger or Trezor on our website solely because they offer a wider variety of coins. Other reasons why we would recommend these wallets include their user-friendliness for beginners and their helpful support department.   
Please remember that you should always buy these wallets from the official websites, buying hardware wallets through 3rd parties puts your private keys at risk.  
The official Ledger website can be found [here]( and the official Trezor website can be found [here](

Hello TMA-NG,  
If the wallet app is no longer supported it will probably not broadcast your transaction to the network. Which wallet application did you use on your phone? There is a chance the distributor or developers sent out a message for users to transfer their coins.
Your best bet would be finding your private key or seed, like user Nesh\_ suggested above. If you have access to this information you might be able to import it in a new wallet such as Electrum. When the private key or seed has been imported in a new wallet your coins should be displayed again. Meaning you can spend them again as you wish.

Hello TaylorTWBrown,
There are several options for you to store your fraction of a bitcoin for a longer time. The most suitable option for you would be a lite wallet, like [Electrum](
Another option that you could go for is a hardware wallet like the [Ledger]( or a [Trezor]( This way you can easily store the portion of bitcoin you have,
and hold the coins there for when they become worth more. If you follow the instructions on the website for Ledger or Trezor, it is unlikely that you will make any big mistakes.
Alternatively you can opt to create a paper-wallet, and keep your private key on a piece of paper. This has certain risks that have to taken into account, for example you could lose the piece or it could become damaged.

Hello xxxsdpsn,
Yes, the easiest way to have a fast transaction is to higher the fee you pay for the transaction. We always suggest end-users to have access to a wallet where they can determine their own transaction fee. This gives the end-user a much higher level of costumization.  The [website]( you referred to shows the fee and the corresponding estimated time it will take to verify the transaction. Remember these averages are not always perfectly accurate but will give you a good insight into how large the fee is that you should atttach to your transaction.
There are a few other variables however that you need to take into account. For example on the following page you can see the size of the mempool [here]( If the mempool is very large it might take longer to process your transaction. So to make an ideal transaction check out both websites to get an overview of the current situation on the network and then choose an appropriate fee.

 Hello mickhick95,
There are several benefits to using bech32, it is known as the native SegWit address meaning it produces smaller transaction sizes than both legacy and p2sh. These smaller transaction sizes will help the scalability of Bitcoin in the long term and cost you a smaller fee per transaction in the short term.
On the following page [here]( you can see which wallets and exchanges have already adopted bech32. On top of this the letters used in the address are case-insensitive making it easier for people to use this type of address.

Hello Cluetube_unleash,
The first article we suggest you take a look at is the following: 
[How can cryptocurrency and blockchain technology play a role in building social and solidarity finance?](
This article not only discusses as a community built technological currency but also of the financial impact it has on a micro and macro scale. On top of this it takes a look at the libertarian vision on this advancement and how the blockchain technology in general could have an impact.
To continue on this note the following article tries to illustrate how larger companies and banks view this upcoming blockchain technology. This will give you an interesting view on how cryptocurrency adaption might be undermined by the banks ability to adopt blockchain technology.
[Link to article](
Finally we would like to recommend the book [Handbook of Digital Currency]( This book has a wide range of chapters all concerning the topic you are writing on. Especially the second part of this book has a lot of interesting visions on cryptocurrency in an economical and financial sense written by well established names in the crypto scene.

Hello TheBitDaily,
To get a complete picture and understanding of the implications that blockchain technology brings forth, we would recommend the **Blockchain Revolution** written by Dan and Alex Tapscott. This book focusses more on the actual use cases of the blockchain technology and its potential. It also sketches a possible future across a number of industries and the they discuss the impact that the blockchain technology might have.
Another suggestion for getting a better understanding of the blockchain is the book written by Melanie Swan: **Blockchain: Blueprint for a new economy**. This book focusses more on the underlying technology of bitcoin, the blockchain. The book covers the application of blockchain in the industries where it could have the most positive impact namely: the government, software, healthcare and research sector.

Hello SzLevi98,
It is possible in theory, but it will never happen in practise. The odds of this happening are so incredibly small that people in general are able to safely ignore this risk.
A small metaphor to put it into perspective of how small this chance really is;
If you would have all the sand from every beach on Earth combined in one big bowl, and you would pick up one grain of sand from this enormous amount of sand grains, only to put it back and shuffle the sand and let another person pick a grain of sand. The odds of you two picking up the same exact grain of sand are bigger than the odds of creating the same private key twice by different computers.

Hello SilverExit,
First of all, using a seed to restore your wallet is not the only way to access your funds. If you have the private key to your wallet, you can simply import it in a wallet client. To answer your second question, most official wallets do not actually store your private keys.
We will try to give you a short explanation in regards to the process of restoring your wallet from a mnemonic seed. When generating a mnemonic seed, the words are chosen out of a combination of English words from a predefined dictionary of 2048 words (BIP39). These words are then combined with the passphrase, if you configured one for the wallet. This is done using a key stretching function, which transforms the data into a 512-bit seed. This 512-bit seed is related to your master private key thus your wallet.
To view the details of this exact process, you can check out the following [link](

At the moment there is not one specific app that will give you a clear indiciation of the current "health" of the bitcoin network.
Like user theartlav stated, it also depends on your definition of the word health. Below we have made a list of several indicators that can help you get an idea of the state the network is currently in.
-Total number of active nodes. [Link](
-Hashrate distribution. [Link](
-The amount of transactions in the memory-pool. [Link]
-Average fee amount required to ensure a swift confirmation. [Link](
-The daily amount of confirmed transactions processed by the network. [Link](

Hello joeyshamoon,
We understand the confusion on your part very well, since both the private key and the 24 word seed can be used to access your funds. What sets these two methods of accessing apart is that the mnemonic seed is actually a method of securily accessing your master private key. When the mnemonic seed of 24 words is entered into a wallet the client transforms this data into a 512 bit seed which is directly linked to your master private key. Whereas a normal private key can be created for only one public key, your mnemonic seed is linked to a master private key which in turn links to several private keys and public keys.
It is also possible to integrate a passphrase in addition to your mnemonic seed adding an extra layer of security. If you want to learn more about what exactly happens behind the scenes check out the following [link](

It could be that the wallet you expected to be loaded, was in fact wallet\_1. To resolve this issue, you can either go to "File" and then "Recently opened" and select wallet\_1 from there, or alternatively you could choose for "File" and then "Open" and then select the wallet you initially wanted to load. Restarting the Electrum client should also give you the option to select the other wallet as well. Hopefully this other wallet file was the one you needed with a full transaction history so that your problem will be solved.

Hello Vengord,
The process you are talking about is called vanitygen creation, this process allows the creation of semi customized addresses. It does this by a trial and error based brute method of deriving addresses from randomnly generated private keys. So in order to create the address you just mentioned, it will take an average computer decillions of years to generate this address. The speed of calculating addresses totally depends on your computer, check out the following table [here]( to see how many addresses your computer can calculate per second.
Unfortunately this is not possible within the Bitcoin Core wallet. Check out the original thread on [bitcointalk]( if you would like to know about this.

As GreatSock below already mentioned, a native Segwit address starts with bc1. The option Ledger gives you is actually to create a P2SH-P2WSH address which starts with a 3. This is a backwards compatible version of a SegWit address, in practice this means that the transaction is slightly bigger and has a slightly higher fee. Furthermore it also doesn't have the advantage of being capital-insensitive.

Hello mrsjuliann,
You can create a watch only address for any address you find online without having the private key. Therefore it should be highly undesirable that you can unlock these watch-only addresses, which in general would mean being able to access all funds available on the bitcoin network. Being able to do this without the accompanying private key would render the Bitcoin network unusable. As sumBTC said they are called "watch only addresses" for a reason.

One of the founding principals of cryptocurrency is that you can anonymously make transactions from one party to another. Giving a TxId to a random stranger online seems like something that should be prevented considering that principal. The TxId can lead to a stranger checking out your address and its balance. If you have an anonymous account online which cannot be traced back to your personal life it will still be relatively safe.

Hello iconiconoclasticon,
We at Anycoin Direct always recommend using the Electrum wallet if you choose to use a software wallet. This also allows you to use multisig and therefore guarantees an extra level of security. However many bitcoin users just don't have the need to secure their coins to this level. We have noticed that especially users of bitcoin who have invested smaller amounts have less need for this security. At Anycoin Direct we don't offer the option to store bitcoin via our website because we think everybody should keep their coins in their own wallet. This in order to make sure users secure their own coins and because the principal 'be your own bank' is an important concept in cryptocurrency.

Hello Jakelouiss,
The reason people are giving you strange answers is because what you are saying doesn't sound very logical. First of all you cannot send money to blockchain.com to exchange it into bitcoin. If with $$$ you mean bitcoin, then yes, you could send it to a wallet on blockchain.com. However you could also just immediately transfer it  to coinbase to exchange it into cash if that is what you mean.
We would however not recommend storing your coins on coinbase or blockchain.com, as you will not be the owner of your own private keys. It is smarter to use a wallet such as Electrum in combination with a hardware wallet like the Ledger. 
For the fees you will have to be aware that for every transaction on the bitcoin network you need to pay a miner's fee. For the fees that coinbase charges we suggest you look into this yourself.

Hello makanos26,
Just a tip to start off with, we suggest that in the future you post a clickable link. This makes it easier to reach the referenced article. 
To answer your question, it really depends on what the future will bring. It is estimated that the last bitcoin will be mined in 2140, so we have no clue what the world will look like then and if bitcoin is still relevant. However, we think you are referring to the hypothetical situation where bitcoin is still relevant and widely used. 
On this website [here]( you can find an overview of when the reward for miners will halve again and other relevant data. Around 2140 the final block will be mined and from then on miners will only receive the transaction fees on the bitcoin network. There is a lot of speculation whether this will make it profitable enough for miners to keep maintaining the bitcoin network. If the value of bitcoin keeps rising, these fees should be enough to keep mining on the bitcoin network profitable. Furthermore the costs of energy and mining equipment will play a decisive role in this hypothetical situation. 
The reason there are transaction fees are used on the bitcoin network to make it more attractive for miners to keep mining. On the following website [here]( you can find the average transaction fee per block. This can give you an insight of how in the future miners will be rewarded.

Hello brawdias,
Transaction fees are measured in satoshis, which is a denomination of bitcoin. So if you mean that the transaction fees expressed in fiat are higher when the value of bitcoin is higher you are right. When expressed in btc, however, the transaction fees depend on other factors. 
Factors that influence the transaction fees on the bitcoin network are the demand and supply of transactions. A block can have a max amount of transactions it can validate within a certain time period.  Miners prefer transactions with higher fees because it makes it more profitable to mine, so if you want your transaction to be validated immediately you should send a higher fee. You can check out the following website [here]( to get an accurate estimate of which fee you should send with your transaction.
