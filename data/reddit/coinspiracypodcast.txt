I see your point, almost as compelling as the alternative theory lying in plain sight. First we start off with the S from Satoshi next the N from Nakamoto. And what was one of the earliest spin offs of Bitcoin? Uhu LITECOIN!! Which gives us our L. Bring it all together and what does it spell? SNL.  Saturday Night Live! And who was at the top of their game on SNL when Bitcoin first came to town? None other that Andy Samberg..... Aka Satoshi Nakamoto....I rest my case

I think you're spot on, it's an amazing technology with incredible potential, yet it also bring with it the chance for history to repeat itself. No matter how new and great a technology is, people's intent with it usually tends to be the same. Always good to look back to historical events to teach us some lessons about what might be coming down the pipeline for us. 
On the gold issue, there are a number of gold back cryptos being developed which you might find interesting. One I saw today mentioned in an article is called 'Glint' and seems like a good way to deal with the impracticality of carrying real gold without the risk of the overprinting of gold backed bank notes. 
I also think Bitcoins limited supply of coins is also an elegant solution to that problem.
But while cryptos are a powerful tool that can benefit the masses by democratizing currency, no doubt there will be institutions and agencies that overreach to try to use them to control people's ability to participate in the market place. Either by blocking their known wallets address/restricting access to internet or exchanges etc. I guess that's why the conversations around privacy and centralized exchanges are so important right now. 
I definitely agree that it is a sign of things to come though, so thanks for thanks for adding to the conversation and giving me some food for thought!

This is true. But does a steel beam need to melt before it loses its structural integrity?

Hi Psyents thanks for chiming in - this is definitely something I'm interested in digging a little deeper into. I know this theory has roots all the way back to George Orwell's 1984. There's been talks of a global currency for quite some time over the years (the Phoenix in the late 80s or more recently the Amero).
I'm sure there are many people out there who share your concerns about moving away from paper money. 
What would you say are some of the benefits of paper money as it currently stands that would outweigh the risks involved moving to a digital currency?

I like to think I have an open mind, but when it comes to aliens and inter-galactic pacts, I'm going to need to see some compelling evidence. 
So what do you base your theory on?

Interesting position - do you know if there is proof by way of specific transactions that point to this kind of manipulation? I'd be interested to check it out. Also would you say this ties in to the release of futures contracts?

Touche - speaking of official propaganda, and just to keep things on track, do you have any thoughts to share on the official propoganda around Bitcoin?

If only there was some kind of block-chain based vessel tracking system in place at the time. We would all know for sure if it was fraud.
