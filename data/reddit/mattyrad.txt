That's a perfect follow up question that turns the question around. Thanks.

You can exchange fiat without difficulty because it is a bank that performs the transaction, and a bank conforms to the all the lawful critera to be classified as a bank.
Robocoin does not have the status of a bank, and in order to circumvent the volumes of banking laws, they need to carry detailed records of transaction information. Not doing so would count as money laundering and they could be shut down or even arrested. Believe me, they don't do it because they want to. But that said, I can understand the hesitation in using one.

Been there. Even when you're talking to intelligent people, it can be hard to convey the gravitas of Bitcoin. And when you're talking to unintelligent people, there's really not much hope. Nevertheless, I wouldn't blame them.... Bitcoin is as bleeding edge technology as it gets, some people just can't understand at this point in time.

The last one made me laugh out loud! If he'd put an address somewhere I'd send a little coin his way!

Right. That's essentially what I find so confusing. Even though it's not, people are willing parrot the line, "It's backed by gold!" But even that carries no significance. So what if it is backed by gold? Why is that useful? When the dollar crashes and peope *actually want to change cash for gold* how in the worldly fuck is that even feasible? You can't walk to the courthouse and ask for one dollar's-worth of gold. Even if it was true, I don't understand why people are using the argument.

This is excellent. Exactly what I was looking for, thanks!
