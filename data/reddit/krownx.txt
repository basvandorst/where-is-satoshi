Although there are many shitposts, others are pretty much worth the time and I'm glad to find people like you..

Don't know if you are the true author of this or not.. In any case, this is my opinion:


The reason why we "want things, titles and positions" is because they represent power. What can I do with power? I can force someone to do my bidding. And unity is strength. People who think in the long run versus people who think in the short run, for example. 
Unfortunately for others, but fortunately for us, we have the capacity to think. My goals might not be the same as yours, and so, I shouldn't comply to your demands if I don't wish to do so. Education is capable of freeing ourselves. We need arts as much as we need maths. Education for knowing how to maneuver the present, and also to open up a path to the future. How? I'm not sure.
But society will not stop looking for power, as long as it exists. Is it fair to provide each individual with the same amount of power? That sounds unwise, because some people work harder than others. Is it fair to keep the power in only one entity/institution? Absolutely not, because other people are forced against their will.
Now, is it fair to compete for power? Totally, but we should understand that nowadays competition is absolutely skewed. And money and resources are the ones that incline the scale.
I wish to believe we can reach an equitable society, able to provide different opportunities to everyone, according to the resources they have. One of the most important aspects here is cheap energy.
But as long as resources are translated to strength, even when most people disagree with your philosophy and goals, the world will not meet a "perfect" civilization.

It's not that I believe that will happen. I hope it doesn't, but without going too far I see that people band together in groups according to their own beliefs, ideas and tastes. If my group's ideals are completely opposite to yours, then a problem surfaces. To solve it, you can cooperate, or fight to prove us wrong. Cooperation or conflict. I wish it wasn't that binary but it is.
As for the space thingy, don't count me in.. If on earth we can't work together, I see very unlikely that "expanding" our territory would be any different.
