Edit: Spelling
@_date: 2016-08-19 06:32:55
I want this. Sell these so I can buy one, or maybe 2.
@_date: 2016-08-16 21:21:51
Unless you go through the verification process and whatnot and up your instant buy limits. That's what I did.

This is amazing! Merry Christmas!

Care to elaborate? I'm just phishing for all the info and opinions I can find. :)

If you're interested in stuff like that check out my [buddy's website]( hes got tons of infographics with really cool info relating to this.

[The Legal Docs]( are a pretty interesting read for anyone interested. 
My favorite part of the document: 
"Defendants also paid for positive commentary on their marketing materials to
generate additional hype for the offering. In September 2017, for example, Sharma texted
Trapani and Farkas: “When one of you guys wake up plz boost our video. Buy likes comments.
The most we can Let’s get it pumping.” Farkas responded that he was “[o]n it,” and later
boasted that his efforts had “[b]oosted the f[***] out of it.”"

That's asking a lot for most people.

As a miner, trader, and crypto enthusiast I look forward to seeing Joe's reactions to Bitcoin in this episode. Haven't listened yet but will soon.

Jesus Fucking Christ! Somebody, anybody give me a reason hate CZ and Binance. BNB ^
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:45:18
He's probably reffering to [THIS ARTICLE]( regarding the fake volume. I suggest reading the entire article and coming to your own conclusion as to whether or not this is a valid reason to dislike Binance. Regarding CZ being "Shady AF and anyone that has been around since before 2015 knows that"- no idea. I've been around the crypto scene since October 2012 and have been a Binance user since November 2017 and have never had a single issue outside of the exchange running slowly at times. Every issue I've seen Binance/CZ face they have handled thoroughly and with transparently to the community at hand. Maybe I missed something though? I too would be interested in a follow up comment for further explanation as to why CZ is "shady af". Regarding not leaving anything on Binance you're not actively trading... this is common knowledge across the crypto space and goes for any/all exchanges.

Anyone on here using BTC-e to day trade? I know a lot of people say don't get into day trading but I enjoy it and its really helping me understand the day to day fluctuations in great detail. A friend of mine threw me .01 BTC in my BTC-e account and I've been trading with it for the past week or so.  Trading LTC-USD, BTC-USD, BTC-LTC, etc. I'm thinking of purchasing a couple of Bitcoins on Coinbase and transferring them over to BTC-e to trade with. Has anyone had experience working with Coinbase to BTC-e and vice versa? I'm just wondering if anyone has had any experience sending money out of their BTC-e account into coinbase, and eventually back into their bank account (Chase Bank in my case). Any info would be great. Thanks!
