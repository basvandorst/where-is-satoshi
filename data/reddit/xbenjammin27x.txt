They were allowing basic accounts to withdraw, then changed it to 0.

Thanks for the non-helpful reply but that was just the most recent ticket I sent in, ya know after weeks of not being able to withdraw, it kind of bugs me.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:00:43
Right? Without even a response from the company, it's very troublesome.

They allow me to deposit money, then not allow me to take it back. 1,000s of other users having the same issue. If you take something and won't give it back that's my definition of stealing. This seems to be a widespread issue.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:04:56
Thank your for this, I've personally seen 1,000s of these because I've been combing the internet for weeks about it.
They are disabling people's accounts who were already verified, not verifying people, letting them deposit and not withdraw. MAJOR PROBLEMS.

Hey thanks, I haven't really seen other have the same positive result. I've seen people's accounts become disabled overnight for no reason, it's worrying me. I haven't looked there, I'm not very familiar with Reddit but I'll check it out.

Thank you very much, it's been very stressful. It hurts my perception of crypto and exchanges. This is a surefire way to lose any trust they may have gained. Some people have had the issue for months.

I've done both the Basic verification and the Enhanced. Don't also discount the people who had enhanced verifications and had their accounts disabled and verifications removed.
They wouldn't accept my Enhanced verification even though I used my License ID and same name. This is going on a month now

Look on the Bittrex twitter posts, 1,000s of comments of ppl saying the same thing, in addition to all the Reddit posts
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:59:08
Exactly.. Like you can give them money but not take it back, TERRIBLE business practice.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:03:25
Exactly, All the people telling me it's my fault that they won't give me my own money are completely wrong. Imagine a bank not letting you withdraw your own money.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:17:08
The question is why is an exchange allowing money to be deposited but not withdrawn? This was the only exchange I had an issue with.
And you don't understand the scope of the issue. People's accounts who were already verified were disabled with the same "name mismatch" error and removed their ability to withdraw. This is not the situation I'm in but it points to a larger picture.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:08:15
It's their fault, they should either not allow deposits without verification, or let me redo the verification process and not just lock the account after a single attempt.
Binance allowed me to deposit AND withdraw. This is a very large spread issue
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:27:45
It's located in the USA, where I live.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:29:33
Yup! Some people think I'm lying when I say they're removing verifications and disabling accounts.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:31:23
Well when you set up a bad automated verification system that doesn't work and doesn't allow you to resubmit, but lets you deposit and not withdraw, the support tickets are going to fly in by the 1,000s..
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:02:10
How can I be at fault for a company taking my money and not giving it back, while using a "name mismatch" EXCUSE. My name is the same on my Drivers License, and they won't even let me resubmit the documentation, it just locked.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:09:15
But the issue is, why are 1,000s of people having the same "name mismatch" error? This isn't about being understaffed when they have an automatic verification system that doesn't require employees. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:59:35
Yup! Granted I'm new but how can you let someone deposit money but not get it back?
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:23:39
Yes, many times. You can look at the post by  on Twitter that says "We have turned off user registration for a DB upgrade due to a large spike in new user sign ups."
My post there has over 200 likes and over 15 re-tweets,  a ton of people having the same issue.
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:06:52
From that post.

No it did not. They replied and said that they are not qualified to verify because it is not their job. So they have forwarded it to the proper team. That was 3 days ago."
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:57:46
exactly, they are just disabling people's accounts with the "name mismatch" excuse. It's ridiculous
