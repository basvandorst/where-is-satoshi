How do you know, then? All the available data, including the charts that *you* posted, show that the growth is **not** exponential. This holds true whether you take a 5-year period, or pretty much any 1-year (annual) period you care to define in Bitcoin's history. Show me a year that had exponential growth or gtfo.
@_date: 2014-11-30 16:30:38
I hate to be a detractor, but incremental != exponential. Frankeh is right that exponential means something very specific, and bitcoin's growth this year, while positive, hasn't been exponential.

Changed nodes that run differently are fine, and it is absolutely LukeJr's right to develop and promote these. This should be done as a fork.
As the Gentoo maintainer of the official bitcoind or bitcoin-core software, the *only* changes he should be making, *if any* are ones that are *necessary* to get the software working on Gentoo. Anything more than that - such as the filtering he's implemented again, should only be included in a separate fork, e.g. bitcoind-lukejr.

Agreed - he either needs to send the change upstream (where it will be rejected) or make his own fork.

@_date: 2014-09-12 09:21:53
It has to be this. At the moment, most retailers immediately cash out. This means, counter-intuitively, that more adoption will create more sell pressure, driving the price down. At least in the short term.
In the long term, once we reach a critical mass of adoption, retailers will begin to trade their BTC with each other directly, pay their employees, pay their suppliers, and maybe even hodl themselves. This is when the price will go to the moon.

Yes, the government will still get money from tax - bitcoin won't change that. What bitcoin changes is a governement's ability to arbitrarily print as much money as it wants to fund its wars. Taxes alone wouldn't come close to covering the cost of modern wars. They are funded by money-printing (i.e. debt creation).
@_date: 2014-11-16 10:15:51
This is why we need bitcoin capabilities on merchant POS devices. They can be (usually are) hard-wired into the Internet via Ethernet, so the transaction can be signed by the customer via NFC, then broadcast by the merchant, who should have Internet access all the time.
WiFi is not necessary.

Nothing really, there are just other priorities right now. There's no reason it can't be as simple as you desire - it's just packaging, but there's no point until it's in a state that's more ready for mainstream use.
The people they want testing it right now are the sort of people who have no trouble with the command-line stuff.
@_date: 2014-11-30 23:32:17
This is the future. Offline NFC transactions are the way to go. Let the merchant handle the transaction broadcast and verification via the blockchain. All your phone needs to do is sign the transaction with a private key and transmit that signature (transaction) to the merchant somehow. There's no reason to involve the Internet in that part of the process.
@_date: 2014-11-21 14:01:23
Some great ideas in here. However, I don't think a MAC address blacklist is the way to go.
You seem to be suggesting that anyone who obtains data and then doesn't pay their bill should have their MAC uploaded to a distributed list for a while, as should anyone who takes payment and doesn't deliver the data. While this could work, I think it should be much more instantaneous than that. There should be some way to link payment to packet delivery automatically.
@_date: 2014-12-20 13:20:54
Yes, I believe this is the reason for the price drop. Loads of merchants have started accepting, and most of the volume is immediately cashed out to fiat. This has to be putting a massive downward pressure on the price. I still don't think it's necessarily a bad thing, though.
Here's my prediction: As more and more merchants start accepting, the price will continue to fall, until adoption reaches a "critical mass". Once enough businesses accept bitcoin, suddenly businesses will realise that if they keep more of their income in bitcoin rather than converting to fiat, they can *use* it to pay their bills and suppliers, since they accept bitcoin too. The loops will begin to close and less and less BTC will be cashed out to fiat, causing the downward pressure to subside and the price to begin to rise again.
Coupled with increased consumer adoption, that will be the begining of Gentlemen ;)

Oh come on, how hard is it to put up a QR code? Or even an NFC terminal? Bitcoin newbies don't have to use it - I'm not saying *replace* traditional payment methods like cards and cash with bitcoin overnight, but at least if B&amp;M stores can offer it as an *option*, it makes bitcoin actually useful in the real world, where most transactions still take place.
Also, bitcoin can usually be processed faster than a card payment. 10 minute confirmation is totally unnecessary for the vast majority of transactions. Only very high value transactions would require that level of security, and even then, it's pretty unlikely that anyone is going to be able to execute a double-spend, which would require extraordinary skills, coordination, collaboration, and luck. Not to mention the hashpower required, as well as a custom-coded wallet. It's possible, just extremely unlikely. Much less likely than credit card fraud, actually.

I agree this is a problem in developed countries, but specifically in the case of developing countries where people are the recipients of remittances from abroad, there's a very strong motive for them to use bitcoin directly without converting it, but unfortunately there's currently nowhere for them to spend it.
If all their local merchants accepted bitcoin, then they could save a ton on remittances because their relatives abroad could send them money fee-free that they could then spend directly.
The problem at the moment is that there's no motive for merchants to accept it. If there were local money-changers set up who would buy bitcoin for local currency, even if they only handled larger amounts, the merchants could "cash in" the bitcoins they've taken in their stores easily. Eventually, as more and more of the economy starts accepting bitcoin (because it can always be "easily" changed into local currency), the motive to cash out of bitcoin is reduced and people just start paying each other with it directly. But that can be a gradual thing.

There is no "they". No-one runs bitcoin. Your statement is like saying "I thought it went against what cash stands for".
Also, bitcoin is not always anonymous. In fact, every transaction is recorded and public, but you don't necessarily have to tie your name to the transaction, so it is pseudonymous and potentially anonymous if used a certain way.
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:09:14
So I suppose what *really* needs to happen is for merchants in developing countries to realise the value of bitcoin and accept it in transactions for goods and services. This would mean that recipients of remittance via bitcoin wouldn't have to convert to fiat as they would be able to spend their bitcoin directly.
So how do we enable this? Well, ideally the businesses can pay their wholesalers in bitcoin, pass it down the chain, yada yada, but in the short term I think the most vital thing is going to be money-changing shops being set up in these developing countries that can exchange "medium" amounts of money for the businesses that accept bitcoin. Some kind of physical bitcoin bureau-de-change. Is anyone doing this now?

More merchant adoption will, for now, push *down* prices, as they mostly convert straight to fiat, putting sell (i.e. downward) pressure on the price.
The remedy to this is increased consumer adoption, which mostly means more *buy* (i.e. upward) pressure.
However, there will eventually come a point where enough merchants accept bitcoin that it becomes logical for them to pay each other with it (and by that I mean their suppliers, employees, etc.). I believe this is when we'll reach a "critical mass" of adoption, and bitcoin will finally have "done it".

This isn't *strictly* true. Heat is a type of energy, and energy cannot be created or destroyed, only converted. For example, when hydro electric energy is used to mine bitcoin, most of the energy is given off in heat, and some is used to physically move around electrons in the transistors that make up a computer processor. The efficiency of the chip determines how much of the input energy ends up as heat and how much is used to do computation.
My main point here, however, is that climate change isn't caused by heat being produced on Earth. It's caused by CO2 emissions which trap heat from the sun, preventing it from escaping. CO2 acts like a kind of blanket around the Earth, warming it up. Adding a bit of extra heat from Bitcoin mining really doesn't make any difference, so long as carbon isn't burned to produce that energy. The reason that excessive energy use is seen as a bad thing is that in general energy is generated by burning carbon and producing CO2, which leads to global warming.
For this reason, the focus needs to be on encouraging the use of *renewable* energy, rather than burning fossil fuels. If we can achieve this, it doesn't really matter how much heat we produce as nothing we do can have a noticeable impact relative to the affect of CO2 pollution.

When I load up my phone with btc, who has the keys? This is pretty crucial really, as I try to decide whether this is something truly new, or just another xapo-style debit card.

@_date: 2015-11-14 10:53:09

Generally I agree with you, but sometimes I do wonder about this. For example, say someone was to build a sort-of standard template for a website, and package it with a specialized version of apache or nginx. This website allows you to list products for sale, along with a bitcoin address for payment.
All of this is packaged together into an easy-to-use installer that anyone can run.
Isn't this basically openbazaar? It's peer-to-peer because people will be connecting to your web server directly. It has bitcoin payment. It's as uncensorable as openbazaar.
I know there's more to it than this. You need some smart-contract stuff to make sure that no-one gets scammed. Is this where the majority of OB's work happens, and therefore where the value comes from?
I guess there's also an element of listing/indexing to it, but that seems like something a separate service could accomplish, c.f. Pirate Bay not actually being part of bittorrent.

Yay! I now live within 100 miles of a bitcoin ATM.
Now if only they would open one in Carmarthen...

That makes sense. TIL.

That's pretty cool. Some follow-up questions if I may:
* Once I've loaded up the smart contract with some btc, who has keys to that? Under what circumstances can the buyers withdraw the btc?
* When I make a transaction at an NFC terminal, is that what releases funds to the buyer?
* If so, does that mean the smart contract, or my phone, needs to keep track of bid prices in advance so that it's ready to go when I make a transaction?
* Is the smart contract designed in such a way that I have the necessary keys to withdraw my btc from it at any time, without anyone else's permission?

But those guys wouldn't have *been* money launderers if it wasn't for said police.

What improvements have you made re: encryption? Do you at least encrypt the CC numbers now? If so, how?

I love bitcoin because it's the best defense we have against corrupt banks stealing our money through enless inflation.
We can't destroy banks, but we can innovate around them to make them redundant!

Just buy more BTC to replace the amount you spent on a burger.
Eventually, people will earn BTC in the first place, so this question will become irrelevant, but in the meantime replenishing is the way to go imo.
