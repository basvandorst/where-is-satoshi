My professional option as a moneyconimist is anywhere from onefinity to fourfinity megaeuros per bitdollar. The sky is the limit. I wouldn't even think of exiting until then.

To be a bit coin billionaire, you'd currently have to hold about 4 million btc, or about 36% of all the bitcoins in existence.

I'm not a tax professional in any way, but I definitely wouldn't take tax advice from the equivalent of yahoo answers. 
If you take short/long term losses outweighing your gains, there would be no reason why you couldn't deduct the losses. Unless there's some random tax law about bitcoins, which I find hard to believe would exist. 
There are limits, $3000 afaik, but bitcoins don't get some special treatment.
And obviously the gains would be subject to taxes. It would be silly to think they wouldn't be.
