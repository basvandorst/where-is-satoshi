There's nothing preventing them from already filling 1mb blocks with junk, and that's not happening. Why would that change with 20mb blocks?

I agree that kicking the can down the road is not sufficient. The time when we would need to up the max block size again will definitely creep up sooner than we think. An algorithmic solution such as the one Karpeles mentioned is preferable.

So basically you take the worst case scenario for an ad and then justify entirely removing all ads from your experience and thus punishing every other website you visit because you found that one ad annoying.  And then I suppose you trod away on your high horse. And "acceptable ads" is another word for racketeering, but when you put it like that I guess it makes you feel better about being a self-serving lowlife with zero respect for the people producing the content you consume.

Gengis Khan. The Roman Empire. Napoleonic Wars. The hundred Years war (literally lasted 100 years).

It's like littering. Of course it doesn't change anything if you don't throw your shit on the floor, because it's not like you can clean up the whole city right guys?????

So the problem isn't paypal or credit cards, it's the existence of Israel.

This is an illiterate interpretation of a common licensing clause that lets companies actually use the content you send them so they can display it on their webpages. This is typically what happens when somebody reads any EULA for the first time ever and gasps and jumps at the big scary words.

Fairly impressive but the fact you never saw another human being face to face during the whole process is a bit depressing... There's something nice about being greeted by a human being and knowing somebody's around in case of things.

Why? Are you assuming I'm not familiar with the notion? I am. So what?
@_date: 2015-04-27 07:27:23
AdBlock already accepts "donations" from websites to unblock their ads. Everything about AdBlock is sleazy and dishonest, maybe try donating to people that actually need the help?

So do people not litter because they might get fined or because they are civilised and understand why they should not litter in the first place?
@_date: 2015-04-27 08:46:31
Cue 90% of users who don't bother doing that let alone even know about it.
Let alone the fact using Adblock in the first place is not really justifiable, if you don't like a website, don't visit it and that's it right guys??? oh no but we are entitled to everything on the Internet, why should we respect content creators, fuck what is often their sole way to make income, i can't be fucked to look at a banner for two seconds, my comfort is more important than respecting the people that produce and publish the content i am enjoying

I'm not getting angry, I'm really asking! Your comment sounded condescending really. "I suggest you google this" ok professor! Any reason you are assuming I don't know something you do?

It doesn't seem to me that any website brags about underage people accessing them when they shouldn't... Only Ross seems to be proud of that

AND it would also enable revenue for the producers of the content creators whose work you consume, but of course you conveniently ignore that because you don't care about anything else than your perceived comfort, which is the whole problem. No amount of regulations and rules is going to change you being an ungrateful self-serving ass with blinders. But I'm tired of repeating myself. See ya

sources or the analysts in your head?

No see, that's just a way for you to reject the responsibility for your actions on some greater necessary social phenomenon. You are inverting cause and effect in a bid to present yourself as some sort of victim when you are the one defrauding publishers and content creators.
One way to avoid this "tragedy" would be for you and your friends to stop acting like entitled sleazy dickheads, but of course it's easier for you to just blame some abstract concept and social phenomenon rather than just own up to what you are doing.
You can kick and scream and whine all you want but the reality is that you are the one responsible for this and no amount of finger pointing will change anything. Nobody forced you to install Adblock. The god of the tragedy of commons did not issue any order to you.

True, there were hardly any wars before the introduction of fiat money. The era of gold corresponded to unequalled peace and prosperity. Are you high?
