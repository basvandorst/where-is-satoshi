how vulnerable is the PPA?
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:58:17
Note in that blog post the promotion is blockchains, not Bitcoin. This is what the OP is concerned about. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:47:30
This is why miners mine SPV blocks. Furthermore, we've never seen that attack before and aren't likely to. F2pool doesn't count because they were altruistically cleaning up the UTXO set. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:02:43
most of those don't work for Blockstream
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:50:19
Headers first mining as proposed by Gavin &amp; Sergio. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 19:57:11
Unlimited doesn't rely on altruism. In fact, it relies on greed, as it should. 
In headfirst mining, if an attacker doesn't send headers first, he's just increased his chances of orphaning.

Fact is, Swanson really is an idiot. 
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:38:47
what do you think "first" means in the context of "headersfirst"?  it means verification of a block of tx's come "second".
@_date: 2016-08-30 13:31:10
Now imagine if you were only allowed to do 3TPD (tx's per day) because the core president of the island deemed that the law. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 17:41:20
My question had to do with the fact that pc's never have to be closed due to their bilateral directionality.  I've seen Adam tout this as a big advantage.  Thus, if the pc never has to settle back onchain and since coins can hop around to different altchains, why should they ever do so?
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:46:01
maybe we wouldn't need miners at all in a LN hub or federated server model sidechain world?
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:48:18
A Bitcoin fork would turn out much differently. 
@_date: 2016-08-23 13:48:58
Testing? 
@_date: 2016-08-20 05:26:50
well, if they'd lift or ideally eliminate the limit, maybe it could achieve that status.
@_date: 2016-08-22 17:02:21
yeah, i agree with this.  good advice.
@_date: 2016-08-29 20:14:57
headfirst miners still do verify tx's and thus chains.
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:31:22
Wouldn't the different time preference, as you call it, be neutralized by LN lower tx fees?
@_date: 2016-08-29 18:52:29
No, because your vision of Bitcoin is just going to die on the vine from lack of users. 
@_date: 2016-08-19 22:20:34
What do you expect a bull market to do? Go up in a straight line just so you can make money? 
@_date: 2016-08-30 02:04:55
you don't understand Gavin's proposal.  go read it.
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:09:58
don't mistake inertia for support of the status quo.
@_date: 2016-08-16 15:53:46
Why would that be so when CSV makes closing a channel unnecessary?  In essence BTC could disappear into LN forever without returning onchain to make fees for miners? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 14:27:59
How are miners supposed to make any money long term with both LN &amp; federated SC's competing for fees? 
@_date: 2016-08-16 16:10:08
but that wouldn't distinguish them from any other 'ol kid who can spin up a LN hub.  merge mining as well could cause all BTC to move over to a SC permanently according WP, iirc.
@_date: 2016-08-21 23:16:28
Bitcoin itself is trustless but if you're going to run a sidechain, at least today, it requires a federated server to trust. 
@_date: 2016-08-30 12:00:20
Do you understand Bitcoin? The header has to satisfy the target difficulty. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:09:09
there's quite a bit of cushion for users to run home full nodes even with a blocksize increase.
@_date: 2016-08-29 09:51:48
Like you would know 
@_date: 2016-11-28 03:28:04
the 1MB cap is what has led to mining centralization, can't you see?  allowing the mining pie revenue to grow thru a blocksize increase will allow mining to decentralize around the world.  miners have made huge fiat investments into ASIC HW, which is way more than any core devs have ever made.  they secure Bitcoin thru the unique electricity driven POW mechanism which no state actor can undermine or hack except thru a huge costly gamble, which they won't make and can't achieve.  
i'm glad to hear you say there will be no compromise. it makes it clear which path we have to take.
@_date: 2016-11-21 19:12:21
it is good, huh? :)
@_date: 2016-11-28 03:38:25
no, none of us should ever accept being anything other than a SW full node so that we can independently verify all signatures from the genesis block (checkpoints are to be phased out) and serve them up along with the entire blockchain to any other new bootstrapping full node.  this is a basic tenet of this sub and should be inviolable.  unfortunately i won't save on any validation, transmission, or storage space as was advertised.
@_date: 2016-11-28 04:59:39






lame response. go study.
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:35:36


SW starves miners of fee income b/c it causes persistence of the 1MB cap which amounts to ~2000 tx's per block which means fees would have to significantly increase to compensate for lost reward income as the halvings continue years out.  Miners must be allowed to make this revenue income up thru tx volume.  Miners are first and foremost when it comes to Bitcoin security b/c of the necessary POW function which makes them unique stewards of the economy which prevents attack by TPTB.  OP talks of willy nilly increases in blocksize.  lol, big block proponents have compromised down from 20 to 8 to 2MB w/o one inch of compromise from Core over the last 3y of debate.  Now suddenly they want to call this a SWSF failure to adopt a "blocking" by big block proponents when they've been doing nothing but blocking for those several years.
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:25:14
i don't think you understand Bitcoin and it's security model.
@_date: 2016-09-03 22:47:05
Yes, Mr Tom Williams. 
@_date: 2016-09-03 22:57:42
The funniest part was watching Phinnaeus Gage try to link Stefan Thomas to Tom Williams. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 10:33:14
Not sure about that as they seemed to pivot away from Bitcoin somewhat over the last year due to the lack of scaling. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 10:59:43
Isn't it odd though that BTC.com would be routing so many of its blocks suddenly through one VPS node? If should be more random. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 14:49:12
Trust me, it goes way beyond that. 
@_date: 2016-09-08 19:24:18
in aggregate, altcoins simply have to attract away the interest from Bitcoin to do damage.
@_date: 2016-09-07 22:57:11
nice talking to you.
@_date: 2016-09-07 23:12:48
thx for supplying that.  i'd forgotten about that exact tweet but remembered something very concrete about why i thought he was getting pessimistic about the current situation.
@_date: 2016-09-03 04:48:32
Isn't that what offchain solutions are doing? 
@_date: 2016-09-06 00:54:45
It sounds like you generated that paper backup from Armory itself in which case it doesn't display an ordinary Bitcoin private key. It's probably in root key and/or chain code format which looks like 2 rows of 4 letter sets, 9 sets per row. You have to import those directly back into Armory to access. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 17:48:06
i said it appears to me that they are "somewhat" pivoting away from Bitcoin.  that's my take from your article.
@_date: 2016-09-07 18:09:53
"That's not going to scale and not going to work. The fundamental aspects of the architecture will need to scale."
@_date: 2016-09-10 21:17:39
"that light bulb moment" 
@_date: 2016-09-10 16:46:12
the trick is in the premium of course and off loading them quickly. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 23:50:26
Easy.   Just reload into Armory and send to CB.

@_date: 2016-09-04 04:15:02
Stop hyperventilating. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 16:13:37
from the article linked above:
"That's not going to scale and not going to work. The fundamental aspects of the architecture will need to scale."
"However, he notably used governance as a broad term, extending beyond government enforcement to encompass the steps the community at large will need to make to ensure consumers can use bitcoin."

There are always speculators who want to try and pick a bottom even with currencies. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 18:45:21
you can parse that the way you like but my read on that, along with what a poster said above about them hiding the BTC button on their site, is that he seems to be indicating a particular skepticism that maybe Bitcoin will not be allowed to scale to the degree it needs to achieve widespread acceptance.
