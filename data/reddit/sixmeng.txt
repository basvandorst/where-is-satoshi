Some mornings I walk into a shop to buy a snack w/e, I go to pay the assistant and they say "would you like a free copy of The Sun?" , it's rather quite insulting &gt;.&lt;

for those that need help understanding, the photo is from trust pilot of a actual shill in it's natural habitat. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:23:16
This was never a cool sub, ffs whats cool about bitcoin? it's a way of life not a fad. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:17:35

@_date: 2018-01-15 22:26:59
the shill is in the photo! how can you be so blind to see that? you are the shill for attacking me when I blatantly posted some other stupid shill. ffs, I mean really.

Learn to accept different cultures, not everyone speaks the way you want it. Do you think 5 stars are also acceptable?, it's just the same on the opposite end. Ignorance is bliss...

And I yelled, I said “What do you want from us monster?!”
And the monster bent down and said “I need about treefiddy.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:59:58
I understand it could be unclear to some, as I noticed from a couple replies lol. Southern Englishman speaks in a way that , when calling someone out we call them a wank bag :) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:46:05
oh that solves everything then, case closed...
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:38:24
lol, let's not forget this gem "This company is awesome. They have a lot of great information regarding the difference between Bitcoin BTC and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). I use their wallet all the time. The reason there are so many bad reviews is a lot of people are attempting to crush Bitcoin Cash and stop it from growing. Read up on the bitcoin scaling debate to understand the controversy. I am a bitcoin cash supporter, check out the YouTube artist "Decentralized Thought", he has a lot of great YouTube videos explaining why Bitcoin Cash is better."

haha you special person, it was you wasn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:13:01
Bitcoin is not a company, it's an open source project. Shills gonna shill...sake

I've done my part. Have you?
@_date: 2018-09-18 08:13:45
In the episode Krusty lost it all on the bitcoin markets, this was before it reached to the recent ATH's of last year. So it's a bit of FUD and price related lol. When Bitcoin gets mentioned on something as mainstream as The Simpsons, expect the community to know about something like that as it happens ;)
@_date: 2018-09-19 08:03:56
Haha i'm not! Just don't get upset by an indirect insult! Lot's of worse things to get upset about, have reddit gold.
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:46:19
Yeh , messed up with the title. I did change the link  bitcoin com/info/what-is-bitcoin-ca"" though. whoops lol.
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:22:25
Just a heads up on this. Bitcoin dot con are  trying to make users remove their reviews from upto 6 months or more ago by using the in system report option. By doing this they have set off the streisand effect as they have now gained close to 100 extra negative reviews on Trustpilot.
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:59:12
A good idea for those affected by this. Report the blatantly fake reviews as fake.
@_date: 2018-08-06 18:16:24
r/btc are now using this as r/bitcoin abusing Trustpilot , ignoring the fact that it was BITCOIN dot CON that are the ones trying to remove the reviews, that is censorship right?

You'll notice that "commission" is quite common for us in the UK. It's roughly the same on coinbase, localbitcoins etc

Amazon accepting bitcoin is like MTGOX accepting litecoin, to like Wallmart accepting doge and banks accepting satoshi dust for food stamps. Wait until the tech works for you, just like the internet did for company's like Amazon or eBay(pay-pal).

Why was my experience misinformation? It actually happened regardless of me reading the T&amp;C or not. I'm still aloud to say they suck though :S. CFD's suck, eToro sucks. sake lol
@_date: 2015-09-25 05:58:18
What is all the fuss about. I bought a sub 2 months ago with bitcoin so I could get some 360 vids? :S
@_date: 2018-07-23 10:27:49
eTORO suck. Signed up with them back in 2014/15 and received $5 free credit. I used that free credit to invest in Bitcoin which was just recently introduced to the platform. I left it and forgot about it till last last year when I decided to log in to take a looksie. It was removed from my account because the free credit period had ended. What BS lol
@_date: 2018-07-06 15:01:50

"hai! I have bitcoin, please come in..."
@_date: 2016-07-23 06:11:02
This happened to me yesterday. I sent a ticket but I'm still waiting for a reply (lol). I used bittylicious instead.
@_date: 2015-02-28 11:31:37
Shame you don't have any bitcoin stickers to stick on that notice!
