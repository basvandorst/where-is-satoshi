One of the main selling points of using bitcoin is that you don't have to trust anyone but yourself to keep your value protected. 
You are doing the exact opposite of that by giving an anonymously owned company possesion of your money.
Personally I keep a small amount on BTC-e for trading but it's a single digit percentage of my total BTC.
But do as you like, just know you are taking an unneccessary risk in doing so.

So essentially you're saying it wants to be a decentralised Silk Road but fails to achieve it. I didn't think that was its aim.
Granted there's nothing on OpenBazaar right now that I want to buy (less than a day after launch mind you), but I could see a future where sellers pass some of their savings from the reduced fees on to their customers. That could entice people to start using it, maybe just for large purchases at first (like second hand cars for example) if it means a 5% or so saving.

What about a third party that holds 1 of 3 keys in a 2/3 multi-sig wallet with 2 factor verification and white lists transactions below certain amounts within a given timeframe.
In this scenario the third party would have no custody over your funds but would have the ability to block transactions should they suspect fraud.
You would still have the convenience of a credit card for small amounts and ultimately the funds are under your control with 2/3 keys in your possession. One of which would be kept physically secured.
@_date: 2016-04-05 20:53:14
I don't follow the development of OpenBazaar that closely, but I recall reading that in the future they intend on working out a way of distributing store pages across other servers so that yours wouldn't necessarily have to be online 24/7.

I'm conflicted, I've heard it's fairly useless to run a full node unless you're using it to verify your own transactions.
I own a ledger and whilst I believe I could use electrum to point to my node, I'd much rather just use ledger's own software which sadly doesn't allow me to point to it at this time.
Also does anyone know if it's a requirement to run a full node to run a lightning node or can you just point to someone else's if you so desired?

They have partnered with Coinbase and Bitstamp so are in fact purchasing BTC, ETH &amp; LTC for you, they just don't allow you to withdraw it to your own wallet most likely for KYC/AML reasons.
Considering all you need is a phone number to get a bank account with them I think that's fair enough for now.

That's a bit of a blanket statement. I would say most of my friends would be totally for something that subverts government control. Especially given the conservative surveillance government we have at the moment.
Regardless I wouldn't really say that Bitcoin challenges the British Government's power or ever will for that matter. It challenges the banks' power, which I'm sure most governments have had enough of, hence why Chancellor Osborne has been all for financial innovation and thus competition in the sector.

If you want people to get in to Bitcoin then that's the way I think you go about it. Don't try and 'sell' it to them because then they'll think there's some kind of catch.
Just give people the plain facts and point them in the direction to more technical info should they be curious enough to pursue it, too much information and they wont be able to take it all in at once. Fuck it took me practically a year to wrap my head around it.
Also, telling them 'it's the next big thing, it's going to change the world, stop wars, fuck the bankers' etc. will probably make their eyes roll.

Have you considered handing out more than 1000 bits per person? I'm sure they would be more likely to bring it up in conversation with friends afterwards if you gave them enough to purchase something and provide them with a list of places to spend it nearby.

I don't even know why this is an argument. Bits sounds catchier and is more memorable. Just because a few people in the community can't let go of mBTC and uBTC doesn't mean we should listen to them.
Personally though if I had it my way I'd have bits be 10^-3 , Satoshis 10^-6 and then in the distant future use 10^-8 as 1 cent of a Satoshi. (Implying by that point 1 BTC will be worth huge amounts and cents will no longer be synonymous with $$$.)

I don't see how it's a single point of failure. Speculation and hoarding is what got bitcoin to where it is today and is what's still holding the price up. Just look what happened with the bearwhale, someone sold a massive amount of BTC, the speculators responded and the makret recovered. Think about it, all the bearwhale's bitcoins just got distributed amongst thousands of people, which is great. Give it time and it'll keep on happening.
If it didn't show such massive speculative gains last year because of people buying it up then no one other than nerds would still be interested. That means no venture capitalists, merchants or mainstream media coverage like we're seeing now.
Also, contrary to what the guy in the video said, the price is important when it comes to the utility of the currency and it still needs to be a lot higher to be liquid enough for a global market. So frankly I'm keeping my savings in BTC for many more years to come.

In the context of Bitcoin perhaps, but I don't think it's that hard to comprehend the general difference between the two when explained.
To try to put it simply for Privacy - Doing something out of sight that only those who have permission can see. Although others may be aware of what you're doing, they can't see it (e.g. Voting booths).
Anonymity - Doing something that anyone can see without giving away your real identity (e.g. Mask wearing protesters).
@_date: 2014-10-06 13:03:58
Of course, but a lower price means fewer miners meaning less $$$ spent on hardware and so less BTC needed to be sold to recoup those losses.
@_date: 2014-08-01 12:42:22
OK, but just having a lot of money isn't enough to start conflicts, you need men to fight for you and they need a cause. As well as that I highly doubt any big holders of BTC are government officials or army generals.
Also, say someone did manage to spend 1000 BTC and convince an army to fight for them. What happens once they've depleted that 1000 BTC? i.e How would you go about acquiring more money to keep paying the soldiers? Today's easiest solution of printing more would be obsolete.
Like I said, it won't stop conflicts entirely, but it will stop countries going in to wars that they can't afford but do so anyway at the expense of its citizens, since they are always the ones to suffer the brunt of the economic cost.

Nothing, except that you would make more money by just complying with the network by spending that computing power mining Bitcoin instead.
Unless you're an anarchist millionaire who has the funds available to make an attempt at a collision and just want to see Bitcoin burn then there is really no reason to try to do so, and even if you did your chances are almost 0. I suspect some people have already tried, yet none have succeeded.

Doesn't surprise me at all really. It's not exactly a smooth experience purchasing bitcoin in the U.K as it stands. Yes there are sites like localbitcoins, but you are forced in to paying above market prices and it isn't a very quick process. I do expect that to improve in the coming months when we get a real GBP exchange with decent volume.
Add on to that the banking system here has quick and free transfers, contactless payments and uses a stable currency. People here just don't have many reasons to want to leave that system for something as unestablished as Bitcoin. Anyone who does own bitcoin in the U.K must see it as a risky profit making opportunity and/or is passionate about the technology.

No you cannot, not unless there has already been transactions made to that address that are on the blockchain.

Bitcoin mining is no longer profitable using any other hardware device than an ASIC (Application Specific Integrated Circuit) and even then it's no guarentee.
As the name implies, these devices are built with the sole intention of mining Bitcoin. They are not re-programmable for any other purpose than mining SHA-256 coins like Bitcoin. That makes them extremely efficient compared to GPUs, which has raised the difficulty to such obscene levels that mining with a GPU today is just throwing your money away.
Unless you're willing to invest serious $$$ then stay out of the mining game. Sure there are some CPU and GPU friendly coins out there (Monero, Vertcoin) but their profitability is just not worth it unless you get free/ cheap electricity IMO.

15.5 lost on the UK exchange Intersango when it shut down.
I tried contacting one of the co-owners Patrick Strateman about it, he told me he found my account details and that it would take 'time to process' but everytime I contacted him after that he just ignored me.
It drove me nuts for 2-3 years after I gave up, more than anything because I never got closure, if he had just told me the money was gone and I'd never get it back I could've made peace with it.
I have since had 2 other people contact me telling me that they managed to get their BTC back from him after much back and forth. They were both 'only' in the region of 1 BTC each so part of me thinks he just paid them out of his own stash and didn't want to do the same for me.
Given how life changing that money would be to me now I am going to try again soon but I know it will probably be in vein.

Look, I understand the importance of the price as a sign of how well Bitcoin is doing and the need to discuss it, but predicting what that price will be in x years by drawing lines on a chart is just as pointless to the Bitcoin discussion as my previous comment was to this one. 
I have an opinion on what the price will be in a couple of years but unless I'm asked I just keep it to myself, because I am almost certainly going to be wrong.
You could at least give a reason as to why you think the price would ever grow so exponentially in such a short time.

Price speculation is only interesting when talking to people who are just getting in to Bitcoin, it's always a good conversation starter for people new to the scene.
However, we should really try and stay away from discussing it here because at the end of the day it's all speculation, PERIOD. Plot whatever fucking graph you want and draw whatever vague correlations you want from it but you CANNOT predict the future so just shut the FUCK up about it.

A 51% attack that allows for someone to double spend is like me purchasing something from you, except I don't give you the cash for it straight away, I only show you a box with the money inside to prove I have the funds.
Then I tell you that you I will leave the box outside and you can pick the money up in about 10 minutes. Immediately after that I will do the exact same thing in another store, so now it's a matter of luck which one gets to the money first. 
Or I could just take the money from the box (i.e a bitcoin wallet) when I leave the store and transfer it to another one.
So no, this process does not affect the rate at which new bitcoins are generated.

OK then. Hypothetically speaking, if 1000000 BTC just appeared in my wallet right now and it was there on the blockchain for everyone to see, would the price automatically adjust due to that influx of BTC even if I just keep it there? 
As I see it what would happen is the value of 1 BTC would go down since it is now only 1/14Mth of the supply rather than 1/13Mth, but the USD asking price would remain the same. If we ignore the psychological impact it might have on those mushy things in people's skulls that is.

I'm not asking Andreas to be Bitcoin CEO or anything, but convincing a nation's government about the potential of blockchain tech isn't a job for just anybody. I can't think of many others who would be willing and able. Plus he seems to enjoy doing it, which not many others would I'd expect; I know I'd be shitting my pants if it was me lecturing a bunch of MPs. So I don't see why it's a bad thing.
However, yes I wish we didn't have to rely on him to do all the best public speaking but unfortunately right now that seems to be the case.

Seconded, I bought with a debit card on Circle and paid less than what anyone was offering on LBC at the time.
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:29:55
They previously would allow you to set the discount as high as 50% Then they changed the max discount you can set to 33%
However their fees increase the higher you set the discount. So at 50% discount you would actually get more like 37% off your order. Where as if you set discount at 40% you would get around a 33% discount.
It's definitely not as attractive for me as it used to be. I'm in the UK and since Circle went full retard I'm paying 2.5-3% fees to purchase bitcoin. So these days I can expect to save no more than 25% on purchases after taking broker and purse's fees in to account.
Whilst that is still decent, a lot of stuff on Amazon is overpriced compared to elsewhere anyway so it's not even worth the hassle, especially since 2 out of 3 times the order gets cancelled on Amazon's side and I have to contact purse support, which is really frustrating.
Techy things are what I use purse for mostly since they are generally competitively priced on Amazon.

I deal with it by knowing that if the price goes to 0 then it won't cripple me financially, it'll just set me back a bit. I'll move on and deal with it knowing I saw an opportunity that felt worthwhile and gave it a shot.
For me it's worth the risk because the pay off could potentially be huge in the long term. I won't touch the vast majority of my investment and will keep on accruing for at least another 10 years if not longer.

As someone else has suggested, a HW.1 would be ideal for your scenario, especially if you plan on accruing more in the future.
Get a nano if you plan on carrying it around with you since it will be more durable and looks nicer on your key ring. Otherwise if you plan on storing it in one location just get the HW.1 and use the spare change to buy a few more bits. That's what I did at least.

In 20 years time nearly all commerce on the internet will take place through some form of blockchain, it really is inevitable.
Right now Bitcoin looks most likely to be the defacto blockchain. Combined with the fact that it shares similar properties to gold, it could potentially be worth many times its present value one day if people begin to see it as a good store of value.
So if you're looking for a long term investment then Bitcoin is a good choice IMO.

No one can tell you which way will make the most profit. The most sensible idea however would be to just buy a set amount every day/ week/ month so as to average out the price at which you pay per BTC.
You could try saving up for a few months and then buying when the price drops, but conversely you could end up saving for several months and the price of bitcoins doubles in that time.

The problem is you pretty much always have to go down the route of why bitcoin is real money when explaining it to new people, which leads in to a half hour lecture on the history of money and the differences between good and bad ones.
That's before you even get to the technical explanation of how bitcoin works and why the world needs it.
Then when walking them through how to buy it, you need to explain addresses, public and private keys, seeds &amp; backups, fees, the difference between storing on an exchange and holding in your own wallet.
The list goes on and on, it's no easy feat to explain all that to someone succinctly.

Nobody can say for certain as no one has access to perfect information about every single trade made on all exchanges and the reasons why that person decided to buy at that moment. We can only guess.
IMO it's probably mostly because the halvening is coming up combined with the fact that Chinese people love to speculate/ gamble, especially when their national currency is being devalued (source: am half Chinese).
If you want a measure of how valuable/ useful of a currency it is becoming then look at the [daily transaction volume.](

Because there is no direct incentive to do so. Right now the reasons to run a node are:
* For mining
* To validate your own transactions
* Altruism
I think if we ever see mass adoption that will change because companies/ organisations will want to run their own node and will have the resources to do so. Not everyone here has a spare pc they can run 24/7, with enough spare disk space, good enough internet speed and no data caps.
Hell the only reason I run a node is because I can get old computers from my workplace for free and have 100Mbps at home.
Also fingers crossed mining might become more decentralised in the future. More miners spread over more pools = more nodes.

It's possible to upgrade and be backwards compatible, that is exactly what segwit does.
You see the bitcoin core developers are extremely cautious of making drastic changes that might cause contention and thus people to lose money. Hence why they made segwit backwards compatible, to reduce the risk of a hard fork that would throw the price in to chaos and a requirement of 95% of the mining power to signal that they have upgraded and are ready before it comes in to effect on the network.
These guys are volunteering their time to make these upgrades, they aren't paid, so you tell me who you think the bad actors are here, the volunteers or the ones with a profit incentive who are pushing for bitcoin cash and 2x (the miners).

I kept it all on an exchange called britcoin (later changed to intersango) since I had no clue what I was doing back then, then when it crashed I gave up and forgot about it. Soon after the exchange went insolvent and then when I got back in to bitcoin in early 2013 I tried to retrieve it, I spoke to the their 'support' and they said they found my funds but they never sent it to me despite emailing them again and again.
It's worth £30,000 now... For someone who works a crappy paid job and is stuck renting that's a life changing amount of money ugh...

Download bitcoin core from bitcoin.org and install then run initial setup. 
Once the program opens and starts downloading the blockchain, close it and browse to %appdata% in Windows or ~/library/application/support/bitcoin on mac.
Delete the wallet.dat file in there and replace it with your 2014-04-30.dat, renaming it to wallet.dat once you've done so. 
Then run bitcoin core again and let it sync (will take many hours and requires 130gb or so of space).
Once it's fully synced hopefully you should have a balance, you may have also set a password on the wallet in 2014 which will still be required if you want to send so I hope you remember it if you did set one.
Good luck.

As of writing on Coinbase's website they charge £147.02 per BTC.
£147.02 + 3% = £151.43 per BTC.
There are currently cheaper options with LocalBitcoins and Cryptopay according to bittybot.co.uk.
Sure they aren't as convenient but they are cheaper and allow for more sizeable purchases than £100.

The minimum you should buy one at is when you own more btc than the price of the hw wallet you want to buy.

In the UK at least, you are allowed to realise a certain amount of assets before paying capital gains tax. 
Last I heard it was £11k but I think it may have gone up slightly and the % of tax has decreased since this years' budget.
If there ever came a time where I want to realise a lot more than the yearly allowance, I'll probably move to somewhere like Guernsey that has no capital gains tax.
EDIT: 2016 update: The capital gains tax (CGT) rate was significantly cut in the 2016 Budget. From April 2016, those who pay basic-rate income tax will pay CGT at 10% (down from 18%), and higher-rate taxpayers will be charged CGT at 20% (down from 28%). 
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:31:39
I'm not sure if it's possible to know that information as you can have various multiples of leverage, so you could start with $100 and borrow $200 or $300, $400 etc. and also it depends on how much collateral they left in their account to cover losses as the price of btc began to rise. Only the exchange would be able to tell you that (which they surely wouldn't do). You could work out a rough minimum figure probably by using the maximum leverage multiplier the exchange it occured on offers (OKex is 20x I think).
The lenders make a small daily percentage I believe and it is the exchange that forces the margin call and returns the funds to lenders.
I've never quite had the balls to margin trade so what I said may not be 100% correct. Sadly I have only ever heard of bad things happening from margin trading so my advice is to stay away and just hodl.

I recall vaguely something I think Andreas said in one of his talks.
We use lots of different types of currency in our everyday lives already.
We have metal coins for little things like parking tolls or snacks from a vending machine, notes for average purchases like food and drink, credit cards for large purchases like cars, cheques for rent and bills.
We don't necessarily need bitcoin to replace these use cases. Bitcoin is suited best for online transactions.

If you buy a bunch of bitcoins and hold on to them indefinitely then yes you make them scarcer for everyone else.
If you had the money to try and buy 90% of bitcoins in existence as of now then yes the price would go much much higher than it is now because there would only be 10% remaining for everyone else. By purchasing them you have created a huge demand for bitcoin.
Conversely if you were to then try and sell your 90% stake then it would crash the price because you have created a huge influx in the supply of bitcoin.
This is a bit of a simplification and I'm by no means an economist or expert, but it's just the basic idea of supply and demand.

Chances are we will have many blockchains/ sidechains with differing monetary policies that are interoperable in the future, with bitcoin as a sort of backbone/ reserve for them all.
Well that's what I think will happen anyway.

Also part of the reason why fees are higher is because people actually use bitcoin, unlike bcash which has far fewer transactions per day than bitcoin thus it has cheaper fees.
@_date: 2015-02-11 11:17:06
I guess I do actually, not that I think about it like that, but yeah I mined a lot more LTC than BTC just because I found it too confusing back when you could mine BTC with a GPU. So I gave up after only mining 5 BTC with a single card. Only when Litecoin came along did I finally get to grips with how cryptocurrencies worked.
That said I'm still 90% BTC and 10% LTC because I've only ever spent fiat on bitcoin and I no longer mine.
