So, how much can one make here?
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:19:09
I email square cash to people all the time.
It's super simple, takes a few minutes to confirm and clear, and the transaction is completed bank account to bank account usually within the hour but guaranteed within 48 hours.

I'm similar, I lost my account with tips and stuff and had to make a new one. Fresh. No tips, no coin. No nothing. I was tipped, then I entered a few giveaways, and now I've got enough bits to spread around. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 05:34:53
Neither can I.
From what I can gather it was a one time effort to stimulate the Bitcoin economy and get people on Reddit interested in Bitcoin, but that was before the price bubble and there was not always a large pool of bitcoin to pay from.
The last thread I looked at had a pool of $60 in BTC to donate with and each user could get up to a dollar.
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:27:10
I like that idea, it would be kind of troublesome to see all the confirmations in a thread with a lot of tipping

@_date: 2014-11-24 05:15:21
What if I only know about putting computers together and have little idea of the nature of Bitcoin, programming, or software, really?
I guess what I'm asking is if I can just build a low powered computer from 90s and early 2000s parts and just run a node and bitcoinqt on it for kicks, or if there is a need for quality hardware or something.
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:30:17
I'll look into it. The context for the original stately pleasure dome is [here]( and I've been admittedly milking it since, so it may be getting kind of stale.

@_date: 2014-11-25 19:51:54
Thanks, I'll get a DCtoAC converter box for my Redditmobile's cigarette lighter when all of these bits are worth a dollar. In the meantime, I'm going to tip the winner.
I actually registered a circle account just now, and after going through the extremely easy process I found myself unable to confirm it on my PC.
I'll have to try on mobile.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:11:34
I'd absolutely love that, I'd tweet the crud out of it.

I was on IE. Then I switched over to firefox.
Then I came back to reddit to see what was up, tipped the guy, and now I'm publishing some [content]( on one of my sites to make a few bucks on my off day.
I'll give it another shot later

@_date: 2014-11-09 05:24:52
To a certain degree this is true. I've done a day's worth of comments on another site for about 10 dollars, so getting 13 dollars in exchange for a not-very-populated post is somewhat disproportionate.
@_date: 2014-11-25 18:44:51
That is good to know. Apparently, according to they also offer instant pay instead of a 4-5 day delay

I never thought of that. I just came up with the stately pleasure dome like this morning anyway.
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:29:27
I think that is a valid consideration. I'm just trying to think of a way to do it now, with currently available tools
@_date: 2014-12-05 06:34:07
Not necessarily bitcoin specific, but in general
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:32:04
You've got a point. If more transactions=more votes, people could defraud by voting multiple times.
Also, a bit is a satoshi. I just correlated them for the first time, edited my top level.
This is a really interesting idea. I know that if you use the blockchain you can "see into" a bitcoin address's history and know the number of transactions and the amount of BTC present, so that might be a bit of what you need but I'm not sure what else would need to be built to make this idea work.
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:14:07
You could have everyone who cares drop in one satoshi, and use something like blockchain.info to count transactions on each cause.
More transactions=more votes, highest # of transactions wins.
But I guess that this simplified system would be easier to fake, by duplication of transactions.
Edit: 1  bit=1 satoshi, so there's that.

If the only value is as a cash transfer service, where you buy X number of bits for the service and the service on behalf of the recipient sells X number of bits so that the recipient can receive the money it makes sense.
If you pay the service 1 dollar, it buys bitcoin, and sends your friend a dollar, it makes sense.
But when you actually gain ownership of any amount of bitcoin, it stops making sense to tie it artificially to fiat currency.

I think that it's better to be honest with people, if you truly ignored the volatility you could end up massively profiting off of current customers in a market upswing or tanking in the event of a downturn.
Honesty allows you to keep doing business, and putting up a false barrier could potentially damage a business structure in the case of a market fluctuation.
