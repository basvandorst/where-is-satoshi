I love watching this as a seasoned Hodler.  Makes it exciting yet not terrifying.  Best entertainment.
@_date: 2019-06-26 22:28:35
Hodl gan.  You gotta get beat in.

Only a few days left to buy at this level.   If that.   Strap in hodlers.

Trezor has a good reputation if you're going cold storage.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:11:27
thanks i don't want to update i don't see the point? I have the seed so no worries.  Just wish i could plug and use just like before.
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:47:35
i know there see many like me who haven't plugged in their Trezor in years.   Should i worry about anything like software updates?

not exactly!
@_date: 2019-06-22 14:19:35
i don't see plateau here after this crazy movement.  imo either keeps going up some more like to 13 or 13.5 before consolidating OR dumping back to 9.9 ish.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:41:39
Guys do what you want but this volatility is imo NOT the time to trade.   although failed shorts are feeding the Hodlers so maybe carry on?
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:34:07
We are nocoiners jealous and bitter?
@_date: 2019-06-22 12:34:59
@_date: 2019-06-21 15:27:53
I think this bullrun will hit 60k and then drop back to 32k that's being conservative tho
I base it on gut

Hold on to your butts boys, it's moon time.  PAAaaawmp it!

 correction: they talk a different game but in the end one party pushes the corporate agenda and the other folds to it,  regardless of what they say they're for.

I am but a simple holder.  Two questions:
1.Where can i see all these candles and sell walls and such?
2. Why should i not be worried about Tether printing?

Yes,  precious.
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:23:57
Now is a lower risk time to buy.  Notice i said lower.   I would buy more if i could.   Just never more than you can afford to write off!  Then you'll never be truly stressed. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:58:14
But  we all float down here
