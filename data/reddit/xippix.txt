If you don't know everything there is to know about bitcoin, why are you promoting it? Do your homework first. You're doing more bad than good.  
Do you know why you can generate an adress and use it securely offline?  
Do you know the chance of generating an identical adress twice? How about identical wdresses with identical private keys?  
Do you know how you can arrange a transaction with a middleman who hold the money?
Learn this stuff, be prepared for difficult questions, be passionate but don't shove it in people's faces.

To all the people kicking themselves over not buying then; if you had read about it back then, you would have probably read something like it was being used on tor to buy drugs and weapons, you probably wouldn't have been interested long enough to read the whitepaper or find more information at all.  
Imagine hearing about wow gold or linden dollars in second life. That's what it looked like then. A scammy, weird, useless, fake e-currency thing.
Now, let's say you were interested despite that, you would probably have mined a few thousand for a while, got distracted by some game on steam and deleted the wallet. Thereby losing your coins and hanging yourself a few years later during the $1000 bubble because you knew you had shitloads but just deleted them.
Let say you mined or bought some and kept them anyway.  
You might have bought a 10.000btc pizza because you could finally do something with the coins. You could have sold them for $40 each because that seemed like the highest they would ever go. Or even worse, you could have sold them for $20 after that bubble.
The people who got on board back then and still hold most of their btc right now truly believed in bitcoin and will probably never sell.  
If you regret not buying because you missed out on big profits, then it would probably have ended badly for you some way. And if it's really just profit you want, then now is a perfect time to buy more bitcoin. It will probably not go much lower than it is now, and the next big bubble might be on the horizon.

The only real problem that is stopping Bitcoin (crypto) from spreading out like crazy is that there's no real incentive for people to convert their dollars / euros / whatever into BTC. There's no added value in doing that.  
Why would the average person first find out how to buy bitcoin, wait three days for their deposit to an exchange to come through, then convert to BTC, find out how the hell it all works and then spend it on a website when they could just pay with paypal or visa on that very same website.
This is also why it's not really a good thing for BTC to be accepted by big retailers. It's mostly people who already owned BTC that are now spending it, there's no new money coming in because of them. And all the big companies just dump the BTC and drive the price down.

If something happens that would wipe out ALL data around the world, it would probably kill all humans too.  
If there are any survivors afterwards, they will probably not re-instate money any time soon, especially not a digital currency because... well, there's no more internet.  
If any of the survivors ever used or even heard of bitcoin suggest to use a digital currency instead of regular fiat when a society does get rebuild, then they will CERTAINLY not be using the old blockchain. They will just start a new one.

Lets say he's poor and goes to a city to rent a pc and an internet connection, why doesn't he go to a pharmacy and buy it there?
And to your second point. With 6 billion people you mean everyone except the US, right? And with walmart.com you mean American stores, right? Even with bitcoin people wouldn't do that. Other parts of the world have the exact same products that are sold in the US, so why would they spend a fortune on shipping?

This is the second, but most meaningful, argument against bitcoin I have heard that actually makes sense.
But we're not even close to bitcoin being a currency accepted worldwide, and I don't think bitcoin will be the coin to do that. This is crypto v0.1.3, it'll take a few more designs before there is a crypto that is resilient enough to take over the world.

It does. When I make an offline adress. Lets say on an ubuntu live CD that's not connected to the internet. I generate a new adress and then encrypt the wallet. Afterwards I send BTC to the generated adress.

Umm yeah... normal people generally can't do that.

Do not trust this
@_date: 2018-03-06 07:59:12
You copied that from twitter
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:57:47
Good. Another threat gone. Lots more to go though.

So, better security and ease of use? Then combine 3 of your fingerprints to generate a private key, use any one of those fingerprints to confirm transactions. Optionally combined with iris identification. It's on any modern phone now anyway.
Moving to a new phone is easy, you just scan your fingerprints again and you get access to your wallet.
Paying would be easier. Just scan the QR code and fingerprint.

The top 5 should be trusted a lot less than they currently are.

Now watch the big short. It's the prequel.

Let say the seller is someone who has had those bitcoins for a few years. Someone else buys them and then immediately sells for ethereum or another coin. Then that brings the btc price down. A little.

Up until that last line I was getting nervous in your place
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:07:23
That's because 85% of people are convinced that someone will run off with your dollars the second you buy bitcoin and then bitcoin will be turned off.
At least that's what my family said when I told them about it.
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:11:28
Oh, ok.
@_date: 2017-09-03 11:57:20
There will be more and more transactions, so the fees for individual txs can go down.
@_date: 2017-09-11 08:01:41
Well... yes. That's exactly why it was made.

He's holding dollars... biased.

Love this podcast. Short and sweet every time. A little too short maybe.

If you're looking at it over a time span of 10 years, then I would assume you're going to make a hell of a return.
The only things stopping you from being a rich 26 year old is either a global bitcoin ban or you losing the key to your wallet.

The people selling are the same guys buying into icos by sending ether from an exchange. And then complaining here that they didn't get their tokens.
Not the sharpest tools in the shed.
On the other hand, if all this fud starts a firesale then they will be the lucky ones and we will have to invest more money again to buy more.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:05:40

He won't dump those coins until they're 20k each.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:05:03
How is it that you've gone through all those rises and falls and still believe it has something to do with 'news'? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:17:14
Daytrading with 3600 ltc? Noice. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:24:46
Well... who do they return the coins to now? He people who suffered from mtgox or the people who bought them on btce? I'm guessing they will auction them. 
I'm not being serious. Relax reddit.

Username wrong...
@_date: 2017-07-26 16:40:53
I believe someone said that when mtgox went down. 
Along those lines at least. Something something less coins more value.

And now you're waiting for the next bubble to buy in again?
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:54:00
Imagine there's only 1 bitcoin and you own it. I buy it from you for $1. 1btc is worth $1 now.  
Now you want it back and I sell it to you for $100, 1 btc is now worth $100.  
You panic and sell it to someone else for $50. 1 btc is now worth $50.  
There's your eli5 version.
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:22:23
1 is the correct answer
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:22:32
The 1%. Sound familiar?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:11:56
Yes it is. Too bad a lot of people bought btc for the wrong reasons.
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:52:17
Just 57M? You want a kick in the nuts?
@_date: 2013-12-18 08:53:34
All the people panicking are uninformed. Don't worry, sit back and keep half an eye on the price. This crash was predicted, it happened at the last bubble too. The price will go up again after the China rumors and stabilize for a while. Next bubble in 6 months going to... Dunno... $4000?
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:05:07
You are 100% correct. Value aside, this is exactly what was to be expected and this had to happen for bitcoin to become what it is made for, a currency that is not tied to dollars or euros. Unfortunatly people don't seem to grasp that concept. We have something that the government doesn't have a grasp on, what did people expect to happen? Right now its us, the people, who would have to hold on to our coins, even if the value drops to $0. That's the point. We, customers and merchants, assign a value to it and use it as money. Governments will lose their minds. That's the idea behind bitcoin, that's what we really want. Everyone who is dumping coins right now does not understand that concept. Your 1 btc is worth whatever you can buy with it, not how much $$$ you can get for it.
