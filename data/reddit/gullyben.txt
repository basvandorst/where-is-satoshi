She DOES cry- at 5:02 you can see a tear roll down her face on the left side and she turns her head to try to make it less obvious

Happy birthday!!
@_date: 2014-02-12 20:21:20
Perfect thanks for this...just did the same.
Need to find a place to buy her a card with btc now...
@_date: 2014-04-25 21:26:45
I seriously can't wait for this app.  I park in nyc all the time and it's such an expensive huge pain.  My friends and I have been trying to figure out some kind of app like this but we couldn't figure out the incentive part - I think you guys nailed it.  Hope it takes off with or without bitcoin!  Although bitcoin payment would be so much easier...
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:28:25
Oh my god.  I want this car.
@_date: 2014-03-07 17:11:02
You are welcome!  I'm going to try my best to keep the warnings section up to date with the latest bitcoin threats as they appear - want to make it a really useful resource.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:16:33
I'm going to be doing my best to list all warnings as soon as they come up on bitcoinlayman.com - I've just started recently so there aren't many but I've just added this one.  Not many people read the site yet but I'm hoping to be responsive enough that it becomes a useful resource.  Just trying to help not promote my shitty blog, so if enough people are offended by this I will delete my post
@_date: 2014-06-12 14:07:45
I just booked a flight there with bitcoin yesterday
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:50:21
We are located in the NYC area BTW :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:51:00
Can anyone confirm this is legitimate?
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:58:10
Haha well it's slightly different to be naively optimistic about climate change don't you think? Has a few more consequences than a failed company :)
@_date: 2015-05-18 23:07:24
Agree on all 3 points
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:35:54
Well I've outlined a couple of reasons mining may be better in other comments, but I admit I'm not an expert and you may be right.  
However, they've worked on this for years, crunched numbers, raised millions of dollars from smart people and big companies - and yet in a few hours of thinking about it, people in this thread are so immediately sure that they're stupid and that it can't work.  I'd just rather give them the benefit of the doubt, considering this could potentially be the biggest push for mainstreaming bitcoin we've ever seen if it actually works.
OF COURSE, it's not like companies with smart people and big investors haven't come up with stupid failed ideas before.  This could very well be a dumb idea.
I'm just saying, I'd rather talk about what COULD work, and speculate on the possibilities, rather than immediately tearing it down.  Because there may be aspects of this that we don't know about yet &amp; plans that haven't been revealed.
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:59:09
sidechains?  Lightning network?  Who knows.  That's definitely a hurdle with the current technology.  
As for the energy expenditure - I think it's more of a convenience factor for the average consumer.  The average person doesn't want to setup a coinbase account and connect their bank account etc. just to buy $1 worth of internet money that makes their toaster connect to some "internet of things" that they don't even understand.  If it just worked automatically out of the box, they might enjoy the benefits without even knowing how it worked.
I can't imagine a killer blockchain app for a toaster at the moment haha, but you get my point
Down the road, the "blockchain" or "world wide ledger" or whatever catches on is a household name, and then you start hearing people saying "did you know you can do X over this BLOCKCHAIN thing?"
Like "did you know you can order BOOKS over the INTERNET?"
Third complaint - maybe in mobile devices it only mines when charging/plugged in
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:40:59
for the amount of satoshis necessary to make this kind of thing work, they could use pretty low powered miners, so the electricity cost could be negligible.  Or could be partially subsidized by the mining?  Guess we'll have to see what their strategy is
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:36:22
Yes that would probably be cheaper, but here's where I see the benefit:
1) the device will continue to replenish itself automatically (obviously more slowly over time, but I would think a majority of electronics these are installed in have a life of less than 5 years anyway).  It only needs to be a small trickle for it to work.  There's a slight convenience benefit there vs. having them preloaded but I know it's not a super strong argument - the real benefit (to bitcoin) is the next point
2) there will be millions of tiny miners out in the wild, massively growing/decentralizing the network.
CAVEAT - we don't know how mining will be setup, so if all of these miners are contributing to a single pool, point  is actually a huge negative.  But we don't know how it'll work.  They say that a portion will go to them, a portion to the consumer, and a portion to the device manufacturer, so if they're really trying to use this technology to improve the network, they will do it in a distributed way.  Maybe different pools for different device manufacturers?  Who knows, but it's an important thing to watch out for.
3) potential benefit that I think is logical but remains to be seen - secure hardware wallets built into all devices.  So all phones might by default have an (unhackable?) wallet built right in.  Not an expert so please feel free to tell me if I'm off base, but this seems like a logical thing.
I would like to have faith in them, knowing a bit about the founders - their main goal (besides making money, as they are a business) seems to be to grow the bitcoin network and make it mainstream.  But we have learned the hard way to be skeptical...
Either way, the parties involved and the scale of the vision is really exciting no matter how you slice it - I think we should be (cautiously) cheering this on!
@_date: 2014-03-05 03:28:52
Just ordered some!
Will report back on how they taste :)
@_date: 2015-05-19 00:09:50
You could say the same about any Bitcoin wallet.  Why is this different
Edit:  sorry that was poorly worded
I guess my question is, what doesn't add up about mining to a wallet that's on your device?  Not sure what you're saying unless you're making the point that all the devices may mine to a single 21 owned pool.  Which may be true but we don't know how that will work yet.
Of course the satoshis aren't 'stored' on any device, but you could say that about any wallet.
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:20:34
Unfortunately I agree with you.  But I'm going to be naively optimistic because it feels better
@_date: 2015-05-18 21:52:28
I don't think we have enough information to make any solid arguments yet.  
I would think that after all this time, and attracting all that VC money, they have figured out something that makes sense.  Maybe if their profits were coming strictly from mining, then economically it doesn't make sense, but there may be more to it than we know, or a long term gameplan we're not aware of and this is just laying the pipes.  Or they're just dumb and it won't work and Qualcomm and Cisco didn't do their due diligence.
Either way, if it helps mainstream bitcoin, and enable more uses of the blockchain, it's a good thing.  
If it does that, but in the process ends up giving them over 50% of the hash power, that's a bad thing.
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:12:30
That is definitely an argument worth exploring...
I guess the question is whether or not they'd have a way to link the address associated with your hardware with your identity.  With something like a phone or a router, I would guess there's no way to be safe.
Maybe the real question is, is there some kind of protocol-level protection that could guarantee anonymity?  Using a different public key for every transaction?
Not a technical expert in any way, but would love to hear some discussion about this...
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:48:15
It may be profitable (or at least break-even) for 21 though - you have to remember that when you buy miners it's generally not a profitable operation, but if you're manufacturing the chips, and have mass economies of scale, your costs may be lower than what you end up mining.  Plus they're making a profit on both ends - selling the chips to electronics manufacturers AS WELL as taking a portion of the mining.  AND, assuming this works, bitcoin should theoretically become more valuable as a side effect of making the network more useful
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:54:16
No I don't, that's why I said 'could'
All speculation here
@_date: 2014-04-17 05:12:13
This is seriously great.  Simple and fast.  Can't wait to see this progress!
$5 (my first time tipping!)
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:59:30
How is that, does it broadcast your IP?  Not doubting, genuinely curious
@_date: 2015-05-18 19:24:21
Guys I think a lot of you are missing the big picture here.  This is not meant to mine for profit primarily, this is so that all consumer devices by default have a small store of satoshis available to send back and forth for many different applications, ie authentication.  All you need is a few satoshis available on massive amounts of electronics by default, and you have the power of a secure ledger, and all the things we've been dreaming &amp; speculating about,  available to the masses, whether they know it or not.
This should be thought of as a way of enabling millions of people to use the Bitcoin protocol for all kinds of future killer apps BY DEFAULT.  We all know that the only way Bitcoin is going to succeed is by getting people to use it, and building these chips into millions of consumer devices could be the really important start of a brand new kind of network using the blockchain with infinite possibilities.
TLDR - this is about networking and building mass infrastructure, not about profiting from mining.  This is the most promising thing I've seen in awhile and I'm surprised there's so much negativity about it, I for one am excited imagining the possibilities!!
Maybe people are disappointed because it's not the kind of thing that instantly says "moon", but I would actually argue that it does.  The only way the price will rise is if it's used, and this could be a massive step towards practical next-gen uses of the protocol!
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:05:54
This seems to be his first post on this particular forum since 2009 though, correct?  (assuming not a hacked account, of course)
@_date: 2017-03-25 06:38:16
I hope this is satire...wow
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:54:34
Right - I dedicated a whole paragraph to that exact point.  
However you're assuming that you know how they're going to setup the pools.  I'm not naive enough to ASSUME they're going to go the distributed route, but I'm hoping they're not going to completely centralize it to their own pool.
One thing that gives me hope, is that they MUST aware of the shitstorm it would cause with the community if they took ownership of all that hash power.  I'm also aware of some of their philosophies about decentralization so hopefully they do the right thing...would not be surprised if it went the wrong way though.
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:45:46
This looks perfect thanks!! 
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:50:33
Any idea if they do recurring transfers?  Don't see it in their FAQ
@_date: 2015-03-24 01:35:25
Yes we all want that obviously.  But the exact wrong way to do it is by giving companies that are clearly scams the chance to take advantage of people.  That's exactly what gives Bitcoin a bad name.  
I shouldn't even have to say that, it's just common sense, but you must know that already -  you can't just post some "Bitcoin patriot," "I just want to see Bitcoin succeed" boilerplate reply and expect that we're going to be like "yeah, this guy's right!  He can't be a shill just look at how much he loves Bitcoin!"
Just quit man.
And if you're not, and are somehow just truly naïve, then I am genuinely sorry for accusing you.  But if that's true then this is something you really need to hear anyway because you're going to get scammed hard with that kind of trust in the face of an obvious scam.
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:49:54
I seriously hope nobody is falling for this
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:02:59
I think it's kind of interesting.  Not groundbreaking or anything but kind of interesting.  It's like buying a portable WIFI router that can charge your phone on its battery if you're traveling with it, and since it's pre-configured to mine solo, you are buying a marginally useful everyday device that just happens to give you a chance at winning the lottery.  I know...I know...the chances are slim.  But what if every tech manufacturer started putting low powered miners into every device?  If I were shopping for a router, and there were 2 models that were the same in features in price except one of them gave me the small chance of hitting it big with a block reward, I would go for that one :)
@_date: 2015-03-23 06:13:53
I don't know if you're aware that it's very obvious you're in on this somehow - I'm not claiming to know in what capacity, whether you were paid to start a discussion about it, or your account was hijacked, or something deeper, but it is obvious.  The other possibility is that you're just super naïve, but that's just as bad when it's potentially leading other naïve people off the cliff with you.
You throw in some comments here and there that try to make yourself look impartial but it's easy to see through.
Come on dude, you expect me to believe an honest, rational person could read that comment about the bitcointalk thread below, see what an obvious scam this whole thing is and THEN post "but what if it works"?
I see this sort of thing on this subreddit all the time, but I usually give it a pass because it's generally benign - the obvious plugging of a bitcoin service by asking a question ("has anybody used XX?"), the too-perfect comments that follow - but that's not really hurting anyone.
This is though.
Or maybe I'm just paranoid, that's possible too.  But I know if it was me who started this thread, and I saw the comments that you saw, I would be like..."oh.  Yeah this is obviously too good to be true.  Thread over."
@_date: 2015-10-08 17:07:19
Also, and I know this has been discussed at length before when talking about 21 inc etc, but routers w mining chips seems to pave the way for renting out your bandwidth, mesh nets, etc.
I'm not bringing up anything new here just thought I'd mention it before the sea of "what's the point of this" and "this is so useless" posts come up.  We're looking at the beginning stages of a larger picture I think.  Lots of useless baby steps but we'll get there!
