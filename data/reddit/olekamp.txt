Why be a dick about it?
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:55:55
I've bought in at ATH probably like 75% of the time, but I've still made a decent profit. I've never sold any but I once spent $10 on some bullshit I didn't actually need... I still regret it lol
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:31:02
I heard it's got electrolytes
@_date: 2017-11-08 11:43:43
It's currently worth $1278
Edit: 7 hours later it's worth $138. lmao RIP

How about we just come together as a community to do a fork which everyone/most people can agree on(lol)? After all we both want Bitcoin to succeed.. I can agree that BTC needs change but s2x was too sketchy. All this uncertainity is extremely bad for the whole crypto industry, it pushes newcomers away, it's like putting sticks in a tandem bikes wheel..
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:28:34
I literally had to rub my eyes to check if my eyes didn't screw with me just now, I checked 15 minutes ago and it was about 7450, suddenly over 7750.. Whoa
Edit: 7800!!!
Edit: It just touched 7900

Investing in bitcoin kinda feels like planting money trees
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:10:39
It's a correction combined with Bitcoin Cash FOMO. No need to worry as it most likely won't even touch 6000..
After that it will probably shoot up fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:06:00
Very simple to use, and most people start there.
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:48:14
Coinbase have some real ugly looking fees though
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:19:03
Right now is a perfect time to buy, you could wait longer but from what I'm seeing it looks like it's starting to bounce back up.

Lol, I do something similar. I like to watch BTC-USD on Gdax sometimes if there's a bull run. But whenever the bears start stacking I leave.
