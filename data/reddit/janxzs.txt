I think a large argument for decentralization comes from the history of this country. I'm not sure if this is quite the direction you're going for but hey...
Anyways, our founding fathers created the constitution as a group of states that wanted to work together to coexist harmoniously and productively. There was no mention of religion, no mention of a central bank. It wasn't until those founding fathers were long dead that a central bank arose. Furthermore, thanks to the plotting of the 1% elite rich on Jekyll Island who drafted the bill for the federal reserve, for the last hundred years, the people of the united states have been trapped under this shitty US dollar and now live in a capitalistic oligarchy.
Granted currency is only one of the problems that face the young people of tomorrows' society, but I think Bitcoin is a big step in the right direction. And give the states more power you damned national government who hates spending money on education and space programs!
