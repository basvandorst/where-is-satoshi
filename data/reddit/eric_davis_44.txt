Nope "No incidents reported today"

Yup.  
Looking forward to dumping my bcash to buy more bitcoin when coinbase releases it.

After watching the resilience tonight I actually feel stronger than ever looking forward about btc.  ������
Get ready for a lot of bcash selloff today followed by btc buys w the new money.  Should be an interesting trading day.  Popcorn ��

Last chance at adding some btc under 20k.  You will look back in 6 months at that transaction and wish you had bought more.

Even if we are able to fork past the sun exploding we have the universe collapsing back on itself down the line from there to deal with.  I assure you this is not FUD, just a legit observation we need to discuss

Reasonable comments.  Not FUD.  Actually seems to be reluctantly coming around to neutral which is a good thing.  If he goes from neutral to slightly bullish in subsequent months it's good for the community given his mainstream audience.  That's good for everyone currently holding / HODL'ing whether or not you like or respect Cramer or not.

Same error and I've had my account working without issue for months .  I'm unable to withdrawal USD and unable to withdrawal btc from gdax.  
Anyone else having this issue?

When coinbase supports bcash early next year simply take advantage of the artificially pumped price , dump the bcash right back into bitcoin .  Easy.  Looking forward to the free money to buy more bitcoin on the cheap.

Goodluck - my parents and a few of my friends just decided to start doing the same.  ����
