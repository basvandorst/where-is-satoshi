It's what is suggested by electrum. I lowered it all the way to the left and it looks like it would take days to confirm

Store of Value? According to wikipedia "A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved and exchanged at a later time, and be predictably useful when retrieved". Keyword being predictable. Bitcoin isn't predictable. It can't go up indefinitely. It's not a tangible commodity.  Eventually the bubble will burst and the value will plummet.  Exactly the opposite of a store of value.

Yeah any currency that needs to be used at the scale of 15k to be efficient isn't that great

Maybe but how do I go about getting my money out without the fees? Catch 22

But, currency has never been about an investment. It's a means of exchange between people for goods and services. I thought the whole point of bitcoin was to provide a convenient, decentralized, low fee alternative than the status quo fiat currency. What's the incentive to use bitcoin over say paypal now that the fees are so high? It is neither convenient or low fee anymore.

Met in the middle paid .002 $3.19 on a $40.64 cent transaction to send a digital currency from point a to point b. Slow clap guys. Guess I just need to manually enter this stuff

Meh is it a currency or a commodity? If it's a currency I expect it to be able to at least be processed in the time it would take for amazon to charge my credit card and ship a package. I sent a $40 transaction around 11am paid $3 in fees and it's still stuck at 0 confirmations at 5pm. That's not good enough. Gonna see star wars and it better be confirmed by the time I get home. Just not good enough

Thanks. This is frustrating me and I don't want to create a new thread but, electrum says i have 0.00247715 available which according to google is $41  and even with lowest fee will only let me send max of 0.00147674 which is $25 or so. WTF that is extortion fees.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:26:04
how accurate is that? says 49 blocks same as the lower fee despite upping the fee to .0003 or 88 sat/byte. If it's gonna take 6.5 hours i might as well lower the fee back to .0002?

Doesn't that allow you to spend Bitcoin by converting it to currency accepted by big retailers like any debit card would? Almost like using a debit card in a foreign country?

That would work at shopping for a store but there is a website I make purchases in bitcoin occassionaly that I get 25% discount for doing so. It would just be nice if coin base just went and charged me for missing bitcoin if it's not in my account when i go to pay. That way i'm not stuck with a spare bitcoin in coinbase
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:21:51
That's not exactly what I mean. I just bought something online using bitcoin. In order to do so I copied and pasted the amount i needed to buy into coinbase and then bought that amount before sending it over. What I'm suggesting is that when I try to send more than I have from coinbase is that it automatically buys me extra bitcoin to cover the differential from what's in my wallet before sending it on elsewhere so that I can skip the one step. Or so I can pay for stuff in bitcoin when i want too but, keep my money in the more accepted format up until the point of buying something with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:53:58
OK but is there a way to get the small amount i have left out of there cheaply?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:01:56
Well would it cost less to transfer from coinbase to a local wallet before sending it to a vendor? Or ditch coinbase? I quite frankly don't care about all the technical stuff I just wanted to use Bitcoin because it was a little cheaper
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:02:25
Coinbase and bitpay

It's not really a matter of saving it's a matter of keeping my money in a more convenient form until needed. I understand that most people aren't really buying small amounts of bitcoin but, at least I used to be able to come out ahead if a site offered a 10% discount for bitcoin. I know one site that offers 25% bitcoin discount and even that was close to breaking even the other day. At least the site with the 25% discount uses a processor that uses etherum and other currencies so I just bought ether last time.

May need to do so. Thanks
