Well, what company is going to invest 115 million dollars to take out ASICMINER at this point in the game? It's a high risk investment because they'd be playing serious catchup, against a company that has proven time and time again they have the ability to execute in a rapidly evolving market segment. 
For context, at best we see VC (Venture Cap) funds investing 1-2 million in bitcoin startups here and there. No VC is going to invest 115 million to try and chase a strongly entrenched market leader.
Taking a step back, it's likely that when the eventually competition comes there will certainly be some correction in ASICMINER's valuation. However, we don't know yet what price that will be from, and it certainly won't go to zero, as ASICMINER is growing there hashrate at the same pace as the network is growing. IE: It could correct from 5btc/share to 2.5btc a share. At the moment, ASICMINER. is also the market leader in ASIC systems sold.
You logic is kinda like saying, Some company could come along with a 400 billion dollar IPO and take out Apple.
The most likely scenario will result in 2-3 market leaders owning the space, both from a hardware manufacturing perspective as well as consolidated mining farm perspective. ASICMINER has a very high probability chance of being one of those market leaders, since they already are, and to get there they showed amazing decision making skills and agility. (We're going to see a lot of attrition with these companies that haven't shipped yet.)
