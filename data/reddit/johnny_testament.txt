Hm, if someone manages to create a double-spend, all portions of the multi-hop get involved in some fashion?
Could I say, double spend to myself (Say LegitAccountMe1 spends to ShadyAccountMe2) and then Me2 pays McDonald's for lunch?  I then abandon Me2 and the network reverts funds to Me1 account?
Perhaps that's not any more or less difficult than the same scenario as in Bitcoin as long as security to prevent the double-spend between Me1 and Me2 is the same as it would be on the Bitcoin network.  Is that true?

I wasn't aware of that utility.  What happens if one segment of that transaction is disagreeable and is reverted?
Maybe that term is incorrect?  I think that's the concept if someone finds the transaction unbearable and decides to close a payment channel on the bitcoin layer.

So what is meant by "T1 has now essentially been invalidated"?  It hasn't been posted ever...nothing to invalidate.
What prevents me from posting any previous T1 transaction even after we have both signed T2 if both transactions have been signed...which one wins?  What's the complicated dance?
Additionally, what's preventing me from creating a fake T2 where it looks like I paid you something?  (and getting some material goods)  Presumably, Ta is timelocked and 1btc is returned to each of us at some point.
BTdubs, thanks for time to simplify this stuff.

Upvote for the comment and agree.  Hafta say, it's fricken hard to read, though :)  Bitcoin was slightly hard to get into in 2012 when working examples and a somewhat broad user knowledgebase existed.  LN isn't close to that yet.

So herein lies some of my difficulty understanding the LN system - I'm not using (and not seeing many other people) use terms or detailed concepts from the LN whitepaper.  Are there some simplified definitions of LN terminology?
Are there definitions of LN attack vectors?  Here for example, is it possible to falsely setup the initial Me1 to Me2 channel (Channel1)(broadcast an initial nefarious transaction) and then "doublespend" that same channel? Say Me1 uses the same funds to setup another channel?
