I will try to address some of your questions.
The structure to house the miners is already standing. I am going to renovate part of an unused dwelling that is weather safe and temperature controlled.
* My expenses will be the cost of the miners. Cost of the natural gas power plant. Cost of the power supply for the S7. Cost of electrical wiring for building. Cost of ventilation. I will describe a few of these that I know below
All prices current from amazon - U.S. dollar. July 3rd 2016
* Antminer S7 - 4.73Th/s - 1300watt power draw $599
* Antminer 1600 watt power supply $182.00
* Generac 45,000 watt natural gas generator $11,339.10
  
List of known materials
30ea./ S7 miners - $18,000
30ea./ S7 PSU  -  $5,460
 1ea./ 45,000 watt generator - $11,339.10
I am going to guess for the wiring, stands, software, storage and ventilation an additional $5,000. This is just a guess and may be high.
 taxes and freight an additional $1,500 
** TOTAL - $41,299 **
As stated above, some of these are just an estimate. Just to be safe we can figure an initial investment cost of $50,000.
I am going to speak with the gas company to inform them of my decision to run one of my "homes" power on the natural gas generator to eliminate local utility electric grid cost. As far as my understanding of the contract goes, it is a set price and doesn't fluctuate with usage. This contract will expire when the last living descendant of the original property owner passes away. This is multi-generational and is passed on to the grand children and the children of the grand children as it was explained to me. You guys should see this place.... Gas lamps along the driveway, all gas appliances, gas heat, gas pool heat, gas outdoor lighting. It's a pretty unique situation.
