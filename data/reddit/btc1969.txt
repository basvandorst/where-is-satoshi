The endgame is as a genuine currency, but at the moment it's only used for speculation. Most bitcoin posts are about price, charts, etc. Even the hardcore believers are speculating on price.  
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:18:42
That i true, but people still need to move in/out of the currency. So yes, I could send bitcoin to another country but then I need to convert it in order to buy things. I don't know a single place I can spend bitcoin. Yes, I know there are places, but there's nowhere I want to spend money that takes bitcoin. So I have to use fiat money. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:27:11
I'd be happy to accept payment after I delivered the service. Maybe just build up to a few regular customers. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 15:36:38
Yes, that is indeed an important distinction.
@_date: 2015-12-10 07:58:44
Yes, I agree that is the problem I have at the moment. But that is the problem that needs to be overcome. That you can convert from bitcoin to litecoins doesn't help me at all. I'm not sure what your point is. The point is that to get bitcoins most people need to buy them with fiat currency. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:22:20
I think that's what will happen. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:48:27
Yes, but still doesn't work smoothly. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:45:22
Yes, I agree. The problem is a lot to do with UK laws, as they don't seem suited to crypto currencies. But I don't mean to blame bitcoin for this. What I mean is that it's so difficult to buy that take-up is bound to be hindered. 
Good analogy about the flying car. It's the same with regular banks in the UK these days. You have to show ridiculous things to prove your ID. It gets worse as the years go by. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:16:39
I din't need Flash to run the app, but Flash is needed to verify the ID.
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:04:56
I'll check it out.

It seems to be a sign of the times. Not only do people want to be right, but their beliefs are often so set in stone that they will still maintain that they are right, even when there is overwhelming evidence that they're not. Especially true in American politics. British politics not far behind. Views are getting more polarized than ever before , with much less tolerance for other people's views.
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:42:13
I am not lying. I'll check to see if I installed an imposter app. If I did it was mistake on my part. That doesn't make me a liar. So don't say such ridiculous things. I have nothing to gain by lying. 
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:25:23
Yes, I could sell for USD or other currency and then buy Bitcoin. But I'm thinking of doing BTC only and targeting BTC community. Just want to build up my store of Bitcoin and not spend it. I'm finding it difficult and expensive to buy Bitcoin, so prefer to get Bitcoin directly.
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:29:27
No. Mainly because many sellers say they want extra proof of ID, such as a photo of me holding the ID. Just seems like a security risk giving strangers those sorts of things. I'd prefer not to.
@_date: 2015-12-14 07:34:58
Yes, that's a very good point. Once people start using them they become easier and they may want to try others. On the downside though, once they get used to one of the them and like it, they may just stick with it, as they'd have no reason to change. But there's a long way to go and the game is still wide open.
With Apple for example, it's a strong brand, and people generally like brands. So given the choice of Apple or Bitcoin, I think most would choose Apple. The average person knows, understands and trusts Apple. I don't think that holds true for Bitcoin. The average person probably only knows the horror stories like Mt Gox.
I think many in the Bitcoin make the mistake of thinking Bitcoin will succeed just because it's so great. But the best doesn't always won. Betamax tapes were considered way superior to VHS, but VHS won because it had stronger marketing. The same is true across lots of products. The best often loses to an inferior product from a stronger brand. That is where Bitcoin could lose. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 10:35:40
Many new payment systems work well right way. e.g. Kenya's e-payment system is used by about 90% of the population. Apple's payment system has been a success I think. How can Kenya get 90% of people to use it, but Bitcoin is still in the dark ages by comparison. Agree with the car analogy, but bitcoin is very slow to get up to speed.
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:28:00
You can upload a photo at the first step, which I did, but later it only gave the webcam option. There is no option to upload a photo at that point. I can do again and take a screenshot if you want. The point of it is to show you have the ID with you. A webcam shot proves that, but an uploaded photo doesn't.  
@_date: 2015-12-21 14:28:09
Yes, that's true. But from mid-Jan it's gone from under $200 to around $450 today. When I look at the 1-year chart there is a clear and sustained upturn later in the year. Even 324 to 450 is pretty awesome. Almost 50% rise there alone. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:01:11
But people can't use bitcoin instead of fiat currencies, because 99.999% of people don't have any bitcoins and can't get any. So the point of bitcoin will never become a reality for 99.999% of people. What do I want out of it? Just some speculation at the moment. Maybe more later, but depends how it grows over time.
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:33:09
But that's why I think it may be doomed. There is no demand for a new currency. Also, many of the claimed benefits are easier payment. But e-payments like they have in Kenya are super-easy, so telling them that it's easy to transfer bitcoins is pointless. They already have a currency and payment option. I may be wrong, but the more I think about it, the more I can't think of anyone that it would be useful for as a currency. A store in times of recession, currency collapse in certain countries would make it useful, but a country like USA has no reason to start using it. 
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:00:46
Yes, that would be good though.
@_date: 2015-12-10 07:51:49
I should have been more clear in what I said. I want to buy for pure speculation purposes. As a currency and means of transferring money to another country it's of no use to be. So just want to stash a few away for a rainy day. But the difficulty of buying even one bitcoin makes me think that it will never take off. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:46:56
The above was published shortly after  and seems like it was pretty much copied. All links are the same, except the one to another article on the site. Wording changed and expanded but essentially the same. Probably not a breach of copyright but seems pretty unethical to me.
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:35:41
I bank with a building society, so maybe that's the reason. They are just like a bank, but maybe this subtle distinction means they can't join or don't want to join. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:24:45
You're correct. The problem is buying bitcoin. If people can't buy it easily they won't use it. I want to buy it but am about to give up. I just don't see how 99.99% can be encouraged to use it given my experience. For the vast majority it just makes things more difficult. I was enthusiastic but am now about to give up. Others would give up more easily. I could try another exchange, but who wants to keep uploading ID, taking photos of yourself holding the ID and all that nonsense. It's a massive security risk. Based on my experience I think bitcoin is certain to fail as a currency. It will never have any meaningful amount of uses. Why shop with bitcoin when you can shop with USD? I can transfer money from UK to Asia in one day vi my traditional bank and at an excellent exchange rate. There is no benefit at all to me using bitcoin. Getting in and out is more expansive and 100 times more hassle. Just my experience. I'm sure there are plenty of others like me. And plenty with better experiences.  
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:29:42
But people need to move money in and out, so you'll always have to interface with fiat currency system. The archaic legacy systems work very well for me and for others. Not perfect, but 100 times better than my experience trying to buy bitcoin. Bitcoin won't succeed until it's as easy to buy bitcoin as it is to buy USD. That's a long way off for many in the developed world. I doubt it will ever be possible in less developed countries.
@_date: 2015-12-10 10:33:20
I think I may move to Hong Kong. LOL.
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:14:32
In a way, but fiat to fiat (e.g. GBP to USD) is super easy and cheap. Add bitcoin into the equation and it becomes difficult. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:05:37
No it's not. Suggest you go check.
@_date: 2015-12-10 14:25:24
I just wanted them to hold for speculation purposes. Do I want them that badly? Maybe not. Lots of easier things to speculate on. Even buying a house is easier than buying 1 bitcoin. LOL. By what's the point, I meant the point of bitcoin as a genuine currency. I just can't see that happening any time soon. 
I started off enthusiastic but my bad experiences have taken the enthusiasm away. So I guess that must be the case for others as well. The fact is that many people want many things, but they don't want them so badly that they'd put up with any hassle. 
  
@_date: 2015-12-10 07:54:16
That's obviously not true. If I bought a bitcoin when it was at $1,000, my purchasing power would have halved. What cost 1.0 bitcoin then would costs 2.5 bitcoins now. Increased purchasing power is theoretical but not true in practice. Not at the moment anyway. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:35:00
I don't want to trade face to face. That is truly archaic. And a hassle that I'm not prepared to put up wit. And mega expensive change rates. No thanks. Problem is not with fiat but with bit/bitcoin interface. I can easily exchange my fiat GBP to any other fiat currency and get it to an account in another continent in one day. Super easy. For a UK resident without a bank that uses SEPA it's just not worth the hassle. 
I just wonder how the bitcoin enthusiast (I was one briefly) will persuade others to use it. Most comments here still insist the problem is with fiat not bitcoin. People in general don't care. All they care about is whether the whole process is easy or not. Even if fiat is the problem here, the process of buying bitcoin is still difficult, so it's a non-starter for 99.9999% of people. It's no use to me to know that bitcoi is perfect if it's too difficult to buy.
@_date: 2015-12-05 13:00:26
Try telling that to the guys that had their money at Mt. Gox. I bet they wish they'd bought gold. Property is pretty safe. You can see it standing and it's difficult to steal. Just another alternative.

Well, it's genuine in that sense, but still useless for day to day use. Not a single place online or offline that I use has accept bitcoin. I can't go to local cafe and buy a coffee with it. That makes it useless fro day to day use, even if you bought an airline ticket with. But this will obviously change. It's a start, but take-up is exceedingly slow. Even companies that accept it generally don't see hardly anyone paying with it. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 15:06:23
Some good points there and I hope it works out as planned. I'm sure it will get easier over time, but I still have major doubts.
@_date: 2015-12-31 17:36:39
But companies have now been given licences to trade Bitcoin. No-one that I know of in Thailand is claiming it's illegal. The exchanges are operating with government issued licences.
@_date: 2015-12-05 12:50:06
I bet the banks are already working on blockchain technology similar to bitcoin. I suspect they'll use their own version.
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:15:53
Yes, that's true, but everyone needs to get some to start off. Even though I want to buy some it's almost impossible. Yes, I could use another exchange, but the buy/sell spread is ridiculously high.
@_date: 2015-12-12 16:31:12
It did drop over 12% in a couple of hours. Not sure there's an accurate definition though. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 10:32:08
I think I may give CoinFloor a go. Anyone on here tried them? Coinbase not good for me.
@_date: 2015-12-10 10:32:51
Yes, I think I chose the wrong one. My bank doesn't use SEPA though.
@_date: 2015-12-10 03:25:56
The photo has to be taken with the laptop cam. It takes a photo, I can see it and read it, but it doesn't verify. Taking the photo isn't the problem. It's also a known issue that 1000s have.
You aren't allowed to just take a photo and transfer to your computer. I wish it was that easy. As you say, it's easy, but not allowed.
@_date: 2015-12-10 08:03:28
I have the Coinbase app on my phone. When you go to verify a document it brings up something like Net Verify. At that point it says it needs Flash. If you don't need to verify then you don't need Flash for the app. But it couldn't take a photo of my document because I didn't have Flash installed. That's what it said.
@_date: 2015-12-10 07:55:44
But we live in a world of fiat currencies, so the need is to be able to transfer easily between fiat and crypto. How can I transfer BTC to LTC if I can't buy either of those to begin with?
@_date: 2015-12-11 07:39:10
I think I will go with Bittylicious. Excellent customer support so far, so looks a good bet. About to open account.
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:19:17
Yes, the price will go up or down. Seriously though, I think it's impossible to time these types of purchases perfectly. The price will always go up and down. Better to buy at set time (e.g. monthly) to even out the ups and downs.
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:51:17
How can you tell from that link that it hasn't propagated? And what would usually stop a transaction from propagating?

Regarding 3, you are correct about dollars, as some things could indeed be cheaper next year. In fact I have waited when making a big purchase. For example, I'm ready to buy a condo in Thailand using GBP. Now I'm waiting for a good exchange rate. I also tend to take holidays in NYC when the exchange rate is in my favor but go elsewhere when it's not. So in some ways I do these things.
But I think with Bitcoin it's a totally different scenario. Suppose for example bitcoin is currently worth $400 and I want to buy something from the USA that is on sale for $800. I'd have to spend  $800 (2 BTC) to buy it. But if I though bitcoin price would rise to $800 by July, I could get it for 1 BTC. The price would be unlikely to change from $800. Dollar prices just don't change so suddenly for most things. I think with Bitcoin it can change much more than a currency like USD, GBP, EUR, etc. Within those countries prices tend to be very stable.
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:21:00
Yes, good point. We definitely need some really good companies to help make these sorts of transactions run smoothly. While bitcoin itself is pretty good, the infrastructure around it is still pretty lacking. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:43:59
Those are excellent points you make. I personally think that a huge part of the failings of the world today is that many governments encourage consumption. At the moment in UK property prices are booming due to low interest rates, so people re-mortgage their properties and buy stuff. People feel rich but it's all fake. And it will come back to bite us one day.
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:38:38
If one pool ends up with over 50% then it will show up a flaw in the system. I think it will happen eventually unless changes are made. I guess that introducing higher transaction charges would be the eventual way this plays out. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 14:28:29
Keep more of your money in Bitcoin so that it's easy to transfer urgently. The problem seems to be buying Bitcoin, and NYE is probably not a great time to do that. But I do think that Bitcoin needs some better companies to help us transfer in/out. 
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:30:14
I suppose much will depend on how easy the average person  thinks it is to trade with Bitcoin. If it's too difficult, as it can be for many newbies, then they might stick with what they know. I like the concept though, as the charges at places like eBay are just too much when you add up all the extra costs. 
If it gets off to a good start then it could really take off, which would be awesome for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 01:41:50
I read recently that people spend more of their btc after a steep rise because they feel richer. So that fits in with what you said in 3. above.
