Because Core said so.

It'll never happen because of the loopholes it opens up for the Credit Cards that offer cash back and other rewards. Too many people have burned them too badly doing things like buying "commemorative coins" and such in the past. If they let you essentially buy money on credit, they lose.

BTC One is called BTC. You start with 1 BTC ($2500) and after the fork end up with 1 BTC (say it drops to $2100) and 1 BCC/BCH (say it's selling for $400). But only if you control your own keys or use an exchange that actually gives you access to both chains. You can sell your BCC and buy $400 worth of BTC, leaving you with 1.18 (or whatever) BTC and no BCC and a final value of around $2500. Of course in the meantime BTC could rise or fall, BCC could rise or fall. Nobody can predict the future.

Yes and no: any value BCC has will be removed from BTC by the market, but BTC could be rising in value at the time and more than make up for the loss, making it go up overall around the time of the split.

IANAL but generally not until you convert back to fiat and realize the gains. How long you held, and whether you mined or purchased BTC can also have an effect.

"did I really make 600€ in 5 days without doing anything? Am I missing something? This seems so strange and easy" You took a risk, same as going to a casino and giving the dealer 1730€ and making a few choices that worked out in your factor and then cashing out your chips. You could also have ended up with 1100€ a week later - and if you don't realize that then that's what you're missing.

"Equivalent to 1 day's work at US minimum wage" is not a good metric. As if most people who are working for minimum wage are actually taking all that home and then deciding how to spend it. (That's not generally how that works, most people have bills and living expenses and minimum wage doesn't tend to leave a lot of wiggle room for discretionary spending.)

I suppose. While I don't make minimum wage, I don't live in a world where "picking up an extra shift" is an option. I have a certain amount of disposable income at any given interval, and very little I can do to affect that outside of having a garage sale or something. Sometimes doing something myself is more economical simply because I don't have any ready way of converting my free time into additional money.

That's what I did with my early BTC. Now I have $100 worth instead of $1000 worth, plus a $15 steam game and ~$0 worth of MTGO cards that I paid ~$20 for at the time (which would have turned into $500). Most here would say you're better off buying your food with your fiat debit card and hodling the BTC.
