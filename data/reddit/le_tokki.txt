Always remind them not to invest money that they're not willing to lose. It is the most important thing that anyone should remember when investing in crypto.
Only fools put their money into things that they don't understand.

It should only take a day, as they're just making sure you're using a legit address where someone lives.
and yes, you don't need a bank account to withdraw or deposit, though i suggest you do cause waiting 2 weeks to withdraw is kinda annoying lol.

I use Bitflyer, deposit via konbini or bank.
Konbini takes 2 weeks before you can withdraw to a wallet though. 
For bank verification, it's usually your name, makes sure it's exactly the same as your bank account. This was the only problem I had using them.
