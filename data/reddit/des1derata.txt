He either knows or has access to information that could narrow down who it is. You can just tell in his body language. He got a lil nervous and dodgy about the question. His conscience isn't clear about it. If he truly didn't know or didn't have access, he'd be just fine indulging in a lil speculating and wondering just like everyone else.

To be honest, I don't pay too much attention to the sidebar. I don't really mind it too much, but I can see how it projects on Bitcoin and Bitcoin users a certain identity and stereotype. I think there really is a wide variety of people who are involved, but unfortunately the truth of the matter is that there can't really be an "Official" Bitcoin reddit, because of the nature of Bitcoin.
Unless the moderators/creators decided to give us, the users, some kind of voting or decision-making power to decide what's on the sidebar or how Bitcoin is presented on the sidebar, we're sort of stuck with this subreddit unless one of us or a group of us decide to break off and form another one or do something to pressure the moderators. Which, when you think about it, there's nothing truly stopping someone from doing that. It's just a matter of how much people care to actually get serious about it.

If an easier mechanism for using Bitcoin as an actual currency (a la Paypal or Ripple) or for exchanging it to fiat and back arrives, wouldn't we see the value of Bitcoin temporarily drop as people begin to use it more?
I'm also betting that the value is going to go down in the short term, but outside of the scenario I've mentioned above, I can't really see a situation in which the value would drop and then go back up.
Maybe another scenario would be Ripple opening up and people trading in their Bitcoins for XRP?
@_date: 2013-05-22 20:03:09




Because Bitcoin opens the door for free association, for people to work for and pay for things solely in Bitcoin, relatively paperlessly and almost tracelessly, without needing to pay taxes on the transactions.
If I get hired right now to work for someone in exchange for Bitcoin, doesn't that allow us to circumvent certain taxes and employee regulations? Also, imagine I now use those Bitcoins to go purchase commodities, solely in Bitcoin. Doesn't that also allow circumvention (if not at least open the door), for bypassing of sales taxes and commodity taxes?
Nation-states are historically very anal about taxes, which is why they tend to produce their own currencies and establish their own central banks.
In light of this, unless a nation-state had somewhat total control/surveillance over Bitcoin or whatever digital currency that becomes mainstream (meaning, no anonymity and all transactions logged/checked), I can't imagine it not being deemed a threat.

I really think you're missing my point entirely. I don't care about Bitcoin funneling back into the "anarchist" cause or the "libertarian" cause or whatever. My central claim in the above posts is that Bitcoin is political, like it or not. It changes politics. It changes how decisions are made and wealth is transferred. It empowers **everyone** to get in on that and bypass certain obstacles. I'm all for people being empowered, I don't care if it adheres to any ideology.
@_date: 2013-05-14 22:44:44
Based on the Ripple protocol, it seems like it's pretty counter-intuitive to hoard XRP rather than use it or share it. Isn't the whole point of Ripple to enable everyone to make quick transactions and exchanges? If we all want that then it seems like eventually we'll just be tossing XRPs around like pennies. There's plenty of other ways to make transactions that would be much cheaper, even if they do take a longer period of time. It's not like you'd be paying extra to use Ripple for anonymity. Ripple doesn't have anonymity. It's main benefit is in acting as an exchange between different forms of currencies (real or virtual) and in speed.
Then again, perhaps somewhere in what I said is precisely the point to why it's being valued so highly already. I just think that unless we want to keep the idea of Ripple a luxury for those who are willing to pay that much, the price is going to drop to practically a penny. Maybe all the more reason to make a quick buck now before that happens? Maybe the "overvaluation" is all part of Ripples "coming out" phase like an IPO, it's proof of value? If the price doesn't drop, someone else will come up with a better, cheaper protocol or a truly decentralized p2p. If we want virtual currency to be the future and become mainstream, either of the three is going to have to happen.

But like I said, doesn't Bitcoin open the door for "under-the-table"/untaxed labor transactions to become more ubiquitous and easier done?
For example, the problem with freelancing or doing work "under-the-table" prior to the Digital Age is that you had to **trust** the person you were making a private deal or contract with. They could end up screwing you, paying less than what you agreed to, or report you to the authorities and backstab you.
With Bitcoin and escrow services, the problem of trust is taken care of. You don't have to actually meet or necessarily trust the person. All you have to do is trust the protocol. So, you and I could make an agreement where I'll set up a website for you and you'll pay me in BTC and we both live on different continents. Without Bitcoin, you could easily screw me over and never send the money, disappear, etc. With Bitcoin and escrow services, I **trust** that the money is coming if I do the performed work because I trust the protocol. On top of that, the transactions can happen quickly, relatively cheaply, and we never have to meet. This makes freelancing, contract and "under-the-table" work much easier to do.

In light of the NSA shenanigans that've been recently exposed...along with the last line in the article:


It sounds like they're going to try and go after anyone who uses Bitcoin using network surveillance. I want to be wrong, but it sure sounds like they're equating the very usage of non-state sanctioned virtual currencies with tax fraud/evasion/criminality.

I'm not sure what you're getting at here. First you give me trouble about suggesting that Bitcoin could be anarchist and is political, then you ask me if I think it's democratic??
Maybe we're throwing around different senses of the political. Yes, I think it's democratic, libertarian, anarchist, etc. Not as a means to gain "democracy" or build the libertarian party or the anarchist movement, but in the adjective sense of how it works, the process of it. It requires consensus, it's created from the bottom up by people who believe in it, it's not forced on anyone, it's entirely voluntaryist, there are no internal authoritarian hurdles to get involved, trade it, help develop it, or create applications for it (aside from government/banking external regulations and laws). It's created by people for people to make things more efficient, better, etc.
@_date: 2013-03-19 21:56:12
Dude. It's ok. Look, this guy truly took a gamble. What he reaps in profit will be purely from believing and being willing to take the risk as an early-adopter. He's going to earn it solely from that. In all likelihood, it could have turned out pretty badly instead.
You're right, now it has gained some legitimacy and if you hop on the train now, you're not going to really gain as much as you could have.
The truth is, you should be looking for the next crypto-technology or crypto-currency to invest in. Maybe Litecoin or Mega. The problem is, whatever it is will be just as heavily scrutinized and doubted as when Bitcoin came about. That's the catch, that's always the catch. You have to go with what you believe will be the next thing, because in the end that's all you have to go on since it could end up not working out.

Perhaps. I'm not necessarily taking the argument that far, though I would argue the Bitcoin protocol can empower people to have control over the wealth and value they create.
The similarity is that the politics is in the protocol. So, while it may seem from a birds-eye view that Bitcoin is apolitical, when you look at it up close and how it works, it actually is implicitly political in subtle ways.

When I was active as an anarchist/radical organizer, we had a saying about the way we would organize, make decisions, and run our meetings (which was using a consensus decision-making protocol, way before Occupy made it the "cool" thing to do): **the politics is in the process**.
People would be at a loss to understand what was so "anarchist" about what we did and how we organized, because we weren't embodying all the stereotypes of anarchists today or running around breaking windows. We were actually trying to get shit done and empower people to run their own lives.
For better or for worse, it's the same situation with Bitcoin. **The politics is in the protocol**. Viva la Bitcoin!

I don't see how a protocol like Bitcoin could survive in that kind of climate, unless it was a completely controlled and centralized digital currency made specifically by the government.
How could you have all of the above without total control over all aspects of the economy (including all economic transactions)?

True, but consensus decision-making protocol is flexible. While OWS may have stuck to a 100% agreement version of consensus, the protocol actually allows you to consent to different methods of reaching agreement. That's kinda the point of it being called consensus.
In other words, a group can consent on a 51% majority rules method of voting. At anytime, the 49% can decide to form another group and do things how they want to. They're not stuck with accepting the 51% majority rule they previously agreed to if a decision is made that they realllyyy aren't cool with. The concept of free association and consensus need to go hand-in-hand to work (which is arguably part of the reason why the protocol broke down for OWS, the strict adherence to 100% pushed everyone to be all or nothing about making decisions).
So, applied to Bitcoin, consent is implied for everyone who mines, runs a node, or trades with Bitcoin. You are implicitly accepting the protocol as it is, with the 51% democratic process built into it. At any time you could decide, if you so chose, to use another protocol or build your own, but no one is forcing you to use it. It is all voluntary, ie. anarchist, libertarian, voluntaryist, etc.
