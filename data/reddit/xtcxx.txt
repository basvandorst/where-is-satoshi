Most would argue Gresham's Law would place gold as beneficiary in that case but I'd agree its likely to favour a variety of alternatives to any failing standard
Government force is applied in most western markets.
  If you think we are living in a capitalist free market and government is not interfering to fix prices at various levels for self sufficiency on their debt and ongoing deficits; I will stop there because any further argument is pointless

So does being a node give any chance of getting payment share like a POS coin does staking

This an instrument similar to many other commodity containers.   Typically they want to buy these on days with big news then sell it for a profit, they arent long term holders so this fee is not important.
Also trading like this is more tax efficent for them as they would pay fees on actual holdings like stamp duty for shares is very expensive for a day trader

Well this is easy really, cryptsy has royalty shares and she can have 50% or more of his owning of those.

Hate to say it but I used BTC tons 5 years ago in a few places useful to me and they stopped or the company went offline so its not a given MS continues.

Yes moving coins is transferring.    You can move money between bank accounts also, I do that all the time and it also counts as money transferred.
If there was a way to move coins purely on your own machine, your argument would have merit

The lesson there is its possible to be king for a day in cutting edge of tech but to stay at the top requires innovation and to recognise then address your audience especially in any growth avenues.

Arent all these forks supposed to address this.   Segwit or Lightning network because it is a problem, little guy always counts in a real economy

BTC cannot replace gold because its intrinsically different.   Gold is a unique element, large part of why its kept its place for millennia and will likely continue.
Dollars have no proper backing, a promise that will fail and people speculate when that is.    The replacement for Dollar now is going to be a IMF fiat standard again with tiny bits of gold.

I wouldnt call it an attack but its a short cut and some say unfair.   The overall effect of every block being empty would be like an attack, depends how far this thing goes or if its self adjusting and if that scenario is not possible

Tesla is a depreciating asset but a house may reduce your costs.  I would view these two very differently though they are both assets, the car less so
There is a number of working projects you could diversify into.  One Ive been following a year is entering esports, I like its prospects but look around and decide for yourself.
I also know of a site which pays 4% interest daily, again a long term company this time going back years.   Let me know if you dont find anything especially interesting in crypto but theres definitely growth available.    Lastly I would also hold at least 1% in gold, as a simple hedge but thats my personal take as I believe $ is at a high now.
I also found an old account from 2014, everyone should check out the big sites in case they left a balance spare.  My find was 1/100th of this though just change I left, still nice to find but I wonder how old must your wallet have been wow :D

Thanks for the tip, useful info.   
So the segwit balance shows in bitcoin QT but will it show if more payments are sent to that segwit address in future.   Can I reuse that old segwit address again after its been imported.   Repeat rescan or is the segwit address not even valid now ( I presume not)

I do wonder if the general public will ever use LN in this way.    That doesnt make LN a failure, its just the general public needs the equivalent of a 'TV remote control' type device to address any complex system.   Thats secondary to the base workings being correct or not, it is important to long term success

The original US constitution specified gold standard (and silver) as the only viable currency in USA but apparently that idea is up for debate to such an extent we have zero relation to any standard of value

The idea of capitalism and its corruption is that its competitive not that human flaws dissolve away but that someone will always try to beat you, means society benefits from no one sitting at the top easily.
Unlike military dictatorships under the barrel of a gun

@_date: 2018-04-16 01:24:38
Thats more likely to occur with gold because its been true in the past as a backing many national FIAT currencies.    Bitcoin will be just one of many better alternatives to USD and even that is a great feat and means its accumulated much value.

Total noob here, is USAF going to be a switch in BTC protocol (and we'll all update) if enough miners back it or will mean we end up with a different traded crypto standard
or does nobody know yet.  Just wondering how disruptive all this might be

I did get this working with Core QT but its a massive install.  I'm unsure if the segwit address is now tied to that QT wallet or can I sweep it into greenbits app on my phone perhaps.  Im unclear if that works or not, I asked the sender to just send direct to the greenbits segwit address but unfortunately payment details is not editable by me
I would guess its not going to be that easy and I will need to start over and redownload the whole Core download.  Hopefully I can repeat the process and rescan

Why cant we choose which part of the network to use within the overall bitcoin framework. 
Do we really want to be tied to the views of a few dozen people in a country far away not related to us.
   This seems similar to US Dollar and its bias to Washington politics, it doesnt even serve USA nevermind the wider world as a global reserve currency.    Who are the bitcoin elite serving. 
  We are repeating mistakes of FIAT instead of harnessing technology, or are we going to find our own way?
