could be Satoshi dice going up and down and BTC dice being down.  The two of them are responsible for a huge number of daily transactions.  Daily transactions are way down:  .

and when your friends no longer want to socialize with you because you only pay them back in this cryptocurrency they have no idea how to use, you'll know you've succeeded.

I'm sure they're going to send his looper after him and this thread will just disappear. 
@_date: 2012-12-20 21:21:53
I'm convinced it's the satoshi dice page with the direct bet links on there.
@_date: 2012-10-24 17:55:56
Kudos on this.  The best advanced explanation I've read that doesn't require you to be a programmer to understand.
@_date: 2012-10-10 23:07:20
This is going to be to their detriment in the long haul.
@_date: 2012-11-26 20:37:36
This works but is slow because some Austrian guy who works only 5 hours a week has to manually approve each bitcoin withdrawal.

To bring "forever alone" to a bold new level.

Not sure if there are other satoshi dice players, but receiving double spends seems to be a more frequently occurring problem.  It's to the point where I don't think I'll be using their site any more.

Did anyone else raise an eyebrow at the elephant clipart?

This has been your experience in practice?  I'm at level 3 and have done 16 transactions for 90 coins total and I still wait up to 2 days for each time which is very frequently through an entire one of their (Austrian) business days, thus my tongue in cheek comment.  The only thing I like about Virwox is that I don't have to leave the house to fund it, but considering the double commission fees (USD-&gt;SLL &amp; SLL-&gt;BTC) and .02 BTC handling fee you pay the wait for a nebulous "manual step" is rather jarring.

I'm putting my Btc on this being the case.

And what am I going to do for the 200 years I am cryogenically frozen now?

we call him "the bitcoin troll"
@_date: 2012-11-23 22:09:16
Thank you for clarifying that.  I thought $20 million was a lot to pay for a baby elephant.  I know the market is dwindling but I only paid like 50 grand for my last one.
@_date: 2012-12-30 22:51:57


Extrapolating on that, we now understand why you didn't complete your acquisition of 100 coins.

Time for a game of kick the troll.

I clearly think [Tide Laundry Detergent]( is the way to go on this one.

If you're on here I'm going to guess there's a fairly good chance you're not a religious individual. You should know the anonymous programs are thinly veiled [religious programs]( that only have a 5% success rate.
If you are looking to get help with a gambling or any other program I would suggest looking into the secular [SMART recovery program.](  )
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:10:42
I think you're confusing two things here, sellers taking BTC as payment for their auctions and Paypal acting as a useless intermediary and taking a commission to do it.  It's the latter I have a problem with.
@_date: 2013-05-05 06:04:32

I'm not sure this is what the other OP had in mind when he said we should encourage charities to accept the coin.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say at least 1/2 of them are redditors.

Someone needs to convince Sen. Chuck Schumer of this.  I can't be the only one upset he's not being pragmatic on this issue.

You sound a little wound up, maybe it's time you started doing drugs?

Fuck them.  My paypal account was shutoff for BTC buying/selling months ago and now they want to hop on the bandwagon?
@_date: 2013-05-01 10:41:33
PayPal is going to provide the same great enhancements to BitCoin that America Online did for the Internet.

How much would you like to bet the commission is going to be the same as credit cards even though they have no need to pay Visa / MC ?

Why is it I think the jackoffs at paypal are not going to take nicely to BTC auction payments?

I'm starting to think he chose San Francisco because of the likelihood the jury would acquit.

They got rid of the "biggest losses" tab.  I guess they found that wasn't too good for business.

MtGox had a $30.28 last when I posted this, I'm a little perplexed now.
