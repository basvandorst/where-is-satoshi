One troll post makes the sub weird? Down vote him. Easy peasy

Yea, like 48 whole hours to flip a coin for their two options.... I can't tell if you're joking. lol

ship is gonna be pushed back with all the buy orders.
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:58:05
It is most definitely right.

\*MOVIE SPOILER\* There is a movie called "the perfect storm". At the end of the movie they try to go over a massive wave and when they get to the very top, they don't make it and the wave comes crashing down and kills them all.
In this context, i assume OP is saying that we won't go much lower on price, because the wave of buy orders will overwhelm sell orders, causing the buy order wave to push the price back up. (Like the boat being pushed back by the wave.)

I don't think I'll take the advice of someone who cant even spell "advice". Also, its obvious that you're trolling to get people to respond to you. Do you need a friend? I can be your friend.

dont feed the trolls

Youre forgetting the part where they own a shit ton of BCH. And BCH's success is worth WAY more to them than current mining revenue. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 22:59:23
There is no reason for you to be so aggressive. There is also no reason for you to name call. There is also no reason for you to tell me you're going to block me.
You used to word "argument". I'm not arguing with you. Simply trying to point out that not everything is 'black and white'. Many variables to mining. 
Have a nice day.

Not trying to be mean. Just asking nicely. Are you autistic?

You're right, I mentioned infinite hash rate. 
Yes, in this theoretical scenario, if bitcoin were 1 billion a coin. Every person with a computer that could mine, would mine. At some point hardware starts to become more valuable. Which brings us back to the mining market plays a role in the price of a coin, in my opinion. 
Its ok if that isn't your opinion. but try to remember that its simply your opinion. 
No need to get aggressive or name call. Have a nice day. 
Also, I'll say again. I'm not a troll. And I'm also more educated than you might think. ;)

"If the mining cost per coin becomes more expensive, coin value will increase as a consequence."
This makes perfect sense when more miners are constantly being added, increasing the difficulty. Less coins per miner. Miners wont sell at a loss. Price goes up.

tl;dr Sold .3 bitcoin to company that had "cryptocurrency" in the name. 
I want my time back. This is like me saying I went and bought ice cream at an ice cream shop. I don't think there has ever been a more appropriate time to use... 
COOL STORY BRO.

bad winter frost is temporary. bitcoin halving is permanent. you are not very smart. Stop typing. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 13:41:28
I feel bad for you. :( 
And I will have a good life. ;) 
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:53:07
I know about difficulty adjustments. This is a chicken or egg scenario. Does the coin market drive the mining market. Or does the mining market drive the coin market. Not trolling. And with all due respect, i dont give a fuck if you block me. just trying to have a dialogue and learn.

"in case of the former" 
Youre gonna have to be more descriptive there, bud. 
@_date: 2018-07-24 07:14:16
Hello friend. I'm not talking about short term. I'm talking about long term. In the distant future bitcoin will most definitely cost more than 20k to mine. It's built into bitcoins code to cut the reward in half every couple years. Will happen again in 2020.
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:56:19
Ok. Tell me why you don't think a bitcoin will cost 20k to mine in 2050?
Maybe instead of telling me i dont understand, just answer the question in the first place?  Unless of course youre the one who has no clue what youre talking about. ;) Your comment doesn't help anyone.
@_date: 2018-07-25 13:57:08
Explain. Because I don't see a world where bitcoin costs 5k to mine, but is worth 100k.
@_date: 2018-07-24 06:57:49
So tell me. What happens when bitcoin costs more than 20k to mine 1 bitcoin?
It will either go above 20k or go to 0. Apparently you think bitcoin will disappear. Good luck with your future regret.

" Obviously, this makes no sense! Economically rationale miners would of course switch on their miners to make a profit. This will increase global hash power. This increases mining difficulty. This increases the electricity cost per mined coin. "
There is not an infinite hashrate. At some point in your scenario, all miners will be on. A cost to mine will be static.
