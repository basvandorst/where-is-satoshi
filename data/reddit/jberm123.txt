In your first sentence, what economic slow downs are you referring to?
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:53:01
Assume the mempool is filled with tx's with fees ranging between .00001 and 1 BTC
~~You will change the validity rules to say that the only valid blockchain is the one where tx's submitted with fees higher than 1 BTC are included?~~
Edit: let me think more on this
Edit 2:
The validity rules change to say any tx’s included in the mempool that are higher than the current max fee (1 BTC) must be included in the next block
The attacker mines this chain, absorbing all the high fees. The attacker can continue filling the mempool pushing up the upper bound of tx fees until no one can afford the fee
Edit 3: I also ignored the more important fact that you won’t even be able to ensure mempools are in sync to safely enforce the rule in the first place. Meaning any time you broadcast a tx to be placed in the mempool, the attacker can just as easily add tx’s to the mempool in immediate response and no one else on the network can definitively know which actually came first
... the 51% assumption is simply fundamental to Bitcoin. It's Bitcoin's chief innovation. It's strange to me someone with the knowledge you seem to have on Bitcoin refuses to accept this (and the same goes for Andreas)
Edit 4: regarding my 3rd edit... you simply can’t trust any ordering rules governed via the mempool. Proof of work is the solution to give you trust in transaction ordering. You can’t rely on everyone having a copy of all transactions in the mempool
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:22:32


Yes they can, just because the difficulty adjusts doesn’t mean they don’t still have 51% of the total compute power mining bitcoin (unless more miners join in, which seems unlikely)


So if you assume the government couldn’t do this covertly (i.e. if everyone knows the attack is being carried out), yes, you seem to allude to the fact that the defense against this would be to hard fork to a new hashing algorithm, rendering the attacker’s ASIC’s worthless. But now all bitcoin mining rigs are worthless too. Who do you think is better positioned at this point: the government with extremely deep pockets willing to 51% attack the network, or new miners who need to invest in new mining equipment in the face of that threat
So ya, you’re right, it may cost more than $12mn/day after the initial capital investment, but I’d still wager if the government was willing to make the initial capital investment, they’d be willing to sustain the attack with more capital
@_date: 2019-11-29 16:15:53
It’s not easily detectable. No one else will know which txs are the attacker’s and which are honest. Only you will see that your txs continue to be excluded


Can you explain this more? I don’t know what this means


Assumes you’ll know which txs are honest and which aren’t to reconstruct a new chain, which isn’t possible
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:10:19
Like the commenter I responded to said, Bitcoin’s innovative consensus mechanism relies on the assumption that computational power trumps everything else. Their chain will win out because of this
Edit: lol how does this get downvoted in the bitcoin subreddit. Read the white paper
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:52:49
Because it's not true. See [this comment](
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:43:07
Ok, thanks for all your help
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:25:52
They can get all the fees no matter how high they are because they have the highest hash rate. They can arbitrarily include txs with really high fees that no one else can reliably tell are theirs.
The Lightning Network relies on Bitcoin’s blockchain for settlement.
Edit: Plus, they can launch the attack until fees are so high no one else can use it either. Their only loss to sustain this attack would be electricity costs
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:07:15
To be honest, this is the most disappointingly incorrect stuff I've ever heard Andreas say.
I think you even give him too much credit. I definitely think the US government has the ability to pull off a covert operation to take over Bitcoin.
The hardware cost of a 51% attack today is [~$17.5bn]( The US gov is easily capable of spending (printing) at least 5x that much cash to take Bitcoin down by censoring all tx's with a sustained 51% attack. Even if you assume the US gov couldn't covertly purchase enough S9's to pull off the attack and the hardware cost would actually be much higher than $17.5bn, it's trivial to assume that with $100bn the US gov could manufacture their own chips
@_date: 2019-11-30 03:51:28
Ah so only they can be the only miners of this new chain and/or be in charge of determining who can mine on their chain? Your solution now is centralization
Edit: removed the meanness. Sorry for being a dick
@_date: 2019-11-29 18:13:14


Your assumptions guiding your points/provided solution are wrong, so I can start there. Besides, I did some googling and don't see how fraud proofs/"weak blocks" that p2pool uses can fit neatly into this argument. You just cited them without explaining how it fits, hence my lack of understanding...


It's detectable that a 51% attack may be occurring. What I meant is that it's not detectable which txs are honest and which are not. For every "honest" tx, the attacker can fill the mempool with 10 fake tx's that look just as honest to the rest of the network
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:02:33
I think the gov could find a way to come up with $100bn without devaluing the dollar, which is way more than enough to sustain the attack
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:27:27
Agreed. Just a little shocking to hear it after hearing so much right from him for so long
To your btw point, meh, sure, maybe it couldn’t be pulled off covertly. Not like it really matters if it’s covert or not though
@_date: 2019-11-30 04:31:57
Ya, everyone can decide to use a centralized blockchain mined by a coalition of miners they trust. Or Venmo
@_date: 2019-11-24 23:55:06


That relies on the assumption of an honest majority.


Dishonest miner acquires 1 BTC. Dishonest miner uses coinjoin to spread the BTC across a bunch of new addresses the miner has the keys to. Dishonest miner starts mining blocks only filled with tx’s from these addresses to new addresses the miner has the keys to with fees higher than the rest of the network.
What validity rules would catch this censorship and prevent it from occurring trustlessly?


You can’t claim they’re possible if you can’t demonstrate how they’d work haha
Edit: I don’t even think the miner needs to include tx’s with high fees. Show exactly how your bitcoin node can trustlessly differentiate between the dishonest miner’s blockchain and the honest one even if the dishonest miner just includes tx’s with normal fees
@_date: 2019-11-21 14:45:03
Accumulate a bunch of Bitcoin, fill blocks with wash trades with fees slightly higher than the rest of the market is willing to pay, continue mining on your own chain... Bitcoin could not withstand a sustained 51% attacker with deep pockets
@_date: 2019-11-21 14:19:36
Pretty easy to see how the US government might view Bitcoin as a legitimate threat to the US dollar... no?
Besides, Andreas is arguing against the feasibility of the attack assuming the government wants to do it. Whether or not it's a waste is a separate topic
@_date: 2019-11-22 11:37:20
I can’t tell if this was sarcasm or not
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:04:24
How will you reliably construct a list of miners everyone agrees are honest that the dishonest miners couldn’t thwart
Your last point is an assumption, not a guarantee of what might occur. Why would more miners be incentivized to mine in the face of Bitcoin’s largest threat?
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:59:51
The cost to sustain this attack is electricity (currently $12mn/day)
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:50:27
Also for context: the Fed, the institution in charge of ensuring the dollar is up to snuff, prints 10’s of billions a day
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:16:37
The attacker can flood the mempool with tx's with fees all over the place
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:45:03
Borderline unlimited... the attacker is a government
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:15:12
[~$17.5bn]( in hardware cost + $12mn/day in electricity. Hardware cost might even be less expensive in reality considering the attacker would likely find a way to manufacture the hardware themselves at lower cost than the market price used in the calculation
Agreed this cost is still quite low if you assume the attacker is the US gov for example as is done in the video
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:17:50
A loss of $12mn/day in electricity costs... an infinitesimal drop in the bucket for the US gov
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:45:40
I’m not a bitcoin detractor, I don’t think Bitcoin is comparable to Dutch tulips for similar reasons you mentioned (it’s actually a technologically innovative invention). I think bitcoin is here to stay
I’m just saying a detractor might not necessarily think the world will just “forget” about Bitcoin. I’ve heard detractors mention bitcoin is the “bubble of all bubbles” for example, also inferring it will be taught in history for years to come
All this to say bitcoin is widely recognized across the spectrum (from believers to detractors alike) as something significant that won’t just be forgotten
In my opinion, the question that remains still is if it will become the default form of currency. I’d consider it “a success” at that point. I think we’re on the way, have made lots of progress toward that aim (enough to say bitcoin is clearly doing extremely well), and this photo is a powerful sign of progress toward that aim, but we’re not there yet
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:18:38
I agree this photo is a powerful/important sign for Bitcoin, but I think you’re strawmanning the detractor argument. I don’t think detractors think the world will just “forget” about Bitcoin, the same way the world hasn’t forgotten about Dutch tulips

You ignorantly tied Bitcoin's "cool" and innovative properties to the reference client's language. The point is that has no relevance to Bitcoin's innovative characteristics under the hood. It can be written in any language and has already been written [in a bunch](
@_date: 2019-12-10 03:25:33
[Here]( ya go
Edit: this is a completely illogical debate regardless. Let's assume the only client available is the C++ reference client. Your point is that the client is destined to fail some day because of POTENTIAL catastrophic memory management that has yet to materialize since Bitcoin's inception, even though Bitcoin has been operating at or near capacity [the past 3 years](  Completely illogical

Lmao the white paper is the backbone of bitcoin...
Here's [another rust client]( with a commit from yesterday
And again, you haven't even made a good point as to why Bitcoin will fail with C++ as its backbone regardless. By your logic, all software not written in Rust will fail in the future. Looks like Linux (oh and Facebook itself) is fucked
@_date: 2019-12-09 23:47:20


Of all the things wrong with your comment, this is the most hilarious. [This]( might blow your socks off
Edit: For posterity, here’s my best summary of the person’s deleted comments (giving him the benefit of the doubt in my interpretation):
Bitcoin will fail because the reference client is written in C++ and it’s *hard* to write good scalable code in languages derived from C compared to memory-safe languages like Rust (and the Bitcoin core devs/Bitcoin coding community are incapable of writing good scalable code). The fact that there are multiple functioning clients in other languages including Rust means nothing to this person because the C++ reference client is "the backbone of Bitcoin".
Bitcoin will also fail because it's unregulated, isn't backed by a corporation, and doesn't have a CEO or board of directors. It'll fail because it's literally exactly what it was meant to be: a system not controlled by centralized parties
Bitcoin has no principles nor guiding vision nor a community rallied around a purpose. The singular aim to build a secure p2p currency uncontrollable by centralized parties doesn’t cut it for this person
Also the person believes Libra will beat out Bitcoin in the end because it has the above properties
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:38:38


Yes, that’s that exactly what this is showing


So you’re saying there’s a factor today that people are likely more willing to purchase bitcoin today so that they can spend it. This supports the strength of the statistic because there’s stronger reason to believe it’s real economic growth driving it rather than speculative trading
@_date: 2017-09-14 07:30:46
The market for gpu's is easily in the billions, so I'll assume you're referring to the current niche market for bitcoin asic's (which makes sense the $2.7bn figure assumes S5+ asic's). I'm not an electrical engineer nor have I mined Bitcoin before I'll admit, but I find it hard to believe it's infeasible to reverse engineer [these parts]( and pay billions to purchase the components that go into them. Maybe that's wrong and I'd like to be corrected on that if I am.
Regardless, I'll roll with your hypothetical: the PROC broadcasts its intention to launch a 51% attack and seizes control of Chinese miners. In your hypothetical, we'll just assume the Bitcoin network can immediately come to a consensus on a POW change, meaning the hashing algorithm would change. Thus rendering all asic's obsolete. Now who become the new miners and how secure is the new Bitcoin network? You really think miners would be incentivized to spend millions developing and manufacturing new asic's with a proven threat of a 51% attack? The new miners would likely be gpu miners. What's to stop the government from having gpu's prepared for that inevitability too? I imagine this fallout would be catastrophic and would cripple Bitcoin's future.
The reason governments have not stopped Bitcoin in the last 8 years is because to them, it has not had too substantial of a negative impact on society that warrants millions (4 years ago) to billions (since asic's) in response. I would hope it stays that way until the network is resilient enough that the cost actually does become infeasible, though I don't think it's there yet.
Edit: Satoshi was worried about wikileaks accepting Bitcoin since it might provoke government response. Do you think Satoshi was wrong to be worried?
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:55:40
In response to your questions, it actually is technically possible for a government to cripple the Bitcoin network today. One such method: a central power could expend enough on mining equipment in order to gain 51% of the hashing power on the network. The central power could then effectively choose which transactions to include in the Bitcoin blockchain. [This would only cost an estimated $2.7 bn today]( a relatively small amount to the US government alone. JP Morgan itself could also do this if it wanted the company has more than enough cash.
I think the counterarguments are that eventually Bitcoin will be pervasive enough (meaning there will be enough miners) that this cost will exceed a realistic figure, and governments are too inefficient to do this today, but the fact remains that it's technically possible to do today.
Torrenting also doesn't rely on byzantine fault tolerance; it's not a trustless protocol to achieve consensus like Bitcoin is. I don't think it's fair to say that because the government can't shut down torrenting, the government can't shut down Bitcoin simply because they're both peer to peer networks.

I think I mischaracterized your argument.
I assumed you thought that QE necessitates more QE in the future or otherwise causes a bleak ending. You don’t believe that? You think the US could safely avoid doing QE in the future
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:39:36
What I’m trying to wrap my head around is what indicators would you use to say that since the US did 3 rounds of QE, real economic activity is down?
Corporate earnings are up, unemployment is down, GDP growth has remained positive (not great, but certainly not down)
I get the argument that QE likely caused malinvestment and inflated asset bubbles, but I don’t see indicators that support that across the US economy. Even in the stock market for example, P/E ratios seem historically normal because earnings are also up in relation to prices
And separate question, how can you disprove the argument that QE kept the US economic engine going (and that the engine would have failed without it)?
@_date: 2019-09-13 15:49:21


This isn’t true in the US. The yield curve was relatively flat but still normal before the trade war


I acknowledged we’ve had slow growth. No, slow growth doesn’t convince me collapse is inevitable


I don’t see this as a good sign, but again, nothing suggests it will lead to economic collapse


The timing of the fed ending the tightening cycle coincides with the ramp up of the trade war


I’m not advocating for more QE, even if the trade war makes things bad, even if we go into recession as a result. I’m saying it’s plausible the last round of QE prevented economic collapse and there’s no evidence to suggest that the collapse it prevented is inevitable today
@_date: 2019-09-13 02:45:33
Your analogy now assumes collapse is inevitable in the US (we did QE to prevent collapse 8 years ago therefore it was just delayed). Once again there’s no evidence to support this. The economy was doing completely fine until the trade war, which would obviously have a deeply negative impact on the economy.
Again, sure, some companies that should have died had their death delayed. But what evidence is there that suggests the economy didn’t end up healing on its own? What evidence is there to suggest “economic collapse” that QE delayed is now inevitable? I mean thousands of companies have died since the last round of QE, you don’t consider that healing?
I think we’ve hit a wall in the discussion
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:47:50
Satoshi inscribed the bank bailout newspaper headline into the genesis block to show that bitcoin is the alternative. It kind of is the main topic, it’s the only reason bitcoin exists
@_date: 2019-09-13 23:49:46


The trade war


Japan's program isn't in place to prevent economic collapse. Their program is meant to try and jump start their economy ad infinitum


This is interesting. This is the first time I'm getting exposed to this ratio. I agree this could be used as evidence stocks are overvalued and were overvalued prior to the trade war. I need to think about this more


trade war


Leverage ratios appear [pretty healthy to me](


Can you show me what you're looking at to determine this?


The claim I'm focusing on is whether economic collapse was prevented or delayed by QE in the US. Not whether or not we're following Japan's path
@_date: 2019-09-12 20:38:04
These are the factors I was curious about. I understand the Austrian axiomatic arguments


I guess you could say artificially cheaper debt would keep companies such as this alive to this point, but assume the Fed just ceased to exist today. Companies such as this would eventually die off. This wouldn’t necessarily lead to a “bleak ending.” I don’t know what evidence exists that proves that


Yes unfunded pension liabilities agreed are a big problem. Hard to say QE is the direct cause of this problem rather than horrendous allocation of capital especially by the government. In other words, this would likely still be a problem without QE (even if made worse by QE)


Don’t see how QE necessarily caused this either. Would still be a problem without QE (even if made worse by QE)


Again, sure, QE could have caused this on a certain scale. But to the scale of “bleak ending” spelling catastrophe for the economy, I’m not so sure
And one could argue the benefits of QE in saving the economy from an extremely painful slowdown, enabling the economy to pick up again on its own 2 feet sounds like a plausible scenario, no? I still don’t see any evidence that suggests that’s not the case
The best argument I feel that’s provably reasonable against QE is the fairness aspect. It unfairly benefits banks and the wealthy before everyone else
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:39:41
If the US doesn’t do more QE starting today, what makes you think it’s headed to a bleak ending due to malinvestment and centralized control of the economy? What factors can you point to that support that?
