Well I don't accept any of the arguments that you say are easy because that's a subjective judgment. You could be right or you could be wrong. I really don't think you can know unless you're talking about a personal preference on your part. Again...subjective.
I think you really are not understanding me because you keep referring to a decimal point. I'm questioning why anyone would use a decimal point at all. I'm not talking about putting a bunch of zeros in front of anything. I'm just talking about moving the decimal point to the very end of the unit expression at any level of divisibility.
So of one btc is 100M units, a Satoshi is reffered to as 1 rather than 0.00000001 and that if a Bitcoin if further divided to 1 billion units, that a Satoshi still refer to 1 rather than 0.000000001
I don't see why you think I'm stuck on putting a bunch of zeroes before anything.
What am I not clearly defining about what happens when we further divide? I called it a redenomination. This should explain it.

Thank you very kindly!  I earnestly appreciate the positive feedback.  Means a lot.
We have been doing talk radio on the web for a while (almost 2 years as a hobby) but we've never done anything live despite wanting to.  Working with Lets Talk Bitcoin finally gave us a chance to do something live and despite my own nerves, (which I'm very glad weren't obvious) it was a lot of fun.  Ed and I consider ourselves performers of sorts so we're focussed on having fun while talking about things that we find interesting...like BITCOIN!  :)
The terms of our agreement with LTB and KCAA provide for a 12 week piloting period so we'll be around and doing this for 12 weeks at least.  We hope that we can provide for something informative and entertaining enough to stay for much longer and also perhaps be given an opportunity to produce even more content.  Making your hobby into a full time occupation is the dream after all.  So long as folks like yourself and others find what we have to offer to be enjoyable, then we'll be happy to keep pumping out content.
We do have good guests lined up in the short term but we like to produce with a short term timeline in front of us.  We try not to solidify a show until we're about a week or two away from airtime because if something comes up in the news, we want to be able to leave some room to react.
I like your idea to include games into the show.  I'll have to chat with Ed about that and see what we can come up with.  If you have any suggestions, I'd be very happy to hear them.  In the meantime, we'll just try to make sure we do as good a job with this show as is possible.

Year over year, where have savings expressed most value? I may be skittish about my paycheque being converted into a new financial instrument that is volatile but some savings invested may indeed be rational. Depends on priorities and appetite for risk.
All that considered, savings don't remain unspent forever. Savings are spent when a saver considers time and opportunity cost against the appreciation or depreciation of their saved assets.  This applies to cash as well as it applies to Bitcoin and when cash becomes terribly volatile, (usually by way of hyperinflation) people's time and opportunity cost judgments change.
Long story short, Bitcoin appreciates in value over time because if how it's structured. This appreciation is beneficial to savers who then may want to spend that saved wealth depending on their personal priorities.
I mean, your question didn't really have anything to do with your original question (which you so very obviously posed in good faith and not at all to troll) but you're basically asking why people would ever put wealth into something volatile. There are so many possible answers to that and they all boil down to people seeing value and judging risk. Anything with value becomes exchangeable between people with different appetites for risk and different personal priorities. Yours is an easy question to ask if you're coming from a position of hard headed, willful ignorance.

The short form "psycho" can refer to a psychopath or a psychotic.

Thanks but the situation was handled SO badly that I could just never feel confident doing business with you folks again. Ignoring a customer is probably the worst approach that can be taken in the case of a dispute and that's what was done with me.
As I said, maybe things are better now and your current customers can perhaps attest to that. You certainly have been growing so the market, in general, endorses you. For me, it'll take a lot more time to wait and watch before I'd consider giving you guys another chance and it's entirely because I was ignored when seeking resolution.
Best of luck. Please serve the market better than you served me.
@_date: 2014-02-11 15:07:17
So in an economy that is growing relative to a static money base, the monetary units will become more valuable because an increased level of economic activity is interacting with the money base. Put another way, in a growing economy, more good and services are chasing monetary units and so each monetary unit becomes more valuable.
The more businesses that accept Bitcoin, the more goods and services are choosing Bitcoin. Exchanges are only one part of a larger market and add to Bitcoin's functional utility despite volatility risks.

Bitcoin are priced by supply and demand. A miner can opt to offer for sale, a newly mined Bitcoin for double the current market price if they like, but so long as someone else is willing to sell at a lower price, it's unlikely the miner will see their offer successfully received.
Miners don't control exchanges and their ability to manipulate supply is exceptionally limited.

It is very hand wavy because I'm otherwise occupied with work. Responding to this takes notable effort in multi tasking and there's no reason to think that this is anything more than mental masturbation. I don't mean to offend when I say that this isn't an important conversation for me.
That said, bank bailouts that are unfair to consumers strike me as acting in bad faith; though to be fair, that could just be incompetence when situations like Anglo Irish in Ireland are considered.
Exemptions for banks in the bit license proposal is more likely the kind of stuff you're thinking of.

I think that if much more of this us seen, someone may try to decentralise this sort of service. Perhaps an application that reads order books on exchanges where retailers can have accounts set up and then executes orders based on market depth.
So like, retailer tells the application his login details for three exchanges and the application syncs up with the exchanges to read price whenever an order is placed on the retailer's website.
Wonder if that could work.

Hey I agree! The Bitcoin economy is growing and more likely than not in my opinion, it's just going to look silly to not accept it as payment. That said, I can see why they're all butthurt over it. Back when this was priced in double digits (perhaps even earlier) Wiksters were ridiculing Bitcoiners which just ruffled our feathers more, thus exacerbating the intense levels of butthurt both then and now.
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:23:27

Legislative battles are not remotely interesting to me and I spend a lot of time explaining why. That said, the quest for realizing social change is not a quest of singular focus. There is no "best way" to achieve freedom because freedom can mean different things to different people.
Yes, a lot of folks aren't paying attention and this is one more example of how that plays out. For me, it's an opportunity to point to a reason that folks should start, at the very least, considering the process and the state to be a threat. For others, this might be an opportunity to point to a case in which the realm of government could use an overhaul.
I'm not trying to begrudge the latter necessarily. It's just not for me.

When you get right down to it, the Bitcoin protocol is nothing more than a set of rules for communicating value from one party to another. Considering this viewpoint, prosecution of money laundering is nothing more than censorship.

If this sort of process has not yet been exposed as a farce, you haven't been paying attention. I don't mean "you" specifically, but in a more general sense and certainly I mean to refer to more the the NYDFS. Governments are increasingly contemptible toward their subjects. As technology moved us forward, beyond any sort of relevance to things like the drug war, governments cling desperately to their outdated and offensive mechanisms of control.

That doesn't wash because miners don't have control over the issued supply and their control over the supply of new Bitcoin they do have is equivalent to any other users who hold Bitcoin.
For this to potentially be an issue, (mining power being concentrated is an issue but not for this reason) the collective power of miners to issue new Bitcoin into the money supply would have to outpace current demand. Remember, right now, new Bitcoin worth approximately $2.3 Million are issued by miners every day. This would suggest that the relatively stable market has been able to maintain the current price level, despite this daily inflation of the money supply.
Miners certainly don't want to sell their mined Bitcoin at a loss, and yes, they'll try to reduce costs and take advantage of economies of scale but this conflates the issue of incentives that potentially centralize mining with some off the wall theory that miners could set the price of Bitcoin, which they can't. Miners are at the mercy of market demand just like anyone else.
Just because it cost you $700 today to mine 1 BTC doesn't mean I'll pay you 700 for it when someone else is offering to sell to me for $650. It just means you'll stop mining. This happened when graphic cards became unprofitable to mine Bitcoin with. GPU miners didn't start jacking prices because they couldn't. Nope, they just stopped mining, switched to more profitable alts or upgraded their equipment. Hell, if they could somehow have demanded more fiat per Bitcoin, they would only have succeeded in providing other miners with an incentive to spend more money on mining equipment but they couldn't because they don't control demand.

No. The guy who bought the famous pizza (2 pizzas actually) was trying to demonstrate Bitcoin's  functional utility. While savers don't "hurt" the Bitcoin economy, their savings would be worthless if Bitcoin had no functional transactional utility.
Very very early adopters faced something of a catch 22 in that if they understood the potential of Bitcoin, they would want to save it but with a very small pool of users, that potential would never be realized if transactional utility were never demonstrated.
In short, if you wanna buy an omelette without fees and friction laden payment systems, you gotta crack off a few bitcoins.

Ehm...in this case, that's generally true but our news sources editorialize just as much as any. Because the political environment is not (yet) as polarized as in the United States, the editorial slants are not as obvious, but I assure you that they're there and getting worse over time. This lack of stark polarization is the only reason we maintain some journalistic balance, but there's a real fleshy market for ideologically driven infotainment and we're starting to bite.

All any of this says to me is that the arguments for expressing whole units as anything beyond a satoshi, are by and large, rather arbitrary. Even using scientific measuring standards is rather arbitrary in that selecting specific standards, rather than being dispassionate, are driven mostly by preference and don't do anything for adding functional value to Bitcoin.  I'm not saying there shouldn't be a standard, I just don't see any dispassionate, logical means of justifying any of the measurements you've indicated.
As for what happens when we divide deeper, I don't see a problem. So one day I have one satoshi and the next day I have 10 satoshies because a layer of divisibility was added. Why would the base unit need to be referred to differently?

Well that's disappointing.  I in fact did read your message but didn't have time to type out a response.  As I said, I was hoping to tackle two birds with one stone when I returned home.  So I see your sigh and return same.  :)


Believe it or not, I'm not actually making the case for any specific numbering system.  I don't really care about this to be honest with you.  I just see these discussions as superfluous and interject for fun.  That said, I find the most affinity with using the base unit as a whole unit reference because it makes the most sense to me no matter the level of divisibility but maybe I should mention also that I think the entire planet should be one time zone.  Man do people give me guff for that!  "you mean you want my work say to start at something like 6PM?!?!!?"


No, you've been giving me reasons that YOU think it's easier to use and I've been telling you that every reason you're giving me is subjective opinion, not at all logically dispassionate.  Like you said,


That's anything but logically dispassionate.  I'm not even sure if I disagree with you if we consider how we both subjectively think other people think about monetary units but again, it's all subjective opinion.  None of it is logically dispassionate.  This is a completely decentralized system and applying standards should be logically dispassionate unless you want to set yourself (You specifically.  I don't think the market will care or be affected) up for rampant confusion.


I don't see why we need to change what Satoshi means if it always refers to the most divided unit.  If we add one layer of divisibility, a Bitcoin is made of 1 Billion Satoshi instead of 100 Million Satoshi.  I really don't see the technical problem here.  I see plenty of issues with popular perception but I really don't care at all about that.  I think this is where we're actually diverging in opinion and that's sort of a different topic of discussion.  Not incredibly different from what we're talking about but certainly different I think.


I don't think it extends forever clearly and cleanly.  You're just moving the decimal place.  Deciding when that decimal place moves may make sense to you or I but not to someone else at any specific point in time.  The thing I think is worth noticing here is that you're talking about a system of reference that entails much more arbitrary determination.  You say it yourself that maybe this happens once or twice...so why not more often or not at all?  You, I and anyone else could all have completely different reasons to justify moving a decimal place about.  I just don't see why we should use the decimal place at all.


Well, firstly, considering that the old Satoshi doesn't exactly exist anymore in this case, I would assume the new.  Also, considering that every single person with a Bitcoin balance would have experienced the same multiplication of units they owned, I would say this would be pretty common knowledge.  That said, sure I could see that this would confuse some people...just like I think referring to millibits and so on could confuse some people.  In either case, what really matters to me is whether or not the functional utility of Bitcoin has been altered somehow and whether we're using base units or millibits, certainly the functional utility of BTC wouldn't have changed.
If you deepen the level of divisibility by one level, you change the monetary base from 2.1 quadrillion units to 21 quadrillion units and the 99 Satoshi coffee now costs 990 Satoshi.  A re-denomination that affects every single holder of BTC might cause some minor confusion and oddly justified high or low prices for things but my goodness, it's a factor of 10 multiplication situation that affects everyone at the same time.  Nation states have redenominated without difficulty before; I can't imagine the process being anything but even more smooth in the free market.
So I'm disappointed because I was hoping we'd be further along in this last part of the discussion and I'm not terribly keen on devoting a lot of time to this.  Not only did I work 10 hours in -32 celsius weather, but I have other things to attend to as well.  So in a Bill O'Reilly fashion, I'll say that the last word is yours...which means that if I feel a need to shout over you as the discussion segment closes, I will.  :)

No. Andreas could take Shrem's place if foundation members wanted him to but ask yourself who needs who? Andreas has shown clearly that to promote Bitcoin, you don't need a foundation. A brain, a great podcast, a travel budget and some passion do wonders.
Right now, Andreas would be doing nothing more than lending his hard earned credibility to an organization that hasn't appeared to really do anything to earn that from him. In short, TBF needs Andreas much more than Andreas needs TBF and for us peasants, maybe we should be asking, if people like Andreas don't really need TBF, do any of us need them?

I don't think they're nearly as useful as you imply.  They employ a chief scientist which is great...and all the revenue to do that comes from interested outside parties.  Gavin (or someone else just as capable) would be able to rely on the charity of said organizations without the foundation as he already does in the here and now.
TBF is just an advocacy group and that's fine but in truth, I see the very notion of their existence to be somewhat laughable.  Yes, people want an authority to talk to but TBF is not an authority.  They are an organization that serves a support role to the Bitcoin project as a whole for which there is no centralized authority at all.  Any perception that TBF manages the protocol in any fashion or curates it is simply a false impression.  Nothing the foundation does requires their existence at all.
Adding centralization to the core of a decentralized project is the epitome of redundancy.

Nope. I'm saying, that's not the only option. More than that, a Bitcoin's value measured in dollars is just a measurement of value. A Bitcoin is worth a basic laptop or 65 hours of unskilled labor just as well as it's worth $650. 
That a Bitcoin is worth $650 doesn't mean you have to exchange it for dollars or that Bitcoin is dependant on the dollar economy. It's just a clumsy method of expressing "how much" a Bitcoin is with in a manner that is commonly understood.

Doesn't make sense to me because it's just an arbitrary point of divisibility to make Bitcoin divisibility similar to certain currencies. I don't see any logically consistent reason for one over the other side from psychological judgments that seem pretty subjective. Seems to be that referring to a Satoshi as a whole unit removes all that subjective obfuscation and is logically consistent.

It's simply too curt.  Of course there were pleasantries at the end of the message but these are so standardized that in my experience, people don't give them much of any weight.  This message should have been a more full explanation and to be such a thing, it would only have had to be one or two more sentences.
Even something so simple as "Due to legal uncertainties surrounding the nature of your business, we can not currently work with you." would have been better than what was sent.  The problem here is simply a lack of justification in the denial of a business relationship.
If, in a former life, someone came to me wanting to buy a car and I found out that they had bad credit, it wouldn't be satisfactory of me to call them to say "Hi, I can't sell you a car because I can't secure a loan for you." and then hung up.  It wouldn't be satisfactory because firstly, there would have been no effort made on my part to secure business some other way and also, there would have been an obvious lack of respect on my part.  I would have had someone crawling up my shirt sleeves asking me why I was so abrupt as the future could change and negative impressions don't often extend only to the person I'm interacting directly with...as is rather evident here.

Every argument you forward and conclude with "because it's easier" is flatly subjective. 
4 and 5 are not subjective but they also are not relevant. I could price everything I sell in Satoshi and point that it but I've no idea why I would.  So that's why I only mentioned arguments that you specifically justified with "it's easier"
Again, if a deeper division of a Bitcoin is made, I imagine it would be sensible to call the new unit a Satoshi. I've repeated this notion several times so I'm not sure why you keep asking. Again, this is why I referred to deeper divisions as a redenomination. A Bitcoin is currently 100 million Satoshi and with one more layer of divisibility, a Bitcoin would then be made up of 1 billion Satoshi.  Add 5 layers of divisibility and each Bitcoin now consists of 10 trillion Satoshi. I'm having trouble understanding what is so difficult to understand about that.  It would be like redominating the dollar by adding an extra zero. None of the base unit names change, there are now just more OF them.  This has happened many times to state currencies.
I get that using a decimal makes it easier to work with small numbers so far as you're concerned, but again, that's for you. For people who use the RMB or Vietnamese Dong, big numbers clearly aren't difficult to deal with.  Your perception may be valid for all I know but it is certainly subjective.

I can appreciate what you're saying and I'm not absolving myself of making the personal choice that carried significant risk. That's not the point here. If it were, well then yes, I'd have simply been naive. This post was about trying to exert some semblance of pressure on the operator of a service. In the end, it worked.
While this is akin to sending cash through the mail in a sense, it's in fact different. There's a blockchain I can refer to and a payment processor that added a layer of free market accountability. Oh, yes I don't think I mentioned that BitPay got involved for me too. In short, no, this was not a direct equivalency to sending cash through the mail. There was a small variety of market actors involved here, all with a vested interest in finding a solution to a problem. As well, competition revealed another market actor in the meantime.
In a disruptive marketplace, regulation isn't what fixes this stuff. Transitioning to a more free and open system will have bumps of course and it's silly to think any of this is risk free.
As for this being a forever problem, that's just absurd. As the crypto-economy grows, the need for this sort of transactional patchwork will be reduced and replaced by systems that are much more standardized in respect to function and problem solving.
I didn't claim to have some sort of a right to carry no risk here. I claimed a right to redress of my grievance and appeal to any market actor that would listen in hopes that they would be able to help me find a solution to my problem and guess what, they did! :)

Unless you have an intimate knowledge of their accounting system, I'm not sure you can make that claim. As well, they did initially tell me that they checked their account and did not see my deposit.

If Bitcoin becomes a common currency standard, then Bitcoin's value will never really stop rising in nominal terms because it's a deflationary currency in a contemporary sense. It's rate of issuance declines steadily over time, tending toward zero.
As I said in another comment, this is a kind of a chicken and egg thing. What comes first?
 Reduced volatility in value rises or common consumer market adoption? The answer is kind of both as these things will tend toward one another. For now, the volatility in real value will remain for some time, I think you're right but if we experience an unprecedented dramatic shock up in value due to a crazy consumer market rush toward Bitcoin and Crypto, it may happen faster than we might imagine.
No crystal ball to look into unfortunately, so we'll just have to wait and see. :)
@_date: 2017-01-20 03:50:58
I'm a Canadian as well with a Canadian bank account. :) I think the issue is that Quadriga is running into limits imposed by Canadian banks that limits how quickly they can move money around. Rather than be transparent about that though and provide an explanation, perhaps they simply want to maintain an air of professionalism by not mentioning these challenges to customers. I'm not sure.
I didn't want to leave Quadriga, but luckily there's also Coinsquare here in Toronto; so I'll use them. I'm happy at least that there's another exchange with good CAD liquidity that I can go to...just would rather use both...and I hope I get my money back. :)

A research economist for the Bank of Canada ponders the idea of a Bitcoin backed currency simmilar to the Gold Standard. He argues that a Bitcoin standard would likely not last very long because other monies would likely displace it that are either more flexible and would enable central banks to inflate and deflate money supplies, or that monies with "intrinsic value" would displace Bitcoin. The article disagrees with these assertions and discusses the possible flaws in the researcher's perspective, concluding that a Bitcoin standard would have immense staying power because it reforms central banks from market regulators into market competitors. In such a situation, money markets become more broad, independent of regulators and subject to market competition.
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:16:12
I don't think you do make every possible effort. I'm still not sure if you looked over my wire to confirm everything looked right. I looked it over again, and I did find a potential mistake, so that could be the whole issue. I'm also still not sure if you ever asked your polish bank anything at all.
In short, in a case of a mishap, instead of "making every effort" to investigate and satisfy, you just left me in the dark, omitted explanation at every opportunity, and treated me overall with dismissive arrogance. I'm really disappointed because up until it came time to actually try to send you any noteworthy amount of funds, I was cheerleader for QuadrigaCX. Now, I'm sure to tell everyone about my experience in hopes that I can steer people away from the possibility of suffering the same.

Just that there'd be a significant decrease in volatility. Nominal changes in prices would be much less significant than now because a Bitcoin standard would likely exist only in a scenario where Bitcoin's nominal value is much more stable than now. 
It's almost a chicken n' egg thing. Which comes first, common usage or decreased volatility? In a sense, the answer could be either or both.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:39:44
I don't. I think an activist monetary policy is limited by a Bitcoin standard as it is limited by most hard standards.
Edit: I think I misunderstood your question. That is to say, I think an activist monetary policy is made somewhat impotent by a Bitcoin standard. It's not that an activist monetary policy would benefit Bitcoin, but more that an activist monetary policy wouldn't be able to exercise a great deal of influence over a Bitcoin backed currency.
@_date: 2017-08-19 06:02:01
I agree with that. Good money drives out bad after all and part of the flaw in Mr Weber's perspective is the assumption that government controlled money is inherently better or more legitimate than free market derived money. This is why I mentioned in my commentary and analasys that a central bank would be turned from market regulator to market competitor. If it created a fiduciary instrument backed by Bitcoin, it'd basically just be Bitcoin and any fractional reserve they attempted to undertake would simply be market accountable risk exposure that anyone could emulate.
A central bank would be completely unremarkable in the marketplace given not too much time.
*ninja edit:
I would maintain that a Bitcoin standard can show market utility though in that an elastic money supply may show free market appeal in some cases. In those cases, a fiduciary instrument (IOU) would need to be created.

@_date: 2017-08-18 19:28:01
I'd tend to agree, but central banks and governments look at options that will allow them to influence the money supply of an economy, so if Bitcoin is a market reality they may attempt to coopt it to maintain some policy control over it. I don't know that that's all that realistic, but it's not something I would be surprised at.
A central bank holding Bitcoin would hold it as a guarantee against a more flexible fiduciary instrument they controlled. So while they couldn't issue more Bitcoin, they could issue more Bitcoin backed fiduciary currency which is fractional reserve banking with Bitcoin. From a central bank's perspective, this is advantageous because they can control the broad common money supply which is a part of "heating" or "cooling" an economy with economic stimulus.
I'm with you though...why not just use Bitcoin? But then you and I are policy wonks fantasizing about controlling the world through monetary policy lol. ;)

EDIT: I read your post too quickly. I thought you referred to automation, but I'm not actually sure *what* you were referring to.
Productivity growth is slowing because of monetary policy. Forgive me for repeating myself, but as I said, this is what happens when growth outpaces the capacity to pay. Productive efforts focus more and more on making up for credit repayment, and less and less on risky investment toward innovation. "Recession proof" businesses become a foundation for mediocrity as the economy attempts to rebalance.
This is caused by cheap credit, and the eventual inability of the market to pay. ~~It has nothing at all to do with automation. In fact, automation massively increases productive capacity by allowing us to do more, for less cost, and using less labour. The lie you've bought into is that automation "steals" jobs away from productive people which is an absurd fallacy. For every job "eliminated" but automation, costs go down, dollars go further, and collectively we can achieve more with less effort.~~
~~That's the foundation for more growth, not less...unless you have a limited imagination. Now, that's entirely possible, but if it is, I implore you not to saddle the rest of society with your own inability to imagine a better world ahead of you.~~
Welcome to a monetary inflation bubble. This has nothing to do with growth, and everything to do with having monetary units of account that are managed by centralized organizations. Soviet style management of monies is the primary culprit here, not some airy notion of "too much growth".
@_date: 2016-09-28 00:10:38
Erm...no. Credit has a root in purchasing power. Inflationary monetary policy and bailouts of lenders that have overextended themselves remove a layer of accountability from lending markets, and cause appreciation in assets that likely would not appreciate if all other things remained equal.
There exists a certain institutional assumption of appreciation on some assets, but if that's an incorrect assumption then it flows from unaccountable credit markets that produce an overabundance of money. That overabundance causes assets to appreciate in nominal terms.
Nominal terms are deceptive though, and cause misunderstandings like yours. In respect to what an ounce of gold is worth for instance today, it is far greater than in the past. However, an ounce of gold has always kept a relatively stable amount of purchasing power. It could buy a nice toga and sandals in Rome perhaps, and a nice suit and shoes today. Nominally however, the value of gold has fluctuated massively.
Endless growth is a hyperbolic term for progress. Economic opportunity is not limited existentially; it is only limited by our productive capacity. To assert that growth must stop at some point is to assert that we must one day just hit a limit to our imaginations. I find that absurdly defeatist.
@_date: 2016-09-27 22:00:31
Well if it slows in this type of fiscal policy environment, then it amounts to unsustainable debt burdens coming due in the aggregate. That just means that growth outpaced the capacity to pay. That has nothing to do with the growth itself, but again the tools used to chase that growth. 
The same could be said for if growth stops...though that would be far more likely to be caused by everybody just dropping dead instantaneously, and at the same time.
Edit: Typo-fu on full display

It's not an argument about what is ok or not; it's just an observation of how people and organizations should be expected to respond to incentives. Recognizing what drives this behaviour will help us create market innovations that either overcome or outcompete problems like incentivised censorship. 
So, for instance, if the desire to call one's wife a snivelling cunt comes up too often, maybe it's time to find a better relationship. As a market actor that is dependent on relationships, Coinbase presents the offer of a certain kind of relationship, and also creates a market incentive for others to offer a different (perhaps better) relationship. 
It'd be great if everyone who had some weight to throw around would be a crusader for our values, but that's not typically how it works. Relax, and do your best to be the change you want to see. It's all any of us can really do.

Coinbase, by definition, is not Bitcoin. 
You're correct that the laws do not explicitly state that any organization has to "lean into" them, but there's no rule specifically saying you can't call your wife a snivelling cunt. Guess what happens if you do. There are ways to attract negative attention without breaking the rules, and the more you have on the line, the less advantageous it is to call anyone a snivelling cunt.

Decimal place, digits.  It's the same thing.  All we're talking about is how to express fractions of a unit that can be divided 100 Million times.  That's IT.  There is no great mystery here.  Yeah, you point out that a lot of people make a simple mistake because something is tough to read which is likely why that bag has a comma after the first two digits.
There's zero fundamental difference between 12,345 and 12345.  One simply has a comma to better display the number of units being expressed.  Similarly, there's zero fundamental difference between 0.00330000 and "330,000 Satoshis" or however else you would like that value to be expressed so that people may commonly understand it.
Here, if people find value in using bitcoin, they'll naturally want to understand how much of it they're receiving or sending.  Because of this need, people will start to develop a standard of communicating units of value in bitcoin.  Trying to force the issue isn't going to do anything.  It MAY achieve some confusion as people aren't sure who might determine this standard of expression, but that's about it.
Again, biggest non-issue yet in the world of BTC.

In respect to instantly settled transactions, bank's don't actually offer what Bitcoin does.  When you swipe your interac card for instance, the banks use the interac network (a messaging network) to send each other messages to determine if funds are available, which accounts the claims for purchase will be made against and all that jazz.  The actual transactions between banks are settled days afterward so in fact, the banking system is far slower in this regard than the bitcoin network.
The Bitcoin network could easily have a debit card like infrastructure built overtop of it and have trusted bitcoin-centric financial institutions offer services for depositors.  "Deposit at digi-bank and you can use our BTC Card network to pay at retailers everywhere!  blah blah blah!"  In this case, we could still have our debit card functions intact and those financial institutions, instead of waiting days for transactions to be settled would have to wait mere minutes.
Just a matter of time.

Passthrough shares are managed by a third party, not by ASICminer. Basically, your shares are representative of shares owned by someone else who manages the passthrough.
Friedcat pays the dividend to the passthrough manager who then pays you your share of that payment. Depending on who is managing the passthrough, this can be almost instant or in some cases, lag by up to two days in my experience.

So, fees become a balancing act between the cost of auditing and what people are willing to pay. Right now, transaction fees are set but this is one of the most heavily discussed parts of the Bitcoin development effort. In the not too distant future, people should be able to access better methods of seeing the fees they pay if these discussions are any indication of where this development effort is headed.

You can't seriously think all of this holds up over the long term. The only thing keeping this laughable ship afloat right now is the dollar's world reserve currency position.  Also, while some may be calling for hyperinflation around each corner, I wouldn't be one of those. I just call it inevitable when one considers the most basic functions of the money system in monopoly use today. However, like trying to determine when a ponzi scheme is going to collapse, determining when the dollar will implode is as impossible as it is certain to determine that it simply will.

3% fees are justified by the market folks. Joseph's business is profitable and has the highest volume of CAD of any BTC exchange. You can trade BTC and CAD on Gox if liquidity isn't your concern but Virtex is unarguably larger at the moment.
I personally hope that this will change but clearly, the market can pay and currently is paying 3% at Virtex. Market innovation and weathering the rough road of regulation will sort this out in time. I'm not even saying that bitching over fees isn't justified, just that the market is pricing Joseph's service and only competitive innovation can change that pricing.
The market really should have taken care of this already but clearly government regulation is slowing everything down. Lay the blame there at the feet of government regulators, not at the feet of a businessman who is offering a service for a price to the public. joseph is acting in his rational self interest. He's not the one writing regulations that keep his competitors out of the market.

Crowdfunding service generates a wallet address where crowd funds are sent to which are then released to the startup when fundraising meets certain criteria.  If the project, for whatever reason, doesn't end up qualifying for disbursement of funds, they're returned to addresses that sent the BTC.

Minor correction. The BTC is spendable after 1 confirmation, not 6.  6 confirmations is just a recommended amount of time to wait before BTC becomes unimaginably difficult to double spend but with the size of the network being as large as it is, 1 confirmation provides an incredible amount of security as it stands.

You and your friend have $1.  Neither of you are at a disadvantage to one another.  Now, we make the dollar divisible into 100 units.  You each now have $1.00.  Nothing has changed.  You are both still in the same position relative to one another in respect to wealth.  Only the divisibility of your instrument has changed.  If we make the dollar divisible into 1,000 units, you now both have $1.000.
You are a cake maker and your customer has $1.00.  You wish to charge $0.50 for your cake.  The customer offers you $0.50 for your cake and the transaction is completed.  Your customer perhaps has $1.000 and you wish to charge $0.0500 for your cake.  Further divisibility of the units has not changed anything.
You are a stock trader and hold 1 stock worth $1.00.  The company announces a stock split in which the number of units will be doubled.  You now have 2 stocks each worth $0.50 or added together, worth $1.00.  Further divisibility of the stock has not caused any sort of inflationary shift in value.
Conversely, you are a holder of a federal reserve note.  You have $1.00 and everyone else together in the economy also has $1.00 in total.  You are on equal footing with everyone else and the total money supply is $2.00.  In fact, you are relatively very wealthy.  The federal reserve announces that it will be giving some people a grand total of $1.00 but you are not among them.  The total money in the economy is now $3.00 and the supply has been inflated.  Where you had 50% of the purchasing power in the economy, you now have just one third or about 33.33%.  The difference here between the examples of further divisibility above and simply increasing the money supply is that a preferred distributive action has taken place.  Rather than everyone being treated equally by a simple increase in the divisibility of their monetary units, a certain group of people have been given monetary units while others have been excluded resulting in a reduction of their participatory influence on the economy.
Further divisibility is not inflation.  To assert that it is reveals a fundamental misunderstanding not only of what inflation is (There is a debate as to whether inflation is a rise in prices or an expansion of a money supply.  I subscribe to the latter belief) but also, how inflation affects purchasing power.  
The reason that BTC proponents can not see beyond your assertion is because your assertion is not sensible.  To say that further divisibility is de facto inflation is akin to asserting that cutting a piece of cake in half before you eat it will somehow result in less cake being eaten.

Bitcoin is as much a currency as it s a payment system.  This is a required step in the evolution of the bitcoin economy.  While the dealer is still receiving USD at the other end of the transaction, there are bitcoin being utilized in the process.  The more bitcoin Bit Pay needs to facilitate these transactions, the more scarce they become for other transactions thus driving up the value of each bitcoin in existence.  The more active Bit Pay and similar companies are, the more liquid the bitcoin economic ecosystem becomes as well and the more utility it has (more fluidity helps this a great deal) the more relevant it becomes to more people and so again, the more valuable each individual unit becomes.
This is indeed huge in a symbolic sense and as huge as any big ticket common item retailer coming online is.  This is the first car dealership I know of that fits that bill and it's a start to something incredible...like most things related to bitcoin.  :")
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:40:05
I can't believe it. I disagree...with YOU! 'The hell is going on?
Every single buy and sell transaction in any of the many markets for bitcoin meets demands for liquidity at an agreed upon value. If you're holding bitcoin and the value is being pressured down, it probably doesn't help you yourself as an example but you're engaged in a value judgment that is 100% personal to you. So long as one continues to hold, they're making a decision that expresses their value judgment.
I for instance will never sell all my BTC for cash and just move on because I'm one of those that think this is either going to zero or to a point where traditional currencies fail to compete in their current form.
In short, every transaction on the BTC market helps the market function no matter if it defies the trend or not.

Uhh, certainly incorrect so far as I can tell.  There isn't an anarchist I know that doesn't know of and maintain a great interest in bitcoin and I know a fairly notable number of anarchists.  Conversely, I know many socialists also and very very few of them have any idea what bitcoin is or could even possibly explain it to me if given a chance to guess.
Now, if you're talking about the wannabe pop-culture anarchists that think smashing up a Starbucks is somehow an expression of anarchic social values...well then you could perhaps be correct.
As for this being functional in a socialist system, just how functional have gold standard currencies been in socialist governments the world over?  Any other standards that have not been diluted quickly or simply outright abandoned?  I'm not making a case for corporatists here; just making a simple and quick reference to the fact that a currency that constrains the state can't possibly be seen as state friendly.
Every single government on the planet right now is issuing cheap credit and can do so only because in each country, the money power is monopolized.  These governments cover a wide variety of social agendas and values.  Which one of them is better served by bitcoin?
All this said, my opinion is obviously coloured by a clear dislike for government and the like.  Take it as you will.  :)

Computers are used to audit transactions on the Bitcoin network. Bitcoin miners could more accurately be called Bitcoin auditors in a sense. These USB sticks are designed specifically to validate Bitcoin transactions and do nothing else.
For their work, miners are rewarded with Bitcoin. Some  Bitcoin comes from transaction fees and some comes from "block rewards" which are another topic of discussion.
Tldr: these audit the network and gain Bitcoin as a reward for the auditing work.

Wrong.  Inflation, if defined by the money supply growing, does manifest.  It perhaps is more well hidden but it certainly manifests.  Instead of one's purchasing power increasing as more goods and services chase the same numbers of dollars, one's purchasing power in fact remains the same because the amount of money increases as the economy grows at the same rate.
This is tantamount to theft if the money supply growth is expressed in a preferential fashion.  Who gets the extra dollars?  If they're distributed by retail banks to customers, which customers gain access to the dollars first?  Why do they get to experience the initial increase in spending power as opposed to others?

Much more 3 than 2 and 1 but 2 and 1 compounded the effect from 3.  GOX used to have north of 90% of the market for bitcoin trading and even with the growth in the exchange market, they still hold about 50% though that may drop after today.  
Anyhow, when 50% of the entire trading volume is thrown into disarray, the entire BTC economy feels it.

Gold and silver are excellent options and if you're looking to preserve wealth rather than grow it, I don't think there's any product out there with as much fungibility as precious metals.
That said, try sending me an ounce of gold in the next hour.  Also, try doing it for about $0.05 USD in fees.
Bitcoin has advantages over precious metals but they're certainly different.  I think it's entirely dependant on what you're trying to do and from the sounds of it, you're trying to escape inflation to preserve wealth.  If you're more concerned with moving your wealth into a more fungible asset that can be used much like cash, then bitcoin may be your answer.

I was focussing more on Austrian School economists as a thought.  Mises org' is supposed to be the home of anyone who would identify as an austrian as far as I see it and previous affiliation is good enough for me.  :)
That said, again, I think there's a split.  You've got more "establishment friendly" (Using this terms is a stretch) Austrians who seem to eschew bitcoin because it's too esoteric for them.  I had an opportunity to talk to Salerno about central banking and touched on bitcoin briefly and it was clear he didn't understand it but really doubted it.  That doubt and being ill-informed seem to so often go hand in hand is, one the one hand, encouraging but on the other, disappointing when coming from intelligent academics steeped in Austrian theories.

Bitcoin miners are auditors. Miners are serving a function beyond issuing the initial Bitcoin supply. All transaction fees that are paid by Bitcoin users go to miners. The lower the fee you pay, the bigger the likelihood that your transaction will be placed further down the cue behind others who pay a higher fee. The more fees that are paid, the more market incentive there is for miners to audit the network creating a competitive incentive for more miners to offer their services for lower cost to users. This is further balanced by the cost of processing transactions.

I can understand where you're noting the differences and that's not without merit. That said, this was a market in its infancy and I don't think this would have evolved into a violent marketplace by any means so the difference between SR and Escobar's operation is certainly obvious. That said, the striking similarity is the market demand vacuum created here.
What counted when Escobar was taken down was expressed market demand and a pacification of the market. Similar to the Escobar situation, government has proven to be much more violent in methodology when compared to voluntary market actors but such violence is a flash in the pan and has little effect on market demands.

The consumer, the retailer and the payment system provider are all avoiding to an agreed upon set of rules so no, I would stick to my definition that they are trading trust. I agree that is insurance.
For a current implementation of payment provider infrastructure providing a layer of trust, see Bitpay. The reason it's easier to implement is because the Bitcoin network is non discriminatory. The legacy banking system retired permission at several separate points of introduction. So basically, the Bitcoin network has much less friction to deal with.
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:13:51
I find a number of flaws in your position and also in your assumptions.  Firstly and most notably, you reference some "long period of time" over which bitcoins may increase in value.  I personally don't think it will be a long time and after a great deal of explosive and difficult to quantify growth, Bitcoin will become much more common place and predictable.  Instability talk is for people who simply don't understand what is required of bitcoin to bloody well grow.
EDIT: Oops.  Expressive contradiction corrected.
Take for example a world in which one bitcoin exists.  I have it and there is one other person on this earth.  That person offers to bake me a loaf of bread for one bitcoin.  I want the bread and no one else is offering it.  I have no use for the bitcoin, and so I give it way in exchange for the bread.  Bitcoin is worth one bread loaf.
Enter a third person who can also bake bread.  Both bread makers want bitcoin and I want bread.  I am the summation of the world's entire demand for bread.  The two bread makers are the entire summation of the world's demand for bitcoin.  Each bread maker must lower their price to half a BTC to satisfy my demand.  The value of one BTC is now two loaves of bread.  In this fictional case study (barring many other economic factors of influence for the sake of demonstration) the demand for bread would have had to have doubled along with the supply in order to keep prices static.  Also, no one is ill-served here.  I got as much bread as I demanded and both breadmakers received as much money as their products could command.  Since both breadmakers made the same amount of BTC, neither one of them has been undercut in profits by deflation as their spending power is comparatively just the same.
If you want stability, we will require something of bitcoin that would simply keep us all poor.  For every measure of output in the economy, we would need the same amount of bitcoin.  So if I produce a loaf of bread, we need to issue a single bitcoin to balance against the increase in supply and mitigate deflation.  Who do we issue that BTC to?  The breadmaker?  If so, what's to stop them from overproducing bread and simply trying to get as many bitcoin as possible?  If we issue it to banks, who is to say that they will not simply inflate the supply of money and practice fractional reserve lending as backed by the bitcoin issuer?  No...I think you've not really thought this through.
Now what if bitcoin simply remained at present day prices and adoption just grew with an increase in the supply?  After all, at today's price, ($165/BTC at the time of this writing) bitcoin miners are churning out an impressive $594,000 of BTC per day.  In total, there's enough bitcoin to support a daily volume of about $1.5 Billion USD of trade.  Around the globe, bitcoin could today offer support for $1.5 Billion on transactional volume assuming every single BTC was being used day to day.  In a given month, that would be $45 Billion of transactional volume.  It's here that we start to see the limitation of current pricing.  In 2012, the average cost of a new car in the United States was just over $30,000.  Annual sales for vehicles in 2012 amounted to over 15 Million units or about $465 Billion annually.  Monthly, that's just under $39 Billion in market activity just in car sales and just in one country.  As it stands, bitcoin's total market cap can barely facilitate just that one market alone, if it were being used exclusively for the purchase and sale of vehicles.  Remember, we're talking about a global currency that can be used in ANY market on the planet from the Silk Road to buying a vehicle from the Overland Jeep Dodge Chrysler Ram dealership in Kansas and more options coming up every day.
Comparisons like that are meant to draw a picture for you in demonstrating just how explosively bitcoin has to grow in order to be able to function as a global transactional device.  Though I have my own selfish desires, it's  frankly *not* about whether or not I want my bitcoin to be worth a million bucks; it's about how bitcoin MUST be priced in order to actually work. This isn't wishful thinking, it's a consideration of how units of exchange are traded and how their value is calculated.
So what about people who save their bitcoins and don't let go until one fateful day when they realize that they should just sell their bitcoin for government fiat?  You're bringing up the spectre of price shocks that occur when people sell a massive amount of supply into the market and drive down price.  This is a speculative assumption that can not *POSSIBLY* be justified.  It's complete conjecture and worse than assuming the detriment of price shocks, the result of spending surges, you're even assuming to know how investors think.  There is absolutely no way on earth to know how each individual investor values their bitcoin holdings.  I may have a number at which I think I should start living off of my bitcoins or maybe I have a number that allows me to pay off debt, buy a dream home, start a business, have a random gaggle of homeless cats living in luxury.  Who knows!  Every person participates in a market for their own reasons and you can't judge what they will do with their holdings.  To talk price shocks is one thing but to say that one day, there will just be a massive sell off is complete and utter conjecture.
So finally, on the deflation issue.  Firstly, the myth that hyperdeflation is what caused the great depression is just that.  A myth among many others.  Even most Keynesian economists are distancing themselves from that ridiculous assertion.  I suggest you bring yourself up to date on that one.  The breadmakers above serve to explain this.  Bitcoin is a medium of exchange, nothing more that that. If you're a bread maker and someone needs bread, why would you go bankrupt?  The issue here isn't that deflation encourages savings; it's that inflation encourages reckless spending.  If a business can't express value to consumers for their wants of greater innovation, quality goods or quality service provision, why shouldn't they go bankrupt?
Put yourself in the shoes of someone who has *only* bitcoin to spend.  Say there is nothing else that serves as a common medium of exchange.  You have 10 bitcoin and you're hungry.  A loaf of bread costs 1 bitcoin.  Now granted, if you wait a week, you can probably buy two loaves of bread for one BTC but the downside is that you might just starve. Best to probably spend the bitcoin and be secure in the knowledge that you'll also be able to buy more bread for less money next week.  But what if you are looking at something like a new laptop? Well, maybe you do indeed hold off on buying the new laptop until your savings increase in value enough before you buy it but that's a completely subjective judgment and again, one that you can't possibly hope to predict.  The mistake you make is making this reasonable sort of assumption that may apply to some people and then extrapolating that to a judgment over all of society.  You fail to consider that in an overall sense, even if delayed for some individuals, economic activity still continues along as normal and productive businesses are well served by deflation and their hyper-productivity is encouraged even further.
No matter if their savings are declining in value or increasing, people will still want food, clothing, shelter, entertainment and whatever else they want to increase the quality of their lives.  Whether they delay the purchases that help them achieve this is up to each individual.  What matters to businesses are price signals that indicate current levels of demand for their products and services and that's it.  Hyperdeflation does cause problems with price signals but deflation by itself does not.
The point of all of this is simply to say that bitcoin, to be a functional currency, should be valued in the millions at least before you see "stability" and to advocate for stability now is to advocate for the currency to be a completely unimportant financial instrument now and forever as the global economy grows.

go to blockchain.info and search the number 1 in the search bar in the top right corner of the home page.  Now, you're looking at the very first block mined.  It produced 50 coins for Satosho Nakamoto and had zero transaction fees.  No fees to collect.
Now, search...oh I dunno...155,025  A number I picked at random.  Coincidentally, this block was in late 2011 after the first bubble and following crash.  At this time, bitcoin was around $3 USD or so.  The block reward was still at 50 BTC per block mined but also notice that there are transaction fees in this block.  0.02052188 BTC to be exact and on 45 total transactions.
Fast forward.  Now search 232,021.  This is one of the most recently mined blocks.  It contains 432 transactions.  It also has paid 0.32888903 BTC in transaction fees to the miner(s) that discovered the block.  Now, this certainly hasn't made up for the 25 BTC reduction in the block reward but consider the rise (both realized and future estimated) in bitcoin value and couple this with increasing transaction fees collected as the number of transactions on the network grow.
In short, while the block reward decreases, both the value of BTC and the nominal transaction fees increase.  Miners will have plenty of motivation the future to mine even when the block reward decreases to zero.

Reverse purchase agreements amount to nothing more than shuffling debt around. In 2008, REPO obligations had spiked and the shuffling could help sweet fork all. Same thing is happening again as fed assets balloon to nearly 3 trillion dollars.
Repo. Really? Why do people like you think this isn't monetizing the debt?
As for commercial lending going to people who grow the economy, that's an arbitrary judgment first off. Central bankers distort price signals and such lending causes gross inefficiencies in the market.  That seems like another discussion though. You seem to be agreeing with  though that issuing more money through commercial lending grows the money supply by distributing new money to preferred groups.

A group of savers is in trouble. A bank is on the verge of default. Assume these two hypothetical groups are not directly linked to one another.
A central bank, could, in theory, bail out both groups providing liquid cash to the bank and the individual savers. Generally however, that doesn't happen and liquid cash goes to institutional organizations rather than individuals.
What's worse about this is that even if the bank did treat both groups fairly, any other group who did not receive cash sees a net reduction in their purchasing power when the two groups above spend their new money into the money supply so even if a central bank is trying to be fair, it still hurts people in respect to their available spending power.

So, I hope this helps you to some degree.  Consider a neat factoid.  While the network would be terribly insecure, the transactional volume of the Bitcoin network could, today, be supported by a single desktop computer with ease.  So, as long as there's one person out there who sees value in supporting the network, it will still be functional in theory.  In practice, network security is a concern but I hope that this offers you some further clarity on what the network's functional demands are.
So long as there is some reward, miners will see benefit in processing transactions.  This is what transaction fees are supposed to provide.  As the block reward decreases over the years, transactions fees are supposed to grow in size.  As the network expands, the frequency of transaction fees paid will increase and this is where the economic incentive will come from.
While there is a constantly shifting equilibrium between Bitcoin value, transaction fees and cost of mining, the network continues to function unless one of the first two metrics drop to zero.

Bitstamp has in fact overtaken GOX before and it was fairly recently.  As others here have said, no you're not overreacting. This sort of market evolution is a very big step in helping the Bitcoin network become more robust through decentralizing the Bitcoin financial  services sector.

So far as I have been told by people who have reviewed the code and understand the technical side far better than I, the limit at 21 million is a hard limit that can not b changed.  To change it would require a new protocol?  That would mean a new crypto currency.
What CAN be changed however is divisibility.  If one BTC being split into 100,000,000 units proves to be an encumberance on movement of wealth, this can be increased as needed and does not have a limit to its depth.

But what if your gold were not only as easy to move as fiat but just as fungible as well?  Remember, BTC proponents are looking at a future where bitcoin is a common mode of payment at least as common as VISA/MasterCard.
What bitcoin has that gold doesn't is that it's a primitive payment system along with being a currency standard.  Gold can't be easily divided into 151/1,000ths for one transaction and then just a second later, 29/1,000ths for another.  So bitcoin beats it in terms of divisibility.  Further, gold contracts can easily be traded electronically but eventually someone is going to have to move it to take ownership claims of it.  Bitcoin doesn't share that hurdle.
I get your point.  When people sell their gold, it's to move wealth they wish to access as that time and they move it into a fungible and depreciating asset we call dollars, yuan, pound sterling, (ironic actually) francs, vatu or whatever.  That doesn't mean that depreciating assets are more valuable though, just that they're popularized today because of governments who have taken the money power and monopolized it.  That last point aside, the point I'm trying to make to you is that bitcoin completely circumvents that step.  To hell with conversions and trading contracts for specifically divided units of gold.  No more hassle, just use bitcoin.

Thanks for the post.  I should have maybe emphasized more the static supply component.  That's one great cause for so much doubt on my side.  Difficulty becomes irrelevant if this is a fee for audit system.  Only profitability from auditing services matters in such a system.  With that incentive to mine bitcoins gone, I think that's a rather notable loss in the competitive nature of mining that encourages the growth of the auditing network which again, it would seem to me, slows the growth of the network and hurts scalability and security.
@_date: 2013-03-26 02:23:47
Doesn't "transaction fees will accumulate, incentivizing people to mine again." answer that with more than just "people will fix it" logic?  What's lacking in explaining that more money on the table to mine will serve as an incentive?  Are you saying that mining fees carry no value?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:17:49
Just stating the obvious my friend. I'm sorry you were offended. All I had time for was a drive by shooting of your comment.
As mentioned by some one else here, the value is determined by the order book and each exchange has its own order book. The people who place orders on the order book at each exchange make up the market at each exchange. So for gox, virtex, btc-e, liberty bit and others, each exchange has its own market.
Say I place a buy order on virtex for $10 and on Liberty bit, I place an identical buy order for ten dollars. On virtex, the sellers may be willing to meet me at that price and my trade will be executed. On liberty bit however, there are fewer people and so, fewer sellers. Also, because the fees are lower, sellers may feel that a slightly higher price is justified and so, I bump my order up in price to $11 and a seller meets my price.
In this scenario, the price for btc at virtex would be $10 and at Liberty bit, $11, the price if the most recently executed trade.
What's really interesting about this is watching how each exchange will track all the other exchanges. You're right that they don't directly correlate (and hopefully now you have a better understanding as to why) but when price is heading decidedly south, all the exchanges go the same direction. I hope you're better able now to understand why. :)
As for the suggestion you ended off with, I'll take it under advisement. May I suggest in turn that you go learn yo-self...huh, nope.  Still too white and Jewish to use that sort of language.

Tin foil hat? Inflation used to mean the expansion of the money supply. now it means a rise in prices. That's not a tin foil hat theory. It's just an observation of historical discussions on economics.

Lesson ahead.
In the 80s, the Brazilian government money was the Cruzeiro, until in 1986 a new currency called the Cruzado was introduced. A few years later, the Cruzado Novo, or New Cruzado was made, only to be replaced in 1990 once again by the Cruzeiro.
In yet another desperate attempt to curb inflation in '93, the government devalued the currency by taking off three zeros from the Cruzeiro and simply naming the new currency the Cruzeiro Real.  How creative!
After only a year, Brazil came up with a new monetary plan that came complete with a new currency called the Real which has continued as Brazil's currency to the present day.
What's the lesson in this?  The lesson is two fold.  The first part is about how government can't manage money for the life of 'em and that's a fun discussion but more to the point of this post, this is one example (among many others) in which people have had to cope with a very unpredictable sort of manner of constant change in how their money works.  Compared to bitcoin, this is chaotic idiocy (It is that compared to many things actually) and somehow, the people figure it out and keep on keepin' on.  In other jurisdictions like Japan, people deal with large nominal amounts of currency every day and it's not "weird" to them.  It's just how the money works and if they value the money for their own use, (assume they can pay bills, buy groceries and so on with it) they'll be able to determine simple ideas like nominal values of a monetary unit.
Bitcoin is a global currency and it's almost selfish to think that it should retain some sort of expressive value peg to the US Dollar, the GBP, Euro or some other influential currency.  There is as much value in a BTC unit to someone who is used to using Yuan and there is to some one using dollars...never mind dollars from which country. While there's a lot of desire to make bitcoin familiar for people, I think this sort of concern is ultimately born of a non-issue.  Kind of like saying that people won't use email because they have to learn how to use a computer.  While that may have been true for some people, it certainly didn't mean the world of email and internet communication stopped for their sakes.
When it comes to bitcoin, there is a very steep learning curve if you want to figure out how the currency actually functions and in that respect, there's a lot of good work being done on trying to make certain aspects of the technology more accessible to people who want to understand that angle.  However, when it comes to issues of how consumers will use bitcoin day to day, that's a different sort of a learning curve and one that is much more easily overcome by your average individual.
I don't think there's anything to worry about when it comes to people seeing something priced in 0.45562896 or some such thing.  It's just a matter of time before people start becoming familiar with it.  Frankly, things like mBTC make it far more difficult for me myself to understand what the hell anyone is saying in respect to how items or services are being valued.

Depends on the system.  Here in Canada, it's typically commercial lending instruments.  It's no limited to that but that's what's in vogue right now.  We've also issued new money to bail out banks.  So basically lending money that is priced improperly to people and institutions that can't actually afford to borrow.
In the United states, the federal reserve has been monetizing the debt so that's flat out printing new money for government and nothing more.  Also, keeping interest rates low and commercial reserve requirements low mimics the results of the Canadian system in many ways.
All kinds of spices for the pickin' but it's generally the same recipe.

Well hold on, so why do people convert gold into fiat at all then?  Your argument is starting to sound circular...or maybe it's me who's being circular but suddenly, this doesn't make any sense.
If people convert gold into fiat, it's obvious that people wish to spend the wealth they store in gold even though it's deflationary.  That's already obvious.  If bitcoin offers itself as a gold like wealth store and easy fungibility doesn't that mean that people will spend it seeing as they are already spending gold?  You can't tell me that people aren't spending gold if they're converting it into fiat.

Judging by the market, that's not enough to give litecoin a notable edge.  I could be absolutely wrong of course.  I'm not saying that litecoin can't possibly be considered just as legitimate as BTC but certainly it isn't now and the value offered seems very very lacklustre to me.
Litecoin, if it's a valuable alternative to bitcoin should be roughly 1/4th the value of bitcoin because it should have 4 times the total supply potential.  It should even be worth a little more than that if it offers real advantages like the much ballyhooed quick confirmation.
At the time of my typing this, litecoin is at just under $0.34 USD while bitcoin is over $44.00 USD or just under 130 times the value of litecoins.

That's why I want more details.  The way this boils down for me is that if people were actively threatening DPR with violence (arresting and caging him against his will) then his acts may be justified as self defence.  As it stands, I just don't know enough and would like to know more especially because the story sounds so incredibly contrived.
The problem here is that the state has created a market predicated on violent interactions.  SR managed to mitigate a lot of that violence and pacify a portion of the drug trade.  It's only when the state gets involved that violence becomes possibly necessary.  From what I've seen so far, DPR did nothing to try to secure market share and kill competition; rather, it is asserted that he is alleged to have undertaken violent action possibly because he felt an imminent threat of violence himself.  Had the states of the world universally declared for instance that they universally rejected any possibility of prosecuting DPR for running SR, I would bet a significant amount of money that he would never have felt the need to undertake the actions that he is alleged to have undertaken.

Still has a vendetta against Bitcoin as many bitcoin proponents have ruthlessly attacked him for being a greenbacker.  Still has been unable to look past his own biases and acknowledge that he's using fabricated historical information to push a message promoting a currency ideal that has never panned out in favour of the common good.  Not ONCE!
This video has all the hallmarks of why he's been ripped to shreds in the past.  He strongly implies that bitcoin is a "hunker down, AR-15 toting, survivalist's" tool of desperation and compares it to an alternative of simply pitching in to do some hard work in creating a viable state run monetary system.  Not only is this demeaning to people who would use bitcoin, but it also points to the achilles heel of many of Still's arguments.  Still is trying to defend the governing powers that gave the money power away and always do give the money power away.  Even if they don't give it away, those governing powers abuse monetary powers leading to phrases like "not worth a continental."  The continental by the way, a currency that failed harshly in the past and is defended by Still et al, vigorously today.  The founders of the USA were not idols as Still and others would paint them.  They were self serving governors who printed the Colonies into depression.  Benjamin Franklin had the contract to actually print the bloody continental notes that hyperinflated for crying out loud!
Still asks if it's not better for us to work together to gain as much self governance as possible.  He calls it the definition of freedom.  How this isn't what bitcoin is all about, I've no earthly god damned clue.
As well, this video even includes a classic Bill Still move in falsely quoting a founding father.  Benjamin Franklin is quoted (by anecdote) as having said to Hancock, "Yes, we must, indeed, all hang together, or most assuredly we shall all hang separately."  Who knows, franklin MAY have said this but but certainly, it was said first by Richard Penn.  It was attributed to him first and then 10 years later, to Franklin.  There is no contemporary account of him having said such a thing to Hancock.  THis may seem trivial to point out (and it is in and of itself) but I point it out because it needs to be made clear that every single quote used by Still et al to bolster their historical references is suspect.  They simply rely far too often on trickery and outright lying to support their theories on monetary policy and it's flippin' sick!
This typical BIll Still...which is to say it's a desperate lashing out against ideas that conflict with those that he is emotionally invested in.

Yes. The more people who want to sell their fiat money for Bitcoin, the more fiat money is required to buy Bitcoin. Similarly, as fewer people want to sell fiat for Bitcoin, the less fiat will be required to buy Bitcoin. Price us driven entirely by supply and demand. The more who want it, the higher a price the available supply will command. As fewer people want it, the price will go lower.

Ah, well I suppose that makes sense.  The point is that if gold is as easy to spend as dollars, the conversion becomes pointless and again, bitcoin proponents are looking for crypto to overshadow the monetary system.  If it becomes instantly fungible and accepted as commonplace, then depreciating mediums of exchange become an irrelevant attachment to the monetary structure.
I understand your argument but I think BTC makes it irrelevant.  Again, no dicktude intended.  I just don't think it relevant.  Keep in mind that I'm an anarcho-capitalist and quite open to defiance of the state and state monopolized money powers so this colours my arguments and opinions.

There are plenty of people who think that's what litecoin is worth.  There are plenty of people who think it's potential worth is thousands and plenty who think it worth nothing.  None of that matters.  What determines value right now is how much some one will pay to possess a litecoin right now and right now that means litecoins are $0.34 USD or so....right now.  *chuckle* 
This is not to say that litecoin can't or won't be able to compete.  Absolutely, litecoin could become a noteworthy alternative crypto currency if people see value in it as opposed to bitcoin.  Litecoin has everything it needs to function as a global transactional wealth storage device and so, it will always have that possibility.  Heck, it pretty much already has.  The very fact that people are willing to trade it and assign value to it means it's already a success as an alternative crypto currency and a wealth store.  Honestly, I think this discussion isn't *really* about whether or not litecoin can compete, it clearly already is competing.  If it wasn't, no one would be trading it.  I think this discussion is more about at what level it can compete and as it stands, bitcoin far outperforms litecoin in terms of a per unit valuation.

Myth. That may be the reason touted but bank failures  have been far more numerous with a lender of last resort system than they have been without. Compare Canada and the USA during the great depression. America had thousands of local banks fail.

Decent rebuttal but of course, mining will never stop.  If it did, the blockchain would no longer be updated and the entire network would grind to a halt killing Bitcoin.  As the block reward declines over time, transaction fees will increase along with the activity of the network and when the block reward eventually drops to zero, miners will simply be harvesting fees from new blocks in the chain.

Yes, I further stated that the language was massaged affirming my earlier statement about hiding the meaning of inflation.  Like when a politician calls a tax a fee.  Again, simple PR.  Nothing extraordinary.  I'm not sure why you think it is notable.
There is nothing wrong with increasing the money supply inherently. It is fine to do.  If you control a money, it's up to you to determine whether your customers would like a larger money supply.  What's inherently wrong is the monopolization of a money supply and then expansion of that money supply expressed in a preferential fashion.  We went over this in the 'cast.
This is why we talked about the difference between increased divisibility and increased supply through issuing more base units of a money.  You mention an increase in prices, the result of inflating the money supply.  Again, nothing wrong with that in and of itself.  If however I inflate the money supply by giving new monetary units to specific groups of people, those groups benefit not only from an increase in purchasing power directly proportionate to a purchasing power decrease in the hands of every one else but also from getting new money first.  Getting new money first allows the preferred groups to spend money before the effects of inflation are felt by others, further compounding the loss of competitive purchasing power among those who did not benefit from the new monetary units issued.

So if I understand you correctly, the blockchain currently stores an 8 decimal place value to denote the number of satoshies stored at an address.  
If we adopt another decimal place, because that value is already stored on the blockchain as an 8 decimal value, it would not match the new 9 decimal place values written into the blockchain and so, old addresses would control less value.
Interesting.  Not a problem that is at all unsolvable but certainly disastrous if not considered.

Assuming that you're looking at the order book, you're seeing available bids and offers. 
If you have an offer of one share for 1.69000000 and another offer of 5 shares for 1.69000001, then you'll see both offers separately.  If for example 10 people are all selling 1 share each for 1.69000000 you will see it on the order books as 10 shares total for that price.

I did mention briefly that bitcoin may not end up being the only crypto currency out there.  Indeed, this is already the case as Litecoin has made a very good move as being a viable bitcoin alternative already.
As for government regulation...yes because file sharing and illicit drug sales have been made to be so very very uncommon.  *chuckle*  I don't mean to be condescending, it's just too irresistible a jab in this sort of discussion.  If bitcoin continues to prove to be a viable wealth store more difficult to confiscate and account for than gold, I don't think government regulation will be a concern to the long term viability of bitcoin.  Of course, regulation can slow consumer adoption down sure but stop it?

So I remember reading about how Iran was telling people at one point that the Rial was valued at such and such a value to the USD.  I think the USD was illegal to hold at the time too.  Whatever the case, people in the street were trading three times as many Rial for US Dollars as the Iranian central bank was saying they were worth.  In short, Iranians didn't care what the central bank said USD were worth, they were letting the market tell them what it was really worth with price signals.
Bitcoin is decentralized and if people want to exchange BTC for less or more than any "pegged" value, they will.  The entire point of Bitcoin is to allow people to escape capital controls that hinder the movement and management of wealth.  Artificially pegging bitcoin to some sort of dollar value is one of those attempted hinderances.

You're asserting an ability of a centralized interpretation of the reasons that people like or dislike a brand. This is doomed to fail.
Gold and silver are popular as stores of value specifically for their fundamental attributes. Their psychological attractiveness is inspired by many different reasons but in a wider market view, none of those reasons really matter because those psychological inspirations would mean absolutely nothing without the fundamental attributes.
For instance, if water became easily convertible into gold, no one would care for it anymore no matter how much history it has as a supporting psychological factor.
This makes so very little sense. You're advocating adding friction to a frictionless payment system; a frictionless payment system that has demonstrated an amazing ability to be adaptable and functional but because change frightens some people, (this is always the case with innovation) you want to add friction to satisfy them?

It's a point worth making and one I meant to discuss but we "flowed" elsewhere.  Gold does indeed have commercial applications beyond simple wealth storage.  Silver also has value in commercial applications; many more applications in fact than gold.
That said, lead also has many commercial uses available to it.  That something is commercially useful doesn't make it a wealth store and in some senses, even dirt could be considered "valuable" in some way if we consider commercial applications.  Some commercial aggregate companies make very good money digging rocks out of the ground and grinding them up into gravel but certainly, rocks are basically worthless.

You're off by a factor of 10 there.  The number of units mined per month is 108,000 if mined every 10 minutes.  25 BTC every ten minutes.  So 25 X 6 X 24 X 30=108,000.
it's actually even more than this given practical considerations.  Not sure what the average time is at right now but 3 months ago, the average time for a mined block reward had fallen to 5 minutes which would put the total at a whopping 216,000 Bitcoin mined per month.

Quick question to answer your question.  Of all the businesses that have grown up around bitcoin, (bitpay, bitinstant, Mt GOX, Bitpay, bitcoinstore, coinlab and many more than I could possibly list) how many do you suppose can be brought into existence by copying the bitcoin code, tweaking it and slapping a new badge on the hood?

There's that other topic of discussion.  :)
Bitcoin is not controlled by a central authority.  Bitcoin is a communications protocol that is decentralized.  Think of a dollar as a communications protocol in a way.  When I hand some one a dollar, we have essentially exchanged a message that says I have one less unit of value and the person I gave the dollar to has one more unit of value.  Bitcoin operates in this sense as well.
So with that provided for context, bitcoin also has rules written into it that make it a deflationary currency that is issued over time.  It gives out "block rewards" as a way to sort of kickstart the currency.  When bitcoin started, there were only 50 bitcoins issued and then about 10 minutes later, another 50.  This was Satoshi (The creator of the protocol) mining bitcoins at the start and providing 50 bitcoin per block.  A block is a record of transactions.  Like a page in a ledger.  Each block is a new page with bitcoin transaction records written on it.
Currently, bitcoin block rewards are worth 25 Bitcoin each.  Every four years or so, the reward is cut in half until eventually it will reach zero many years from now.  This is a design that ensures the currency is issued over a notable period of time rather than all at once.  Further, as the network grows, more transactions should take place and pay more fees to the network which are collected by miners.
So each time you send a bitcoin transaction, you have the option of including a small fee to pay to miners.  Some transactions will likely not be processed for a very long time if fees are not included.  When a miner "discovers" a new block, (writes a new page into the ledger) they receive the sum total of the fees attached to the transactions they have audited and validated along with the block reward.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:34:54
Why does this not bode well for BTC as a currency?  BTC is as much a currency as it is a payment system upon which payment infrastructure needs to be built.  Think of the interac system.  Interac is basically just a messaging system where ABC bank sends a message to ACME Bank indicating whether a transaction can or can not be securitised resulting in that transaction being declined or approved.  An interac swipe is one bank saying to another "Hey, will you be able to settle this transaction within a few days" and getting a response along the lines of "Yes.  This customer has the appropriate level of cash in their account for this transaction.  We'll send it along later this week."
Things like bitpay are a big step toward having an Interac network for bitcoin which is what we need for it to work at POS terminals everywhere.  Today, every time you swipe your interac card, merchants are basically accepting zero confirmation cash transactions because they know that the people who participate in the interac system will settle their transactions with cash reserves.  We need the same infrastructure to be built for bitcoin and it's certainly indeed being built.  This bodes very very well for BTC.

I'm not sure many people would equate power bills or their mortgage payments to lunch money but even so, isn't lunch important?  You're making value judgments for others which is something that central banks attempt to do as well.  This is central planning of price signals and other economic motivators which simply does not work.
The point here isn't even about value judgments which you are running to in order to justify your opinion.  The point is about whether or not central banks create advantages for some over others and whether or not this is a good thing.  I say that fundamentally, this is a bad thing.  I have pointed out that this creates inequality from a central point of authority and I think that's bad but you're embraced it which is fine but what is not fine is that you then used your personal value judgments to justify that.
I make no such judgments and instead seek only legitimate, market driven, accountable process to understand how markets are working and reacting to market actors.  You will openly criticize people for wanting money unless those people run large concerns like a mammoth corporation and assume that the mammoth corporation is simply a better place for money because it's more productive which makes no bloody sense because they're asking for a bail out which means they are in fact a money sink!

That's actually exactly how press releases work.  I've done pressers for more than one organization and they have ranged from the professionally formatted including a "below 30" and the "DUDES! THIS THING IS GONNA HAPPEN" sorts.  A press release is nothing more than an informational shout out to the press about a new development out in the world that has taken or will take place.
You're correct that nothing is secret about bitcoin but that doesn't mean there aren't a myriad of people who don't know about it.  I did a 7 minute interview for our local news talk radio station and jammed as much info as I could into that time and the host still cut some excess and added to another segment.  All of that not for a lack of clarity but rather because he thought it was a fascinating topic and he wanted to get as much info out as possible.
No one is the bitcoin spokesperson and yet, anyone who wants to be, CAN be one of many.  If you think you're well spoken and are willing to address a multitude of people in speaking about bitcoin, go n' do it!  Anyone should be encouraged to because the press is nothing more than an extension of the same sort of discussion that takes place on any internet forum every day.  The press is just another place where things get talked about and if you think that sphere is some sort of hallowed ground not to be touched unless you're a pro, you['re missing out big time!

Price discovery in the BTC universe is, as yet, not nearly universal.  What some people may not realize is that price discovery even for very liquid traditional currencies like the USD and Euro are also not universal even though they appear to be.  If you trade currencies on two different brokers that use different liquidity pools for their price quotes, this becomes apparent if you know to look for it.
Similarly, since each BTC exchange is essentially a separate liquidity pool, price discovery is not universal.  Further, because the overall market is small, each exchange's prices (supply and demand within that specific liquidity pool) are more easily affected.  The larger the BTC market, the more narrow the disparity between exchanges (liquidity pools) will become.
For now, price discovery is likely best done at the largest exchanges.  Today, Bitstamp seems to be the best exchange for USD price discovery.  The volume at that exchange is the largest rival to the other largest competitor (MT GOX) and GOX currently has outside factors that are influencing BTC price at that exchange specifically.
So basically, any price ticker that plugs into a Bitstamp API is what I would recommend.

The first transaction has very poor network propagation.  You may want to ask your customer what Bitcoin client they're using.
If they're using bitcoin -qt, they should leave it running.  I believe the program rebroadcasts unconfirmed transactions every 30 minutes though I could be wrong about that.  bitcoin -qt used to have a -rescan command that could be entered in the console but that function is no longer available.  I'm not sure about other clients. It might help if, in the case that the customer uses a different client, that they keep it running until the transaction is confirmed.
Alternatively, they could import their private keys into a blockchain.info wallet (or other well connected client) which will basically result in the transaction being rebroadcast should it still show as unconfirmed.
It's a tricky issue that the dev's haven't really addressed so far as I know.  They should address it however as traffic on the network grows though with bitcoin -qt auto-rebroadcasting unconfirmed txs, maybe they think they have.

Well, I don't think hammering the point that Silver has more base utility than gold would have been *overtly* relevant to the discussion though I understand and appreciate what you're pointing out.  Gold is simply much more rare than silver and *both* trade in a long maintained speculative bubble far above their "intrinsic" value.
Really, Gold and Silver are both very useful stores of value because of their physical properties and are indeed affected by supply and demand.
So yeah, this discussion certainly does directly relate to what we were talking about on the show but I don't think I would consider it any sort of missed opportunity.  There was a lot to talk about and I don't think our case for supporting bitcoin is at all made or broken by this specific facet of the discussion.  :)

You've identified the problem that other crypto currencies face and will face in the future.  Litecoin brings nothing to the table aside from more divisibility but bitcoin offers unlimited theoretical divisibility so even that's nothing amazing.

The problem here isn't actually inflation or deflation as both of these things, in a decentralized economy, are simply signals.  They are neither just or unjust; they just are.  The problem rests not in whether a currency is inflationary or deflationary (It should be noted that Bitcoin, when fully issued is in fact static) but rather in whether or not it is manipulated.
When centrally planned economies are built on planned inflation, an insidious quality of this is that those who get new money first experience the benefits of spending that money before it is distributed widely.  Not only does this cause inflation as the market reacts to more money, but it compounds the loss of competitive purchasing power experienced by the common folks.  Unless money is distributed to all market actors simultaneously in a centrally planned economy, it is unfair by design.
In a centrally planned economy that is deflationary, the constriction of a money supply can also be targeted to the advantage of some and the detriment of others.  It can be taken by calling in debts from common depositors for example as opposed to larger institutional depositors who then retain their spending power while the spending power of others is lost.
I don't think this seems to be about inflation or deflation.  I think you're just not hearing a valuable discussion on why decentralized is better than centralized.

To me, this is why bitcoin is destined to become the base layer in a payment system that has multiple layers that will include a modern incarnation of banks if not traditional banking institutions already in existence.
Think of what happens now.  You, a customer have a bank account at ABC bank.  The store you buy a shiney trinket from has a merchant account with Acme Bank.  You swipe your debit card and ABC bank sends Acme Bank a message that they have the funds to cover the transaction and within a few business days, they'll settle the transaction but for now, there's a legal promise that the money you paid for your trinket will land on Acme Bank's books soon.
Such a system makes the banks a second layer in the payment system.  You deposit your bitcoin with a bank and the bank manages transactions with other banks via mutual agreements similar to what makes the interac network possible today.  What's great about this is that you can still use bitcoin independent of these organizations if you wish and that you can send bitcoin across the world for no fees without one of these theoritical banks means that there will always be a default competitive edge that keeps fees minimal for banks that do provide a second layer of payment infrastructure.

Yes, everything you list (which I have read) is basically of zero overall value.  It's not incredibly innovative and adds very little functional advantage over bitcoin.  I'm not saying litecoin is "bad" just that it doesn't add notable value to a user *over* bitcoin.  That's all.
If you think about it, even traditional payment systems that we have today take a long time to "confirm" in many cases.  Heck, depositing even cash at an ATM can still see a five business day wait in some cases.  I'd say 15 minutes or less for a confirmation beats that. In other words, bitcoin's clearing system I don't think is the most notable problem that users face today but that's another discussion.  This is just to say that in that respect, I don't think litecoin really adds much for users that won't really know much about how the network operates.
Divisibility is completely valuless.  There really is NO functional advantage that this adds at all.  I don't see the discussion there.

Also, the REPO agreements absolutely are monetizing the debt.  Firstly, not all debt is sold into REPO and secondly, there is one reason I can dismiss your notions out of hand and not take you seriously.  That reason is twofold.  First, REPO agreements are no longer made public by the fed and worse still, system repos are hidden as well.  Know what system repos are?  Yeah, that's straight up, complete, unadulterated and unabashed monetizing of the debt.  Secondly and more commonly understood is that M3 hasn't been reported by the fed for a while now.  How can you honestly talk to me in defence of debt monetization by insisting debt isn't being monetized when you don't even have access to the data that will show gross money supply increases?

While it is wonderful to see a new business (especially one that manages such nicely decorated homes) begin to take on Bitcoin, your post worries me slightly in that it's possible you're not properly mentally prepared for market fluctuations.


Bitcoin is still a very very small market that is prone to wild swings in nominal terms.  You may be well served by observing previous price corrections to see what has happened afterward.  What happened in April of this year and in 2011 is widely known but less known is the price correction in late 2010 when Bitcoin went from $0.07 to $0.50 before correcting back down to $0.25 or so after falling to as low as $0.14.
Bitcoin has increased hugely in value and then dramatically corrected three times.  Each time it's corrected, the price it falls to and then stabilizes at later has been higher than each previous event.  So in 2010 the stabilization was $0.25 after a $0.50 high, in 2011 stabilization was $2 or so after a $32 high and in April of this year, price stabilized at about $105 after dropping to $50 from a $266 high.
So what do all these price points tell us?  Nothing really concrete.  I'm giving you my insight but just keep in mind how much you're paying for it.  :)  I believe these patterns are worth taking note of however because of Bitcoin's fundamental structure.  The more that bitcoin is adopted by consumers and businesses alike, the more value Bitcoin gains as a medium of exchange.  So long as the bitcoin economy grows, (and it is growing) there is more and more of a fundamentally sound justification for explaining that increased demand will drive Bitcoin's exchange value upward.  With this in mind, it makes sense in consideration of fundamental economic rules, that after each dramatic correction, Bitcoin's base to which it stabilizes in each case ($0.25 in 2010, about $2.00 in 2011 and about $105 earlier this year) has been higher than each preceding event.
In the end, no one can tell you for sure where the Bitcoin to dollar exchange rate will be tomorrow but in lieu of any technological catastrophe, it's very reasonable to make a case for Bitcoin fundamentally over the long term.  As the Bitcoin network grows and more users become engaged, the more and more value each Bitcoin will present.  While there will be speculative spikes panic driven dips and quiet periods in the Bitcoin market, it is my carefully considered opinion (It took me about a year off and on to think Bitcoin through) that over the long term, Bitcoin, unless competitively displaced by some other wild innovation, will express a value that dwarfs today's rates.  While Bitcoin could skyrocket to $1,500 tomorrow (not completely inconceivable though rather unlikely) or plummet to $100, you should be aware that the path ahead may present some emotionally tough to deal with moments if you're not expecting them.
Congratulations again.  I believe that you're an early adopter of a wealth communication technology that few people can actually appreciate the grace of.  I hope it serves you well.

Sorry, not trying to be a dick. :) hahaha.  Maybe some expansion on the answer with some bitcoin related context.
You're focussing on fiat.  People sell gold to obtain fungible value because gold is not as fungible as fiat.  Gold is also not as movable as fiat, more difficult to store...basically, gold is fine as a currency (you're pointing out here that people can transfer value out of gold for the purpose of obtaining purchasing power and mobility) but it's not convenient.
Bitcoin trades tangible composition for efficient portability that rivals fiat both in respect to expense and time.
In short, bitcoin does both what gold and fiat do.

Actually, you're right.  Some of the innovations that are coming about now are payment systems that would facilitate the movement of bitcoin.  As a communications protocol, bitcoin is simply a monetary system.  Like interac had be built overtop of the currency system, so too does an instant payments system on top of bitcoin.

Sorry, typo.  Investing as opposed to spending.  IE, the money you get in a bi-weekly paycheque used for bills and such is not money typically used for investing.
As for the other stuff, I can only say I wish I had the time but the deflationary argument has been rehashed endlessly on this subreddit.  A deflationary currency is a good thing, not a bad thing and bitcoin is very different from gold.

The fact that you're citing Bernanke, Keynes and Krugman is enough to make me hurl.  Milty was just ill considered in his assertions I think.  That and Chicago school economists lack some principle I'm afraid.
I mentioned that hyperdeflation does indeed lead to some problems, the sort that you describe in your post but not because people are encouraged to sit on their wealth, but rather because people are unable to properly identify price signals.  When you get right down to it, basic needs spending is as much a judgment call as is buying a new luxury car.  You COULD just try to grow all your vegetables, raise cattle and so on to provide for yourself and spend as little as possible but this is a negative value judgment for most and explains why specialization in a market is valuable.
Specialization allows us to pay no mind to how to build a house and instead concentrate on our skills in baking bread so that we can offer baked bread to others who would rather concentrate on their home building skills so they can build homes for those who would require that homes be built.  Specialization not only creates more efficient delivery of services such as bread making, but also requires that market participants develop a need for all of their own wants to be satisfied by others who have specialized and further, need their own demands satisfied by still more people who have further specialized.  In this way, we can see that an efficient economy (read: Free of regulatory nonsense) will always encourage not only better delivery of goods and services, but an increase in demand for specialization as well.
So, it is this in part that causes me to ponder whether inflation or deflation in fact have any effect on consumer behaviour *at all* and further, I wonder still why very wealthy people spend a lot of money on increasing their wealth security when certainly, by the measure of most paupers, they are already secure in any imaginable circumstance.  Ah...and here is why economic activity continues regardless.  No matter how well off you are, you can always be better and even if you're completely contended, chances are that you either think others should enjoy the joys of our wealth or that you're simply bored with your lot in life and spur further activity due to your own want to be engaged in something.  This is conjecture however, so let's stick to more basic assumptions of the human condition.  If I have a pile of wealth and no reason to think I'll lack financial security some day, I'll satisfy all of my basic needs and then either find value in satisfying wants or not.  Let's say that I've got all the bread I could ever need and so now, am wondering if I want a computer.  Now perhaps every one is in my position.  Perhaps we all "want" computers but don't need them and the longer we hold off on buying a computer, the less we will have to pay for satisfying our want.  That's fine.  There's nothing wrong with that.  This is simply an individual judgment of value.  The holder of wealth will need to consider the cost of the thing they want and weigh it against not having that thing right now.
Whatever the speculation on how wants are satisfied, all that matters are price signals.  ALL.  That's it. Let me further explain.
I take some small effort to point out once again that I had said hyperdeflation clouds price signals just and hyperinflation does.  "Hyper" would likely indicate that something abnormal is happening and there are probably reasons for it.  The functional structure of bitcoin explains that today.  While technology helps to mitigate the harm done by unclear pricing signals, certainly it is a hinderance to the market.  That said, this is anything but an indictment of deflation.
Put yourself in the shoes of a television manufacturer.  You're telling me that deflation will discourage the purchasing of televisions and hat could possibly be true.  I don't think it is but let's not discount the assertion entirely.  How is the television manufacturer, on a basic level (no talk here of the suppliers, shipping costs and so on) to know whether or not savers of money may finally be persuaded to buy his television sets so he doesn't go bankrupt and can continue manufacturing his product?  You said that businesses go bust right?
Well, if the manufacturer simply produced televisions with no mind to demand, certainly yes, he would go bust.  However, if the television producer found that for a television that cost him $100 to manufacture, he could only command a price of $150 before sales dropped off, this would indicate clearly that he would have to keep his cost under $150 to be able to turn a profit.  If televisions could command only a price of $75 and he could not bring his cost down, then yes he would go bust but then this would lead to a decrease in the supply of televisions and their prices would go up again.  Should the business owner stay in business if they can not produce a product for the price that the market is willing to pay?  I submit that yes, they should go bust but should there be an adequate demand, they should be allowed to stay in business.  
This is why inflation and deflation on their own don't really have anything to do with whether or not the market will function long term.  Government intervention into currencies will cause problems by obscuring or even eliminating these pricing signals that tell producers, consumers and others how to judge the market and how to access their needs and wants but in the end, the market will always win no matter what we do.
I find the assertion that deflation causes a decrease in economic activity to be a fundamental dismissal of the human condition and further, the ignore what price signals mean to market participants.  The real evil here is simply mismanagement of money that is facilitated by un-free markets.
Also, I'm Ethan by the by.  :)

Not here to defend this broker (I wouldn't sign up with these guys if I were still into this sort of trading) but several larger brokers have fines levied against them with some minor frequency. FXCM for instance is one of the world's largest retail fx brokers and they've landed in regulatory simmering water a few times in multiple jurisdictions. 
Again, not trying to defend this broker. I know almost nothing about them but regulatory actions taken against brokers if this sort do not automatically denote a company that is not too be trusted or branded with general incompetence. I think there are other reasons to be careful when considering smaller brokers like a lack of history in the trading marketplace.

Actually. Wallstreet first approaches government and says "Hey, point guns at our competitors so they can't compete with us" and then, Wall Streeters write a bunch of other legislation (spuriously called regulation) and bring it again to government and say "hey, pass these laws to establish the rules the govern our industry...and keep suppressing our competition too!"
The so called "self regulation" that you're referring to is in fact corporatism and nothing more.

@_date: 2013-04-21 14:47:28
Ethan here.
Money is a highly political tool today because governments have monopolized the money power.  It's impossible to divorce individual money sovereignty issues from bitcoin.  If you use bitcoin, you're using a device that is directly competing with a government's money.  If too many people use bitcoin, it becomes untenable to print a bundle of money for say a new tank or a new hospital.
This doesn't mean that a government can not start to use bitcoin but even if it does, it still means that, for instance, a government can not simply go to a central bank and bail a bank out.  It means that taxpayers will see directly the costs of fiscal mismanagement.
Satoshi specifically referenced bank bailouts and also libertarian ideology in his writings and again, as I point out in the 'cast, specifically approached Joe Matonis for input.  I don't make any claims to know specifically what Satoshi was thinking but he's left plenty of implications for you and I.
For instance.  From an email archive in one of the most recent entries.

This is where I think the very term "bitcoin" is ill-conceived but hey, if we're going to have a problem, better that it's in the window dressing than in the kitchen equipment.
I like to emphasize that 1 bitcoin is actually one whole lot of the digital currency and that the lot is divisible into 100,000,000 units.  So basically, "You need to think of it as buying 5,000,000 units of bitcoin." or some such thing.  Explain further that bitcoin, if it is successful, WILL some day reach a valuation that is in the millions per whole lot and that their individual units will be worth many times what dollars are today in regards to what they'll be able to purchase.
Yes, a whole lot may be cost prohibitive for some today but on the whole, they're still very cheap compared to their potential purchasing utility.

This is a maturing market.  This type of disaster leads to wider spread use of other bitcoin exchanges.  Right now, GOX still has around 50% market share.  That has to be reduced by natural market competition and it is being reduced by exactly that.

In the last 24 hours, they've done roughly $6,000 in fiat of business.  If BTC increases in price and volume holds, this figure can only increase.  Just revenue alone brings the company into this neighbourhood.  It's not entirely unreasonable.  Don't let the Shark Tank on TV make you think that there aren't any investors out there that don't think longer term.
Truth is, the valuation MIGHT be a little high.  I'm not sure it is but hey, that's for the market to decide and as of this posting, their IPO on havelock has generated over $140,000 in what, a few hours?  The market has some confidence in this it would seem
