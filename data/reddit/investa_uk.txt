this market has a very short memory and huge upward momentum when it gets moving.
In a couple of weeks BTC will be back above 15k and everyone will be wishing they had bought more at 10k! ;)

why dont you go tell some equities traders to stop buying Apple and Google stock until it halves in price. Crazy...
Bitcoin has its negatives, but there is nothing else like it and therefore it will always have a value to some people. As it evolves it will become more useful and valuable, not less...
Buying dips makes a lot of sense for an educated investor who intends to HODL

bitfinex has a huge buy wall at 9500. will be hard to break below that level. 
its bouncing hard every time dips below 10k

weird that exchanges cant verify faster. i mean it must take less than 1 minute to verify an account (quick scan of ID doc to check its genuine and matches account name and that's it)
Its also the kind of job than can be easily outsourced to 3rd party workers - as the risk of fraud &amp; mistakes is fairly low on simple checking of ID - especially as software such as netverify can auto check images as a first filter.
An exchange should be able to activate an account for at least 1st level of verification very quickly, then if the user trades or deposits over a certain threshold amount, then an extra verification check should be done (but the volume of users would obviously be much lower)
I know major exchanges are swamped right now, but staffing up teams for verification checks should be quicker and easier than it seems to be..

If Bitfinex really had a hand in tether 'printing' unbacked currency, then:-
A. Tether is the same as any other ICO which creates new tokens and then uses them to exchange for other tokens. Being backed by USD or not, make no real difference to the coins bought with tether - except that the price of tether may not remain pegged at $1 if people lose confidence in it. 
B. Bitfinex could have much more easily created user accounts with $1bn balances and supported the BTC price that way, so why would they need tether for this purpose? 
C. lack of auditing doesnt automatically prove fraud - it could be that the auditors dont understand crypto - im sure it is very hard to educate a set of presumably skeptical/ narrow minded accountants how crypto actually works...
Overall, the FUD doesnt make sense and is designed to hurt the BTC price for the benefit of the trolls. So, lets move on....

What a bull run, time to take profits and hope it doesnt keep climbing? ... or just sit tight and HODL on for the ride!

Bitcoin has had a huge rise, so it may not be the best time to buy. 
But who knows how far this bull market will go..!
If you are going to buy big, wait for a market dip of at least 10 % then buy in when its low..
Good luck!
