Huh, I havn't seen a cheque in years, they always struck me as being a very insecure way to transfer money...

Bitcoin provides pseudonymity, it doesn't provide anonymity, it provides complete transparency.
Anonymity can be added if you can mix your bitcoin with others, but it's not part of the bitcoin protocol.
Confusing the two is problematic.

This is (one of the reasons) why i'm in favour of some sort of digital cash a'la opentransactions on top of bitcoin as a value store. Bitcoin is the wrong level pf abstraction for a currency.

You should look into [umatrix]( It's does what NoScript does, and more and gives you much more granular control with a better UI.

Hmm, does it even need to support more tranactions? Surely another system with fast transactions and less decentralisation guarantees could just use bitcoin as a value store? I think I remember reading something about this years ago...
Bitcoin seems like the wrong tool for doing lots of small transactions, why not abstract over it?

I havn't followed bitcoin in years, but that quote makes them sound like pretty powerful community members.

Pseudo-anonymous has a very different meaning from Pseudonymous.
pseudo anonymous means "approximatly noone involved can or does know your name"
pseudonymous means "people know you by a name that's not your own"
Think pseudorandom and  Pseudonym.

If you GPG encrypt your email then Google can't mine them for data, so they've no incentive to give you free webmail.

And hopefully, once people the centralised infrastructure like bitpay is in
place on top of bitcoin, other projects using technology similar to open
transactions will gain widespread use.
Bitcoin is great as a value store,
but the delayed transactions and lack of true digital cash-esque anonymity
are still weak points.
