It is far more likely that you have already given your personal information to Google, Facebook, Linkedin, Apple, or similar orgs and that they will either 1. hand that info over to a third party without your explicit consent or 2. hand that info over to the government if you have some kind of "association" with a suspicious person.
Releasing your personal info isn't in the public interest, but it is for commercial interests.

Hypotheticals aren't really going to help you understand how the world actually works, I'm sorry to say. They have their time and place, but in this case, it's just far more instructive to look at what has actually happened.
Take things into perspective a little bit. Collateral Murder, for instance, was a video that Reuters knew existed, and it was requested repeatedly through legitimate channels using the FOIA. It was never obtained by this method, though I believe it was supposed to have been approved for release (that's just from memory, could be wrong on that last point). The video garners a lot of attention because of the journalists killed, but outspoken people in the Army have repeatedly stated, that what was shown in the video was the **norm**. I am certain there were some repercussions for people involved in that incident which were probably unwarranted or negative for those people. Put it in perspective though.
Of course full disclosure isn't always a good thing. WL is selective. Cryptome is the one that isn't really :)

Yes, which is why I doubt WL would "get your personal info and expose it to the world in the name of freedom."
