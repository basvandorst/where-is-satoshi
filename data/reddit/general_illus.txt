Shapeshift should consider using personality assessments when hiring. They can sometimes be helpful revealing the sociopaths applying for a job.

If you don't want your content "stolen", I suggest you stop putting it on a huge global network of computers where it can be easily parsed and copied.

Agreed. Although, I am happy Eric is making this stance and setting this precedent. Comparing New York to DPRK just weakens his position.

I tend to stay away from loans in BTC only. As an investor, they just don't make sense. If Bitcoin drops in price, you get paid back less, if price spikes, the chance of default increases. It is a lose/lose. On BTCJam I stick with loans tied to the local fiat currency. On another note, on bitbond.com, I have had a significantly higher default rate than BTCJam, so I would be weary of borrowers on that platform.

Not sure the developers are "profiting". They do have to eat. Do you expect them to develop this software for free? The great thing about Crypto's and tokens of value like bitcoin is it allows everybody to be a VC. If you think it is wrong, then don't fund the development by purchasing SJCX.

I stopped listening when the video showed a clip from Monty Python's, The Holy Grail. Tough to take anything serious after that.

Not to mention the the page will load significantly faster without all that crap. Sign me up for $50/year.

Because there are very little applications that use the bitcoin blockchain where the end user as NO IDEA they just did a bitcoin transaction. Be patient. This is just starting.

Great. Time to curtail needless consumption. The health of our planet is at stake. People will still spend, they will just be more thoughtful about it. This is a good thing.

Well, in terms of child abuse and terrorism, we can always rely on good old fashioned police work. You know, like we have for the last hundred years. Breaking encryption and monitoring everyone's communication seems a little short sighted and will likely cause more harm to society in long run.

TIL since 1970 is "like, forever"....LOL.
 
Not to mention these laws don't require breaking or making encryption illegal.

Haha. Lol on trying to trick Bitcoin community.

Not buying this argument. I am early investor in bitcoin, I have bought more crap and consumed more goods and services in the last 4 years as the result my new found riches than I would ever be able to have afforded with my 9 to 5 job. Definitely not 'depressing' any economic activity over here.

Agreed. This goes for all places that accept bitcoin for donations. I would be more inclined to donate if all I had to do is send BTC to a public address. Making me fill out a form...forget it. I might as well stick with digging my credit card out of my wallet and going thru all that hassle of typing in name, address, etc. Bitcoin should be frictionless, scrap the form and I will donate.

Not according to wikipedia....
"There is, however, no federal statute that a private business, a person, or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in cents or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy."

Yes. They are getting into mining pretty heavily. Spondoolies ASIC manufacturer is a shareholder. Also have wallet and bitcoin only eCommerce site, as well they are investors in several bitcoin startups, such as GoCoin &amp; CoinOutlet. At first, I thought scam, but management keeps investing their own money in the company. I guess we will see.

First publicly traded Bitcoin Miner. Be curious if any financial guru's can help estimate the value of such a company. BTCS currently has a market cap of 36M. Overvalued or Undervalued?

I hear you. I remember when Amazon.com started offering other items than just books. I was like this is going to be huge, shopping from the comfort of home and all. Everyone told me I was an idiot...."nobody is going to buy pants online, you need to go to a store to try them on first". I bought the stock and have not looked back.
@_date: 2015-11-05 05:24:27
Most likely by the individuals who are trying to pull off this scam.

I hope nobody is buying this. Fake website. It is  not  I have also been following this company closely, they have no plans to release a SP40. Their next product is the SP50 and it is specifically geared for industrial scale mining.

You do realize high frequency trading is completely unethical and exists only because the settlement layers are centralized and the owners of those settlement layers make money by allowing HF traders to skim money from the normal  and necessary trading of your 401k. Blockchain technology is meant to stop all this. Which hopefully it will.

I hear what you are saying, but creating too high of a negative return on non productive assets is likely to result in more malinvestment and larger bubbles in real estate and equities.
