the forum has been hacked a number of times, and despite the substantial income and donations to the board, theymos appears to have karpeles style dunning-kruger going on, and refuses to accept that these problems have been solved already
they're also happy to host advertising for scams.
just a reminder, the government particularly likes to regulate industries that refuse to regulate themselves.

You wipe your backside with paper that is more valuable than the net worth of a great many people in the world; this technology has the power to change that.
And you're talking about *marketing* bitcoin as convenience to help (relatively) fortunate, entitled people, buy things they won't ever need--cheaper?  How is this not vile and entirely missing the point?
And you even praise the ideas in your opening paragraph with weasel speak, as if his words didn't go whooshing over your head.

I'm sure the people advising him have bias towards status-quo, so won't look past things like scalability issues, not realizing how nimble the technology is (by comparison).

the industrial uses of gold have nothing significant to do with the "intrinsic value" of gold, which is that it's been a store of value throughout human history
but paper-based information transfer (also an age-old way of doing things) fell pretty quick once we figured out digital

The wealth gap/politics (how is the debt ceiling even a thing with this money system?), consumption of resources, and state of the environment (waste logisitics) all make me question consumerism/inflationary economics.  I don't see how these things can grow exponentially, forever, and yet our economy requires it to function.
@_date: 2014-03-13 16:18:09
The market value of monopoly money.  Intrinsic value is a terrible phrase, please stop using it.
Intrinsic means belonging to something by its nature.  Value is one of the most abstract things the mind can ponder, and it is *always* relative.
Does the phrase natural worth make sense?  What's gold naturally worth?

it's hilarious because comments like this show exactly how you (or your friend) don't have an understanding of the blockchain technology, and why many of us would be here even if it had nothing to do with money (though that's its most natural first thing to displace).

This is a trick question-- absolute power leads to corruption, absolutely.  With bitcoin, the power is distributed; unless you are a banker or extremely wealthy, you stand to gain (financially and freedom-wise) from bitcoin's success.
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:11:32
an address is a single public key/private key
a wallet can be one or many addresses. usually when you say wallet, it implies the ownership of it's private keys.
if you send coins to someone's bitcoin address, the coins will end up in their wallet.

Weird.  My experience with newegg customer service has been that they just handle it, with very little hassle from my standpoint--although I am extremely annoyed by and avoid all forms of phone support, which I hope becomes fully phased out in the next few years (text is far less ambiguous, and they clearly use a computer to solve the issue *anyway*).
Before tigerdirect started accepting BTC, all I remembered them for was the scammy mail-order catalogs from the 90's.  It seems like they've somewhat cleaned up their act and are trying to be a newegg competitor, no complaints on my recent purchase.

I think this represents a fundamental misunderstanding of the bitcoin technology.  The nature of the technology is distributed and incentive based.  How would financial institutions possibly implement a distributed ledger system that couldn't easily be undermined or would offer benefits over their current system?
@_date: 2014-01-31 00:49:38
Call me crazy, but--if I were a major money institution--I'd be all over taking advantage of bitcoin to become the leanest, most profitable, company (in history?)--as a last hurrah on the way to a more free world.
Which is weird, because concern does seem like what he's holding back, not excitement.

they weren't expecting the level of publicity from floating the idea, and made it a priority to capitalize on once that happened

@_date: 2014-03-19 06:11:42
i hoarded my coins for a long time, but recently started allowing myself to spend them
averaging probably a couple purchases a week, and i gotta say, it reminds me how freaking awesome and simple btc really is to use
@_date: 2014-02-17 11:25:34
Because you have "accounts".
You don't need bitcoin, but you probably didn't need to move out of your parent's as a young adult, either.
Really, I think of it the other way around:  bitcoin lets me transfer and control wealth digitally, so I no longer need giant, historically (presently? necessarily?) nefarious entities hanging over my life.
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:37:54
well for now, i'd say spend some throwaway money on bitcoin, secure it somewhere safe, and come back to it in a year
i say that because year over year the coins should have appreciated a bit
then you'd see how easy it is to start spending them, even though the same thing will probably happen over the next year.
second, we live in a world with finite resources, and the modern economy comes from a generation that hadn't even considered it.  the modern euphasim for planned obsolence, "product lifecycle", is a scary thing.  we need to consume and literally waste in ever increasing ways and amounts (or the world economy falls apart), creating a race against discovering a source of limitless energy and resource starvation. 
not cool.   edit: my point here, is that maybe using a money that doesn't need inflation is kind of ok.  i think decay is natural.
