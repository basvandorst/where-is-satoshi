Why is this good or bad? Not trying to judge your answer, just don't understand. If possible... explain like I'm five.
@_date: 2019-11-24 14:17:25
So you tried it?
@_date: 2019-11-24 14:19:24
So you don't actually know this first hand. Thanks.

I mean it has to be right? But people are getting their money out of this one? It doesn't make any sense. It's being heavily advertised as if it is legit. 
I'm sure it is a ponzi but why is it being so highly advertised and "out there"? Why hasn't it been shut down already?

I appreciate your response!

I appreciate your concern... 
However, I can afford to pay off a loan and plan to HODL to end game. The earlier I buy in, the more I make in the end. I'm not a short-term gains type of investor here... I just want a firm hold on the rocket when we launch.
But no house... I was thinking a smaaallll loan.

I wonder if they already did do this with the big dip we saw earlier. Scared out a lot of investors right before the Bakkt big announcement. But they could do it again!

Best way to avoid fees when buying/selling? Coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:57:17
I appreciate this, thank you.
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:50:48
This is true!

After buying a small amount of Bitcoin on Coinbase, what should be my next step? Do I send it to another wallet? Do I put it into cold storage? I am still learning here, baby steps.
@_date: 2019-08-20 12:56:55
Ah yes. Thank you for this. Sarcasm...
@_date: 2019-08-21 21:01:03
Is Coinbase Pro the best way to avoid fees when buying/selling?
@_date: 2019-08-20 03:46:08
Thank you for your response!
@_date: 2019-08-04 04:49:19
I plan to HODL.
So you transfer first to Coinbase Pro, (how do I get this?) then to a "hardware wallet"... is this the same as cold storage?
Sorry, still learning...
@_date: 2019-08-20 04:49:56
Never thought of that! I only need one! Talk about leverage... THANKS!!!!
See, sarcasm is funny!
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:02:34
I like your suggestion! But what if I suspect moon in next 6 months and would like to pack my bags before I go?
@_date: 2019-08-20 18:43:56
Well then thank you for that!!

It's a dump from whales who are taking last steps to accumulate bitcoin before Bakkt launch. Other buyers will see this as a blessing as well, and further add to bitcoin's cause above 10k. Eminent breakout soon. After small down comes major pump!? Finger's crossed.
@_date: 2019-09-19 03:19:46
It's happened more than twice in the last 3 years so...
You've been saying it, and it's been happening.
