I've tried e-mailing him, he doesn't bother to respond. You're saying I should use ilya ? I feel like it won't make a difference...

I've waited a full week - he said if I could prove the transaction was cleared by my bank (it was) then the coins would be released. I don't see why I should have to wait longer when the money is already deducted from my account

So what you're saying is you don't mind losing $75 out of your bank account? Great, I'll give you my other btc address and you can send ME $75 bucks, since it means nothing to you. I have a shitty job and $75 is a lot to me
@_date: 2015-01-25 19:16:36
Yeah, essentially. It's what he asked me to do
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:23:40
Yeah, for sure. I'm really the one at fault... it sucks... I'm still trying to get people to help, but I don't want them going through hours and hours of time just trying to crack a password for a fee... someone told me I should take pictures of my passwords if I have to. I don't like that idea only because metadata is stored in pictures, but I should have done something other than save it on my external b/c apparently I didn't save the right password, lol
So mad at myself right now

Thanks for hijacking my thread, asshole.

He's helped a bunch of other people out by retrieving their passwords, it just so happens that this password is a long one with symbols so it would take a while to run combinations or brute force it (which I now regret, I should have made it something like "idiot69")

I eat like every other normal person, wtf kind of question is that? 
Regardless, yeah right now it is the only BTC I have, although I have other wallets. I reposted this on DMNSnoobs offering the whole wallet as a reward
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:28:07
Yeah, I mean the BTC isn't exactly "lost" yet, I just can't do anything with it. So really it is causing a bigger pain in my brain than it should be
@_date: 2015-01-25 11:19:33
He does. I think he was just being nice, I offered coins to him anyway. Maybe because I didn't have much in the wallet to begin with, compared to people that work with BTC every day
@_date: 2015-01-24 22:46:05
I think I tried "password". Didn't work
@_date: 2015-02-05 03:20:37
It's resolved since a long time ago, but thanks... lol
password ended up being something shorter than I thought
