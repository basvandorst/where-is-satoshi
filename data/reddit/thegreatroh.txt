A ban would lead to loss of adoption among normies and have it's purpose be only for weed and hookers which is not what we want.

Have each pool payout be 1uBTC and send them the receipt.  This way they lose money processing it.
Or 
Practice more discreet ways.

Pretty much trolls, SRS ideologues, jealous people that did not get on early, people who lost big while trying to make money.

I'm not an early adopter of bitcoin but there is a reason why bitcoin has its ideological slant. 
When bitcoin was first released it was supported by libertarians and An-caps. It allowed for anonymity and made it really easy for the anti-tax types to get along. It was primarily held together by those types. The fact that the currency is deflationary attracted those who subscribe to Austrian economists. Bitcoin was supposed to be the middle finger to taxation and democracy.
Now you have people who want to change the fundamentals of Bitcoin, making it easier to track, and tax. When you go against the primary reasons why bitcoin was founded, you are talking away the hopes of those who bought early and kept bitcoin alive till now.
Next you cite how unscientific the adherence to Austrian Economics is and how we want a deflationary currency is going to ruin bitcoin. There is nothing unscientific about bitcoin and it's adherence. Bitcoin is a proof of concept for lassiez-faire markets, and heterorthodox  economics.
Tl;dr Bitcoin is inherently with lassiez faire economics and changing that is changing the point of bitcoin. If we wanted the security and wanted to use inflationary currency we would be @_date: 2015-05-13 16:58:28
