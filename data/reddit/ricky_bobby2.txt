I must have told dozens of people to buy Bitcoin in the past few years. I don't think any of them did.

Yeah, Bitcoin is still a great store of value. At the moment it's more like digital gold than like a payment system.
I think Ethereum's growth is due to new people buying it and others hedging their bets.

I got my father into Bitcoin and he's up about 300% which feels great. 
Especially because my sister's a bitch that talked to me condescendingly about Bitcoin and told me to shut up about it within 2 minutes of talking about it.
She's changed her tune now.

I wish I hadn't listened to the internet trolls 5 years ago ;)

Take their money and buy Bitcoin with it. They'll thank you later.

Which channel was this?

These programs just encrypt your harddrives and want you to pay ransom. That's all they do.

Today was the first time in over 3 years I didn't do my meal payment with Bitcoin. 4 dollar fee for a 12 dollar meal... I don't think so.

You'll just have to wait till 0.0001 bitcoin is an acceptable fee again, either because of the price rising or the network not being clogged anymore. Eventually you will get them out.
Or maybe you can use the wallet.dat file in the new multibit client?

How does that work? Can't miners just resist changes that Vitalik wants to implement?

Try to split your Bitcoins over many accounts. That way you don't have to worry about a large amount on your desktop pc for when you swipe the private key with Electrum for example.

Do you know if it's possible to just take the old wallet.dat file and use it in the new multibit client?

Bill Burr agrees:
