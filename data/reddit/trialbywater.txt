Of course they will, it would be stupid not to. I guess OP was just flexing his muscles then.

Have you signed up at other services? Wouldn't this prove a breach of their security? I haven't received this email, but I signed up at many bitcoin services but not any of these... Coinbase, btx.

He signed a waiver where he explicitly agrees to defrauded by PayPal? Nah
If OP documents his history of communication with PP and shows malice coming from PP regardless of the reason,  especially if he underlines the clean status of his account and use of his PP account, then he stands a chance of making a case.

is one case enough to warrant losing licensing for cc use?

Just got in touch with the CEO of Bitcoin, and I gave him the go ahead to use the biggest bitcoins available.

Yes, he called me not 30 minutes ago telling me the CEO of Reddit gave him the green light to give me the go ahead and start using the biggest meme Reddit's got.

I agree, Joe Schmoe will most likely struggle with most concepts down to the bitcoin wallet, but waiting until we have a perfect solution is an idealist's way of doing things.
Right now Bitcoin is entering mainstream through a variety of vectors, and we can't really stop that, just improve upon it.

and those goods would reach your place of residence without knowing your address? Sooner or later you're going to have to give up your address, that is unless you're buying virtual goods.

Wait for it to pick up and then you gained her money. Your bitcoin amount remains the same, and all she'll care about is being able to buy  a new purse for those earnings.

That's good on you for taking *Note* of your top *3* phones.

Yeah that would make most of us millionares. I'm betting 10K or so.

Why? We are at a point were we certainly have enough coins in circulation and enough miners to handle transactions + new coins, so they next logical step is public adoption, which is what's been happening this year.

I'm new to bitcoin, but shouldn't you first create a physical wallet on your computer and keep it backup on usb with a password instead of online backups. 
Of course you trade risks of having your coins lost, versus stolen, which imo gives you more control over your money.
