Fool me twice, can't get fooled again. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 07:09:25
Well sure, but the sending address is the one where the witness signature is segrigated, so the fee is based off that I believe. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:06:30
The alts I picked won't ever go down, they are solid.
For example, I put a second mortgage on my parents house and we put it in Bitconnect.  We are gonna moon so hard.  I usually pull profits every weekend!

What is your txn id?
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:25:54
They don't use Segwit yet.

Each day a new more users use a non segwit account.  
Some of the biggest, ie gdax / coinbase still using nonsegwit.  
My wallet of choice, coinomi hasn't activated segwit, but should this month.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:39:38
Which is why I'm saying coinbases claims are false.  There were leaks.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:43:24
For now.  
Consider it forced savings.  Scaling is a problem, but solutions will come. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:51:30

Pffff, no way they'll probably ban your account out of spite. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:30:27
They both should be same source information, but the BTC = BCH is something certain parties implement to confuse new users to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:07:56

You'll need to make a new segwit wallet.  And transfer everything to your new wallet. 
Just slowly migrate to the new wallet, no need to just transfer there for fun.  Just slowly move them when time allows. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:00:09
Nah.  Back in the day people were about profit...
Well, until mt gox.

I'm really bad at guessing though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 07:42:46
That chart is in Satoshi / byte.  Since Bitcoin price is going up, even if Satoshi/byte goes down or stays similar, it'll still cost more usd, right?
We need more wallets to implement segwit fast! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 23:41:53
Very odd.  Maybe try a support ticket? 
Try simple bank, it's an app on your phone.  Free.  Opens up in 2 minutes. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 16:45:34
It not garbage.  This is good for crypto.  This is a fully regulated stable coin.  Shows it to be FDIC where applicable.  (I need to read into the limitations of this)
With how scary Tether is with their bullshit / nonexistant regulations, this will at least put at peace that 1:1 ratio of GeminiDollar and a Bank Account exists.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:28:40
Coinomi does too.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:40
Also if you hold over 1 year, you pay less tax.

@_date: 2017-12-17 04:01:16
Real estate agents have nothing to do with it.    It's up to the seller if he wants to accept it.  And a title company to facilitate it. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:44:38
Only an idiot would do that.

Not according to new regulations released this week. 
@_date: 2018-09-13 19:22:38
Both of these are fishy.  The first one uses a quote from Chief Executive Officer James Gorman from earlier in the year.
The second one said "a person" with the quote being presumed current.  But it was the same quote.
Is this more fake news / copypasta / news in the making? 
And like the Stearns news earlier, it says "Morgan Stanley declined to comment".... Which means.... "Hey, this is all bullshit"

@_date: 2017-12-18 14:54:34
Actually yes, it'll have a positive affect.  Most relatives are sick of hearing about pyramid/reverse funnel scheme's like stocks, bonds, mutual funds, etc., So they are your "target" customer. 
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:09:36
ya.  mah bad.
I guess I would think it would work easier for those of us with small hard drives.   I know the limitations, however for a lightning node, this would be fine, right?
edit: maybe im thinking of spruned - it lets you download needed blocks / transactions on the fly, when needed.  so you can run a node off a 500 MB HDD.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:51:29
The natural growth rate of Bitcoin is higher than the rate of return of cloud mining, so you lose money compared to just holding.

Lol this is the one complaint I have about coinomi.  They aren't the most..... Professional.  They are sarcastic, jerks, they blow things out of proportion with snarky news releases, etc.  It's like a bunch of Reddit users made a company.  It makes a lot of people weary.
Just go read random medium articles from them, read their Reddit feed, and their Twitter feed.  It's awful.  They need a PR or social media person to "humanize" their responses.
Or a chick like Paige from that Scorpion show on CBS that has Walter O'Brian. 
Edit: that SSL issue is annoying.  A user found a bug, they said "nuh uh", pretending their wasn't a bug, then fixed it a bit later.  Doesn't it make more sense to say "this is being patched asap? Thank you user. 
It let's the community know you are listening.  Coinomi, nobody is perfect, communicate. Fuck.

If you aren't worried about fees, use coinbase normally. Instant credit up to $25000. 
Gemini is awful.  They are stepping away from retail customers and chasing institutions anyway.
Geminis instant buy is low.  A mere 500.

Wires don't ask you "why"
Only to who, and for how much.  
You can put why, if you want, but you don't have to put anything on the reference line.  
And wires are very fast, even international ones.  
I've sent thousands of wires at this point. 
The $45 fee isn't unheard of for international tho. (Sender and receiver)

Banker here.  I see clients routinely send money in the millions.  Fees are flat for wires.  Usually 10-20 bucks.  
For our larger clients, we waive the fee.  I've personally wired upwards of 20M for clients.  10 dollar fee.  
Sure, fees right now for Bitcoin are great, but we can't let them get to Dec 17 levels again.  Then banks win. 
There is no "percent" as some people claim.  This is not visa or MasterCard.  And most wires will be completed within 30 minutes.  It gets faster everyday.

Liquid is not innovative
Looking at what has been said about Liquid - it's not an innovative technology. It can be boiled down to:
Funds are deposited in a multisig address controlled by multiple exchanges
Transfers between the exchanges happen when multiple exchanges sign off on the transaction in a mechanism similar to green addresses
Transfers require no confirmations because the network won't sign a double-spend against itself

Hm, interesting.  I admit, paying more than a dollar in fees for a cheeseburger at McDonald's doesn't make sense with regular bitcoin, but lightning could help.  Just the initial connection would be pricey.  Man, a glimpse into the future would be nice.  I guess I'll have to hodl.  
The nice thing about this all, if gloom and doom hit a chain, couldn't they just update a code to fix then problem?  Or would groups just let it burn to the ground?

Coinbase charges a fee.  It's for beginners, also they'll lock in the price.
You can also use gdax (same login, same company) for the pro site.  They don't charge fees for makers, only takers.  (Use limit to buy)

So, if you have a point a to point b lightning chain, the funds don't actually get sent via the block chain until it is closed?
What if side A goes offline on accident? What if side B goes offline on accident?  Say .... DDOS.  Who do the funds go to?  Do they take side A's word or side B's word?  Do funds stay in limbo? Or return to sender?
Is there a way to send to person B, then DDOS them, cause them to go offline, then get your funds back?  Because the blockchain won't know the transaction occured until the lightning network is closed properly, correct?
I'm I an idiot and not understanding how it works correctly?

The problem with these new crypto cards, is it's just a fiat prepaid card.  
The only TRUE card was the coinbase shift card, which was cancelled. 
Their card exchanged crypto on the fly . 
These new cards, make you exchange the crypto for fiat beforehand, then just buy stuff.  Visa and MasterCard are requiring this - which is annoying.

That is not what has been posted and confirmed before.
Japanese law mandates only the value of the property at the time of loss be returned.
So if you had 100 bitcoin worth 10000 dollars, you'll get 1.1 bitcoin or so.  
If this changed... where is the source?
What I don't get is this article says they will get their claim in bitcoin - however the Mt Gox treasurer has been selling lots of bitcoin ?  What was the sell off for?  I thought it was to get fiat to return it. Very confused.

I guess, but I just wanted to point out that Wires can't be reversed.  They can try to send a reversal message, but it can be ignored.  That's why so many scams, especially with the real estate business, try to get you to send wires.  I've know people lose 300k plus when somebody hacked an email and send fake wire instructions.  Lives ruined. Etc.

You need to check.  This is especially scary if you use your wallet for cold storage, if somebody steals it - they can potentially brute Force though it if there is a vunerability (which they are found and patched all the time)
You'll be good if you keep up on patches - but it's definitely not a set it and forget it solution.

@_date: 2019-04-30 15:52:13
I'm guessing this isn't a crypto card, but just a prepaid fiat card where you have to manually convert crypto to fiat first...
let me check
YUP.   You have to manually sell your crypto to fiat then you just use your prepaid account.
So, this is NOT a crypto debit card.
Also:  a quick way to tell if a product is a scam is this verbage:
"Tap n Go (TAP) has partnered with Transact Payments Limited (TPL)"
Anytime a client says they are a "partner" - they are just full of shit.  If you ask TPL if they partner with Tap n Go, they will say no.

There is no official spokesperson, but there are official sources. 
The direct sources of the information.  For example, if a company releases a new version of Bitcoin core, we link their tweet or medium post, or whatever, not a blog talking about the tweet.

So here is what will happen.
1) it will be centralized.  Users won't control their keys.  This is FINE as a stepping stone into crypto.  We don't want users losing keys, getting scammed, etc.  We want users buying Bitcoin, and spending it for coffee.  
2) fees will be zero.  because it is centralized, like coinbase, transactions in and out of users bitcoin wallets will be free for both parties
3) in a year or two down the road, the app will possibly allow transfers out of wallets or allow more broad Bitcoin transactions.  
The main point is with this integration is to save on credit card fees and to get users use to how crypto payments work.

@_date: 2018-11-10 01:54:21
1) don't buy with debit card. the fees are stupid.
Anyway you can just use your bank account?  Gemini will let you buy bitcoin up to 500 with a bank account....  But you just can't transfer out for a few days as your transaction settles.  
Coinbase Pro takes a few days for your transaction to settle, then you can buy.  
Technically, coinbase pro is slightly faster class you can be a maker and pay no fees.  
Debit fees are like 2-3 and sometimes up to 5%. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:15:31

I recon it'll be similar to how QuickBooks does it?

My hub is just another node I run on my PC, connected to other nodes. 
So, I was trying to use my phone, to connect to my "hub" only, that then routes to the rest of the network, to force payments to route through my hub, just to test.
It's odd that my two nodes would automatically close.

The channel closed and said (uncooperative).  Does this happen if I restart my PC?   (It was off for like 8 hours).  
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:58:02
It is only for QuickBooks online.  When customers pay an invoice, they get 3 options, eCheck, credit card, of if you enable the lab, Bitcoin.
By accepting bitcoin, you can either convert to cash, or keep the Bitcoin.  It uses bitpay as it's backend.
As a business, keeping bitcoin is sometimes hard.... You know, payroll and all.  And tax implications are confusing.
So, I just buy Bitcoin personally on my own.   Keep it out of my business books.  
@_date: 2018-04-06 19:13:47

I guess i mean, why would nodes automatically close?  
Does time lock have certain things to do with it?  Like if two channels are not talking to each other for certain amount of time will they automatically close? Or can one channel keep it open indefinitely? I guess I don't really understand the rules because I have one node on the eclair on my mobile and one node on my computer running eclair as well.  Randomly my note said uncooperative and it closed between my nose and my phone but I didn't close it myself.  Why would it automatically close? What are the reasons it might choose to do that.

It's a hypothetical with coinjoin that concerns people, I didn't mention Wasabi. 
A quick Google will find discussions.

So it's a case of it being "technically true"

Ok, thanks for the financial advice.  Got a second mortgage and went all in.  Mortgage is due soon, hopefully this works.

Ya.... Transactions don't fail like that....
If it failed, you'd still have your bitcoin.  If it succeeded, they have it 
Post your txn.

You are only suppose to use paper wallets for one transaction...... to hold long term, in cold storage. 
I'm confused what your point is.   Are you saying people are using it more than once?  Turning their condom inside out and still hoping they won't get fatty mcfat fat pregnant? 
Thats human stupidity, not a weakness of the paper wallet - when used appropriately.  Perhaps your point is, other things are more flexible?

Why is it good practice?  From what I read, if an exchange blacklists coins, this could blacklist yours too.

Thank god people are starting to see it.  A++ post.

This is good for Bitcoin!

Yes.  Like, they hate Vegita memes.  So they sold and crashed the market.
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:24:36
Exactly, do the opposite.  Everybody seems to be buying.  So I'm selling.  Buy high sell low.

They charge at&amp;t 1% on the fiat conversion as well.

If you get the seed phrase, they have your info. 
An encrypted paper wallet is safer.

I just tried to pay my bill.  QR code didn't work.  Very frustrating.
