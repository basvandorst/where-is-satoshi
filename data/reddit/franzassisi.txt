There are numerous scientists who doubt that human made CO2 has a significant impact on temperature - it didn't drive temperature in the past. A very prestigious meteorologist in Berlin had a lecture on how the ice age ended 1850 and that rising temperature are fitting in the cycle of colder and warmer periods on earth. Plus sun activities and the influence on the forming of clouds seems to be a much more promising theory than the highly politicized theory of human made carbon and sinful living being responsible.

Is he talking about men made CO2 being the main factor in driving up temperature or flat out claims they haven't risen since 1850?

But that's the fantasy PR it is sold with. 
How can you own the means of production as a community, if the individual doesn't own property? 
If you want to redistribute other people's wealth you need a centralized elite that has the monopoly of power to take wealth away first. 
They own the means of production. 
Plus the whole economy is centrally planned - not by the will of the community, but the will of communist commissars. In capitalism however every individual is expressing their will by individual consumption and thus in the sum of individuals represent what the majority wants.

@_date: 2018-08-08 09:56:22
It's not that unexpected, if you look at the 6 month chart. We are in a downtrend with lower highs and lower lows. It remains to be seen if this low is going to be lower. But it could still be higher than the last low - that would be a sign of a trend reversal. Plus compare the behavior to other bitcoin bubbles bursting the years before. It can be a slow recovery - but it has been a recovery to higher highs in the past.

Yes. Most veteran traders think it's going to take 3-4 years for new highs.

I can follow the thought, that there has to be another drop so the bots and institutions want to buy. Because why haven't they bought on the levels we were stuck for so long - there was not much volume on that level as well.

On the other hand Berlin is dominated by leftist "protest" groups that just chased off a Google campus - because "rent would go up" - so Google left...

Yeah... why decentralization? Internet has done nothing for us... Or books outside of the hands of well meaning monks... Or abolishing any monopoly. Useless... People can't handle freedom. Let's centralize it. We just have to give power to a well meaning government body and have us ripp off mildly.

To be safe I'd even say, higher highs and higher lows, after it has broken the trend line (plus higher volume as confirmation). 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:50:27
Or wait for the trend to turn and confirm. You don't get the absolute bottom, but you are much safer than guessing the bottom.

Lower highs and lower lows. Lower high is next. 
@_date: 2018-06-18 19:02:25
Of course everything can happen. But looking at 6 month chart the trend hasn't changed. So you have to assume continuation.

I really doubt you read his book - in fact I suspect you are trolling with the amount of ignorance and misinterpretation of what you call "Neo-liberalism". 
Slaves are demand and supply? Voluntary interaction, like in a capitalist society? "Free to choose"? To forcefully make someone work for you and take his proceeds or throw him in a cage sounds very much like what socialist governments do. The socialist Ussr had the the whole eastern countries as slaves, in East Germany government didn't even let you choose what to read, what music to listen to, what to study, what job to do ... And you attribute taking human rights away without any accountability to Liberalism rather than governmental concentration of power? 
You spew the same unfounded bs like any run of the mill champagne socialists.

Is there a possibility to run the node anonymously out of the box - so to keep the home ip address protected. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 05:53:18
I thought so too some years ago, as Germans love cash - but Germany is becoming a totalitarian Shithole so fast lately and 90% of Germans fall for socialist ideas and state television propaganda - if it's wrapped nicely (environment, green, solidarity) we will lose cash with some mild protest.

bisq decentralized exchange.
@_date: 2018-07-30 08:59:44
Probably the easiest way, would be to open an account on coinbase and add an bank account to it. So you can cash it out conviently. 
Nobody knows where bitcoin goes - if you need the money now, cash it out.

It helps always to zoom out to 1 year or at least half a year. Then check whether the trend is broken. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:25:02
It's still in a downtrend, lower highs, lower lows. Assume continuation until proven otherwise. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 10:23:20
You could also use bisq. It's also peer-to-peer with escrow. And you have the private key to your wallet. 
But it's always good to have options. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:45:33
Use bisq - it's the next best thing to local bitcoin and a lot more convenient. It's the best and most private peer to peer exchange there is.
