I am not sure if multibit is an HD wallet or not.  But with HD wallets like electrum you only need to back up your coins one time.  It uses a "seed" usually in form of a 12 word list that is used to create all your private keys.  
Creating new addresses is good for privacy mostly.  It also has some security benefits.  One thing is when you reuse addresses, you are broadcasting signed transactions to the network.  If there was ever an attack on the ECDSA encryption used to sign transactions, then your address could be vulnerable.  Its probably safe anyways, but its slightly more safe to use new addresses for each transaction.

Funny how he also says "I have been explaining exactly from day 1 why it wouldn't work, why it was a dumb idea, and why it was going to ultimately fail."
He doesn't say "why it will not work", or "why it is going to fail" in future tense.  He uses past tense, like he thinks it has already failed.
He is basically claiming victory because the price went down a little bit.  I see this a lot from trolls.  The price crashes some, then they somehow think bitcoin has "failed", and do a victory dance.  Pretty sad and pathetic.  I wonder which troll on sub is rawdogletard.

"Bitcoiners called me an idiot, said I didn't understand the technology, I didn't know what I was talking about"
"I looked at Bitcoin, I literally spent like I don't know...15 minutes reading the architecture, and I have been attacking it ever since"
This guy does a great job of discrediting himself.
