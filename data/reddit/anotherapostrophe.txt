Sweepstakes require a gaming license
@_date: 2016-08-06 07:09:15
If you say so, son
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:12:40
Lol @ you thinking people only use 1 address
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:22:36
Probably older than you kiddo.
I've lived and traveled in foreign countries more years than most people have been in the working world.  
You live in fantasy land. There is no karma, the bad guys win a lot more than the good guys.

New accounts are disqualified
@_date: 2016-08-26 00:05:05
google drive for backup copies
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:09:25
Lol, not true at all

IT'S TOTALLY THE YEAR OF LINUX!
@_date: 2014-09-20 23:38:29
There can only be 21 million coins ever. I've heard more than a few horror stories of thousands of btc lost at a time
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:49:20
Apparently you can't read.
It was a suggestion to a problem that will eventually crop up
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:06:53
Unless you do lots of it
@_date: 2014-09-09 05:43:38
Critical mass, we have hit it
@_date: 2014-09-20 20:18:08
Then it is doomed to fail eventually
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:11:53
Lol,that bubble lasted a whole 7 hours
@_date: 2014-09-08 08:13:14
Bitcoin museum. Bitcoin library with books to read about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:20:09
Its about the standardized knowledge, not the cert
@_date: 2014-09-08 07:25:41
Peaceful. The government can build far larger mining systems than any private citizen. They will run it into the ground once they realize that.
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:07:50
That's because he can charge to do interviews
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:52:47
I never got that impression
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:21:53
What is it?
Send me an invite
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:06:11
Do nothing
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:19:11
What's up with the random retard?
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:48:40
Simple regression, they all get lost eventually
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:01:09
If the market knew this, the date would shift
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:37:13
Firsts system outtage would end it
@_date: 2014-09-20 18:10:48
That's a whole lot of speculation from a dude that's not rich
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:50:28
That was a sell trigger for a lot of folks
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:21:05
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:00:36
Its bullshit. Lots of guys making random guesses with no logical reason as to why.
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:02:13
Those are stores of wealth, you don't make money with them
@_date: 2015-01-14 08:05:40
All markets are. Only those taking a cut make money
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:57:25
Lots of auto sales at $200
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:33:06
If you stretched the meaning and only count the times it worked, sure
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:30:36
What about the fraction of a cent days?
I could be richer than a drug lord had I hodl
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:35:39
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:41:40
I assume you have a gaming license
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:51:12
Maybe you are confused, but yet it is.
OP posted a question that will only get self-selected anecdotal answers that are useless.
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:47:35
Likely a violation of terms and will get you shut down
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:26:00
That's called bootstrapping, some people can't just ask daddy for $50k to drop on speculative bets
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:45:20
But only on bitcoin
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:42:35
First off, even if it were a possibility of being true, they would have no way of confirming it. 
Second, the Rx 480 is used for eth mining.
Third, there is no 480x. 
Try to research things before asking basic questions
@_date: 2016-07-31 22:25:26
You don't spend your savings, that's why it's even more of a joke
@_date: 2016-07-25 04:51:07
the chinese have taken over with antpool and the s9 (and other machines they have in development)
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:39:01
Circle is the easiest and always gives market rate
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:54:19
Yep. Average Joe is just going to go to job town and get a job at the job store making 100k for 5 years before they can afford to drop 50k
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:52:48
Yes, if you move the goalpost to include +-20% and ignore all the huge failures. Kinda like those assholes who scream "I told you so!" When they finally get something right and forgot all the times they were wrong.
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:38:24
word salad
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:31:52
Your statement is pure speculation
@_date: 2016-07-13 23:22:52
@_date: 2016-07-14 22:39:23
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:49:42
Ever used a credit or debit card? Same thing, tjat's how money works.
