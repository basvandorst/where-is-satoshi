You are right on. Inflationary economics is why our planet is fucked, it's why our mental health is fucked. It leads to ultra consumerism which leads to pollution and consumers who aren't in any way fulfilled.  Fuck inflationary economics.  Those who argue that we need inflation are arguing that society is dependent on consumerism.

I have no idea.  I do know that as soon as you turn the thing on your seed was loaded into memory in plain text.  From the medium article it seems like there is no software fix for it.  The fact that something so obvious could be overlooked concerns me.    
Medium Article:  
Here is an article about a guy who lost his password and used the hack to restore his seed without any credentials.  It's a great read also:

Anyone else completely miss the mtgox claim process?  I fell asleep on crypto for a few years and missed the chance to claim.  Bummer.

I was right there with you until I saw how easily a trezor can be hacked if stolen/lost.  I caved and bought the ledger.  Yes, the Ledger guy is a major asshole.

Thats good to know.  It still a bit concerning, not sure what to believe really.  I know the guy who posted the original exploit posted a second article after the fix stating that there were still security issues.  Fuck, I don't know what to believe anymore.  I realize anything can be hacked and I am sure in time someone will find an exploit for ledger as well.
