Now that you put it that way, it does sound kind of funny! Everyday trading Bitcoin I say to myself 'what the hell am I doing?' Lol ...

You can short CFDs at this HK exchange: 796 xChange
On their website they call them 'Futures' but they are really Contracts-for-difference. Offers 10x1 leverage, so for example if you deposit one BTC, you can short up to 10 contracts.
I've found the service to be very good - best shorting option I've found.

Mt. Gox, by history and happenstance, was too closely tied to Silk Road. Ultimately that was the exchange's undoing. Sort of pre-ordained ...

I trade CFDs a bit on a HK exchange called '796 xchange.' Their website English version is not that great - they refer to CFD-like instruments as 'Futures,' which I think puts a lot of English speakers off. Still, I started small and have been trading their for a while. Customer service has been top notch for me, and no downtime or withrawal issues to speak of. Perhaps they benefit from a small user base. Hopefully that will grow gradually so they can manage it. I'd recommend having a look, trade a bit small-scale to get comfortable.

Mark needs to tell people their coins &amp; cash are safe, or if their not, give us an honest assessment, even if it is uncertain.

For those less familiar, Caixin is similar (read: Not the Same, just Similar) to the WSJ in terms of reliability/sources in China. I work in financial services in China.
This is for real.

Is this statement for real?? Really? That is how we are going to find out Mt. Gox is insolvent? 
Is this for real?

The US will ban Bitcoin just like it did online Poker. Remember that? Why ban online poker?!? The argument is much stronger to ban Bitcoin, or very, very, heavily regulate it. My bet is that eventually it will be banned ... 
That is not to say I'm happy about it ... but that is the way the wind blows.

How can it possibly be good? They waited to the last minute, and made sure to go into hiding. I'm starting to hate Gox, and I don't even have an account there ...

How is volume there? I'm looking for CFD instruments with reasonable volume/spreads. Recommendations?
Sorry, I can't answer your original question. I've looked at Avatrade in the past, but it made no sense to trade a contract based on Gox ... and if memory serves, they didn't have sufficient volume.

So basically property rights are not recognized, or not recognizable when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Certainly strikes me as a huge drawback to this asset class.

Checked them out over the weekend. Withdrawals are too slow. They sit on withdrawal requests for a few days as a matter of policy. It is the Singaporean way ... when it comes to banking anyway.

I appreciated your posts Twobit. You made the market more efficient, egalitarian ... thanks. Trolls are annoying, I know ... shake 'em off, and thanks.

Mark may have kept hard-copies of the private keys, and those hard copies were stolen. Maybe the crook(s) haven't withdrawn them yet because they haven't figured out how to cover their trail yet. Anything is possible ...
Tibanne the cat ate the keys! Rummage through his litter box ... might turn up something.

Once upon a time you could deposit fiat, so there is legacy fiat on the exchange. But the fiat is stuck there because currently fiat neither goes in nor comes out.

"Long-time Bitcoin advocate and investor ..." he looks like he's 13 years old! Nothing in Bitcoin has been long-term at that. Give us break ...

Mt. Gox is subject to both an investigation (wherein customer funds are being held ransom by the US government), and also subject to a lawsuit that poses an existential threat. I'm sure Kandi CEO has been advised by his legal representation to keep his mouth shut. THAT is also in Gox' customer's interest. Still, I agree, he should be able to draft something that addresses these questions.

I have lived and worked in China off and on for several years, with some experience with fraud investigation.
I guarantee you more than a few miners have 'relationships' with friends/contacts at large state-owned enterprises, including power generators, who essentially give the electricity for 'free,' or more accurately for a kickback or 'profit sharing.'
The crux is that public, state-owned, assets (electricity) are being misappropriated for private gain. China is one big kleptocracy ... and that is just how it works there.
Now in China this is all presented as normal business practice, which is true in China. When, however, foreigners want to understand how miners have access to essentially 'free' electricity, we can put it more clearly. 
Yeah, and a lot of this electricity is generated by COAL ... contributing to the apocalyptic air quality in that country. People in the major cities are afraid to let their kids go outside it is so bad. 
So 'f*ck the masses, lets make some coin!' is the motto more or less

People aren't going to like this answer, but my working assumption is that Bitcoin was launched, and largely managed by the NSA. SAtoshi Nakamoto ...
NSA launched BTC because they understood a cryptocurrency would be launched eventually and it was in the ageny's interest to capture first mover advantage.
A lot of people don't like that prospect, but I would bet BTC on it. How would his identity remain remain concealed for so long? NYT/WaPo editorial staff know the truth, and they've pledged secrecy because BTC is an ongoing tool for intel gathering ...
