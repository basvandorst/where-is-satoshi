If I could buy altcoins with Chinese yuan, I would. But I can't. Chinese authorities have made it almost impossible for cryptocurrency exchanges to operate here. I've got no bone to pick with Ripple. It lets me move money from my Chinese bank to my American bank, and if I time the transfers right, for no fees.

I would recommend using part of your next paycheck to open a bank account at a credit union, locally owned bank or Ally.com (an Internet bank that I use). You can usually open an account with $25 or so. Once you have a bank account in use for several weeks, you can link it to a Coinbase account.

Think Progress featured a column recently that said Bitcoin was created by privileged people for privileged people. She said nothing about how Bitcoin could help the underprivileged, because there is no one AFAIK pushing this idea in the media. We need to explain exactly how Bitcoin could help the "unbanked" and the working poor. Why is Bitcoin better than a check cashing service or a regular bank?
Or, could we convince a check cashing service to add Bitcoin as an option, alongside money wires and bill paying services?

I disagree, too. Before China cracked down on moving yuan to BTC on the domestic exchanges, I was able to go from CNY to BTC to USD with little to no loss because of arbitrage and rising BTC values. With the crackdown here in full force, I now use Ripple as an intermediate step, and the exchanges I use do not require verification unless I am moving a lot of money around. I am already verified at Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 15:50:49
Roger that. The VISA credit card (debit cards are a no-go) is just to enable instant buy.
But instant buy only applies if you are using Coinbase to buy BTC. If you're buying at a Swedish exchange, there will be no delay in depositing  BTC.

I live in China, and have been using PayPal for such transfers.  The whole wire transfer thing was a big pain in the ass for me, also. Yesterday I tested using Bitcoin with Coinbase.com, which seems to cleared all the AML and KYC hurdles in the USA. 
Because I haven't a Visa credit card to link to my Coinbase account, there is 4 day delay between the time I withdraw from Coinbase and the time it's deposited into my US bank account. With PayPal, it's seldom more than 2 business days.
PayPal charges about 4% for the international transfer. With Bitcoin, there are no such fees. Coinbase and my bank (Ally) charge only 1-1.5% for the electronic deposit. So, of course using Bitcoin will be cheaper in the long run.
Some banks seem OK with Bitcoin business. Others, not so much. I'd suggest asking your BoA branch manager before you attempt a Bitcoin transfer. As for other banks, Ally seems to be cool with my transfers to and from Coinbase, but they have been very small -- less than $50. 
As for the bank vs. credit union question, it should make no difference for using Coinbase. The big question is whether your bank or credit union will permit Bitcoin transfers.

Let me jump in here. I've used the "quick voucher" offered through yijingdong.com.
Start from BTC-China's English homepage. Go to Fund CNY. Click the Red rectangle for Yi Jing Dong. The order form will be in English. Fill in amount, bank name, etc. Click NEXT.
To proceed, you have to have a Chinese bank account with online banking enabled. My bank is CCB, and I have to use a USB dongle for online banking. Once you confirm payment with online banking, the CNY you ordered on the voucher will automatically appear in your BTC-China balance.
@_date: 2014-03-29 04:36:52
There will probably be a workaround with vouchers to put an additional "wall" between the exchanges and the banks. There are already systems in place for that.
@_date: 2014-06-01 15:15:37
BTC-China has English speaking support staff. Ask to speak to one. You shouldn't have verification delays if you are not converting to fiat and merely moving Bitcoin in or out.
Also, there is an English option for the website. Look in the top right corner.

Let me put in my 2 cents. I got into Bitcoin in December when the price was about $860. My initial investment was quite small, and I bought more as the price rose and fall. I've got about 0.3 BTC, and a smattering of LTC and other altcoins. It represents money I was willing to risk and money I didn't need. My hope, naturally, is that prices will rise above $860 again, and I will have made a nice profit.
I never traded on Mt. Gox, luckily, though I did start an account there. So, I didn't get stung by its problems. It's just one exchange among many, and the other exchanges -- BTC-China, Bitstamp, among others -- are still in business, unaffected only by the trading volumes they're seeing after Mt. Gox's collapse. The Bitcoin ecosystem survives.
But you know, this is all uncharted territory. Bitcoin may be the next big thing, and it will be worth risking some money now and riding the wave up. Or, Bitcoin could be a massive failure, and investing in it will be a total loss. I'm betting it will be successful, so I'm staying in. No risk, no reward.
You asked about safety. The Bitcoin technology is sound. But as they say in the automotive world, it's the nut behind the wheel that's the weak link. A poorly run exchange, an unprotected wallet, a compromised home PC, these could lead to all your bitcoins going bye-bye, never to return. If you're careful, and you choose reputable service providers, then it's safe. Not as safe as a bank, but not as risky as betting the horses or playing the slots.
So, my advice is spend about $100, or whatever money you can live without, or 1% of your disposable income, as Cody Willard suggests, and buy some Bitcoin at Coinbase, Bitstamp, BTC-E or whatever is most convenient for you.

I work in China, but am a US citizen. I have tested using Bitcoin to send money from my Chinese bank account to my US bank account. I've used PayPal in the past for the same purpose. The Bitcoin process is 1/4th the cost of using PayPal. How well it works for you depends on which countries you are talking about.

China is already one of the largest buyers and miners of Bitcoin. Chinese law restricts how much money can be taken out of the country or exchanged for other currencies, like USD or euros. Bitcoin gives wealthy Chinese -- or any Chinese -- a way to move money out of China and maybe make some money, too. Interestingly ,the government has made it inconvenient to buy Bitcoin, but not impossible.

The writer is Chinese, and he hits the nail on the head with this article.  I'd say, as someone who lives in China, that his description of the situation is accurate, as best as anyone can interpret the actions of the government regulators. The government here does not explain why it does things, and you don't ask. You try to divine the reasons why and try the best way to comply without having your head handed to you.

People in Mexico can now send and receive bitcoins at their local convenience stores using their cellphones. So, someone working in the USA can easily send funds home without paying Western Union fees. M-PESA in Africa works in a similar way, although without bitcoins.

Central bank regulations would probably prevent it. The government does not want to make it easy for the general population to obtain Bitcoin. ATMs would allow people to pull RMB out of circulation and move funds offshore and/or exchange it for convertible currencies like the dollar or euro.
China has strict capital controls on the RMB. The entire economy depends on the RMB being weak against the dollar, but not *too* weak.
@_date: 2014-05-26 04:37:20
I'll tell you one use for Ripple: it's about the only way I can easily buy Bitcoins in China. So far, China's banking authorities have ignored Ripple and XRP, so I can buy Ripple funding vouchers online, trade CNY for XRP, then XRP for BTC. Finally, I can exchange BTC for USD if I want. On a rising market, any conversion fees paid are wiped out by rising BTC values. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:41:04
Thanks for the snark. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 03:40:04
I didn't phrase that too well. I mean the ATMs will move RMB into another currency (BTC) that the central bank can't keep track of or control. Of course, the ATM's *operators* are going to use the deposited RMB.
China tightly controls its currency's value against the dollar; it doesn't float. Likewise, there are limits on how much RMB individuals can exchange for foreign currencies. So, an ATM in China would probably require ID for transactions and the central bank would want ATM  operators to prevent users from exceeding the exchange limits.

I am in China and have used the YJD vouchers, but not the others. I did a spot check of some on the TaoBao shopping site, and most of those seem to have disappeared. In other words, BTC-China still has the links, but the vendor is not offering the vouchers.
In any event, most of the vendors would expect payment through Alipay or Tenpay (Chinese payment processors that require linking to a domestic bank account), or by transfer from a domestic bank account.
Strangely, there is still an option for domestic bank transfer available. I'm not sure whether that will be available after the 15th, given all the FUD recently. 
I should note that my account is a domestic use account. If you have an international account, YMMV.
I had bitcoins and litecoins at BTC-China. As a precaution, I have withdrawn them to my private wallets.

It can be evaded as long you don't convert back to fiat and make a bank deposit. FATCA-compliant banks have to report your account balance to the IRS, and any large deposit will raise questions among the IRS gnomes.
But not all banks are compliant (yet), so check before depositing.
@_date: 2014-03-13 07:58:31
I've done a similar comparison, but I also factored in the time required. PayPal takes 3-4 business days to deposit to a US bank account, while Coinbase takes about 2 business days. Coinbase and my US bank charge about 1-2% for ACH deposit. PayPal charges about 4% for international exchange/transfer. As you say, PayPal is competitive with Bitcoin at the moment.
BTW, I am transferring from China to the USA, so my experience may be slightly different from yours.

Some banks have partnerships with foreign banks. BoA and China Construction Bank do (since one owns part of the other), but there are no BoA branches in my part of the USA, so it doesn't help much.
My wire transfers took less than a week, though. Fees were about $30.
@_date: 2014-02-02 03:41:21
It's the same here in China. You can even do transfers  ATMs. When I came here from the States, I was amazed at how easy it was. Chinese banks also give you a USB dongle for extra online banking security. It makes up for the difficulty in getting Visa or Mastercard here.

This has become a very common question here. As long as you don't have banks that would throw a wrench in the works, it can work. There was some news report recently about Dutch bank authorities warning people away from Bitcoin, so you'd better ask your Dutch bank if they have a policy about Bitcoin.
I have used Ripple and Bitcoin to move money from China to the USA fairly successfully, but my amounts are low 100's of dollars, not 1000's. I've only taken a loss once, because of falling prices. I waited too long to convert to dollars. But I would have lost the same amount with the more traditional methods through fees, so I didn't cry over it.

AFAIK, this law concerns "black market" currency exchanges operating without a license. These shops would be trading RMB for dollars, for example. China does not have any laws yet regarding trading RMB for Bitcoin, so BTC-China can operate within the law. It does not exchange RMB for dollars or other fiat, you see. The exchange into dollars (or whatever) happens at another exchange, and China doesn't care about that.

Are you trying to exchange from AUD to USD while in either country? If so, then you'll still probably will need to pay a fee (or be charged a fee) when you convert to or from fiat. 
But, if you are sending money from Oz to the USA via Bitcoin, then you would only pay the fiat-to-crypto exchange fees.
I'm an American and I work in China. I have bought Bitcoin with Chinese yuan, send the Bitcoin to Coinbase, and sold it at CB for USD for deposit in my US bank. I've done it twice so far, and each time came out ahead because of arbitrage and rising Bitcoin values. YMMV

I jumped on the Bitcoin wagon when the price was around $860. I bought a tiny amount. That was just before the first Chinese clamp-down on trading. Since then, despite all the turmoil, Bitcoin has not crashed much below $500, so I've continued to buy and hold, and use it from time to time.

I'm an American living in China. The OP is correct. Buying bitcoins here is as easy as 1-2-3. BTC-China, where I have an account, will accept direct bank deposits for amounts over 2,000 yuan (about US$330 now). For smaller amounts, you can buy vouchers online to fund your account, using the Alipay payment system.
So far, none of the mainland exchanges have adopted KYC/AML procedures, which helps the process go so smoothly. They assume that your Chinese bank has done the legwork to verify your identity and trustworthiness.
However, the new exchange in Hong Kong (ANXBTC.com) does have KYC/AML procedures in place.

UnionPay for most Chinese was the only debit card they could get, until the government relaxed the rules limiting Visa, Mastercard, etc. Even then,  the banks are reluctant to hand out Western debit/credit cards.

I'll give it a shot, though I'm not an expert by any means.
Mt Gox for the last several weeks has been really slow getting withdrawals out to customers. They offered no clear explanations why there were such delays. Then, last week, Mt Gox said they were suspending Bitcoin withdrawals until Feb 10 to fix some problems with their systems. Supposedly, taking withdrawals offline would help them correct the issue. All other trading activity went on as usual.
Yesterday, Mt Gox had two other announcements. (1) Bitcoin withdrawals were still suspended, and (2) the problem does not originate with Mt Gox but with the blockchain protocols. Many Bitcoin experts are not buying the second statement, as the withdrawal problems seem to be limited only to Mt Gox.
A related concern for the last several weeks is the higher exchange rates at Mt Gox compared to other exchanges. That encouraged traders to buy low at another exchange, and try to sell high at Mt Gox. But, then they couldn't withdraw their funds, or withdrawals would take days to complete.
As for Dwolla, it's avoiding Bitcoin probably for legal reasons, given the bad press Bitcoin has gotten after the Silk Road and BitInstant scandals. Dwolla might also be scared of the market's volatility, or of Bitcoin being a competing money transfer/payment system. 
I hope I've got the broad picture correct.

I think first you would need to establish a relationship with a local bank first, to let your customers exchange local currency for Bitcoin.
