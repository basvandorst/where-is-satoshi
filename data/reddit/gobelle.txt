No need to click the link if you don't want it. Here's a description of our featured product:
“Give yourself a chance at becoming wealthy by discovering cryptocurrencies with great potential before everyone else”. The book is written by the main author from Gamblers United, with help from two other early investors and developers. After reading the first chapters you’ll be extremely up to date with all the technologies available at the moment when developing a cryptocurrency. It will even go over the ones that are theoretical and not yet implemented. The book uses modern retention techniques in order to make sure that you are actually able to use this knowledge, not just forget 95% of what you read after each page. I won’t lie, this is the hard part. Everything is well explained though and I was able to go through the information in the draft without losing hope. The authors debate which of these technologies offer the most value and try to rank them. Then the real fun begins: you’ll receive the rest of the tools and information that you need in order to identify the next hyper growing cryptocurrencies and support their bubble. Some will be worth pennies at the moment but will have huge potential of hitting it big. You will look at real life examples: things that have been done in the past in order to support or devalue cryptocurrencies; no one is talking about some of these methods. You will become an expert in the field. As part of the thesis that you are recommended to write while completing this book, the authors will lead you to analyze certain cryptocurrencies yourself and discover if you can spot the winners and the losers. Then they will put you to action to actually make money off the winners. But they won’t be winners forever. The competition is huge, new technologies appear all the time and some cryptocurrencies are not able to evolve fast enough. For this reason, it will help you decide when to cash out. Selling at the right moment is of extreme importance. The book won’t be an analysis of existing cryptocurrencies that are making obvious waves already (f.e. Ethereum), but it will also teach you how to look into existing dapps and see where there’s money to be made.

Based on the feedback that I forwarded to the authors in the last few days, the series name has been changed to be more accurate and the prod. desc. updated. [Check it out here!](

Why this hate on evolution? I've noticed it on many people from r/bitcoin. May the best coin win, but try to be objective while this happens. Some coins are quite exquisite technologies. Confirmation bias and conservatorism will bring you shitlife, where you don't truly understand what's happening around you.

We'll change it completely for next month. I had a huge headache with our current layout, I know it's not always displayed well... Thank you a ton for the feedback and tips.

We'll be implementing 10 more cryptocurrencies and we'll try to differentiate of the competition through: unique designs (we sell a product only once), donating to charities and accepting only cryptocurrencies as a method of payment.

It's 100% sterling silver. I have made the correction. Thank you!

they've started on GoBelle as well
@_date: 2016-02-05 00:03:21
To be honest I did not know how to implement that but I am looking into it. Have a lovely week and thank you!

You're way of thinking is extremely similar to mine. I'm getting that book and of course I'm also anxiously waiting for OpenBazaar to go live. Your messages are extremely motivating, thank you!

Thank you so much for the mention!
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:35:15
Thank you so much for your feedback. It means a lot to me. I will also make the change that you suggested as soon as possible. I think I have to look up a plugin for multicurrency support, so the user may choose what currency he wants displayed.

You're absolutely correct. I don't share their views either :P

Thanks! First we're testing with a few designs. If the interest is there, we'll add more in the future.

We'll have a better layout next month, the website will look and feel better on all devices.
