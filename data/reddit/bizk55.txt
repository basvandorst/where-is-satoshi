Looks like he went to Nigeria, south Africa and Ghana as they were the most popular places for Google searches for bitcoin. So, Gott go where the strengths are I guess

Bitcoin is a type of _cryptocurrency_, as is EOS. This is also the bitcoin subreddit, and there are also other subreddits dedicated to their cryptocurrency as well (ethereum, ripple, etc). So the thing is people on here are more likely going to tell you bitcoin is the best, and to ignore everything else, but you should look into it more yourself. My advice though, don't get anything until you know more about what  you're buying first.

I think this is more just a comment of an immature marketplace that initially was easily persuaded by marketing. But surely since then ethereum and others have matured, and at the end of the day only the best and most useful blockchain tech will survive

If bitcoin were "only" 20,000...

Well personally I think if his advice is for educated people to go all in on anything is reckless and a little stupid. Maybe he could also be speaking from a perspective of survivor bias, or maybe he just doesn't admit he's made mistakes, but I think smart people think in probabilities, not black and white, so its probably better for most people to diversify. 
And sure, the risk of owning any company is effected by the national and international economy (as are the benefits...), but diversity is the answer to that too: you have some allocation in the stock market, some in precious metals and/or bitcoin, some in cash under your mattress...

It lowers both your upside and downside potential, it's a trade off, sure. And good luck to those who it works for, but then, there are people who it doesn't, so that's why I personally choose to spread my money around a bit

He's just trying to get headlines. He said to the average person: pay off your debts and just go all into cash and hoard consumable items like toothpaste. His reasoning: you can't beat the big players. Well what if I don't want to beat them? What if I just want to put my money to work a bit better than my savings account does? Diversity just helps me mitigate the risk of a single bad choice. Even he must understand that if he put his money in SPY and DJI.
