This sucks, I know that the only way that you think that bitfinex could survive is take everyones money and make bitcoiners as whole as possible. I didn't have any bitcoin but only had ltc and eth, I really don't think i should be punished, not to mention, good luck trying to trade 20 million of each ltc, eth, and etc for btc  recovery. You're gonna crash all the alt coins you hold and pump bitcoin. And your exchange is still dead.

You can't have a market without an orderbook and you can't have a true orderbook without keeping coins on an exchanges. Simple as that. So if everyone didn't keep their coins on exchanges (like loves to tell people) then there really wouldn't be a true btc/usd price and all we would have would be brokers like coinbase and bitpay which really doesn't sound like the money of the future. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 21:27:04
It's not a matter of principle or morals. It's a practical issue, if cryptocurrency is too slippery to effectively allow for exchanges its not worth anything. Bitcoin is only valuable as a means of value transfer because it can be exchanged for dollars.

Was torn between a gs4 and nexus 4 but felt that the n4 was a bit underpowered and when they announced the google edition I jumped.

Kickstarter backer *do* have legal recourse, sue the creators. This, of course, does not help alot of people with kickstarters that fail for two big reasons. 
1. Most kickstarters are of relatively small amounts of money (eg this guy and his $40,000) so the cost of bringing such a class action simply aren't worth it. The people who actually put up the money would get but a tiny fraction unless you could get a judgment against kickstarter itself. 
2. Even if you could get a judgement at a reasonable cost as plaintiff, these kickstarter scammers seem to be uncollectable for the most part. So even when the judge says you have to give refunds, theres no money to refund left to the guys name. This guys appears to be homeless.

The cases they reference were a bit different than what is alleged. The nView and Number Nine cases had to do with people who bought the companies' stock in anticipation of a product release and they sued under a securities regulation.
I applaud their attorney for digging up *something* that says BFL's conduct was ok but I don't think a judge will buy it since they couldn't find anything that had to do with actual products being ordered, paid for, and shipment times being misrepresented.

A common (especially among coins that have fast confirmation times) example of a soft-fork that occurs often enough would be a two miners finding blocks at the same time. Thus you could say that there are two sets of transactions that have 1 confirmation. The ambiguity is resolved when the next block is found and thus one set of transactions is now 'reversed' and the other set now has two confirmations. Eventually the 'reversed' transactions will be included in a later block, since they go back into the pile of unconfirmed transactions.

Lets do some math, I've picked a bet on satoshidice that is easy to do the math. The third to last bet is a 50% bet with a payout of .965 of the original bet. So lets start with the minimum bet, of 0.001BTC, if you follow the martingale system then you could lose 17 times in a row before you reach the maximum bet of 100 BTC, the odds of losing 17 times in a row would be 0.5^17 or 7.2*10^-6. meaning it would be extremely rare for that to happen.  But you'd only be winning 0.000965BTC, you might as well just milk various 'faucets' for more BTC. 
If you make a bet of say 1BTC, you'd only have 7 chances total to win. 
TLDR: The maximum limits truly hinder your ability to do the martingale strategy for any real amounts of btc.

You might as well go with green addresses imho.

Its really not hard as long as you keep to a few central rules. The equipment is pretty cheap, you can buy a decent glass beer kit for $130 and then all you need is some bottles (you can reuse beer bottles from pretty much any manufacturer) and ingredients. I was lucky when I first brewed beer there was a local homebrew place that had basically made up recipes for pretty much every kind of microbrew you can think of and sold recipe kits with everything you need for that kind of beer with simple instructions. It was pretty cheep $30 for everything except the water for a 5 gallon brew.

The law is pretty clear about this sort of thing. If you have something of value (bitcoins do have value) and then they disappear when they weren't supposed to, the law has something to say about itt. Just because the medium of transaction has changed doesn't mean the law will just surrender. It may be helpful to just think of bitcoin as a foreign currency. If I make a contract to invest my swiss francs in the US and the money disappears then I can still sue and recover. 
Some crimes off the top of my head in the US:
* Theft/Fraud for the disappearance of the bitcoins.
* Operating without SEC license for investment vehicle or banking charter. This will depend on how the courts think he should be classified as (bank or investment). 
He is also liable for the missing bitcoins under tort law (civil not criminal). It would be for the tort of conversion.

Hmmmm, now that i read 1010.100 again and what you want to do, I don't think you need to get FinCEN to make any judgement in your case. Let me explain: 
I'm assuming that you (MYL) would be taking donated bitcoins, selling them on mtgox and then withdrawing via bankwire, or dwolla  and then distributing them to the selected political interests, right?
Well your bank or dwolla do have money transmitters licenses or exceptions (banks get MTL's as part of their bank charters). So they would be checking for all the money laundering. You don't need to do any checking anymore than does your local PBS station when they get donated cars.

The difference between now and the last huge increase in difficulty (from 6/11-9/11) is there is no huge appreciation in price as there was then. The current trend in growth is not people madly rushing in to make a few quick bitcoins. Its more long term investment which begets more investment. Atleast thats my interpretation. 50x may seem like alot now, but I think within 2 years of the release of ASIC's we will certainly see 1 PH/s

Not as much as people think. Some say that SR is the 'killer app' for bitcoin but I would argue that Satoshidice is the true killer app for bitcoin. Considering that satoshidice transactions consist of 55% of *all* the transactions of the bitcoin block chain I would say that its the biggest mover of the bitcoin market. 
On an unrelated note, satoshidice has lost almost 4000 bitcoins to gamblers from oct-14 to oct-27. I wouldn't be surprised if a lot of the volatility in the btc/usd price is due to gamblers cashing out.

You don't pick a correspondent bank. Your bank picks its correspondent banks. Wires work via a P2P like system. Bank A wants to send to Bank C but they don't have accounts with each other but they do both have accounts with Bank B. So Bank B acts an intermediary. Often there are many more banks in-between. Wells Fargo is unfortunately big enough that they end up being a correspondent bank in all kinds of stuff.

Well I think the judges are still out on the butterflylabs miners, since no one has actually seen them and the hash rate seems way too high considering the actual alternatives.  W/Hashs is their big advantage but their upfront costs are much high than GPU mining. 
I think the balance is how long do you want to mine bitcoins, if you're in it for the long haul then get the fpga's if not stick to gpu's.

Now, if i did intend to kill them it would make it worse for me but it doesn't change that I killed some one and I'm guilty.

Considering Iranian proclivities to be overly suspicious of everything, and the fact that gavin gave a presentation to in-q-tel (the venture capital arm of the CIA), I somehow doubt Iran would be buying into this. Plus the bitcoin market would have a hard time coping with the ~100 billion USD market value of the annual iranian exports. 
Not to mention there would have to be an oil refiner willing to risk getting caught refining iranian oil and willing to  buy and sell in BTC since iran doesn't actually refine most of its crude (they're actually net importers of refined gasoline).

Thats a tough question since so many of those assets were very illiquid, you can go through the cached versions of alot of the assets and do some guestimating. Lets look at, [gigamining]( which was one of the most liquid stocks on there, had issued 40,000 shares and they were going at around 0.6BTC/share when GLBSE went down. That works out to 24000 BTC for the whole operation and a USD value of about 288,000. I would guess that the whole market was capitalized around a million USD or so, give or take a couple hundred thousand. In short, a decent chunk of change, enough to get authorities involved.

Copyright could fit, and along with the DMCA it would be protected (legally speaking) against many legal attacks against the bitcoin system. Consider the requirements for a copyright in the US:
1. "original": Obviously cryptographic keys are original, its why they're useful.
2. "work of authorship": this is where it gets tricky, it doesn't fall under traditional definitions of authorship, though I could see the courts ruling that the process, even if mechanical, of generating a key would be considered authorship. If you want to read more on this topic there is [this paper](
3. "fixed in a tangible medium of expression, now known or later developed" : hard drives and computer memory count as tangible mediums of expression.
As a side note, copyright does not literally require creativity. The courts aren't really equipped to determine creativity and theres been no court ruling AFAIK that says a computer can't be creative. The only ruling where creativity was a real issue was [Feist v. Rural]( and they ruled that a simple list of alphabetical facts (in this case phone numbers) was not copyrightable. If they had organized the telephone numbers into any other order (perhaps by city then alphabetically) then it would have been copyrightable.

From the perspective of the gambler it's not risky if you deposit to unique addresses (eg your site of choice lets you create a new address every time you want to make a deposit). It's a little different with sites like satoshidice because the addresses are public and thus its much easier to identify the activity as gambling. If you're using satoshidice and you're uber paranoid then do it over tor and/or use a mixing service to obfuscate the origin of the coins.

This is definitely a case of the government stretching the law to get rid of something they simply don't like rather a genuine breaking of the law. 
If you read the indictments, it hinged on the fact the coins and certificates  used terms and imagery similar to those used on US coins and bills (liberty, the flame from the statue of liberty, in god we trust, dollar, etc). If Von NotHaus hadn't use those he would have likely been able beat the case.

1. If you think this is unfair, I'd love to hear your opinion on how unfair it is for the average investor to get his hands on the Facebook IPO. Just like with stock, people who took extremely high risks early on are rewarded the most. If there's a better way to bootstrap a currency, I'd love to hear it.
2. Topping out at 21 million in 22 years from now is relatively quick?! If bitcoin is still around and being used in 2033, It will have to be considered a success. Bitcoin is designed to mimic a commodity currency and is in fact more commodity like than any commodity. After all no one will discover a new source of bitcoin, like what happened to silver after the Comstock Lode was discovered. The graph of bitcoin supply versus tweets is highly deceptive and amounts to a straw man's argument. 
3. Bitcoin is about as convertible as any other non-major national currency. The exchanges buy and sell about 600K USD in the past 24H period. On heavy volume days the market has topped out by a factor of 10. Is that alot? For a startup currency, I'd say thats amazing. 
4. Plenty of things went wrong during the great depression, was the government able to backstop everything in time? No, thats why it's called the great depression.  Just because we've planned for the last crisis doesn't mean we're ready for the next. We've seen it time and time again "we always fight the last war". Between flash crashes of stocks due to high frequency trading, or the ever continuous slump we're in, I don't think the government is able to provide the security you want.

The only people that could tell you with any certainty would be butterfly labs since it will be mostly their ASIC's that will power the huge increase in difficulty. My best guess is that total hashing power will go up something like 50x. Atleast mine will since I'm going from 2x BFL singles to 2x BFL SC's. You have to consider that alot of smaller miners will drop out as will some of the botnets as its probably too much of a pain to maintain a botnet thats giving .0001 btw/day if the price of btc is stable in the 10-20$ range. 
Edit: Some quick math, Hashrate is directly proportional to difficulty, so a 50x increase in hashrate will lead to a 50x increase in difficulty. So Roughly a difficulty of 140,000,000, we're at ~2800000 at the next difficulty reset.

A Jury has to evaluate if the average person (not you, I, or your gold bug uncle) with no ideas about alternative currencies would mistake it for US fiat. Its  reasonable to think that the average idiot, if presented with a silvery coin that says "liberty", "dollar", has a statue of liberty head, and is told that this is US currency might say, sure it is. Thats counterfeiting under the law. This isn't to say the jury was right, I would have gone with a not guilty with the information I have now. Anyways, its not like the US government has shut down the production or use of silver rounds or bars. You can still buy and use them as you please just not silver or gold that resembles US currency.
 
I don't think this has all that much to do with bit coin.

Bitcoin is all about putting the individual back in control of his or her money.

Just a thought on legal strategy, feel free to correct me if I have it wrong. If you call bitcoins commodities you may be in danger of FinCen considering them to be like precious metals which does requires FinCen reporting according to 31 CFR § 1027. I'm guessing you're trying to put them in the same category as non-precious metal commodities like copper, wheat, or pig bellies.

Home depot makes an old school app called 'crowbar' that could rob vending machines effectively.
But in seriousness, I get your point, I'm just saying the people that are gonna put effort into robbing a vending machine or using a stolen credit card on one aren't the smartest individuals around. Look at what keyless and hardened ignition systems have done for car theft rates (they have plummeted in the US). Why? because the guys that steal cars are not the ones with EE degrees who could figure out a way around the systems. If there were guys who could effectively manage to institute a double spend attack they aren't going after vending machines, they'll be going for something way bigger.

Not necessarily, if you send each donation separately to your exchange of choice then there won't be any pooling of funds that could connect separate  donations to a common owner.

Theft/loss: Very low if you follow good precautions such as make an offline wallet via ubuntu live cd, and save multiple copies on cd/usb/paper, etc. There are plenty of guides around for this.
Volatility: BTC is still a risky investment compared to things like bluechip stocks, US debt, etc. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.

There is huge price support at $12/btc so 12.50 seems reasonable for local minimum, but after than it seems much thinner, where it would end I don't know.

@_date: 2011-11-27 21:58:12
The way orders are filled is why this happens. When some one sells bitcoin they put a sell order in for lets say 50 btc @ $2.50. You want to buy 60 btc, so when you put in the order for 60 btc @ $2.50, the fifty bitcoins currently for sale get bought by you. If no one else is selling bitcoins for $2.50 then your remaining 10 btc goes into an open order and will only get filled when some one else is willing to sell 10+ btc@ $2.50. 
This is how the stock market works too but since the volumes are so much bigger you rarely run out of stocks to buy at the current sell price. 
If you want to see how this looks graphically check out [MtGox Live]( The  Mt Gox's native charts suck frankly. Hopefully their redesign will be better.

Ya after looking at PHP's crypt function it is clear mtgox used md5 + salt and I'm not exactly happy about it, I'm not familiar with the specific salting used by the crypt function but at this point EVERYONE should consider their passwords compromised and change any passwords that were the same. I'm not sure if blowfish or sha512 would have been a better choice but md5 sucks and should no be used by anyone just like DES should not be used.

@_date: 2011-06-16 02:10:22
The clearing part is tricky, One idea I had would be the person would show an address and the POS would check to see how many coins there were there already (like how you can check via block explorer) and just assume the person hadn't used those coins yet (afterall after one confirmation the coins would be gone, more confirmations just validate the transaction further). This would not be 100% fool proof as the person could have just withdrawn those coins already and the network not updated however they would have to have done that literally minutes before. For small transactions, eg a soda, I think merchants could just rely on that and fraud would probably be about the same as credit card fraud. For larger purchases, eg car, house, etc you could just wait the 30 mins for suitable confirmations.

Nothing like this exits (yet) and heres three reasons why:
The app store process is not friendly to bitcoins. As far as I know every effort to get an bitcoin app that has a wallet has failed to get approval. Though in principle I can't see how a bitcoin app is any different than a paypal/dwolla/etc app. 
On the technical side some people might not appreciate having to download the entire blockchain on their iphone or having it take up a tremendous space for a mobile phone (currently around 1GB) so you'd have to make a header-only client or 'selfish' client. Neither of which have been made yet. Also, I'm having a hard time understanding how an iphone is supposed to get a fingerprint. Voice verification would be possible but seems like a lot of trouble to go through when a password or pin would do.
Lastly, is bitcoin ready for the mainstream? making an iphone app would imply that and I don't think it is ready. Just my 2 bitcents.
That being said, try to make one, I'd buy it!

I don't think MtGox ever pretended to be some sort of anonymous bitcoin exchange. They want to turn bitcoin into THE virtual currency, displacing credit cards and paypal. Running an exchange facilitates that process of wider acceptance.

Why do you think that the CIA wants to destroy bitcoin? From my perspective it could be VERY useful to them on a number of levels. Here is a few possible uses the CIA may have for a developed economy that uses bitcoin:
* Paying operatives in hostile places, enabling them to purchase goods and getting around with essentially no ties to the CIA.
* It can be a tool to undermine foreign governments, by replacing the state currency with bitcoin. 
* It's fucking cool. I'm still amazed after being involved with bitcoin for 5 or 6 months about how well it actually works and how developed it has become, this is just the beginning, starting a currency from scratch is not easy. Let's not forget google earth was an in-q-tel (CIA) backed venture known as [keyhole](

I agree 100%. For those early adopters, they should not be content simply hanging on to their little piece of the pie but rather trying to increase the value of that pie by working on it further. The things to do list is huge for BTC. 
Lets start a list: a better, more user friendly, more secure client. A point of sale system possibly using QR codes, an official mobile application (could be integrated into a POS system), I know apple has rejected it thus far but atleast make a version for jail broken iphones. Android shouldn't be an issue.

I wouldn't consider the daily price to be reflective of the development of the currency. I'm not sure why you think bitcoin should be accepted enmass by the public at this moment. It will take time and work. The biggest hurdle to mass acceptance is ease of use, and that means beating credit cards and paypal. Im still waiting for an iOS and android app that allows IRL QR code transactions. Once there is the possibility to do bitcoin transactions from anywhere easily we can start using bitcoin more widely. 
The truth is that most people don't need to know how bitcoin works, but need to know that it *does* work.

Agreed. In a weird way, they kinda admitted bitcoin does have a place in the world, though they only concede that it is actually better in a limited scope.

I've thought about this too, this is what I've come up with:
It may be hard to consider it a foreign currency as it isn't attributable to any foreign government, organization or agency. While something may function as a currency (eg gold) it doesn't mean it is considered a currency. 
The commodity designation doesn't quite fit either because all commodities are physical things which ultimately have at least one other use than a store of value. 
Is bitcoin an equity? Not quite really, there is a common project or goal, and to a certain extent bitcoins can act as shares within the common project, however there are no assets that belong to the bitcoin project and no promise of returns for the bitcoins you mine or purchase. 
Does this mean one or another government won't just declare bitcoin to be a currency or commodity or equity by fiat? Nope, they could but on a logical level bitcoin does not fit any of the traditional definitions in finance.

Thats the nature of innovation, theres always a next greatest. Telegrams replaced the pony express, and telephones replaced telegrams, and the IP replaced phones, and something will replace IP. Change has no end. Why would bitcoin have the powers to change the nature of technological development?


This makes no sense. Just because bitcoin can be supplanted in popularity by an altcoin, doesn't mean that there isn't a finite supply of bitcoin. There still is a fixed amount of bitcoin. Ever since bitcoin came around people have made altcoins and most have failed, some have succeeded, and perhaps we're witnessing a changing of the guard now as bitcoin can't meet the demands placed on it. This is really bitcoin's game to lose and the lack of effective and decisive decision making is showing.

I made this mistake way back when I started in bitcoin, blew 20K on equipment, sure I made money but If i had bought 20k in bitcoin at the time I would have made waaaay more. Why would you sell a literal money printing machine? it only makes sense when you can get more for the machine than the money it can print. Mining only makes sense if you're making the machines either for you to use (much lower cost) or sell, never to allow some one else to make the money. 
TLDR: Mining almost **never** makes sense financially, just buy some bitcoin with that cash you would have blown on the latest and greatest mining rig

The current exchange rate makes it unprofitable. That's why you see the difficulty going down from the high of 1.8million to the current 1.6 mil. If the price stays at $4/btc the I think I'll only turn my miners (1.2 gh/s) back on around a difficulty of 1-1.2 mil.
Do the math but it's really not profitable to jump into mining until either the price goes up or difficulty goes down.

The way the credit card companies do that is by charging the merchant. So when I get my 1-3% back on my purchases that is coming out of the 2-4% that the merchant pays for accepting credit cards.

I think you're taking the optimistic view of bitcoin's long-term ramifications, which is good. I don't truly believe the theory i explained above simply because it's too clever and complex a long-con to pull off. 


The real long con wouldn't be that the dollar would go away but rather the US could keep printing dollars while maintaining a bitcoin reserve just like the US keeps a substantial gold reserve despite the lack of convertibility. That way the US could keep inflating the dollar (to wittle away debt) and still maintain economic credibility in the way that it's been doing since nixon. 
As to modifications to the protocol, while certainly possible, I don't see the kind of leadership needed to implement them in the main chain. People like Gavin are tremendously valuable as coders however I don't see them really taking the bull by the horns and innovating the apps and protocol in a forward-thinking strategic way. This is because they have to get consensus of all the miners and other app maintainers and they have an interest in maintaining the status quo ihmo. This isn't a jab against him or other developers because I know they do their best and the decisions they have to make aren't easy, especially when talking about how many vested interests there are. Rather it's a realization that having such a distributed process as bitcoin makes it very resistant to sabotage, but it also makes serious levels of further innovation *very* difficult.

US law school student here. It seemed cursory because it was. Its a ruling on a motion, not a ruling on a whole case so these tend to be pretty short since its pretty limited in scope.
Ill try to give a tldr on this matter. To sue in federal court you have to meet certain requirements depending on the circumstances. One way to get into federal court is to sue under a federal law. This is called subject matter jurisdiction because the subject matter of the suit is a federal law. Under federal law a security has to be registered with the SEC and it has to be truthful
 (ie it is what it is advertised as it is). Shavers was trying to argue that since bitcoin isn't a traditional currency that those regulations suddenly don't apply to him. I'm not surprised by the ruling and no one else should be. This isn't the federal courts endorsing bitcoin but rather a practical ruling on the nature of money. Money is whatever people want it to be and since we're here bitcoin is money.

Yup, just so we're clear on terminology:
* Standing - Whether the plaintiffs are allowed to sue
* Jurisdiction - Whether this should be in federal court, state court, a specialty court, or no court
* Venue - Once jurisdiction is decided, which actual court in that court system should hear it. Venue isn't an issue here.
The SEC isn't claiming that since bitcoin is money it's entitled to regulate bitcoin. The SEC is saying that since shavers created a security, it is entitled to regulate the security. Part of the reason that BCST shares are securities is because people paid money (bitcoin) to buy them. The shares are also securities because of the other two elements (Common enterprise and expectation of profits). 
I'll look through westlaw when I get a chance but I doubt there is much in the way of case law about what money is, mostly because this is a such rare issue. When a word is undefined in the statute, the judge is supposed to consider "ordinary or accepted usage" of the word as well as the context. Honestly, Shavers is gonna have a real hard time getting out of this me thinks.

Sorry, Your continued insistence that your calculations were valid was peeving me because I've seen way too much of it around when it comes to bitcoin mining. Price hasn't been increasing in a way that could compensate for the rise in difficulty. The difficulty has gone from 112million on 9/14 to 390 million on 10/26, an increase of 348% while price has gone from about $140 to $200 an increase of 42%. The price can keep going up at this rate but if difficulty keeps going up at its rate then everyone will be losing. 
Edit: The next retarget [estimate is around 480million]( right now so it doesn't seem like the growth in the network is gonna change too soon.

Why would the market price for chips spike?! If anything they would go lower as you can negotiate lower chip costs at larger scales. The semiconductor industry is massive, the bitcoin ASIC market is an incredibly tiny fraction of that and would have little effect on the overall market for ASIC production. 
@_date: 2013-02-08 00:54:47
Because of the grossly inflationary policies of the federal reserve, same reason bit coins at $22. Bitcoin is certainly more speculative than gold so its probably closer to silver than gold in volatility.

Think about why the guy is selling... He thinks he can get more money by selling rather than mining. As soon as you give him a price that is less than the unit would return to him then you've hit the right price. I personally wouldn't buy for more than 750USD per unit. Don't be afraid to 'insult' him. You have to bring him down to earth. You can point out how quickly they are depreciating. On Ebay they were going for 5000USD a month ago, they're going for about 2000USD. In another month they'll be going for $1000 or less.

Right now the US is inflating via two primary mechanisms. Under TARP the Fed can give low to no-interest loans directly to banks to make their balance sheets flush with cash. The second mechanism is the one where the fed is going out and buying mortgage back securities, basically buying mortgages. Ultimately the government is trying to keep prices up, which is the definition of inflation. It's been successful as housing prices have shown but in reality the banks have not been lending all this money they got directly through tarp, they've been hoarding it and the rise in house prices has come through the securities purchases. Thats why the fed started the bond buying, because the TARP loans weren't buoying house prices enough.
So the situation we have now, is stable and rising house prices everywhere and banks flush with cash. So its very reasonable to say that once those banks have developed enough confidence (1-2 yrs?), they will loan and once they all start loaning money it will become a flood leading too serious levels of inflation. 
If that inflation goes out of control, certainly possible, Bitcoin could rise tremendously in price and start actually destabilizing the USD, EUR, etc. well once that happens the US can come out and, 'hey, by the way, we have a couple million bitcoins'. Whats the effect? well bitcoin might surge in USD terms, but what happens to other currencies that don't have any BTC backing? They get crushed compared to the USD because of course a hyperinflationary spiral would have caused the same kind of inflation everywhere since every government holds USD in large amounts. Check and mate, the USD stays on top relatively. They never have to spend a single bitcoin. 
I don't think the US would really need to pull the bitcoin card if everything stays stable. And of course this is all dependent on a iffy proposition that the US already maintains a BTC reserve. 
Thats the end of my economic fantasy world.

True, do you think most people will go through these techniques to conceal their activity all the time? Few are as technically skilled as you.  Given the scope of NSA surveillance who is to say these are even guarantors of anonymity?


I don't think these statements are incompatible with the scenario I outlined. Having nearly total knowledge of all economic activity is tremendously powerful. Also, the gold standard is a great standard to be on when you have so much of all the gold out there.

Everyone will, thats the problem. The amount of bitcoins available to mine are on fixed schedule thus the more people that try to mine, the less any individual person ends up earning. It's related to the classic game theory example, the [tragedy of the commons]( In short, the tragedy of the commons is a situation where there is a fixed amount of resources (coins) and each individual actor can harvest (mine) those resources freely. The 'rational' actors will inevitably try to harvest those resources as quickly as possible (get the latest and greatest mining equipment) to gain an advantage over other actors. Thus leading to a situation where mining is not profitable for anyone.

It only takes such a long time if no vulnerabilities have found in the process. Almost all cryptographic vulnerabilities just lower the amount of brute forcing needed to find a key. So lets say for a particular scheme it would take 2^192 calculations to find a key, if you lower that to 2^96 you're talking going from a time scale like 'heat death of the universe' to can be done by a bunch asics in a day.

@_date: 2013-09-06 18:41:26
TLDR: Its very possible on a technical level and there are reasons why the US would want to do something like this and I've been thinking about bitcoin too much. 
No it's not taking it too far at all. How could the nsa track the vast majority of transactions? Theres probably a couple ways, but the one that springs to mind are setup a suitable number of 'watcher' nodes. Watcher node would act like normal nodes but that would also connect to a large number of nodes and keep track of where they hear about transactions first. A large number of nodes spread out geographical well could easily 'triangulate' the nodes that originated a particular transaction. Realisiticly the NSA could get servers placed whereever they want around the world, either covertly or with explicit permission of the local governments. The places the NSA couldn't get nodes placed aren't places that have alot or any bitcoin activity anyways eg North Korea, Iran, etc.
Would they have to have alot of these nodes? It's going to depend on the number of node so lets say there are 100,000 nodes world wide, probably fairly realistic. Well I'd say you'd need atleast 1/8 of the nodes out there to be 'watchers' or watched, why? the average bitcoin client connects to 8 other nodes when submitting transaction. So the a client will on average connect to one watcher node thus a client submitting a transaction will be easily identified. It's trivial for the  NSA can get 12,500 nodes spread out across the globe. 
It's not about the US subverting its own currency. The most tinfoil hat explanation is that Bitcoin is *the replacement* for the dollar, dollar 2.0. It might subvert the dollar but if the NSA is satoshi and satoshi owns 1+ million of the bitcoins out there then the US government will be doing much better than it is now in terms of wealth. In fact, its a relatively elegant solution to the massive debt problem of the US, create alternative currency which you own a massive percentage of, inflate the dollar ad nauseam to wipe out the national debt and then you have control of a truly world currency and one that you can track. 
Now, do i buy that bitcoin is actually a secret plan by the US government to create a replacement that could destroy the existing dollar and wipe out all US national debt? no, it would be the most elaborate false flag operation in the history of human kind and a economic coup that would cause chaos imo.

You haven't seen what "threatened by the US government" feels like. If the US government was threatened then I think we would all be a bit scared. Should the US government feel threatened by bitcoin? no! Bitcoin has a market cap of what? 1.7 billion USD. While impressive for a startup currency, thats a drop in the bucket in global finance. 
Go look at a stock screener and search for companies with a capitalization under 2 billion and see what percentage you've heard of. Chances are only a handful. Just like these large but relatively unheard of companies Bitcoin just isn't that big yet. 
When bitcoin's market cap is 170 billion ($10,000+/BTC), then the US can start worrying.

This is kind of the million dollar question with bitcoin. The traditional economic view (keynesian) is that you wouldn't want to use a currency with such a tight money supply because people will not want to spend it as casually as they do fiat because they're so concerned with how they could earn their next bitcoins since they're so hard to come by.
Most bitcoiners don't think keynesian economics is right and adhere to austrian economic theory which states that gold/silver/bitcoins are the right form of money because such a tight money supply doesn't encourage booms and busts in the way the keynesian economics does. E.g. we wouldn't have had a housing bubble and bust because people couldn't have gotten cheap loans easily to finance all the excess building.
Who's right? I don't know, but bitcoin is a fascinating experiment in economics. Regardless of how it ends up it will be discussed in economic circles for a long time, whether as an austrian victory or keynesian one.

The same way they auction off other seized goods. For example the IRS auctions off good seized due to tax judgements and you can look at the stuff on their [site]( You show up and bid and if you win you pay. Sometimes auctions require you to deposit money ahead of time to ensure you're a serious bidder so they'll probably require that you do. Bitcoins obviously a little different than a car so rather than getting title to the bitcoins you get the private keys or perhaps they'll just open up a client, import the private keys and then send you the bitcoins.

I'm going to play to voice of reason. It's an incredibly speculative play. Let me list the ways it could go wrong:
1. You could get screwed by whatever exchange you use. Eg it get shut down the next day, doesn't deliver (e.g. bit instant), or otherwise screws you. 
2. You do a poor job of securing your wallet or exchange account and suddenly all your coins are gone to a clever thief in the night. 
3. The exchange rate tumbles. It's always a possibility, anyone that tells you otherwise is an idiot. Now your money is worth a whole lot less and you won't ever be able to discharge it in bankruptcy. 
4. Something else happens that I can't imagine at the moment.

That value should be from 0.1 to 0.01. 0.1 indicates a 10 fold increase in a year and 0.01 indicates a 100 fold increase in a year. Well guess what difficulty was one year ago? 3 million and its now above 300 million so for the last year the network has increased by a 100 fold/year rate (e.g. 0.01 for decline per year). Do the calculations again with any number between 0.1 and 0.01 and you'll see why you've gotten so many down votes.

Its not inaccurate to think that a deflationary currency is a poor choice to get long term loans with from the perspective of the borrower. Its why you don't see large amounts of loans being given in bitcoin. That being said, I don't think bitcoin was designed to be some global currency that everyone should use all the time for everything. It shines in areas where traditional currencies suck, like international trade, as hedge against inflation, relatively private transacting, etc. As such bitcoin is better considered as a complementary currency not some pancea for a one world global currency. 
Honestly I'm surprised not ones come up with a fedcoin. A coin where the distribution schedule can be changed by a central authority. It would conform to the majorities expectation of central bank type intervention. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:04:03
The tough part is coming. Mining is becoming a private enterprise rather than something individuals can engage in. Once open distribution of coins is completely ended the community will be hurt since supply of coins will effectively become the power of a few megaminers like avalon. Little mini central banks or an OPEC like cartel.
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:03:04
Strictly speaking, nothing. We're seen it happen before, back around the middle of 2011, there had been an increase in network speed because of the run up to the first bitcoin bubble . After the price came crashing down the speed dropped for bit. Basically all these people saw the returns on gpu's and fpga's and the high price and bought equipment. After the price no longer support mining they took it off the network until things calmed down and everyone realized it wasn't the end of the world. The difficulty only came down enough to justify near break even mining for gpu's. I remember because I took my GPU's offline because I lived in an area with expensive electricity and had to do the math to find out. 
That's what will happen this time, one way or another. Either the network difficulty will keep going up at a blistering speed and start affecting ASIC viability or there may be a 'shock' type event. Either way this kind of growth can't keep going on for a whole lot longer (&gt;6 months).

Theres also the issue of dimishing returns upon appreciation of bitcoins. Let say bitcoins value doubles to ~$30/usd, this will undoubtedly lead to lower bet volumes in bitcoins but the same or higher amount in dollars. So the returns will be significantly diminished on the bitcoin dividend side but theres also the problem of lowered stock values because shareholders will be incentivized to sell their now doubled (in dollar) stocks for some quick dollars.  
This problem applies to all stocks valued in bitcoins that make their profit in bitcoins since you get a double whammy in stock depreciation as well as yield as bit coins appreciate. 
TLDR: In the short term make hay while the sun shines.
@_date: 2013-09-30 16:28:53
Surprises? Process size can't get much smaller than 28nm, maybe 20nm. but 14nm is way too difficult and expensive for anyone but intel to get into. Going from 28 to 20 will not provide the kind of efficiency increase that going from gpus to 110nm asics did. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:31:08
Quicker confirmations is about convenience not security, that should be obvious. As far a security goes, take off your tin foil hat, no ones pulled off a successful attack against either bitcoin or litecoin and probably never will and thats good enough. 
More individual miners is a good thing, it seeds the currency out to more people. If bitcoin had launched with ASICs it wouldn't have taken off. Seeding little bits of the money around to many people is a HUGE plus. It boot straps adoption. 
If anything bitcoin will become the myspace of cryptocurrencies. 
It's ironic you're being so narrow minded considering many people outside the bitcoin bubble would consider bitcoin miners to "seem to be productive at the expense of the rubes who buy it".
I own both bitcoin and litecoin and mine both and its silly to think that the bitcoin *must* be the apex of human ingenuity.

Sort of. Bitcoin is able to function without any fiat exchange mechanism just fine. However setting prices for products becomes tricky without a reliable gauge such as a fiat market.

Bit instant actually makes VERY large daily purchases and they can easily move the exchange with their purchases or lack of purchases.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:01:37
No, the simplest way would be that you deposit bitcoin with the card company, they give you a visa/mastercard debit card. When you make a purchase, the card company sells the bitcoins that you've already deposited and authorizes the charge (assuming you have enough bitcoin). The card company makes money off the visa/mastercard merchant fees and maybe a small percentage from the sale of the bitcoins. 
Atleast thats what I told the VC. In reality this isn't gonna happen anytime soon. The regulatory environment is too hostile and burdensome to something like this. Basically you'd have to get a bank charter and maybe even some SEC approval. There is a ton of demand for something like this, but lots of people have tried and failed or it becomes too expensive since some many third parties have to be involved. 
@_date: 2013-09-15 21:39:25
Well it depends on what you mean by stability? The network doesn't have to keep growing for bitcoin to be functional. 
As far as technological 'walls' go I'll try to draw a scenario of what I think you mean. Lets say because of some physical laws the smallest process size that can be made is 7nm so the fastest asics will be on 7nm and the network will lets level out at lets say 10 exahash. Well thats what it will level out at, all miners who have cheap electricity will make a small profit and the overall network will not keep growing. Bitcoins will still be transacted and people will be able to use it for what they use it for now.
The lack of small time mining only really hurts adoption of bitcoin by the public. I doubt I would have ever gotten involved with bitcoin if there wasn't a way for me to get some for "free".

What became of standard oil? got split into to 34 companies and today they've basically remerged into BP, ExxonMobil, and Chevron. What happened to Ma Bell, it got split into 7 baby bells, and surprise, they've remerged into at&amp;t and verizon. Corporations act like the borg, they naturally assimilate. Eventually there will be two companies in the world, target-att-exxon-cvs-mcdonalds-google and wal-martgreens-bp-verizon-burger-appleking.

There aren't any obvious backdoors. The control comes partly from the fact that the NSA can trace all transactions since they already have such broad surveillance capabilities. Having broken EC encryption is another possibility that could give them control if they want to use it, presumably on an individual basis. If they did break EC I'm sure they would only use in a selective manner, seize specific individuals bitcoins, they might chalk it up to a hack or something, etc.

Scripting is also not allowed by reddit so the only way we could do something like a 'ticker' would link to an image that gets updated constantly. But you provide a good reason not to do that.

It's falling because the winklevoss have stopped supporting the market. They've bought all the coins they need for their fund but coins are still being minted at 3600+ a day so unless those new coins are being hoarded or not exchanged otherwise, the price will fall.

Some pools, in particular, Eligius, view gambling as either a liability (processing transactions for gambling sites is technically illegal in the US whether in bitcoin or fiat) or as a negative for the network. Also miners rely on the block reward rather than on the mining fees for make their money. The fee's per block only amount to about ~0.2BTC on average or less than 1% of the block reward of 25BTC. So minera are only kept in business by inflation/subsidy.

Litecoin has quicker confirmations and arguably a more distributed and certainly more accessible mining system. I don't see why people are so quick to shun litecoin having accepted the premise of bitcoin. Who's to say bitcoin got it 100% right?

Around the time you say fuck this shit.

The price is being pushed up by a cabal of asic miners. Bitcoin mining has become effectively monopolized by those who have gotten their avalon asic's. This handful of people are not interested in putting bitcoin into the hands of more people but rather driving up price but hoarding and perhaps buying. Eventually one of these people that have racked up thousands of bitcoin will flinch and sell their hoard at some high price like 100 - 150 and bring the price back down, as the price peaks, fear might set in among others in the group and they try to cash in, those that bought at high prices might panic and ultimately cause some extreme volatility. 
This isn't to criticize those with their asic's because if I was them I'd be doing the same thing.

BFL will have some serious competition in the ASIC field from others real soon. Besides KNCMiner, I know of one unannounced project to develop asics with VC money and they have experienced competent individuals working on it. Also not having to basically run a kickstarter to get funding is a huge plus.

No, you can't donate it to a person because donations can only be given to 501c corporations (registered charities). By giving it to a person it would count as a gift and if the gift is assessed at more than $14,000 the gift giver will have to pay a gift tax on the amount over $14,000.

Its gonna be the biggest jump in nominal difficulty.
@_date: 2013-09-15 13:58:01
I think your assumption that the difficulty will keep increasing by 30% each retarget isn't feasible for such a long time. Why? FPGAs start to become unprofitable around 300 million so anyone running those will drop out soon.  At a difficulty of around 5 billion even the ASIC's start to lose money (assuming a price of $120 and $0.10/kwhr). So i'd say we start to see a plateau of network increase around 3 billion which could come as soon as february.

Well think about it like this, a general purpose CPU (eg your intel icore's) is capable of doing every kind of calculation but because it is so broadly capable it is relatively slow. These ASIC's are only capable of doing bitcoin calculations and because they only use their silicon for one purpose they do it quickly and power efficiently.

No. At that point the government can start turning the screws to people and businesses. Shuttering big exchanges, sending in undercovers to localbitcoins, seizing any bank account that has the slightness wiff of bitcoin related activity, etc. if all the tools of the war on drugs/terrorism were given to a war on bitcoin we'd all be fucked and you'd know it. 
Would bitcoin survive? sure, but that $10,000 exchange rate would drop REAL quick.

uBTC is nice because you still maintain 2 decimal places so people in the eurozone and US and commonwealth countries that are used to seeing prices in the xx.xx format (e.g. $52.70) feel comfortable.

I love bitcoin as much as anyone here but we are by no means in the "dark age of inflation". Some people need a history lesson, the dark ages of inflation were in the 1970's and 1980's and probably 2020's but to act as if we're in some inflationary hell right now is just plain silly.

The members do work on a coordinated basis. They get their work from the same pool and if the pool operator is evil he could be messing with the work to 'confirm' fraudulent transactions
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:02:12
21 million is essentially an arbitrary number, it could have just as easily be 10 million or 100 million. It's fixed because you don't want people to easily have the ability to devalue your currency at will by creating more out of thin air. 
The choice to decrease the rate of release was design to encourage people to mine at the beginning rather than the end. If you had a currency that increases the rate of release then miners would wait until the rewards got higher to miner rather than mine when the coin is first released. 
Bitcoin go the incentives right at least at it's startup phase because it encourages quick adoption by rewarding early adopters but I feel that it can lead to some perverse consequences by encouraging a mining arms race rather than adoption through commerce by more people. Personally I would have extended the period of high rewards because it helps subsidize commerce by spreading out the wealth more so. 
@_date: 2013-09-07 07:00:57
It means you're gonna see difficulty at 100+ million on the next retarget.

Well strictly speaking the shutdown and the debt limit are two different issues. Each could be resolved separately. If the US does default (extraordinarily unlikely IMHO), the primary benefactors would be the traditional safe havens like gold, silver, swiss franc, yen, etc. Mostly because its still pretty hard to get a lot of money into bitcoin quickly and because bitcoin doesn't always act like a safe haven instrument.
Also since bitcoin is likely a better hedge against inflation than anything else a debt default might hurt bitcoin prices since people see the US no longer inflating the dollar so less need to hedge against inflation.
