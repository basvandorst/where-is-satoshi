Nah we getting shafted, its at .30 now

By "wrapped up" you mean with trading starts? or the exchange tab will be accessible before that?
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:08:45
I honestly don't know if he was partying because he just fleeced customers off $70 million or because finex is truly fucked and he knows he's on a sinking ship and there are no lifeboats left

Well that's it, as pretty much everyone here who had fiat and or alt I will take my money dump the bfx and never return to this exchange
When you store btc in an exchange you are playing with fire, so don't cry if you get burn. But if you store fiat you should be safe, because it's in a bank.
Of course fiat wont go suddenly up in price and give you a nice profit but that's the sacrifice you make for security. So why should the users who had fiat had to compensate the ones that were constantly speculating with btc?
Seriously, this is ridiculous

I would do the same mind you, but thats not the way the world works and most of the time the only way to find a thief is with another thief who would rather backstab you and join that thief

Zane as I write this is 9AM in HK, will trading start today or is going to be another day? just want to know
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:45:57


It could but I doubt they will, someone else's loss is someone else's profit

"Some guys say" - what can't you read?
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:57:10
Some guys say the trading already started but only whales get a pass
In which case regular users might get even more bfx 
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:10:32
Another question Zane, will withdrawals of BTC and other coins be immediate or will they have to be cleared manually by employees? I'm asking because you said all coins are now in cold wallets
Also I can't access the exchange section anymore, I know nobody can place any orders until trading starts but we were able to go there anyway and now I can't, whats going on?
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:26:26
Rumor says if price goes up ppl plan to take advantage and pump btc at higher prices
@_date: 2016-08-09 20:58:34


Goes straight to the margin funding tab, can't select the other 2 tabs at all


What you mean with that? what kind of users are those?
@_date: 2016-08-10 00:41:34
Will we get an email or something?
@_date: 2016-08-10 00:39:59
Is there an ETA for that? 24 hours? 48?
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:06:21
BFX is now 80 cents, we are already getting screwed before trading even begun
@_date: 2016-08-10 14:13:11
Why is the exchange tab still inaccessible? 
@_date: 2016-08-11 12:06:35
Was going to say the same, why rat out the hacker when you can blackmail them for easily double the reward?
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:12:56
So this affects users with btc or are etc and usd assets also getting this cut?
@_date: 2016-08-05 08:11:47
Is that the whalegroup link?
