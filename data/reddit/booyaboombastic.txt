The only reason Netflix doesn't do PPV or other models (e.g., their current model with multiple tiers) is because they're in expansion mode and want to keep their offering as simple and straightforward as possible. You look at Vudu, Amazon Instant Video and others with multiple options and their websites and apps quickly get pretty complicated and tough to follow. With Netflix it's very simple--you see what movies are available, you click the one you want, and you watch it without extra charges. Offering a PPV option that requires bitcoin would be incredibly complicated for the average Netflix user and would go against their whole idea of keeping it simple. Not to be Debbie Downer, but if Netflix were to accept Bitcoin (which is of course a big if), it would almost certainly do it as an alternative means of paying for its existing offering without whole lot of promotion/advertising around it.

Hey thanks a lot!  Much appreciated. =)

So *restaurants in general* can increase their margin with bitcoin, and *this particular restaurant* is giving a discount for those who pay with bitcoin--where is the problem?

Do you accept PayPal??

"arbitration clause" doesn't mean he won't get anything; if he did agree to one, it would just mean that he would have to go to a mediator/arbitrator rather than a normal judge/court

This guy's base case isn't that big of a deal, and the idea that PayPal is going to go down or lose the ability to accept credit cards because they kept his $30k is laughable. BUT, that phone conversation sounds dangerously close to anti-competitive behavior, and if PayPal got slapped with an anti-trust suit they could have all sorts of major ramifications here.

Don't think this makes it any less valid, though. Big money coming in is a good sign.

Thank you so much for doing this! This answered so many questions I had in a very straightforward manner. Getting plain answers like this out there and accessible to all is critical for increasing bitcoin use/adoption on a wider scale.
