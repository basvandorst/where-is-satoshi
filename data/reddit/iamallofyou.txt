Unless you are using a VPN or TOR, I imagine most porn sites are tracking what you are watching anyway.   It says that MU 2.0 is supposed to be completely anonymous somehow.

It depends on what it is, but for something I really wanted, I'd pay up to 50 cents for a high quality download.

which work equally well  as this method,  except they cost money.

In order to see how this model successfully works, all you have to do is look at the darknet markets.

Just leave a small amount (&lt;1000 USD worth) in your coinbase account. Whenever you make a purchase, just buy the amount back immediately so you always have that amount in your coinbase wallet. Anything over that, store in your paper wallet.

I think it probably has more to do with the uploader getting paid as well, thus providing incentive for lots of content to be uploaded there.

Some people would panic sell, some would hold, and others would buy at the cheaper prices .

Don't you think it would be hard to get all of those players to agree to do this? What would ensure that one wouldn't start selling early to maximize their profits?

But wouldn't all the whales and Satoshi need to collaborate together to kill bitcoin?  Since bitcoin is anonymous, do any of the whales even know each other?

If Roger Ver sold all his bitcoins, would it kill bitcoin? I think its more likely that the price would experience a significant drop, others would buy those coins, and bitcoin would be further divested. Eventually the price would get back to where it was previously.

As long as you have a good bank that doesnt charge you foreign conversion fees, ATMs by far offer the best rates overseas.

Do you realize that less than a half a percent of Bitcoins are used for drug transactions, AND that 90% of all US Bills contain traces of cocaine? So whatever perception that you have of Bitcoin is false. Bitcoin's trace ability on the Blockchain make it less suited for nefarious activities than using cash. 


If a bank or government decides to freezes your account for whatever reason, there is very little one could to in order to get their money back.


This is very simplistic. People are becoming increasingly dissatisifed with this type of lifestyle and want something more. Why do you think Trump got elected? That is just a hint of the discontent that is brewing amongst the population and it does not seem to be getting any better.


It hasn't even begun to be adopted in any substantial amount yet. It has a lot further to go.  You are saying the same arguments that have for years and yet bitcoin keeps rising.

There are people who are value investing and making intelligent decisions with their investments,... But a lot of that $22 trillion is 401k money, invested by employees and employer matching contribution. They lure people in with assumed returns of 7-10% per year, every year, and who knows how well that money will be invested by the fund managers. 
Combine all of  that with market manipulation and the shady things which led to the 2008 financial crisis and the fact we are in an everything bubble (stock, student, government,  consumer debt), one could say that a big portion of that $22 triillion is stupid money.

I think the government in China (and in many other places) kind of gets in the way for wide scale adoption. I have heard that there are Bitcoin ATMs everywhere in Taiwan however.

It isn't that much harder than maintaing an online banking account and keeping the login credentials secure. There will be further innovations with regards of secure, easy to use wallets.


Doesn't it? Banks will not be able to create bitcoins out of thin air like they currently do. You are right they might be able to offer "bitcoin credits", but if you hold your own bitcoin, then you will be fine. At least with Bitcoin, we are in cotnrol with what happens to our own bitcoins and it can't be debased by a central bank.
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:13:12
Because bitcoin is a threat to central banking,  is it not?

After the nuclear bomb was invented, there has not been a major worldwide conflict since. Is that a coincidence then?  
I also don't think they are as enlightened as you think. The military industrial complex is very powerful, and many US politicians are in bed with it. Given the rhetoric on Russia, it is clear they would love to start a war. But I'd wager it is the threat of nuclear war holding them back rather than enlightened thinking on their part. 
I would also argue that given things like the Patriot Act, and war on drugs, western countries are becoming more authoritarian and less democratic.

In my opinion, this kind of thinking really prevents true societal progress from being made. Yes, life is generally more comfortable in 2017 than it was in the middle ages, and we should be thankful for that. However it does not mean we cannot continue to make improvements. 
Central banking and wars still remain a huge problem, and to ignore that makes no sense.  
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:51:17


If nobody uses dollars anymore, (cash or digital) , what role would the central banks have? 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:20:17


If they are no longer needed, why would we need them anymore? 


Again, this is no different than them demanding your ATM card and PIN number.  But you also you also wouldn't store all of your bitcoins on one wallet, and you wouldn't store the private keys all in one place. 


On the blockchain obviously. You wouldn't have this option if they stole cash.  
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:05:58
I'd say it would be more accurate to say that those ancient wars were funded via a "rape-and-plunder" standard rather than a central bank gold standard so they aren't really comparable with modern warfare.
 
I also wouldn't equate  central banks with keeeping the peace via "codified economic theories". Wouldn't it have more to do with the invention of nuclear weapons?
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:29:57


Private companies. Why would you need a central bank? If it is profitable, there will be many suppliers to meet the demand...economics 101. 


Are you familiar at all with Bitcoin? There are many ways to keep them safe. Your example also would be no different than thieves coming to grandma's and demanding her ATM card and pin number, holding her hostage for a few days until they drain grandma's bank account.   But if Grandma secured her Bitcoin properly, that wouldn't be an issue. You would also be able to track the bitcoins better rather than you could with stolen cash.

I think what you are referring to is the old "shoeshine boy giving stock tips" anecdote. However I'm not remotely convinced that we are at this level yet. I would say that about 10% of everyone I know has even heard of Bitcoin. 
Also, who is this guy? Since he is on the front page, I am assuming he is someone fairly well known in the financial industry..not exactly a shoeshine boy equivalent.

Unlike tulips, bitcoin has a limited supply. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:38:42
Why couldn't  Bitcoin eventually replace central banking? If everyone used Bitcoin, what would we need central banks for? 
But regarding your comments of peace and prosperity, I would agree to an extent, but many argue that the move from the gold standard to fiat allows governments to run up massive debts, which will eventually lead to large scale destabilization. From what I can tell, that appears to be happening worldwide.So central banking might have had its usefulness in the past, but their usefulness has run out, and their continued intervention appears to be overall more destructive.

You clearly should do more research on Bitcoin. You can see where the coins get transferred to on the blockchain. If they get spent somewhere, you could potentially figure out who owns that wallet and investigate from there. The government also has several projects that are working to de-anonymize the blockchain. They might be able to use bitcoin tumblers, but thats not perfect either.  Still better transparency than cash.


Many people have their checking accounts backed up by their savings accounts as a form of overdraft protection. 


Not if they wore a mask.


Too dangerous. Besides many theives will walk thier victim to the machine and have them draw it out for them.


Not easily.


In Latin America it is common practice to kidnap your victim and drain their bank account each day until it is gone. It happens in the US as well. 


ATM's do not 'mark' the cash. Nor do they keep track of the serial numbers of the bills.


You can also purchase Bitcoin insurance.
