The truth is that I have make lots of money betting for its fall. I think there is still a long way down. I just want to profit from it, I don't care if it goes down or up and if it disappears I will look for another profitable investment.

around 5000 new wallets every day no matter what...
this is a blockchain bot, no real user data given
Coinbase was asked about the real users once and no answer was given, Circle doesn't give any data, either Xapo...
These are all fake statistics

so, how many "retirement plans" do you think got into the game today?

Looking at coinbase's volume allowing clients from 25 states, I woldn't expect much from itbit.
When people realize that having legal exchanges / funds to invest is not enough to increase adoption the crash could be epic.
No matter how easy is to get into bitcoins, general interest still quite low...

Most of us are speculators, it is a very profitable asset, I made lots of $ just shorting hard. Although holders and believers are still very useful to sustain rises and dumps. Thank you holder!!! :D :D :D

Not at all, no matter how you look at it, around 600 BTC volume so far during the first 3 hours of a much hyped new ETN at Swedish Nasdaq is a joke.
This low (around 141.000 $ ) volume shows a real lack of interest among investors.

The profit I have already make will last me forever. :)

I only use bitcoin for speculation, opening short positions since ~615$ / BTC.

I have make 240 btc just shorting since the price was 617$ at finex, I would love to also take the one btc you have left. CHEERS. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 15:05:28
and by $ volume? have you bother to calculate... oh... what a surprise...

Lets wait then and long squeeze it until it can grow again in a couple of years. It is been a exiting and profitable ride so far!

Remember that you can make the same amount of money if things go wrong with bitcoin, I am shorting it hard since the ~600$ and have make lots of money with it.
Do not wait for the "bubble" if you can make lots of money just by the collapse of it.
