“To provide additional predictability to the XRP supply, Ripple has locked 55 billion XRP (55% of the total possible supply) into a series of escrows.” This occurred recently and each month 1 billion will be released into supply. Leftover XRP goes into a new escrow account.

My understanding is that the majority of the people in r/BTC wanted bigger blocks over small blocks. After segwit, bigger blocks were planned with segwit2x. Then came the NO2X movement for BTC. Then came the contentious hard fork because a lot of people wanted bigger blocks. So, it is only natural that r/BTC would favor BCH due to the bigger blocks.

It does blur the lines. To make this more interesting, there are a lot of similarities between the minds of CEOs and sociopaths. It is very easy for CEOs to justify their actions as a simple means to an end that they think everyone needs (whether the people have realized it yet or not). 
Marketing is one of the most slippery slopes because it is also a competitive strategy, and the competition is not always playing fair. So, where do you draw the line? Ver calling Bitcoin Cash “the real Bitcoin” doesn’t pass the ethical litmus test, but I do think he believes what he is doing is in the best interest of saving Bitcoin. Sure, he’s going to make money at the same time, but he’s not in it to destroy Bitcoin. He loves Bitcoin.

Exactly my question. A core purpose of bitcoin is to prevent fraud and corruption. For this reason, it is a public ledger (i.e. not private).  
This meme is misleading. BTC is not about privacy.

Even though I believe in and support electric cars, it is not obvious they will ever replace gas vehicles. See “who killed the electric car”... and capitalism. The baby boomer generation is still alive and selling their philosophy. Another 50-150 years... maybe electric cars will be affordable to everyone. Until then, no sir, no chance. 
What is bitcoin’s utility right now? 
Bitcoin is not cleaner than any crypto or fiat; it is actually quite dirty in terms of energy consumption. 
Bitcoin Faster? Than what? Gold is not fast, and bitcoin transactions are slower than that of most crypto currencies. 
It is **NOT** obvious that bitcoin will replace gold and fiat. Bitcoin faltered as a currency and was labeled a store of value (see scaling problems in 2017); these issues have yet to be resolved in practice. 
Bitcoin is NOT a precious metal that people like to make jewelry out of, and I see no comparable utility in Bitcoin at this time. In addition to having real utility, Gold is more immutable than bitcoin. So, no, nowhere close to “all parameters”. 
People used to care about use cases instead of obfuscating them. Get back to use cases and utility, and then we can talk about this again.

Calabash, NC is about 30 minutes from Myrtle Beach, and it’s a really small town well known for its seafood. Calabash-style seafood means seasoned, lightly breaded and fried, just like most things in the south.

This is par for the course for US government. Slowing things down is part of the job description.
