Awesome work guys. (At least, I think it is awesome... I can't fully grok it!)
@_date: 2016-04-16 06:25:17
A pretty fair article, I think. I like the last sentence:
We should be attentive to the potential benefits of these new technologies, and prepared to make the necessary regulatory adjustments if their safety and integrity is proven and their potential benefits found to be in the public interest.

Unless I misunderstand that graph, aren't those highlighted areas just transactions appearing at one fee level? For instance the first black rectangle shows a bunch of new purple (50-60 sat/byte) transactions. The height of the other higher fee levels just move up due to the graphing summation technique.

I think that your 'Estimated hashrate' number is perhaps just a tiny, teensy, eensy bit more precise than the facts allow.
@_date: 2014-04-16 22:08:17
I'm glad that we managed to get your coins back for you :)
I would agree with OP - the BitGo wallet is clean, secure, and the mandatory use of 2 of 3 signatures and 2FA makes it probably the safest online wallet around. I recommend it.

Duh. Stupid. The main reason given by the Australian Tax Office for bitcoin not being 'money' or 'currency' is:
"" It is the legislative recognition of something as a monetary unit of exchange which makes that thing 'currency'. That 'currency' can only exist within a legal framework and as an exercise of sovereignty is an aspect of the State theory of money - insofar as it is only by 'fiat' of the State that legitimacy is conferred""
This is so dumb. 
A currency like the zimbabwean dollar in 2008 (when it reached a peak inflation rate of 70 billion percent (that is not a typo!)) would be fine, because it was legislated 'currency'.
A currency like the Mexican peso in 1993 (when it was revalued at 0.1% of the original) would be fine, because it was legislated 'currency'.
But bitcoin, being mathematically defined and not legislated by a bunch of imbeciles in some foreign country... cannot be a currency.

I seldom bother commenting on reddit posts. But this time... I just can't stop myself. Awesome news. Now that the cat (and maybe doge) is out of the bag, every other auction site will be scrambling to play in the bitcoin space too. (by 'space', I do mean moon, uranus, alpha centauri etc...). 
Mass adoption looms. Ubiquity approaches. Universality transcends. Interoperability enables.

Thanks for the review smilingloki12. I thank you too, for your honesty in paying the success fee. FWIW, I think that BitGo seems like a very good product - their 2 of 3 wallet is a decent improvement on the other web/hybrid wallets.  Cheers Dave

Hi. If you look further down this thread, you will see the comment by Mandrik0, who really is 'the man' Mandrik from blockchain.info. He has corroborated that OP really did lose his password. Mandrik didn't mention it specifically, but rest assured that I (Dave Bitcoin, from walletrecoveryservices) did indeed help OP recover his bitcoins. (and that the other references and links that you provide are actual real reviews).

Hi IGETSHIVERSWHENIP.
Glad to have been able to help. 
Thanks for the review and feedback - I totally understand that our website is cr*p. Its on my (long) list of things to fix up!
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:02:10
Hi. Dave Bitcoin here.
I don't generally comment on these threads where the discussion revolves around 'give me some proof that you are trustworthy'. It isn't really possible for me to prove anything to a skeptic's satisfaction. That is fine. Distrust (especially when easily stolen bitcoins are at stake) is understandable.
I will point out a couple of things, though:
The first point is that there is a very good reason why many of the people reviewing walletrecoveryservices.com are first-time posters on reddit. Why? Because I ask them to! When a client comes to me (often anonymously), and I help him with recovering his wallet, then I ask him to post a review online and I mention reddit.comMany bitcoin users (over 1M just at blockchain.info) have not got a reddit account that they want to use, so they just create a new one. If you can think of a better way of soliciting reliable feedback, I'm open to suggestions...
My second point is that I'm doing this wallet recovery as a sustainable business. I've been doing it for coming up on a year. I do not make enough money to give up my 'day job' (as a software engineer), but I gather a few bitcoins from my 'success fee'. I'm fully aware that if I stole someone's wallet, then my reputation would suffer. 
I have some awesome software now - I now use multiple GPUs for high speed decryption.... (more on this on my website in a few weeks time)
I work on large (rich) wallets, and I work on small (poor) wallets. Its fun. 
Dave Bitcoin

Although not all  Andreas's arguments makes sense... you can't argue that for someone to spend a billion just to disrupt bitcoin (for no real benefit) would be fantastically improbable.

I suggest that you first use some well recognized disk recovery software to scan the disk for a deleted wallet.dat file. If you can recover this file, then you are sweet!. If you fail, then yes, I do have software that can scan hard disks raw sectors, searching for private keys from bitcoin wallets. Cheers Dave (
@_date: 2015-08-11 09:04:21
Thanks for the plug, /user/DaRaminder :)
I was watching this thread. I suspect that OP has gotten his wallets mixed up somehow. If the recorded password doesn't work, and the restored-from-seed wallet addresses are different, then that suggests to me that the recorded information (password and seed) are not correct for that wallet. OP, you may contact me if you want me to attempt to assist you.
Cheers Dave
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:44:59
Yes, certainly we handle BIP39 passphrases, given the mnemonic words. But, as you probably realize, cracking this type of wallet is pretty slow work. More than a handful of unknown characters will be hard work for BIP39. In the end it comes down to math - how many combinations are required to be tested and the speed/cost of cracking and the chance of success and the expected reward. Our software is designed to be highly scalable, so for large wallets, we can horizontally scale the effort as required.

Hi OP. Thanks for the review. I very much appreciate it when a client posts a review. Only a small fraction of people who I help via walletrecoveryservices end up posting a testimonial - for various reasons, but mainly because they are either wanting to remain anonymous, or they simply have no account on reddit. (and often when a newbie user posts a review, the moderators have deleted it - presumably falsely assuming it to be a sock-puppet account).

@_date: 2016-02-21 02:20:03
Hi All.
Ok, here is the actual situation, with regards to the 100 BTC in question:
This wallet first surfaced in June 2014. Refer to the thread at
The wallet was actually stolen from an FTP site, and belongs to a respected user on bitcointalk.org,  
This wallet has been floating around the internet since then, but it has a strong password, and has never been cracked.
Over the years, I have been sent this wallet several times, by different people. (and when it was first sent to me, I didn't realize it was stolen, and I tried to crack it, but without success.)
Anyway, a few days ago, this new guy, 'User Good', sent me the wallet. Not knowing the details of the wallet, I agreed to my standard contract of a 20% success fee. However once he sent me the wallet, I realized that this was the stolen wallet from 2 years ago.
At this point, I sent an email to the actual owner, informing him that this wallet was floating around with a bunch of hackers. He then moved the coins from that compromised wallet to somewhere else. I informed 'User Good' about exactly what had occurred.
That would normally be the end of the (happy) story, however now 'User Good' is badgering me for the return of 'his' 100 BTC. He even admits that the wallet was sent to him from someone else, and he has no idea of the password. He threatened to vilify me on the forums unless I sent him some bitcoins. I informed the actual owner (Technologov) about this, and he kindly clarified the situation - see the last posting in the thread at 
All the information above is verifiable, and I have email conversations to prove it, including my correspondence with the rightful owner.

@_date: 2019-09-02 01:09:54
Thanks MarcBago for alerting me to this challenge. I have only briefly examined the problem, but it does look to be a fairly hard problem to solve. If the base and exponent are large (eg 7+), then it would certainly be too costly (slow) to crack. But perhaps the base and exponent are small, and then it is quite feasible... I have no doubt someone will give it a go, but I'm pretty busy with other work right now, so it won't be me. I'm also interested in the answer to the observation above by Shancer\_, which throws some doubt on the veracity of the supposed prize.

Hi. I would love to help... but this sounds like a hardware problem... 
and obtaining the wallet.dat file is a necessary first step...
@_date: 2015-03-09 07:14:40
I generally just ignore them. Who knows where the dodgy wallets come from, or which jurisdiction to report them to? But in this case, since there was quite a lot of bitcoins in the wallet, I thought it best to seek some advice :)
@_date: 2015-03-09 09:37:34
Hi. Yes, I've performed several wallet recoveries from disk images and/or corrupted file systems. However... if the entire disk is encrypted, then probably not very likely! (unless you know the encryption key). Email me if you want to discuss.
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:57:09
One of the main indicators is when the user has no idea of what the password might be. In this situation (as with the 100 btc wallet we are dealing with here), then it is generally impossible to decrypt the wallet anyway. (assuming a 'strong' password has been used in the first place)
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:19:19
Thanks guys. That is fantastic. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 08:09:54
Well, no, I won't be 'outing' the dodgy characters who sent this wallet to me. They have all come from 'one-time' email addresses, and (more importantly) I have to maintain a high level of privacy for anyone that contacts me. If I had actual proof of a misdemeanor or theft then maybe things would be different, but my main motivation at this point is simply to warn the rightful owner of the wallet that his security has been compromised.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:51:13
No, unfortunately I still have a day job (as a software tech geek). I make a few bitcoins income every now and again from walletrecoveryservices.com, but certainly not enough to live on.

I offer a recovery service to people who forget their bitcoin wallet passwords. Normally these wallets are clearly owned by the person contacting me.... but sometimes they are not!
This particular multibit wallet has been sent to me by 3 different people over the last month - all purporting to be the rightful owner of this wallet and to have forgotten their password. Clearly none of them are legit, since they have no idea of what the password is/was/could be. (and since spending transactions are continuing on the wallet)
The wallet is fairly 'rich', holding over 100 btc.
If this is your wallet, please contact me and let me know. It has clearly been stolen from you. I have given  a perfunctory attempt at cracking it, and failed, so I think you probably have a fairly secure password and needn't be overly concerned that your bitcoins are about to disappear.
(If I can't crack it, then most likely no-one can :) )

It depends somewhat on the choice of wallet software... 10 random characters would be very strong for a BIP38 password, but not very strong for some other wallet formats.

I have messaged you.

I appreciate that a heap of 0 history posts can look dodgy, but the fact is that most often my clients are rather protective of their identities. I dare say that sometimes they (not me) do create 'temporary' reddit accounts for the purpose of providing feedback on my service. For instance, I've just helped a client recover 25 btc from a semi-forgotten brainwallet, but he works for one of the major bitcoin wallet providers... and is a bit embarassed. But as normal, I ask my clients to post feedback, and reddit is normally their choice.
I've had over 700 clients now, and just by the nature of random stochastic processes, sometimes I solve a bunch of wallets within a short timeframe, or by chance a number of posts happen nearly consecutively.
Anyway, no great harm done, and I shall continue to provide a service to the community (and earn the odd bitcoin myself).
p.s. is by far the best location for bitcoin related news, so the moderators must be doing an ok job :)

In general, I prefer to remain anonymous. Having said that, some people in the crypto community do know who I am personally. Cheers

Hi ImportGuy, thanks for taking the time to post that review. I'm glad to be able to help you. Cheers, Dave.

Hi. Yes, I do litecoin wallet decryption. (the wallet format is identical to bitcoin-qt format). Please email me at walletrecoveryservices

Hi Aviad1234
Thanks for your feedback on the walletrecoveryservices.com service. Pleased to be able to help you :)
There is also another recent reddit thread,   which other readers might find relevant.

Hi. Thanks for the feedback, guys. Trust is a hard thing to build, but I'm going to do my best - by being scrupulously honest.
I do indeed want to build a long-term, sustainable business from this venture.
(If you wonder whether I need extra motivation to keep me honest, be aware that my kids look over my shoulder at my bitcoin work, and I have no intention of setting a bad example for them :)

Thanks sflicht for posting your feedback about my  service.
I'll address a couple of the thread comments:
1) I've written a set of C++ programs that I cross-compile onto Windows or Linux. This allows me to scale up processing power onto cheap(ish) Amazon AWS instances relatively easily.
2) These programs support 'brute-force decryption' of bitcoin/litecoin wallets, blockchain.info wallets, with support for multibit, armory and electrum shortly.
3) I've been working for the last few months on over 40 'forgotten password' wallets, from different people around the world. Many wallets only contain a few BTC, but some contain a lot more.
4) I've been able to solve/decrypt less than 35% of the wallets (so far). But work continues on improving the software...
5) I've dutifully returned all (recovered) funds to their owners, less a fee, which I generally set at 20% of the wallet contents, payable only if I succeed in the decryption.
6) I've asked a few of the people that I've helped to post a review of my services onto reddit or bitcointalk.org, but sflicht is the first to actually do so (thanks again)
7) Yes, the  website is a cheapy Weebly site. (I couldn't be bothered at this stage tarting it up :)
8) There isn't a positive financial return for me on this venture yet, but I hope to eventually break even or better. The skyrocketing BTC price should help ! :)
Cheers, 
Dave Bitcoin

That is great, asoltys. Very happy to help.

Until I read the second half of your post, I was about to suggest that you contact me. I run a service, walletrecoveryservices.com, that specialises in recovering the funds from wallets (bitcoin, litecoin, etc) for people who forget their passwords.
I am very glad that you recovered your BTC. 
If there are other people out there who have forgotten their bitcoin wallet passwords, please consider walletrecoveryservices.com :)

Hi. Thanks for the writeup! I'm glad we could get your wallet decrypted for you.

Yes, I try to recover/brute-force the password using any and all possible techniques. Certainly if the client has any memory at all of the password, then this is a hugely beneficial starting point. Otherwise, the encryption used is too strong to allow even a medium strength password (eg 10 random characters) to be cracked.

Hi. Sorry for the slow reply - I don't check my reddit messages often.
It sounds interesting - but I'm pretty snowed under right now with walletrecoveryservices work. But if you can send some info my way at walletrecoveryservices I'd love to read about what you are doing (even if I can't spend much time to help you)
@_date: 2013-11-14 10:15:44
Thanks for the feedback. I hope it will be useful to the bitcoin community. Dave
