I prefer the server PSU option since it gives me total control over the wiring. Some of my s1's are currently powered by ATX psu's but I',m not a fan of the unused cables.

Only thing that kept me on ghash was the shareholder payout. When auto payout hits, I  sent .90 to my wallet and the balance to an alt wallet for power expenses.
@_date: 2014-04-27 22:57:28
I hate you....
I can barely afford 3 of those fuckers.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:50:36
Thanks. 
Very interesting way to use a topbot
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:52:10
If by "Over 40%" you mean "31%" then yeah....
Current network hash rate is 76.4k TH/s
cex.io hash rate is 24.4k TH/s

@_date: 2014-01-28 17:45:20
Buying hashing shares on cex.io is irrelevant towards the 51% issue. Those are shares in hardware that is already in hand and is already mining. Changing ownership of said mining power doesn't affect hash rates. 
Now to cut their hashing share, users who own physical hardware (apparently a significant portion of their hash rate) could move their hardware to another pool.

Both the generosity of that first tip in this thread and the concept of btc in the dprk leave me in awe.

Damn, and my store is still inching towards the $500 mark

Glad I cleared out of Gox before things went south
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:24:02
This is true...
I wonder what that fat fuck is up to these days.
@_date: 2014-06-14 13:32:45
Buying shares in one pool vs another accomplishes nothing tangible given that the equipment owned by said pools will mine regardless
@_date: 2014-06-09 16:39:49
What kept me there for a while is the shareholder payout option. 90% went to my wallet and 10% went to another wallet to help offset power costs.
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:53:17
My bad.
I have an Android tablet for my crypto needs.
I love watching my LTC balance tick up. Hopefully I'll have enough for my 4th Antminer S1 soon.
Shit, then I'll need another PSU

Not that the iWhore comment was in any way necessary, but the rest is fairly accurate.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:41:57
That used to be the peak of my btc wealth. I could buy a lost of hashing power with that much :(
@_date: 2014-06-15 17:12:42
gigampz sells a refurb PSU and breakout board that will power a pair of s1's.
Don't know if it will handle a pair of overclocked ones, but it will power a pair of stock ones just fine.
@_date: 2014-04-01 00:52:33
I will never use that site again.

@_date: 2014-01-28 15:20:33
This is true.
I'm not going to stop accepting it, that's for sure.
@_date: 2014-02-06 09:14:04
Wait, they removed it AGAIN? Oh well, it's already on my phone.
@_date: 2014-01-14 14:27:00
When are they going to implement the selective pool ability (use your shares to mine on other pools)? That was one of their strategies.
@_date: 2014-06-03 12:39:45
I still have my blockchain app from the last time it was on the app store
@_date: 2014-05-25 18:38:51
At this point, any proof of Mt Gox acting in a fraudulent manner is redundant. We all know they're shady as fuck.
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:11:03
I didn't mean to suggest there would be no impact, only that the system would correct itself.

How would one file their taxes if they're paid (in part or completely) in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-05 15:01:49
A lot of things were (and in some cases are) illegal. That certainly has done little if anything to curb their use.
I would think if btc were to ever be "illegal" in any jurisdiction, paper wallets would surge in popularity.
@_date: 2014-05-08 08:52:52
The correct term is "no longer available"
My blockchain app is a functioning wallet

Awwwww how cute.  Gov Brown thinks he needed to give his permission for people to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-14 19:16:16
That's more of a long term impact

How does block withholding work? I mean how do you do it?
@_date: 2014-06-24 08:04:04
That's how bitcoins work....sending from one person to another
@_date: 2014-06-24 12:16:16
As far as people cranking up the difficulty and leaving...how does make the coin unuseable or unmineable?
Wouldn't the difficulty correct itself after a massive drop in hashing power?

People need better options to serve as an incentive to leave. 
All of these cex.io threads more or less equate to "stop doing what you like because it's bad".  Not too many people are going to quit.

Shit, I wonder how much I can get for my .5 btc notes
@_date: 2012-12-02 21:42:29
Probably one thing I won't be ordering over the internet (no offense).
I'm trying to offload some of my spare parts (computer) and what not.
@_date: 2012-11-30 18:23:57
Not saying I have any issue with their sell prices. Just wondering what the difference between their but and sell prices are
@_date: 2012-12-04 19:47:44
$31 would be nice. I'd probably drop some coin on more ASIC gear
@_date: 2012-12-03 19:10:05
Interesting read
@_date: 2012-12-13 00:58:31
Order too a smidge longer to fill than I would have preferred, but I recieved my 1oz Canadian Maple Leaf in the mail today.
YaY Coinabul.
@_date: 2012-08-10 16:21:01
I would definitely be interested in something like this.  I'd even consider investing a little.
@_date: 2012-12-16 22:32:12
Thank you sir
@_date: 2012-12-15 13:17:47
I tried executing that command and it didn't work when I tried the regular CPU version of the program it work
@_date: 2012-11-30 17:06:09
Does anyone know how much they discount what you offer them? I mean if they charge 2.5btc for $1 of silver coins (90%) how much could I expect them to pay?  I might have about 30 to 40 btc worth
@_date: 2012-08-18 16:49:11
I'm currently drafting up something to offer 1kh/s bonds on my ltc mining setup. 
@_date: 2012-12-27 03:07:29
Took about a week from initial upgrade request, new invoice, payment, and reciept. 
Outside of the chronic delay announcements, I would buy from them again.
@_date: 2012-12-01 13:54:05
I would like to sell my lot of 90% silver coins and don't see that option on your site (weight only). Trying to determine how much I would get before I decide to sell.
I believe I have aprox 10oz worth of silver...not sure on face value right now
@_date: 2012-12-02 17:19:38
For the ignorant, what are you selling?
@_date: 2012-11-30 13:03:04
Useful little tool. Only problem with using it for ASIC profitability is that you have to crank up the difficulty to an unpredictable level to determine the impact ASIC will have.
@_date: 2012-12-15 12:47:07
Yeah free BitCoin
@_date: 2012-12-15 00:59:40
I've already imported the private key.  I'll see if I can come up with something for @_date: 2012-08-19 16:55:08
I figure the price would drop when asic's hit due to their insane hashing power and the amount of btc it will create. Not saying it will crash
@_date: 2012-11-19 15:06:43
And this is news why?
@_date: 2012-11-19 15:23:12
I may only have 1/10 of the OPs coins, but they're in paper wallets. Problem solved
@_date: 2012-12-03 23:17:21
I just ordered it from coinabul several hours ago.
@_date: 2012-12-15 02:23:01
Blockchain.info has both web and smartphone wallet ability. I use it on my iphone
@_date: 2012-12-20 11:11:24
Try Bitmit
@_date: 2012-08-19 16:35:48
I was speaking with regards to a LTC mining operation, not btc. Once the ASIC CPUs hit, I would wager that the price of bitcoin would go down considerably
So yeah, if I had 500khs reliably, I would sell 400 1 khs bonds and use that surplus to keep a surplus coming in.
I also pre ordered one of those 3ghs ASIC devices mostly to play with.
Not to hijack the thread, but I would suggest underselling your hash power that way you will have a btc income if nobody made any sort of donations 
@_date: 2012-11-30 13:04:44
I trust or at least hope for a higher price. That's why I have  about 30btc so far in cold storage (offline)

And this is why I rarely use PayPal 
@_date: 2012-12-17 21:12:29
I'll just sit here and wait to see if my ASIC ships in the next couple of months. If not,  I know I can't cancel my order
@_date: 2012-08-12 22:16:42
Some of the pre order auctions I've seen are for retarded prices.
I pre-ordered a jalapeno directly from BFL.  
@_date: 2012-11-26 16:09:43
I have about 30 btc in offline wallets (paper bills) that I'd be willing to part with
@_date: 2012-11-29 12:34:04
The bitcoin community can't prevent illicit use of bitcoin assuming that was your point. If it could, would the Silk Road exist?
@_date: 2012-12-02 22:14:28
Congrats just the same. I have some silver I'm trying to sell and maybe an iPhone 3g
@_date: 2012-12-15 01:04:07
It was about the same, but before I left for work, I put my gpu miners back on, so I would guess it took a bit longer. It was done when I got home from work.
@_date: 2012-11-27 13:22:00
Cue the "Brace Yourselves xxxxxxxx is/are coming" meme
@_date: 2012-12-12 20:17:14
You could always sell some junk you don't need on bitmit (think eBay with bitcoin) and once you have a few btc there is btcjam (risky peer to peer lending). Would not recommend the latter for a btc noob to do something with his first few btc, got burned on my first investment but I didn't lose much.
@_date: 2012-12-19 11:34:15
Only thing I've bought s far is silver from coinabul. Fixing to sell some for Btc as well
@_date: 2012-12-14 22:41:01
If its not recognized by any gov as currency, is it really gambling?
@_date: 2012-08-19 23:08:07
Either way, (I'm not claiming to be a BTC economic expert), I bought one of the 3GH/s devices to play with when they do eventually ship
@_date: 2012-12-03 18:49:50
If you've got some silver you want to part with, I'll pay in bitcoin
@_date: 2012-12-16 17:56:04
I'll experiment with the pool when I get back to my gpus
@_date: 2012-12-15 13:42:26
Very interesting indeed
@_date: 2012-11-28 19:09:55
At least I can claim to be a part of that pool and active at the time the block was found
@_date: 2012-12-04 11:29:00
If I sell a paper bill, problem solved 
@_date: 2012-09-26 03:12:26
Too bad I cant afford one of those. Had to settle for a jalapeno (pre-order 4630). Wonder when/if I'll see it
@_date: 2012-12-03 19:09:16
I could have spent the 2x $20s in my wallet locally but I see your point
@_date: 2012-12-26 15:36:03
I pre-ordered a bfl jalapeño and later upgraded to a mini single.
@_date: 2012-12-16 17:49:09
Just the tip!
@_date: 2012-11-24 19:01:57
All opinions about the credibility of bfl aside, it's too bad this competitor doesn't offer more options (like a jalapeño equivalent). If I knew I could get something sooner, I'd cancel my bfl order in a heartbeat
@_date: 2012-11-19 15:07:37
Wonder how this will affect the exchange rate
@_date: 2012-12-01 14:54:11
Fair enough...I'll put some faith in them. Just need them to answer my one question before I decide to pack up my silver and mail it off
@_date: 2012-12-03 03:56:55
upvote for spreading the bitcoin love
@_date: 2012-12-16 01:18:14
I'm an idiot. I figured it out
@_date: 2012-12-01 16:56:43
Here is a picture of the silver. $14.40 face value
@_date: 2012-12-14 23:25:11
Without the cash buy in. Can't necessarily prove any cash was involved in the btc acquisition 
@_date: 2012-12-18 11:21:26
so simply running the client = node? 
Sorry for the dumb question, I primarily mine (BTC and LTC) and use an online based wallet for ease of access.
@_date: 2012-12-16 10:57:52
Awwww nobody wants a reddit address?  Apparently  my laptop can crank out 5 char addresses (6 including the 1)  fairly efficiently, while 7 char would take a while.
@_date: 2012-12-03 22:01:24
I like having a job in the military and I intend to keep it that way
@_date: 2012-10-27 12:55:41
Looks like BFL is trying to raise a few extra $$ by performing "quality control" on those ASIC's before shipping.
@_date: 2012-08-19 18:06:08
Wouldn't the difficulty adjust that much quicker?
@_date: 2012-12-15 11:11:54
oclvanitygen does not support the -P option while vanitygen does. It will take me 14 days to get to the 50% mark. If someone wants to go this route for a 1Reddit address, I'm willing to work with them (hopefully for a donation or tip or something for letting my CPU run at 100% for so long).
Shoot me PM's if anyone's interested in using the previously mentioned  option and we'll go from there.
@_date: 2012-12-03 19:48:58
Any idea what coinabul's turn around time is?
@_date: 2012-12-14 11:54:38
I'm trying to generate some 1Reddit addresses. Gpu power ftw (23MH/s from one gpu)
Any takers?
@_date: 2012-12-17 13:13:17

@_date: 2012-12-15 01:24:56
I'm new to vanity addresses, please explain what you just said like I'm 5
@_date: 2012-12-03 23:42:32
No need for further explanation sir. Given the incredible feedback this subreddit has given about coinabul, I have faith.
