Can someone ELI5 that last point before the "Recap" section?  It looks like I can take my balance off the LN and put it into cold storage from a networked hub.  
What stops a compromised hub from emptying nodes across the net into a cold storage wallet of their choosing?

Can someone ELI5 why someone on Gox can't just open another wallet elsewhere, on another exchange, and then transfer their BTC there and withdraw?  
If Alice is on Gox and stuck, why not send to Bob who can withdraw and then have Bob give her the $$?  Certainly would be better than leaving it in that money trap.

We're basically all friends now.  If your friend needs help, you give him a BTC.  That's kinda the rule.  You know I'd do the same for all of you if i discovered I was an overnight millionaire.

Well isn't the whole point of cross-chain swaps the fact that the merchants don't have to accept it anymore?
This way, you can pay in whatever crypto you want, but the merchant gets paid in dollars or Euros or whatever they want.

Too much focus on get rich quick schemes and not enough focus on what it takes to make a stable, dependable, functioning currency.

Exactly.  Don't expect a "too big to fail" bailout in this industry.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:47:56
Yes, I've done this before by just deleting the transaction from your wallet.dat, reloading the wallet into Core, and respending with a higher fee.  The secret be transaction went through first and the original TX just never went through.

I suppose that's great for BTC, but to be honest I don't know a single person who tunes in for tv shows anymore.  That 14M+ people will turn on CBS that night really is mind boggling to me.

In your wallet.  Currency on the exchange is not fully yours.  BTC in your wallet is under your own personal control.  You can save it, spend it, or lose it without asking permission.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:58:31
Well a paper wallet is one option, a hardware wallet with an offline backup is probably better.  Just get a cheap thumb drive and periodically back up your wallet / BTC addresses.  "Write the entire wallet passkeys" starts to get dangerous because if you screw up 1 letter you are referencing an address that you don't own.  The idea is just to keep the backup somewhere off the grid, fireproof, floodproof, theftproof.  Anyone who says it has to be paper is just going too extreme.  
Think of your off-grid backup as the bank--you can access the money but it will take some work.  Your on-grid money in your hardware wallet is like the cash you have in your billfold/purse--enough to get through the week/month, but if you plan to buy a car you're gonna have to break into savings.

I'd beg to differ.  Once the casino saw the transaction hit the network they credited my account and I played with that money for a few hours.  I was, ahem, not successful.  After I had lost a portion of it, I decided to walk away and get my balance back.  They would not allow me to cash out in BTC for some reason, so I decided to do things my way.  
I do consider it a double spend since I gambled with it.  Had I hit the jackpot, I obviously would have waited however many days to get the payout.  Since I lost, I looked for a way to retrieve my funds since they had not been confirmed after a few days.
I never thought of sending them to myself, that might have been faster.  Still, buying stuff on Newegg took around 10 min.
@_date: 2017-07-03 01:05:42
Depends on the platform.  I did a doublespend with Core by just deleting the transaction in my wallet.dat file, resyncing, and then spending again with a higher fee.  The second transaction hit the network and was confirmed in a couple of minutes and the first transaction obviously got rejected whenever it came up for confirmation.
But it would probably be more difficult on mobile.
Edit:  I should probably be clear that I am not recommending stiffing anyone a payment they are due.  My scenario involved an online casino that wasn't honoring their end of the agreement, so I had no ethical issues yanking back the BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:22:44
When you get a transaction that hangs like that, it is possible to double-spend the BTC.  Several months ago I sent a transaction to a recipient and put only a modest fee associated with it.  The recipient saw the transaction hit the network and credited my account and it was immediately available for use in the online casino.  After five days the transaction still had not been included in the blockchain, and the casino wouldn't allow me to withdraw my funds.  
I actually was able to go in to my wallet.dat file and delete the transaction, reload the file into my client, and re-spend the funds with a higher fee (which was immediately acknowledged and included in the blockchain).  
The point I'm trying to make is that delays in confirmation are actually creating an environment that allows a "race condition" to take place wherein a person can double-spend BTC.  This was one of the key tenets of security that got me on board with cryptocurrency and now it's failing.  Just as I cannot use a single gold coin to simultaneously pay two separate vendors, I shouldn't be able to have multiple transactions in the ether waiting to see which address gets the same BTC first. 
In my case, the casino got shorted since (I presume) by the time it came time for that transaction to get picked up, the funds had already been spent and confirmed at an online store.

:-)  as long as you and I aren't the ones getting screwed.  I'm not waiting in a parking lot with my merchandise for five hours waiting for a confirmation. :-)

That's pretty myopic.  If every single kilowatt was purchased by an eccentric billionaire, energy companies out there would flex heavily into the market to increase production and output.  It may initially be impractical or expensive for the average customer to get in TODAY, but in short order the cost of entry into solar/renewables would go down as a result of the influx of supply.

No, not just to random wallets.  He could just send it to my wallet and I'd give him back 80% when he got out.

American here:  70% of us are in debt.
That means that if you don't owe the bank anything and still have a quarter in your pocket, you're in the top 30% of the population.  That's one reason why the average person isn't flocking to buy gold bullion and BitCoin.  If I have a $120K mortgage the last thing I am going to do is buy an ingot of gold.
@_date: 2013-10-12 18:38:35
Not now, but it can be.  If PayPal and nearly every major bank are able to make a moderately secure, user friendly interface that works, the BTC community can and will do it as well.  Sure there are scams, sure there is theft, but that exists with every currency.
The rate that BTC adoption has increased in third-world counties would argue that the average person is more than capable of using in lieu of fiat.
@_date: 2013-11-01 22:57:59
I'm definitely a proponent of BTC, and I've invested enough to play around with it and have own over three friends.  What I'm saying in the original post is that you really have to buy in to see what it's all about.

It's like watching the Gold Rush show and seeing all the earth movers, mine equipment, and high-tech sluice boxes.   I think we all have nostalgia for the days when you could squat by the riverside with a pie tin and pan for gold, always hoping to hit that nugget.

We obviously all agree that security is paramount when dealing with a digital currency, but I think comments like this are working against mass acceptance of BTC as a legitimate, flexible, useful option.  
I WANT a currency that the "retards" buying my crap on Craigslist can use.  If web wallets are out and you need a Master's in IT to protect your $$, it doesn't sound appealing to "Joe Six-pack"
@_date: 2013-11-01 13:54:32
It is an interesting phenomena when you have to explain to someone else why they would want to get involved in a digital currency that is (a) harder to get into than PayPal, (b) has less adopters than PayPal, (c) has no recourse if the transaction ends up being fraudulent, etc.
Really the best way is to do just what you did, throw $20 into the system to buy 0.1 BTC and then buy something with it, trade it for something, or just hang on to it.  Now that you've got "skin in the game" you can speak with authority as to your motivation for being an adopter.
@_date: 2013-11-01 20:38:28
While I know many people (especially people who have been scammed through PayPal) do not like the trust factor inherent in that system, many do.  I'd like to know that if I buy a $1000 product from you and you choose not to send it, that I can have someone arbitrate my claim.  
If you were making the same trade, you'd be stupid not to trade through an escrow account, so I guess I'm missing the point of your argument.
