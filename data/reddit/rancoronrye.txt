Definitely not a scam, saying so dilutes the meaning and makes the accusations meaningless. Being precise and accurate in your arguments would go a lot further in swaying peoples opinions.

The issue is that bitcoin.com promotes Bcash first which is contrary to what you would expect from the name.

Where? Go on the site and they differentiate between the two of them at every turn and explain their reasoning. It's reasoning from their perspective be aware but still reasoning nonetheless.

The scam accusations on this sub and the censorship ones on the other sub get old really fast. The amount of effort put into hating each other is ridiculous.

So what I'm gathering is that it's a scam because they use their positioning (the name of the site) to get at new users first and give them their side of the story to turn them off of btc and onto bch thus inflating the price and lining the pockets of those who push the coin.

Only if they promote bch as btc, which they don't. They clearly define both of them on the site and even differentiate between the two. 
Is it confusing for a site called bitcoin.com to promote bitcoin cash first? Yes. Is it a scam? No, because they clearly define the two of them throughout the site.

Users being dumb is beyond anybody's control, doesn't mean it's a scam coin. There's actually multiple coins this sort of thing can happen with.

That shitty alt-coin is 4th in market cap and I don't think anybody has lost money to the site unless you have more info that says otherwise. Calling it a scam is just stupid and inaccurate. Bitconnect, that was a scam. 
The site also does differentiate between them, but it puts Bcash first which is confusing yes.

The &amp; debate is over! Long live @_date: 2018-06-27 21:18:30
I highly doubt you've ever done either of those things.

This is the silliest thing I've read all day lol
