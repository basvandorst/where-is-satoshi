You guys realize that when a company 'accepts' bitcoin they are just looking for a brief spike in their sales. They don't actually handle any of the bitcoins, they have a middleman who accepts the risk in the holding and converting. Newegg isn't collecting bitcoins they are immediately having them traded in for actual currency which won't fluctuate weekly. God there's even a thread saying that Newegg employees should request to be paid in this fun money, are you guys shitting me?
When a company says 'we are now accepting bitcoins' they don't actually touch any of the bitcoins (who the hell would), they just know gullible people will spend their money in order to Support Bitcoin. The coins are dumped back to you dummies or left to speculators who will resell them when Another New Company 'accepts' bitcoins and the price rises for a bit.
There is nothing actually Happening here, Newegg is gonna make a ton of money and you people are gonna be left holding the bag, for fucks sake just stop this before you end up starving to death. 
e: The hilarious thing is Newegg DOES get it, they completely get it. Just not in the way that you think.

There is an online pet-sitting agency who now have a big 'Pay With Bitcoin' stamp on their website! It's true! Have you heard about this new vending machine down the street that's now taking Bitcoins? But now with Newegg the revolution is really coming, I can feel it. Let's all sit around a table and have really smart and important thinks about how this pans for the future of b'coin, and if we do this enough times it will feel like we are actually reaching some kind of meaningful conclusion.

This entire process is very clearly all about short-term acquisition, when Newegg implies that they're in this for the long haul and this is just the beginning they are LYING. They will drop this shit when their middleman, which is probably just a crappy startup, bottoms out or when it's clear the bubble has burst. The 'acceptance' of bitcoin by organizations is not going to stabilize the currency, everything they are doing is meant to do the exact opposite; to create a lot of short-term gains very quickly at cost to you people. You aren't getting in on the ground floor of a monetary revolution, you're being taken for a fucking ride.
