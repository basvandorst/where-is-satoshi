I absolutely will do it as soon as I get back. I wont have any money to add into it until payday (tomorrow) but I'll mess around with it. And I'll pm you with any more questions. I appreciate everything :D

Again I'm not buying it for investment purposes I'm buying it because it is the only form of currency I can use to purchase what I want to purchase. And I'm asking these question in hopes that I can understand it, so you really didn't help the process at all :/

No I haven't set up a wallet yet because I wanted to be sure I knew what I was doing before I started anything. And it would probably be around 400 dollars I'd be spending so I'm not sure if that counts as small enough of a transaction to use an online wallet or not

Awesome. Thanks a lot! Is there any sort of time limit on this I still have an hour and a half left at work and I don't want to use my work computer for any of this stuff

Also one more question...say I want to add more than 400 worth of coins in the future. Should I then find a wallet that isn't online? I'm guessing one that sits on your personal computer.

If anyone wants to recommend their personal favorite wallets or exchange methods I would appreciate that feedback as well. I'm trying to be as informed as possible so I can do this without losing any money haha.

Look I didn't ask for your opinions on anything. I was asking for answers to my questions. And obviously there's a whole site dedicated to people taking bitcoins for drugs so I doubt I'll have too much trouble on that front.

Thanks for that. One more thing, are there some exchangers that are more reputable or quicker than others?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:02:28
I will. Thanks!
