Wouldn't it be easier on bitcoin? It's anonymous and such.

Oh yeah!

It's nice that you made some cash but, I don't really like people looking at Bitcoins as a form of stocks to buy and sell for profit, it's a currency that's meant to be used, I know it probably hard for you to use Bitcoins for everyday things at the moment but hopefully that will change soon.

Any help would be greatly appreciated! I would really like to use bitcoins seeing how they could be viable option for purchases soon in the "real world" !!!

I just grabbed a bitcoin client, I've known about it for a few years and I'm glad this is going to be a more widely accepted currency soon(now?) or in the near future!

Alright, thank you!
Looks like bitcoins really moving right now, I'll probably wait to actually buy some for a little less, I don't really plan on using them as "stock", but as an actuall currency.

Could someone explain this to me please. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:32:59
Oh really, all I have for extra cash at the moment and would love to get into the bitcoin market.

That comparison was awesome and deserves a tip, I would give you one but I have about 13 cents in Bitcoins.

Hopefully this is some sort of testing to try it out, if Starbucks starts accepting BTC that could definately bring some more people into the BTC crowd.

This confuses me also, why would there be change?
