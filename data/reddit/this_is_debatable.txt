Did you look into getting a PO Box?

Looks like bits are here to stay. I'm liking it. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:22:09
Holy crap is this a record for number of people receiving gold in a thread?
@_date: 2014-11-30 17:53:59
This is so cool! This is what happens when steam doesn't accept cryptocurrency. Innovation at it's finest.

So much tipping going around lately. It feels like pre $1200 bubble.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:07:10
I got .0016 a moment ago. About $1.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:29:40
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-01-28 01:03:21
Andreas is doing an amazing job at explaining bitcoin to Joe. I'm actually learning things I didn't know before I joined.
@_date: 2014-06-16 21:50:26
I'll have just the tip ;)
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:58:37
Congratulations blockchain! Not too long ago you guys were at 1 million, so great growth pattern.
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:34:57
Is this going to be a direct competitor to the other Mexican BTC exchange 
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:22:20
I keep scrolling and not a single yes. Lots of hate on Twitter. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:46:50
You can gamble using bitcoin online if that's what you're into. I think the website is    
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:09:15
Smart of them to use Coinbase instead of implementing their own process which would take a long time. Lets see what comes of this.
@_date: 2014-11-06 15:00:30
Hasn't c changetip been around for a while? Or was that a different thing?
@_date: 2014-05-16 18:33:08
The fees on Coinbase are too high to make it worth my while. 
Is that a guess on how they are going to monetize the company, or was it mentioned in the article? I'd like to see what exchange/s they use.
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:13:43
 &gt;People here who saw my posts will know who I am by the words I use
@_date: 2014-05-16 15:38:42
Hmm. I send my dad a few hundred every month through BoA wire transfer. If I can convince him to get an account on Circle I can buy the dollar amount of bitcoins, send it to his account, and he can withdraw it to his BoA account without any fees.
I save money, he gets the full amount...everybody wins.
I like where this is headed.
@_date: 2014-05-08 17:43:44
I'll have a byte of bitcoin.

Why did Timmy fall of his bike?
Because he had no arms. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:16:11
People here seem happier these last couple of days with all the tipping. I like seeing this. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:12:00


@_date: 2014-01-31 22:30:36
Very cool, I definitely agree.  Best of luck. I will let all my family back in Mexico know about this (the techies) at least.

Any idea as to the US stance on Securities i.e. stocks bought with bitcoin that receive bitcoin derivatives?
@_date: 2015-05-02 02:58:50
Fuck them....pieces of shit with nothing productive to show for their script kiddy skills.

I don't follow this mindset. It's so stupid. So NFL players that have raped and murdered someone get off scot-free. Wouldn't you want them to go to prison? Why would you want to free Ross so both him and NFL players are free? Wouldn't you want both to be in prison for attempted murder? Wouldn't you want someone who creates a platform for distributing drugs, firearms, and hitmen in jail?
Is it because he helped with the boom of the bitcoin economy that people think he should get a free pass?
 I can't speak for the life sentence he got because the American system is so convoluted and played with, but everyone you mentioned should get tried for their crimes.

Yes but the weighted winnings are heavily against you to the point where you really don't get anything out of it.
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:08:28
Someone ended up betting 1,000 btc on no after that which screwed over everyone who bet on no. I was going to end up winning something like 21 btc on a 0.1 btc bet, but now my estimate winnings are something like 0.07 btc (rough estimates).
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:38:40
@_date: 2015-01-03 22:35:52
It's exactly how it works, unfortunately. It's a weighted bet and future bets affect the winnings of people who bet before. This is why bitbet is not really a good place to bet. People speculated that the 1k on no was the same person who bet 1k on yes trying to hedge his losses when they figured btc wouldn't out-perform brk-a. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 20:50:29
Hmm I'd contact support. Literally tried that myself hours ago without issue. 
@_date: 2015-05-14 16:24:38
Looking a lot more like Venmo these days, which I have found to be very useful.
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:45:47
In what way would it be a catastrophic failure?

Good to hear!
@_date: 2015-08-19 15:31:52
While it may be factual and negative, the fact that you can't post factual and positive news is bullshit hypocrisy regarding their own rules.

You must be retarded. 
See: Any student who received a full ride to any school from the Gates Millennium Scholarship. There's countless examples of Gates giving away his wealth, but I'll stop here because you might need to hire someone to teach you how to google search.

It wouldn't, he's a dumbass.
@_date: 2015-04-10 21:33:23
All the faucets I've tried made it almost impossible to withdraw. I've been nothing but disappointed with them, so it's good to hear there's legitimate faucets out there.
@_date: 2015-03-17 23:13:21
woop woop, here for the bits
@_date: 2015-03-18 17:11:43
Heh, made $32...at least it's something.

Kept getting invalid promo and now they're under scheduled maintenance  ...oh well.
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:55:20
I have heard about bitquick but only through word of mouth. You guys seem to do a good job from what my friend tells me. 
I'll have to check you guys out myself to answer the questions. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:34:35
Came back online and promo worked!
@_date: 2015-02-09 19:48:11
I'm on board!

You can sue for defamation in the state of California. Whether or not it's a winnable case is moot since they'll settle out of court.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:59:09
You can sue for libel and harassment.

Thanks for the link, I'll read up on it more then. It seems like everyone is in agreement that bitcoins are too difficult to mine, but what about other currencies like litecoins?
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:12:04
Wow, thanks for the free money! I just started learning about bitcoin/litecoin not too long ago, so lets see what happens.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:30:44
Isn't that true of every other type of currency? Gold is only valuable because we say it is and because there is a finite amount of it in the world. Same with silver, same with bitcoin, litecoin, etc. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 14:18:14
Can you run multiple block erupters at once? So, say you have 4 usb ports at 336 MH/s ea. for a total of 1.34 GH/s?
@_date: 2013-11-07 01:36:46
Ah, alright. Sort of like a little game of "have free money"?
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:12:44
Hahaha, thank you! You certainly beat him by a whole dollar!
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:49:42
Very interesting. Thanks for the information, I'll see if I can modify my current rig into a mining one and save some money on the build.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:48:47
You guys are more gullible than my retarded sister.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:51:46
I have no idea what is going on here with this flippy thing, but I'm getting more and more interested in online currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:27:10
Yeah, I believe the current 50GH/s miner is a bit more than twice that amount and apparently the company is a bit sketchy.
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:49:25
I just joined too. Look into other cryptocurrencies if you want to see what's going on a larger scale. This is all very exciting and scary stuff.
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:10:35
This seems interesting, but power consumption might be a big drawback. Thanks for the link--I'll need to do more research.
@_date: 2013-11-06 20:33:11
What is the best course of action if we get pushed into a bubble? Sell? Wait it out?
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:26:19
Ouch, 98 years is crazy. I guess I got into it a bit too late, but I do enjoy watching the numbers much like yourself, so I might just build a rig myself or try out the high performance bitmining machines for fun.
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:54:08
What did that do?
