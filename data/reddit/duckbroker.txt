When is CGT payable? Do I only need to declare the capital gains when I cash out back to fiat? i.e. if I am just holding it in bitcoin and the value accumulates, I don't need to report the gain in value on my tax?
What about if I trade back and forth between cash and crypto on an exchange but never actually withdraw any fiat. Do I need to track the capital gain/loss for each individual trade?
Lastly, is it FIFO or LIFO for reporting CGT. Say I bought one btc for 3000 then a second at 10000 before selling one at 12000, is that a 9000 capital gain or a 2000 capital gain?

Has the transaction already confirmed on the blockchain? If not you could try to send the same inputs to the correct address with higher fees and it should confirm first. Will be very hard to do in a timely manner given it was from an exchange.

Absolutely that is the risk. If your money is on the exchange then it's their money. But I guess the point is we shouldn't congratulate an exchange for doing something that is against the spirit of cryptocurrency just because this time it's good for our coin and bad for our competition. Next time it may be the other way around.
EDIT: Also I know they have a policy in hard forks and their customers therefore should known that they wouldn't get bcash so I'm not that critical of the exchange. I think more than anything I'm just a bit frustrated by the vitriol from the community as a whole. Just seems pointless and harmful to the technology itself.

Seriously? 5 days ago you were worried about bitcoin dipping from 7800 to 6500 but now you're ready to throw 2 million dollars into it? Based on advice from reddit? Why do people keep posting these "hey guys I want to invest millions of dollars into crypto" posts? Is it just attempt to pump the market a little? I don't think 2 mil is enough to do that anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:18:05
Yeah you're absolutely correct that they have the right to decide whether to give you bcash or not. They did have a published policy and I'm sure people who kept their coins on the exchange during the fork did so knowingly.
To clarify my thoughts I'm not necessarily arguing that BitMEX has done anything wrong. What I am saying is I don't think they have done something good either that is worthy of us congratulating them as if they are helping us fight our enemies. They have made a business decision that is inline with their terms of service and that's ok but the thing that would make me congratulate them is if they said "well looks bcash is definitely a thing and it does have genuine supporters so we'll distribute the coins and let users do what they want with it."
Do they have to support every fork that comes along? No but clearly bcash has a decent user base. Realistically forks are going to be part and parcel of what bitcoin is. This is not the first and won't be the last. The right to fork bitcoin is part of the freedoms of open source software and open source cryptocurrency. Allowing people to do so freely is important. The bitcoin community is going to have to learn to accept forks as perfectly valid ways of developing cryptocurrency as a whole and we're going to have to learn to do it with maturity rather than seeing it as a war of us vs them.

Yeah fair call. I've got to say I'm an optimist when it comes to the technology but really turned off by the community and politics at the moment. The absolute  shit-show of bickering and arguing recently is pathetic.
Bitcoin is still in its infancy right now. The problems we currently face are the easy ones. Our community is currently small and tight knit. The special interest groups are all small potatoes at the moment. If we can't even have a civil and productive discourse now, we're really going to struggle when things get truly hard.
I'm with you 100% that I'm worried about the recent trend but it's the cultural trend rather than the technological one that worries me the most. Sadly that's probably also the hardest thing to fix.
All that said, you've clearly been here a long time. Certainly a lot longer than I have. I'm assuming you've seen how good bitcoin can be when it's working as intended. Just got to find a way to get back there.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:03:08
Huh. Interesting. It does show you that using bitcoin still does need a fair bit of technical savy to understand all the quirks. Plenty of other examples too. I know the current focus is on scalability but I guess user friendliness will eventually have to be something worked on before we get to mainstream adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:59:52
The fees won't be constant. If bitcoin is worth a million dollars, the fee might only be 10 satoshis. But yes, transaction scaling is an acknowledged issue. That's what the last few months (years) of debate has been about. Lots of proposed solutions. Many more still to be proposed. Time will tell which of those are adopted by the community and which of those should have been adopted. The goal very clearly is that transaction costs will be very low. Problem is we haven't gotten the right solution yet. Doesn't mean we never will.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:16:21
Is the following scenario possible then:
I broadcast a transaction with a very low fee. It doesn't get confirmed and drops off the mempool my wallet watches and so the money just shows up back in my wallet. I decide not to resend the transaction for whatever reason (maybe I just paid the other person in fiat instead). I continue as I am but don't spend that bitcoin anywhere else either.
Weeks, months, years later someone whose node never timed out my transaction mines a block and includes my transaction. Suddenly my coin is spent when I wasn't expecting it to.
I know it's extremely unlikely but just wondering if it could actually happen that way?

Really good explanation from a little while ago by u/fresheneesz.
 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:07:01
No it's not. Imagine what you'd say if they did it the other way around. Or if after the B2X fork (if it happens) they unilaterally decided to sell your original chain coins and credit you B2X. You'd lose your shit.
Cryptocurrency is supposed to be about giving people control of their money. If people want to keep/trade/use bcash then more power to them. Bitcoin shows it's strength and value by growing in spite of these competing coins.
The way to do it would simply have been for them to acknowledge that bcash exists, credit their users with the coins and let individuals decide what they want to do with it. If the users want to sell it all for BTC no problems. But let the individuals decide for themselves.

Wow! Fantastic write-up. I have to admit up until this point I'd never fully understood what the big problem with s2x was. I kind of just shrugged and thought that it seemed a fair compromise between the segwit and the big block groups, why not just implement it. This really clearly lays out the tangible problems that 2x poses. Really just clicked everything for me.
As a side-note, is this not a problem for other currencies with short block times then. Doesn't ethereum have a 2min block time? Aren't dash and xrp block times in the seconds? Why aren't they all completely centralised then? Surely no matter how small their blocks they can't propagate quickly enough.

I asked a question about zero-conf transactions recently and got some pretty good answers. For low-value transactions, it's probably fine for the merchant to use them, maybe checking that the transaction fee was reasonable first. Yes they might get cheated, but if it was for a $3 cup of coffee they might be happy to take the risk for the added customers they might get with more convenient payments.

This will end up as a bit of a prisoner's dilemma situation though won't it? Yes if everyone holds bitcoin will lose its value as a currency but at the same time, each individual will want to hold onto their bitcoin just a little longer so it goes up in price whist others stabilise the price and give the coin legitimacy by using it as a currency rather than an investment.
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:25:05
I thought it's easy to create a fake transaction though and it's only the process of mining a block that verifies or rejects the transaction?
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:17:11
What's the drawback of increasing the block size? I've been trying to follow this debate and don't really follow why this compromise is such a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-06-16 03:27:15
For small amounts like that it really shouldn't affect things too much just buying off an exchange. Usually I tend to save up until I have at least a billion dollars before I buy. It's just not worth the hassle for anything smaller right?
Still I guess 1 million isn't such a bad start. I mean, 5 months ago you almost owned a full bitcoin. A few months ago you were excited by the $5000 it was worth. That trade for a few bucks profit was a good move a few days ago. I guess you must have done a couple hundred thousand more of those since then. It's solid work.
Anyway, yeah I think a million dollars should be a pretty easy buy. Just be careful. I've seen people try to pump the value by making some pretty silly posts on reddit. It's usually pretty obvious but still. I'd hate for a fellow billionaire like myself to fall for something so stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:09:35
I hear they also love handing over millions of dollars to people who learn how to invest on reddit.

I wonder would it be possible to measure actual fiat-to-crypto inflow? Kind of an area under the curve type thing so if 999 coins are bought for $1 then.1 for $100,000 you'd get a market cap of $100,999 rather than $100,000,000. I know that that wouldn't necessarily be an accurate measure of current value but with all cryptos a large proportion of the coins were mined or bought at much lower values than current market prices at which a relatively small portion actually turn over. It might be a more accurate measure of how much fiat has actually flowed into a given crypto
