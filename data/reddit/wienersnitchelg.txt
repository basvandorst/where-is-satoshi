Also know there is a chance it never goes below 10k again, if the “time traveler” is correct then it will drop back to 20k after this bull run and 15k very briefly

Yes Coinbase pro is safe and the fees are going to be less to transfer from there vs coinbase

The conspiracy to me is someone (TPTB) would want a situation to play out that way.

Hell, sounds to me like this guy is gonna be in the top 1% if he can hodl for that long.
@_date: 2019-11-03 18:06:28
I’m not sure tbh. If you plan on spending BTC for goods then 1) you’re doing it wrong and 2) if enough people are doing that then the system may get backed up. I think it’s main use is a great store of value given it’s the hardest asset ever.
@_date: 2019-11-03 07:06:50
I know this isn’t necessarily the place for conspiracy but hear me out. If the global recession comes to fruition bitcoin may be in the midst of a bull run. As people flee to hard assets, people will be choosing bitcoin as their safe-haven. Given the way bitcoin’s market works and how we’ve seen it function in the past I would not be at all surprised if there is a huge bust that causes people to panic sell or hodl and lose 70+% in value. This will likely result in people not wanting to touch bitcoin given this scenario and the global economic situation, however, this may be the last big bust bitcoin sees. Easy way to trick a large percentage of the global population into not touching the digital gold. HODL!

For real, I hope this fucker makes bitcoin go to zero but he’s too smart to. He knows what it is and it’s gonna shake the system some but if him/other elites play their cards right they can use it to gain a bigger gap in the wealth distribution. Personally I think bitcoin is gonna be in a bull run when the global recession becomes obvious and people will FOMO into a huge dump, this is gonna cause people to sell and lose faith for bitcoin but just when it’s looking bad enough it’s gonna reverse and never come back down. Good way to make sure bitcoin stays in the hands of a few.
@_date: 2019-11-03 20:21:18
Like others have said, you don’t need to think in terms of Bitcoin because that is equivalent to 1000 satoshis or what not. Also I HIGHLY HIGHLY doubt BTC will become a regularly used currency. I think most of it’s use in a trustless store of value that uses it’s on anonymous open source blockchain. It will be a safe-haven for value that can easily be transferred (generally in large settlements is my guess)
@_date: 2019-11-03 22:18:25
It’s more to do with people who don’t hold crypto though... if a well known investor like Buffett is telling people who don’t know shit about investing that he doesn’t like bitcoin, well guess what, now those people don’t believe it’s a good idea.

Should we suspect when the time comes (probably already has) the U.S. will be buying bitcoin not only as a better gold but also to make Russia’s gold collections worth less?
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:06:58
I’m so curious as to what happens next. If Edward Snowden is alluding to Asuka it could mean a three scenarios. 1)Enough believing in the prophecy so it self-fulfills. 2)An anonymous person knew it would gain influence and helping to create the most insane rally ever. 3)An anonymous person knew it would gain influence and is going to use it to create absolute panic if we begin to fall again. HODL
@_date: 2019-10-08 23:30:42
It’s because people are putting in shorts and longs. These whales probably let us place our bets and I’d even say manipulate it in a way that makes the majority think it’s headed in one direction while they move it in the other. My bets are we haven’t seen this bottom yet
@_date: 2019-10-31 06:13:45
Pretty damn sure this guy knows what bitcoin is, owns bitcoin, and given his wealth it is the last thing he wants to share with the world. He has a cheeky smile when he makes his big statement that tells me “I know I’m wrong, but I’ve gotta say this to get people off my case about bitcoin”.

@_date: 2019-10-30 00:41:52
I’m thinking this scenario is likely. The prophecy helped create FOMO for a 3k pump and once it’s put to rest it, if the trading conditions are right, it will help create panic to drop the price close to 50%
@_date: 2019-10-05 05:35:59
Bitcoin is cool because of no debt. Whenever a cryptocurrency figures out how to include debt into it’s blockchain you can go ahead and call that the mark of the beast/devil. My take on it is this will probably be issued by a type of government or order and implies that people may be born into debt if their family owes a debt (essentially slavery especially if that debt is unreasonably large, and we all know debt can become unreasonably large).
@_date: 2019-10-07 07:21:22
My guess is the 3x run up from 4K to 12k in 3 months consisted of some huge artificial inflation that we are shaking off. I’m a conspiracy guy so dismiss me if you will but I’m thinking somebody or more likely a group is trying make bitcoin look like a scary investment. With the recession upcoming somebody plans to keep the price down so they have time to scoop up cheap bitcoin while scaring newcomers (they either see it dropping and don’t buy or buy and panic sell when they see they’ve lost 10%+). Hodl tight and expect this bear market to be over in the near future. We aren’t in the endgame yet, but we’re far from the start.
@_date: 2019-10-24 02:09:17
People are stupid lmao. The answer is yes. Bull market -&gt; bear market -&gt; bull market
@_date: 2019-10-16 21:41:40
So what exactly is the point of the order if you don’t want it filled?
@_date: 2019-10-26 06:13:46
I’m wondering if he’s saying he knows or is Asuka or if it’s just an allusion to the absolutely insane FOMO that just took place from 7.5k to 10.5k which may have resulted from people buying into the prophecy.
@_date: 2019-10-30 06:33:31
Hey coins! How funny would it have been had people took advantage of the whale’s massive pump and instead of FOMO they all sold on their 40% gains. In another world
@_date: 2019-10-01 01:19:02
Exactly what I was thinking lmao. Dude risked it for the biscuit at 100x
@_date: 2019-10-28 18:07:36
I feel like Snowden’s reference to this is more of a take on how 1 popular internet post can create insane FOMO
@_date: 2019-10-09 20:57:11
Not 100% sure how futures work but if I’m correct they could also say they predict the price to be less in a month than it is today.  That way they pay less for the bitcoin they receive hoping that later on it appreciates in value
@_date: 2019-10-30 06:22:09
This is a hard one to answer. Personally I think bitcoin is undervalued due to how I believe it will be used as a store of value in the future given it’s utility. However, the market is less regulated than a traditional market which makes it rather easy for big money to manipulate it. Anything sub 10k is a good buying price for people who aren’t closely involved in the market. HODL and know that bitcoin WILL be worth more in 1 year, 3 years, 10 years, etc...
@_date: 2019-10-15 06:47:11
Could the golden cross forking at the peak of a bull market/start of a bear market be less significant than a death cross in what seems to be the middle of a bear market? Granted we won’t know for sure where we are in this bear market for another month or two
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:55:36
Unless the price falls $1000 rapidly. Not saying it will but another large move in the opposite direction at this point will certainly cause panic. “Are we going to 5k?”, “is it a long squeeze”, “HODL”
@_date: 2019-06-01 07:16:59
Today’s the day boys! We continue to HODL

What are your thought on the possibility we are experiencing the top of a bear flag right now?
@_date: 2019-12-30 18:42:21
Agenda for the big players into Bitcoin surely want a lower price with less market participants so they can scoop their bags with ease.
@_date: 2019-12-26 22:39:41
I have a theory the recent censorstion of bitcoin talk is because bitcoin is soon to bottom out. They don’t want it on everyone’s radar at this time but will spike interest again around April. Be smart. Stack your sats in the next few months.
@_date: 2019-09-30 16:55:41
I’m speculating that we may see another gradual fall look like it’s headed for 7k but before or after we touch we are gonna pull back and leave some people in the dust
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:55:52
This exactly. Plus the prophecy is vague tbh. It’s literally an analysis of the where the chart could be headed. Lot’s of room in the for it to be correct and off at the same time. I’d say it’s probably a good estimate at the moment of where Bitcoin’s price may be headed but place your bets on the prophecy at your own risk.
@_date: 2019-09-22 02:52:19
I.e. Mark of the Devil (centralized and more than likely not bitcoin)
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:22:48
Of course that’s how the chart plays but it’s beginning to look like we might see that dip that possibly touches in the 8k-9k area before hand
@_date: 2019-09-24 06:25:44
Possibly. I think we are going to test the support at 9.4k Tuesday or Wednesday. If it breaks expect chaos. Likely spend a bit of the day below that with some high volatility before pushing back and moon? I hope
@_date: 2019-09-22 01:29:54

This is how the whales work. Watch out for anything sub 8k. Bullish sentiment is turning bearish rn which is where people get left behind.

Fine, I’ll play the devil’s advocate and say that bitcoin is not currency either, it’s a piece of code
@_date: 2019-09-19 02:32:33
Someone is causing these dips. Starting to feel like the obvious signs point towards bitcoin pumping up but imo I could see the people behind the scenes manipulating this thing down first. This seems like the tip of an iceberg that’s slowing melting as it flips
