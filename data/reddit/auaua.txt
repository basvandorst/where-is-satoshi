Do a Google search for bitcoin take schedule.  It allows you to take profits when the price doubles, and keep the primary hoard intact.

Because I hold a small amount of BTC, therefore if oil is ever traded for BTC on a mass scale, I would probably be able to pay off some of my old fashioned, american college debt.
Another reason, besides the self serving reason of having Bitcoin go up in value because I hold some is, that there would be less wars raged over control of the worlds oil fields.  I'm all for peace, man.

Not every one has bank accounts, especially the third world.  In America, I generally agree, except when people leave their coins on unsavory exchanges...

If merchants offered a 2 to 3 percent across the board price discount for using bitcoin, that might increase user adoption.
@_date: 2014-08-21 10:36:42
Buying bitcoin isn't gambling.  It's informed speculation if you plan to hold.
@_date: 2014-02-12 00:38:51
Exchanges will definately have to become more robust and trustworthy in the future.  It would seem that the prudent thing to do is to get your bitcoins off of exchanges and into paper wallets and cold storage.
@_date: 2014-12-05 18:04:41
More infrastructure now exists to support more users.  Hearing about people getting rich with bitcoin is what will truelly drive bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2014-11-05 02:40:17

Oh yeah, and Lawsky probably had enough contact with the "Internet" and did enough reading of his own and came to conclusion that all of us did is that Bitcoin is going to change things.  He probably set up an account on coinbase in his wifes name (if he has a wife) and bought a few just to see.
@_date: 2014-12-14 06:42:35
Good insight, that is crazy to think about.  Plus coins are still being mined at a high rate. We may not see another bubble until the next halvening... or ever... maybe we stay at $350 forever and Bitcoin becomes a stable currency... or it dies into oblivion.  Bitcoin is still a gamble, but I like what it can do for money and payments.

It doesnt pay to hoard usa dollars or any fiat currency, historically.  Credit cards and preditory banking and remittance products rule the earth (where they are even available).  Bitcoin and cryptos allow you to save any amount of money for any period of time and not have that ledger corrupted by a third party.  1 btc will be 1 btc in the future. If i dont burn down the cold storage or get hacked or robbed, it will be the same amount of bitcoin as was left there.  Its good to split it up too so not everything is in one place.  If i left a future great grandson 1,000,000 cash in a safe or even in a trust or he could have .01, three bucks worth, i bet the kid takes the .01 because the dollar has historically lost 95 percent of its value and bitcoin has gone up exponentially since its inception.   40 years from now we know that the(a) blockchain will exist, but our countries and reserve banks might very well change significantly in this time.  I feel that cryptos are a new asset class but will eventually take over cash, bonds and stocks.  The markets of the future will be interconnected yet decentralized.  I think and PRAY it's going to be huge because the financial alternative is hell on Earth.  These blackhat bankers are playing a bunch of games with people's lives and we just want a money system that has fair rules for everyone.  Sure they will eventually buy in and play the same games, when their system collapses.  It will suck, but there will be a shiny, digital alternative that has historically gone up in value waiting in the wings.  Early adopters will be able to pinch off their hoard and get through tough times or they might become fabulously wealthy!

It would be cool to pay with dollars and get your change in bitcoin.  Fifty cents here and there adds up.  I have a change jar and every month I cash it in and it's about thirty bucks a month from coinstar.  Wait a second! Great idea, coinstar should add bitcoin support!

Credit cards are authorized pretty quickly, but it's not like i can accept payments with them without using a third party.

Plus you have to realize that Billions of dollars go unspent with gift cards.  Corporations make so much money for the privalege to essentially mint their own money.  In the future, you will be able to load up a physical bitcoin wallet, shaped the same size as a gift card.  A sticker over the private key.  The retailer will send money to the public key on the card, you pay the fiat, then you sweep the gift card funds to your mobile wallet or you can keep the money on that card.  easy peasy.  Anyone with a tablet can run this, the hard part is finding a company that does trusted key generation and makes these cards for dirt cheap.

Each Bubble phase that Bitcoin goes through increases the mania.  No one wants to miss the boat.  The problem is how high will it go?  Bitcoin hasn't bubbled in over a year and has been correcting.  I'm not sure how much longer it will keep going down??  BitcoinMarkets sub's charts imply that Bitcoin is undervalued at this point according to historical data, and frankly, the last year, there has been a lot of development and entrepreneurial expansion.  The Bitcoin infrastructure has been secure for six years and is only getting bigger.  Not sure what the next catalyst for the next bubble will be, but the last two bubbles we saw $30 to $240 settled at $100.  Than $100 to about $1000 and now we have settle around $350.  So using past data we could say the next bubble will go to around $3500 than settle around $1000.
To get to $100,000 we would need 4 more bubbles.
350-&gt;3500 loses ~65%
1000-&gt;10,000 "
3,500-&gt;35,000 "
10,000-&gt;100,000 "
so we have done two bubbles in two years, but how long will the next four bubbles take?  IDK, but if you look at the controlled supply at   you will see that by 2020 we will have 19,500,000 of the 21 million bitcoins already in circulation!!!  So in five years, bitcoins will be very scarce for miners!  $100,000 * ~20,000,000( for math ease) means 2 Trillion dollar Bitcoin market cap.  Gold is a 7 Trillion market cap, so within five years, Bitcoin could be worth roughly a quarter of the Gold Market according to my stats.  That's hard to believe now, but the end game for me is that I believe that Bitcoin and Crypto currencies will be used the world over and that this derivitive bubble has got to pop sometime. And if it does, Bitcoin will be a safehaven or counterbet to people who have a lot of paper assets.  Sorry if my language isn't clear, I'm still learning.

I like your analysis.  As someone who has been into Bitcoin for over a year, and been through two bubbles, I think the get rich quick aspect of bitcoin is what is truly intriguing.  To be able to put a hundred dollars into bitcoin, twenty at a time over five months than suddenly have 626 dollars worth a year later is something that poor people need.  As someone who has been poor their whole life, this shit is the truth!  Blockchain technology is so much better than evil bankers.  But yes, if bitcoin is putting a zero at the end of its tail every two years, people are going to wake up and smell the coffee and start buying some just to see what happens.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:19:16
About a month ago, I posted on my facebook wall, "So who knows about bitcoin?" One of my friends, Selko, a producer replied, "Talk to Jonathan."
I messaged Jonathan about how great I think Bitcoin is and what an amazing and revolutionary invention it is. He agreed and dropped some knowledge on Bitcoins and other Alt-coins. I browsed over to his page and holy crap!, Jonathan is Casual, the great and legendary M.C. from the Heiroglyphics crew based in Oakland. I had just opened for him with Flowalition in Denver at the Roxy, we had chatted before the show and I bought a couple of his CDs.
So it was cool, I had some ideas for doing a bitcoin song and he did too. Casual perused my beats and picked one.  We than chopped it up on business, and the artists were paid instantaneously with Bitcoin.  Casual than recorded a sick track with overdubs and everything and sent me the session files within 2 days!!! The cool thing about Bitcoin is that I was able to pay Casual before he even started working, so that he knew that I wasn't bullshitting.  I don't know how many, "The check is in the mail" stories you've heard, but for collaborations that aren't in your hometown, Bitcoin is a great way to pay or tip artists.
I called the best engineer in Denver that I know, Chris Guillot at Cherry Sound Studios, he took the vocal files that Casual provided and my beat files and mixed and mastered the whole song. I also asked for instrumental and acapella bounces, because most hiphop DJs like that kind of stuff. He was tipped in Bitcoin. I also tipped my friend in Houston that helped convert the Pro Tools files to files that we could use because the Pro Tools machine was in the shop.
Now I needed a cover, I messaged a few graphic designers, but everyone was busy, so I went to the art supply store and bought some oil paints and a canvas. My friend Peyton with Basement Lights On let me use some of her art studio space and she took the pictures. I added the Graphics and the QR code so you can tip us if you'd like. I'd like to auction or sell the painting off for charity if anyone is interested, message me at selectorsam
The cool thing about making this track is how seemless it was to either pay people in bitcoin and tip out the people who helped, but didn't know about it. Hopefully, this track will do some bitcoin propaganda and let people know that it is a way better system than fiat currency and works faster.

Thieves and Robberers exist and there is some good advice on how to cold store and obfuscate your horde.  People are already paying ransom when their computer gets a virus, I don't see this going away.  Morals or not, people have to defend their shit or it gets taken.  Hostage and Kidnapping situations are rare, but if I were Satoshi, I would kind of be a little worried that someone might find out who I am and then the deluge of identity theft, real life break ins to find paper wallets (like what happened at Gox?...) and with brain wallets, people getting tortured to cough up their money, yeah i see a dystopian future where this happens.

Being poor is a problem and i see bitcoin as a way out.  People love sound money.  Also, i think you may under estimate human greed and fear.  Sorry to be pessimistic, but say the current banking system were to collapse?  What is left?  Bitcoin and altcoins.  Yes! and gold and silver, commodities and real estate.  Every thing else is paper.  
So either people getting rich off holding bitcoin or the system collapsing is what will ultimately drive more adoption.  And bitcoin being able to scale to that size...

Haha, your right.  I guess buying bitcoin for long term holding is a sort of a gamble.  The best one I've ever made.
@_date: 2014-12-14 04:00:31
agreed.  People will either want to preserve their wealth or get rich themselves, so Bitcoin will be the place to be.  Everyone buys in during a bubble, but if you understand the Bitcoin technology, you dollar cost average buy and try to time bottoms and dips to get the most out of your money.  A year of doing this and you might have some significant coin during boring downtime correction periods.  This is where all the innovation happens when the guys who were holding make 1000% during a bubble because they were prepared.  If you buy during a bubble, you could be holding something that just lost 50% of its value and in order to unload it you either take a massive loss or you have to suck it up and wait for the next bubble.  Bitcoin will eat your shit if you havent been in the game and don't know how it works. But most people dump it if they got fucked like that and they won't come back to bitcoin until they have to...  However, it has been a year since the last bubble, who is getting impatient?  me!!!! good luck everyone, hold strong.

Noob Hunter knows what I'm talking about.  When i first heard about bitcoin it was 30 a pop.  Bubble to 240.  Stablezied at 100. Then, last nov, bubble to 1000.  Now its been stable at 350.  So my guess for next bubble is 3000-5000 range.  Lets see.
@_date: 2014-09-18 00:35:16
It's completely speculative your right, and we don't know what the future holds.  I tend to think that bitcoin is a better form of money than fiat.  There is a lot of disparity in the world, and I tend to feel that bitcoin will help even this out because central banks won't be able to manipulate the currency.  You can try to regulate bitcoin, but it is hard...  you can regulate the exchanges, but once you can pay for everything with Bitcoin, governments would be able to tax merchants, but customers much less.   
Another good point, if there is a currency collapse, it's possible that gold, silver and bitcoin won't save you, but it might help, so its worth having some.  Maybe a gun too ;-)

At this point in my life, I would consider myself average.  Once you understand that bitcoin could go up another 100x to 1000x in the next ten years or so, making it the best investment opportunity a layman could actually make in the history of the world and all you have to learn is cold storage... :-) plus the average person just wants money that doesn't lose value.

The merchants save on the fees that credit card companies charge, about three percent by using bitcoin.  Bitcoin can be exchanged for fiat immediately to mitigate the exchange risk.  If they decide to hold instead, they can go to the moon with us.

The killer app is that bitcoin is robust, sound money with an open ledger called the blockchain.  It is also an open payment network, meaning that anyone can use it.

I think in the future we are going to see more people dump wealth into bitcoin because they don't have any place else to put it that isn't regulated and taxed by a government.  You can send a billion dollars on the bitcoin network for ten cents and as long as you keep the private keys hidden...  than it is like having and old fashioned swiss bank account..  Bitcoin is even better.  No third party needed even though the Swiss have a good honest reputation for a long time.

Documentation always helps your case as well as a well thought out business plan.  Even if your business is buy Bitcoins and wait for five or ten years to see what happens to their value.   Look what Tim Draper did, he bought the last auction at $700 a pop.  Now its half that...  However, the the bank will want monthly payments so you will have to chip off your horde every month and hope that the price will go up.  It will -- astronomically, just like it has in the past.  I don't think that banks will invest in a product that will replace them, but some will to try and hang on.

I'm a buy and holder, so when I buy, I do it with 100% accuracy.  I just make sure that I have my Bitcoin secured and not left on an exchange.  If Bitcoin fails I lose.  If it succeeds I win and I don't have to cash it out, I just get to use it everywhere.
However, I would like to do analytics, but I don't have the knowledge left.  Any clues or websites that have more info.  I use a logarithmic scale to view on bitcoinwisdom.com

It means that you buy on a schedule like moleccc said.  I allocate myself a small amount that I can afford to lose every month, remember, Bitcoin is still speculative (and always will be, in a way).  I try to time what I think are the lows or small crashes and buy small batches for that time period.  We have no idea when the next bubble will come and Bitcoin could crash to new lows so you always want to have some cash to buy if something happens (news fade trading).  Except if there is a hack or failure found in bitcoin and it doesn't get fixed with the quickness.  Then you want to get out.

I think your totally right.  If someone invents a Point Of Sale bitcoin machine, they will need people to sell them and install them.  I agree completely that affiliates would be a great way to do this.  These companies would then have to be exchanges, hardware manufacturing (or license it), sales, and support.   Maybe what bitcoin needs is a paper wallet company that prints out satoshis...?

If Bitcoin keeps trending upward (dramatically and sporadically), eventually Western Union (MoneyGram) will just become an in-person Bitcoin exchange.  If WU business starts trending downward, directly because of Bitcoin, in the future, the best action would be for them to also use the Bitcoin network and exchange customers bitcoins for cash, or cash for bitcoins.  Money remittance businesses would just tack on an exchange fee for the service being everywhere. They could also print out, custom paper wallets that go in a sweet WU envelope...

Bitcoin is faster for transactions, it is strictly limited, the inflation rate is known and controlled, the protocol is fraud proof even though there is still theft, it's pseudo anonymous, it supports micro transactions.

Because it's been three long years since the previous all time high.. For those that have been in bitcoin for a while, these upcoming bull cycles is how you get rich.  Maybe only sell 5 percent of hoard, but use extra capital in Fiat wisely.  Bitcoin is helping me escape poverty just using it to save five and ten bucks every month.  It is the simplest and best performing startegy.   I was stressing buying some at 600 because it was so high... now it's doubled in mere months.  An honest recommendation is to find a way to get some before the ETF hits.  And even if it doesn't, it still useful as a way to fight poverty because there is going to be an ETF in some lucky country.  If you're broke you have nothing else to lose.

an investing forum would say no.  wall street bets would say yolo.  r/bitcoin would say yes.
my question to you is do you already have some?  If yes, than you may not need to buy more.  If no, you should have some before the bitcoin etf, because im guessing price will double once wall street money hits bitcoin.
Even if it is not approved, and it goes down, I think the price will recover in like a week.  We are too bullish right now for any long term bearishness.
so yes, now is the time to get some bitcoin.  even at the 1200 price.  maybe get eight thousand worth now, and then if there is a dip, spend the other eight to get some lowr.  but if etf is approved, you may be looking at a much higher price for your other eight.  so the best strategy to me is just yolo and buy as much as you can.  haha good luck.  this is not financial advice etc.

The overall long term trend of bitcoin is up.   So in order to maximize this trend,  long holding or hodling is called for.   It really is the best strategy for increasing your value in holding bitcoin.   Now...  If you want to trade volitity,  I would suggest the bitcoin markets subreddit.   The regular bitcoin and btc subreddit don't really have detailed technical analysis.

I liked them and considered that his model was still unbroken and that at the 700 we are at now would be considered a good buy on his chart.  wait and see i guess.  I think the best thing about his charts where the stability indicators.  usually after bitcoin had been stable for a while, a bubble would occur and they were pretty accurate about predicting that something would happen.
@_date: 2016-11-11 04:22:06
hey shut the fuck up, lets have a real discussion about bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-10 19:14:56
not all, opinions are like assholes, everyone has one.  And I am a long time bitcoin supporter.  I think segwit is great tech, but sometimes the best solution is the simplest... however, that being said.  look how forking worked out for ethereum, not so well.  so i like how bitcoin is chugging along.  however, the capacity of blocks is full.  miners would make more if the increased the block size and added segwit so they would get more fees along with block rewards.  anyways, who knows, can't wait to see what happens on the backend.
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:02:00
So if I put bitcoins on the soon to exist lightning network,  they're not my bitcoins anymore,  they are lightning network's coins...  Just saying. 
@_date: 2016-11-10 17:15:44
I disagree with your thesis.  I don't think that marijuana law change will affect bitcoin in either way.  What will increase the Bitcoin price is more adoption.  If more dispencaries and other people in the Cannabis industry start using bitcoin, that will increase the price.  Not being able to use modern banking does leave bitcoin attractive, but this change, we have not seen yet.  The Chinese seem to be initiating most price changes that we have seen recently.  good luck.

We should.  I believe that segwit should be a hardfork.  But I'm not a programmer or a economist.  segwit seems like a bunch of extra work, when all you do is change variable "1" to "4" for a block size increase.

accept that bitcoin is fungible. I will be happy to chip off the block and replenish as needed if it means that i can purchase without using my credit card.

So my solution would be to create Paper Bitcoin Wallets that look like traditional fiat.  People understand CC# and Cash.  The younger generation understands smart phones.  So Paper Bitcoins would probably bridge the gap.
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:25:44
The merchant generates an address for each person.  You pay that address every month.  Autopay!  I guess bitcoin wallets need to have a feature where they send a specific amount of money on a schedule.  But easy feature to implement.  You could add double approval, so before you send, the merchant approves that they haven't lost address.
@_date: 2015-10-23 21:29:26
Bitcoin will probably forum in the near future to a platform that will scale.  Even if the protocol doesn't scale, doesn't mean that more value can't come into bitcoin.

It works well for all payment types except for those that are bigger than the current market cap of bitcoin.  Then again, you could buy $3 Billion dollars worth of Bitcoin, than transact them. And all us bitcoin holders would love it!
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:37:50
The thing is, if bitcoin goes to the moon, it won't be little any more and regulators and state assets will be afraid of losing their power and control if bitcoin ultimately succeeds.  If bitcoin eventually takes over, paying taxes will be voluntary.  There is no way to know how many bitcoins or wallets someone has.  Or who they are sending money too.  The only way to enforce taxes or money laundering rules is on companies or actors that exist in the real material world in that countries borders.
@_date: 2015-02-27 00:31:31

Bitcoin has had about five of these so-called bubbles now.  When you know that they are happening, you can take a few profits.  But yes, Bitcoin is speculative, a speculation that people will one day want to use a superior form of money than government issued fiat.  If you are an early adopter, you will make money.
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:48:15
I am the most uninformed ever.  I had to do a google search on the term "money" just to learn that money is a medium of exchange.  I used to think it was cool to rap about because not everyone had it and it was exclusive...  Yeah, I wanna retire off of crypto.  Fuck, I want to retire off anything with good returns, I'm not that stupid.  And early adopter is 7 months ago haha.  
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:04:16

You are right, I need a good 15K 20K than.  In some ways, even though Bitcoin is speculative, I feel like having money in Bitcoin is better than cash.  I can cash out small amounts if I need it.  If I hold cash, it inflates and goes down in value in small amounts and I spend it on stupid shit.  I have been poor my whole life, so learning about money and careers is really the first step.

dogecoins have a fifth the subscribers that the bitcoin subreddit has and has surpassed litecoins in subscribers.  I would say that dogecoins are definately worth owning to see where they go.  Plus if you mine, the block reward has yet to halve for dogecoins.

haha. ok.  it'll be a big tank. POW!!! lol
@_date: 2013-09-04 06:03:48
This logic makes sense.  You could just run your CPU/Gpu/asic miner because even though it's not worth it now, if you hoard the bitcoins, it's more than likely they will go up in value long term.
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:58:46
I think if you were a business and wanted to hoard bitcoins, your idea has a lot of validity.  However, if the business has to convert to fiat, they will probably have the same price as fiat or even a higher percentage because of exchange rate fluctuation risk.
A good business owner will experiment with a lower and higher exchange rate and which increases sales and profit the most.
