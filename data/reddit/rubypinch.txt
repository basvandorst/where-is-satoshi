awareness is but a piece of code set up to automatically shitpost when an address is touched
I'm not saying that there is going to be some HFT shit going on, but more "wait, this entire bulk which was never expected to move, has started selling? what if they sell more?? I need to get out before that!" + people trying to get out before those people get out, etc
of course, its not the only thing that could happen, but once the massive bulk of unmoving money starts moving (a potential sudden increase in the coin that is going to be traded,with the same USD value of tradable coin of yesterday, == less value per coin), people are not going to be exactly cheerful and willing to hold for forever like now

to sell, they'd need a buyer, and the buyer wants the boat very unrocked (and as soon as you go onto an exchange, you are dealing with trading limits, the fact that only x% makes up the current price in terms of buy orders, etc)
a buyer could probably pay for the private key, resulting in no obvious change of hands, but once again, the new owner would not be able to use that money because a rich long-dormant address would be sounding off alarms

as with every rapidly changing investment, people arn't aiming to jump ship when the whales start selling, they're aiming to jump ship *before they start selling*, which means even a relatively small one-off transaction from a priorly-dormant whale addy could cause quite a lot of negative change in the price
of course if they did that, then the rest of their "stock" would also be affected, which is the incentive for them to not rock the boat
lol no escape

Can you tell us the criteria? and any other specifications required?
It would be nice for this to be made known /before/ even starting to work

I'm just going to upvote in hopes that more will see the BS you spin
edit:  in case it gets changed more or deleted

as noted, it can cause legal issues, and be more hassle than its worth.
additionally, isn't it more closer to donating to a third party to reward the second-part for their hard work?

 for anyone else who wanted convenient links

it doesn't scan
most QR codes are usually 99% error handling, so instead of a QR code just containing "Hi-My-Name-Is-Bob", it instead contains "Hi-My-Name-Is-Bob Hi-My-Name-Is-Bob Hi-My-Name-Is-Bob" over and over, as a result you can get rid of a good chunk of it without worries

as long as reddit has it secure enough that security features can't be [turned off at the attacker's will]( I'll be happy.

the js/html/css combo is so much of a thing, that before SSDs, motherboard/laptop manufacturers were considering embedding micro-OSes into the hardware, /just/ for browsing the web
the trifecta and JS itself is not some trivial thing to laugh at. It is inherently one of the most popular languages, with multiple high-profile companies working on it (both in making it more feature-full, and more optimized)
a future described in the DAS talk does not seem that unrealistic, considering it almost happened in actuality

by making tipping done though a bitcoin: link
it might make people tip for altruistic reasons too, instead of needing to make tipping as public as possible.

if they are planning on switching to effectively single use addresses, which they said they are, then you can track money values to specific comments easy peasy. This seems more in parity with the existing Gold system, where you can see the amount of Gold a post has earned, but not who sent it.
I think the most reasonable guess of how this system will end up, will be parity with the pre-existing rewards system, so I don't think this is an unreasonable guess of the final implementation

2fac could be optional for those that choose to have the extra protection.
also the last I looked at it, 2fac has been in the planned-features list for a while now, just hasn't been done in favor of other features (https for example)

That doesn't confirm that its legitimate
 and the phone numbers matching, along with the existing phonecalls, reasonably proves they are who they say they are, and that they are performing this campaign.
whether the money will be used properly is another thing however

When there is any disagreement, I can't tell is this is r/conspiracy or r/bitcoin
Other than that, multi-device/1-wallet is something I would like, have not seen much to that end though (even though I know it can be done)

yep! just go to an exchange, buy some coin, roll a die, if it comes up 1, then the exchange locks your account and gives you radio silence.

if I was to be sold on a killer feature...
an option for the host to force the use of a client-selected anonymity network or VPN (in other words, block everything but Tor and VPN traffic), to keep the host safer.
obviously those hosts will need to offer a lower price to warrant the extra effort for the client, but (imo) it will increase adoption amongst hosts if they can feel safe when they host

I've seen better AMAs from him on any other site except reddit, because so many dislike him here for such silly reasons

don't get into the attitude of an irresponsible startup. you are a company handling money, so have the attitude of a money handler first and foremost.

man, why not just use any normal file host? why github, a source-code host?
it makes it harder to find source-available projects when people do stuff like that
