I have had police seize all my cash,my vehicles, my step daughters cash, my cell phones, my bank accounts, the one thing they could not take is my $30,000 worth of Bitcoin\Litecoins. That saved my life and able for me to get back on my feet and continue life.......so thank you Bitcoin I salute you!

I like your thinking, I live in Vancouver B.C and the Chinese are buying all our houses right now, they have put every house on b.c realtor websites to a Chinese website and they are getting into bidding wars over places they haven't even seen just to get their money out of their country. I think they will soon re direct their money into Bitcoin causing it to moon.
2.5 million dollar crack shack house that China person has bought in Vancouver in a bidding war.......

More like miners are not selling right now until Bitcoin halves and sells into the sheeple of buyers
@_date: 2016-04-27 03:34:09
Did you just figure that out? You must feel special for trying to inform people this. What he's trying to say is we are going to moon again.
......down vote me if you agree.

I think you should lead by example and sell your Bitcoins at a lower price. I love how people try and attack him for being a successful business man who made his riches by buying and selling property's and then self funded his campaign to get the nomination. Hillary takes campaign contributions from country's in the Middle East that have laws that being gay is punishable by death.
