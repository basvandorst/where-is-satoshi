Miners do have a voice in this, but their voice is not all-powerful.  Miners follow the money.  They don't decide the value, they only work to acquire it.
A system for miners to report which version they support is planned, but they could be making false statements.  Therefore that data is only marginally useful.

I will on-chain funds to dozens of spokes and have the funds tied up there, then on-chain juggle the funds around when a certain spoke balance gets low?  I would rather have all my funds in a single convenient place rather than have accounts on dozens of different spokes depending on which restaurant I want to eat at on any given evening.   I'm picturing something like, oh i don't know, a Bitcoin wallet.  Must be nice to be so rich you can have funds just sitting out there on dozens of different Lightning Channel spokes on the off-chance you feel like buying goods from the merchants each spoke is connected to.

I currently can transfer alright, but the [writing is on the wall](  As we approach Network Capacity (assuming you don't use Bitcoin as just a get-rich scheme) isn't it the responsible thing to do to curtail adoption?  "Captain, I'm givin' her all she got, she can't give no more."
My business has been using Bitcoin for 100% of internal and external payments for almost 2 years.  My employees who fear bitcoin's volatility need to a) be able to receive the pay in a timely manner, and b) be able to transfer those coins to an Exchange in a timely manner.   In fact, which bitcoin business plans (Blockstream, of course, excepted) are not negatively impacted if transactions submitted to the network result in over-capacity?

In theory all they have to do is upgrade bitcoind and they are good to go.  The first time some miner somewhere mines a 1MB+ block, miners have to decide to apply their precious hashes to work off of that block or the previous one.  While there will be some ideological miners, in theory they should apply their mining resources to whichever branch they perceive to be the most valuable to everybody else.  Hopefully that choice will be a no-brainer to everyone by the time we get to that point, but there are no guarantees.

Chun Wang of F2pool [gave this workaround](


the previous block's header, in this case, the network would see many
more transaction-less blocks.
If I read this correctly, as they are downloading the large new block they start work on a transaction-less block.  When the new block is completely downloaded and reconciled with their mempool, they can add transactions to block they are currently working on.  This seems to make sense for every miner to do even under the tiny block regime.

If usage patterns remain the same, the only reason for 20MB blocks is if there are 20 times more users.

The problem is there is no customer defined design requirements document for Bitcoin.  
For instance, one project I worked on the USAF defined a requirement that the trajectory of 500 incoming MIRVs needed to be detected and communicated within 5 seconds.  
**Who sets the design requirements for Bitcoin?**  I've never worked on project where the lowly developers were in charge of defining and maintaining the requirements.  
Is Bitcoin's design such that a block must be communicated in less than 100 seconds on a 1Mbit up connection?  Who gets to set that design requirement for everybody?
@_date: 2015-06-07 05:15:05

In the long term this can become a problem.  With 1.3 million coins created out of thin air this year, close 1 million next year and 650,000 in 2017 this is not as pressing an issue as bitcoin running at overcapacity.  I don't believe overcapacity while millions of coins are being created will lead to bitcoin being a successful experiment.
I'm not willing to invest in bitcoin on the long shot fees inside 1 MB blocks will be enough to provide security in the long term.  A large number of transactions paying modest fees (but a large sum in the aggregate) is the more likely outcome.

That is a risk worth taking for my vision of what Bitcoin should be.  Others have a different vision of what Bitcoin should be, which is fine.  I can't force you to use my version and you can't force me to use yours.  
But we can force everybody to make a decision about what bitcoin should be through a fork.
I am not willing to use the tiny block vision for much longer.  Either side can capitulate at any point, if not the market will decide.

Many predict that fees will not be enough to sustain mining when the block reward vanishes.  I believe this is especially acute with 1 MB blocks.  Consumers will flock to cheaper methods while hoarders will hold a increasingly insecure asset as miners shut down.  A very large number of small and competitive transaction fees may or may not be able to sustain mining.  
I think we are both alluding to the idea that the goal is whatever is best for humanity.  That doesn't have to be Bitcoin but Bitcoin's ability to compete can help.

IP/server tracking is nowhere in the protocol, and easy to spoof.  It is up to the miners to choose what to put in the blocks they produce.  You could take some home baked cookies around to the miners and ask, pretty please, could y'all start black listing addresses.
@_date: 2015-12-14 16:31:22
Bitcoin's security model (after this hyper-inflationary period subsides) is based on transactions fees.  A change to have other actors in the Bitcoin ecosystem besides miners capturing transfer fees or moving transactions off-chain could be construed as decreasing Bitcoin's security.  At least the opposite cannot be true:  Moving transaction volume off chain increases blockchain security against hostile miner attack.

XT nodes simply discard whatever small blocks come along as invalid according to the protocol they are running.  There's nothing to sync to after 41999 until a valid 1MB+ block comes along.

Correct.  Once you write to either of the blockchains after the fork you can run into problems.  But a single transaction will not jump between forks.  It will either be self-contained on one fork or the other or both.  (wow. that does sound confusing).     Most scenarios predict that the winning fork is very quickly decided by market or other forces.
@_date: 2015-06-15 07:15:31
From what I understand from our esteemed leaderz, bitcoin is not suppozed to be part of the consumer/merchant equation.  THere's this non-existent sidechain stuff that is suppozed to perform that job.  You'll have to wait to see what benefits are provided by the sidechain stuff.

Certainly, not every human transaction could possibly be conducted on the blockchain... given current technology.  But we can do a hell of a lot better than 3 TPS. Even if the Lightning Network goes into production and every merchant, user, and exchange switches over to it, their security model requires blocks to be able to be significantly larger than 1MB and each channel creation, closure and "top-up" is a blockchain event.

Bitcoin doesn't scale.  If by world citizens you mean 1 in 20,000, alright.  Otherwise your argument is invalid.  It's just a digital form of gold, whoopdie doo.  Unlike gold, bitcoin forever needs massive amounts of electricity thrown at it or the value goes to 0.
@_date: 2015-06-02 00:04:42
I've come to the same conclusions.  If you believe that 1 MB blocks will kill Bitcoin and you also believe that the limit is going to remain in place, the only logical thing to do is sell bitcoin for the best price you think you can get.  
We all have to continuously judge which outcome is most likely and act accordingly with our capital.  
If you think 1 MB blocks would save Bitcoin and the status quo will remain, I suppose you would consider buying more if the price were right.

That is not the point/goal/purpose of decentralization.  That is the implementation.  Or rather, distributing points of control and failure just for the heck of it serves no real purpose.
We can go overboard on decentralization, like in my example, 25% of the worlds CPU clock cycles chugging away verifying the blockchain.  
We don't know how much decentralization is needed to preserve the blockchain.  It is imperative to err on the side of safety.  But we must also acknowledge every carbon unit/clock cycle/transmitted packet that is above what is required could have been used in some other way to benefit humanity.

For ideological reasons, I won't be sticking with status quo Bitcoin.  I consider 1MB blocks too centralized and elitist for what is coming.  I'm prepared to go out with a bang.  Are you?  Love it or leave it, you are not forced to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 03:51:00
A decade from now the inflation reward from each block will be 3.125 bitcoins.  I'm not at all sure transaction fees will be able to pick up the slack and provide for security, especially with 1 MB blocks.
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:59:05
The myopic views of the github-commit-allowed dudes regarding block limit already caused me to sell a butt load.  I'm ready and willing to buy back in for a pump'n'dump if the true believers wake the fuck up.  Just don't make me dig into my cold storage to sell that, too.  God, I hope there is enough room in blocks when it comes to that.  Fucking everybody wanting to cash out but there is no fucking room in blocks.  Makes sense if you think about it.......

Many predict that fees will not be enough to sustain mining when the block reward vanishes.  I believe this is especially acute with 1 MB blocks.  Consumers will flock to cheaper methods while hoarders will hold a increasingly insecure asset as miners shut down.  A very large number of small and competitive transaction fees may or may not be able to sustain mining.  
I think we are both alluding to the idea that the goal is whatever is best for humanity.  That doesn't have to be Bitcoin but Bitcoin's ability to compete can help.

The ultimate goal of Decentralization is to preserve the integrity of the blockchain.  I can't imagine a more expensive and wasteful means to keep a set of data intact.  But neither can I imagine a more corruption-resistant means.
If in 100 years we all agree that the blockchain has remained pristine in its integrity then our decentralization experiment will have been a raging success no matter if we had 100 nodes or 7 billion.
While it is fun to hypothesize about the future, I think we can all agree up to this point Bitcoin's blockchain has thus far remained intact.  So has Litecoin's.  Litecoin has managed the same results phenomenally more efficiently.
If 25% of the world's computation power went towards verifying the Bitcoin blockchain I think we would all agree that we are doing it wrong.
I don't see Bitcoin succeeding with 1 MB blocks.  I strongly believe the end goal of decentralization will still be realized if we increase the block size limit within reason.  I fear my capital is at risk on a soon-to-be failed experiment while the status quo is at the helm of this ship.  I sell and feel it would be inappropriate to recommend Bitcoin to others if I don't believe in it myself.

It is not at all clear to me that a 20x is dangerous. I do not believe decentralization will be degraded in a significant manner.

Sure, but the only way you can stop me buying coffee with bitcoin is if we are both paying so goddamn much in fees that I run screaming to another payment method and you knuckle on with the fees you are willing to pay.  That other payment method is more useful to me.  Value is calculated from usefulness and scarcity.  Higher fees makes bitcoin less valuable.  This is why I am selling bitcoin.

There has been a general lamentation about the declining number of nodes as that relates to decreased decentralization.

Ignoring what people believe, objectively would decentralization be improving?

60% of the hashrate could choose to drop out or attack.  We should at least take some time to consider their views no matter if that hashrate is located in Madagascar, the Faroe Islands, or China.
Many miners are located in China because electricity is cheap there.  It also fits in with being an export economy in general: produce bitcoins and export them to the west, if profitable, like so many other products.

Lightning network uses a new, different and exotic trust and security model.  Lightning network is in pre-pre-pre-beta. Each channel you create, close, or top-up requires blockchain activity, anyways.  Transactions within a Lightning Network channel do not pay blockchain transaction fees and therefore do not contribute to the security of the bitcoin network.

Right now each train trip is paid for by the city (the block reward) and passengers enjoy a safe journey practically for free. The city will gradually subsidize each trip less and less.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

Miners are creating 1.3 million bitcoins this year but let's setup a fee market on top of that based on a resource of inelastic supply.  Nodes receive nothing from fees. In theory fees paid from users to miners decrease the load on nodes. *But a fee market only functions when the blocks are full anyways.*  Transactions on the wire or on disk look virtually identical if they are for a cup of coffee or mega-bank A paying mega-bank B.  You imply that the bank transactions stored on your disk are superior to coffee transactions even though you are party to neither side of the transaction.  Why do you think that way?

I kinda doubt the issuance schedule will be altered for Bitcoin.  
In less than 10 years 95% of all bitcoins will have already done been mined.  Sure, all is fine now while 1.3 million coins are released per year but I have concerns about the security of the network when the coinbase starts off at 3.125 bitcoins.  Monero's issuance schedule doesn't slope off as bad as Bitcoin's.

Basically what I see a bubble in security.  While the tokens are generated in significant numbers, miners have an incentive to secure the network.

When most of Bitcoin's transaction volume is off chain, how will the miners get paid?

Where does Bitcoin's value come from?  
Doesn't it come from the merchants, exchanges and particularly the users?
Bitcoin is built on the concept that miners try to maximize profit.  
If miners do not follow merchants, exchangers and  users then can't we assume miners are actually acting ideologically and illogically?
If so, I'm more than willing to get into a little scorched earth with you on my way out.  I am a user, I am allowed to act ideologically.  Most of the threats from the 1 MB side after losing such a battle is that they'll turn off their node.  I am willing to do more than just that.

Correct me if I'm wrong here but when the highly inflationary era is over in less than 10 years, aren't fees from on-chain transactions the primary source of funds used to secure the blockchain?  If most transactions are off-chain who is going to pay to secure the main chain?

I would have preferred that block reward eventually degraded to 0.1 BTC per block and stayed there.  But it didn't start off that way and it and won't end up that way.  
 Unfortunately, I don't see the long-term mined security of the blockchain being sustainable by fees alone.

That's up to "we the people."  After the massively inflationary period is over, we're going need those fees to pay for the security of the network, unless we come up with a better way to do it.  It seems tiny blockers are betting the horse that fees are going to be so goddamn expensive that security will be sufficient.  Larger blocks, on the other hand, allows for the same amount of total income from fees to secure the network but cost borne by each sender would be be lower.

What another node does makes no difference to your node.  Your node doesn't trust any other node.  Your node validates every transaction in every block no matter how many other nodes there are.
@_date: 2015-06-28 12:35:30


Source?  Surely you aren't talking about about fiat exchange transactions such as occurs on MtGox and Bitfinex?
Lightning Transactions only provide blockchain security through fees when a channel is established, closes, or reorganizes.  Every micro-transaction style transaction on LN that could have been on the blockchain decreases security from loss of fees.  LN consumes block space establishing a channel, closing it or reoganizing it so you'll only get very modest improvement from LN.  LN's security model requires a rather large amount of available blockspace as per your example: a centralized hub goes offline.   No merchant accepts LN payments so I'll have to smoke a bowl of weed before getting too much further into all these hypotheticals.

This work should have been done years ago, not while block overload is staring us in the face (see: growth in [Transactions per day]( graph).  
Decentralization is a means to an end, not the end itself.  If usage patterns remain the same, the only reason blocks become larger is if more people are using bitcoin, adding to Bitcoin's network effect and providing resources to preserve and increase decentralization. What is the magic number for the best node count for "decentralization" and how do you come up with that number?  I don't trust the node you and others run, I only trust my own node.  How does 1,000,000 nodes make any difference to me compared with, say, 1,000 nodes?  Other nodes only serve as a relay to me, they don't need to store or validate the blockchain because I've never trusted them anyways.  With larger blocks, Bitcoin's ledger will remain firmly intact, i.e., the only reason to waste such incredible amounts of resources on decentralization in the first place.  
Bitcoin has worked fairly well with 1 MB blocks thus far.  Technology in the wider world has improved and it is past time Bitcoin reflects those advances in bandwidth, storage and processing speed.

Not at all,  The miner can put whatever transactions he wants into the block he mines himself.  He could even add crazy large fees on each transaction he is sending back to himself, too.  Guess where all those fees end up?  Right back in his pocket.
@_date: 2015-06-18 01:12:03
Hoarding is fine in an era of high inflation. Both spenders and hoarders benefit from the security paid for by the block subsidy.  When the block reward decreases significantly, security is paid for by spenders (transaction fees).  Without security there is no value. Hoarders stake their hopes on preserving value on other people transacting in bitcoin.

Miners are creating 1.3 million bitcoins this year but let's setup a fee market on top of that based on a resource of inelastic supply.  Nodes receive nothing from fees. In theory fees paid from users to miners decrease the load on nodes. *But a fee market only functions when the blocks are full anyways.*  Transactions on the wire or on disk look virtually identical if they are for a cup of coffee or mega-bank A paying mega-bank B.  You imply that the bank transactions stored on your disk are superior to coffee transactions even though you are party to neither side of the transaction.  Why do you think that way?

Exactly how many nodes are the correct number, Mr. scientifically validatable Dude?  I don't trust anybody elses node, the only one that matters is my own.
Assuming usage patterns remain the same, the only reason we'd have 8MB blocks if we have 8x more users.  The currently low ratio of node operators to bitcoin users could fall a further 75% and we'd have twice as many nodes on the network than we do now.  
1 MB blocks become a self-fulfilling prophecy. No, we won't run into major transaction backlogs because very few people will use bitcoin.  The fees will remain low and miners will drop off as the block subsidy degrades.  Bitcoin dies with a whimper.  Thanks a lot, Board of Central Core Devs Policy Banksters.

Are you arguing for 100 KB blocks?  Cheaper, right?  Or are those blocks "too cold", 8 MB blocks "too hot", 1 MB blocks "just right?"  
Ramping up fees charged to users and handing them over to miners is a devious and roundabout way to save voluntary node operators a portion of their bandwidth bill.  Especially if the fees given to miners are greater than the savings node operators enjoy at users' expense.  
Every transaction inside a payment channel doesn't pay miner's fees and therefore doesn't contribute to the security of the network. However, I do see how payment channels will be useful for micro-transactions.   
@_date: 2015-06-01 13:59:39

Ok, I guess an income of 1.3 million bitcoins is not enough.  Must also sell block space to the highest bidder.  If there is a fee market and still demand for space pushes up to 20 MB per block, then and only then nodes will get some balls and you won't worry about decentralization?

Every tiniest amount of bitcoin is accounted for publicly with every copy of the blockchain.  The trick is associating the balance on a particular bitcoin address with a specific account (a known identity).  There is no way built into the protocol to do that since addresses can be created anonymously anywhere anytime.

This mantra of a fee-market...  Why?   So as to pay for security of the blockchain?   Because 1.3 million bitcoins created out of thin air and handed to the miners are not enough to secure the blockchain in 2015?  Even in 2016 close to 1 million bitcoins will be inflated into existence.  
In the long run, yes, we will need higher fees AND/OR more transactions paying modest fees. And it will be interesting transitioning to that environment.  But for the next few years, at least, it is putting cart before the horse.

Theoretically BTC miners should burn as much per year as that year's bitcoin inflation + fees (while squeaking out a slim profit).  Burning more per year than the value of the  bitcoin that is produced means losing money (would be better off just buying rather than mining).

It is the price to be paid for decentralization.  If the size of the blockchain is an issue, you can use a thin-client such as Multibit or Electrum.  
For spending bitcoins, a fully verifying client is not too important.  My phone has a bitcoin wallet but no blockchain and I've never had any problems spending bitcoins from it.  For receiving bitcoins it becomes more of an issue.

Bitcoin is high-risk (with potential for high reward).  Therefore, do not invest what you can't afford to lose.  I recommend spacing out whatever purchases you do decide to make over time.

First off, you won't mistype an address.  There is a checksum built-in that protects against this.
Secondly, if you want charge back features go ahead and keep using PayPal/Visa/Your bank.  Since Bitcoin is decentralized with a fair bit of anonymity, who exactly is going to  decide to authorize or disallow a charge back?

On the other hand, I'm not sure industrial strength NY exchanges will exist without regulations.  A year from now I would not be surprised if NY exchanges represent the bulk of exchange volume and that many will believe they are responsible for the incredible increase in the Bitcoin price...

Basic math:  How much does electricity cost you? How much of the network do you represent.  From there you can see how much bitcoin you expect to earn, how much it is currently worth and how much you'll spend on electricity.  In most cases you'll be paying more for electricity than you earn in bitcoin, better to just buy bitcoin from circle.com or somewhere.

Not sure but I think they often have private arrangements to sell incoming bitcoin to specific buyers such as Second Market/BIT.  Coinbase, you know, also sells bitcoin to individuals.  To a certain extent they can match incoming bitcoins with outgoing.  When incoming are in greater supply than demand, they probably do sell on exchanges such as Bitstamp.

Lightweight wallets such as Electrum and Multibit are an option for a desktop client that does not require the full blockchain.
Probably 3 things are holding Bitcoin back. Volatility, how technically complicated it is for most people, and security.  
There are anecdotal stories of funds being stolen from Blockchain and Coinbase wallets, perhaps through weak passwords or phishing.
If you store your coins at Coinbase, you completely entrust those coins to their management.

Mining is Bitcoin's most audacious experiment.  It has never been tried before on this level and has only proven to work "so far."  How the uncertainties surrounding mining factor into a person's risk profile of Bitcoin is a rather personal conundrum but it should be one of the big unknowns of such a risk profile.

There are 2 types of inflation. Price inflation and money supply inflation.  Most people think about price inflation.  When prices are increasing, people who have money stuffed in mattresses might be cajoled into pulling it out and spending it into the economy (either on goods, equities or interest paying bank deposits).  Nowadays interest rates have been hammered so low people are looking for yields in higher risk areas, which can lead to malinvestment.  
In actual fact, with 25 freshly minted coins being produced every block, bitcoin has experienced about 11% money supply inflation this year and price inflation has been even worse.

I'm not sure these regs even apply to my "bitcoin business":


Used by whom?  Is an IOU typed out in an email a Virtual Currency?  If I transfer Sally's promise to pay her portion of last Thursday's dinner over to Joe, does that require a BitLicense?  
Take the case of Testnet Bitcoins: Do these regulations apply to them?  Why or why not?


Bitcoins never leave the blockchain.  I receive nothing but periodic block message updates along with everybody else.  I have no control over what is in those block messages.  It seems like it is illegal to communicate over any channel (smoke signals, CB radio) to anybody in the State of New York my Receiving Bitcoin Address without first jumping through a bunch of hoops.  I send blockchain update messages in the form of transactions which I sign with a number and it is up to others to verify the message according to their own set of rules.

That bitcoin is not controlled by a government or central bank is the main selling point for me.  The supply of the currency is strictly set.  The only unknown is the demand for it, which dictates its price.  The end goal is for bitcoin to find its global demand saturation point where volatility decreases down to nothing. At that point the "last ones in" should be able to retain the same purchasing power in Bitcoin as they do in fiat.

@_date: 2014-10-08 05:02:17
It is a difficult issue.  You are saying that Bitcoin should limit itself to being 250 times smaller than Visa **by design**.  Concurrently, if bitcoin becomes popular, real estate (getting included in a block) will go to the highest bidders and can get very expensive.
You also predict there will be alternatives to bitcoin at some point. 
Maybe it is time to get merchants to switch to Ripple now, I want to be able to purchase goods and services with the reliability of current alternatives (CCs) without having to worry if America is awake or not.

Bitcoin acts as a distributed ledger of ownership.  The "first app" has been a currency system.  Another comes to my mind: Colored Coins.  Slice a bitcoin up into many pieces, each of which represent a stock share in a corporation.  These stocks can transfer between individuals without a middleman.  Dividends can be paid directly to the owning addresses without a middle man.  A trusted bank can build a gold-backed currency inside a single bitcoin while utilizing the bitcoin protocal and mining network.
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:38:41
Yeah, Satoshi should have just pre-mined all the coins before the network even got started.  I'm sure the hash power backing our transactions would still be where it is at today and each bitcoin would be worth more.  /s

Concentration of the currency among "whales" is the only issue you raised that I'm concerned about.  The theory goes: along the way to world currency status these whales will find a point they'll be content enough to exchange a good portion of their holdings.
Anyways, if the global marketplace wants a global currency, it will get one.  If not, oh well.  And by "global marketplace" I mean all of us individually.  If you want to continue using PayPal, Citibank and Federal Reserve Notes, that's your prerogative, too.

If a large amount of users decrease their total bitcoin holdings by spending them and not replenishing, it is actually those users that are decreasing the demand and increasing the supply of bitcoin.  
Corporations haven't been hodlers in the first place... selling in the future what they currently don't own shouldn't make much of a different.

Oh, I don't know about that.  They use Coinbase for the direct Bitcoin network interaction.  Mainly it was just integrating the Coinbase API into their existing database and inventory control system which they claimed to have accomplished quickly. Overstock already had coders on salary so it came down to the opportunity cost of those coders doing something else with their time.  
Edit: They've also said that time and money spent on handling fraud for BTC transactions is much less than traditional payments (charge backs, stolen CCs)

It is interesting.  I'm a goldbug myself.  Rather I am deep into "hard money".  I find it curious that humans have for so long and up to today chosen Gold as a store of value. Well, there it is.  The markets never lie.  Gold is risky, too, like everything else. The amount of gold atoms available in the Universe is nearly boundless.  The scarcity is dictated by our access to tech, energy, and time.  So, markets markets markets. I don't subscribe to the "intrinsic value" point-of-view.  Those words shouldn't be placed next to each other.  I replace those words with "industrial demand at this current point in time."

It acts as a counterpoint to fiat printing, giving end users a choice of which type of money they wish to use.  This puts Bitcoin in the same realm as gold (governments can't print gold... yet :).  
Krugmanists often spout out that a deflationary currency is "bad" for society.  To which I answer: Y'all go ahead and use a depreciating currency "for the greater good" but I will excercise my right to use a currency of my choice.
Truth is we don't know what would happen if the world adopted deflationary Bitcoin and only have previous gold standard eras as reference (which weren't necessarily terrible times for development).

Fairly thorough, but nothing ground breaking.  
1) Miners do not cause inflation, supply inflation is hard coded in the protocol no matter if there are billions of miners or just 1.  
2) If I were a miner and bitcoin were valued way above my production cost, wouldn't I also be just as tempted to cash out?
3) If bitcoin blows out its all time high and stabilizes up there, where is the weak link in your thesis: "bitcoin will continue its downward slide"?

Dilution of bitcoin supply through the block reward is not paid by the bitcoins transferring inside a block.  It is shared by every bitcoin in existence.

Yes, your computer will be crunching numbers attempting to solve the next block, which is what "mining" is.  The chances of you actually solving a block are next to zero but not actually zero.  Currently, worldwide, about 54,642,295 Gigahash per second are being thrown at mining.

In a competitive, transparent, rational market miners would consume electricity equal to the value of the bitcoins created.  I believe many miners have found ways to get "free" electricity (i.e., offloading that cost onto corporations/society) and I believe more electricity is consumed these days than the value of coins created.

Rule 11: For each input, if the referenced output transaction is coinbase (i.e. only 1 input, with hash=0, n=-1), it must have at least COINBASE_MATURITY (100) confirmations; else reject this transaction

Oh, I'm sorry, what the hell are you talking about? Do you honestly believe humans are 100% in agreement about \_anything_, let alone best practices for encrypting and decrypting private keys?  
In my version of Bitcoin-QT, for example, the developers decided to use a passphrase, not mnemonics. It is open source, though, so you could patch in mnemonics support (but with your "100% agreement" phrase I'd suggest you hire somebody to do it for you).  
It comes down to trade-offs between convenience and entropy.  Convenience being a subjective judgement, entropy not so much.

Good to see BitPay diversifying since Lawsky pretty much killed bitcoin payment processors in the U.S.  BitPay/Coinbase, in order to present or process an Invoice to a potential payer, will require that payer to log into an account that is somehow verified for physical address.  While some may continue using such payment processors, I bet the market will coalesce around less restrictive options.

Bitcoin Wallet by Andreas Schildbach  
  
is an SPV wallet based on BitcoinJ  (same engine as MultiBit).
A "light" node (meaning it doesn't verify transactions against the blockchain) is only good for passing unverified data around.  Passing unverified data around is not much needed at this point in time and it could chew up your data plan in no time.

Transactions usually propagate across the network in a second or two.  Next time you pay through BitPay, for example, use a stopwatch and confirm that for yourself.
Blocks are a measure of how much computing power was put in towards making a transaction irreversible.  Increasing the frequency of blocks does not change the aggregate amount of computing power applied.  Increasing the frequency of blocks would lead to more reorganizations of the blockchain, discouraging mining in general.  It would also increase the size of the blockchain (16x more block headers) and the amount of network traffic.

Don't miss the train!
There is a Bitcoin convention in China on May 10th followed by a PBOC gathering May 14th and 15th.  If nothing crazy happens during these events I expect the BTC exchange rate to shoot up.  If it does go up, it can happen rather quickly.
@_date: 2014-10-26 23:16:40
If the block size doesn't increase, Bitcoin will forever be limited to being 250 times smaller than Visa (in terms of number of transactions).  If people want their transactions actually processed, they will have to compete against each other to get them included in blocks and that will get very expensive.  
But yeah, keeping 1 live copy and a couple backups of the ledger in a centralized system is way cheaper than transmitting it to an unlimited number of decentralized nodes.

Not real knowledgeable but it seems Bitcoin and Ripple try to solve slightly different problems.  Seems ripples move around like bitcoin does but the actual units don't have much value themselves but are somehow tied to another asset.  I'm not sure how decentralized that is or how the mining network works.  I see how they could compliment each other for sure.
This seems like it would be better in but meh, every month or two doesn't hurt to have a discussion about ripple.

Bitcoin is psuedo-annonymous.  You'd have to know which addresses the stores are using (most of them use addresses only 1 time).  Then you could use blockchain.info to track or your own copy of the blockchain.

Yer both wrong.  "Useful" is always relative to a specific entity.  In my house an ounce of gold has the same usefulness as a folded up piece of paper: I can place it under the leg of a wobbly chair.  On the other hand, I have found bitcoin to be useful in exchange for goods and services from the comfort of that same chair.
So, utility is always relative and only indirectly touches on the issue at hand: Store of Value.

Currently less than 0.1% of the population owns any bitcoin.  I think 0.2% is doable.  But reaching 1% is just Koo Koo crazy talk.
Yes, supply is increasing but eventually the rate will eventually decrease and the total supply is capped at 21 million bitcoins (or about 0.003 per human).

Nah, they don't really serve any purpose besides the act of solving them.  This is called [Proof of Work]( one of the cornerstones of the Bitcoin system.  They are hard to solve but easy to verify. The difficulty in solving them dynamically adjusts to how many miners are working at it.  If needed, the software can ratchet up so that it would probably take all the energy in the universe to solve the next target equation.

Remittances, where Bob puts fiat in and Alice pulls fiat out, would be net neutral for whichever pass through currency is involved.  
A higher price of Bitcoin will come from more hoarders.  If other cryptocurrencies develop deeper liquidity, they may become attractive to investors at the expense of Bitcoin...  If investors come to believe they'll be able to exchange altcoins for better value at a later date.  I don't see any indication of that happening presently.

It runs on MasterCoin, which uses the Bitcoin protocol.  Just because Bitcoin is here doesn't mean all other asset classes (USD, gold, oil, real estate, etc) go away.  Bitcoin, in its Colored Coin role, is a pretty snazzy way to transfer asset rights between parties. These types of developments are expected and shows progress is being made in the Bitcoin realm.  If BTC the currency is stage 1.0, the market will decide which of these 2.0 applications are useful and desired.

What's the purpose of running a full node?  To verify transactions against the blockchain.  It would seem that requesting previous blocks over and over again from your peers each time you see a new transaction just explodes the already high bandwidth requirements.

Well, the strip on a credit card contains some private information that is pulled at each store you use it.  Did you hear about the Target hack where millions of cards where compromised.  Bitcoin uses a different paradigm where the funds are sent in a more sterile manner.
For many consumers having a bank account (filling out forms), having good credit and having the government watching over your shoulder is not an issue.  Bitcoin tries to be an option for consumers that do have these issues.
Bitcoin is NOT government issued fiat.  It is very frickin' far away from that and, ideologically, one of the main reasons I personally want to use it.

Coinbase did an AMA and said that about 2/3 of their volume is handled internally, people buying coins from them are matched with others selling coins to them.  For that other 1/3 of their volume they reach out to other sources/exchanges.  Some speculated that when Coinbase is a net buyer they scoop up coins from BitPay.

I believe the situation is Coinbase keeps their hot wallet super-starved (as a security precaution).  At any rate, when you request an external bitcoin payment they often construct and broadcast a transaction using change that is 3, 4, even 5 hops from even being confirmed yet.  Lame.  There is nothing you can do but let watch each hop eventually confirm, in the meantime the time window for your payment closes and you have to open a support ticket with the destination.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:57:11
Yeah, well we'll see.  This has always been the case, nothing has changed in that regard.  Bitcoin thrusts itself into the no-holds barred ring of the free market with all of this known.
Bitcoin is open source so that we can all take a look at it and come to our own conclusions about the trustfullness and security.  A side affect is that anybody can take the code and start up their own mining network.  So be it.
It has always been a question of supply and demand.  You argue that demand will decrease to zero.  We'll see about that in the future.

You are free to use a different payment method besides bitcoin.  If you are using bitcoin you must play by the rules.  The miners who process transactions receive your fee for the work they do.  The fee has [recently decreased]( to 0.00001 BTC per transaction but your wallet software (which you didn't specify) might not have updated yet.

I use bitcoin as both an investment and payment system.  Main selling points **for me** are that governments can't arbitrarily print it, it provides what I believe to be better privacy than traditional methods, nobody can block my payments sent or received, and that it is quick and easy to use.


[Blockchain.info charts]( has some interesting data on this.  Bitcoin has been averaging over 80k transactions per day for a while.

Pretty much, yes.  I hear from goldbugs that Bitcoin is useless in a grid-down, internet-off zombie apocolypse.  Which is true.  "Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet" which implies that the health of the internet is a precurser to the health of Bitcoin.  This all gets factored into your risk profile of bitcoin as a bitcoin owner.
@_date: 2014-07-17 08:11:56
You and I, basically.  If I want or need to cash out I think I can find BTC buyers more easily than flavor-of-the-monthCoin. I think there are more opportunities to spend BTC than other coins and I think the mining network is stronger and more secure. I think most discerning investors see the same things I do and choose BTC as well.  It could change and another coin could take over but there would have to be  a strong reason in order to overcome the items I've mentioned.

The amount of fresh bitcoins that can be generated through mining is limited to 21 million.  The amount of bitcoins that can be gained from fees is infinite.   
The fresh bitcoins rewarded for mining dwindles off over time.  It is hoped either the number of transactions generating fees increases over time (but currently capped at about 3.5k transactions per block), the average fee amount increases or the value of bitcoin (and associated fees) increases.  
We don't really know with certainty which, if any, of the above shall happen.

A disaster happens on the network if and only if it becomes victim to an attack. The hashrate can drop and if it is not attacked, no biggie.
Who knows what will happen between now and then.  At least we all know it is coming and can plan for it.  If the price doubles and the hashrate stays constant, mining will be exactly as profitable in fiat terms as it is now.

Not just GHash.  If Miners want to solo-mine, they can already do that now.  But they don't want to do that, they want to mine in a pool.  Miners with "low" hash rate may never find a block on their own, but if they join a pool they receive a slow trickle of funds if one of their peers finds at least 1 block.

I'd be curious to see the language used.  Exactly what is Bitcoin?  They aren't going to make 256 bit numbers illegal (private keys).  They won't make SHA-256 illegal. Governments do not make things illegal, they make human behaviors illegal.  So, they could say it is illegal for an update in a global distributed ledger to correspond to a seller handing over goods or services to a buyer.  But I would assume barter would remain legal and exchanging chickens for the same goods and services would still remain legal.

gorgonsignal, do you know the purpose of confirmations, what they measure?  They measure how much computational power has gone into making a transaction final.  Speeding up the block time in no way changes the amount of computational power that has been applied.  To get an equivalent assurance with dogecoin as one gets with bitcoin would require much more time because the hash rate is much lower.
@_date: 2014-10-12 05:48:09

Every smallest fraction of a bitcoin sits at some bitcoin address.  A central assumption of bitcoin is that if the private key to that address is lost, it will not be able to be recreated using all the computational power available to mankind at this point in time.

As an investor it really comes down to which will hold value or increase in value.  I just don't think in the long run any of the altcoins will compared to bitcoin.  The things I look at are mining strength (security), merchant acceptance (usability) and market cap (liquidity). I think I will more easily find buyers of Bitcoins in the future if I want to sell compared to some random altcoin.
Take a look at  and set it on the 1 day or 3 day chart,  LTC has been holding pretty steady against BTC with a blip there when some Chinese exchanges started trading it.  LTC's market cap has been holding steady at about 5% of BTC's.  BTC is the gorilla and through arbitrage LTC and most of the other coins have no choice but to follow Bitcoin's price around.  Not saying that can't or won't change but I don't really see it happening, although I do keep a look out.

One chain will become practically worthless.  Bitpay, Coinbase and all the exchanges will only be accepting coins from a single chain, not both.  Unless the community makes a big stink, I believe they will standardize on the large block fork as it gives them a larger potential customer base.
@_date: 2015-05-11 09:30:34
It can be easy if you have a direct line to a portion of the hash rate. Those miners are free to ignore your broadcast TX and work on the TX you passed to them privately.  Eventually such practices would be exposed by burned merchants and responsible miners would be shamed into leaving that pool.  But up to a certain point hash rate can be anonymous as well.
@_date: 2015-05-09 06:48:01

At any rate, excluding 9999 out of 10000 is unacceptable to me.  I certainly do not encourage any further adoption.  Microsoft, Newegg and Dell accepting bitcoin payments is a cruel joke.  BitPay's business model is flawed.  Are you in the market to buy any bitcoins?

If they have the hashpower.  It would be in the interest of their pool's participants to switch if such a scenario happened.  If such a miner doesn't have to worry about that, we have escalated to the 51% problem and have more significant issues than disk space.

Miners will love you for all the fees you feed them.  At that rate it is almost 5 bitcoins worth of fees every 10 minutes, assuming the standard 0.0001 fee.  If you don't send with fees, not many of your Tx's will be included in blocks and therefore won't truly exist and affect the 7TPS limit (which is based on how much space is available in a block).

The current strategy is to let them burn through their stash as mining fees.  The main problem is that a block can only be 1 mb in size.  If their spam is encroaching on the block size limits, people will increase their fees to get into a block as highter priority than the spam.  Bitcoins do not grow on trees, in order for a government to amass a bitcoin warchest they need to buy those bitcoins from you and me in the first place.

Running a full node today has never been free but somehow the costs associated with the cludged-in 1mb block limit is perfect? 
An entity filling blocks would have to pay fees for each of the 60k or so transactions needed to fill a block every 10 minutes.  That would be a significant transfer of bitcoin from the entity to the miners.

Anybody who's spent 2 minutes due diligence looking at this asset should have a firm understanding of the supply schedule.  It is mathematically defined for the past and future of bitcoin. Such a person has already internalized the supply schedule, knows where the coins are coming from, at what rate, etc., and factored all that into their price targets.

Ok each of the million of real users should setup a node or two.  Then millions of nodes will be consuming all that bandwidth, 30 GB SSD * millions of users and crunching all those numbers to be exactly as much in agreement as the nodes are today. We would gain "something" but at what net cost to society? We can measure the cost in dollars, how do we measure the benefit if each person ran a node?

To be safest, the fee is 0.0001 BTC.  Miners reject transactions if it doesn't have the proper fee.  This is a protection against DDOS of the network, a protection against double-spends and a way miners make money for processing transactions.

I think there is one way.  BitcoinXT validation code can require that some particular block must be larger than 1MB, let's say block 420,000 - the next reward halving.
From that time forward both chains can exist and XT cannot fallback to the small blocks chain even if it is longer.
@_date: 2015-05-28 11:34:03
Depends on which definition of superior you are using.  Gold does not suffer from a block size limit.    An astronomical number of transactions may take place cheaply across the globe between parties that are in close proximity to each other.  Such in-person transactions are capable of leaving no trace.  Gold does not require electricity or digital communications. Gold also benefits from thousands of years of use and trust.

Only if you count blocks coming out slightly faster because of added hashrate before the difficulty adjusts.  The network adjusts to target the same amount of time between blocks (constant new supply of coins) no matter if everybody is mining with graphing calculators or ASICs.

Ignoring all political and economic issues, Bitcoin-core would run best with extremely small blocks: The coinbase transactions and room for 1, maybe 2, normal transactions.

In a society where "The Greater Good" has all the rights and privileges and individuals have little to none, then each purchase must first be approved by society.  Where rights are weighed heavily towards the individual no external permission is necessary.
Since individual and society's needs and desires are not always aligned, there is conflict.  What type of society do we have or want to have?  
I support a society where child pornography is "wrong" but to actually enforce this wrongness in a non-cosmetic way entails a deep invasion of everybody's privacy.  This I do not support.

Yep, there are conflicting ideas of what Bitcoin is.
As currently designed Bitcoin apparently runs OK on Mom's DSL and WindowsME.  A whopping 6,000 nodes are taking advantage of this easy access.  However, this necessarily means that no more than 5/1000th of 1% of humanity can make a bitcoin transaction today  (1 person in 20,000).  
If that is a fine and dandy design goal, do nothing more.  Halting bitcoin adoption is probably a good idea in that case.  When we get around to it we can roll out Lightning networks or whatever.
I run 4 nodes and 2 testnet nodes and am more than willing to support 20 MB blocks.  I don't see Bitcoin succeeding if we don't.

In order for the price to stay exactly the same demand must increase 11%.  Currency production will occur at the same mathematical rate no matter price.  Of course this is all working with the stupid-ass assumptions that miners sell all newly created coins and that nobody else is divesting older coins. Obviously it is more complicated than that...

You potentially save storage and bandwidth...  But No Guarantee.  If some fee market is actually operating don't we assume the blocks are nearly full anyways?  
The transactions you save to disk look almost identical no matter if they are for coffee or big banks paying other big banks.  You volunteer to run a node but you imply that storing transactions between banks is preferred data to store on your disk compared to coffee purchases?  Why?

You have to be careful about how your wallet software handles new keys (for change and for new receiving addresses).  A backup wallet can become out-of-sync and not have all of the keys if new keys are generated and added only to your live wallet.  I believe the reference client's default is to generate 100 keys ahead (but with a file name *.wallet, I don't believe this applies to you).  HD wallets don't really have this problem.

That's just, like, your opinion man.  Who are you to say which payments I receive don't "require" non-reversability?  Your argument is prohibitive fees will enforce your rules about how the blockchain should or shouldn't be used?  Those whose circumstances force them to rely on Bitcoin's anti-censorship properties the most will be the ones most raped by fees?
At any rate, ignoring the way you want to label other peoples  transactions, and ignoring whatever fee might be included, if just 1 person in 10,000 did 1 transaction per day the blockchain is already overloaded.   Decentralization for the 0.01% is cool and all but I just don't see Bitcoin succeeding in the long term under such constraints.

A person could be meticulously splitting his bitcoin into the minimum UTXO amounts while staying well within the current stunted block size limit.  
Obviously the solution is to have fewer owners/users of bitcoin, and the large bitcoin owners who remain need to consolidate their holdings in just a few outputs, regardless of block size.

Although it is not directly correlated but a 20x increase in transactions would seem to indicate a significant increase in adoption.  Currently the percentage of bitcoin users who run a full node is tiny. That percentage would likely get even smaller with a 20x increase in transactions.  However, the total pool of bitcoin users would increase by perhaps 20x.  We could see a net increase in the number of nodes.

Maybe. Maybe not.  
Bitcoin works just fine today.  I am happy with my ability to easily access my cold storage and/or buy coffee with bitcoin and nodes are happy verifying those transactions on slow internet connections and cheap disk drives. 
Given the supply-side facts on the ground (tiny amount of block space) it is in our self interest (those who value their ability to make transaction on-demand) to try and restrict the demand-side (a tiny userbase).  Various buzzwords and vaporware might eventually be built that could support more users without degrading one of the main reasons I value bitcoin.  But hope is not a reasonable strategy.

Probably worth it to remind ourselves why bitcoin has the permanent blockchain record in the first place... It protects you and I from receiving counterfeit bitcoins without needing a 3rd party to verify transactions.  Given that, yes, there is analysis that can be applied to that permanent record.  What governments end up doing or not doing with that analysis is a political question, not a protocol question.

The only modifications on the Blockchain are units of bitcoin moving from public key(s) to other public key(s).
So there's that.  All the 2nd level applications built on top of the block chain are restricted to that base.  Colored coins are units of bitcoin tagged to represent something else.  For instance, 1000 satoshis could represent 100 shares of Apple stock.  The tagged bitcoin would be worth more than what the amount of bitcoin is worth.  Think of it like ancient or rare gold coins.  The collectors item is worth more than the melt value of the gold in the coin.  The is some controversy because the colored coins could be transferring much value than but only minuscule fees are being paid to the miners to secure the network.

I don't agree with your faith in the long term success of the experiment.  I find it likely we smack against the capacity limit, the project falters, looses momentum and remains a niche curiosity for 0.005% of the people.  Anyways, we'll see what happens.  If Bitcoin remains elitist I'll be selling.  I certainly do not encourage others to embrace bitcoin under the current circumstances. Sounds like with your understanding of the technological hurdles you share that view?

More granularity.  Right now if you don't want zero-conf your only next option is 1 confirmation.  Quicker blocks means you could target the equivalent of 0.5 block confirmations.   Some merchant's risk profile is such that 3 confirmations is too weak while 4 might be just a touch of an overkill.  This would allow merchants to target 3.5 confirmations.

I would guess no.  There is no output for the miner's fee.  The colored coin used as an input in a transaction would cryptographically get tied to one of the outputs in that transaction or, if the outputs are too small, perhaps would cryptographically be destroyed.  What used to be the colored coin will show up as normal fungible bitcoin currency in the coinbase transaction in a block.

True that. But I am working on the assumption that each user would have at least some minimum demand for the scarce space on the blockchain. If bitcoin has a 1% adoption rate (mainstream?) the average user cannot have more than 2 transactions on the blockchain per year. Because math.  Perhaps my assumption is wrong.  Perhaps the vast majority of users will not utilize cold storage and otherwise never touch the blockchain.  But at least they'll be able to verify that blockchain they never use on WindowsME.

Only if it the new capacity is actually used.  Currently, at about 6,000 nodes, the percentage of bitcoiners running a full node is tiny.  A 20x increase in transactions implies an increase in adoption.  While the percentage of bitcoiners running a full node will probably decrease, the pool of total bitcoiners will likely increase. Will the percentage of those running a node decrease by 20x?  We could see a net increase in nodes as adoption increases while the percentage of those running a node decreases.

@_date: 2015-05-30 06:42:00
All other methods to address scaling are either centralized solutions (think Mt. Gox) or pipedreams at this point.   
Increasing capacity by a factor of 20 could maybe kinda sorta seem substantial.  The first year after the upgrade would allow 4 times as many transactions as the total of all bitcoin transactions that have ever been processed since Bitcoin began in 2009.
@_date: 2015-05-10 23:49:37
Perhaps we should just steer people away from bitcoin so we can preserve the same spare capacity as today.  
Sure, the price would crash as speculators realize bitcoin will continue to just be used by 1/100th of 1% of humanity. But so what? At least I'll be able to run a full node on WindowsXP and have access to my cold storage without fighting about over-subscribed block space.

By adoption I mean each user has a least some minimum demand for the scarce space on the blockchain.  With 1 MB blocks bitcoin tops out at 350k transaction per day.  In 200 days bitcoin can process no more than 70 million transactions.  1% of humanity is 70 million people.  If 1% adopts bitcoin and you are an average bitcoiner, expect 200 days to pass between each time you successfully post a transaction to the blockchain.

I don't really see the point of stuffing them full of fees at this point in time.  You can send them high fees if you want, nothing is stopping you.
Space in the block chain is a scare resource with utterly **inelastic supply**.  So scarce that only 5/1000th of 1% of humanity can utilize it each day by making a single transaction.  Funny things happen when resources with inelastic supply are consumed to the maximum.  For instance, fresh water and food after a natural disaster knocks out normal supplies.

That could have worked if it was designed in from the start.
A rule such as:   When the mathematical decay of the block reward goes below 0.1 BTC, replace the reward with 0.1 BTC forever.
But it wasn't and 2/3 of all bitcoins have already been mined. I don't see the incentives for the current owners of bitcoins to change the rules at this point.  Only if the security of the network suffers at some unknown point in the future.

I would consider your description of bitbargain to be an exchange.  Exchanges connect buyers with sellers. They do not sell their own pool of coins.

Coinbase runs a separate exchange service that matches buyers and sellers.

Sounds a bit like ripple.  While ripple's units do have a little value I understand their main purpose is to be markers/derivatives of other items of value (I.e., Euros, Bitcoins). This is what Taler describes itself as, as well.  Sounds like you have to SEPA Euros to them, whoever "they" are, then you can use Euros on the Taler network.  It sounds centralized:  I assume that REST interface they are talking about is directed at a server not under your own control :(  It is not inconceivable that remote server would crash for the long haul or get raided or hacked.

If something like Bitcoin ever existed before we could use it as a reference. But it didn't. Satoshi wasn't god.  Neither are any of the Core devs or you or myself or even Mighty Krugman. 
Certainly if Bitcoin saw transaction volume in the Visa range there would be quite the pool of fees to pay for mining.     That seems to be a goal to pursue, no?  Either that or very few transactions with extortion-level fees...

"I think we can accept 5MB block at most."

If gold investors had any balls they would demand physical delivery of their asset. But they don't and rehypothecation seems the order of the day. The physical coin shops just follow along tagging their in-store premiums on top of the spot price. If people really want gold at this "attacked lower" price they can walk in to a store and buy it -- last I checked there was still some available for sale under the glass cases.  
It is possible this could happen in bitcoin. However taking delivery of bitcoin is much easier than gold. I also wonder which bitcoin exchange would allow naked shorting and the like on their platform and would they have any customers? If such an exchange has very few customers, it won't produce arbitrage across the other exchanges and impact the price.

Unless they open up mining on the bitgold network to the entire world, it will not be a cryptocurrency.  What incentives will bitgold offer miners to secure the network?  Give away gold with each block?   More likely the ledger will be a MS-Excel spreadsheet fully under their control and you will interact with it using some PGP/Bitcoin-type signing wizardry.  Wow.   Without Proof-of-Work it is just another centralized stab at the e-gold idea.  Even with decentralized mining, vaulting the gold on behalf of users introduces too much risk and centralization.

You mine bitcoins by solving a block.  When you solve the block you get the entire reward (currently 25 bitcoins).  The chances of you solving a block are just about a hair above zero.  You'd have to pool your mac mini's resources with others in the hopes that one of you in your pool solves a block and then shares the winnings with everybody in your pool based on how much hash power each person commits.  Your mac mini commits practically zero power.

1. The most profitable miners have figured out how to get their electricity free or at least dirt cheap.

3. An ecosystem (ecossistem?) can mean different things to different people.   1 new transaction from 1 new wallet seems like growth for a very basic definition of ecosystem, no?

LN in theory can have a place.  But right now it is just that: a theory.  It relies upon entirely different and untested trust and security models.  Which can be OK, but they are just that: untested.  
Opening a channel, top up a channel, merchant settlement and users withdrawing excess funds are blockchain transactions so congesting on the blockchain can be decreased but not eliminated by LN.  If you know the amount you are going to send and only send it once, it makes no sense to use LN, it would actually be more blockchain bloat.

\ Sure, technological advances happen, the price of electricity fluctuates, but the market self-corrects.  Why would anybody spend $2000 on electricity to mine $1000 worth of bitcoin?  On the other hand, why not spend $1000 on electricity to mine $2000 worth of bitcoin? (hint: others will do the same thing which brings the profit margin down)
\ This gets into one of the central reasons why somebody like me assigns value to bitcoin.  The ability to send any amount to anybody anywhere anytime without any 3rd party interference re-establishes some personal freedom and liberty (despite possible government diktats against such activity).
\ Bitcoin transactions typically have a 0.0001 BTC fee that is also awarded to the miners (in addition to newly generated coins).  At some point the fee award will be greater than the generation award, especially if the number of transactions greatly increase.

So let's say you buy 1 whole bitcoin on Bitstamp, then you buy a bunch of little pieces of a bitcoin, then you sell 1/2 a bitcoin and then buy 1/3 a bitcoin.  And now you magically have keys sitting on your own computer for all those pieces?

Nobody has the private key to that address.  Somebody just typed in a bunch of ones then added the [checksum]( to the end (required for the address format).  The network doesn't know who has which private keys, so as long as the address obeys the rules, you can send (BURN) coins to it.  
You are encouraged to freak out if you see an outgoing TX from that address, or the [CounterParty burn address]( the [BitcoinEater addres]( etc.
You can create addresses that start with some custom letters/numbers just by creating tons of them until you get a match (using [VanityGen]( for instance).  But nothing as customized as that address.

Most people do not have harddrives and internet connectivity prepared for  potentially 14 gigabytes of of new blockchain data each day (420 GB/month).

The bitcoin network can process about 500,000 transactions per day, or 1 transaction for 0.008% of the population.  The other 99.992%, **by design**, is shit out of luck no matter how much they might pay in fees.  
If every US citizen did 1 measly transaction (ignoring the rest of the world) it would clog up the blockchain for 20 months, regardless of how much they spend on fees.

If there is not enough demand to match some new supply coming on the market, the price would decline, no doubt about it.

Mind you, a network that only 5/1000th of 1% can receive a payment on for any given day. But the common man with his DSL and WindowsME can run a node. The other 99.995% will need to use mt.gox or coinbase or litecoin.

I get paid 100% in bitcoin (but weekly rather than monthly).  The conversion ratio is completely up to you and your own circumstances / risk profile.  I am willing to hold at least as much Bitcoin as a I receive in one paycheck (haha, actually tons more).   This way I receive my payment on some address and while it is confirming I have Bitcoin already deployed at Coinbase (or wherever) ready to sell.  While the value of my float can fluctuate weekly/monthly the actual paycheck doesn't have any volatility.

Certainly open to suggestions.  The important thing is that the Bitcoin ecosystem can scale up to handle new users when needed while staying competitive with traditional payment options.  The give/take on this is the strain it places on nodes  (Miners are compensated with block rewards, at least for the next decade, I'm not as concerned about them).

Good point.  
Currently, if 1 person in 10,000 does 1 transaction per day the blockchain is already overloaded.  If the spirit moves him/her, that person is able to run a full node on an average computer.  Currently, out of a population of 7 billion, a whopping 6,000 are taking advantage of that opportunity.  Ensuring those 6,000 can run a full node on a mediocre setup excludes 9,999 out of every 10,000 people from being able to use Satoshi's invention directly.
Given current technology, obviously not everybody will be able to post to the blockchain everyday.  But we can do better than excluding 99.99% of humanity.

There are no private keys to own. They sell your bitcoins on the market when you "lock" in fiat or paper gold, etc., and promise to hold the fiat until you want to convert to (buy) bitcoins again.  Really just another middleman between you and a bitcoin exchange.
@_date: 2015-01-17 14:18:04
You can short bitcoin at Bitfinex and most of the Chinese exchanges, as long as there are coins available to be borrowed at the interest rate you are willing to pay.
I don't know of any exchange that allows you to *naked* short or if anybody would trade on such an exchange.

Well, there are trade-offs...   If you receive a bitcoin and you don't trust the person who sent it, you don't trust banks, you trust nobody, how the hell do you know if the Bitcoin is real or not?   You check the chain of blocks for valid signatures all the way from when it was first mined until it landed in your wallet.  
Obviously you can continue to use centralized services that you trust (banks, paypal?).  That's up to you.  Bitcoin removes the need of 3rd parties or trust in order to receive payments.  But we need that that public ledger backed by huge amounts of spent processing power in order to trust no one.
Always use new addresses, never reuse an address.  This obfuscates your identity somewhat and the identity of people you are doing business with.  New technologies that are maturing will go even further.  Look into Stealth Addresses and CoinJoin...

By definition a "paper wallet" or "cold address" is one who's public key has never been seen on the network. 
Once you spend from a cold address/paper wallet, the public (but not private) key is exposed and no longer fulfills that definition.

Gavin, some bullets to better arm yourself with the next time Lightning Network comes up:
1. It is a different trust model.  No need to qualify it as "poorer" or anything, just note that it is a different model that people will be asked to participate with.
2. It doesn't exist.  There is no merchant that accepts Lightning payments and we have no idea when they will.
3. The authors of the Lightning Network PDF explicitly state their security model suffers under the 1MB block regime.  Their security model works best if blocks are capable of handling large spikes of transactions for some period of time.
On another note, try to ask the people you are debating to say roughly how many transactions per day 1MB blocks can support and what percentage of humanity are mathematically excluded from modifying the blockchain each day because of that limit.
@_date: 2015-05-29 17:25:30

Miners will work on whichever chain is the most profitable for them.  Miners require a way to convert to fiat in order to pay the bills and they require liquidity.
Seems to me the Bitcoin Exchanges are the determining factor in providing a fiat exit and liquidity.  
With 1MB blocks, assuming no other bitcoin commerce is happening on the blockchain, no more than 5/1000th of 1% of the world can deposit or withdrawal bitcoins to any bitcoin exchange today.  It would seem to me they would want to open their potential customers to more users.

1. The amount of resources dedicated to mining over a period of time should be just slightly less then the *value of the bitcoins mined* over that same amount of time. If $500 million worth of bitcoins were created in a year, just slightly less than $500 million will be spent on mining (in a competitive, fluid market)... Rational miners should not operate at a loss (better to just buy bitcoin), on the other hand profit from mining should mostly get eaten away through miners willing to undercut their competition.  
2. Whether or not these mining resources are "good use" or whatever should be decided by those who are actually deploying them. I just don't think you are qualified to tell people how they should or should not use their own resources.  Besides, seeking profit is not much concerned with what is "good and proper."  If there is profit in mining bitcoins somebody somewhere will seek it.
3. The amount of new bitcoins is finite but the amount of bitcoins available from fees over time is unlimited.
4. Literally *nobody* in the past 6 years has thought through the same points in your blog post. /s

oh noes, 20mb blocks,  the end of decentralization!
I think the responsible thing to do here is discourage new adoption until the folks get back from the time machine with lightning networks!  
The small spare capacity that we have today is one of the main reasons why I value Bitcoin.  If I have to forcefully elbow people out of the way just to access my own goddamn cold storage, bitcoin loses value to me.  The other reasons why I value bitcoin is that it is a limited supply currency created competitively outside the confines of any gooberment, and yes, decentralization is also valuable to me.
I am actively trying to turn new users away from bitcoin in my conversations online and in person in order to protect one of the main reasons why I find bitcoin useful. The choices we make have consequences.

The blockchain allows modifications by no more than 5/1000th of 1% of humanity each day.  But you can run this global transaction and verification system over DSL and WindowsME, so that's cool.
I will be spinning up nodes, too.  As it stands now I am no longer willing to sink capital into this fringe experiment.  I am a Bitcoin seller.  I no longer recommend Bitcoin to my peers.

I cited their interview, 1 hour in.  Yes, contracts timing out gives an attacker an incentive to fill blocks to maximum.  They also reference the risk of  the centralized nodes in the Lightning Network coming under attack (i.e., hacked or seized) leading to a large flood of contracts closing on the blockchain.

Well, if small blockers saw zero risk in increasing the max block size I doubt they would work so hard to block it.  But hey, bitcoin is still in beta.  I strongly believe the network will work just fine with 8 MB blocks.  If small blockers can't handle that risk perhaps they are over invested in this experimental money.  If bitcoin can't be honey badger enough to handle 8 MB blocks with current technology, I need to know this sooner rather than later so I don't waste anymore time on some fringe tech toy.

Fungibility is great and all but what counts is actually making  transactions between buyers and sellers.

You are claiming there is a measurable correlation between maximum block size and mining pool centralization?  Where is the data? The marginal miner is always turning off or joining a pool and I submit that the max block size has no measurable affect on that fact.


So what? What is the "correct" number of full nodes?  How did you come up with this number?  Larger blocks allows for more users.  More users can lead to more full nodes even if the ratio of nodes to users decreases.  (A user defined as somebody with at least some minimum demand for space on the blockchain)


Just during the window of time miners are downloading and verifying the new block, assuming an attacker goes ahead and does POW for a block that he knows will eventually be discarded after verification?  Is there any evidence this attack has happened or is likely?


Ah yes, the mythical lowest common denominator computer.  What are the specs of this mythical computer that we are designing Bitcoin around?  I find no mention of this computer in the white paper.  When and by whom was it added to the core protocol?  Some businesses I am talking with are interested in Bitcoin but need to know these specs before wasting any further resources on it.

As Gregory Maxwell has said: "Fundamentally this question exposes ideological differences between people

Is it not possible that the core devs have gone too far into the theoretical realm and have lost touch with the community.  Are we just blindly following the prognoses of this handful of people, even if they might be wrong?  
We are appealing to the Core Dev's technical prowess to make ideological, political and economic decisions for us.  This is wrong.  
With pools representing over 50% of the hashpower commiting to larger blocks, and large Bitcoin liquidity services such as Coinbase, BitPay and OKCoin, etc., supporting larger blocks, and (unscientific) polls showing 75% of users consistently supporting larger blocks, we are also trying to disprove the saying "the market is always right."

If more than 1/3 million people want to make a bitcoin transaction today they will be forced to do it off chain using centralized services. But at least they'll be able to run a node on mom's WindowsME box, yes? Thanks to tiny blocks, only 5/1000th of 1% can make a transaction on any given day.  Bitcoin adoption is laughably small so that isn't a problem right now.  On the other hand Adam Back [claimed]( 99% of bitcoin transactions are currently off chain using centralized services.  Don't know where he pulled that figure out of but maybe it is a problem?

Certainly they don't republish transactions in new blocks that have already been published on the blockchain in previous blocks.  If that were the case they would either: only do coinbase blocks or consistently have their blocks rejected.  Neither is the case.  They usually reconcile new blocks against their mempool but, evidently, they weren't validating against the brand new soft fork: BIP 66/strict DER
@_date: 2015-07-07 05:11:38
Tradeblock says the earlier block was found 6 seconds  after the previous block and then the next one was found 54 seconds later.  Basically those miners didn't have enough time to download and settle the previous block against their mempool during that time.  Rather then turning off their miners while they validate previous blocks, they start mining an empty block and got lucky.

I believe Jeff Garzik's is the best proposal so far.  Miners, individually, will be setting their own block size limit anyways.  We see this already with some pools topping out at 3/4 MB and whatever the fuck censorship filter Eligius is running.  Then why not let them explicitly state the max block size as a group effort.  I also like how [BIP100]( allows for squeezing blocks smaller after a while.  Bitcoin needs to be able to transition from a phase of high inflation paying for security (1.3 million bitcoins created this year) to a fees based security model.  Right now high fees on top of high inflation would kill bitcoin.  But in the future we all need miners to gain significant revenue from fees or there won't be any security.  One tool they could use as a group would be to squeeze blocks smaller or stop block growth, if it really came to that.

Each coin is superior in different ways..  Litecoin can support 4x more transaction throughput and has more full nodes running.  Bitcoin consumes more of this planet's limited supply of electricity and, therefore, makes a theoretical 51% attack more expensive.

Gavin submitted BIP101 to the main branch (predominately under control of for-profit blockstream guys):
Haven't heard much of anything since.  
Lightning Shazzaminess is years away. And I guarantee you major merchants accepting payments through the Lightning Networks will require AML/KYC across the Centralized Lightning Nodes on par with or exceeding what we see in the Credit Card industry today.
My worst fear is a surge in adoption.  If 1% of the world pulls their head out of their ass and adopts bitcoin you and I can only access our cold storage maybe once or twice a year if we are lucky.  And have no other interaction with the blockchain. Peter, Adam and Gregory seem to be chill wit dat, word yo.
So, I work against adoption while the blocks remain tiny. Small blocks are a self-reinforcing policy and it seems everybody who is in favor of small blocks is happy with that.

Whereas any little burp in bitcoin adoption right now will run into capacity limits,  
Whereas there are no merchants, bitcoin exchanges, or wallets that accept LN payments,  
Whereas if you try to tell me AML/KYC, blacklisting and censorship will be more difficult to implement on LN I won't believe you,  
Increase capacity.
If LN really will be the bees' knees, then it will take over the majority of payments volume when it gets released into the wild.  Adjusting the anti-spam block size limit down at that point is a soft fork and/or miner policy.


Oh yeah, sir, we are all frickin' screaming to do that overnight if not sooner!!!
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:08:52
Gregory Maxwell proposed: 


between some minimum (e.g. 500k) and the miner's effective-maximum;
the actual block size can be up to the effective maximum even if the
preference is lower (you're not forced to make a lower block because you
stated you wished the limit were lower).  There is a computed maximum
which is the 33-rd percentile of the last 2016 coinbase preferences
minus computed_max/52 (rounding up to 1) bytes-- or 500k if thats
larger. The effective maximum is X bytes more, where X on the range
[0, computed_maximum] e.g. the miner can double the size of their
block at most. If X &gt; 0, then the miners must also reach a target
F(x/computed_maximum) times the bits-difficulty; with F(x) = x^2+1  ---
so the maximum penalty is 2, with a quadratic shape;  for a given mempool
there will be some value that maximizes expected income.  (obviously all
implemented with precise fixed point arithmetic).   The percentile is
intended to give the preferences of the 33% least preferring miners a
veto on increases (unless a majority chooses to soft-fork them out). The
minus-comp_max/52 provides an incentive to slowly shrink the maximum
if its too large-- x/52 would halve the size in one year if miners
were doing the lowest difficulty mining.

I see the opposite.  Services did not crash (protip: blockchain.info doesn't count). Miners are still chugging along even with high TPS rates on the network.   The UTXO set, like you said, will change "regardless of block size."  
Miners not including spam with smaller blocks are not required to start including it with larger blocks.  
Better to be proactive rather than strangle new adoption when it happens unexpectedly.  At any rate I'm not out there banging the drums for adoption while tiny blocks rule the day and I'm certainly not looking to buy any more coins.

Partially reflected in the price.  If that weren't a remote possibility bitcoin would probably be valued higher.

F2Pool consistently builds rather large blocks. How can they know that the transactions inside the blocks they build are not included in previous blocks (therefore making it invalid) unless they parse and settle the previous blocks?

Bitcoin doesn't scale.  Rather, we can't seem to get the oligarchy in charge of the reference source code to allow it to.  The mythical creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, put a TEMPORARY ANTI-SPAM limit in the source code that has since been enshrined as "CONSENSUS".  This 1 MB limit every block means Bitcoin can handle no more than 3 transactions per second.  That works out to 5/1000th of 1% of the world able to send a blockchain transaction per day.  Everybody else is shit out of luck.   There are layers being worked on to go on top but they won't be ready for quite some time.    
Right now  shows a back log of 46k transactions waiting to be put in the blockchain.  That would fill 78 blocks under ideal conditions.  Much of that is "SPAM" but the situation is not ideal.

After the block reward subsidy degrades significantly I'm not entirely sure there will be enough fees paid 24/7/365 to strongly secure the bitcoin network against attack.

Yeah, generally things aren't regulated.  Human behavior is regulated by governments.  Things that people own can make them liable to government.  For instance, some jurisdictions have laws against unkempt lawns.  They don't take the grass to court and throw the grass in jail.  They go after the property owners.
Like those offending weeds, Bitcoin gives fuck-all about any of that.

Where's the math you used to prove this?  Increasing the number of orphans 5-fold does not seem like a great idea.  Yes, I think the network would get by and survive with 2.5 to 2 minute blocks but that doesn't add any additional security, just a little more granularity. I don't think it is worth it.  The code to modify validation of the block reward as well as the difficulty is no small task with a distributed, multi-platform, multi-language ecosystem we already have.

To be fair, performance of "bitcoin" has improved at least 100x over the ensuring years.  But now it is time for those calling themselves core devs to make good on claims they made years ago about how bitcoin governs itself by giving us the tools to do so.
@_date: 2015-09-28 20:30:53
This question and the question of how to boot full nodes from scratch many years down the road are central to the block size debate.
If we answer either question definitively, how does it affect the other question.  What criteria do we use to decide...  
Do we focus on what allows Bitcoin to be the most super-redundant motherfucking bad ass decentralized bitgold settlement layer in the solar system (never mind that hardly anybody can actually write to the blockchain)?  Are we sure that settlement layers are not going to be solved more elegantly in the future?  Will going this route make Bitcoin the runt of the liter, unnecessarily stunting Bitcoin's development? If Bitcoin can handle more capacity, do we purposefully hobble it anyways? What allows Bitcoin to grow into its full potential? What does that even mean, how can we predict that?
Are these criteria at odds with each other?  If we can't have both, who gets to decide?  theymos?
Is it possible to forestall or stop the Market from making this decision on its own?

Disinterested as in "not interested?"  Are they dis-incentivized, though?  Slightly different question.
Mostly merchants do not accept payments directly themselves, they have 3rd party processors handle the receiving end.  They are *disinterested* in handling payments directly because A) technically complicated and B) 3rd party handles the fiat conversion as well, which is what they are actually interested in.  I am not talking about them.  
Merchants who handle payments in-house are incentivized to run a node because if not, they are too easily defrauded by double-spends.  People who primarily just spend bitcoins acquired from a source they trust (such as Coinbase?, shrugs) are not worried they are going to be double-spent against.  Privacy, as it relates to the later group, has a different set of incentives.  
Generally incentives are not black and white and can only be spoken of in a general way across groups.  Sometimes incentives work at cross-currents.  Sometimes tech comes along that changes incentives. Again, sorry for being curious.

@_date: 2015-09-28 02:36:40
The main objection I see to increasing the block limit is that such a change is not included in "Bitcoin Core."  
I've seen estimates that CT transactions will be between 2 and 250 times larger than standard transactions.  If CT becomes the standard way to transact, then far, far fewer transactions can hit the blockchain per day/week/year.
It is my understanding that CT would require at least one soft fork.  
When CT is ready to go prime time and the core maintainers are looking to get buy-in from the larger community for the soft fork, there will be a grand bargain reached to get both CT and a larger block cap.
I am not Nostradamus but I am willing to place a wager if anybody wants to take the opposite side on this.

I hope more transactions offset the dwindling block reward.  I doubt those special fringe cases where Bitcoin really shines (i.e., while on the run from oppressive governments) will be enough to pay for real security. Discerning market participants will just use the cheaper solutions, all else being equal.
@_date: 2015-09-03 14:02:41
Security is not the only issue.  But it can be pointed out that the security of LN cannot be higher than the security of the Bitcoin blockchain.  Any transaction taking place on LN that could of taken place on the blockchain is movement of fee income from the Miners to the LN node operators and makes Bitcoin less secure than it could have been.  On the other hand, the aggregate money paid to LN node operators might be less than if it had been paid in blockchain write fees, making consumers happy.

Seriously?  How is asking whether or not some group may be negatively impacted by what the math allows a political question?  Either they are affected or they aren't.  Politics ain't got shit to do with it.
Where do you read into my statements that I am... somehow accusing people of setting out to make CT transactions bigger, or more costly to validate?  I am just trying to gather facts in order to make informed decisions.  
On what planet does it serve anybody's agenda to have CT transactions larger than they need to be? 
However, if I were to get political on this it would go something like this:  
Everybody has slightly different reasons why they value Bitcoin.  One reason I value bitcoin is that people are able to transact with it to pay other people.  If fewer people are able to make payments the value/utility would tend to decrease, in my own mind at least.  This may be offset by other increased utility such as greater privacy.  If 250 times fewer people are able to transact with it, on first glance CT doesn't seem worth the trade-offs.  If CT transactions are only twice as large as tradition BTC payments I may be much more inclined to support CT with words, code or, perhaps, financial backing.
@_date: 2015-09-16 20:17:51
If the market supports this price while 3600 coins are generated per day, I think roughly the same amount of electricity will be purchased and consumed mining bitcoin no matter the hardware.  Less efficient hardware would only mean the 430 million ghash/sec figure would be lower.  
Do you have a reference for this one cpu/ one miner idea?  I don't think many would have been naive enough to think that.  Anonymous bitcoin mining means you can never know how many cpus I'm throwing at the problem.  In a perfectly decentralized world we'd each find a single block once every 7 billion blocks, on average.

I disagree.  Language like "**very, very long term**" and "**short to medium term**" makes it clear we are not talking about some *rush to adopt Lightning*.  For one-time payments, LN makes no sense.

Ok, I yield to overwhelming evidence.  Discussion has been ongoing since at least GMaxwells' 2011 ["Note to Readers"]( on Scalability where he says, "as a decentralized system it is the bitcoin using public who will decide how bitcoin grows."
BTW, it is perfectly fine to multi-task here.  We here on planet earth are able discuss governance in one thread and discuss capacity limits in another.  We are even capable of discussing where the two topics interact!
Discussing and improving governance is equally important as discussing capacity, if not more so.  If bitcoin governance is co-opted by a self-declared oligarchy, capacity is the least of my worries.

Nah, we'll all just fund 100 coins at a time and keep our channels open. Assuming we're all rich.  Either that or we'll have to keep re-organizing our channels on paydays.  Which means blockchain activity.  Which means 1 MB blocks ain't even in the right ballpark if you are thinking volume.

What does a successful attack look like exactly?  
Are you talking about that one attack where the miners waste their proof-of-work in order to spoof blocks?  ...And the SPV wallet is randomly connected only to nodes that are participating in this attack?  ...And the SPV user is not checking 3rd-party block explorers for this high-value transaction that miners are willing to waste their proof-of-work-on OR the 3rd party block explorers he checks put their reputation on the line and are in on the attack?

Remember, Gavin's quote was from 2011.  He was probably daunted by what he foresaw Bitcoin needing to handle to succeed and what his DSL line at the time could handle.
Obviously, we are all daunted by the problem of scaling Bitcoin.  Perhaps he has refined his opninion since then.  Have you checked with him rather than [reposting]( his 4-year-old quote?
We do agree here: if technology doesn't keep improving on par with Moore's Law we going to have to modify (fork) BIP 101 in the future.  My point is: that's a no-brainer.
1 GB blocks are obviously too large in the pre-2016 era. Are 2 MB or 8 MB too large today?  What are you measuring to come up with your answer?
For shits and giggles here's some even older quotes that I thought were relevant when I foolishly decided to buy some bitcoins.  But who is the speaker?

Discuss.  Something on the order of 7 to 10 times the blockspace for the same amount of economic activity?
What soft-fork is required?  Usually there is a BIP for something like that where we ACK/NACK, discuss roll-out time along with some form of a consensus trigger.


But instead, having been captivated by said debate, you worked those several months on block-size blog posts/reddit comments, did a couple interviews, and attended a weekend conference? At any rate it seems all your hard work paid off: I don't think the block size will change anytime soon.

The bitcoin experts don't mention full nodes in relation to those accepting bitcoin payments being the ones with the most important say on the protocol.  I tend to side with the experts on this one.  Doesn't matter if they don't run nodes: if they require the rule in the protocol that 21 mil is the cap, then 21 better be the cap or you'll have to find somebody else who will accept your bitcoins.  Even if merchants all run SPV wallets, eventually Truth Will Out.

don't you mean **p0wnd**?  Anyways I reject that assumption.
Utlra secure?  I highly doubt bitcoin will ever be very costly to use on a per transaction basis.  There is just too much competition in the area of exchanging value between 2 parties. I'm certainly not willing to sit and risk my own capital locked up in bitcoin to see if this fantasy materializes enough to support *ultra security*.  But you go right ahead.

Most?  Blockchain.info was on the wrong chain as par for the course for their general incompetence.  I'm sure that people that continue to use their services would in other respects be competent enough to upgrade their full node software in a timely manner (if they were running full nodes).
Which other block explorers had their incompetence on display then?  
And that was during a soft fork.  Not Bitcoin's typical operational status.  And there is no report of anybody getting defrauded.  We saw that each transaction included in the orphaned chain was also included in the main chain, although in theory some people might have gotten defrauded as addressed in Gavin's talk about receiving a doctored and incorrect UTXO set.

Obviously, a superpower stands a good chance of knocking over our little beehive.   But bitcoin is tiny, it doesn't currently have anywhere close to the resources to defend against that threat right now. Agreed? Its only hope is to grow so fucking big and pervasive that governments will be afraid to piss off their citizen base in that manner.
Take a gander at Litecoin.  It shares the same goal as Bitcoin (an uncorrupted blockchain) and is using the same strategies.  It is also successfully realizing that goal but with far fewer consumed resources.  Those resources (electricity) are either held in reserve or the free market is directing them to activities that are useful.

Not if you wanna be a "true bitcoiner" you can't.
Multibit and Electrum are the main "light wallets" for PC, I believe.  These wallets are not as secure as a full node particularly if your are receiving payments. But you and only you are in full control of your private keys, just like Core.  
If you are mainly spending bitcoins while getting them from a source you trust (maybe Coinbase/Circle/Major Exchange), doesn't running a full node seem like a waste?

From what I can tell both the Bitcoin and the Litecoin blockchains have successfully performed their primary and basically only purpose: preserving the integrity of the data in the chain (each and every block being valid).  Litecoin hasn't had as much up-time as Bitcoin but it has accomplished the same result much more efficiently (using fewer resources).
I seem to recall an interesting event occurred in Bitcoin when the underlying data structure switched from BerkeleyDB to LevelDB and that caused an inadvertant hard fork.  The majority of hash power orphaned their longer, up-to-date chain to build off of the shorter, old verification chain being used by Mt.Gox in particular.

The scenario under discussion is how to boot a node from scratch in 2030.  Under current consensus rules the blockchain may be (quick napkin scrawl) ~800 GB?  Aren't you worried you won't be able to validate 20 years of transactions in a timely manner using current tech?  Then why are you here using a broken system? What will be the average bandwidth and CPU power then?  Truth is we have no earthly idea. Will zero-trust proofs be developed by then that makes this convo all rather pointless?  We better start closing off our potential future because of our fear of what it will be like.
We can't fudge Proof-of-work and we can't fudge any signature that gets hashed and covered by proof-of-work.  You are given a snapshot from a so-called trusted source and the very next block that comes out on the p2p network verifies your snapshot for the inputs consumed in the block, or alarms start clanging.
The UTXO set is the what counts and that UTXO set is identical across all white-hat nodes at a given block height. You can validate every coffee purchase and satoshi dice TX for 20 years and the only artifact you have to show for all that work is that UTXO set.  Even now, in 2015, we are starting to work on ways to pass that set around with low to no trust.
 Validating each individual block as it is published is a much, much lower hurdle.  Go to town on that.

Yes, I do not currently know all the inner workings of CT, especially if/when it gets promoted off the sidechain-testnet.
And for that, please accept my humble apology, sir.  This is all rather new tech, no?
Currently a sidechain is used for CT-testnet.  Will a sidechain still be used for production CT?  
Will I be able to do everything I need to fashion CT transactions, sidechain or not, while NOT running a node?  CT transactions will work fine on the sending and receiving side on SPV-style wallets, no full node needed?  
That's basically the question I was asking.  I was asking out of curiosity how CT would affect the incentives of running a node.  Currently merchants who receive payments are incentivized.  Ordinary users who just send payments out do not have the exact same incentives.
If a full node is needed to fully utilize CT, doesn't that incentive individuals who desire privacy that are currently not running a node to start running one?

I asked a question about incentives as they relate to a generalized "people."  Instead of giving an answer, you asked a specific question to me.  To wit: why do I run a node?  Well, I'll be glad to answer, sir!  I run a node because I've always ran a node, that's how I started with bitcoin back in the day and, I don't know, maybe I'm too lazy to turn it off now.  Satisfied?
Who knows, it may turn out that in order to use CT you MUST connect to a trusted node, unlike SPV wallets which create and broadcast standard TXs without necessarily trusting any particular node. That would be a different incentive at play.

At any rate, when all that verification work is done, it is discarded and a node is left with the important part: an unspent output (UTXO) set.  Said UTXO set is the same as the set with all other unmodified nodes.

How can you guarantee miners will be financed enough to secure the blockchain if scaling bitcoin beyond 1MB blocks is pushed off chain onto theories like LN?  
Here we are dealing with massive amounts of LN transactions but the main network that LN relies on to secure bitcoin (and therefore provide an upper bound to bitcoin's value) locked into 350,000 tx per day.

Strange things happen when supply is inelastic. 
Take, for example, fresh water.  Under normal circumstances demand  and supply reach some type of equilibrium.  Increase demand is met by increased supply or a higher price.  Following me so far?  Econ101 stuff, right?
Now, when a natural disaster strikes, supply is severely restricted and producers cannot make more fresh water even if they want to.  What happens?  It is unpredictable but generally the price explodes and those who cannot meet that price may die of thirst.  
The same is true of the blockchain.  The supply is inelastic, we can make no more space than 1 MB per block even with theoretical infinite demand.  Who knows what will happen. I'm not exactly recommending people get on board to find out.
@_date: 2015-09-10 17:59:51
Well, I wouldn't use this patch as a miner.  As a self-contained hobby node, meh.  Anybody can broadcast anything, if you relay somebody's double-spend because you dropped the previous version, big whoop.  The node you relay it to can decide to halt propagation because he, uh most likely, didn't drop the earlier one.  So a little bit of bandwidth was consumed there.  You as a voluntary global transaction verification node pay for the extra bandwidth or buy more RAM.  Of course if you think increasing the block size limit is hell-spawn this is an issue but otherwise you are committed to the possibility of a transaction throughput increase anyways (with accompanying bandwidth and mempool impacts).
Let the miners sort out the details, thanks to your RBF and this here scenario where our tiny blocks are severely oversubscribed already, we're all relying on confirmations anyways.  


It does require that you sit there and baby-sit your node when spikes occur.  You have to know how to monitor your system's RAM in realtime and judge the impact your BitcoinD and the mempool has on that in realtime and act accordingly. Or set your threshold so high that under normal conditions you don't relay very many TXs but can survive the spikes.

Agreed.  I see no point in trying to suck in new users with the block size stuck at 5/1000th of 1% of humanity able to make a blockchain transaction per day.  Besides, as them core devs are fond of saying, just about every normal use of bitcoin is more efficiently handled by centralized services.

@_date: 2015-09-28 02:21:54
"Literally" blocks will stay capped at 1 MB.  But that is not the only way to think about block space.  You can also think about the space as: how many transactions can fit in?  At the current average TX size, the network can process no more than 350,000 transactions per day, or so.  If average transaction size explodes by a factor of 10, for example, the network can process no more than 35,000 transactions per day.   That's the "effectively" part. 
Increasing the average transaction size effectively shrinks the number of transactions that can be made.  Sorry if I wasn't clear.  In fact, it literally shrinks that number.

Even then, all those millions of transactions have associated costs and profits and could have been paid to miners but instead they are paid to super-centers possibly ran by Visa and PayPal.  No matter how secure LN is by itself, LN's value has an upper bound confined by how difficult it is to 51% attack Bitcoin mining.  There is a similar Colored Coins problem where the density of the value of the information transferred and the compensating fees do not match.  With colored coins The Blockchain can hold value above and beyond what the Bitcoins are worth.   Assuming miners (in their received coinbases) are not paid in colored coins but just generic Bitcoins, attacking Bitcoin through mining while shorting the colored coins assets becomes cost-effective.  In this LN scenario, the Bitcoin economy could be larger than what miners are being paid to secure it.  Those costs and profits being swallowed by LN nodes.

That reminds me, did you know that decentralization is mentioned nowhere in the whitepaper?
Peer-to-peer certainly is mentioned along with a strong reliance on cryptographic proof, incentives, SPV, etc.  
The closest the whitepaper comes to mentioning decentralization is perhaps:


It appears that a conclave of bitcoin ecclesiastics came afterwards and elevated decentralization into infallible canon.
Decentralization is a strategy that can be used to reach some goal.  Decentralization is not a goal unto itself, there can never be perfect decentralization, and it is pointless and/or wasteful to over-pursue any given strategy that is  successfully performing its assigned task in realizing a goal.
Random thoughts.
@_date: 2015-09-20 17:49:55
For 1 MB blocks I think the network could handle a 2.5 minute target right now.  But is it worth it?  Smaller block times increase the rate of block orphans.  Changing the code dealing with the block size is a much smaller change than changing the code that verifies the funds miners receive in the coinbase transaction which will necessarily be smaller per block in addition to how difficulty is calculated.

Not sure why an exchange needs to buy bitcoins since they are supposed to just match sellers with buyers, unless it is for advertising.  I suppose they could increase liquidity on their exchange by selling their own book against the other traders there...?  I looked into itBit at one point when they were located in Singapore but got spooked off when they went all gun-ho on the initial BitLicense draft and moved to New York.

I am convinced an AML/KYC layer will be built into LN, first as a completely optional addition to the protocol but in time it will become de facto required by just about all merchants accepting LN transactions and, therefore, most LN hubs themselves.   Sure there will be TOR based LN hubs but you'll only be able to use those channels on the black market.
@_date: 2015-03-28 17:00:37

To be honest, I think we would have seen more activity on  if 80% were true.  I'm up there in an "interesting" category, mainly because that is the only way I can show support for more capacity at this time while BIP100 does not have anything can kick people out of here for yet.  
I do think there is broad support for capacity increase, 80% being not far off.  I also think Hearn had a press corps working against him.  People are just waiting waiting waiting for anything out of preferred code base.

@_date: 2015-10-02 20:19:24
Security trumps Scalability.  
Without strong security on the main chain, scalability is purely an academic concern.   As coinbase inflation decreases, our security model may require a standing backlog of transactions.  Which implies tiny blocks and a hope a backlog manifests itself and establishes permanency and assuming that is a viable system for bitcoin users.  Some hypothesize that as soon as the next halving miners will turn off their machines until enough fee paying transactions pile up in the mempool.  
Gregory Maxwell [has said]( 


to move the blockchain forward goes away.  An optimal rational miner
would be best off forking off the current best block in order to capture
its fees, rather than moving the blockchain forward, until they hit
the maximum. That's where the "backlog" comment comes from, since when
there is a sufficient backlog it's better to go forward.  I'm not aware
of specific research into this subquestion; it's somewhat fuzzy because
of uncertainty about the security model. If we try to say that Bitcoin
should work even in the face of most miners being profit-maximizing
instead of altruistically-honest, we must assume the chain will not
more forward so long as a block isn't full.

Technically wumpus has the same control over core as Hearn has over XT.  Hearn is offering competing product.  Competition is good for consumers. 
Getting back to XT, all those features are allowed by the protocol.  If you really, really want them not to be created and used, hard fork the protocol.  It is the same with Replace by Fee (RBF).  Pointless to fight against RBF if it is allowed by the protocol.

Gavin probably should have promoted just core+BIP101 and users could have patched in the XT extensions if they wanted.  A strategic error.  
I don't think offering a code base and saying "Here, run this if you want, otherwise have a nice life" can be construed as a coup.  telling you which code base you are allowed to run, effectively defining Bitcoin for you, is much more of a coup.  
You sit there and say CORE HAS CONTROL and somebody is taking that Control away in a coup.  That is not how this is supposed to work, not any of this.

Increasing block size implies more transactions in blocks.
If that is to occur we cannot automatically assume Bitcoin has gained new users, some percentage of which will add nodes to the network.  But we can't assume the opposite: we'd have the same amount or fewer users, they just changed their spending habits and increased costs forced marginal node operators out.  
Growing our user base increases decentralization in many ways, possibly in terms of raw node count as well.  
"How do we increase decentralization" is directly correlated to "how can we make bitcoin more expensive to run as a system."  
An answer to the first question is also an answer to the second.


Now we are getting somewhere.  It is good to split the "why" from the "how."
We want bitcoin to be immune from outside influence. How do we do that? Decentralization.
I think we are immune from the Government of Trinidad and Tobago from messing with us too much.
How many nodes do you think we'll need to prevent the United States of America from strangling bitcoin if it tries?  
Does throttling capacity to 1MB increase our chances of defeating the USA in a meaningful way?  I don't really think so.  
Bitcoin's only hope is to grow so large and pervasive that Governments wouldn't dare offend their citizenry by attacking.  Decentralizing vertically as well as horizontally.  
I think this is the crux of the matter.  Some say maximizing decentralization horizontally (i.e., small blocks) will not harm vertical axis decentralization.  Others say it does affect vertical decentralization.  I don't think maximizing horizontally completely satisfies our goals, i.e., makes us completely safe.

I meant to say that development was certainly not at a standstill all this time.  Just that development in this area was.  The internal processing (signature processing/validation, data look-ups, etc.) of the bitcoind client is 100x more efficient and faster compared to 5 years ago.  Without all that work put into the client over the years, we probably couldn't even have a serious conversation about increasing the loads.

One thing, Bitcoin broke the State monopoly on money creation.  Gold was used as money for thousands of years but kinda went out of fashion.  Fiat had pretty much taken over.

There are trade-offs.  Do you want to limit bitcoin to only 0.008% of the population that could send 1 transaction a day under the current system? You are rejecting the other 99.992% of the world from using bitcoin today so that you can run a node on behalf of those elite 0.008%.  If bitcoin becomes popular you might have to wait days/weeks before you could send to a sidechain or whatever.  But it won't become popular at all under the current regime.

There are 35 million Canadians.  Sending one TX to every Canadian would fill up all bitcoin blocks for about 2.5 months (if everybody else in the world did exactly 0 transactions during that time).

1) How the volatility is dealt with is really up to each person.  Check out Coinapult.com or Bitreserve.org -- They'll lock in a USD amount if you are worried about volatility.  I cash out just as much fiat as I need and keep the rest in Bitcoin, but I'm super crazy and have balls of steel.  
2) Some banks close accounts that have dealings with bitcoin exchanges/companies on a hit-or-miss basis.  I've never had any problems with my credit union yet.  Bitcoins are legal but you do owe taxes on your bitcoin income like any other income.

10 blocks at 60 seconds is the same security as 1 block every 10 minutes.  For most high-value transactions (depositing to an exchange) 3 or more blocks are required.  This would require 30 blocks of the new style.  No real difference.  I could see how 60 second gradient could be useful if you want, say, 1/2 a confirmation of the current style but block headers and other peer-to-peer communication would increase the bandwidth required.    This would also complicate the block reward calculations and settings.

Technically, you pay income tax on your received salary at the "standard" exchange rate when you receive bitcoins.  You pay capital gains taxes when you sell bitcoins for more than what you received them at.  (You can also record losses this way that offset your other tax liabilities).

A theory. I am of the Austrian school which pretty much disagrees with the assumptions leading to that theory.  Anyways, buckets of gold are not very useful in and of themselves.  Their only real use is in what goods and services they can be exchanged for.  When the price is right, deflation is halted by the desire for what money can buy.

Decentralization is a tool, a strategy that can be used to achieve a goal.  If bitcoin is 20X more decentralized than it needs to be to achieve the goal, I would not say that is the best use of resources. 
Decentralization Maximalism can be harmful to Bitcoin because of the opportunity cost. 
10,000,000 nodes would make the system about 10,000,000 times more expensive to operate than  10,000 nodes. There must be a balance, not some blind pursuit of decentralization perfection.

Assuming low minting reward, if the mempool/feepool is empty, you might as well work off the block before the one just solved rather than the longest chain.  You don't give up anything because there are *not enough* transactions yet and you a have a chance to orphan the longest chain's last block and steal those fees.

21 million is the result of all the mining rewards added together.  He could have started with a reward like 61.298666 for the first blocks and keep halving it down but 50 seems like a nice round number.  Also, 21 million bitcoins expressed as satoshis fits well inside numeric units used in most programming languages.  In the end it doesn't really matter.

You argue that liquidity will diffuse amoung millions or trillions of altcoins.  This is not an original argument, it has been suggested many, many times before.  Over the past year the market has done the opposite, Bitcoin  has grown in terms of cryptocurrency market share while the number of altcoins has ballooned.  I think new investors, if they have half a brain, will continue to select the cryptocurrency with the most liquidity and hashrate security.  But the jury is still out, we'll just have to wait and see..

With 1 mb blocks "decentralized" bitcoin can support 0.008% of the people sending 1 transaction per day.  The other 99.992% are shit out of luck.  Granted moving to 20mb blocks only helps us support 0.16% of the population.  Good thing I'm a 1%er!

Greece has a population of 11 million.  Bitcoin can handle at most 500,000 transactions per day.  This means if Greece adopts bitcoin then less than 5% of the Greek population can do a single transaction per day (if everybody else in the world doesn't do any  bitcoin transactions).

That is pretty much the big issue/risk with hardforks.
