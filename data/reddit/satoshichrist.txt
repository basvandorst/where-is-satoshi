Aside from price increases, I'm interested in my network of friends having bitcoin so I can trade with them. Have the people you told about it purchased Bitcoin? There's more steps to buy Bitcoin than if someone just gave it to you.

The fees have been tough. Coinbase to coinbase is one (mediocre) solution until lightning network or something like it is available.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:47:51
Good idea. I've been giving away BTC on Facebook too, and didn't think about the fact that they already collect a lot of verification info.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:44:50
Any ideas to make it more scientific, or at least less of a marketing thing? I might include stories of people who've been burned by bitcoin or refuse to use it (and their reasons why).
@_date: 2017-08-17 18:54:19


200000 Satoshi sent. Haha, that last one is great.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:02:02


That's the idea! 200000 Satoshi sent!
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:34:51
Oh! No sign ups or ID collection. I'm talking street-level meeting people in person and giving away Bitcoin. The website would just be to collect donations and share people's stories. The people can be as private or public as they wish to be.
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:14:33
These would be people met in real life. Maybe posting a photo of them holding their QR code, a bit about their occupation and prior knowledge of bitcoin might be cool to know. I can't help much if the person is lying and already has or uses Bitcoin though.

200000 Satoshi sent. Yay Germany.

If people like what I do and find it interesting, maybe they'd donate to the project. Right now I'm just doing it out-of-pocket. Would set up everything with full transparency so people can see where funds go.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:34:51
Hah. To each his own ;)
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:49:54
Just realized I might be breaking rule 2 of this subreddit by giving out BTC in this thread. Anyone want to chime in?

What wallet are you using? It should clear in 10+ minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:13:06
Something like that. Still waiting on confirmation from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:06:45
Coinbase phone support verified it as genuine, just waiting for them to follow up. Very weird.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:39:33
I could also lose 4k if their system thinks I owe them (I don't). Knowing how slow Coinbase support is, it could take a while for me to ever get it back. Just doing due diligence. I've lost 301BTC before so I'm fairly unattached to money these days.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:14:10
Ain't complaining. Just want confirmation they will send BTC on payment.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:43:11
Android malware and/or weak password + No 2FA.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:50:19
Blockchain? Coinbase is a hosted wallet. Here's the transaction though: 
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:14:33
I'd have liked the 50 BTC. I'm a human being trying to pay bills and feed myself, so I can't be totally unattached to financial outcomes. For the record, I stupidly did keep my eggs all in one basket. It was all in cold storage until I started trading the market - got lazy with security and of course was hacked.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:56:03
Agreed. There is the base incentive for holders of BTC, but a good developer fund would be great to incentivize work on next-gen network layers and features.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:52:32
Yep, mostly been giving out $10 each. I also enjoy helping &amp; feeding the homeless, but a lot of them don't have smartphones or a way to transact in BTC. I'm sure that will change in the future, especially with cheap hardware wallets, debit cards, two-way ATMs, merchant adoption, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:29:29
The purchase was made on 8/8/2013. Coinbase JUST notified me a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:05:42
From what I can gather, this completed purchase is 4+ years old. I think they are stretching the meaning of "Recent Buy". =D
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:48:16
No response. It's been four days. I've heard of responses taking much longer.
@_date: 2017-11-24 18:03:41
What's the opposite of a hand clap?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:00:15
Sounds sketchy. I want to base the project around stories. Like  but for Bitcoin newcomers.
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:39:43
UPDATE: The 50 BTC message went away. I guess I'm not on the hook for $5k, but I sure would have liked the bitcoins. Oh well :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:40:49
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:25:27
Hah! Your choice. =)
@_date: 2019-01-28 19:06:12
Should I set a higher price target? There is a [similar idea]( in the traditional world of finance, where rich individuals have pledged to donate half or more of their wealth. Maybe change the percentage amount or price target to get more people to participate?

Thanks. It wasn't the easiest process, but I got it working. Cheers!

No grand conspiracy. I think bitcoin is awesome and will continue to use it, albeit with much more caution. Sometimes smart people do dumb things.
@_date: 2013-11-05 05:18:01
C'est la vie
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:32:48
Hah! I think I might do just that.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:08:25
No, I signed a message on brainwallet.org.
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:04:06
I think it was the email backup. Does the fact that it was "AES encrypted" mitigate the security risk at all?
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:58:48
No, I didn't use a brainwallet. They probably DID log into Blockchain, because all of my addresses with a balance were included in the single transaction.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:02:58
C'est la vie

10 characters with uppercase, lowercase, digits and punctuation.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:40:03
Absolutely. It being so easy though, I wish Blockchain.info would require it by default.
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:55:03
10 characters with uppercase, lowercase, digits and punctuation. I did not have an old / weaker password.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:59:56
Yes, I did have the backup file in my email. This sounds most likely...
@_date: 2017-09-27 11:47:00
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:51:12
I think the "double spend" message is because they sweeped the "correct horse battery staple" brainwallet in the same transaction as my emptied addresses?
@_date: 2013-11-05 04:01:26
Young, single and nothing left to speculate with. Onward.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:56:44
Just use something consumer friendly like Coinbase. Bitcoin is solid... I'm just a dumbass.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:48:49
Thank *you* sir.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:47:37
It really sucks, but frustration and anger won't change anything. They are just digital tokens of wealth allocation - I'll save my grief for the dead.
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:54:52
No, I did not import brainwallet addresses or use Android / Firefox faulty RNG to create my addresses. I think the fuckers just sweeped the "correct horse battery staple" along with my addresses. I'm guessing it's some sort of automated bot or malware.
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:07:55
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:59:24
I don't have the money for a bounty, unless it comes out of recovered funds. Why would I insult blockchain.info when it's my own damn fault?
