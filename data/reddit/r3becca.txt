You're right.
The children are reciting commercial content under instruction from an adult who records the performances and profits from their distribution.
The implied school is fiction and the man isn't a teacher, instead describing his profession as a "review writer" who "will promote anything or any message read it like a teacher.".
The false pretence that these kids are receiving an education rather irks me but on the other hand I love the idea of bitcoin helping entrepreneurs reach global markets with their creative products and services.

Crazier idea:
Create a bounty for FTL travel by transmitting a private wallet key on a high power laser beam across space.
Even crazier idea:
Accompany the bounty with a message explaining the value/function of the wallet in order to provide an economic incentive for peaceful contact and trade should message be detected by an alien intelligence.

Do you know where it is located? Can I visit it now?
I can find plenty of social media posts about them being the first in Syd/Australia but I can't find the actual location of said machine.

Indeed. A fingerprint is comparable to a publicly visible username as far as I'm concerned.

Excellent, now I must ask the obvious question. Does Black Star accept bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-03-27 09:56:18
Cool, thanks :)

The persistent misogyny might have something to do with it.
@_date: 2019-08-19 23:25:58
So fake.
@_date: 2019-02-26 06:02:03
this is nonsense.

Bitpay is a cancer. I'm refusing to jump through bip-70 decoder hacks and straight out boycotting them.

You have been in the bitcoin space long enough to answer that yourself. Why do you think people dislike a manipulative, price gouging, protocol breaking payment gateway that reeks of centralised shitcoin?  
Boycott bitpay.

Many customers with Bitcoin will either refuse to use Bitpay on ethical grounds or will be unable to use Bitpay due to Bitpay's intentionally incompatible payment system. Please use something like BTCpay instead. Bitpay is a bad actor in the Bitcoin community.

Anyone using bitpay should be excluded from this list.
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:14:01
Merchant lists which exclude businesses that rely on Bitpay for Bitcoin transactions would be nice.
I want to spend BTC but I'm firmly boycotting Bitpay due to their unethical practices.

PWM isn't really useful in this context. Perhaps you were thinking of [PID]( as a control mechanism.

I'm not the least bit religious but jebus and btc seemed like a fun mash up resulting in BitChrist; the decentralised deflationary deity.

I recently purchased BTC from BitInnovate.com using the bank cash deposit method and was quite pleased with their service and support. 
@_date: 2013-05-27 02:41:11
[BitChrist]( approves of the name.
@_date: 2013-05-28 23:48:15
Don't shout, mkay.

Bitcoin doesn't *just* deflate though. Bitcoin changes in value due to use, trade, mining and general humans doing stuff with it.
Traditional fiats on the other hand seem much more susceptible to being created in *funny* ways.
That being said, the picture was not the product of or intended to answer a serious argument.
It's all a matter of point of view i suppose. You have a point. :)

I have had positive experiences buying through BitInnovate but only a fraction of the amount you are thinking of investing.
