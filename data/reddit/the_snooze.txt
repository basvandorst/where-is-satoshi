If that happened, you would see a sudden jump in the control group in the revenue-per-visitor chart. It would be like the average net worth in a room full of people spiking up if Bill Gates walked in.

The difference is that a waiter is a representative of a business you're engaging in a tit-for-tat trade. Money is expected in that context. That's not the case in social settings where the currency at play is not money, but unquantifiable favors and approval and emotions. People want to be liked in social interactions, not paid.

That's a possibility. The only reasonable conclusion here is that the presence of that particular link resulted in a 7.5% drop in per-visitor revenue. Anything else is just speculation. They've already indicated that they need to conduct additional testing to narrow down what it is about that link that causes this result.

They weren't comparing results from before the Bitcoin option was offered to after. They were comparing the "donate with Bitcoin" version of the page to the original one (without that option) over the same exact time period. Both versions were live at the same time, and the A/B testing suite randomly presents one or another to each user. This ensures that both variants received extra visitors equally, so hype confers no advantage to one or another.

The problem is that tipping is going to be perceived as a monetary transaction (because it most definitely is), and that perception changes social expectations from a cordial interpersonal context to a strict business one. [Attempting to mix the two is often disastrously offensive]( Forcing money -- especially in trivial amounts -- in social contexts will make people feel like suckers and prostitutes.

So if I understand this correctly, the split starts at 50/50 but is dynamically adjusted as results come in because you're still running a real live fundraiser and you don't want to expose yourself to a loser too much or to a winner too little. The large sample sizes and the use of the revenue-per-visitor metric reduce the effect the dynamic weighting may have on the outcome (but probably not eliminate it completely). Is that right?

The "donate with Bitcoin" version of the site was being served at the same time as the original one without the link. The A/B testing suite randomly displays one or the other to a visitor. They're comparing the site to another version of itself over the same exact time period, which means they're both under the same effect of the hype, so there's no net effect of the publicity in one or the other. There's a larger volume of visitors, yes, but they're randomly presented with one version of the site or the other. Any performance differences can only be attributed to the single change between the two: the presence of the "donate with Bitcoin" notice.

Glad to see you fielding questions on this thread. It's probably really obvious to someone who knows stats better than I do, but I don't get why you guys didn't do a 50/50 randomization between your control and treatment groups. Can you clarify that for me?

I don't see how that's relevant to what I said: more often than not, money and social interactions don't mix because it changes the tenor and expectations. ChangeTip's primary use case goes against common social expectations. The linked article says this. Dan Ariely's behavioral economics research supports this.

Because the treatment group (i.e., the one with the Bitcoin option) is larger than the control group; nearly double the size, in fact. The larger group will obviously have a higher total because it's larger. You need to normalize the two groups by factoring out the effects of the size difference, hence the comparison using the revenue-per-visitor metric.
Consistency from Saturday onward is the result of the "donate with Bitcoin" hype dying down and the donations falling back to normal levels.

That's really disingenuous wording. You make it sound like the government would have just wiped out everyone's retirement savings for shits and giggles. In reality, they would have just put it under different management because investment banks were a dumpster fire at the time. Read your own damn article (which by the way is editorial tripe barfed out by the John Locke Foundation pretending to be legitimate journalism).
In *real* reality, this proposal never got off the ground. It's about as serious and realistic as splitting up California that comes up every few years.
