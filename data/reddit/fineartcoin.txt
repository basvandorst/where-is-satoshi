Using reverse image search, it appears to be legit. Curious how you rendered it... using Blender?

Would be also great to include more artwork as a part of the experience, and for people to not only donate but to get a print it original! I've been working on setting up online galleries to accept Bitcoin at

A QR code to a website, and then accepting Bitcoin would be a good way to make the donation gets to the right place!

Privacy for both merchant and customer. There is one less third-party that potentially personally-identifiable information needs to be shared to handle a transaction. It's not easy to identify all customers passively, and likewise not easy to identify all purchases of a customer if unique addresses are used correctly. There is also less liability on the merchant for securing private financial information, since all authorization takes place at the customers side and no private financial information is sent to the merchant.

This also depends upon the merchant you make payment to, because yes your address can be link to you, however the address of the merchant make not be very easily link to the merchant. Many services will reuse addresses, which will make it possible for those addresses to be associated to the merchant upon their reuse. There is an option in [Bitcoin Payments for WooCommerce]( to be able to disable reusing addresses.

For transactions under 0.01 BTC without a fee might take a very long time for the transaction to be included in the blockchain, however. So it's not recommended.

I know you can see the amount sent to an address using getreceivedbyaddress, is it possible to get a transaction to an address before it gets included in the blockchain?

As far as I understand, it is recommended to use a unique bitcoin address for each invoice, for improved anonymity and privacy. Associating a human readable value for a machine value such as the DNS system wouldn't help privacy of transactions. However, using a URL such as blockexample.com/invoice123 that has a QR code, the bitcoin address, and the amount requested, would provide the human readable aspect while still having privacy.

Fees are optional, and larger fees speed up the time it takes for a transaction to be included in the blockchain. Here is how the priority is calculated: 
Different wallets will automatically include a fee and you can usually adjust it.

Keys could be a more useful metaphor than physical coins.

Must be, there was a post about it a year ago:
