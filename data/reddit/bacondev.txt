Time and time again, the voting system proves to have some flaws. Many people on the frontpage, don't seem to check the subreddit when voting.

Really? I had a similar thing happen to me less than a month ago and they cleared it up.
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:54:35
IIRC, the $300 limit only applies to credit/debit cards. ACH transactions have a higher limit. You can also get your limit bumped up after a fair bit of problem-free trading with them.

It's almost like the website was created for profit.
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:51:38
But I have to wait when using Coinbase since they are very strict on which cards they accept for instant transactions.

Who said anything about being charged extra for paying with Bitcoin?
If people are willing to pay more for that convenience, then I don't see the problem with the company both saving money and earning more money. But IMHO, they're not even saving money. They're only making more money. The customers are going to pay to receive their ticket(s) regardless of the method. One is just more expensive than the other.
Could the company offer the instant option for free or at least for cheaper? Sure. I can see how one might be upset that they don't. The company realizes that their customers don't want to wait for the tickets to come in the mail. But personally, I understand that the company needs to make a profit so that they can continue offering the service and I don't mind paying extra for immediacy.

This isn't about Bitcoins in any way. This doesn't belong here.
@_date: 2014-10-09 20:22:15
That's a question for your bank.
@_date: 2014-05-16 01:38:53
As far as I'm concerned, the value of EUR is not based on the value of USD.

As d1str0 said, it's instant upon email verification.

I would imagine that the FBI merchants only sell in large quantities so that they can bust the dealers since busting simple users is more or less a waste of resources.
@_date: 2015-05-23 18:44:46

Do it! I'm sure there's plenty of Bitcoin in it for you.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:16:57
Have you bought any Bitcoins through them yet?

Perhaps he is serious. But there is no way that he didn't know that such a blog post would make the value tank.

Using RES, you can turn off the subreddit style via the checkbox in the sidebar. I disable subreddit styles on any subreddit that is overbearing on reddit functionality (looking at you, subreddits that hide downvote buttons).
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:45:54
I regard to the second sentence, do you realize that you're agreeing with the wiki?


@_date: 2015-08-05 19:35:08
What are some good alternatives? I don't recall seeing any suggested in the past few threads about this.

I just verified your signature and was pleasantly surprised to discover that you have a website complete with merchandise.

Ah. That's what I suspected but was in too much doubt to check. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-02-04 20:47:01
Just checked. Nope. :(
@_date: 2015-11-24 05:17:16
It depends on how reddit sells user information.
@_date: 2015-10-19 04:10:57
Honest question: How is that fraud?

I blame this on EDIT: /sarcasm
@_date: 2013-07-10 05:48:02
So, uh, how many does it need?
@_date: 2013-06-20 02:12:32
Does that affect one's credit?
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:28:02
You're supposed to pay for that?
EDIT: I thought that was WinZip.

Not now VideoLinkBot.

You're talking about Bitcoin and regulation in the same sentence. You do realize that, right?

There are very few uses of Java in browsers. Whenever there is a use for it, Flash is often used instead. But yeah, HTML 5 + JavaScript is *usually* the best choice, but you as the user hardly ever have the choice.

Don't even number them either. A pig is just "pig". A cow is just "cow".

I know you're joking, but I feel the need to point out that attackers will likely want his site to stay up so that when their attack hits, it's more visible.

I would gladly do so if I could find a damn working chart.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:49:06
From the sidebar:


@_date: 2013-04-18 15:48:29
The live chart is working, but since there are no transactions it might as well be down.

I moved from BTC-e to CampBX today. While I was not as satisfied with interface, I was incredibly satisfied with the ease of transferring USD to and from it. 0% withdraw to Dwolla? Sign me up.

This doesn't belong here. This belongs in somewhere like (though everybody including its readers hates that subreddit anyway)
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:05:04
You should think in terms of percentages.

Please tell me this is IE.

Yes, it is. I use it when programming. It's the default font for [Sublime Text](

This has nothing to do with Bitcoins. As per the sidebar, "news articles that do not contain the word 'Bitcoin' are usually off-topic. This subreddit is not about general financial news. Submissions that are mostly about some other cryptocurrency belong elsewhere.".
No, this is not a news article, but it still does not have the word "Bitcoin" anywhere in it (not even in the title). And it's about different currencies (though not cryptocurrencies). This doesn't belong here.

I would if MtGox would let me withdraw my Bitcoins already. :(
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:11:50
Because the value of Bitcoins fluctuates much more than that of the USD.

Why don't you just make 10 mean more?

Yup, we just now made it to the second page.

I'm not at all surprised. Just pissed. I've been trying to get my money of there ever since I put my money in there (newb mistake). But no, my account is pending verification. I can give them all of the money I want but god forbid I withdraw a little over two bitcoins.
