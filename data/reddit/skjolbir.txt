Fuck you. The US makes you pay taxes when you live abroad. That is parasitic as fuck.

You can move anywhere and you still gotta pay the US taxes, because the US is a parasite.

So your answer is to create a speculative bubble? BTC will never make it mainstream if the value is artificially rising because the entire communities mentality is a speculative bubble.

Here I am with £2 in my account and moving back to my parents.       
I don’t kick myself for not buying at &lt;$ because it was just a cool thing to read about. I do regret not buying at £400 when I could afford 10 coins.

How many citizens have water with heavy metal contamination? We all heard about Flint, but that wasn’t an isolated case now was it...
@_date: 2018-05-30 12:09:17
The explosion to 19k was down to bitcoins first widescale public exposure though, that was a spike caused by an event.            
What is the next event going to be to cause a spike again, and when are we going to stop spiking and falling due to events and see a stable price.

Imagine being a first world country with clean drinking water issues though lmao
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:28:22
Clean tap water is pretty fundamental though. I feel if it wasn’t your country, you wouldn’t defend such a state of affairs as much.
@_date: 2018-05-24 12:29:31
Yeah, thats what happens when crypto goes from near total obscurity to public knowledge. I don't know why you are citing that as a projection for the future. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:54:21
Fair enough.

As opposed to btc fanatics who scream "See I told you btc would rise, this is great news" or "Btc dip, time to buy, this is great news".            
I'm not bothered you call me out for being skeptical. To you that might seem an insult, to me it seems pretty fine.

We’ll be hearing this kind of thing said all the way down to $100
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:59:09
Who is to say bitcoin will hold value is 20 years though. I could drop £30,000 into bitcoin today, and come next year maybe it settles at only 1/10th if today’s value for good. Until the value has settled and is stable, it’s stupid to invest long term for any reason other than market speculation.
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:46:36
This early in the intoduction of crypto to the world, events are most important. Events such as wide public exposure, brick and mortar stores allowing payments, banks and other large institutions adopting crypto and I am sure many others.             
We have a lot of events that can happen that will spike and settle crypto at a higher value every time, but none of them are certain to happen.                  
It will be a long time yet before the value of cryptocurrency has been through it all and matured, until then we are all guessing. 
@_date: 2018-05-17 13:00:34
Can you imagine being charged just to use a bank lmaooo
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:46:58
Was gonna say...          
UK citizen here. No charge for withdrawals. No charge for payments. No charge for even having money in the bank, I actually get paid interest (even though rn its fuck all).              
&amp;nbsp;         
And actually, this meme applies more to bitcoin in my case. Costs to move fiat into btc. Costs to pay with btc. Costs to move back to fiat.

@_date: 2018-07-10 13:21:49
Hit the nail on the head with my direction there.      
Within wifi islands (great analogy there by the way, kudos) its a system that works wonderfully.         
         
&amp;nbsp;          
I am uncertain how well ISPs would fare in the future if their only job is to connect islands. In that case however, with a much smaller role to play, I actually could see government play the role of connecting islands; a small increase in tax to provide a much smaller infrastructure role suits gov more than providing an entire internet infrastructure with nationalisation. At the same time, I'm uncertain connecting islands would be a profitable business endeavour and who to charge and how much would be wildly unpredictable.           
&amp;nbsp;         
I am very unconvinced there are incentives for general citizens to connect islands though, given the cost of either laying wire or basically their own cell phone towers.          
&amp;nbsp;      
Another consideration, ping. I would like to know how ping would be affected by bouncing through thousands of nodes to get from point A to point B across a long distance. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 14:41:57

@_date: 2018-07-10 12:16:23
Makes sense.         
So this hypothetical super wifi, where is the incentive for users to foot a much larger energy bill to provide a super wifi when most of the time they will only need it within their homes ect at the ranges we see now?           
Obviously in cities there are huge amounts of low-range wifi you could bounce around, but what about out in the country? Why would someone living way out there want to invest in super wifi mostly for use of people just passing through?             
Idk man, I think I can give a pass for *future technology* existing, but I am unconvinced on the marketability of it.
@_date: 2018-07-10 12:41:22
My apologies, I didn't realise you were not the original user I replied to who used the term super-wifi, anyway...          


        
So before I continue, are we assuming a hypothetical situation where we as market of consumers can ditch ISP's and their cable networks in favour of decentralised wifi only?

Bullshit lmao. I would be surprised if we beat our last peak for a long time. Honeymoon period has come and gone, everyone heard of btc and wanted in, price rose while they bought in then when it popped as expected they all freaked out and Sodl. They people wont be back for a long while.

How can bitcoin ever topple ISPs? I don't see it ever happening. They own the wire, the fiber, the exchanges, they can literally just cut you off.          
And without them having customers, who will maintain the broadband infrastructure? The government? I would not trust the internet infrastructure to my government in a hundred years, they are slow and incompetent.

Only other guy I know who has an opinion on it thinks its a bum investment. I hold out hope in the real longterm for crypto, I don't think its going away because its here and its useful. I don't see where the jump from 10k to 1000k is though.

Extremely casual bitcoin observer here; can someone explain how bitcoin will ever be an everyday trading currency when its value has such gigantic jumps and sinks over such a short time. It doesn't seem stable enough.
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:08:12


             
This is exactly why I don't expect another bullrush for a while. I don't see anyone using crypto as a currency, everyone is Hodl'ing. Where is the incentive for the average Joe to buy in. If you google crypto now, one of the biggest news events was the rise and crash. People don't look at it and see a gold standard yet, they see a volatile commodity.
