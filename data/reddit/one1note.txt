Is China losing faith in the YUAN?

Good points you're making. Some are technically solvable, some are not.
I'm also worried about the fact that losing a private key means losing your acquisitions. You are not protected against bugs in wallet software or whatever. 
A couple months ago a redditor lost over 40k worth of BTC because of a system failure, the lost coins are still in the wallet. He was contemplating suicide.

Bitcoin would be of my least worries, when that happens.

It had nothing to do with back-ups. It was a system fault, which generated a private key but didn't assign it properly.

Enjoy your first bitcoins. Many to come for your generation!

To put it simple. There is currently more demand for bitcoin, so the price automatically  adjusts to demand/supply.

Got your 0.02 B?

Selling it on Localbitcoins is an option..

Where do you get stuck in the process? Is it getting the app to work or with transactions?

It's real. I noticed it today while driving.
