I would love if that were true. How do I convert it to USD then, won't I need a bank?

Definitions of User, Exchanger, and Administrator
This guidance refers to the participants in generic virtual currency arrangements, using the terms "user," "exchanger," and "administrator."6 A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services.7 An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. An administrator is a person engaged as a business in issuing (putting into circulation) a virtual currency, and who has the authority to redeem (to withdraw from circulation) such virtual currency.

Does that make me the Administrator if I am mining?

Here's the actual message from IACFU:
So the latest to maintain compliance with the regulations,  we need to make sure you have 3 things on file.   I listed them below with the reasons  - personally I hate when people do not explain themselves.   This is a dialog and we try to be as transparent as possible. 
1) Registration with NJ to do business in New Brunswick or Highland park NJ.  This is done on line and relatively simple.  This is to comply with our field of membership rules.
2) Register with Fincenn.  This is to comply with federal law.
3) Get at least one MTL from any state.   This is because while we have federal charter and do not engage in bit coin exchanges to USD you do and as administrator need a lisc.  If you are consulting counsel the reference is: 18 USC 1960.
We are trying to do our best to serve the community and best way we know how is stay within guidelines and not get ourselves shut down.   If you have a legal opinion that you do not have one of the three please forward it on and I will be happy to share it with our general counsel.

To operate the business I think I'll need a bank account. I'm not sure how I could get around that
