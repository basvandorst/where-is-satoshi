From the website, this is an interesting perspective on parking, "Parking is for everyone, not just the spoiled drivers who can throw away money on a prime spot. Making the process cheaper means giving everyone a chance!"
How does this service make parking cheaper? This service adds an extra cost to parking. You still have to feed the meter right? If  the spot is non-metered then you are paying so you don't have to drive around searching for a spot - but you have taken that spot from someone else. So now they drive around search for a spot.

The whole article leads up to an advertisement for a $10 downloadable game? Not exactly thinly-veiled product placement.

It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense

What is the markup that these vendors put on the giftcards? In the end, how much does a $100 Amazon gift card really cost? $105?

How can companies accept payment through Bitcoin "instantly" if it takes about 10 minutes for a transaction to be confirmed one time in the blockchain?

If you stir that latte it will look like a frappuccino. Take it back to the MtGox counter and say, "I ordered a latte and you gave me a frappuccino!" They will give you a second latte!

If this were posted in people would take the idea and run with it. They would then brainstorm to work out the details together. If there is enough support in the community then it would happen. built 2 fresh water wells in Kenya, sent the Jamaican bobsled team to the Olympics, and sponsored a NASCAR all starting with a fairly abstract original post and then the community worked out the details together.
