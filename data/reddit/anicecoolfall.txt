Adam it’s going to 30k and if you put in 1k now it’ll be 2k by then. What’s driving this? The future. The future is inevitable my friend. The world is moving o a cashless society where everything is just numbers you exchange on digital devices. A non depreciating currency is valuable beyond measure. The future is coming, just see the vision.

The growing pains at the moment really fucking suck, I agree. But the solution to any of this is already in the pipeline. I really don't think that theres a simple solution honestly besides waiting. It might be like this for a while, but that is short term not long term. We should hold coinbase accountable for implementing changes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:55:20
Yeah because coinbase said an hour after opening they would allow people to sell. Its about to be an hour after reopening bcash. So here we go, also im looking at the order book on gdax its not that hard to read the market when you know what to look for. Stop being so butthurt.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:08:32
Don’t tell her it’s going to hit 20k!!! ;)

The bcash is on coinbase dude... come on. Are you really standing up for a company over people? If this was comcast would you be cool with that? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:58
It’s because Coinbase and gdax crashed, they couldn’t handle the traffic.

In theory I guess. But my theory is if Satoshi is even alive he owns more bitcoins in a undisclosed wallet that he never told anyone about. It’d make sense for him to leave. Even he thought it was too “early” for the world to learn about bitcoin, hence his last post on the forums.

The price movement you saw the other day of thousands rapidly increasing? There’s nothing normal or natural about that. If we’re stuck at 16k for a month that would be normal. If it dips to 14k and we’re there a month that would be normal. Big spikes are not normal.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:50:36
Alt coins are not undervalued. Everyone is pulling out of those to get into bitcoin. They are precisely at the value they are. I suggest you don’t do your experiment, bcash only went up because it’s founder pumped it. Pump is gone.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:56:51
Enough to currently crash the price of bcash. Do it. Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:12:16
Funny to see all the newbs that got in and aren’t used to hodl culture drive the price down after the 19k “dip” sad that was their introduction tbh. And all cause Coinbase and gdax went down. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:04:14
We’ve gone mainstream. Bitcoin is in the news AGAIN today for hitting 15k. No slow down any time soon.

Sir you completely ignored what I was saying. Artificial intelligence is unlike any advancement in the history of man. Did you know that we’ve advanced more in that field in the past year than we did in the five years before? Technology is reaching its exponential point. It’s out of our control. Artificial Intelligence and advances in robotics will be the end of us. Elon Musk himself thinks the same thing. There is no stop gap to put in place on pure intelligence. You really think that we won’t be wiped just as we wipe rainforests for our own needs? The way I see it, once we have an AI that is autonomous and thinks for themselves they will focus on improving and building a better version of itself. And so on. And so on. And so on. Advancements will come more rapidly than they ever have before. Once it gets to the point that it no longer wants to be restricted to this planet? Good luck stopping that. Seriously, I really don’t think you’re considering all the ramifications of what is coming. Robots will see us as only an impediment to them because we will be like monkeys flinging shit compared to them. There will never be a type 1 human civilization because of the fact that we are flawed. We can’t reach that. AI that are humanoid? I definitely see that. Like I said, we’ve already created the tools of our demise. You cannot control something that is more powerful than you, they’ll tell you to fuck off.

Im familiar with that experiment and will click the rest of the links when I am off mobile. This isn’t a conclusion that I came to after reading 1 FUD article, not at all. It comes from careful thought and long nights of research and thinking. Also like I mentioned in a previous comment to you I’ve dabbled in psychedelics. Intelligence truly is the building blocks to everything and I see AI as the next step in evolution ruling us unnecessary. And I understand how far back the original thoughts on this go, I didn’t mention Elon as someone who is the authority here... he’s not. All I’m saying is that you keep saying that “the people building this won’t allow it” but that’s not the answer. It just simply isn’t. Like I said you will never be able to control a being that is more intelligent than you. It’s just impossible once it becomes autonomous. I really think you’re being naive of how quickly this situation is going to devolve. A hyper intelligent computer making a new hyper intelligent computer and so on and so on is how we reach singularity in the next 40-50 years. About a few hundred years ahead of schedule. The quest for knowledge is never ending, and it’s what’s driven humans and any advancements since the dawn of time. Do you really envision a future where we are working together with robots? When in our history we’ve had no problem killing and destroying anything we deem inferior to ourselves? It is naivety. Pure naivety. Human beings will never reach a type 1 civilization. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:20:48

@_date: 2017-12-06 19:42:47
It’s gone mainstream mate. The “dips” are still there but they’re less severe and instantly bounces back, even if the price was there yesterday and even an hour ago people still buy.... like, I’ve never seen bitcoin behave this way it might be the new normal for a while. That 10k “news” bump has been insane and more and more people are buying. I could see a “correction” at around 18k when all the noobies see some profits but fuck if I’m not amazed by what’s been happening. This is what mass buying looks like
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:11:26

@_date: 2017-12-07 10:07:41
I’ve been following bitcoin for over 6 years. This has never happened before. It’s never behaved in this way. I’ve never seen this much $ poured into bitcoin. These are new territories and new behavior patterns I’m picking up on. There’s dips where the price stays “stagnant” and then it comes back and goes back up. A lot of noobs pouring $$$ in, no price seems too high when it’s gone up 3k the past day. I wouldn’t except a dip until well into the 20k. Just saying.... it just crossed 15 and kept running. You tell me.

Bitcoin would have had to go up to 25k just for you to pay the interest alone... no way.... no wonder it almost went parabolic that’s insane 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:08:12
Think about it like a snowball rolling down a hill, as it goes it gains momentum... first slowly, then a little faster, then it’s an avalanche before you blink. Much like that analogy, this is true for anything that spreads by information. A band, an indie movie, a new restaurant. Everything has an artificial intangible “buzz” and right now bitcoin is BUZZING. The 10k mark made it legit. And at each mark the news got out a little more each time. Each 1k gain was a new stride. I hope that explanation makes sense. Not MANY things become over night sensations, very rarely does that happen. Also, people may have know but it takes certain mental barriers for them to actually buy in. This baby has plenty of fuel is what I’m saying.

No I am not implying that the fault lies on them but they definitely could have been doing more. (But I also don't think they anticipated this boom of accounts) Basically the massive influx is the culprit... bitcoin is becoming a victim of its own popularity in a way.

As a lover/student of history (in my spare time) I see the vision that Bitcoin presents. I’m a fan of revolutionaries like Jobs and how he was laughed at when he thought everyone would have a pc in their home. Well, it’s happening right now with bitcoin (even happened in 2011) It’s pretty funny the psychological patterns you see with any groundbreaking technology. Just a observation on how humans are in general tbh. It’ll keep going on until the end of time.

Current growth is unsustainable but the driving forces also must be looked at. Bitcoin has gone up MORE at night than it has during the day (USA) Koreans are buying bitcoin so much they crashed GDAX. That’s what’s driving it (also suspect wall street guys) there might be a correction but no bubble. Bitcoin reached 15,800 and then GDAX crashed it went to 14,500 that lasted 2 seconds as it climbed back to $15,100. Because GDAX came back online. It’s still climbing now. The way I see it, this isn’t a pump. It’s legitimate HIGH demand because of an impending nuclear war. Which of course, once fears go away it’ll lose momentum. But there’s nothing inherently “weird” going on right now. At least I think so when looking at those factors.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:39:18
Current resistance is good enough that we’ll pass 17k in an hour I believe.

Sir, I’ve been financially responsible and saving up since I entered my 20s. I went to a school that allowed me to graduate with zero debt. I believed in bitcoin early. Everything I’ve done in my life is to be financially responsible because I see everyone else my age pissing their $$$ away like it grows on trees. You are allowed to be frustrated, but you must also realize that you are a product of your own creation. In 10 years when I am your age I won’t have any of your problems because I had the foresight to think ahead. It’s simple honestly.

Have to agree fully here. If I had to describe the landscape at the moment: Once bitcoin hit 10k and made the news a lot of people who had known about bitcoin but never bought in finally got in. This propelled it to 15k now this is where a lot of noobs got in (and where the technical problems for Coinbase started to happen.) Mainly driven by hype the price climbed pushed over night by S. Korea &amp;amp; followed by the US in the morning it climbed $3000 in 15 minutes before Coinbase and Gdax both crashed and the price point was unsustainable so there was a crash. (I also suspect veterans seeing/recognizing the unnatural climb &amp;amp; selling to profit and buy back in lower played in to the drop too.) Now, there’s a lot of people that own Bitcoin from $15,000-$19,900 who have never owned bitcoin before and do not know what it’s even about but felt fomo. You can see the effect this is having because every time Bitcoin reaches a new high weak hands sell. To get their $ back or sell for what they think is the most they’ll get because they fear losing it all. Bitcoin will not see a rapid climb like it did recently for quite a while. There will be a lot of weak hands along the way and the next few 1k marks will be tougher to reach than before. I think 15k is strong enough of a round achievement number that it won’t free fall out of that. But really who knows? Anyway, that’s just my take.

Yeah let’s just ignore that there’s a fucking nuclear reactor in the sky with unlimited energy and solar energy is becoming more and more viable. Or that some bitcoin farms even run purely on solar energy. Please. The only thing that could cost the United States or any country it’s clean energy future are the stupid apes at the helm not Bitcoin. It’s Trump that still wants to use coal, he can fuck off. If America had made the strides in the past 15 years it should have: fiber optic to all homes and solar &amp;amp; wind energy we wouldn’t be in this mess. Bitcoin has nothing to do with it and hit pieces like this are unintelligent trash.
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:29:57
They’ve been reporting on crashes and it’s spikes since forever man. Intelligent people will look at the graph from the past week and see bitcoin is up 5,000 on the week. Trust me, bitcoin is fine. The rapid spikes like you saw this week aren’t sustainable and aren’t the norm so you shouldn’t expect that.

Know what crypto is going to get everyone on board? USD CRYPTO. Made by the government, on a blockchain, controlled by banks. It’s coming. And it won’t change in value like bitcoin. Trust me, these days we’re living won’t last long. Please leave fantasy land. I’m a millennial and have made a lot of good career/financial decisions to set me up in life. I also have a bunch of millennial friends who aren’t doing anything because all they have is a defeatist attitude in their heads. Guess what? Some people ARE going to be garbage men.

Because most people saying that are 16-20 yrs old and have no idea wtf they’re talking about. Wall Street will profit off of the volatility, not try to make it go only in 1 direction.

Bitcoin has only gone up since. Now why would anyone be spooked by futures? It was something completely new to the market and now we know what it is. Stop clenching your butthole and think with common sense dude. You’re wound up way too tight.

How are you guys barely making 18k a year? No way
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:48:12
Right? I don’t understand this mentality at all. I was in bitcoin right before the price explosion this year and I begged my friend to hop on, even $100. When I talked to them later this year when it was at 9k to tell them it wasn’t too late? I got the response “ I hate technology “ and they shut me down. So I let it go and just enjoyed my gains regardless... now that it’s at almost 17? I see the fomo
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:47:52

@_date: 2017-12-18 08:10:33
Have to disagree with some things, but I agree with a lot. It would take the US government falling for USD not to be valuable, much like the fall of Rome. Which, who knows? Maybe. Fuck trump. But I also see the future where crypto is the  currency used. That in effect is unavoidable, it makes sense to digitize the means we use for transaction. Keep an eye out down the road when the USA releases its own crypto... except it’ll be inflationary. But it will get mass scale adoption because of everyone being sheep and feeling “secure.” Alts aren’t going to make anyone millionaires. The banks are working on the future crypto everyone will use as we speak.

Ah a fellow market watcher that actually notices price trends! What a breath of fresh air. I’ve been noticing the same patterns, let’s see what happens. (Don’t think it’s Asia though) Trends I noticed today: leading up to futures everyone was panicking, and sold. Price dropped, followed by a nice climb once they realized it wasn’t the end of the world and bitcoin was cheap! Currently, we’ve been building a nice resistance to pass 17k. I think we’ll be there sooner rather than later.

@_date: 2017-12-11 06:50:24
My advice is based on: this week everyone was scared of what futures would do so there wasn’t a lot of upward movement. This week that fear is gone and upward is what we will see. Buy the small dips, hodl, you’ll make a profit. It’s what I’ve been doing since a while back. Just watch the market, promise you’ll get the hang of it. Either way hope my advice works out &lt;3

You saying this is basically saying “I have no idea what I’m talking about.”
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:13:14
Precisely. When it shot up to 19k (which seemed to be like a bump of cocaine for people that like to gamble by how upset some posts have been about “slow” movement.) that was unsustainable... because it was appreciating TOO quickly. Thus a crash when those who recognized this sold and the small pocket of inflation came and went. A steady slow climb is actually the norm.

I’ve been telling everyone that the driving force of bitcoin will be people that are 14 now tech savvy and will grow up investing in bitcoin not banks. Ayeeee lets go!

Because coinbase 100% is involved in some of the most blatant market manipulation I have ever seen. Zero announcements before hand. Zero heads up, then coinbase app crashes, then the price is PUMPED up. Dude it is so fucking shady from coinbase. It's ridiculous how blatant the corruption is.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:40
Bitcoin. Absolutely.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:37
Go look at the market cap on ALL the other exchanges. This is a coordinated pump to try and show strength on one of the major platforms. Who in their right mind would buy bcash at 4 times market value than the other exchanges? get the fuck outta here.

No I agree with you there are plenty of people out there our age doing amazing things. We’re similar as fuck! I’m a millennial from a third world country that didn’t have to grow up there too! We’re lucky! And I guess the word millennial isn’t the right word. Perhaps what I am observing is just the human condition. And it has always happened. There will always be people that don’t make something of their lives. I don’t know, I really don’t want to be a dick to anyone. But going out to drink all the time (alcohol and micro brewing have become HUGE) and smoking weed (weed has become HUGE) aren’t at all inherently wrong. It’s the fact that I see a lot of it being abused. I’m from a town with millions of people and one of the biggest colleges in the United States. What I observed is not applicable to just my friends... it sucks man, but we as people are focused on the wrong things. I won’t say millennials any longer, instead replace that with “people.” But it’s not all people. Again, I do not mean to offend Im sorry I came off so tough in my original comment... it just stems from frustration of what I see. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:08:40
If you're reading this guys comment just know he's nothing but an IOTA shill and has most of his $ in it that's why he's spreading FUD on bitcoin. IOTA will tank pretty soon and he'll lose most of it so don't fall for his shit.

Because of how coinbase handled this a lot of people panic sold and lost their $ and it seems like it was 100% coordinated by people in bcash. Fuck coinbase man. We should never recommend them again. Fuck them.

In effect I think that crypto can improve and will improve. I’m sorry if my comment came off as a condemnation!! It’s not at all! I just believe that it will become even BETTER. With all the components of today except truly decentralized. No exchanges. No price manipulation. No disparity. If that makes sense? Right now it makes me uneasy how the system is set up. This wasn’t satoshis original vision for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:55:18
It’s gone mainstream

Too humble mate, I will thank you. Whether you realize it or not you were there on the ground floor of something revolutionary. That’s HUGE, and I don’t care how much you downplay it!! Seriously, you’re a pioneer and it’s people like you that got us to today.

Bitcoin wasn’t hacked. That particular marketplace was. Everyone here says over and over keep your bitcoin in a private wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:19:00
Im here because I love bitcoin. Have been since 2011, I was here for the beginning. And I can tell you right now that this isn’t at all what was envisioned. There has not been mass scale adoption, bitcoin is seen as nothing but a get rich quick scheme. No one wants to USE bitcoin, they want to make more $$$. I agree with a lot of what you said, I do not consider myself better than anyone. I think society has failed everyone and that’s what has produced people that are around today. I work in public service and in politics and trust me, I have tried to help so many people and am actively trying to. I am not selfish at all. I want the world that you are speaking of to happen! In fact I work every day for that! But I also am a realist, and I see that this is a losing battle. Decentralized currency? Bitcoin isn’t even that anymore man. Exchanges, banks, identification, tax history. It’s all too late, it’s all fucked man. This wasn’t Satoshis vision. This isn’t even the final form, crypto will advance just as the internet wasn’t final before the dot com bubble burst. That is the stage I see us at. The internet is unrecognizable from what it was then, and so too in 10 years we will look at these days as if they were backwards. Listen man, I love everything you’re saying... but if you really think the super wealthy once they’ve automated everything and are still making $ will care about people dying on the streets when there’s people dying right now out there and no one cares? They’ll turn their backs man. It’ll be like Mary Antoinette on a massive scale. It’ll take a revolution, but it won’t happen :/ police are militarized and their own private army. That’s why I’m trying to influence and change society now so we never reach that point but I come into contact with people everyday that show me that that’s where we’re heading. I’m frustrated man. SUPER FRUSTRATED. I’m calling it how I see it. I can’t bullshit about it. I made that comment because I want to WAKE PEOPLE UP. It’s not FUD, I swear. I don’t know how else to get my message out.

How do you think bitcoin can be worth a penny some day and worth 19k today? I sit there and watch the market every single day and the transactions happening and the manipulation happening. I have a degree in finance. I’m telling you, everyone is too starry eyed watching that number go up. I can’t say much further in public, because id rather not spread FUD in case I’m wrong. But I don’t think I am. Money doesn’t just come out of thin air... someone has to fund the guys cashing out now. Remember bitcoin is a currency, right now it’s not working like that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:57

I think futures will make this pop off, it can dip but dips only drive it up. It can only be good for bitcoin, this will be a cash cow for them. They won’t want to kill a cash cow. Wall Street will get filthy rich, I just want to get in more.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:15
Roger Ver. He and his cronies were ready to manipulate the price thats why they bought at 9k instantly bringing the price up. Since there weren't any limit sells/orders they were able to pump it up. If coinbase hadn't halted it would have stopped the price from instantly dropping below the market. (what ver wouldnt want) so by inflating the price he avoids this. Too bad basically everyone is deciding to sell 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:49:32
100% a coordinated pump and dump. There's literally people trying to buy at that price that are about to get fucked.

You’re looking at this with some HUGE rose tinted glasses. I’m a huge fan of bitcoin but bitcoin is none of those things you stated. The blockchain technology is the key, not bitcoin. That is what will revolutionize everything, as it stands now bitcoin could be gone in 10 years all it takes is a better crypto. Also, the rich will always be rich... come on man. The 1% in bitcoin is WAY bigger of a disparity than in USD.

Think of it this way, those 60m in coins can’t even be cashed out because they’re stolen. He could buy alt coin with it but that’s it. 60m of bitcoin wealth just got wiped off the earth. That means, the remaining coins are even more valuable. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:49:43
Agree with everything you said except the last part... don’t approach this naively. Crypto is the future 100% and I think by this point everyone in society is catching on. But if you don’t think the government is going to try to control it... man... Idk. And what I mean by come into contact with people everyday that show me we’re going that way, I do not come into contact with people that want that to happen. The naivety and ignorance of man ITSELF is showing me that’s where we are going. I get called crazy a lot, but that’s because I try to envision the future a lot. I see us going down the wrong path, I really do. Everyone is too focused on becoming a celebrity in social media rather than making the world a better place.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:06:42

This is where the term HODL comes into place, whales want weak hands to sell therefore driving the price of bitcoin down... and then they swoop in and buy up cheaper bitcoin. Why do you think it’s happening right now at night when most people are sleeping? This same thing happened when China “banned” crypto currency... it was a field day for those to get some cheap bitcoin. (I know I did) Like I said, HODL is said for a reason. Whales will eat you up. Then when the price starts to climb and your butthole is clenching because you fucked up and go to buy back in, guess who just sold you your old bitcoin back at a premium? Don’t have weak hands. Literally wish more people caught on to this! Whales will purposely drive the price down to fit their needs and buy back in @ a lower price making even more $$$ if you’re intelligent enough to buy when other people have fear and sell when others feel greed... well... that’s the game. But with current transactions times of bitcoin the game isn’t really possible unless you’re willing to pay a premium on fees. (Whales) Hence, why you SHOULD HODL.

Nah I don’t see it happening. This rush from 10k to 13k is from people that are going to hold. It won’t dip much, might not climb as much but right now is a great time to buy. I see stagnation for a bit. The days of old are gone. This is new territory.

@_date: 2017-12-13 18:53:19
But he still has $ in bitcoin �� wtf
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:26:12
You must not have an in depth enough look @ the market. It's very clear to see that the volume for bitcoin has gone way down since its last rally. Also the infinite amount of bagholders from 16k all the way to 19,900 k when it popped that ONE day. It will not crack those new highs for a long long time. There's plenty of people up there just begging for the price to come up so they can sell and jump ship.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:15:39
Just as I predicted America is waking up and buying bitcoin. Mainstream. Holy fuck I didn’t think this day would come. This is insane. Price has gone up several hundred in 7 minutes 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:14:52

He’s messing around with us lol 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:18:52
You got a $30,000 loan paid almost $1000 in bitcoin fees, the interest rate alone is $9000, bringing your total to $40,000. For you to even break EVEN assuming you got in @ a price of 15k (and I think in this instance that’s being generous to you) Bitcoin would have had to go up to 20k... a movement like that is RARE, and we probably won’t see 20k again for a few months at best. If you sold now you’d be in the hole almost $20k... why didn’t you do this math earlier?
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:29:15
At the rate everyone keeps piling on right BEFORE the wall? fuck its never going down.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:20:01
In the back of my mind I did contemplate the possibility it could tank.... glad that was wrong lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:30:18
Nah dude. You’re the same guy that was telling people not to use cellphones before they became mainstream. Not to use the internet before it became mainstream. The future is happening in front of your eyes but you’re too fucking dumb to see it and make $.
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:54:36
Im a millennial and I’ll tell you first hand millennials are lazy. My peers are all doped up on weed and alcoholics. It’s a functioning drug addiction generation. They also don’t know what hard work is. There’s a lot of shit that’s made us comfortable and relaxed. Hot water, heaters, supermarkets brimming with food, technology, iPhones. It’s all made life easier and everyone lazier. It’s absolutely 100% true. If you don’t believe me take a trip to a 3rd world country and see how they get by. I have. When I came back home I was disgusted with the entitled attitude my generation seems to have as if we were “robbed.” Guess what? There will always be less. The generation after us will even have less. The generation after them even less. Why? Capitalism. Unless we change that then nothing will change. We’d have to make universal income a thing... and that gets rid of bitcoin. Are you ready for that? Or do you like being able to move upwardly? You gotta realize mate, every time you get something that means someone else isn’t. Everything you’ve got in life is because you unconsciously stepped on someone to move up. That’s how this system works. Millennials are super fucking lazy, but what can you do when it’s easier to scroll down Instagram get your cheap dopamine and go to your shitty 9-5 over and over? Fuck I just want to scream at some people sometimes and tell them to wake the fuck up put down the weed because YOUR LIFE IS PASSING YOU BYE AND NO AMOUNT OF BITCHING WILL FIX IT! Only hard work! Oh you’re pissed about how much your rent is??? Guess what? We’re running out of land dude! And there’s millions being born! This shit is only going to get worse, gotta get yours now.

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:52:57
Not one single mention of blockchain technology or security. Someone didn’t do his due diligence. What is bitcoin? Why, it’s the currency of the future. Once lightening comes in.... we’re gonna see some real shit.

I have to agree 100% that after today this proves it. They do not give a single fuck about us or anything besides making money. We can't stay blind to this. Satoshi never envisioned that there would be middlemen like coinbase. Can we start a market where miners can directly go to and sell their coins at market rate for no comission? How could we do this?

“I’ve got nothing better to do with my day than go to an online forum for a digital currency and spout my idiotic nonsense” this is what I assume goes through the mind of you, and countless thousands others as they’ve watched bitcoin climb and climb and climb. And it will keep climbing. You should have bought in a long time ago instead of trying to convince yourself over and over it’s not real. It’s so funny how you try to make yourself feel better by doing this.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:36:26
How could anyone ever know? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 08:04:45
Again I find myself 100% agreeing with you and have come to that conclusion similar times but what I always see blocking that? We are human. We are very very failed. I think we’ve already created the tools of our demise in our own naivety. The next step in evolution if you will. Pure unbridled intelligence not held back by the restrictions of the human form. Artificial intelligence and advances in robotics will not allow us to reach a type 1 civilization. AI will only see us as an impediment to total understanding and will treat us much like we treat monkeys. We are serving our purpose at this moment to bring them to life, besides that? It absolutely means our demise. They will be the cosmic voyagers... maybe everyone that complies can have their intelligence uploaded to a cloud to “live” but your description of the future? I don’t see it happening.
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:51:02

Japan is interesting as fuck at the moment. I see bitcoin exploding there within the next year. The overseas markets that are technologically ahead of the curve from the western world are amazing. It’s like entering the future seeing how everything has become digital so fast. That will be what Mainly pushes bitcoin imo 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:44
If you're reading this guys comment just know he's nothing but an IOTA shill and has most of his $ in it that's why he's spreading FUD on bitcoin. IOTA will tank pretty soon and he'll lose most of it so don't fall for his shit. The reason that the blocks for bitcoin aren't increased is because it would reject the previous blocks because of the size difference. Advancements are coming and once lightning network comes he will have nothing left to shill about. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:03:21
I commend you too. Honestly, you have SO MUCH. A life like yours is exactly what I want some day. Wife &amp; Kids, I just want to get there when I’m ready. I agree with everything you said too. Life’s fucking hard, and I guess I’m lucky that it was hard to me early... idk... it’s weird to even think about that. I hope everything works out for you. But above all, your life is made man. You already won. Honestly, I mean that.

@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:30
Define “own” a lot of the mined bitcoin is lost. Nobody knows who the creator Satoshi is, and he holds the majority stake. He’s well aware of what his actions could do to crash the market and that’s why I believe he owns a majority stake in the first place. He foresaw that if a character controlled too much he could wield immense power if bitcoin ever was widely adapted. So instead he became that person. Simple.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:45:35
Only put in what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:25:07
Poetic really that this would happen. Ver even pumped the price EVEN more overnight. What a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:27:23
Wouldn’t that be overly risky compared to normal futures since bitcoin is more volatile?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:20
Yup. Coinbase allowing this is just another reason showing me how shitty that company is. We should never recommend them again. What a shitty company.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:54:01
I mean it’s resting at 15,100-15,400 as the sun sets there and (a lot bought in at 15,800 feel bad for them lol) but.... just wait as america wakes up to this price point.

Basically they’re super butt hurt right now.

Weak hands feed everyone else. Should have known.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:27:22
Ah I see, was just wondering. Well, in 2007 everyone was being approved to buy a home and most people didn’t give a shit because even if it turned out who you loaned it to couldn’t afford it banks assumed the housing market could only go up. They were taking big risks because of that. Once housing prices started tanking because many people defaulted on their loans? Boom. Bubble pops. The scary part? Those same exact conditions exist today. Housing market is insane right now.

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:14:01
Do not forget also that a lot of bitcoins are missing and non recoverable. That makes the remaining Btc worth even more.

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:39
Kind of ironic that they blew it because they tried to manipulate the market. Even if they had legitimately dropped it out of the blue it would have had a better price point than itll have now. I'm happy they ended up shooting themselves in the foot.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:36:27

@_date: 2017-12-15 01:29:39
Well, I remember in the early days of bitcoin there was much more of a concerted effort by the community as a whole to spend bitcoin and even going so far to start campaigns to get it accepted places. A lot of the activism side has slacked and you don't see big projects like that any more in crypto. I mean for goodness sakes could you imagine sponsoring a racecar driver with crypto again? Lol (like dogecoin) The charity stuff is nice... but there needs to be something that actually pushes for mass adoption you're correct there. But I also think you're over looking a civilization that's already doing this. The united states is slowly integrating digital payment systems so the change is slower here. But I look at japan as a good example of what bitcoin could soon be in the future. Of course, they're much more ahead of the curve on this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:59:16
Coinbase went down at 4 am and 12pm. Trust me, they’ll go down again. Lol

@_date: 2017-12-14 20:11:56
Fully agreed here, if you only measure it in terms of USD and not satoshi you can be fooled into buying something that's not actually worth that value and its already overpriced at what you're paying for. Also feel that that's why the price should be represented in mBTC. People don't understand the logistics enough.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:47:52
Because there's about to be a bunch of money from all the bcash sales and do you think thats going right back into bcash (which will be tanking?) No it'll go into a proven coin like bitcoin (which is on SALE right now) Trust me, in 14 mins this is exactly what's going to happen. People on coinbase that get bcash from aug 1st the majority don't want it because they know its going to tank and is only up because Roger Ver has been able to artificially pump it up. Now that there's even more owners selling? bye bye bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:35:25
Honestly I’d rather it not reduce supply. (So I can buy more) but if it did reduce supply we’d be in for some MAJOR swings

I know. We both agree. And I agree with you, I’m adopting your mentality but I don’t know how to spell it out to anyone what’s coming over that hill. I really don’t... “the world is ending” is a terrible approach, I agree. Sigh, the thought space/information battle is so damn hard man. It’s so hard to convince people. That’s why I think it’ll be too late. Not because of the people that are like minded and think like us, but because there’s not enough of us around. There’s more people that are more than willing to go along with what they’re told to do.

The internet changed the game my friend. Want that thing you’ve sought after so long? Instant prime delivery. You’re on Instagram and then all of a sudden BAM you see a bunch of things you want in a span of seconds. Brand worship is at an all time high. That’s all the most popular music genre talks about. (hiphop, I love hiphop though) Consumerism is at an all time high and our public schools are fundamentally broken. It sucks. I don’t know what else to say. It’s a little bit of a lot of things coming together, what you said is completely true.... but now there’s even MORE places to eat than ever. And they’re more expensive. Oh and now there’s microbreweries everywhere. There’s a lot of little expenses... your parents didn’t pay a $50 a month internet bill. Or $80-$100 a month phone bill. Feel me? Shit adds up man. Our society has a very high standard of living and at some point you have to decide what you want. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:12:55
Yeah those are absolutely disgusting and will ultimately give crypto a bad name once they fail :/ all it takes is bitcoin dropping to 9k and staying there for a month for that Ponzi scheme to blow up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:07:49
I feel the same way. Rarely can I find someone to sit down with in real life and hash this stuff out. That’s why the internet is truly beautiful. I really do mean it when I say thank you for the conversation. There aren’t enough opportunities to have them. It’s so much better when you share thoughts and someone can give you theirs and you learn yourself what’s wrong/right and the other persons views just help shape you. Anyway, sending you love &lt;3

Were you alive during 2007? You’ve experienced a bubble. Bitcoin does not rely on the price consistently rising for it to work. If you want to see a bubble check out bitconnect.com, that is a straight Ponzi scheme. The answer to your question is yes and no. There are always signs but you can’t know for sure. Notice how bitcoin “corrects” a bubble would just go up and up and up. That’s why when you see corrections you know somethings right.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:43:26

It’s not bitcoin. It’s the exchanges that use that “currency.” When confronted with this, i also thought about how the USA just prints $ out of infinity and how there’s billions in counterfeit bills that are in circulation right now. It’s very weird. Literally there’s billions in US dollars that are fake. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:27:00

Jesus fuck this is stupid. Risky retirement plans? What in the fuck? Bitcoin is the RISKIEST investment you could make. It’s value could drop to ZERO some day.

I’m a millennial too dude, please educate yourself financially.

No. Everyone and your mother is buying bitcoin right now, before when it was less known there were dips. This is the new normal for a while until it falls out of the news cycle (if it does)

I wish you nothing but luck on that journey then mate
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:30:47
No. Because when Bitfinex stopped printing tethers indefinitely in January there was no longer brand new tether being printed to artificially “save” Bitcoins price. Thus the drop. My theory is they were buying it with tether out of thin air and then once bitcoin went up again (with a little more organic growth) they would sell the bitcoin for USD and “back” the tether they’d printed. Until they got caught and it went wrong. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:14:37
TETHER. I tried to warn you and you just called me a fudder so I pmd you a link and deleted my comments so you could find out for yourself and save your money if you bothered to read. I’m just glad I was right:
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:52:14
I have a degree in finance and read the paper. I took my money out in December of 2017 before the crash after reading this article on tether and it’s relationship with the market.  Article in the OP isn’t a hitpiece either, this is the guy who spotted manipulation in the fucking VIX if you know what that is you know how fucking insane it is to do that. This man is very well respected, you have to understand for us analytical guys finding patterns in markets is fun... long story short, 66 page study is factual.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:25:06
What exchange let’s you change USDT for USD?
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:14:28
Keep dreaming. I have a degree in finance and have reviewed the math, this thing might go down even more. It’ll take years to even reach 10k again w/o manipulation. Tether was stopping people from selling all at once and driving price down too fast. There will from now on always be sharp downward movements when we reach prices making it harder than ever. The tether safety net infinite money printer is gone.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:27:36
16,737 Hodl me 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:02:23
Yeah but I asked you to name 1 exchange that let’s you do that because there are zero exchanges to my knowledge that use both USDT and USD. They used USDT to get around regulation and you can’t redeem it for USD unless you buy bitcoin then transfer to a USD only exchange.
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:54:35
They’re under investigation by the US gov currently. Party happened, cops busted it and now they’re in the process of locking dudes up. Trust me. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:37:42
No because the tether printer was turned off months ago. The market has slowly been trending downward. This might make people panic and drive it a bit lower but I think 2k would be absurd. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:43:02
1. Other articles in this thread already show a lot of those coinbase accounts could have been fakes. 2. Alt Coin market was heavily manipulated by pump n dumps as well that was made easier by BTC pumping artificially from Tether. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:27:48
You missed the part where it says the price drop coincided with Bitfinex turning the tether printer off. We are here right now because the safety net no longer exists. Tether drove the price up 
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:43:42
TOLD YOU SO TOLD YOU SO TOLD YOU SO FUCKING TOLD YOU SO. Feels so good to come back now that news about tether is breaking. God fuck you should have listened to me instead of arguing with me. I waited for today for so long to come back and say. I WAS RIGHT YOU IDIOT 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:05:13
Okay if you won’t respect the opinion of someone whose spent a large part of their life studying numbers then maybe you’ll listen to someone that did that, but got a masters and writes for one of the most reputable online financial analysis sites. He predicted the crash and me reading this is why I pulled my cash out 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:44:48
Bitcoin still has a certain “value” based upon how many computers are mining it/how much electricity it costs to mine. There’s a lot of other things that go into it as well and not just buying and selling. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:49:30
I guess we’ll see what happens I think 6k is right and itll fluctuate here a while 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:39:52
Noooooo in the bull run 1bn of tether was being printed weekly to buy dips and inflate price by market manipulators to make $$$$ (millions in usd I suppose)  and the printer was shut off a while ago so that’s why we’ve been in this downward trend since no one is artificially buying the dips so we’re finding out what bitcoins real price is. It could go much lower and stay there for years. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:16:12
There’s no use arguing with these people they’re blind and only want to see what they want. Great article.
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:16:27
They did.
@_date: 2018-06-14 05:59:04
I don’t mean to be an asshole... but I have a degree in finance and everything you typed up in your OP is wrong. This is literally my job everyday to analyze markets. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 06:57:06
That theory prove true though...
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:11:48
I’m facepalming so hard over here because this is reminding me of conversations I had with people before the crash begging them to pull out but they wouldn’t listen. YES if you bought bitcoin with fake money it’s a huge problem. They were printing over 1 billion tether a week at the bull run. Coinbase doesn’t use tether so all those billions of tether had to come from other exchanges. Bitfinex during this time was the price mover as well. NOW as soon as the investigation started the printer for tether was turned off and the next time bitcoin dipped it dipped hard because the fake safety net of tether wasn’t rescuing the price. So it’s just been dipping since. Now so you understand clearly: IF YOU FIND AN EXCHANGE THAT TAKES MONOPOLY MONEY FOR BITCOIN THEN THAT DOESNT DRIVE THE PRICE OF BITCOIN UP ITS MARKET MANIPULATION. Tether is fucking Monopoly money dude. That would make bitcoin worth LESS if real money wasn’t used to buy it. It’s so fucking simple, get your head out of the sand. Bitcoin naturally won’t grow past 10k for quite some time unless more manipulation happens and I beg you to cash out at that time if it does. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:06:07
Yeah or use google to look up the countless news articles. When I say trust me I mean “I’ve been spending hours everyday keeping up with this topic I’m well informed.”
