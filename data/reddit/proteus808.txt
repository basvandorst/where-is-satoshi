when was the last time someone bought coffee with gold and why would you want to? At the rate btc has been going just wait long enough and you can buy your own coffee shop

well that’s the side effect of mass adoption which a lot of old schoolers were trying to make happen. and yes i do agree we need another crypto that needs to be mass adopted like bitcoin is which can scale better, ltc would be a good option.

yes i’ve noticed that, a lot of them just seem bitter. prolly traded they’re btc posistions for bch then got fucked and then when they see btc rising and realize all the money they could’ve made they’re only response is well well i can still buy a cup of coffee so you suck dragonslayer beeotch. literally that’s what they say word for word on all of they’re posts hahaha

let’s be honest here, people who own bitcoin do not want to spend it i mean it would be stupid to do that. btc is definitely moving away from that model, it would be easier to just exchange it to an alt coin or fiat for everyday transactions. like i said when was the last time you saw someone go to a coffee shop and try to buy coffee with a bar of gold? yet gold is still the standard of value that we all live by.

i’m gonna regret asking this but please explain yourself. wouldn’t owning enough of any currency be enough to buy a top end sports car even bcash or even fiat currency apply to your logic.

let’s be real here if you had 1 btc would you rather be able to buy a cup of coffee and it be just enough to cover your one cup of coffee or not be able to buy a cup of coffee due to insane fees but be holding 16k?

umm you trade it in an exchange for fiat then buy a  coffee or if you hold btc long enough buy the coffee house or fuck hold it longer buy columbia make your own fuckin coffee

guess those were different days now everyone in here is using it more as an investment or get rich quick scheme. just is a bit funny when bitcoin cash users make such a big deal on btc not really being able to buy a cup of coffee when the fact is no one holding btc really ever wants to well maybe except you :)

but the housing market was doomed to fail due to subprime loans, how can you compare that to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:52:39
look at exchange percentage for btc then look at bch and you tell me who’s getting pumped from asian markets. 40% with bch while btc is nowhere near that and more evenly spread. even if bitfinex were to drop out that wouldn’t account for more than 15% of btc volume. 
in the end it’s a fear tactic to get people to sell their posistion in btc to bch, which in turn would create herd mentality dropping btc price which allows for some big whales to get in on some discounted btc prices. 
last thing is who the hell reveals they’re evil plans haha, in short just hodl or alleviate your posistion in btc to some alt coins to minimize risk.
