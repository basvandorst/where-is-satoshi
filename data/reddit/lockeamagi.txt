This is why I will never keep funds in an exchange or with any third party service, only in my personal wallet.

Do your trade, immediately withdraw funds upon completion.

Sure, but I think a lot of people were/are using exchange accounts as their primary wallet. The exposes them to unnecessary additional risk.

I move my BTC off of Coinbase as soon as the buy goes through. It's trivial to move them-you just enter the wallet address, like you're sending BTC to a third party. Storing BTC in your own wallet gives you more control-you are not beholden to Coinbase and any stupid policy they might choose to implement in the future.

Awesome, just signed up. Looking forward to instant BTC buys (at least up to $500)!

Buy on Circle, send to your own wallet.

Why is there a 2-5 business day waiting period when you don't have to wait for an ACH to clear or anything like that?
Also, consider putting your current exchange rate on the front page.

Hell, eBay won't even yank the listing if it's blatantly obvious something is stolen-search for "bad ESN" on eBay; I got upwards of 3000 listings, and pretty much the only way a cell phone would have a bad ESN if it was reported as lost or stolen.

Hopefully this means they're going to open to the general public and not require invites soon.

What's wrong with gambling, if you don't gamble more than you can afford to lose, and do not keep your coins in the casino or sportsbook after you are finished gambling?

The subreddit does have a duplicate post filter. This did not set it off.

Circle itself doesn't charge a fee, but some banks charge cash advance fees for credit/debit cards.

Couldn't you just buy start with (eg) BTC, send to an exchange, buy Doge, send to another exchange, buy BTC, and send to another wallet? Why pay a mixer fee in addition to the exchange fee and the spread?

I'm shocked and appalled to see a country with a credit rating barely above junk trying to prevent capital from fleeing.

I wonder if it will ever get through to the people who favor this sort of thing that they are just one election away from being in the crosshairs themselves.

Use Coinbase/Circle/whatever to buy--&gt;send BTC from there to an offsite wallet---&gt;send from offsite wallet to Backpage. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 19:11:36
They did fix the problem.
@_date: 2015-07-04 16:05:23
Hope this catches on in other cities.

Probably all of the US based exchanges are going to end up doing this.

I don't think signing up for Coinbase with you escorting name would be a good idea-I don't think you should give them any opening to find out what you're doing.
Any funds bought through Coinbase should be sent to a personal wallet before being sent to Backpage.
Clients should be told to send funds to your personal wallet, NOT to your Coinbase wallet. Funds from your personal wallet should be tumbled before being sent to Coinbase to be converted to USD.
The above goes for any USD-BTC gateway (except something like Localbitcoins).
