Sure would be nice for Mr Trump to stop this non-sense trade war; otherwise US miners will continue suffer an immediate 25% penalty vs China.
@_date: 2018-10-14 15:17:21
If the miner it self does not come from China then you’re fine.  If it ships from China then it will have a 25% import tax

I don’t understand why,7nm already coming???
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:27:42
How?  If it’s current sitting in 1 wallet, and then moves to another wallet in exchange for $$$ off the market, how does this affect the exchange?
@_date: 2019-08-29 18:50:31
That’s just it.  We don’t know yet.

At minimum Kleinman would need to, in order to pay for the Estate tax on the money.

I guess I don’t understand why he claimed to be Satoshi knowing this would happen.
@_date: 2019-08-27 11:15:32
I don’t quite understand this story.   The money he has (mainly all in Bitcoin SV I assume) now has a substantial portion owed to an estate.  Has he already sold vastly more of his holding than he owes?
@_date: 2019-08-29 15:29:05
Precisely what I was thinking as well

Those pools do BCH and BTC, so the real question is, what percentage of BTC are they currently even mining?
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:34:10
Nope, it’s fishing out hobbyists.  Large players seek out insanely cheap power and move their gear there and just watch small players and hobbyists go under and scoop up their gear used
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:49:24
Not really, there’s plenty to be mined and more efficient miners are coming out of other vendors.
Bitmain will likely be dead, not mining.
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:02:26
I am assuming they will find a way to survive and run those miners but depends on their electricity prices I guess.
If they truly go belly up then for sure having them gone is nice but how much of their hash power was really on BTC anyways?
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:36:28
I personally think they will love through this.  They will kill off a ton of staff and divisions and will move miners to somewhere profitable and try to restart - just my personal opinion
@_date: 2019-01-01 19:15:13
Main reason are still that bots and speculators do not confidently believe it’s long term trend has shifted yet.  Traders and bots control a lot of price movement currently; much like wall street and while we have a huge quantity of retail traders in this space they still like to make money and trading current trend is how they play it and make money and a lot of it.  They make money when it’s moving, they don’t care if that’s up or down.  Traders don’t HODL. :)

Bingo.  Worthless company with poor management trying to find a last ditch effort to raise capital and prolong their death
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:27:18
Good for network security as hashrate shifts but crap for miners would will see yet another large increase in difficulty with a depressed BTC price
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:20:53
I only required 51%
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:49:06
Still trying to understand how? Lol
@_date: 2019-01-22 08:29:34
Seems a bit far reaching 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:12:18
That’s a great question.  I am not curious as well.  
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:25:28
Yes and no.
1) BCash holders likely know its dead now and will be looking to convert to BTC or dump to Fiat.  
2) BTC hashrate will increase with miners giving up on bcash and try to squeeze anything they can out of their miners and it will push out more hobbyist miners
3) The new might really spook trading speculation as it could be seen as simply bad for crypto in general and we could see the entire market drop.  I sort of thing that was the cause for the 5% drop today
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:59:27
Item  could be positive for BTC as many who do not want to incur huge taxes moving to fiat would move to stablecoins or BTC.  So we could see increased demand for BTC.  Other two items are bearish for BTC
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:21:43
It’s not good.

S17s hitting the market and watch out, the WhatsMiner M20s hitting market in weeks.  Very soon here S9s will be dead and you better own something 50TH or higher.

What are they doing with this money?  They’re not just handing it out, they’re buying something (bonds for instance)... Is there literally no transparency as to where that money goes?

It ain’t over, no signs yet of it turning around.  Couple massive limit orders getting hit ain’t going to do it.  Whales have drained they’re wallets and until their orders kick in, volume won’t be enough to drive up
@_date: 2018-07-13 06:50:29
Here's the thing... Big money keeps talking about how the bitcoin fad is over; but behind the scenes, or at least as quiet as they can. They're slowly pumping money into the market because they will at some point come out incredible bullish when it makes sense to do a turn-about.  
@_date: 2019-09-25 10:54:24
Everything you just said seems bad lol...
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:40:36
Because BTC price is not primarily controlled by whale miner speculation - we not have wall street, and other large monies.  The premise behind halving increasing BTC price all centers around the presumption that demand is enough to create a scarcity - but it’s not
@_date: 2019-09-29 12:52:17
Agreed.  There’s a lot that will transpire in 10 years.
@_date: 2019-09-02 01:46:21
Yet is a long time away
@_date: 2019-09-01 23:22:58
Halving isn’t going to rocket BTC like it did in 2017
