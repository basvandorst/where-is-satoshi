So the solution is what? Limited supply and then skyrocketing deflation?
@_date: 2014-02-14 09:12:39


But a huge amount of irrational humans invested into Bitcoin is better? This "opinion" so far seems to be to keep a low amount of inflation and to prevent an economic collapse when something like a financial crisis happens. I take that over thousands of people selling because of some fear/event/... every day. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:38:38
The argument I hear all the time is that BC is so great because it has no fee. Well, turns out it isn't the only payment that doesn't have one.

I don't think miners care about that. They want short term profits to pay for their equipment.

On the other hand that also make individuals more accountable. You can't just fuck up, because hey you are in a conservative/democrat district and will be reelected. It actually refelcts bad on the party.
Overall it means that people will have to stick to party lines and I think for me as a voter that is not bad, because if I don't like that party line I vote for a different party. For me that is much easier to keep track of than different invididuals.

I'm fine with that. I don't think inflation is evil and a deflationary currency is the solution. What would be nice is a simple online payment system.
@_date: 2014-05-02 18:32:14
There are still going to be errors like selecting the wrong address from that contacts or whatever other database. And when it comes to Bitcoin that payment isn't checked against a name or something similar.

Sorry but this is a typical libertarian view. It's either black or while. I think just because the government fucks up abc doesn't mean they can't make a right decision about xyz.
And why are we even talking about the government here? If I had the choice between betting on Bitcoin in a deflationary and in a inflationary system I would go for the inflationary system (if someone would actually come up with a good one which would be the real challenge). 


I just showed you one personal example about the camera that just because you have the money doesn't mean you buy it. It's often a decision about what I have now and if investing in a newer better product is really worth it. Same for many people who buy a new car out of the factory. They still often have a car that works and which they will sell. If you have your money in Bitcoin which gain 2,3 or 5% in value every year then you are talking about savings around $1000 or more every year you keep you old car.

Governed by nobody obviously makes it much better


Apart from the little problem that it's actually deflationary in the end...


And if that fails your money is gone


I don't see why that would not be possible with common currencies if someone would build the right service
@_date: 2014-06-11 18:59:00
Well, not in Germany.
@_date: 2014-01-27 15:33:09


No. The main reason it happed is because some Russian Oligarchs put billions into some small bank of a small island, because it got great interest rates. The banks in cyprus might just as well have invested in some other bad stocks and not government bonds and we would be in the same situation.
@_date: 2014-04-19 01:54:09


BULLSHIT. If this was a Bitcoin "bank" they would have gotten **NOTHING**. They put the money into a bank, the bank got bankrupt and they were only inured for 100k. Sorry, but if I had more than that kind of money then I would sure to put it somewhere, where it is safe.
@_date: 2014-02-09 05:33:54
No it isn't. A constant inflation around 2% is much better than some random 10%, 100% or whatever gains.
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:42:21


Assuming people would suddenly all pay in BC...
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:47:45
And my *real* wallet is easy to protect or at least i know how to  (obviously it isn't 100% safe). I have it in my pocket all the time.
With just having my PC save in my home and my phone in my pocket is not enough. I have to make sure both are secure against a virus or someone hacking it. I have to be careful every time I download and use apps etc.

It's nice, but limited to their service.
@_date: 2014-04-06 15:18:11
So that's not really a benefit of bitcoin. And that's where all the fees come in which "Bitcoin doesn't have". Because if I just trade with a merchant than I don't have the protection so why chose BC?

You can divide every currency as much as you want and Banks, Wall Street etc. do it all the time. No problem to have something like $0.0005 Dollar. It's just so worth so little that it makes no sense to print Millicent or Microcent and is not important for the average persin.
@_date: 2014-01-27 01:25:48
You realize the alternative would have been the bank goes bankrupt and you get even less? Also the only reason those deposits are protected to a certain amount at all is because of the government. Maybe you should read the terms and conditions before you put more than 100k into one account.
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:33:03

Well, maybe you just have to face the reality that it isn't about what you wanted it to be anymore. Maybe you shouldn't have made a deflationary currency, because of the evil FED, if you didn't want people to see it as in investment. Maybe you shouldn't have plastered the frontpage and comments with stories about people making a lot of money.

But you could make "Dollarcoin" public. You could have a Dollarchain. Of course the main difference would be how you create those Dollarcoins and get them into the system, which would have to be done by the government, which is why a realize this clone won't like it, but that's a system I would prefer.

Yes. Most of the older generation aren't on it. A lot of my friends at university just make a fake accounts, simply because so much was done on facebook groups. If you look at interactions for example in the US compared to Germany it's a pretty big joke. The only sites that have more than a million users are international brands and some sports stars and musicians, meanwhile Walmart has like 34million fans. Or compare Obama to Merkel. There isn't even a party that has more than 100k likes. Also very few people actually post or like things, I think most just use is as chat progam these days. My news feed these days are pretty much only pages.

Bitcoin is never going to be as secure as a bank account when it comes to losing money. Just the fact that it is at a bank that manages it and I can contact makes it more than some Bitcoin Wallet which nobody has the ultimate controll over in the end. In addition banks just as much traces transaction is there is a much higher chance you will know who is the owner of the other account than with wallets everybody can set up. Bitcoin is never going to win over a bank account when it comes to the risk of loosing money (maybe if you use it for cold storage, but then you also shouln't keep it in a regular bank account)
@_date: 2014-01-11 11:56:42
No, but not everybody is living paycheck to paycheck. If I'm saving up for a new car I might decide to drive my old one is good for another year. That big holiday trip to Europe we wanted to do? Let's do it next year. I've been looking to buy a new camera for some time and still haven't done it because mine still does the job. Getting a much better interest than I do now on that money would certainly not make me buy it any faster. 
And the problem is not having 2-3% deflation, the problem is that if those 2-3% slow it down too much it can become 5 or 10% and then you are in trouble.

The financial crisis was a very special situation. No matter where you were invested if the government wouldn't have saved the banks you would probably have lost you money, just because the economic crisis would then have fucked the guy you have the money to.
But usually if you don't make a high risk investment then you will get you money bank from banks, because they simply have so many loans that overall the risk evens out. They calculate than a certain % of loans will fail.
@_date: 2014-01-08 12:23:26

You are ignoring that the frontpage is limited. You don't have to moderate /new for duplicate stories you just have to look at the hot 20 and remove post that makes it that far. If a story gets submitted 30 times then most of them will never make it that far.

Mapstyles on OSM simply have to be limited. Yes, they are lacking some stuff, but on the other hand nobody would want to see 100 hydrants that are in the database at some places.
I guess search is simply due to server and maybe even PC load. Might cause to much trouble if people jump around in the edit modus and have to load new data all the time.


Well, there is no reall satelite view. What happened is that you left the edit modus.


Well, the thing is that some mappers make a lot more changes and for them seeing all the 30 nodes of the wood area they just changed would be just as useless. But I agree the interface could be made so it gives you both options. Unfortunally OSM kinda lacks programers on the main page so a lot of requested featues are still on the waiting list.


I think you have to see OSM more like a Wikipedia page. If you add a small paragraph then you also won't have some special edit options just because you added it. 
Overall I agree OSM needs help tools on the main page, but as I said it's really lacking people who have the time to do it. It will probably get better and at some point allow you to just edit on POI.  would kinda allow you to do that, but it's obviously still no that easy to get the right ID.
@_date: 2014-08-15 21:56:49


But a account is never going to be owned by anybody. It's all in the blockchain. If you lose access to your wallet then you can't go into the blockchain office or call and say "Hey guy I think something is wrong here".


You know 100% that there is no virus on your computer? On Your phone? No attack between you and the person on the other end.


And normal account in many countries are protectet for something like $100000. So unless you keep more your government has to fail until that becomes an issue. If my government fails well then things are so fucked up anyway.

If you want to see this more often you should contribute to [OpenStreetMap]( so it becomes a viable alternative to google.

@_date: 2014-01-16 00:06:45
You mean like the banks created all this new wealth with mortages?
@_date: 2014-04-10 01:33:17
If people really cared about Credit Card fees they could use cash.
Or stores could simply not accept credit cards.
@_date: 2014-02-25 10:34:22
But it should not be the case with a currency.
@_date: 2014-08-16 00:42:36


The government bailed them out for what they were told they would be bailed out. Sorry, but Bitcoin and libertarian are the only fucking sub who don't seem to get that. Those rich Russians only have themselves to blame for keeping 1million in accouns insured for 1/10 of that.


Yes, but there is at least a chance to figure out who it was, reverse the transaction or maybe be insured against it. Obviously you might be fucked, but if someone gets his hand on your bitcoins with a keylogger there is pretty much zero chance you will get it back once it left your wallet. 


Nothing stopps you from doing something similar with a bank account. The problem is that for everyday business it's not that feasible or where do you plan to get your 2nd signature when paying with your phone in a store?


If that's what bitcoin really is than have fun going mainstream with your buzzwords.

Pretty impossible to get an A in art here in Germany in secondary school if you don't have some talent.
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:31:11
If Austria is anything like Germany then the reason they don't have such a system is probably because almost nobody uses checks anymore.
@_date: 2014-01-11 10:37:41


Does not make any sense to me. If the value is increasing then even if I have more money I would keep it to get even more.
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:54:57
SR2 was probably one of the few places where people where actually using BC as a currency. Look at all the business adopting it, all just using payment processors.
@_date: 2014-01-28 05:35:05
Right... it hasn't anything to do with Bitcoin being volatile or stuff like that..
@_date: 2014-03-13 18:41:30
They point is you obviously have been into Bitcoin for some time and this sub posts about how bad PayPal and CreditCard companies are all the time. Meanwhile your title sounds like you just heard about Bitcoin a bit on the side and then when making a PayPal transaction today you finally understood why all those people support Bittcoin,
@_date: 2014-06-18 15:22:41
But that's not how flattr works.
@_date: 2014-06-17 14:22:22
Well, the have to find a new solution for that in Germany. (If they will even be able to operate any longer)
@_date: 2014-03-17 04:08:32
So what you are saying is that long term the price is going to drop as Bitcoin become cheaper and more affordable?
@_date: 2014-01-08 17:10:42
It's more about being confronted with a different view. She should still always check that stuff for more sources and read up on it.

It still just. Just a ticking bomb waiting to go off.
@_date: 2014-01-27 14:10:27


No it did not. There was never a guarantee for savings over a certain amount. And they didn't just take money because they are some evil government, the bank cut a deal with the government so it would not go bankrupt. If it wasn't for the evil government taking that money probably even more would have been lost.


Oh right, because trading with Bitcoin can never go wrong, right? 
@_date: 2014-02-09 13:17:05
Well, with low fees.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:19:45
My point is that if getting into you great Bitcoin currency is seen as investing then nobody is going to do it. The benefits you come up with like 2% less fees than credit cards are a joke compared to the risk-
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:53:34
Try to explain that to people who complain about Amazon not just adding a BitPay Button.
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:42:51
Which is why the "currency" is going to fail in the end. People don't use it and just see it as an investment.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:49:16
That's seems pretty pointless. OSM is always going to be more up to date than his owm database that just works with one app-

The limited supply of Bitcoin is the main reason a lot of people don't support it.

Which is why they finally did it. One of the main reasons for them was always "we don not want to endorse bitcoin". Now that companies like Dell are accepting it, Wikimeda doing so isn't as significant.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:54:30
Nope. Sorry. I understand it and that's exactly why I don't like it.
* Deflationary
* No central mechanism to control it when a bubble bursts (not an issue as long as people see it as an investment, but if I want a to hold some money in a currency?)
* No protection: Against any kind of vulnerabilities or e.g. online merchants as there is no way to get my Bitcoin back (yes, 3rd parties can do that but then I get all the fees just like with CC)
@_date: 2014-01-08 13:25:09


Just that unless you keep it in Bitcoin your bank or government might at one point ask you where all the money in your account came from.

One whole computer mouse? Damn adoption is really taking off.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:55:55
Why would customers then use Bitcoin if only amazon saves money?
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:20:56
The idea of OpenStreetMap is mostly that local mappers get it done or people that are interested in certain local information. So people interested in Bitcoin will monitor and fix payment listing, while maybe your local fire department updates the hydrants in the area.
@_date: 2014-07-18 19:52:21


Not every country works like the US. In Germany direct debit is very common and offered by pretty much every larger online store or available with a 3rd party. And all you need is a bank account and a debit card which kids can get, too.
@_date: 2014-06-30 18:07:54
The problem is nobody in the Bticoin community is willing to contribute to OpenStreetMap and figure out how to tag it.
@_date: 2014-01-08 12:37:40
You can go on an search for Bitcoin and read the comments of the top submissions.
Then you will see why people have a problem with it, like for example that it's deflationary.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:56:10
That's why some subs have a "do not link to us" policy. Sometimes more strict, sometimes more that sub members don't like it.

Thank god the typical use case for the average user works out.

Not an expert, but he might also be in legal trouble if he uses more than maptiles.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:51:52
Both maps are based on OpenStreetMap which google can't buy. And basically EVERYBODY can use that data as long as they agree to the re-share terms. 
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:56:40
Yeah realized that later  when googeling for the openstreetmap nodes of some stores...
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:34:49


If both of these are available to the public (or at least to you), this means you could prove how you voted, right?
@_date: 2014-04-02 04:34:11
You mean without 3rd parties like bitpay and coainbase, eh?
@_date: 2014-04-16 02:28:20
They are still not taking new one or kick inactive ones out. And it the mods that are the problem.
@_date: 2014-01-08 12:41:19
Didn't think about that, but was that really a big reason why a huge amount if people supported it? I mean I can see the demand for it, but I don't see the average Bitcoin supporter as the main peer group of that.
@_date: 2014-01-08 08:51:03
I personally still don't see what I would use it for.
The only thing I would be interested in is a better digital transaction system, like between Bitcoin and PayPal. But I don't see the need for it having its own currency.
@_date: 2014-01-21 17:10:19
Because if you just lend xyz money there is a huge risk you won't get anything back.

Doesn't really help. Merchants could give you Bitcoin discounts, but then they gain nothing. Or they don't then you gain nothing.
The only thing that works is what stores in Germany do and flat out refuse to take Credit Cards.
@_date: 2014-07-24 14:55:19
Accident on my part?
Also unless you had more than 100.000€ in your bank accoun you didn't loose anything. And having more than that in an account for me is really not an accident. If you have that much money you should know more than that is not insured. 
@_date: 2014-12-20 04:12:47
You are ignoring that there are 3rd parties on the road. If a drivers hits me while providing a taxi service and has no commercial insurance I'm fucked.

Why not? Or charge an extra fee on Credit Cards, I think some stores in Germany actually do that. Many simply don't accept them in the first place though.

Paypal or credit cards are establish payment methodes. Bitcoin is not.
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:56:31
But they aren't idiots. Such a big company is going to have people who look at numbers from Overstock. Tiger direct or what else is available and will see that the amount of people using it is very small. Not to mention that they often work together with stores that don't allow for Bitcoin payment. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 11:28:19

Well, that's a main reason Uber is banned in many European countries. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 14:43:42


Right. People investing and then sitting on their coins to make money are really going to help the currency in the long run. 
You still haven't learned from Dogecoin. You don't need people investing in it, you need people using it. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 22:37:38
If I had to guess the main problem maps like these face is that OSM doesn't like sites that do mass imports on one account. So you would need to get people to get a OSM account.
I think  is one of the few exceptions right now.
@_date: 2014-02-09 10:18:05
Good thing nobody owns Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-07-07 22:47:05

@_date: 2014-02-20 21:42:17
And where is the advantage of BT then?
@_date: 2014-01-21 18:44:46

Isn't that what people here always dislike when the government regulates stuff like this?
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:52:51


That's why most people still stick to fiat. Maybe it loses 1-2% of value every year, but at least you don't have to fear your money being worth 10% less over night or more when someone owns you.

Then be happy that that isn't the case with OpenStreetMap. There is close to zero chance you run into trouble for removing a bitcoin tag and writing that you visited the place in the changeset.
@_date: 2015-03-26 21:29:21


That's not even supposed to be on OpenStreetMap so that's easy to remove.

I simply don't see acception Bitpay as the same as accepting Bitcoin. It's no different that accepting Paypal and various other services out there.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:26:05
Just that it isn't great for people. In the US the car industries employs millions of people. What do you think will happen when sales start dropping? And it's not likey that money would be spent somewhere else so it's not really a long term benefit for the environment. Actually people driving they older cars longer is porobably worse.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:40:59

@_date: 2013-12-26 04:53:39
It's basically the same as handing them a $20 note or whatever just a lot more complicated. If the best someone can come up with is giving everybody money then why don't we just stop buying gifts and everybody buys what he wants.

Living in Germany I can tell you that using BitTorrent without proxy  etc. is a pretty bad idea and you will soon find a letter in your mail with a nice fine threatening a even bigger one if you do it again.
Almost everybody I know has stopped torrenting, while 10 years ago it was what everybody did. Now people use streaming sites.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:48:28
But doesn't that somehow destroy a big part of the the purpose of bitcoins if you have to go back to fiat currency every time?
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:42:55
If you order online you will have to give them your address anyway. If you buy in a store you could just use cash (with which you could also buy your gift card). 
@_date: 2013-04-01 23:57:35
You could probably copy and past it and then create such a automation replacement that when you write maybe *bc* it becomes ฿
@_date: 2013-12-03 10:43:59
I mean you first convert dollar into bitcoin, give those to bitpay who convert them back into dollar and then gives those dollars to the company.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:03:31
But then it's not really business using bitcoins. They are still just getting cash. Then bitcoin is essentially the same as when you sell a goldbar and then use the cash to buy something. Of course it's a bit more advanced and a lot easier to do it with bitcoins, but it's not really a currency then.
@_date: 2013-04-13 04:41:59
But the bitcoin value would probaböy still rise over time. All they had to do is way a bit and then later with time transfer it to different accounts etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:27:33
But you take businessinsider.com serious? All they do is linkbait. They have like 20 trackers on that fucking website.  Content of that article = zero
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:04:04


That's a pretty good reason for a currency to have a good value. Oil is limited and demand is not going to go away.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:48:26


No. But compared to the  transaction volume it is. Compare purchases and transaction volume of Bitcoin and PayPal and they will be worlds apart.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:29:27
ALDI is one of the worlds largest retailers and doesn't accept Credit Cards...
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:33:17

That's pretty much how every store in Germany works like.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:20:21
I think the problem for business is the fluctuation. Just look at the last days. How are you as a business supposed to price your stuff?
@_date: 2013-11-29 08:33:37
Comparing Bitcoins with drugs is stupid. Bitcoin has no such addiction effect as drugs. 
Another huge difference is that while drugs are illegal and sold with a huge markup because of the risk, Bitcoins is suppose to be a legal currency and copete against the dollar. That is not going to happen when no business can  accept it. Then it will end up as a payment for drugs and maybe for money transfers out of the country. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:17:09
The don't even have the fucking authority to regulate the Euro...
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:42:03


How do you come up with that number? When is it going to reach it? You offer even less substance than the people who think it's a bubble.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:54:01


And the real problem here is not the currency, but that wages did not keep up with inflation. If you have deflation you are going the same problem the other way round. If an employer can't cut your wage then he is paying you more for the same work.


The problem is that if to many people chose to save the economy can get into trouble when business hasn't enough customers. Of course on a small scale that looks great to you because you can save money, but on a larger scale it might mean you lose your job.

The point is the Euro is the official currency in the Netherlands these days and they Dutch central bank can't even regulate that.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:28:20


Especially as they all seem to ingore that if Bitcoins take off in that process it will end up in a (bitcoin) deflation. Which can be much worse as there isn't anything that could stop it.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:30:06


I doubt it. Most of the stores seem to  accept bitcoin to get some exposure, but don't really care about bitcoin. In the end they will still need cash to pay for supplies and many aren't available in Bitcoin. Also most emploees out there probably won't accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-16 04:19:59
Is this really common in the US? I don't think I know anybody here in Germany who doesn't carry cash.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:11:17


Surprise surprise. That usually never is the case.
But I'm sure know that, that why this is the top comment...
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:01:06
Most people would be pissed off by that too.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:06:23
Until the customer notices he just lost all the benefits from Credit Cards.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:04:42


That sounds really annoying. I mean I usually have Bluetooth turned off because it drains that much battery. So now I would have to take out my phone activate Bluetooth and then also take out the card.

Why would you change these laws? I think it makes perfect sense for the police to go after people who suddently have a huge amount of money in their accound and it's not clear where it comes from.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:21:31
You people don't get it do you? It doesn't matter that as small group of Bitcoin supporters would obviously like that. But the reality is that while millions of people use PayPay for puchases daily that isn't the case with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:34:23


Funny how people upvote this and at the same time a comment further up says:


So please tell me how promoting Bitcoin is remaining neutral...
The reality is the main reason people on want Wikipedia to adopt it is exposure. Hundreds of Millions of people see this $3 message and Wikipedia really doesn't care about 0.05BC from the few people who would donate if they start accepting Bitcoin.

Except that you won't be able to trade with merchants in countries who aren't allowed to take Bitcoin and aren't willing to break the law.

Oh I must be in the wrong sub then. I thought this was about a new currency and not about investment.

Actually 2008 showed us that when something goes wrong politicians can work together to save the financial sector and at the same time the economy and make fast decisions like the bailouts. Same with the FED. It also shows that we learned from the past and insured savings account, so there was no bank run.  
I realize this is a unpopular opinion on and I completely agree that mistakes have been made in the past and too little has been done after 2008, but what 2008 shows is that **if shit hits the fan** then a having a powerful entity behind a currency can actually be important to make such decisions and having the power to execute them fast.

They never accepted them in the first place as far as I know. Which isn't even that uncommon in Germany. They simply try to cut costs everywhere and accepting credit cards with huge fees while selling a lot of items with low margin probably hurts a lot.

Since Bitcoin is not as big as PayPal (yet) then yes, it makes perfect sense **that it hasn't had as much transaction volume flow through it just yet.**
Just that is has.... 
That's my whole point.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:25:24
Because that other payment option is almost used by nobody. Look at all major online stores or services that accept payment and look how many take paypal and how many take bitcoin.

Do you actually understand how flattr works? Because reading the comments here I don't think most people do.
Flattr isn't just a simple donation system, where you donate xyz amount. The idea behind flattr is that **you set yourself a monthly budget and that will be split up among all the flattr buttons you clicked in that month.**
The difference between this and a simply bitcoin donation is that you aren't really spending any money when clicking the button, you are just splitting up your monthly budget, which you already decided to spend. So for example when you read a good blog post you don't have to think is it really worth a donation, how much should I give, how much more can I afford to give away this month etc. you just read it, realize it was a great post and press the flattr button.

Deflation is a problem if Bitcoin is supposed to establish itself as a currency. The widely spread use of Bitpay shows that merchants don't really see it as currency, but more as a high risk investment. 
If Bitcoin actually gets rid of the volatility and people directly use Bitcoin as a payment, then deflation will become an issue.

How the fuck is that remaining neutral? If that's neutral then they would have to support anything that looks somehow ~~neutral~~ promising (Edit)
Waiting until the mainstream adopts something and then follow falls much more into the category of remaining neutral an not embracing something new.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:29:45
What? That's exactly the reason why economists favor a inflationary currency, because they know interest rates and frees will always be higher than inflation making it impossible do to what the top comment says. 
Just look at the practical application reality today.
If you could buy everything on Credit and pay it back later wouldn't you do it? So why aren't you doing it? Exactly, because no bank gives you the rate that would make it work.
@_date: 2013-12-07 19:30:37
Looking at OPs comment's he would probably only consider using it with a service like Bitpay. So would there really be a difference? I mean GYFT is basically BitPay, but instead of a direct money transfer it's via a gift card.

But most people can't afford it to just have huge sums of money lying around for 4-8 years. They have bills to pay.

I think one problem is that you look at this from a perspective as someone who brought them at $20. For you there really isn't much to lose. But imagine someone who brought at $200 and they drop down to $100. For them that's a 50% loss and that's defineatly a bubble.

Because PayPal has been established for years. It's like saying how is accepting VISA/Mastercard neutral. They even have a banking license for Europe. Millions of users, who actually use their service to buy stuff. Why do you think merchants use it even if they don't like their service? Because there is a giant userbase behind PayPal and they want thos as customers.

Of course people will spend their money on everyday things they need. The issue I see is with items that require larger investments and can wait for some time.

We didn't have any banks runs and people didn't lose their money in savings accounts. The situation that resulted out of that is definitely 100000x better than the alternative. But I guess if you aren't from you aren't welcome in this sub.

As far as I know banks also match the name of the account holder. In addition you will always know who got the money. Bitcoin you might never find out who the owner is.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:17:28


I doubt that most people starting to get Bitcoin now see all this regulation as a bad thing. The government did not set this up as joke to anoy you and me, but to fight tax evasion and illegal activities. And the banks themselves probably even have regulations on top of that because they don't want to be involved in this either.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:04:26
At some point people are usually either going to convert it back into Euro/Dollar etc. or use it at a business to buy something. That's where there are options to track it again.

And if they are intelligent the play this in the long run. Slowly cash out first and then drop the price. Then they could even buy in again when the price is low.

But what does bitpay do with the coins? Put them back on the exchange in the very moment they got them? Doesn't sound like that help bitcoins much to establish itself as a currency.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:07:57
Tell that to a car manufaturer who isn't selling any car, because the value of Bitcoin is going up 5% every year and people hold back on purchases.
@_date: 2013-12-02 14:37:34


And what happens with all the value stored in Bitcoins? It's already $14,000,000,000 just imagine how high it becomes as a global currency. 
At some point people will realize everybody is switching to BTC2 and will try to sell their Bitcoins. But buyers will see that too and won't buy them. This would basically wipe out all you wealth stored in Bitcoin.

is pure bullshit. I have some friends who study IT and asked them about 5 months ago and they didn't know about it. Not even sure if they would have known today if I hadn't asked and explained it.
Also all the trouble with bank accounts does not make it easy for people &lt;18 to get into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:12:36
Yes, but that doesn't make it a good currency in general. I mean people on this sub talk about pizza and subway, those are probably the things I would care the least about my anonymity. I don't disagree that there are legitimate reasons, I just think that for the average person that is something they will need very often.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:40:41
Did you actually pay the vendor with Bitcoin or use something like Bitpay?
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:14:08


Because otherwise somebody else is going to do it. GM doesn't want to sell me a car, well Ford will. 
Also a producer has bills to pay... now. Wages, rent, electricity etc. So he needs money.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:51:07
And how do they do that? Adjust their prices in real time?
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:36:03

@_date: 2013-12-16 04:33:20
And then they go trough various tumblers and end up getting cashed out at the other end of the world without you even knowing.
The reality is chances of getting them back is very small, which is why I would not consider  coinbase etc. a secure place for coins.
@_date: 2013-12-03 09:06:12
Do they actually accept Bitcoin or just Bitpay?
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:32:29
But Credit Cards were great for consumers, which is what matters. Every time I read that a advantage for Bitcoins is that there are no chargeback I think people fail to realize that they have convince consumers and not stores to use Bitcoin in the end. If consumers start using it stores will follow anyway.

This isn't just about payment systems. This could be about coding, software, hardware...

And it's not really using Bitcoin as a currency.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:06:59


They are not offering that because it will be worth more. If that was the reason they could just buy them with the Dollars they earn on a exchange. They do it because they are either supporters of Bitcoins or because it gives them free advertisment and new customers, but getting exposure on subs like this. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:42:33
I doubt it. Otherwise those companies would already offer those discounts for chash. And so far most systems I have seen always includet some kind of fees, simply because no companies want to hold a huge amount of bitcoins.
