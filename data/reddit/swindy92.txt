The time is aggressive because you aren't actually addressing points, you're just moving goal posts (taxation is theft, making changes to avoid theft is disqualified) which makes this less a discussion and more like talking to a child that can't grasp concepts.

There are plenty of places that you can live off the grid and just sustain yourself while paying no taxes. Hell, because you'd have no income you can also even get free money!
Or you could stop bitching and understand that you get a lot more benefits by being able to live in society and that part of that is helping pay for that society.

You are welcome to leave, you are welcome to vote for those that are with your thoughts on taxes, you are welcome to run for office if no one agrees. 
But let me stress that the first one is *always* an option if you don't like it

Why would that disqualify them? If your income is low enough that you don't pay taxes, you can't bitch about paying taxes. Or are we just making up rules so you seem less like a whiny idiot?
So lemme get this straight. 
You choose to live in our society where you gain benefit from things taxes pay for like public roads.
You choose to not run for office or try to change laws. 
You choose to not move somewhere that the government doesn't give a fuck about you like most of the middle of Africa, most of india, etc. 
You choose to use the resources taxes pay for such as telecommunication lines.
You choose to not live "off-the-grid" in a sustenance fashion to avoid "being robbed".
You choose a whole lot of things that result in paying taxes. Let me guess, you also believe driving a car is "traveling" and laws shouldn't effect you when you do it.
