Out of curiosity, what makes this situation different than when [Tycho]'s Deepbit pool was the GHash.io a few years back? Did you sell off half your stake then?

but PHP can do ANYTHING!

I got into bitcoins 3 years ago during the 5830 craze. I think I missed something between now and then :p

These graphs please me. If you can do this in Linux, I have a quad socket Barcelona board with 32GB of ram that I would be more than happy to spin up for you tonight.

awwwwww yeah!
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:06:30
I feel sorry that you did all that on a mac air. Barcelona is showing it's age, but boy does it get work done. The offer stands though if you would like to use it. It will be ready :)

With how cpu time works on multicore processors, it has been running for fewer 'real' seconds. I use virtual machines on that array and it was making it unusable. I couldn't imagine running this on something less than my desktop.

Yeah, we should have never let them seal third base.

Welcome shibes!

I understand I/O is. Obviously this had nothing to do network traffic. I've just never seen a program do so much reading!

    Very number. 
                                                                                                   wow.
                        Such leet.

This is what the testnet is for. I would like to see the outcome of this
@_date: 2014-02-15 05:29:14
I hope not. It had to read the entire chain almost 80 times over.

That was using bootstrap.dat file. Bitcoind only had to download 16 weeks of blockchain after that.

A combination of pizza from the box housing the mining equipment and Magic Smoke from the burnt out parts.

moves like Jagger right there.
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:23:11
I see what you didn't do there.
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:15:03
pfft why return it? free money
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:27:55
I'm being facetious
