The blockchain is written by algorithm with zero consideration for anything else. It just becomes a public utility, usable by anyone no matter politics, position or intentions. The humans are still in charge, its just another tool. Bitcoin is the first DAC and it works fine.

An interesting economy could develop where bitcoin prices are always discounted based on a market for bitcoin futures. To me, this would make bitcoin even cooler as people see merchants always posting cheaper prices if the customer pays in bitcoin. The challenge for the merchant is to find a consistent metric to base discounts off of.

That's a legal problem that will likely be worked out over time as their utility finds a niche.

Copycoin? It implements coinjoin within the protocol. Say what you will about pump and dump but it definitely has a fundamental feature difference.
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:05:06
How is that diff from a normal corp though? Assuming this was a real DAC with human shareholders, its decisions would be held accountable.

What's hilarious for a longtime bitcoin holder is how the initial reaction of oblivious techies to Bitcoin is the same reaction Bitcoiners now have to Darkcoin. Darkcoin is what Bitcoin was originally advertised as, but this time it's real.

I agree that every copycoiner has said this, but if you ignore fundamental features you'll miss the eventual altcoin with actual usefulness. Bitcoin isn't perfect, and never will be.

True, taken to the extreme, there could be a DAC that thinks the best way to make profits is to turn all matter in the universe (including Earth) into money.
New technology is inevitable though so the best plan is to add safeguards  or an "off" mechanism directly into DAC code to use in case of emergencies.

See, this is the actual answer. Instead of trying to treat early adopters like some brave magical heroes who took on ***such horrible risks*** by mining a few hundred bitcoins with their one cpu, we should recognize that the first to find out about the system and understand it were the first to reap the benefits. The first people to join the gold rush would probably make the same rationalization, but the truth is early adopters are simply the people who were at the right place at the right time with the right knowledge and skill to take advantage of a new paradigm.
@_date: 2011-06-13 23:45:27
You forgot a computer science circle. Also, "math" is more specifically "discrete math". I personally know nothing about investing, but as long as you're not an idiot I think you can learn along the way provided you know the other circles.

All of his arguments are bunk. He doesn't address the fundamental soundness of the bitcoin P2P network, only how bitcoin is different from fiat currency.
@_date: 2011-05-31 11:57:49
Don't the same principles that make bittorrent hard to DDOS and take down also make bitcoin pretty secure?
I would have thought the MPAA/RIAA would have tried it already, and they also had a lot of money to attack when they found out about it...
Nonetheless when people understand what's causing delays in the network it won't exactly cause confidence in Bitcoin to drop, it'll just be a selloff to the hackers who understand a P2P network can't really be turned off until you turn off the internet itself.
@_date: 2011-06-09 16:15:18

Why do they *have* to be like anything else in the past? Humans have only developed P2P networks and RSA encryption relatively recently, and few have designed currencies based on these new technologies. They're similar in some ways to fiat currencies but different in other ways. I don't understand the conflict you're having.


No bank is required to send money from one person to another anywhere on the planet nearly instantly. Explain to me how this feature is not an advantage over any other currency.

Every one of his arguments is a treatise on how bitcoin might fail due to problems with traditional fiat currencies, and he uses those arguments to fault bitcoin, even though bitcoin is not a fiat currency by design. It suffers none of the problems of traditional currencies, while reaping all of the benefits by being internet based. It is an abstract, idealized currency backed by military grade encryption.
I see no single point of failure for bitcoin. P2P networks are notoriously hard to destroy. Governments would essentially have to turn off the internet to stop bitcoin. Even if they did, hackers would still figure out how to transmit btc over cell phones or any other means.
The cat is out of the bag, and all of his arguments are both flawed and trivial.

This might be the best comment I've ever seen in my life.
@_date: 2011-06-07 23:06:25


*Some* of your comparisons are flawed in my opinion.


If we say bitcoins obey many of the same rules as gold, then I guess it's completely valid to say it's transactions would probably also obey similar rules, but does that mean "gold==bitcoin" in every way? No.
Your literal comparisons ignore the nuances which make bitcoins a slightly different animal than the rest of the currencies. If that's too general for you, we can go into specifics, but it alarms me that you haven't noticed the obvious differences by now since learning about the bitcoin system.


Only with the assistance of, and at the discretion of Paypal. When dollars themselves start to magically fly at the speed of light across borders without being seen, then we can have a different conversation.

@_date: 2011-06-07 03:59:54
Or they can be viewed as either a currency, or a commodity, or both at the same time, much like gold. Bitcoins are simply relatively rare things with rather useful properties.
The problem with his arguments is he considers the historical problems with currency while brazenly ignoring the technological solutions that bitcoin offers. One needs to understand both in order to accurately evaluate the soundness of the system.
@_date: 2011-06-07 04:42:48
There's a slight difference in meaning between saying bitcoins are like gold and saying bitcoins obey many of the same rules as gold, or diamonds, or gems.
If you claim bitcoins address no traditional problems with current paper-based currencies then you simply do not understand even the fundamentals of the design of the bitcoin system. I therefore see no point to arguing with such a lazy debater.

He's explaining it in an overly complicated way, he doesn't actually need to use those words, but geeks like to show off.
A hash function assigns an ID (ID=hash) to any data given to it. We can assign public IDs to private IDs to secure everybody's money in the bitcoin network. The same principle is used to protect banks against hacking for decades so it's known to be safe.
