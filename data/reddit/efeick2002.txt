You mean hedge fund?
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:30:56
Showed signs of dip with crossing of moving averages on the hourly. I did the same thing as OP. Would rather be cautious. Also bought back in a few mins ago because washington post just released a bullish article

Does  count as art?

Does it take a few days for it to arrive on your initial deposit? What about realized gains?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:03:59
Interesting stuff

There is no way 17% is all because of BTC. If anything the dollar is in a bubble as BTC strengthens

You all have no basis for these negative statements
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:19:10
Has this just been over the past few days?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:18:36
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:22:51
Given the lack of response here, I doubt it. Good find though. Do you know what they said?
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:27:37
The evidence part
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:43:07
I dont but am interested in further investigation. This could however be a peak hours thing and excessive hysteria with all the new buyers + people selling for pretty good gains over the past few months
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:51:04
So what about binance?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:18:45
What your saying is exactly what I dont want to hear. So your saying if I buy on Gdax the purchase takes A FEW DAYS? Therefore I cannot use GDAX to day trade? Is this true? If so where can I trade for real in the USA.

Got it, thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:12:16
I see. What about when you place a buy/sell after you have funds in place. Are those instant?
