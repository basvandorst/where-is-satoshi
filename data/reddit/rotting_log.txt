Was he convicted of that?

Something something past performance future results

Oh great, I cashed out a decent chunk of my ETH last night.

This might be FUD but it sounds like a very reasonable explanation to the recent price surge.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:20:17
No, but the demand would go WAY WAY down if it were completely outlawed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:08:06
Relatively speaking, that is by far a worse dip than the current one.

Just out of curiosity, say this was a real deal you made with someone. How in the hell would you gather 10,000 pizzas?

That's a bit different. That's one of the most widely used drugs being suddenly banned

Yep, same boat. I was 16 when I first got into bitcoin, almost 23 now. Have told my parents "I told you so" about a million times, but also, who the hell takes financial advice from a 16 year old, so I can't really blame them :P

That's metal as fuck
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:34:53
Holy shit

I remember planning on buying like 50+ BTC to buy something on silk road using bitinstant

At the least all the seats should be rear-facing in case of this
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:35:34
Will this reduce transaction fees?
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:35:12
The idea of an atomic swap sounds so cool
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:51:18
Hmm yeah didn't think of that.
Tbh I'd prefer the ability of walking over getting sea sick in the car

Shouldn't be rooting for NK under any circumstances
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:41:31
Why cash out at 250k in may when it's going to be 15 million by August?
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:22:25
Lol what? They don't support crypto withdrawals? no thanks.
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:39:34
Strange how taxation without representation is starting to repeat

Apparently the scientists and engineers are using coding and algorithms

Print out a fake something with the address that's on your ID. That's all they're looking for. Get your coins out asap when they unlock the account.
If you don't want to go that route just keep sending them messages and reach out on their social media. Companies seeing bad review publically is a surefire way to get them to bend over backwards for you.
Best of luck.
