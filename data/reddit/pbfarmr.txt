My original point was that they can’t ‘kill’ a coin by taking out mining capacity.  I then, for the sake of intellectual rigor, conceded the point that they do have the ability to mess with the difficulty.  But if it was done long term, the net effect would be zero - during the net-dif ramp down, blocks would take longer than the target 10 min, while during ramp up, the opposite would be true.  And obviously as soon as a pattern of such behavior emerged, the network/community would move to address the issue.

Still would mean a loss of $0.09 per day:
But to answer your original q, I don’t know where you got yours, but the amazon listing for the v9 states:
“*POWER SUPPLY IS NOT INCLUDED* 
Bitmain recommends using the APW3++ power supply. “
Prob don’t really need 1600w @ 240v, but at least a 1200-1300w supply.

Mining is not dead, but breakeven on investment (for GPUs) is around 1+ year at current difficulties/prices.  That means $1-2/day - not $10 - for top end hardware (before elec costs.). Still quite reasonable, but nowhere near the 2 month breakeven seen at the beginning of the year (assuming you could actually get a hold of the hardware.)
Bitcoin mining is an ASIC game now, forget about it.  Look into alts like ETH, ZEC, LUX, etc.  If you don’t want to hold them, you can trade for BTC, or convert back to fiat.  Though with a single card it will take a long time to mine enough to be worth the fees for transfers/exchanges.
Check out whattomine for a introductory understanding of the value of your card - tho don’t take the data as gospel, as the default settings tend to be for non-optimized cards.

You’re forgetting about network difficulty adjustments.  Shutting off a segment of mining capacity, even an extremely large one, does not ‘kill coin a’.  Even if all ASICS were bricked overnight, it would just mean that GPU/CPU mining is once again feasible.
@_date: 2018-08-12 22:27:37
If they really wanted to fck w/ the network, they could bring capacity on/offline every 2 weeks to keep the difficulty adjusting constantly, but that’s about it...
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:12:51
Yeah - I’m not advocating buying coins.  It’s a great time to mine right now w/ the current market direction.  Just saying if someone’s gonna buy hardware - buy something profitable
@_date: 2018-08-30 07:21:21
Sure, it’s slightly different in that the futures are backed by actual assets, but how can it be ‘the one’, when futures markets (CBOE, CME) already exist?
Are you confusing this w/ ETFs?
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:08:41
Why not buy something profitable now - you can still hodl if desired

Coinbase Pro (aka GDAX) is free for USD ACH transfers, as well as coin transfers.

Depends on electricity costs.  Absolutely worth it for me, and I pay a mid-price $0.124/kWh

Plug it into the garbage bin (tl;dr - those are extremely unprofitable):

Which is what gives it staying power.  Enron was a single company.  Just like webvan or pets.com - individual cos can fail spectacularly, while movements/industries are much more resilient.

Passive income is the key to financial freedom.  Diversified passive income, even better.
That, and leverage.

OP (and my comment) are regarding interest rates, while you’re talking about govt manipulation of money supply.  Still, in general, increased supply =~ lower rates =~ higher utilization (economic activity) =~ higher inflation.  Not sure where the dissonance lies.
And an opinion as to the worthiness of an investment does not invalidate the causal relationship between funds availability (eg due to lower rates) and said investment.
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:04:05
Not disagreeing that low rates encourage consumer spending - just that it’s not the only goal/outcome (increased liquidity, business activity, etc.)
My disagreement is with the idea that savings = investment.  I can save $X from every paycheck by shoving it under my mattress.  That is certainly not an investment.  Furthermore, simply reviewing rates on ‘savings’ accounts shows they are not intended to create wealth or provide future returns, ie the ‘textbook’ definition of an investment.
@_date: 2019-08-12 18:10:30
This ‘purchasing power’ chart keeps getting posted here, but is quite misleading on its own.  It doesn’t take into acct supply, or median household income, or whatever metric one might choose to show how decline in value is offset.
Also, the USD, at least since the loss of gold backing (really since the start of fractional reserves), is clearly not a store of value - at least unbanked.
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:34:44
Low rates are not a bias toward consumption and away from ‘investment’.  In fact it is exactly the opposite - it’s just that your use of the word investment is incorrect. 
High rates encourage ‘storage’, or more specifically the consolidation of wealth under one entity/industry (banking,) while also having an economic cooling effect.  Low rates encourage working capital, aka investment - spreading the wealth across numerous industries.  Popular consumption is of course part of this process, but certainly not the only goal/outcome.
@_date: 2019-08-19 03:24:53
But you’re discounting the demand side of the equation (as well as fractional reserves.) More loans are made not when/because the bank is holding more money, but because demand increases when rates are low.

There’s plenty of proof that it is rather easy to substitute gold with a large number of different substances in its biggest ‘industry’: jewelry.  Yet it continues to be used.
Regardless, this is getting tangential...  not to mention sort of a red herring given that gold was not ‘designed’ to be money, as opposed to (some) cryptos.  
The important discussion is around ‘intrinsic’ value, and I think most people, while debating whether cryptos have any, can’t even define what it means in the first place (or why/whether it even matters.)
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:54:40
Coinbase Pro has no deposit fees (though takes a while to clear,) low order fees for makers and covers transfer fees.  Hard to beat that.
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:35:23
Usefulness as a currency is not an intrinsic value - it is a utility value.
Also your hypothesis on gold is incorrect - it is still widely used for other purposes besides ‘money’ (e.g. jewelry, electronics, etc)
I wrote a few thoughts on the value of cryptos (intrinsic and otherwise) previously, in [another thread...](

I convert to USDC on coinbase pro, then transfer to KuCoin (I’m in US, so options are a bit limited, but KuCoin fees are low, and they’re generally trusted.)
@_date: 2019-12-24 00:45:14
I wouldn’t recommend keeping your assets on any online platform unless it’s for active trading purposes.  I just use coinbase/KuCoin to purchase, then transfer to a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-01 21:22:01
No real insight into coinbase in particular, but young, fast growing tech companies seem to regularly have a bit of turmoil in the exec / early employee ranks.  There’s often a lot of ego / opinion clashes.
Also, you should consider how hot the Bay Area job market is right now - very easy to constantly move to (at least perceived) better opportunities.
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:12:55
Used to be decent, but fees are too high now unless maybe you’re an institutional sized trader.  It’s a good on-ramp for fiat (via coinbase) since withdrawal fees are covered.
@_date: 2019-12-23 20:41:37
I don’t have a problem w/ the KYC on coinbase, but do have one w/ their new trading fee structure.  So my process is now:
1. Fiat transfer to coinbase (free)
2. Convert to USDC (free)
3. Transfer to coinbase pro (free)
4. Withdraw to KuCoin (free)
5. Buy BTC/whatever w/ USDC (cheap)
A little bit convoluted, but easy and cheap...  and KuCoin has no KYC as long as you’re ok w/ a limit on withdrawals (2 btc/day iirc?). Biggest issue is the clearance delay on fiat deposit on coinbase - can take up to 2 weeks.

Ledger nano s (or wait for x).  Otherwise Exodus is a good desktop *multicurrency option where you hold your own keys 
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:32:19
Lol - how high is that horse?  Many newbs are fairly young, and that $60 for a hw wallet is in fact a concern.  As for me, I have a nano - they are not suited for large numbers of small deposits - e.g. from the mining operation I run.
@_date: 2019-01-14 21:07:45
Fair question.  Would personally also love recommendations for alternative non-hw desktop local multicurrency wallets.  I’m not married to Exodus by any means - it’s just the best I’ve seen for these criteria.
@_date: 2019-01-14 20:37:36
Anything allowing you to hold your own keys is more ‘secure’ than an online option.  Not sure what you mean by  and  is up to the user.  2,3,4 &amp; 6 may be concerns, but are not necessarily security issues.
@_date: 2019-01-03 22:48:45
Maybe someone fatfingered their own referral or a mining address.
@_date: 2018-07-30 18:21:49
You sure your rates are actually $.08?  I made this mistake - published rate was $.08, final rate after all the bs fees came to $.124.  Look at your bill if you haven’t already.
Also, there may be rate tiers, where you’re getting a higher rate over a certain threshold.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:14:56
Like you said, eBay (or insert any other big merchant accepting crypto) is not going to hodl.  They will likely do a spot conversion to fiat at time of receipt, minimizing to near zero any cap gain/loss.  Your concern is likely not shared by them.
@_date: 2019-05-16 06:44:08
Yeah - there was some company a couple years ago trying to provide such a service, and I believe their primary target was small business.  No reason it shouldn’t work for larger institutions as well tho.  Can’t remember the name, and think they may have folded in the downturn, but I’m sure a new implementation of the idea will resurface soon, if it hasn’t already.
As to the general public’s awareness of tax treatment, I’m sure you’re right.
