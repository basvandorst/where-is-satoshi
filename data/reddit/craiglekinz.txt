I'm home sick today and I've only been staring at my coinbase app. I think I'm obsessed 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:10:14
I just did this. Watch it hit 17k!
Edit: I used my Christmas money this year to buy bitcoin so I really don't care if I miss out on some profits because I'm having the most amount of fun for $250

Update: WOO BITCOIN FELL TO 16.2K. Never been more excited to have bitcoin drip in my life

I like how I sell at 16.2k, play two matches of LoL, and miss out on $90 profit as it corrects down from 19k to 16k again.

Is there any chance this is just a bubble? I mean is there any reason for the price to go down?

Well. Seems to have been in some kind of bubble
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:09:49
