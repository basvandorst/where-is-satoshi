I am a part of a crypto group for my university and with my old group of friends. Nothin wrong with being in a group of similar minds. It's not like there's a sign that says, "NO BOYS ALLOWED." There's also a "girl hack" group at my work where we can get together and code. Women in STEM. Man Sewing. Advancing Men in Nursing. The Filipino club. IDK. Not much different.

is pretty against bitcoin.

I wouldn't really call it a dip. I mean, you can call it whatever you want. It technically is, but most don't see it that way. If it went to 12k, I'd be more inclined to call it that.

I have no idea lol I'm just talking out of my ass

People say shit like that all the time though. XRP coming to coinbase in 4 days.

This is how my account is. Coinbase is nice and verified but Gdax hasn't verified in 5 weeks.

BTC: 2300 - sold at 16k
LTC: $35 - sold at 98 and bought back some at $149 
ETH: bought at $250 - sold at 500. Bought back at $529.

Congrats I also know people that buy Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:07:46
So many people don't understand this. 20% is 20%. If Bitcoin was $4 and goes up to $4.80, it's the same as $40,000 going up to $48,000. You'll be making the same amount of money.

This is a mining program, not an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:18:11
Could also look into other alts? Transfer some to another exchange and play around with it. normally has lists, just learn about it first and research! Could turn that 0.0x into quite a bit more!
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:03:29
That's the motto of this sub. Don't invest more than you care to lose. If $10 is all you invest, that's ok. If you can't do $500, whatever. No one really cares. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:45:53
Because a lot of people have stakes in xrp and it's under $1 with good tech behind it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 07:41:11
It's FDIC insured (they get hacked, you're not out $$) and extremely user friendly. There's nothing intimidating on there, which is great for people who don't quite understand everything. I'd say it's a good move to make a smallish purchase on there for your first purchase so you can get comfortable with the layout, and understand how sending BTC eth or ltc works.

My dad flipped his lid when he found out I have BTC... "HOW CAN YOU AFFORD THAT?!?!" 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:53:52
It's 15k now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:16:39
Not for me, utilities paid. Plus it was just a 1060. My computer was on all the time anyway. Was just a hobby for a few months.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:06:50
Man that sucks! Give it a couple days and you'll recoup. I bought some at the ATH a month or so ago and was worried. Ha!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:59:54
My Gdax page just shit itself. Yay 16k!
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:32
For a short while. I've been on this pony long enough to know it's only a matter of time before we find out Santa isn't real :( 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:20
the way she goes, boys.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:42
wtf did I just wake up to.

Thank you for asking, I got the same email and I came here to see if there was any news about it. 
The email:
Dear Coinbase customer,
There have been a number of developments with Bitcoin Segwit2x since our last update. No action is required and all funds stored on Coinbase remain safe. 
Last week, the Segwit2x development team announced they would no longer continue with the project. In addition, a significant portion of miners and other community leaders withdrew their support for the fork. However, despite these developments, a small number of miners may attempt to go forward with a fork.
We wanted to provide clarity about the potential outcomes of the fork and what Coinbase will do in each scenario.
To protect customer funds, Coinbase will disable Bitcoin sends and receives at 2 am Pacific Time on November 17th, and disable buys and sells an hour before the fork, which is currently predicted to occur between 6am to 8am Pacific Time on November 17th. All functionality will be re-enabled shortly afterwards.
Scenario 1: Network is unusable
If support for the fork remains at current levels or decreases, the Bitcoin2x network will be unusable. Coinbase will not support withdrawals or trading as it will not be possible to move these assets. Currently we believe this is the most likely scenario.
If the network gains support at a later date, we will enable Bitcoin2x withdrawals from the platform. 
Scenario 2: Network is usable
If transactions are being confirmed at a reasonable speed and miner support is strong, we will allow Coinbase customers to withdraw Bitcoin2x. We will not immediately enable buys and sells as previously stated, but we may enable them at a later date.
We will keep customers updated through our blog.
Thank you,
Coinbase Team

I mean, you can put how ever much you want in it. That was my "noob" purchase. Never dealt with bitcoin before but have been following it since about 2012. I'm happy I did, got me more interested in it. In the last big dip, I threw most of my Christmas present money in it that I had saved up. It will either 1. Go up so we can have a good Christmas or 2. It will crash and burn and everyone will be getting handmade gifts.

Don't gamble money that you can't afford to lose.
If you need to take loans out to afford doing this, that means you don't have it. This plan could very easily backfire.

If I was terminally ill, I'd want to yolo something just like this guy. If he lost anything, who knows, could have a good life insurance policy. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:06:46
I don't want my account to be locked for no reason, and not be able to access the funds. I've been reading too many horror stories recently. I feel safer having control over my wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:13:47
Using Gdax!
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:45:38
You don't need to purchase a whole Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:59:12
What a shitty thing to say. 
I would be thrilled if my father did this for me! Even if it went down the toilet, I at least knew he tried. I grew up knowing I wasn't going to get a penny from my parents for college. I think a lot of us can relate. "Gambling your daughters' future?" IDK I'm pretty sure they can determine their own future. Good for him though thinking about his kids.
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:24:40
Sorry!!! Yeah I just know my luck with that kind of stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:19:51
It has only been about 3 weeks since the last good dip! Patience.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:26:58
Kids are pretty smart. I agree with you. My dad taught me concepts about computers when I was 6 or 7, while they went kinda over my head at the time, it took a little bit to sink in. My nephew is the same way - he can understand some complex things that I didn't know kids could understand. Come to find out it is because if you listen, they have great things to say. Or poop jokes, which are pretty funny.

Female and wife here - I buy Bitcoin (and still mine it. Loving my $1 a day.)
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:40:17
My husband loves looking over my shoulder while I'm checking my portfolio. Needless to say we are pretty ok! Will be a nice Christmas.
