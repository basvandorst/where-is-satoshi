I've owned since $32. I'm just saying, it's clearly not sensible as a hedge against an inflating currency

It usually happens wgile well clear of long term trends. Weve broken through all but the 1 day and 1 week trend. And were toying with those.
Bear in mind, everyone thinks were going up, this time. Theres no doubt. Its a sure thing. Everyones greedy. That sounds like tome for a crash, not a pump.
I still hope were going up, and am in this for the long haul. But dont be surprised when the inevitable doesnt happen.

Not really. the worst case scenario is an unbacked digital currency, identical to bitcoin.

Not on months long projects, to coders with satoshis ability.

Put it this qay, no serious investor is going to bet on bitcoin unless they knew for sure.

Bitcoin just lost 30% in about 12 hours. Your argument is bonkers.

No one loses interest in a billion dollar prize. No one. Something doesnt add up.

OP isn't talking about a military coup, but a concerted propoganda campaign to force trump out of power.

My point is that it goes both ways. Either way youre selecting a timeframe.

Actually, if it follows the exponential trend established, the next stopping point is about $87000. Then we're at around 2 million by 2018, and 200 million by 2020.

Its definitely self fulfiling. The point is, as OP pointed out, the movements happen in inverse proportion to how anticipatible they are, and therefore you camt actually make money from it.

The bigger issue is, why wouldn't people use a system thats otherwise 100% identical, technology wise to bitcoin, but is backed by physical gold or cash?
Worst case scenario, they have something identical to bitcoin.

Went from 8888 to below 6000 in about 12 hours.
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:23:11
The worst case scenario is you just have identical code to bitcoin. Just clone bitcoin. Best case scenario, you maintain the gold reserves and every coin is worth its value in real gold. Worst case, you still have something with all the technological value of bitcoin.

Not necessarily. You can pump an asset by controlling the majority volume and primary exchanges. Simply sell to yourself at an increasingly higher cost, and absorb any third party sells.
@_date: 2017-01-01 06:08:13
Its not reasonable. Possible. But it seems very unlikely someone would put so much work in and not do something simple like back up the keys.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:33:12
Haha. W'ere going down HARD. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:46:07
The market agreed with him, though. It went down, so when he made that comment bitcoin was overvalued.

She threw out the whole computer
@_date: 2016-12-22 22:05:19
Dont fret. I had 6000 btc on a hard drive my mom threw out.

We went through two punp and dumps, first from 200ish to 400ish, then another from 400 to 800ish. They follow clqssic pump and dump patterns of a rqpid rise and then a long sell into the support.

Ehy? Hes specifically addressing people who claim its organic or natural adoption. A 1100-750-1300 move in a few days is proof it isnt. It only reinforces his point.
@_date: 2016-12-30 04:01:28
I'm not saying it is a scam. It's definitely a dubious form of currency. USD has value because the us government gives it value by controlling world political, social and economic resources. 
@_date: 2016-12-22 07:00:48
Or it could be a pump so they can sell into some support before the etf is denied. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:03:19
It doesn't mean it's not a scam. There are plenty of scams where you could have made money.
