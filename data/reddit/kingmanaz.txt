Originally bought in at .62 cents.  That twenty buck investment would currently be worth ~18,800.  Unfortunately, sold when the price was at $17 a few years ago.  Have been building up coins ever since last April, but have been kicking myself for letting go of those 32 coins.

Don't forget South Africa.  Incompetent governments will be sidestepped.

See Switzerland recently de-pegging their Franc from the Euro and the ongoing turmoil in Greece.  If the Eurozone comes apart Bitcoin could be used in lieu of a shared-currency to unify Europe's disparate sovereign currencies.  A similar scenario could unfold in North America instead of an Amero (if such a thing is actually being planned).  The same goes for Asia.  Bitcoin may allow states to retain their national currencies while still facilitating easy exchange.

Looks nice, but a lot of states (including my own) are still unlicensed.  Created an account and hope they e-mail me once they are on-line in Arizona.

Yup.  Bought 32 BTC at .62 cents each through Dwolla and sold at $17.  Didn't think much of bitcoin until the price shot up North of $1000 in November 2013.  I've been dollar cost averaging in over the past year and am currently averaging $400.  Still down but have high hopes for the technology.

1. Business owner owns business.
2. Business receives cash for services.
3. IRS is yet unaware of cash payment to business.
4. Business owner purchases bitcoin in person with cash for service.
5. Business owner does not report bitcoin to the IRS as income for taxation.
Nothing groundbreaking in any of this.  Many small business owners buy classic cars, gold, jewlery, etc., in person with cash to avoid being taxed.
