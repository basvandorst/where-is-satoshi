It is very, very, very easy for malware to log your keystrokes, rendering any encryption worthless.
Online webwallets like blockchain.info with 2FA are safest in my opinion.
Sorry for your loss.

Obviously a knee-jerk reaction to the malleability (non) issue.
Thinking there was a weakness in the core protocol they jumped ship.
Other explanation could be that those were bitcoins stolen from mtgox. Once loaded onto an exchange the mtgox devs could follow them to the exchanges wallet, contact the exchange and have them frozen. The criminals needed to sell them and get their money out fast.

Electrum supports encryption but you need to create a new wallet with the new wallet file type and transfer your coins to that wallet (yes, its inconvenient).
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:55:14
same boat.
give them some time, they have plenty of btc so i wouldnt worry too much.
@_date: 2013-08-23 03:47:49
With new btc entering the market every day (mined), theres no way to essentially "buy all" the btc. Unfortunately, they would have to buy all the bitcoins, every day until 2139. this would actually bankrupt the us gov and destroy the value (depreciate) THEIR fiat money, because they would obviously have to print new funny money to buy all the btc at the ridiculous prices (1,000,000 per coin anyone?). All the while increasing the value of btc. Even in this scenario, it wouldnt mean every hoarder would sell all his btc, so we would still have some btc left in the wild.
And considering we can split bitcoins down to 8 decimal places, people would then just be trading in satoshis and smaller portions.
So.... your wrong.

These posts are cancer.
Regardless of how you look at it, 67 is very cheap. you either gamble that its going down and wait to buy in, or you buy in and gamble were at the bottom. Either way, You assholes saying its going down to 30 are creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. The more you spout that nonsense the more people believe it and wait for it to go down. By waiting and saying "this isnt the bottom, so i'll wait" you are creating that scenario!
If everyone agreed that 60 was the bottom and decided to buy in, guess what? 60 would be the bottom!

So you were talking shit about something you've never used and obviously know nothing about because you heard something about someone losing some shit somehow?
The only people ever losing money online are those too stupid to use 2FA.
No one has ever, EVER, lost any money from an online wallet using two factor authentication. If you're not using 2FA, just take your money out now and flush it down the toilet. At least you will know where it went.
@_date: 2013-07-03 23:58:53
Also consider that this current mini crash could be a controlled crash. Remember that bitcoin is still a relatively small market ($1 Billion) and could easily be manipulated in a period of stagnation (like this) by any millionaire or billionaire with a million (or less) to play with. You spend $200,000 dropping the price by buying down the books when no one is buying, causing a mass panic sell. Then you buy in with $1,000,000 when its down and drive the price back up.
It's easy to make money when you have money.

This is called "freenet" and has been available for years. Unfortunately due to its design it is also fairly slow, just like tor.
Everyone on the freenet network downloads and stores part of the network on their computer, in encrypted format. So the entire network is decentralized, even if one computer goes down, it just loads off another computer.
Its like the torrent of internet.

I hate to say it (as i currently am waiting on a 1k transfer) but it makes more sense to process 100 x $100 transfers than it does to process 10 x $1000 transfers.
That way they are keeping 100 people happy instead of only 10.
When you look at it that way, its hard to get mad about it. yes, I want my money, but I would do the same thing in their position.
@_date: 2013-07-03 23:48:52
Its pretty fucking inconsiderate to keep selling down the books when there is no one buying. If you are a miner all you are doing is hurting your own future profits and the profits of every other miner.
There are many ways to sell off the books (localbitcoins, etc).
There is now a large deviation in terms of difficulty to reward for mining. If these miners were smart they would stop dumping and start holding.
@_date: 2013-12-05 22:24:01
My thoughts exactly. This seems painfully obvious?
The price is always set in Dollars.
We don't set the price of a t-shirt in mastercards or cheques do we? No, in this instance the currency is still the native currency and bitcoin is just a payment option.
If taken quite literally that sentence would not affect merchants from accepting bitcoin at all.

How can you justify a $1000 price tag?
and don't say "well you can buy a btc now for $360 and just save it".
Even $360 is a helluva price tag for a party.
And regardless of what I paid for said btc, if I could have sold it for $1000 but instead gave it to you, then its a $1000 ticket.
What do I get.

Actually, they mentioned that the frequency of the CPU is much higher than the frequency of other elements in the case such as fans, gpu, etc. So those other noises could be filtered out, leaving just the CPU range.
They have patched this, but there are still going to be those using older versions and with increases in recording technology this still may be a threat. Something to keep in mind.
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:12:44
To everyone saying "Gox is going down! Get ur shit out!"
What you should realize is; that if gox goes down, the entire bitcoin ecosystem takes a large step backwards. This means your bitcoins will lose value and you will lose profit on any appreciation that would have happened.
Why can't you near-sighted fools see this?
What do you think will happen if a large segment of the bitcoin investment population loses their investment? That's money that is lost forever, never to be reinvested in bitcoin. Those are many people that will most likely never support bitcoin again.
Stop. Talking. Shit.
It's for your own good. Fuck.
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:10:38
I am so sorry to hear this.
I sort of know how you feel as I've lost a sizeable chunk of someone elses money before.
You don't want to hear this but one of the greatest strengths about bitcoin is also its greatest risk; that is being your own bank. Sending money to an account that doesnt have 2FA is like leaving a stack of cash on your doorstep and closing your door for the night. You are just waiting for someone to come along and take it.
Most people have malware on their computer without even knowing it, regardless of any anti-virus software they have.
I would dare say the majority of us do. Anyone thats ever downloaded games or apps from torrent sites or browsed some sketchy websites probably has something.
This is a really shitty situation, theres nothing we can really say to make it better. What you can do is get more money (even if its only 3k), put it into bitcoin, and when it goes up in value to equal the initial 18k you can sell it out and pay everyone back.
It may not look like it, but things will work out in the end.
@_date: 2013-08-21 10:26:07
I have to agree. most people are spreading fud and repeat the same bullshit about their 2.9m from dwolla. Why do people think their dwolla transfers made up so much of their cash flow? ive always used bank transfers.
Besides after this many years im sure gox has a pile of btc as big as a mountain by now.
@_date: 2013-09-18 19:11:35
This is pure speculation and not helping matters at all.
If gox goes down, you lose, whether you have bitcoins/cash on gox or not. So shut the fuck up. People have a way of bringing about things when they repeat them enough.
@_date: 2013-10-11 17:07:51
That is not a loss from their blockchain.info wallet but of their wallet file itself. This is exactly how a local encrypted wallet is weak. Blockchain directly asks you if you would like your wallet sent to your email. It is up to you if you would like to have it sent to you. Most people say "i'll back up my wallet to dropbox or gmail and it will be safe as long as i encrypt it!". Which is wrong.

This does NOT point to that, and spreading FUD like that can only potentially hurt those who have fiat stuck on gox.
It has been explained many times now, that their current banking partner(s) have limited the amount of money they can wire each day.
After being indicted on anti-money laundering laws how easy do you think it will be to walk into a new bank and set up an account?
They've obviously been blacklisted by US banks.
Bitcoin is in direct opposition to banks and everything they stand for and mtgox is the biggest/easiest target.
@_date: 2013-08-21 10:10:02
are you fucking kidding me?
last month i paid gox over $1000 usd in fees and im only working with roughly 20k usd (a lot of trading). You think one dude (me) is responsible for 2% of mtgoxes fees?
The feds seized 2.9 mill of goxes money. You think they worked 58 years (2,900,000 / 50,000) to get that money? You think that was all of their money? that was only from people who used dwolla.
Gox has the best position out of any of the exchanges, they charge the highest fees and they have practically a monopoly.
The most likely answer is that their new banking partners have limited their withdrawals to certain amounts per day due to regulatory limitations. This will be alleviated as time passes.

ok ok, but that is a hypothetical and we would like to assume that the people running these online wallets know what they're doing.... would like to...
I believe that web wallets also provide security by obscurity as well. As someone would have to expend significant resources to see whats in your wallet. Conversely, they wouldnt spend significant resources unless there was a lot in your wallet.
This is also not assuming a MITM attack on all users at once. In which case, everything goes out the window as they no longer need to know which wallets have funds.

@_date: 2013-10-11 16:15:13
Don't say alarmist things like that. Web wallets are perfectly safe as long as you use 2 factor authentication.
In fact, an encrypted wallet on your computer is less safe than a wallet stored on blockchain with 2FA. Most people have viruses on their computers without even knowing it. Some virus creators specifically look for wallet files and download them off victims computers. This allows them to brute force your wallet with no time constraints. Whereas blockchain doesnt get viruses and doesnt have access to your wallet.
@_date: 2013-07-04 16:15:50
Maybe you forget that anyone buying bitcoins for any reason, even to just delete them into nothingness, help by reducing the supply and so increase the value. Let people hoard. It's good for all of us.
The problem lately has been too much supply and no demand.
More people need to get greedy.
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:49:33
This is quite true.
Unfortunately, In terms of general users It would seem more likely to be the victim of trojans/keyloggers from that copy of bioshock 3 you torrented.
In these cases, 2FA would save your livelihood. An encrypted wallet isnt worth shit if they know your password. Where as i can give my password out to every single person i meet and it wont do shit.
I put more faith in a password that changes every 30 seconds that neither I nor my attacker knows.
As far as i'm aware, no local encrypted wallets support 2FA.

**I included the 0.001 trade fee on all orders.**
The first 20 btc transfer showed up on the blockchain roughly 14 hours later. The second 20 btc showed up roughly the same time. The third 9.9 btc transfer has yet to show up, 21 hours later.
Both the first and second transfers have yet to be confirmed 10 hours after appearing on the blockchain.
Both the first and second transfers appeared on the blockchain with **NO FEES ATTACHED.**

I think the overrall point of bitcoin is to replace banks with a one world currency.
Obviously we are not near that point yet. But we are almost at the point that if you can be paid in bitcoin, you can survive off bitcoin. You can buy a house, a car, buy groceries, pay for vacations, eat at restaurants/bars etc...
We are getting there.
@_date: 2013-08-21 10:15:54
Stop spreading bullshit. You do understand that by buying btc at this overinflated price and taking them off gox, you are HELPING gox by providing them with capital which they can use to pay other customers withdrawals? Assuming this is a lack of funds issue and not a financial regulation issue (which is the more likely cause).
Ask yourself, how much does your bank allow you to withdraw a day? my limits $600 from a machine, if i go in person i can get whatever i want, but if its over 10,000 it becomes a a lengthier process and questions are asked. If i get hassled for removing 10k, what do you think the banks expect when you want to withdraw 200k per day to 100 different accounts all over the world?
Why is that so hard to understand? 
Give them time.

My comment history? you mean the last 3 comments i made in this thread? yes.. history indeed. I have a significant investment on gox, it is in my best interests to inform stupid people that they are only making things worse for both themselves and myself alike.
Your recap "history" is slightly inaccurate but regardless there are many reasons to not have confidence in mt gox, yes. But people yelling "the sky is falling! the sky is falling" is not helping the situation.
Their published exchange rate is not "fantasy" it is the exact value of a bitcoin on the next highest exchange (roughly 126ish) plus the added value of risk/inconvenience of not being able to exchange those funds for USD in the short term (+10% ish).
My advice, take your funds in btc sure, but dont sell them for a loss unless you seriously need the money in your hands. Also don't spread FUD and bullshit about gox. Let them deal with their shit and hope for your sake and mine that they get things sorted out. Even if you don't like gox or you are butthurt that you sold your coins for a loss, talking shit about them will benefit neither you nor the community in the long run.
