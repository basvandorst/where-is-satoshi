Just tell them "Its none of your business. If you do not want my money someone else will !" 
Your not doing any crime. You spend your hard earned money and pay your taxes.

The world is run by Keynesians who only focus on the short term, print money, accumulate debt, and whos biggest fear is deflation. 
If you think about it, real money should become more valuable over time, cause we have new technologies which drive the production costs down, and make society as a whole more prosperous.

Lower transaction costs for the merchants mean higher profits in that sector, wich attracts more merchants, and their competition drives the price of the good down and the quality up. 
Thats how the free market operates.

I've been using BTCJam for a little more then a year, and about 70 % of all my loans are defaulted and I lost about 1,2 BTC in total. BTCJam is basicly a hub for scammers and I'm not gonna use it again. I sugest you do the same until they find a way to make the arbitrage work or provide some colleteral .
