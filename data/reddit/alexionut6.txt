Is anything normal with bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:49:16
@_date: 2019-11-08 16:28:19
Oh you're right. My bad mate.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:43:36
Cheers mate. Hope you're still around. ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:30:23
Makes sense, but they should cash in too on their gains. Why follow blindly only one way?
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:25:15
Well, that was awesome timing. You can buy almost 9 now from all that profit. Nice dude.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:40:21
Cheers mate. Hope you're still around. ;)
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:09:45
Yeah, or the whole world would just turn insecure and nobody would leave the house anymore. Lol
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:49:05
Yeah, you're perfectly right sir.
@_date: 2019-10-24 00:41:36
Are you implying this strategy is wrong? I applied it when bitcoin dropped from 13.9 k. Sold at around 12k and few people started losing their s**t like i was doing the biggest mistake in my life. 
Worked out fine in the long run as i'm planning to buy back soon everything o've sold.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:50:05
You we're there for me buddy so here we go.

Just in case you need it.
@_date: 2019-10-24 09:17:51
Sure buddy.
On a more serious note, man i was starting getting sick and tired of "Hodl hodl hodl" with no reason and fake hopes. It's good to see things from a different perspective.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:47:41
Agreed with you, but I'd like to believe that some if not most people around here are good human beings that would help with an advice/productive critique a fellow Redditor.
@_date: 2019-10-26 02:07:48
Of course. But to be fair, I bought less than I had thinking it will get lower. My bad xD
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:17:14
Wow, nice man. Keep it growing. Good luck! ��
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:47:34
Fare enough, they are looking for the "bigger fish" but why not expand in the meantime?
If somebody handed you 10k and you had the chance for transforming that 10k in 100k with some risks, wouldn't you do it? Well, I would.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:42:32
Yeah, makes sense.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:30:41
Same has flipping my friend.
@_date: 2019-10-24 17:12:33
You misunderstood me. I never meant to sell everything and never buy again. I only meant people can easily increase their amount of bitcoin by selling when it drops and buy back at a lower price. It doesn't take a genius to see that selling at 12k and buying at 7k it's profitable. I mean the amount get almost doubled. You had 1 bitcoin? Bam! Now you got almost 2. It's simple math after all.
I kept presenting my idea for a while now yet most still don't see my point of view. For me, it makes no sense to just wait and hope to get rich. I want to do something actively for that to happen.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:50:40
Because a lot of people keep selling using same thought process as me. 
If you don't believe it's gonna get lower, please save this post and message me in a few days/weeks.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:47:07
So in your opinion i should've kept hodling and hope it gets big again instead of selling at 11k then rebuy at &lt;11k? 
Think about it. Even if i buy back at 9k i made a lot of profit.
So where is my mistake?
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:48:57
Still remains a lot of profit after taxes tho'.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:57:50
I hope you won't need it, man. Just a stupid joke.
I about to buy back again so I just remembered this post.
I hope I didn't offend you.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:02:38
Makes perfect sense. But isn't questioning our decisions, the thing that helps us improve the most?
Why look only in one direction?
Maybe I'm just insecure and this is why i question everything.
@_date: 2019-10-24 05:59:34
You too mate. All the best.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:42:29
It's the hope. I was exactly in the same place. But i decided this is best for me. 
Don't cry Bitcoin, i'll be back once you're a bit more slim.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:52:35
You clearly didn't read. I'm not out. Definitely gonna buy back when it gets lower.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:20:09
Agreed with you, i'm no expert indeed. But it takes no expert to see the amount of profit available here. Risk is minimal. Even if i bought back now i would be 10-15% profit. But i keep hodling for now. 
Why people get mad when they can make more money both short and long term?
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:03:35
I agree with you. The bottom line is making educated guesses it's the best we can do and acting when the time is right instead of just waiting to get rich.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:48:15
Don't worry man. I'm not out yet. Gonna buy back when it gets lower. Just made some profit for now.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:20:54
I won't. Will see how things progress for the next few days/weeks. Just checked. Seems to keep going down. 10.8k atm.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:58:12
Ahh, i was thinking to keep some but i went on instinct. We'll see next days/weeks if i was right.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:30:04
I feel you, man. The shit posts gets to me also. I always see "hodl" or "to the moon" for not good reason and when bitcoin shows clear signs of going lower. We should do something about these shitposts indeed. Cheers
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:51:08
No worries, profit is pretty big.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:06:39
This post was meant for people who seek some sort of guidance. Everybody is saying hodl bit to what avail, to lose even more money. 
Please answer me truthfully: if you were in my shoes, what would've been your decision?
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:04:56
Altcoin is not my cup of tea. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:13:56
Not from US.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:06:44
I admit i am in a small risk but chances are big for me to stay with the profit and buy back the same amount of bitcoin maybe even invest more off profits.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:15:44
I'm 'in' with the spirit. Semantics man. Does not matter at all. Will buy back soon so, yeah...
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:52:17
I did already. When it was 12k. Gonna rebuy after it f
Drops some more.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:42:19
Feels bad man. I just sold all my btc and when i advised people to sell and rebuy i got a lot of mixed opinions 
Check 
If you want to have a laught.
@_date: 2019-10-24 06:05:30
I'd say "Now!" in a heartbeat but the price seems to go lower. 
See how price evolves and try to buy at around 7k if bot lower.
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:10:35
Is not yet over my friend. My time shall come, i know it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:28:16
I hope as well someday it will reach 6 figures. But investing my profit as well at around 6k i would have an extra 50% bitcoin and at 9k 25% extra bitcoin. So I don't see how this affect my long time investing just because I want to increase the amount of bitcoin I will have.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:36:53
Nothing wrong. But why not work to get even richer instead of just waiting?
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:19:53
Appreciate it buddy but i won't be the case. I'mma be a rich man soon.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:00:32
It matters if you want to make profit and it every amount adds up. Therefore everyone matters even us, the small sellers.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:01:30
I kept thinking what strategy would be to keep on hodling but i haven't found any advantage in it.
@_date: 2019-10-24 16:21:06
That's great to hear. Keep it going, man. Buy discounted Bitcoin while you can. ;)
Edit: Those Lambos are amazing, btw and I'm sure are the right size for you. You should hurry and buy fast or you might not even afford those. GL, ;)
