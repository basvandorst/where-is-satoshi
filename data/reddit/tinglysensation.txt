you'd be surprised how often this happens. Sometimes you don't have time to test something as fully as possible when you are bleeding money. Worked with a developer before who was part of a banks fire fighting team, where they pretty much did quick fixes and passed on the error to a different team to get the right fix done.

Could they be doing this in order to make the price of Bitcoins drop so they can buy up and replace what was lost?

would people go back to using gox if they reopened? I would hope that boat has sailed, but I don't know how much people particularly care about Mt Gox vs BTC-E or Krakken or what have you.

So- if you bought a pizza with bitcoins, you would have to pay VAT once for the bitcoins, and the second time for the pizza?
How do they handle gift card taxation?

ah, I never noticed that, I do not have level 2 Verification yet. How long does a transaction take if it is not instant?
Edit: I am really new to this... Apparently if you click on the "Pending" icon, it will tell you when you will receive BTC. It seems to take around 5 days for the funds to appear in the users wallet until they are "Level 2"

Does VAT only apply to financial transactions?
If so, then you would pay vat when purchasing bitcoins, and shouldn't be changed vat when purchasing something with those bitcoins.

I dunno, I bought a part of a bitcoin over 24 hours ago, and that is still pending.

I'd be curious to see if the hype has any effect. A situation that seems like it might be analogous would be when the Fukushima disaster happened. Supposedly, the cost of these tablets that were supposed to help with radiation poisoning apparently skyrocketed in the US because of all the hype. 
I am unable to provide a source as this happened a while ago, and the only reason I know about that at all is because a friend somehow took advantage off of that market and claimed he made money off of it. I have no way of confirming, but it does make sense.

What I want to know is where people are getting all these coins with the BTC symbol on it- I wouldn't mind having a few just for fun.

I am curious to know how a laptops microphone could pick up ultrasound at all? I didn't think they had that sort of range. A standard mic used has the range of 20hz to 20khz- all within the range of what you can hear, though I suppose you might not hear it if you weren't listening for it?
One way to test for this is to simply disconnect the laptop's microphone.

Where is the ASIC for LTC? I would like to see this, last I knew, they didn't even have a decent FPGA that wasn't outperformed by a video card, which heavily suggests that there isn't an ASIC, but I could be wrong.

I don't think I'd have an issue if the bank let the transaction float and contacted me to determine if the transaction was legit. If a transaction sets off red flags, and they allow me to whitelist it- I'd be fine with that. Kudo's to your bank for taking a balanced approach.

Oh wow, those are really expensive...

So, basically accept payment from CoinBase or BitPay like you would accept payment from PayPal?

I have heard that hearing deteriorated, though is it with everyone? I am 28 and can hear almost all of the 20-20k range. Only end I have any trouble with is the really low end, which could be my head phones

but I like barefoot shoes, and I'm not a tycoon...

Google is really good at figuring out their users. What you are seeing is an ecosystem tailored to you, where your interests with Dwolla seem to be primarily based around bitcoin.
That doesn't prove what dwolla said was true, but it also does not disprove it.

I wouldn't complain if more places started accepting rent, or maybe grocery delivery services like PeaPod.

Use the normal light as well. There are strips in money that tell you which denomination it is- so a combination of one of those money checking sharpies and holding it up to the light should tell you with a decent degree of certainty if it's legit- if you don't have the money for all of the high tech stuff.

I've closed my account and requested they completely purge their database of any of my banking information. Since I am not particularly interested in using them for anything else at the moment, I'm not willing to risk my bank account info getting stolen needlessly.

Bad news about the KNCminers- apparently there are a few that seem to be blowing capacitors
