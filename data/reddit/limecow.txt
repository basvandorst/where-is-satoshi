How can you say that so confidently when bitfinex doesn't even know the original attack vector?
@_date: 2016-08-17 23:17:17
Okay, so you'll be able to answer this. Bitfinex says that the exact methodology is the attack is not known. You say that the vulnerability that made the attack possible is now gone. Does this mean that you actually do know the methodology of the attack or does it mean that you are claiming to have removed the vulnerability without actually knowing what it is?

How the fuck do you people actually believe that Ulbricht should be pardoned? Fucker got what he deserved.

I lost my shit when I saw that. How can she expect people to respect her privacy when she ruined some poor man's life with a fake story to get page views? She posted this guy's address, name, families name and even a picture of her house, and somehow she thinks she deserves privacy.

In this case, the link in the email actually lead to coinbase. If this is the same attack as a few months ago (which it likely is), then the URL in the email simply leads you to a legitimate coinbase page to give an illegitimate OAuth application maliciously named "Coinbase" full access to your account.

There was a time where coinbase account emails could be leaked very easily because of the way they chose to handle sending funds by email. Not sure if that's still the case

A big reason why people use the API in the first place is so that they can have their trading handled by a bot. Requiring a 2 factor key for each API action sort of eliminates the purpose.
