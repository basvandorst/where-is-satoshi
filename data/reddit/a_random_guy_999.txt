Buy it and then what? don't be dumb. Just because there is low supply that doesn't mean everyone would want it. If there is no use case for btc in the future, no one will want it

I think we are doomed. People had a chance to get out at 13.9k and whoever got out, got lucky just like when it was 20k. Hope is very dangerous

What is up with all these salty people here �� did they buy at 13k ?
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:44:24
Alright I'm out of here. I'll see you guys back at 3k or lower

It's hard to believe but I think crypto is slowly dying. No positive news and basically regulators and big boys are against it. What makes you guys think prices will go up even in long term. Give me one reason you believe Bitcoin or eth or any of these alts go up in the future ? I am curious to see how everyone is thinking

Why is no one talking about Satoshi reveal tomorrow?

@_date: 2019-06-26 18:59:46
Yo holy shit I'm scared now. Will it go up or is there gonna be a huge drop soon ?
@_date: 2019-06-20 18:40:57
It wont be long before bitcoin makes 9.4 k it's bitch
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:23:19
Aaaaannnnnnd it's back down
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:07:27
Literally can't go tits up
