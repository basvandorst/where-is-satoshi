You're totally right about that too. If it is difficult to get investors, then there are serious issues with the project itself. Of this you can be sure. But the ideas behind can still be great. It isn't like every project is proposing the uber for pets or some ridiculous idea.

So for your opinion (if I'm understanding correctly), you mean to say that even if there are good blockchain-based projects out there, they don't need to have their own token or coin at all? If that is the case, should such projects only accept BTC or also fiat currencies? Cheers and thanks a lot for pointing out some really informative opinions and ideas. I truly appreciate it.

which points to the problem of fiat itself: how can there just continue to be printing of money?? it makes the game impossible to catch up to when a fixed-supply currency comes along. economically, BTC makes more sense to me because it is fixed in supply. am i wrong?

why do you think that? it's a very interesting perspective. just as we see how altcoins benefit from the rising btc price, wouldn't there be similar upward pull factors for btc if altcoins represented an obvious and powerful majority of total trading volume? i know these conversations have been talked about ad nausea. just want to know if maybe i'm way off base here

Wow, such brilliant points honestly. Thanks a ton for elucidating your opinion on the matter. I never thought of it like this, and often see projects out there with a native token or coin thinking how useful it could be. 
I like the notion of utility tokens when they solve a problem, and they are justified in existing because any other way would undermine the system in which the token was created to begin with. That's how I see it. That in mind, there are SOOO many scams out there as opposed to actual working products that are looking to make a difference.

Thanks a ton for the suggestion. I really appreciate it. So in other words, what is BTC to you?

I couldn't agree more. I don't think any fiat stands a chance when stacked up to BTC or even other altcoins for payments. It just surprised me so much that this was the result when not everyone on that platform in particular is big into crypto.
@_date: 2019-03-21 13:08:13
do you really think so? and do you think that there are other fiats out there (say euro or sterling) that can stack up even to the dollar, and somehow flank BTC from the dominant position upon which its technology uplifts it? i could see that happening as well with the euro for example. 
also, if BTC became the world reserve currency, then as you so rightfully mention it would need to be more stable. some people posit when this could happen. what do you think? is it at the moment when there are no more BTC available? at the moment when other altcoins jump onto the scene?

Ya I see your point. I guess what I'm getting at is the simple reality: with increasing payment systems on social platforms, the likelihood of hacking becomes greater. Through centralization, it always leaves the social platforms and their users vulnerable. On the other hand, blockchains are now hackable apparently, as I've seen in recent reports. 
The question I've asked implies that data breaches would take place in the payment side of social platform features. Apologies for not making that more clear. Cheers

So overall, you'd be willing to say that BTC wouldnt' solve social platform data issues? What about other altcoins for data marketplaces? Don't you think that would bridge the gap between deceptive data collection practices from the big tech giants and users who want privacy?
