Because people are paying for the simplicity of the Coinbase process and using GDAX to perform this currency change involves more steps than the average person is comfortable with. Remember, we're trying to bring cryptos to the masses here, not just tech and finance people.

Ok, got it. You might realize this already, but national wealth is *not* wealth held by the US Federal Government. It is the total wealth of *all citizens of the US*. This has nothing to do with our trillion dollar budget deficit, which means that the US Federal Government is spending $1T more than it taxes this year.
The federal government has somewhere in the area of $3-4T worth of assets - a very large portion of which is actually crap student loans (~$1.5T).
