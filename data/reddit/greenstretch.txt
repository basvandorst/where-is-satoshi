Not sure if this is a good omen or a bad one.  He got REKT in the dotcom boom and crash, but may have been right about some things in the long run.  " He declared Global Crossing his favorite stock, and staked his financial future on it. While he avoided investing in practically every company he wrote about because of the potential for charges of conflict of interest, this was a notable exception. "Global Crossing going bankrupt?" Gilder asks, a look of disbelief on his face. "I would've been willing to bet my house against it." In effect he did. Just a few years ago, he was the toast of Wall Street and commanded as much as $100,000 per speech. Now, he confesses, he's broke and has a lien against his home. " [

Thank you.  u/BashCo .  People in cryptospace often recommend internet resources, but there are so many kooks and scammers that it's better for a completely new person who is willing to take the time to read a book that provides more context and \_Digital Gold\_ is very clear in presenting the basic idea of bitcoin and the initial story of its founders.  The other books cover more ground and some are more recent, but they don't have the same narrative drive to keep a new person engaged.  And of course everyone can agree on Andreas as an internet resource (or his \_Internet of Money\_ books).  Since things do move so fast, it's important for people to "get it" as soon as they can.  \_The Bitcoin Standard\_ is excellent, but someone who is not receptive to libertarianism or Austrian Economics might be put off by it.

Even Trump and his supporters present him as a decisive person who forms gut impressions, as in his recent meeting alone with Kim.  There is nothing that has come out that says that he reads or even pays attention to detailed briefings.  In his younger, more vigorous days as a developer, he may well have walked around his sites, examining materials and work in great detail, but he's not doing that now.  He has not done the natural smart thing and focused on his strength, developing infrastructure, as he promised throughout the campaign.  This would have won bipartisan support and this should have been apparent to him from his following the political talk shows.  Most people in general have not paid close enough attention to understand bitcoin and nothing about Trump suggests he's ready to become part of the minority who do.

"The people of Israel believed themselves to be God’’s favourite children, and when the great Father hurled visitation after visitation upon them, it still never shook them in this belief or caused them to doubt His power and His justice; they proceeded instead to bring their prophets into the world to declare their sinfulness to them and out of their sense of guilt they constructed the stringent commandments of their priestly religion. It is curious how differently a savage behaves!

The banknote became invalid after 31 December 2013. However, on 15 March 2006, the Riksbank introduced a new, more secure 1,000\-krona banknote with the same portrait and the Riksbank became the first central bank in the world to use the security feature of "Motion" \(a moving image in the striped band\) on the new 1,000\-krona banknote. When the banknote is tilted, the picture in the striped band appears to move.[\[24\]]( The Vasa banknotes with the security thread became invalid after 30 June 2016.

Bitcoin is an absolutely global market so there is no way to keep up with it in person.

Thank you for your detailed reply.  I couldn't see why the present owners of assets like art would want to do this, but your idea that the market becomes bigger when trying to sell makes sense.  It was more the case of assets like retirement accounts that are currently protected by custody arrangements and insurance like FDIC or SPIC in certain cases.  Tokenization would seem to make these assets more vulnerable to hacking than they currently are where there are human actions all through the process.  Potentially corruptible human actions, so investors' calculations may change over time.

"There are, of course, plenty of alternative views — especially from those who profit from old-school active investing. Still, you can imagine that if every investor in the world held pretty much the same investments — well, what would that lead to? A research note from the investing firm Sanford C. Bernstein argued that passive investing is, “worse than Marxism,” in that it threatens the legitimate give-and-take that is central to any market. Ken French again:
FRENCH: One of the beautiful things that happens out there in the market is price discovery, and I would never argue all prices are right, but prices are pretty darn good. We learn an awful lot about how resources should be allocated from what the prices are in the financial markets. If nobody is doing price discovery, we lose a really valuable service. What I always say is, “If it’s somebody I don’t like, I’m more than happy to have them go out there and spend their money investing actively because as a group, they’re making the world better off.”

It takes a long time for books to catch up to the news online, but they're great for giving a framework for thinking about crypto.  1. Digital Gold by Nathaniel Popper   The best straightforward chronological history of the main bitcoin players I've read.  He also has many crypto articles in the New York Times 2.  Age of Cryptocurrency  by Paul Vigna and Michael J. Casey  a little wider ranging and less focused than Popper by two Wall Street Journal reporters (at least when they wrote the book).  If I'd read these books when they first came out in hardcover in 2015, I'd be rich today.  3. Cryptoassets by Chris Burniske and Jack Tatar   This October 2017 book tries to use more traditional tools of financial analysis to see crypto as a new asset class of value to investors.  The first four chapters are kind of lame if you don't already have the basic story, but the real meat in the later chapters is excellent.  4. How Money Got Free, Brian Patrick Eha   May 2017 I haven't finished this one yet, but gives a lot of depth to the people he interviewed: Roger Ver, Charlie Shrem, Barry Silbert, Nick Cary.

That reminds me of a blog post I once saw about an American who'd moved to Canada and was talking mostly about the things he liked better in his new country.  Once a young Iranian born immigrant was talking to him and asked him if he had a tattoo that was currently hidden.  He did and out of left field writes that he'd done some porn before moving to Canada.  I thought the Canadian attitude was typified by his next story when he says he told a coworker about having been in porn movies.  "Oh, I knew that, but I didn't know if you wanted to talk about it."

HODL,  if you have to ask about trading it's not for you.  Not for me or most people either.

How many other fiat currencies could a Venezuelan HODLR sell into?  And someone who has USD or another fiat currency could either buy directly with that or buy Bolivares to pay for short term needs.

u/NerdBuddha  How serious is the crime situation?  I've seen survivalist things from there, but am not sure if these particular guys are just obsessed or everyone is scared.  [  I also saw a British expatriate blogger living in Argentina who compared murder rates in in Buenos Aires with other large cities in the Americas and only Toronto was better. As soon as I formulated the thought that most murders in all these places are probably between guys who live in the different cities and work in the drug trade, he came out with a story of being robbed by 5 guys, which is what I would assume is what most visitors have to worry about  anywhere outside a war zone.

From a September article being republishes as a "told you so":  " In this scenario, we have tapped the 5.8k support level multiple times now. The average retail trader has likely longed 5.8k-6k and placed a stop below, in case we do break this support. This means that there is tons of liquidity below the 5.8k level that has not been tapped yet. Why is this important? When larger players (think institutions) need to fill their massive orders, they need to target areas that have lots of liquidity to avoid price moving up on them while they are trying to accumulate. Since there are plenty of stop sells below the 5.8k support level the larger players know that if price makes it into this range it will trigger a stop run and those retail positions will auto-sell en masse, filling the pockets of the larger players with the least amount of slippage. If this really is near the bottom, the larger players will likely push price below 5.8k one last time to fill their positions before we head up for the next wave. " [

Thank you, that's good I thought some of this exaggerated.

Those old people have to read some more and check out a few other sources before they're convinced to buy in and then they have to figure out how to do that.

Great exposure.  Virtually everyone started as a doubter so this will bring more people in.  The $800,000,000 pizza bill for Laszlo in the teaser turned out to be several purchases, not just the one famous one.

Right, but I think it's more likely a small closed group thinking of contingency plans if their budget stops being funded than an overarching government plan.

I wouldn't think "The Government", but I wouldn't be surprised if it were a project of a small group of NSA cryptographers.
