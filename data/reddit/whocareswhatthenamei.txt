There will always be a place for FIAT currency. 
$0.35 purchases in FIAT scale up.no problem for stores. Thrift, restaurant, discount, gas station. 
If you ran a dollar store.and took Bitcoin you'd lose every cent to TX fees

why do finance outlets like this obsess over investing into assets that have already made the jump in price? then report on it for weeks? 
like dude you're late to the party

There was a Bitcoin crash between 2012 and 2017 though. And you don't know the future of BTC right now. 
You said end of 2012 $10k 
Yet we're here 5 years later barely at 3.5k.....so they.were right....you didn't get the roi you expected

this is exactly what i got word for word: 
Update for customers with BTC stored on Coinbase
Dear Coinbase Customer,
We are contacting you to make you aware of recent developments in a number of proposals for technical changes to Bitcoin. All BTC stored on Coinbase will remain safe during these events described below.
The User Activated Hard Fork (UAHF) is a proposal to increase the Bitcoin block size scheduled to activate on August 1. The UAHF is incompatible with the current Bitcoin ruleset and will create a separate blockchain. Should UAHF activate on August 1, Coinbase will not support the new blockchain or its associated coin.
The User Activated Soft Fork (UASF) is a proposal to adopt Segregated Witness on the Bitcoin blockchain and could result in network instability. It is scheduled to activate at the same time as the UAHF.
To ensure the safety of customers’ funds, we will temporarily suspend BTC deposits, withdrawals, and buy/sell starting approximately 4 hours before activation of either fork.
If you do not wish to have access to UAHF coins, and do not wish to access your BTC during the fork, you are not required to take any action.
If you do wish to have access to UAHF coins or access your BTC during the fork, you should send your BTC from Coinbase to your external address by July 31. 
For more information on these potential Bitcoin forks, please refer to this article: 
Thank you,
Coinbase Team

yeah most of it was from freebits that people gave to me to try out. but i was reading the xapo fee schedule and it was not based on data size, it was based on bitcoin amount sent

i've been looking at other wallets and they all seem to have their own fees in addition to mining fees. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 04:32:17
To send what /how much? 
50 cents to send like 900 faucet payouts that adds up to like $5 
Or $0.50 to send like one transaction?
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:11:14
what are some good ones?
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:02:24
that's what im saying, that's in addition to miner fees

alright, it seems like you're a little iffy on english. 
and you're unaware with how things work in the US. 
so basically, bitcoin price isn't stable. one day it's $800 then in two years it's $2900...
so the problem is miners don't want to process orders for free meaning that a HUGE segment of bitcoin transactions are not fiscally worth it. 
if i sell you $10 worth of bread but it costs you $9 worth of bitcoin in fees to process that because you sold 5 people $2 worth of eggs to get the $10 you want to pay me then it's not a feasible economy
it's not a complaint it's an observation, if you don't spend btc in huge chunks one at a time then it has no value
which means as people use it  more and more of their value is stuck in their account worthless
does that make sense?
and there is only a finite amount of BTC out there, but since small increments are not worth transferring it's dead coin. 
sure $3 worth of bitcoin in one account is nothing, but if you have 100 millon accounts out there with $3 worth of bitcoin that nobody wants to touch since the fees are so high then your currency is killing itself off.
i can pay someone in pennys and nickels in america. 
it doesn't just disappear because i spent lower than the threshold of minimum currency to tax.

I'm sorry for asking such a stupid question, but what are keys? and what is the best wallet (free?) where i have accsess to my keys?
Im currently thinking about selling my BTC through coin base (they do instant to USd) then come back after the dust settles, worst idea?
