I think what you're referring to are DEXs. You login via your key and you can now trade. The keys cannot be stored in Ledger (for now) though so you still have to make sure your PC does not get compromised.

Congrats man! Welcome to the Club!

Another edit. In monetary evolution, "cryptocurrencies lead by Bitcoin in 2008" lead should be led. 
Anyway, great site man! I wish you could add more info on that one. Maybe the less technical ones will be placed on top and scrolling down for more info, it gets more and more technical.
@_date: 2018-06-16 02:57:01
This makes me happy that older people are into cryptocurrencies also.
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:54:12
I would also like to know how run a node. What is the specs of your laptop?

I don't know what sport you bet on but I want to know if you won or lost :)

Technically, October is still not over so the believers can still hope. I mean I hope I'm wrong but I don't believe BTC will be 16k this month.

Are you planning to have more cash-in options here in the Philippines? Apart from bank transfer and credit card purchase (4% fee) you can only purchase from Tambunting branches which are very far and few from each other. [Coins.ph]( easily beats you because of the plenty of options. Their spread is horrible though. Yours however, is acceptable. Please make plans to adding more cash-in options.
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:03:04
You can do it! I hope everyone here will be a member someday
@_date: 2019-06-13 02:04:31
7/11 was my go to cash-in option but the rates are dependent on how much I cash in. I go to payment centers right now (specially Palawan Express) because of the fixed rate ($.77) per transaction up to $962. If you can make the same arrangement with Palawan Express, I would gladly jump ship since your spread are much better.
 It does not have to have plenty of cash in options. Just a few reliable (and cheaper) ones and I'll be sold.

Congrats man! As someone who has an insignificant amount of btc, I would never bet mine but I'm glad yours turned alright!
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:37:07
I would understand even if their spread is a little high. That's the cost of adoption. As long as it has a physical reminder that cryptos are here to stay, I would buy from them. When the time comes that crypto is fully adopted, there would be no need for physical stores.
@_date: 2019-02-21 03:19:14
So price is the main reason. Thanks!

Him and that fake doctor guy. All of his tweets lately are full of hate

Are you willing to bet your dick on that?
@_date: 2019-02-21 06:30:48
Of course not but they are not the same in principle. In this case, there will only be 21M BTC. Granted, some of them are now forever lost (some estimate it at 4M). Hence, the 21million club.
@_date: 2019-02-20 10:56:27
Maybe. Maybe not :)

I love your username! BCH is the real Bitcoin    /s
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:39:29
Tell them you have some (to spark their interest) but don't tell them how much exactly do you have. Also, tell your most trusted person (spouse, parent/s, sibling/s) how to recover your crypto incase something unfortunate happens to you. Or you could not tell them so you will be a forever hodler and help the price moon
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:02:31
I did not mean it that way. I'm more bullish on alts since it multiplies my money faster compared to BTC. I have some alt bags but my confidence is in BTC since almost all alts prices depend on BTC.
I buy alts and after it multiplies my money, I sell some of it for BTC. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:50:12
Thanks for the 10sats! It will be valuable many years from now :)
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:04:23
Between Ledger and Trezor, I might go with Trezor since it is open sourced but I'm perplexed why Ledger is more popular. Maybe because of the interface?

Still on the exchange though. I'm looking for a local reseller for cold wallets.

I saw a post a few months ago who just joined the 21 million club. I wished that I could join that club one day. Now I'm in! Your turn will surely come.
@_date: 2019-02-20 05:55:59
All I could give you is silver man. I would give you BTG but I already sold it for BTC 
@_date: 2019-02-20 08:32:41
It's a risk I'm willing to take. There are promising alts out there. I just dont buy any alt and hope it will moon. Also, there are upcoming ICOs that are hyped. Most likely it will earn me more BTC. 
Last ICO I joined was BTT. It was x9 during it's peak. I sold at x7.
@_date: 2019-02-22 01:29:41
I'm on the Eastern side :)
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:49:28
How I wish I am member of that club. I read about BTC in college and while I was interested in the potential "money of the future" (as it was described) I had more urgent needs. Too bad.
@_date: 2019-02-20 04:28:44
Thank you for the suggestion. I've always been planning to buy a cold wallet but I never had a reason to. I now have reason so buy one. I hope you guys will soon join the club!
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:16:36
I'm ready for that time. Imagine, owning a .21BTC to be such a huge accomplishment. Great times are ahead of us!
@_date: 2019-04-30 05:55:48
250K might still be a long way. I'm bullish on crypto but I still hold 30% of my money to fiat. You'll need it in bear markets.

True story.

I maybe out of the loop but what will happen on the 21st?
@_date: 2019-01-08 06:48:00
But that would mean prices would tank right? Crypto in general tanked last year during the CNN.
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:21:18
I can relate. My parents asked me what a bitcoin and mining is. After a brief explanation, I was asked if it was a pyramid scheme. Answered no. Next question was if it is legal. They just could not grasp the idea that money can come from the GPUs I bought.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:52:59
Dumb question. If I run a node, is there some sort of compensation for it?

Re-decentralize? Tron, is that you?

Now that you phrase it that way, that really is plausible. I believe the government we are still safe for now but in the near future if some major terrorist activity will happen, the governments will find some excuse to try this.

Not this is what I call fighting the system. They (or at least Mr. Sherman) is threatened by cryptocurrencies that they are making steps to prevent it from spreading. I like what he says from 00:58 onwards.

Is that really a thing? I never heard about that until now. I was referring to OP being hacked physically since he has touched his phone. The malware/keylogger was physically implanted to his body and via his fingers, the malware transferred to his air gapped PC hence the /s at the bottom.
That was an interesting read by the way. Thanks for bringing that up!
