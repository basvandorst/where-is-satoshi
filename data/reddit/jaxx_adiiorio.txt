"Found to be insecure" - Source? or just spreading something you heard? 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:37:33
Thanks for the response. Just to make sure I understand then, the issue is that the transfer utility was able to access the seed and restore the wallet on a different phone? Any chance you might have a link to the thread?

You have a choice between 3 different speeds / costs in Jaxx. The recommendation results from your selection. Choose the minimal fee (much lower cost) if you don't want to have the transaction confirm in the next few blocks.

Hey there. Thanks for trying Jaxx. You can backup in the menu -&gt; tools -&gt; display backup phrase. Just write it down and keep it somewhere safe.

We don't operate Shapeshift or Coincap. We do have the shapeshift integration inside of Jaxx though.

What is it in particular you like about Exodus? I really dig the  portfolio screen, we're working on something similar in Jaxx. Yes, we do support more coins and we're available on 9 platforms. That being said, Exodus is a great option and very well designed.

Always nice to here positive comments about customer support experiences. What was the issue? If SS was able to resolve it was the problem on their end or on ours? (Jaxx)
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:18:40
Hey there. That means it hasn't confirmed as of yet. Disregard the confirmed in block heading and keep your eye on the Confirmations heading.

Please submit a support request at Jaxx.io. That's the best way to get assistance.

Hey there. New version v1.2 rolling out this week is much better at displaying accurate tx details and much faster overall. Android is already out, all other platforms rolling out over the next few days.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:43:15
Is there something you think we should do to make Jaxx "simpler"?
@_date: 2017-03-18 02:43:32
Sorry you've had troubles with Jaxx. We have a major release v1.2 that started rolling out this week that includes an overhauled infrastructure that's faster, smoother and provides more accuracy. Currently the android and chrome extension versions have launched, desktop versions and iOS slated for next week. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:06:19
Try our new v1.2 update, released this week &amp; available on Android Mobile / Tablet &amp; Chrome extension so far, other platforms rolling out in the next few days. You'll find it faster, lighter, and more efficient. Previous lagging was only apparent with older devices and mostly for people using Jaxx for mining payouts, which we strongly advise against using Jaxx for such purposes.

We've had some requests and do plan on improving it in the future. For now, if you're concerned with the someone getting access to your wallet we recommend ensuring you're taking advantage of your devices security features (ie. phone / pc lock, fingerprint, etc.) as your entire contents can be secured this way.

Jaxx does lag on some devices but new rebuild launching next week will improve performance considerably. Dealing with so many blockchain is an ongoing challenge but we confident the rebuild will tackle any performance issues.

Hey there. Anthony from Jaxx here. Please feel free to message me if you have any questions about are services.
@_date: 2016-10-25 19:24:52
We use an integration in "Slack" that's alerts us of mentions so that we can respond quickly.

To us our code is "open" as in you can see and audit the code but open source can mean different things to different people. We own our code and it is not meant to be compiled by anyone but us.
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:42:46
Please note that Jaxx IS NOT open source. If you’ve got the chops, the Jaxx codebase is auditable on our website and you can also directly inspect the code on some (not iOS) of the platforms that we support. It’s our position that malicious clones of well-known, open source, easily packaged wallets cause a great deal of harm to the community as they make their way onto app stores and across the internet stealing people’s money. We add friction points that make it difficult for our code to be copied all the while still allowing code inspection in multiple ways. If Jaxx not being open source is a concern for you, we urge you not to use our product and find an alternative.
@_date: 2017-07-27 02:25:54
Nope. FUD.

Hi there. Anthony from Jaxx here. Please DM me your support ticket number and I'll personally look into it. I'm sure we'll sort this out.
