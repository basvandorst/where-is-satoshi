That would explain why nobody uses it for payments in the US. What about other places in the world where taxation works differently?

Have you tried Kraken? Same fees as Bitstamp and SEPA transfers.

You do realize that this scarcity is after all artificial. If 51% of miners decided to support a fork that increased the supply, the cap could easily be increased.
Of course, it is highly unlikely that this would ever happen because it would decrease the value of Bitcoin, but there is a possibility. That's why I would definitely **not** call Bitcoin the most scarce good in the universe. There are no physical laws that manifest its scarcity.

The TV had an immediate and obvious use case for everyone. With cryptos the use case for the average person isn't there yet. 
It's similar to the Internet. In the end of the 90s people started seeing the potential of the internet, but there wasn't any real adoption yet.

If I understood you correctly, your problem is that half of your Bitcoin is now in an app called Blockstream Green and you can't access that because they didn't verify you?
Contact Blockstream Green. Very likely you're not screwed. Generally start using a wallet that doesn't require verification. Ideally a hardware wallet like the Ledger Nano S.
Otherwise check here: [ I'd recommend Mycelium or Samourai for increased privacy.

Some of my favorites (remember Bitcoin had fallen to $250 back then):
"No need to worry. Just more weak hands. Buy when there's blood in the streets. Fundamentals are very strong. There's a psychological buy wall at ~~$800~~ ~~$600~~ ~~$500~~ ~~$400~~ ~~$350~~ ~~$300~~ ~~$290~~ ~~$280~~ ~~$270~~ ~~$260~~ ~~$250~~ ~~$240~~ $230 that we're not likely to breach."
This one got downvoted a lot:
"Any price bellow 10,000 USD is really cheap, so I buy, does not matter if it is 10 USD or 999 USD."

Kraken &gt; Bitstamp
Deposits happen much faster at Kraken, they're cheaper and they also have Monero.

I've had same day deposits. Otherwise the next day on Kraken.

Sorry to hear that. Must fuckin suck.
Did you have 2FA activated? (I think nowadays they won't let you have an account without it)  
Did they gain access to your email address? 
You should really try to find out how they did because it could mean that your computer or email address is compromised and you might get hacked in the future again.

Did you read the IMF's article? They're suggesting starting a dual-currency that would have a different conversion rate for cash vs. account deposits. Saving cash instead of e-money wouldn't help you.
@_date: 2019-02-11 15:34:45
I believe adoption only happens when there's a significant advantage that exists even at a bad UX. 
For Bitcoin there is for example this one: it won't cost me to store Bitcoin. Besides inflation it would actually cost to store money at the bank. It would actually even cost you to store cash in your mattress with the IMF's suggestion:






I can't believe forcing consumers to spend money at all costs, to push the economy can be healthy long term.

Others have paid a lot more money to learn what you've hopefully learnt. Trust nobody on the Internet. Use well-known exchanges in the future and move the money off the exchange ASAP.

Yes, I thought that was very interesting too.

That site is awesome. You should put some more text on this, so Google picks it up.

A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.

If minimum monthly wage is between $6-9, how do you deal with Bitcoin's current transaction fee of 10 cents? 
As a comparison, imagine having a minimum wage of $2000 and paying $30 for EVERY transaction you make.
@_date: 2019-01-31 07:51:44
That even 5 or 2 cents are too much, when your average monthly salary is $6. That equals to paying $15 or $6 for every transaction you make. 
The narrative is over a year old, because once there were a lot of transactions in December 2017, you could pay $20 (like I did) and your transaction still wouldn't be included in the next block.
@_date: 2019-01-28 14:40:23
It actually just increased to 20 cents.

You're from a German speaking country, right?
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:07:17
You can get lucky, but if you want your transaction to be guaranteed within the next block - which you probably want when purchasing some food in a market in Venezuela - you need to pay around 20 cents currently. You can check the several sites that calculate it based on the mempool.

If the "elite" has the majority of Bitcoin, why would they want to inflate supply? It will decrease their holdings value.

I hope all of you have only small amounts at the exchanges. Otherwise this could exactly create what it's supposed to prevent: a run on the banks.

You have a signed contract? Go to [ and ask for advice. There might be some very cheap ways to get your money. Definitely worth a shot and you can often get your money without a lawsuit. 
I hope you learnt these rules:
1) Always get paid for your work, don't accept "If this becomes huge, you get 10%" deals. 
2) Always ask for continuous payment or some deposit.  
What kind of developer are you?
