I want to buy low, but honestly my little post on isn't going to affect millions of people with bitcoins. Its just a friendly advice.

Or maybe you are trying to keep bitcoins from going down so that your coins are worth more ?
Check out the graphs, my post won't change anything, it is going down.

I don't, I monitored it, as soon as it went back up (880$), I bought more bitcoins and now I'm making money again, and I'll get my bitcoins. I won't get screwed unless bitcoins crash before friday (when I officially get my bitcoins after transfert is done).
