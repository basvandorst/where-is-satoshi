The good thing is that Bitcoin is quite a lot of things. You can call it this or that, but the fact is - not many people understand how credit and debt works, or many other things. Sometimes, it’s just easier to say that it’s like PayPal, only cheaper and faster. The quicker the word about Bitcoin’s plus points spreads, the better.

The bear market of 2018 did not stop the steady progress in the technical prowess, adoption, and awareness of crypto and blockchain. The crypto winter, however, weeded out the superficial blockchain projects that didn’t offer utility, resulting in relatively healthier crypto markets. More awareness in mass media increased the exposure of cryptocurrency to many institutional investors. Not just that, the deflationary nature of Bitcoin is in direct contrast to the fundamentally inflationary nature of fiat money. This is generating more demand for Bitcoin.

These graphs are on different time-frames and some of them are outdated. However, the apparent intention of OP to show how fiat money is inflationary in nature is in support of promoting Bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin is deflationary by default and that gives the control back to people instead of central banks that can print more fiat money at will without using appropriate inflation-restricting practices.

The current version for Lightning Network required users to stay online to be certain that counterparty is not attempting to steal the assets involved in the transaction. To solve this user experience problem, the next Lightning Network version will include these anti-fraud Watchtowers whose key job will be monitoring the network for malicious broadcast attempts. This includes attempts to broadcast an old state to steal funds from counterparties. If caught by the Watchtower, malicious actors will be punished. This update takes the burden of monitoring from users and enhance overall security of transactions.

Many institutional investors changed their views about the value of crypto in the past year and some of them started entering into crypto markets, bringing substantial demand for Bitcoin with themselves. In addition to all this, we are close to the next halvening of block reward in 2020, which will further constrain the supply of Bitcoin. All of this resulted in the steady rise of Bitcoin’s price in early 2019 and now we’re witnessing the FOMO effect.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:13:22
In wildly bullish markets like the one we’re witnessing for Bitcoin this month, investors sitting on the sidelines almost always get affected by the fear of missing out (FOMO). This gif is funnily accurate representation of the order-book dynamics of Bitcoin markets with a high buy volume. 
Miners who are selling their mined Bitcoin this week are locking big profits. When there is FOMO in the markets, it’s always recommended to exercise caution with your buying activity.

While many merchants do not yet accept Bitcoin, it’s not unreasonable to think that they may in the future when it becomes more user friendly and intuitive. Comparing Bitcoin to gold in day to day transactions is a little unfair. If anything, the upside is that Bitcoin can function both as a store of value and as a medium of exchange, unlike gold, which does not function well as a medium of exchange.

The Lightning Torch initiative has seen the crypto community throw its weight behind the Lighting Network protocol. The torch has been passed across more than 137 countries and a total of 3.7 million Satoshis being sent. The ideology behind Bitcoin was to enable global, cross border payment transfers which the torch initiative has achieved. The Lightning torch has so far been passed to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey, LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman, TRON founder Justin Sun, finance giant Fidelity to name a few. But interestingly, people across countries who do not have peaceful relations between them have also been sending 10,000 Satoshis to each other as part of the torch initiative. Satoshi's vision of cross border payment is also bringing people closer.

On March 12, 2019, the ECB tweeted that it could create as much money as it wanted, to buy assets. Bitcoin cannot be created out of thin air. There is a fixed supply of 21 million Bitcoin which miners will mine, unlike the ECB which can print as many Euros it needs.

There is a common saying in crypto that tokens in the wallet belong to the person who has the keys to that wallet. Centralised digital currency exchanges have a disadvantage that they could lose user assets. It is always advisable to not use exchange wallets for storing your digital tokens.

You should begin by delving into the detail of Bitcoin and understanding its need, development and use cases. The Bitcoin whitepaper is the best reference material to begin learning. If you are comfortable with programming languages, you should study different BIPs and actively look for new proposals. Mining Bitcoin, running a full node, hosting a Lightning Network node, and being involved in the development of Bitcoin are some ways to support the digital currency.

It is great to see Lightning Network grow and more users setting up payment nodes. There has also been a 30 percent increase in the capacity of LN in February 2019. Lightning Network was greeted by a fair amount of scepticism when it launched. Hence its success is even sweeter now. The growth of LN is dependent on use cases. Tipping has shown to be a great development to take LN to the masses. LN Pizza also makes it possible for you to complete payment for your pizza using Bitcoin.

There is no other digital currency that even comes close to Bitcoin. It has the highest market capitalisation, highest acceptability among masses and the strength of community support.

It must be noted that Bitcoin never had a marketing campaign, never ran an ICO and is still the number one.

Storing your Bitcoin on a hardware wallet is the recommended and safest option. You could go for either Ledger or Trezor. Remember to buy it from an official seller only and never use a resold hardware wallet. Backup the seed words and keep them with you. But if you want to use your Bitcoin for paying for coffee or other daily activities then you should use a paper wallet as it gives you the option of liquidity. These wallets are also called online wallets and are less secure when compared to a hardware wallet.

There is a need to look at Bitcoin from different perspectives other than investment only. The world's oldest digital currency still has the highest market share.

They might have shorter block intervals and faster processing times, but they do not have the community support which Bitcoin enjoys.

 The Lighting Network is a Layer 2 payment transfer protocol being developed by Lightning Labs. Many payments sent over the Bitcoin blockchain are micro payments which slow the network. The idea of Lightning Network is to settle these payments off chain by using payment nodes over a channel. Only the balance amount of each node after a channel is closed will be updated on the Bitcoin blockchain. This frees the network for bigger transactions and also reduces processing fees for all Bitcoin users. Users could run their own LN nodes to send and receive Bitcoin. 
It is cheaper to complete BTC transactions over LN than on the Bitcoin mainchain, which will help in taking crypto to the masses. Companies or merchants who accept Bitcoin could also run an LN node for receiving payment from customers. Currently, merchants use payment settlement protocols provided by Visa, Mastercard and others which is expensive when compared to running an LN node. 
The developer documentation available at Lightning Network's website  
[ is a great place to begin learning about the network. Or you can check the [megathread](
There are several Android wallets which are compatible for sending payments using the Lightning Network. Some of them are open source which ensures that they receive constant updates. The best wallets compatible with Android devices are Eclair, Zap, Spark and Fulmo.

This launch will bring in a new standard for enabling institutional investors to access crypto markets and increase trading volume and liquidity for crypto markets as a whole.

Wasabi Wallet is an open source wallet which basically helps to mix your coins using trust-less approach without relying on any third party. For better obscurity, it works via Tor by default.

Decentralized exchanges including BISQ, have been suffering from low trading volumes and market liquidity. P2P exchanges offer high resistance to transaction censorship, are cheap to use, private, and secure. However, at the end of the day, BISQ is a marketplace and that means it faces the chicken-and-egg problem every new marketplace does, until it can reach the critical mass of sellers and buyers. P2P exchanges are not at all in demand with, for example, professional traders, who need fast transactions to make timely deals. In their current state, these exchanges are mainly useful to people interested in the specific advantages they offer - the increased resilience, privacy, security, and freedom of payments.

As and when they understand the pitfalls, dangers, and misuse potential of the centralized financial system we currently have, they are more likely to explore and adopt a decentralized alternative as Bitcoin.

However, once transactions are confirmed and the network hash rate continues to increase the possibility of a double spend becomes more and more likely. As the number of transactions increase the difficulty of verifying each transaction further drops, making the overall security of the network that much greater at this time. This is why double spending of BTC from a mined transaction will only ever be possible if the Coinbase transaction has an address that includes the full hash of the original transaction.

In the case of a short position going in the wrong direction, liquidation usually means being forced to cover the position.  When the fresh capital call is not met by the trader, BitMex's liquidation engine automatically liquidates the short position, i.e. buys the shorted asset. Exchanges usually require the short seller to hold collateral to back his/her borrowing and cover the associated risk. When that collateral is no longer is sufficient because of fresh price action, the exchange either force-liquidates the short position or demands more collateral to back the increased risk. This is known as a squeeze or a short squeeze.  At a short-squeeze, the price of the asset usually undergoes a sharp upside jump due to significant amount of buying in a short time.

This is Byzantine Generals Problem of double spending. It is applicable to every distributed network. In fact, in the Bitcoin network, it is even more complex as there is no true ‘General’ or server. All participants or nodes (‘Lieutenant’) are exactly of equal hierarchy.
All participating nodes have to agree upon every message that is transmitted between the nodes. If a group of nodes is corrupt or the message that they transmit is corrupt then still the network as a whole should not be affected by it and should resist this ‘Attack’. In short, the network in its entirety has to agree upon every message transmitted in the network. This agreement is called consensus. The double spend problem is solved by Bitcoin to attain true digital scarcity.

An ETF holds assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds and generally operates with an arbitrage mechanism designed to keep it trading close to its net asset value. ETFs offer both tax efficiency as well as lower transaction and management costs. More than US$2 trillion were invested in ETFs in the United States between when they were introduced in 1993 and 2015. By the end of 2015, ETFs offered 1,800 different products, covering almost every conceivable market sector, niche, and trading strategy. Bitcoin ETFs as a security, it would meet a variety of legal and market requirements to be traded, and hence would allow investors that are unable or uncomfortable with direct ownership of Bitcoin to participate.

Department officials were quick to note that was no expectation that the audit would be clean, given the size and scope of the project. The overarching issues revolves around inventory management challenges and IT security system architecture. Blockchain is well-suited to solve these very issues and bring immutability, transparency, and decentralization in DoD's budgeting, inventory management and procurement operation processes.

Bitcoin's inventor Satoshi Nakamoto set a monetary policy based on artificial scarcity at Bitcoin's inception that there would only ever be 21 million Bitcoins in total. The Bitcoin protocol specifies that the reward for adding a block will be halved every 210,000 blocks (approximately every four years). It means less new supply, which limits inflation,  but existing circulating BTC supply will not change. The next date of halvening is in May 2020.

The interviews in this video demonstrates the lack of awareness about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies among the general population, even the educated young segments.

The next Bitcoin block reward halving will occur in roughly 57,000 blocks, putting in somewhere in May 2020. Based on the last two halvings, many expect Bitcoin to see major price gains after the supply falls, but there’s no guarantee that the pattern will hold. Halving of block rewards and a maximum possible supply of 21 million BTC gives the cryptocurrency an anti-inflationary property. When the next halving event takes place, it will give Bitcoin an inflation rate of around 1.8 percent per year, down from its current 3.8 percent.

Nations with failed fiat currencies such as Venezuela will likely be among the first places where Bitcoin achieves mass adoption. However, that fact that even if the bolivar is almost worthless and still less than 1% of venezuelans are using Bitcoin on a daily basis as per the number of on-chain transactions or people using Lightning Network, gives us a reality test on how suitable current version of Bitcoin is, to be used as an independent alternative currency.
