I lost 1/3 of my btc investing in cloud mining a couple of years ago. Watched my shares drop steadily over the course of a few months. It'll go back up, I said. Let's just say it was a costly lesson to learn. 
Everyone wants your btc. YOUR btc. They'll promise great things in return. Once you send them away, you have no guarantee, no security, no insurance, and no accountability from those who now own your btc. I'm not here to argue, and you're welcome to defend these organizations - but please don't say no one warned you.
Don't touch your stash.

I told myself the same thing - cognitive mining, asicminer, it doesn't matter. Everyone wants your coins, you'll never get a return on that investment. Btc value will rise (as an investment) more quickly than any company's capital. Don't listen to me if you don't want to. I'm not trying to mess you up.

Once again, low-information, economically ~~uneducated (sorry, presumptuous of me)~~ inexperienced equalist chimes in on how shitty early adopters are. Shame on them for investing in crypto before the author. Otherwise, the author has nice flow, grammar, and a natural talent for writing in this format.
Edit, excerpt:


@_date: 2017-05-29 17:54:06
Yeah - I've had a weak miner running for a few years now. I don't even think about it anymore. I don't understand the talk about miners wanting get high fees, when our income is based on block rewards. However, I'm not a fan of someone with enough centralized hash power to exploit the network. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:57:16
That's my plan. I was considering just leaving the bcc on the paper wallet, until better wallet options emerge. If everyone is selling it down, I won't get much for them anyway. I do believe others will still buy the price back up, eventually (bcc). 
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:33:53
I would like to know as well. I made a temporary paper wally for the split, then I plan to sweep the btc back to my normal storage, then hold the paper wallet until there is a convenient wallet to sweep the bcc to. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 14:43:45
If I moved my btc to a temporary paper wallet, how long do I have to decide what I will do? Is there any sense of urgency, or could I just keep that wallet until I decide to split it?  
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:58:19
Thanks! I figured the password was only for the device. If it's actually part of the seed (or would be necessary on another device), that would be awesome. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:20:17
If I made a randomly generated brain wallet, can I add some words of my own to make it longer and more secure?
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:19:52
Life is like an aeroplane, 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:41:44
What if you take the calculated 12 words, then added a few of your own in the mix. Maybe a misspelled word or two. More secure or less secure?
Edit: Someone told me it would be less secure, but that made no sense to me. 
 
@_date: 2017-06-11 14:24:56
So it would would be less entropy even if it were longer? What if I used the rng words + added a few misspelled words? The program would still have to guess the randomly generated words either way. Thanks for helping. This is confusing

I've got DMS.SELLING as well. I like the consistent daily payouts for DMS.MINING, but I hadn't noticed the difference for DMS.SELLING. With the volume I'm holding (of DMS.MINING), I see it purely as a source of income. I don't ever expect to be able to sell them in short time period without running the price down. I'll have to look into this and pick up some more DMS.SELLING.

I don't like this article. One more chum gets in too late and wants to change the protocol so he can widen the distribution of mining power again. If everyone were still cpu or gpu mining, he'd have the same problem. You'd have a lesser yield than litecoin's is at the present, which I won't even mine now due to cost and decreasing marginal utility. 
@_date: 2013-09-20 11:03:44
This is right on. I'll consider buying hash power if/when the difficulty curve ever goes linear, or if the gear actually ships when it's ordered.

@_date: 2013-04-18 18:49:22
Excellent post. All great points. Folks that are hardcore into litecoin either don't have the funds for a substantial amount of btc, or they don't have enough currency in any form to afford a mining unit. Ltc is the po' boy's btc game, but it's just a game. You don't want to have to walk into a store and ask if they take, ltc? Ok how bout ppc? No? How about dvc? OK OK How about BTC? Btc doesn't need the competition, but if someone wants to keep their SHA256 miner off the BTC network, hoping for a payoff on some other crypto, that's fine by me.

Sounds novel, but as we've seen before, anyone will sell out out for the right price. It starts out as ad sales, because if it takes off, companies will be throwing money at you for ad real estate. You'll find inherent flaws, and you'll want to fix them, but if a buyer wants to pay you a million for your service, as is, which you can recreate externally as an even better service, everyone involved risks losing privacy at the discretion of the new managers. But it would be cool. You just might have to make some kind of income model. Not a subscription, but a one time fee or something.

I also gave them a cash option to refund me via PayPal transfer. They haven't written back yet to that option. If they insist, again, on the most inconvenient, archaic method of balance transfer (wire), I'll suspect it's a tactic to quell the majority of refund requests from its customers by that one simple, canned reply.
Thanks for responding with your insight. I would counter by saying it's like buying something with the euro, and being offered a refund in usd. I know it's not that simple, and I'd be willing to compromise on the value difference in Bitcoin. But even if I do that, they make 2 btc for the inconvenience. I'm sure they keep a running btc balance anyway, and the price hasn't fluctuated that much since I bought. 
@_date: 2013-07-12 18:52:54
My results are better proof than anything else, in my post. If I had done your research for you, I'd have to ask you to trust me. I'd prefer to post results, and leave trust out of it. Whether or not the price goes up, the dividends from this security are among the best I've held per btc invested.
THIS is my community, not the stocks sub. I chose my audience. I had no time/energy at the time of posting go in depth, and if I had, the post may have belonged elsewhere. I also don't have all day to respond in multi-paragraph form to liberal-esque, contrary individuals who will labor over syntax.

I've already responded to your criticism. I get your point. Conventionally, a submission title needs to be as short as possible, while still providing a hook.

Either way, I don't have to worry about having my gold confiscated when I retire in Costa Rica. Thanks for the advice, because I'm SO not an expert with finances. I'll make sure to check laws when I'm ready to take disbursements.
@_date: 2013-05-31 13:35:22
I agree. It's gonna be a problem. We have a growing market, as well as lots of investors in ASIC tech. Sat/Nak foresaw this as well. If someone doesn't like it, they can just make a new alt coin and market it. If bitcoin can be changed in this way, it will be as if had been centralized and socialized all at once.

This security is trending down, despite its dividend performance. As a worst case scenario, I would assume the downtrend would continue. My only guesses as to why it's not more costly would be:
1. Lack of notice in the shadow of asicminer
2. People are more interested in daytrading, holding popular securities, or buying/selling.
My original investment into crypto has been withdrawn, so it's all just awesome fun for me now. I'm prepared to lose, and thus more willing to risk.

@_date: 2013-07-12 14:59:27
I raised dividends diversity awareness to potential newcomers who are bright enough not to buy into asicminer at the current price. This security has earned me an income that will complement my mining situation. This was purely meant to be above a simple "stock tip," as I am no longer a daytrader. I want everyone to be able to take advantage of this income at a lower cost than I did. I'm down on it, but I've made up for that difference quickly through dividends.
@_date: 2013-05-19 13:20:14
1.  I'll do my best to not to disrespect this as a typical hard-left-type rally, but I consider the future of Bitcoin lucky to have frontmen who are actually experts in its implementation. We have established our much needed PR. Yes, I am conservative, and I am educated. Focal experience outweighs any lowly-informed mass when things need to get done.
