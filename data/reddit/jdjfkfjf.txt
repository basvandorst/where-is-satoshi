The Mexican drug lord does not sell the drugs himself either.
He was not "just doing a tech job", he was running a huge international drug and illegal items business.
If he had "just done a tech job", he wouldn't have received life in prison but worked at Google or something. He certainly knew what he was getting into.
He wouldn't have made millions of $$$ in 2 years though "working just a tech job".
Big money but big risk and he just f**ked up and got caught.

This kid is no hero, he ran a $183 million drug, fake documents, etc business.
Last time I visited his website before it got busted they were selling cyanide and murder-for-hire there. That's serious stuff, not just a few grams of dope.
Nobody would care if the site was run by a brown Mexican or something, everyone would agree with a life sentence in that case. Lol

He was convicted on several counts, including "continuing criminal enterprise". All of the convictions carry hefty sentences.
Combined, life in prison seems fair to me.

I followed the trial a bit, Ulbricht indeed confirmed paying $150000 to have a guy killed, although the guy he paid was FBI. Ulbrichts lawyer said to court it was some kind of "role play" (LOL).
The other guys he tried to kill he paid $500000 to have people killed in Canada. Google "Ulbricht Hells Angels Vancouver".
It is believed he was scammed in this case though, since no murder has taken place.
