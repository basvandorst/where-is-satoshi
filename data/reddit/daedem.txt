Oh I actually don't give a fuck about it. I just read this because I'm bored. I only commented because you do yourself no favours. 
Rabidly attacking Andreas and crying "not my job to educate you" is a horrible way to get your point across. My comment was a rhetorical question meant to make you reconsider your approach.
Also for someone on the outside the OP really doesn't prove your point so just pointing back to it does nothing.

Why should anyone bother to care about your point of view if you refuse to explain yourself?

Oh I never said anything about the ease of executing alternatives. I completely agree with you. But you have to agree that there are flaws in our public voting system.
@_date: 2014-09-30 03:08:00
No offense but this reads like a shill. That might just be my skepticism though.

What's wrong with this idea? It makes perfect sense. Being 18 doesn't magically make you capable. 
Hell one could argue that such a lax requirement for voting leads to a large number of issues.

God will this pathetic gender politics bullshit fuck off? I don't see how a vagina or penis makes you better equipped to contributing to bitcoin.

You've missed the point so badly, you've just lost the MH370. He's saying someone who is the president cannot be a shill, because he's not hiding the fact that he's a president.

The problem is that all the things you mentioned are dollars. A Bhat and a Bitcoin aren't the same. So it's not the best comparison.
@_date: 2015-05-21 12:05:53
Do you believe this, as you take tax-funded roads? Did you come to this idea during or after tax-funded public schools?
Examine your life, and where you use services funded by taxes and ask yourself "would any of this have been built if taxes were voluntary?"
And have you done everything in your power to reduce the use of tax-funded services and infrastructure? Or are you a hypocrite?
@_date: 2015-01-29 02:30:22
No but the $ still means the same thing: Dollar. The ฿ is either Bitcoin or Bhat. Those aren't the same thing. What would be the same, would be a Viet Bhat using the ฿ for example.

Why are there any factories in China if they can just be automated in the US? Probably due to the associated costs I imagine.

No of course not but at least you know he did say it, and it's not someone making shit up.

Don't trust what anyone says Trump said. Find a primary source. Video or audio recording would be best.
People on both sides of Trump (supporters and detractors) cherrypick shit and you can't believe any of them.

If the power and internet go down, the world has bigger issues than Bitcoin.

Unless every miner is working in concert, someone is gonna take the more reasonable transaction instead of demanding a ludicrous amount. Remember 1 in the hand is worth 2 in the bush.

Unlike fiat, Bitcoin can be entirely secured WITHOUT A BANK. Unlike fiat, Bitcoin can be transferred internationally WITHOUT THIRD PARTY ENTITIES.
The only reason people are losing Bitcoins is because they're acting like it's fiat and trusting third parties more than they should.
If you don't want to lose your coins, don't give them to someone else to hold on to. You don't need to do that to use them, so just don't.

And that's the real problem with any platform isn't it. If you build it, will they really come?
If it was accessed via web browser/mobile I would. 
Although I think the best plan of action to attract users is to convince users interested in the idea and surrounding ideas (anonymity, decentralization, unfettered free speech) to form small communities (and being decentralized it's not like it'll cost people).

Ignorant criticisms are easier to prove wrong. Intelligent criticism takes a bit more work.

I was literally thinking this exact same thing last night. If I could automatically pay 1 to 5 cents to read an article I would. Especially if it meant no ads, no native advertising and no analytics being sold to advertisers.
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:48:07
Yes and right now there is no way to only play a really small amount for said words. That is what the micro transactions are for. Click a button and pay a few cents to read it. No ads, no data collection: just money.

How does anyone try to point to  as a reason for 1 thing in particular being bad. At this point our entire life is dependent on internet access. Some people are silly.

Or he could sell the data to the US in return for getting him off his back now, or in the future (I can't remember if the US govt. still wants him).

How can you vote brigade unintentionally? Would that just not represent the views and interests of new users to a subreddit?

Depends on the cause of the car crash. If it was due to drink driving, the points are equal because not denouncing drunk driving could, by your logic, lead to drunk drivers killing people.

No I'm pretty sure it was SA.
