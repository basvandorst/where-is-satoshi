This whole hate meme is getting old.  BFL delivers.  Their miners work just fine.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:48:21
I think you will probably want to change the name of your software.  EasyMiner is already one of the better known miners out there.

What if the promised ship date was fuzzy to begin with at the time of sale and accepting that was a condition of the sale?  I think we all bought miners knowing the development time was part of the risk we accepted.  Being sophisticated consumers in the eyes of the law has a part to play here.  This will be fun to watch either way, but I suspect this will end up going nowhere.

I'm pretty sure after their delay we were all forced to make a decision to stay in the order queue or get a forced refund.  You couldn't get a refund after that and a lot of people wanted to because the difficulty went up, but BFL did what they promised.  There's a lot of sour sentiment because people calculated that if they had received their miner on the original schedule and nobody else received theirs, then they would be rich.  That's what the BFL scam hype is all about, nothing more.  It's the scape goat for everyone that missed out on bitcoin gold fever profits.

You do realize that the central accusation is that they sat on customer hardware for months while mining but nobody has ever given any proof that this is the case.  Meanwhile you have former employees who've confirmed they didn't do anything more than a shorter than appropriate burn test.  They were late with development, that's for sure but all the other accusations are just emotional mutterings.  It was Avalon who's machines arrived to customers with dust and mining IP's in their configuration.  Not BFL.  Hate on, but hate accurately.

I like how it emphasizes how it's useful to new users without getting too wonky.  The old one talked about mining too much and didn't show that you can buy just about anything.  I suppose there weren't many things you could buy when the first one was made, but this brings the narrative up to modern times very well.  Great job.
@_date: 2014-04-22 15:37:52
That wasn't BFL, that was Avalon units with dust in them and recorded mining IP's.  Here's the article:

Don't buy into the hate meme.  BFL has delivered more hardware than any other vendor.  Their miners work as advertised and they're one of the few vendors selling shelf stock and not just pre-orders.
@_date: 2014-01-19 17:57:23
This is exciting.  Well done.

The ars technica article is by the author who has dedicated himself to snuff out bitcoin.  Cyrus Farivar.  His interest in BFL is to further his dislike for bitcoin.  It's a speculative piece based on selective information.  BFL engaged him in their forum and invited him down to get the real story first hand but he refused.
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:23:20
If his claim is that he wants his bitcoins back now that their value appreciated, I expect his default judgement will be overturned in appeal. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:12:21
That was awesome.

The Trezor guys are good people.  BFL people are as well.  The constant hating on any business model that doesn't involve overnight shipping is getting old.  If you don't want the bleeding edge, don't order it.  It's that simple.
@_date: 2014-04-22 18:31:37
Why do people hate bitcoin mining manufacturers so much?  Most of them make hardware with clear purchase terms that we all agree to and then we line up bitch about it.
I understand the emotions involved but we're all adults and it's amazing to me that these childish perspectives seem to get repeated again and again in spite of reality.   It's damaging to the reputation of bitcoin.  Grow up.
@_date: 2014-01-01 05:06:38
Exactly this.  From what I understand, BFL has delivered all the products under the terms of their sale agreement.  So what is the claim against them?
@_date: 2014-01-20 00:45:15
The bitcoin virus will soon reach epidemic success.

Maybe people should realize that pre-ordering mining hardware isn't the same as ordering a video card via overnight delivery.  Every manufacturer (Avalon, KNC, AsicMiner, BFL, Hashfast &amp; Cointerra) have experienced delays of some sort or another.  Some have handled it differently than others but mostly it's all the same thing.  We consumers have to be realistic and take some responsibility for our part in accepting the risks laid out as we ordered.

I got my gear a bit late, but they've been running solid ever since and I've made excellent profit.  I've got no complaints.
@_date: 2014-03-24 13:18:02
Here we go again..  let's bash the mining hardware makers because they make money.  This 6th grade logic is tiring.
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:04:15
The vertical progression of the imagery works well.  This is excellent work.

Larry is no dummy.  For him to give a nod to bitcoin ever so subtly like this is a pretty good indication that his ilk know the movement has legs.
@_date: 2014-01-01 03:01:45
The negativity on this subreddit is behavior you'd find in a Justin bBieber thread.  Yes...  I think a rational explanation would be useful.
@_date: 2014-01-01 05:45:53
BFL apparently delivered working miners under the terms they were sold.  That much is a matter of public record.  Yes, they were late, but the terms they were sold under allowed for it.  That's not theft or stealing.  
@_date: 2014-01-01 22:42:14
There are multiple posts from people who got their miners right away.  (although those posts seem to get down voted pretty quickly)   I'm guessing the response he got was a generic conservative one.
@_date: 2014-04-24 16:39:05
The article says prosecutors made these accusations which is clearly not true.  The filed case is an attempt to secure a class action suit by a private lawyer based on speculation.  No evidence is presented to back up the accusations.  
Let's see how many people down vote me for posting fact.

Free Market is a much better name for sure.  As a community, we've got an opportunity to make better decisions than promoting illicit themes.  I understand Amir &amp; his team are doing the right thing in spirit and they deserve a special thanks from us all, but if he could bend on the naming of it he would be doing us an even bigger favor.
@_date: 2014-01-01 02:48:15
Let me guess, you paid in bitcoin and now that bitcoin has gone up, you want to get your bitcoins back.  Huh?
@_date: 2014-05-19 19:56:55
It sure would be sweet justice for these guys.  I'd run to see that movie.

Andreas just become the favored voice of bitcoin.  Bravo.

Kansas city has a new car dealer accepting bitcoin.
Kansas city has Google fiber.
Kansas city has a bitcoin hardware manufacturer.
Kansas city has a major law firm accepting bitcoin.
What the hell is happening in Kansas?
