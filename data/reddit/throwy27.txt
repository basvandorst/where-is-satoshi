True... I'm a long way from making it happen, since I just started with BTC today anyway :/ My info hasn't even cleared yet.
Well, advertising it is, then! \^_^
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:19:55
Yes, I can hardly sit still :D I cannot wait to possibly offer products in exchange for BTC, I would love to help bring the currency more mainstream \^_^
I wrote in another thread that I might look into selling some of my arts for BTC :) We'll see how it all goes!
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:54:30
Exactly :D 
I acted as if it was *completely* normal to ask whether they take Bitcoin already :)
Get with the times, grocery store! :P
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:48:02
Ooh, what's this? :O
*Jumps into research*
I've seen these before but I never looked. Exciting! 
THANK YOU SO MUCH! \^_^

Just a tip: BitMit is shutting down in 4 weeks, might want to take them out of the links at the end :)
Great job!

If I were ever in the position of "not having to work", that would mean to me that I'd be able to do what I have always wanted.
Namely, paint and do arts and crafts that I would sell.
Financial independency means options, not boredom. :)
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:58:55
That sounds like an interesting experiment. If you do that, let us know how it goes! I'd be very interested in the outcome.
@_date: 2013-11-03 02:34:53
I know!! It's so amazing!! Never have I wished more to be able to look 10-15 years into the future :D
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:22:34
Etsy of Bitcoin! I like that :D
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:06:45
Okay, thanks for the heads up!
Poor thing, I think I sent it 5 or 6 of those command private messages, wondering if it went through :3 
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:15:02
I am so new to BTC... What are trusted exchanges?
@_date: 2013-07-15 13:54:16
Can you please elaborate on this a bit? :) Thank you!
@_date: 2013-11-10 04:41:34
287 again :3 Have a nice life, puppet :)
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:06:21
Thanks :3 And while I am beyond excited and just sitting here refreshing my account info, I know where the limits are :)
@_date: 2013-11-02 20:23:15
I don't have my own website :( Since this is such a new idea for me, I have yet to do such things. :) 
I can send you a couple of links in a private message, if you'd like to see them.
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:52:34
Oh wow thank you so much!! That is super awesome of you :3
I will pass it on to people I get into Bitcoin tomorrow \^_^ I have a list now :D
@_date: 2013-07-16 05:22:41
Wow thank you for the comprehensive answer! I will look more in-depth into it tomorrow! I signed up for a wallet at coinbase.com today, and I plan on selling some of my arts and art services only for bitcoins. 
I want to contribute to the spreading of bitcoin, and the acceptance of it in more everyday life!
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:34:48
There's near infinite possibilities and even more combinations of that to what I do. I really don't think this matters.
No, I have no password that even resembles those example words.
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:10:33
What if you combine made up words from different languages? I always do this for passwords, pass phrases, etc. They don't exist in books, or dictionaries. 
Would that work?
Edit: I speak 3 languages, so I guess it'd be a lot easier for me to remember such a pass phrase than for those who speak 1. 
Edit2: I mean words like "swalucious" for English or "schidtrachs" for German, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-03 07:14:08
Coinbase :) Been reading up a lot about different things, and it seemed like that would be the best choice for me.
I looked into local too, but that was very expensive, usually 20-30 dollars over online merchants. :(
@_date: 2013-11-03 05:49:37
Public address... Here? What for?
Ok, let's see :D (Hope I'm doing this right)
Not like I have anything on there yet, except for 2 cents worth from these fixtures sites.
EDIT: Not fixtures... Faucets :D
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:54:20
Well at that point it looked more like 0.00000000 :D
I just got some gift Bitcoins while I'm waiting for all my info to clear, and I also went through some faucet websites (I don't want to see another captcha for the next week LOL), so it doesn't say that anymore! \^_^
@_date: 2013-11-04 01:56:04
Giving "advice" without writing any reason as to why... Way to go :/
@_date: 2013-07-16 15:15:28
How do you convert this PrimeCoin to BitCoin? I'm delving into this a bit deeper today, sounds so interesting!
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:23:10
Sorry, I don't quite understand. I'm not very math-minded :)
So let's say I have 20 of my made up words, length of no less that 8 characters each in my pass phrase. 
What does this mean for me?
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:55:55
Thank you for the answer and the long write up!  Appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-11-09 08:18:47
Wow, cool story! Thanks for sharing!        
Have you ever gotten around to carrying a sign saying free $1 bitcoin if you listen and sign up for a wallet?      
(Excuse me if that comment wasn't yours, it's 2 am and I received it a few days ago :) )
Also, how very cool of you to give BTC away! Best on you, friend :)
@_date: 2013-11-03 15:31:53
Oh I'm sorry to hear you have such troubles :( It took me a long time to work up the courage to open a separate account and then send so much info about myself. It would have completely turned me off if similar would have happened to me as it did to you. :/
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:43:22
Couldn't have said it better myself :3
@_date: 2013-11-03 03:39:49
Yeah I can see what you mean :) But the sale is not adding to my livelihood (it's a new thing), so I thought I'll restrict it :)
But it makes sense what you say, yes.
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:54:10
Thank you for the write up! I'll read through this more times later when it's not 1 am, and my brain doesn't feel so tired :)
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:24:19
Where can you do day trading with bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:24:46
I am seriously considering selling my art creations exclusively for bitcoin. I know the currency is still in its infancy, but I feel like it'd contribute to the emergency of BTC. :) I want to make it happen!
@_date: 2013-11-03 06:37:20
Yep, it helps!
