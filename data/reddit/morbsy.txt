Buy $500 worth and sit on it for 2 years. don't panic when it drops, just watch it go back up. Its quite entertaining and nail biting at the same time. its gives me a bit of a rush because the result is truly unknown.

it will spike again, give it a week. Turn your phone off uninstall the app and check it out in a weeks time. 
I bought at $26000 AUD. Its all good fun though. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:14:30
There is another article I read that states it is a new investment from 2017.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:09:40
I thought the same thing. Im thinking seaford, woodcroft or aldinga. looks very familiar cant remember which one 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:31:00
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:44:54
Me too. Bought $1500 at $26300 AUD. sucks to be us. I told her relatives that they should do it too so im currently sitting on their cash as well. This'll be a fun Christmas dinner, to tell or not to tell? That is the question.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:32:30
What do you mean by this? Im using coinjar and they charge 1% each trade.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:37:05
I just came to say thanks.
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:11:51
I'm hoping for a slow and stable increase once we hit October. If history tells us anything this will be when it happens
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:41:41
But it's mainstream now so it's different right? 
@_date: 2019-06-03 21:46:57
It's a very good show yes, I'm not sure it deserves to be the highest rated though. I think because it's a true story with a lot of mystery behind it for some people it resonates so well.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:29:06
High value product, I will admire the size of your gonads upon the first successful sale. Everyday adoption starts with people like yourself.

@_date: 2019-06-02 12:46:00
Damn I need to get me some of that. If John says it's good, it must be.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:39:48
Another great painting. Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2019-06-02 20:58:42
That figure is dependant on the time frame you select. If you have 24 hrs selected it means the price of bitcoin has changed as per that percentage. You will get different percentages when you select different timeframes because of bitcoins "by the minute" volatility
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:12:36
Even if it does drop, keep adding to your imvestment slowly that way you can dollar cost average your total share.
@_date: 2019-06-03 08:05:03
Does that include transfer fees for cold storage every time you purchase?
@_date: 2019-06-04 07:17:30
I think you've had too much 420 chronicler
@_date: 2019-06-05 09:02:26
Wow man, relax.
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:15:26
Very cool, Kanye
@_date: 2019-04-03 07:49:37
Apparently you do brother man, apparently you do.
@_date: 2019-04-03 07:50:52
Yay it only has to increase 3x more so I break even!!!
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:59:57
Recommended cold storage devices these days? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:09:54
Trolling? Only invest what you can afford to lose. I look at the charts through out the day and just shrug my shoulders because at the end of the day its only leisure money, and watching my investment grow or decline is leisurely for me.

You would have received more upvotes for leaving the video in it's original state. You've spoon fed the idea of the video by editting it, there for removing any of the thought processing behind it.

Ledger is also open source
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:41:19
It's the fact your crossing into different countries that have different laws and taxes
@_date: 2019-05-09 07:55:43
Hey, thanks for the advice. My coins are on Coinjar, how do I send them to a ledger (once I buy one).
Thanks for your help.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:37:58
Wow that was epic man. Really got me pumped to drop another 5k by the end of that vid
@_date: 2019-05-16 22:05:20
It's amazing the effect a graph can have on someone's will to spend more money lol
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:38:52
I'm only half way there lolol
@_date: 2019-05-28 07:28:53
This should be stickied for beginners. Some minor corrections required.
@_date: 2019-05-16 11:21:16
Just looking at your website, and I feel your next painting needs to picture vegeta.
@_date: 2019-05-27 10:21:05
Can confirm. Rumour checks out.
@_date: 2019-05-15 03:57:15
But you just said you were giving her the money and then you would trade with it from her account. Now your trying to justify illegal activity after asking for advice. Hmm?
@_date: 2019-05-10 21:23:26
Thanks. It should arrive in a few days now so I'll check it out then.
@_date: 2019-05-30 10:44:56
Hey if it generates fomo sign me up!
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:43:44
Exactly. We all want stability and to be able to future plan.
@_date: 2019-05-23 22:38:44
Ledgers require a passphrase for each transaction
@_date: 2019-05-26 21:52:08
Interesting, that's what their website says
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:31:36
Thanks, there wasn't an issue when I traded from standard to Segwit so just wanted to make sure that it was all good the other way around also.
