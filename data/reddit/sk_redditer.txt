I am talking about 5000 years ago. Even as recently as decades ago, it wasn’t safe or secure to hoard gold. And yet gold sustained its value. Even today, there is no fool proof security for gold, you can lose it as easily as anything if your house is robbed.
They won’t be better of storing gold as bitcoin ecosystem will keep improving security. Now dont say to wait and see until that happens because people didnt wait to see how secure it was to hoard the gold before they did.
Well - i tried my best to explain why storing btc is, even as we speak, is as secure as gold, if not more. I feel quite safe storing my bitcoin on a hardware wallet than storing gold in my bank.

All big players want to make money and there is only one way to make it. You dont make money by trying to kill (completely) one of the most attractive asset classes. You will eventually want to take this as high as possible and make shit ton of money in the process. This is true even for those outside the echo-chamber. Just think about it. They may not care for what the technology truly brings to change the world in the far future, but they will not let go of any opportunity, specially one like this.
You think this asset class will never back to previous highs? Even if it drops further in the interim, you really think this wont ever come back up again? If yes - I am sorry to say this, you have brain the size of a walnut.
I am not a bitcoin or crypto maximalist. I am here to make money and I am quite certain the biggest of the bubbles is yet to come to pass.

You are again talking about exchange hacks. I can say the same thing about gold too if it wasn’t stored in a secure place.
Now why do you think bitcoin is not a store of value or can’t become one? Do you think gold was a store of value from day 1? It started as a form of currency, used for trading. For thousands of years, gold was used as a currency and only recently it became store of value. Who are you to say bitcoin has no reason to be store of value?

By the time bitcoin hits $1m, the amount of BTC held by each individual will go down by an order of magnitude. This is based on simple economics. For bitcoin to reach that kind of price tag, it would’ve become a household name and every other guy you know on the planet would have or willing to invest in it. As more people keep buying when supply is constant, you get smaller shares for everyone. Please do not assume top 100K holders of btc now will continue to hold forever.

I recommend you take a look at who are all interested in crypto markets and you will realise that big players are licking their fingers to use this new asset class to make shit ton of money. You clearly didnt see or aware of previous crashes which all eventually recovered and posted much higher prices every single time. Keeping aside whether this technology is going to be world changing or not, the fact that the big money sees this space as money making opportunity to the tune of trillions of dollars. The biggest bubble is yet to be formed before bursting and that will be in trillions.

Only difference here is that bitcoin hashrate is growing everyday and registering new ATH. The current hashrate is 3x more than the hashrate in Jan. This indicates that there are more miners competing to mine BTC than waiting it out.
Having said that, I dont think mining cost acts as a floor for btc price. Miners usually have long term plans and dont usually worry about short term price fluctuations.
I think people are looking Gilfoyle’s btc mining rig episode from silicon valley and assuming all miners follow that strategy.

You seeing 2K in future means nothing. Well, it might happen. If it’s a sure shot thing, why are so many even buying btc now at 5800 ? Best thing in this confusion is to stay put - try to dollar cost avg if you have more fiat or better yet, just wait it out.

But they banned everyone from buying/investing via almost all legit methods. No banks and financial institutions are to allow buying/selling cryptocurrency. This leaves only 1 option - cash based trading. Now I dont think it makes sense fpr RBI to allow trading/investment unless they allow banks and FIs - probably imposing heavy checks in place. While its certainly not clear how situation will unfold, but I for one, believe it wouldn’t make any sense whatsoever if RBI allows trading without letting banks/FIs involved (IF it ever happens).

You are short sighted by how things are in the short term. That is why you lack the understanding. Is bitcoin currently used to mostly make money? Yes, there is no denying it.

To say that it will continue to the flawed and will never be evolved shows your ignorance levels clearly.

Why do you store your bitcoin on an exchange? Exchange is not meant to store yout bitcoin the same way your office drawer (with no lock) is not meant to store your gold. You can lose gold if you dont store it safely - do you agree? The same is true for bitcoin too - you have safe storage options like hardware wallets and thats where you store them.
We are talking about bitcoin being store of value meaning you dont trade it often, meaning you dont store them carelessly on exchanges unless you are trading.

I am not going to say that the current market trend/cycle we are in has to necessarily match the cycle posted above. But for the sake of the argument, lets say it does.
Now - to identify where exactly you are, you need to compare the previous price points (before the bull run) when we felt depression or despair (with suckers rally). I don’t see anyone feeling depression or despair when we were at 5k-6k range last year. Hell - we weren’t in despair even at 2-3K levels. So I would say the last time we felt it was a suckers rally was probably when btc was just below $1000 or even $500. Now taking that into account, we can provably consider 2-3K levels is the lowest and the rally that starts after that dip will look like a suckers rally.
I dearly dearly hope that is not the case and I truly wish we already are in the beginning of suckers rally.

While I dont necessarily agree that investors only buy securities because of future cash flows, I will not argue on that point for now.

Based on 2014-15 bear trend, I predict BTC to be around 3k. 2015 Aug price was nearly half of 2014 Aug price. If 2018 is to follow the same trend (I have absolutely no strong arguments to support this), we should see half of 2018 aug price in 2019 - so around 3K.
However, I would hate to see it at 3k and will be happy to see between 7-10k atleast.

You don’t need to see BTC at 2k to believe very few investors believe in the future of bitcoin. Although the true believers count is slowly increasing, we are still very very very few with true belief. The massive influx of investors we saw from Nov 2017 are garbage retail investors who blindly bought something which was going parabolic. I bet half of them didn’t even know how to spell blockchain, let alone understand anything underlying about bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-13 07:37:17
How long can they continue to short? You really think the financial institutions launching futures to simply short bitcoin? If so then they could only do it for a very limited time. What is the upside for them to go through all the pain to just short it for say 6 months or 1 year? Doesn’t make sense, does it ?
@_date: 2018-12-01 06:44:37
When someone says we will not go down to 2k but 99% of reddit jumps in to say it could very well happen. This is same as someone in bull market saying we will not go beyond 20k but 99% of reddit contradicts him. When absolute majority believes in one direction, thats usually the turning point.
I can see pretty much everyone here saying 2k is possible and some even less than 1K. So ya, I am with the OP on this (although its kind of stupid to announce this bet with 44 btc at stake).

Price fluctuation is the current scenario. It can and will stabilise at somepoint in the future. But irrespective of that, the ability to move bitcoin with ease and for almost no cost will always be a constant. With LN (or layer 2 solution), it will be much more cheaper even if bitcoin becomes very expensive in the future.
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:48:00
First of all its ridiculous to think someone will keep shorting it till $1. Just because no one knows where bottom is, doesnt mean it can go to $1.
But even if we assume someone can continue to short for 15 months, is it really worth it? You see institutions planning this for long term play, for multiple years if they can. Thats how they think.
