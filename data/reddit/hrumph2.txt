You legally may not be able to do that if you're broke. You may have to go into liquidation proceedings.

I can see that zanetackett is trying to make it look like the safety deposit box scenario. Considering most or all of us didn't even have any private keys and the system was implemented as a complete black box relative to the users, I'm not buying it.

I'm not a libertarian and encountering people like you makes me less inclined to ever want to be one. The idea that because the coins were stored "separately" they can be treated that way is highly laughable. The joke is that they weren't separately stored at all. The thief had access to all of them.
BTW I *still* don't know if my wallet was affected or not, so I'm not talking from a position of self-interest.

Agreed, it makes no sense that some account-holders should skate while others get clobbered (simply on account of the luck of the draw). Also if they're now bankrupt, which they probably are, exactly how they're to redistribute their remaining assets (both USD and crypto) among users would probably have to be approved by a court as part of a restructuring plan, that is if they don't simply go into liquidation. I don't think that bankruptcy lawyers will let them summarily do as they please in this matter, even if the fine print of their user agreement allows them too. That's just Tackett saying stuff.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:07:18
That an interesting point. Why didn't Karpeles think of the bfx approach and announce that only "individual losses" had occured and go wash his hands?
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:26:02
That's what happens during liquidation, and if they manage to pull a chapter 11 that'll still be along the lines of what happens. The lawyers won't see one asset class as different from another when it comes to liability.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:06:12
They can't just unilaterally do this shit. If they can't cover liabilities they're insolvent, and anything they do will have to be approved by bankruptcy court.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:17:39
Agreed that it's a better outcome than I had hoped for.... But it still sucks and and overhaul of security isn't the only thing they need to do. They simply need a better team....Really...they need some people who really understand security because they sure don't.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:37:23
I don't like the sound of what he's saying at all.... First of all I don't know if my wallet was drained or not, so I don't even know if I would win or lose if it's treated as an individual loss matter. But from the vantage of the customers that simply not how it is. We didn't have any keys to those addresses. Admittedly I didn't pay any attention to the details of their system (being a blithe idiot who thinks that exchange security is a job for specialists). From the POV of your average customer the system was completely opaque. When I first learned of the hack my first reaction was to say "it's only their cold storage that was affected, right?"
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:18:16
Yes, exactly. Effectively bfx had a single big hot wallet.
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:03:05
I'm glad he's talking because he's telling us what they're thinking and it's good to have that info.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:12:58
They're broke if they can't cover liabilities to their account holders.
Edit: they could only do loss socialisation as part of a court-approved restructuring plan (IANAL and the laws everywhere are different but that what they were were saying about Gox)
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:00:46
Perfect summation of things as they stand now.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:16:08
Sounds as dumb as clef, which incidentally isn't real two-factor.
@_date: 2016-08-03 01:20:30
Why not just say "soonish"........
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:21:24
I read somewhere that gox has already burned through 55 million on bankruptcy fees. Do you really want to cut off your nose (and everyone elses) despite your face?
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:48:28
Also I don't see Tackett as doing anything heroic. Apart from implying that their going to stick it to the unlucky people, he's just saying "soonish", Karpeles style. He's not conveying anything useful in what he's saying.
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:05:17
If you're implying that you're going to give the lucky ones preferential treatment when it comes to a final settlement then this is unethical and doubtless illegal. It won't fly in court.
Edit: (Full disclosure)  I don't even know if my own wallet was afffected or not.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:22:15
Agreed. The books must now be opened.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:42:36
Then what's the point of bitgo even having a key if stuff on bfx's end determines its usage.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:27:38
I read somewhere that gox has already lost 55 million on bankruptcy fees. Do you really want to cut off your nose (and everyone elses) despite your face? Even if the number is inflated (i didn't check it) consider the time that has now passed when no single creditor has so far received a cent. I hate what has happened and I think that heads should be rolling in some fashion one day down the road but for now this plan is for the best.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:25:00
I don't know why people keep downvoting you. Tacket scoffed that the idea that bfx should compensate me after the double close issue (and I never got compensated for that.) Now *this*. F*(&amp;* the lot of them including Tackett. I want to see them all punished no matter what. It's only justice.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:34:38
Could be. As I a said I'm not a lawer, and I do recognise that the laws are different everywhere.
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:19:48
For most of us it's better than we had hoped. I would actually prefer that people not tie them up in lawsuits (not just yet anyway). Lawyers consume big money, far more money than some people naively realize. What I'd like to see right now from them is concrete action of various kinds to aright this ship.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:30:42
Just how "cold" was the cold storage key in practice?
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:54:17
Ok, but if this is the way bfx sees it, then the only understanding between them and the users was obscured in some fine print. I frankly don't even recall being asked to click yes to a new user agreement when they switched to multisig and the wallets became seperate. (Maybe it happened but I don't even remember *that*). For the bulk of users we just thought that bitfinex had a level of security equal to or better than cold storage.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:14:18
Thanks for this thinking. You may well be right. I'm eager to here the official explanation.
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:35:42
I favour the following. Creditor takeover using available assets, and all assets not required to restart the company should of course be immediately returned to creditors and I'd like this done as quicky as possible. This being said, I know that many are against this and just want straight up liquidation on the (arguably reasonable) grounds that creditor takeover coerces them into investing in something they don't want to invest in. Anyway I see both sides of the argument and still favour creditor takeover. For me its about maximising the long-term benefit for all creditors (big and small) and the people wanting total liquidation are being selfish and short-term minded. That being said, someone said that a vote of fifty percent of creditors was required for any creditor-takeover plan, but I assume that a creditor's vote will be weighted by actual the amount of credit owed to him/her, but I'd like this clarified. Another question is how long will any of this take (whatever course of action is decided)? On the specific issue of timeliness I think I might actually be speaking for a large majority segment of mtgox creditors, when I say that we want this resolved rapidly. I, for one, do not want lawyers steadily gnawing away a the assets in neverending battles.
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:58:55
Right now we need to get behind this efffort. Calling the people trying to make a difference right now "greedy douchebags" is uncalled for. Our only chance at getting everything at all is through a creditor takeover.
If this goes to liquidation, it will take years while lawyers fight over the scraps leaving us nothing in the end.
If you think that you'll do better through a liquidation, that's fine. You are entitled to that opinion, but that doesn't make people with a different opinion any more or less greedy than you are.

They're offering to give me back 2344.5 of 6537.61  USD lost from a good faith effort to close a position during the flash crash. I am guilty of hitting close more than once, but I refreshed before doing so and the info displayed in the browser obviously did not indicate that previous market orders had gone through (otherwise their engine would have bounced the new orders because they're not supposed to stack). I got caught in a loop of confusion where i was a short then a long etc, but since their web server was feeding me wrong info during the crash I feel wronged by bfx. I do not know how to respond to the offer.

People with Taiwan bank accounts have an amazing arbitrage opportunity.
@_date: 2017-04-26 21:25:58
Dude, they bank in Taiwan. It's no problem for people with Taiwan bank accounts to exchange USDT for USD. That's why Bitfinex treats USD and USDT as the same thing. Of course we'ere all a bit worried that the banking situation might get worse, but that's how things are for now.
