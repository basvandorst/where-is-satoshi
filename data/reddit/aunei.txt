Even if there were 10% fees, these don't matter if you're soliciting donations. These kind of TX fees are relevant for merchants whose margin on products isn't that high to begin with, but not for youtubers. People whining about TX fees for $random_payment_system will NOT lead to the creation of a new major video platform simply because it accepts BTC.

If your BTC-based remittance service has "conversion cost built-in" - i.e. it charges the user for those conversions - what advantage does it have over Western Union and how do you propose it could run at lower fees than Western Union?

How and where are you gonna convert BTC into NPR? You'd need to do it really quickly in order to not be exposed to the insane volatility. And I'm pretty certain that the amount of NPR waiting to buy BTC will not even cover a small fraction of a modestly sized remittance operation.

Nope, not saying that Ghash is worse than war at all, although my wording might have been poor. I don't contribute any tax dollars - different country - and I agree with you that the militarization of the world is unsettling. It's just that the Bitcoin community (if such a thing exists, it's quite an amorphous mass in my opinion) will not decrease military spending or be able to significantly contribute towards feeding and sheltering the poor of the world.
But yes, I was indeed accusing you of using this chart to try and cover up the mining oligopoly issue. It seems you may have had nobler intentions, in which case I apologize.

Why don't you keep that percentage down to a level where it won't be "really bad"? If BTC ever really takes off, you don't need to have 90% of your investments in it to become filthy rich.
@_date: 2014-06-08 18:01:21
Slightly more elaborate reply to your question:
Nodes have no way of securely finding out which pool mined a block. A given pool could change the IP that it broadcasts its TX from arbitrarily often. You would then need mining participants in every pool to track rewards and then you could possibly backtrack which pool mined it, but only long after the block has been accepted and the rewards were distributed. Also, the only way to reliably find that info would probably be a centralized database - and a centralized database that can shadow-ban blocks is arguably worse than the 51% risk.
All of this is not even considering the many ways in which a large pool could split up fairly transparently and make detection so much harder.

Where do you get the confidence that the strength of the network is rising?
I see two main measures for the strength of the network:
(a) the number of individual people/companies who control a given percentage of the hashrate
(b) the estimated cost to buy miners that will make up a certain percentage of the network
I think (b) may well be rising, but it's hard to quantify as all we know is what an Antminer or whatever sells for on the "aftermarket". Costs for organizations who fab their own chips may be very different.
(a), in my opinion, is not rising at all, especially if (b) is rising. The entry barriers for making a substantial entry into the market are quite high and it's hard to compete with existing infrastructure.

I think you're missing my point. BTC/USD exchanges work because those exchanges have buyers that will give them USD for BTC.
Nepali people getting money from overseas don't want USD. They want NPR. In order to have a working BTC/NPR exchange, you need people who want to spend their NPR for BTC. There not enough of those, you would never be able to cover the volume of even a small part of the remittance market!
You could of course convert to USD or EUR or CNY via some exchange, but then you will have to go through an additional fiat conversion with all the fees and banks attached, which is what you're trying to avoid in the first place.

Point taken, but my point still stands: You can't just use /dev/random because browsers don't let you access the FS, and with window.crypto.getrandomvalues you are at the mercy of the browser implementation both in terms of availability and backend. There is no guarantee that all browsers that support getrandomvalues will use /dev/random on *nix systems.

There is something to be said for storing addresses (not necessarily public keys) as well as private keys, as it means you can open the program to check balances etc _without_ accessing the private key that are in an encrypted storage, and only opening said encrypted storage when the user wants to make a transaction.
@_date: 2014-07-21 21:49:03


Well yeah, if - and then there's still the question when that saturation is reached. Maybe we're already there?

- This community is still young and therefore a lot of people really care about details and internals, but even then, the majority of people doesn't want *another* step (selecting a pool) to go through when making a BTC payment. Your proposal would prompt BTC apps affiliated to pools, funneling all TX fees to them, or more likely, most apps would simply stick to the old fees system.
- Why would any merchant or user trust a message from a pool that says "we'll include this TX at some point"? This subverts one of the core principles of the blockchain - you trust confirmations because they will be ingrained into the blockchain, which is stored in lots of places, cryptographically verifiable and hard to "reverse".
