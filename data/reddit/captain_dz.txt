Kids in highschool buying stuff on silkroad, had to be untraceable so people used Bitcoin. Didn't think much of it at the time (btc was probably around $5 at this time, maybe less), jumped in heavy in crypto when BTC was $800 and its been great ever since :)

Only reason people are bearish on comments and calling "bull traps" anytime it rises is because they have sold and want to buy cheaper and think their comments can help push the market down.

Well it's winter right now but in the summer get a vendor license (easier to do then you think, ask your dad for help) then buy a pack of 24 water bottles for $3 and sell them for $1 each at the park or somewhere busy on a hot day.

You gambled with your parents money which they borrowed. There's nothing you can do other then to either hodl or to cash our now and get another job to help pay them back. Never invest what you can't afford to lose. At this point if I were you I would would be busting my ass off working a part time job.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:59:41
Its the kids that invested in it 2 months ago and are at a huge loss. They're the morons for buying something that went up 200% with no correction and now they try to come into this community and spread fud everywhere on something they know nothing about. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:26:43
No period at the end of your sentence. Nice shit comment bro.

@_date: 2018-02-01 18:43:10
Yep, only people at a loss are fomo investors that bought high... lesson learned for them 
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:38:36
They are naive people who have to completely shit on any positive news because 1. They never bought any and watched Bitcoin succeed and are now filled with jealousy and envy 2. they fomo bought the big pump and are at huge losses (that of which they have already sold) and now feel they must trash on BTC as much as possible to make them feel better for their decisions. It's very true, nobody wants to face themselves and blame their own lack of judgement, they want to blame others because that's a whole lot easier. The good news is despite what they think or say, Bitcoin will still thrive and they will all repeat the cycle.

"Ive been in Bitcoin for 2 months and bought in after it went up 200% with no correction and now must spread fud because I am at a loss buying extremely high" 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:40:00
Above 20k. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:20:45
Instructions unclear: Fomo bought at 16k because I thought I could get rich buying into a hype fest... Lost half my money because I am bufoon who bought high on something that was already up 200% with no correction... I am 19 years old and my $200 is worth $100 now.... So depressed :(
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:22:56
Im willing to bet he wouldn't be fudding if he did. Sold too early and now salty forever.

Id say its currently a little under priced yes. Hopefully April brings in some bullishness back to the market. We wait until lightning launches for the real tide to turn.

I seriously dont understand the thought process of people that bought in at 18k. "Oh look at this, Bitcoin is up 200% with no correction, it can't possibly go down". You got GREEDY, you bought in too high thinking you could get rich quick. Know the risks, only invest what you can afford to lose and don't buy something that went up that much with no correction.

Get out of here old man, this isn't for you. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:21:41
I remember about year ago on this sub when it was around $1000 and people thought that was going to be the ATH and those that said it could go to 10k were "Crazy"... 1 year later and its the same thing except now there is even more fud. Everyone that cashed out hoping to buy lower is doing their part in spreading as much fud as possible so they can validate their decision and to try to get other people to dump so they can buy lower. When the market reverses and they all buy in again the mindset will change again. Those that bought in above 15k chasing the pump are not very smart to begin with and now are like a plague. 
inb4: but itz nevar going to 10k evar again, how dare I shill this coin. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:16:23
It is the same as cashing out except you're not in FIAT you're in tether which is an alt coin. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:08:18
Oh please, there is a difference between buying something going up 200% with no correction vs buying something down 60% after a massive correction. Please wait to buy at 5k, you will be waiting forever. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:43
but 8.5k to 20k in a few weeks isnt?

If you're willing to get away from the creditcards you can open an account on quadrigacx (the biggest Canadian exchange) and e-transfer or bank transfer funds to buy BTC. Or you can get cash together and buy on localbitcoins.com.
Stay away from ATM's, the fees are way too high.

Would someone have to use their ID with this ATM? I know it requires a cell phone number, but the government wouldn't be able to trace that to an individual down the line would they? I'm assuming no as its just a phone number... But you never know

Just buy on an exchange that accepts Visa Credit Cards.
