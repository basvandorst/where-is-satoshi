What I mean is that I don't think access was gained via my computer via them sitting there or remoting in. If they did it was months ago.  Hindsight is 20/20. my fault for keeping an address for a long period.
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:10:08
No.  It was password, then emailed confirm code then I could log in.  However my wallet was emptied without them logging in.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:25:43
I forgot to mention that this hasn't turned me off from bitcoin at all;  but dear god, if a person like me can get owned I fear for the average user.  I don't think I'll ever really feel like my coins are secure again.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:36:40
I know they weren't in my email because of the security.google.com information.  All the IP addresses were mine.  Also 2FA
my password was 22 characters upper and lower with symbols and spaces
I had used that address for quite some time.  This was not a good idea.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:05:39
Really nice info there.  Really troubling too.  thank you.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:52:09
Phone not linked to blockchain.  Fire walled.  Looking at crashplan as a possibility.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:38:35
great point. Added.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:50:28
Exactly.  I figure someone got the encrypted aes file somehow from the email backup.  
In other news I did find that I had downloaded the wallet.aes.json on 12/14/2013 to put into my crashplan.  I'm guessing this is how the attacker got it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:18:50
they were left in gmail.
@_date: 2014-03-15 18:57:14
thanks, I'm looking into it
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:31:49
I would say so.  I use google authenticator  for 2 other sites.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:27:26
My guess is that If I got owned it was my windows box as well.  However they did it, they did a damn good job.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:16:26
Thanks for the sentiment.  I've wasted far more bitcoins in the past, and I keep my other coins in a safer place, but it still hurts to get hit.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:37:12
This is good advice.  I do have a paper wallet that was unaffected.  This was my play account.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:06:13
Well the whole problem with my experience is that they didn't even need the 2FA or login.  they swiped a backup from gmail somehow without triggering gmail 2fa either.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:38:33
Thanks for the beer!  I'll pass it along someday :)
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:22:45
   
Edit: signed
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:27:13
Just checked.  No extension.  I did however visit coinkite briefly on that day.  I didn't use the site.  Besides the thief would have needed to login right? Then it would have triggered the 2 factor email...
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:44:59
Anything's a possibility.  Those with access to my computer are not that smart.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:27:42
good tip to know about in the future
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:29:06
my password was 22 characters mixed upper lower and symbols
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:09:13
windows and mac.  Not a trace of how it might have happened.  i looked through 25 different logs,  all computers patched, clean etc.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:18:13
Signed up for the 14 day trial, just to see how things work.  Could be my new hot wallet.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:29:41
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:29:08
Magical,  thanks!
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:23:05
Will do.  I chose the personal, but no idea about the payment.  How does the promo work?
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:36:55
Yes,  that is the bug I was talking about. I use Firefox on my mac and the site to test for the vulnerability reported things were okay.  Also I hadn't logged into my blockchain account in at least 3 or 4 months on my mac
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:50:46
nope I never did anything like that.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:31:38
Just checked gotofail.com and my mac is/was not vulnerable to this attack
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:38:55
I did.  Nothing to report.  If gmail was open in a tab already then it wouldn't make a difference.  Also my wallet was encrypted
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:26:12
I do use a mac,  no it wasn't the pop up blocker or the security vulnerability 
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:35:10
I use avira and malwarebytes,  let's see what they come up with.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:33:31
Firefox and chrome.  Both passed   
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:30:26
the backups only ever hung out in gmail.  
I might do some playing around with the address still, but I'll release the key in a week.  the address was  	13EwBPgS5shLT7cdrJH37PuX3WX6bRVZhD
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:09:37
Was it you?  you dog.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:17:11
I don't really know.  I wish I had figured out what I did wrong.  But read this  
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:34:03
Stock.  Also no blockchain app.  And I run lookout security.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:50:50
I'm really hoping it's some sort of tumbler or exchange....
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:17:24
No update yet.  The more I think about it the more impossible it seems that my actions caused the breech.  I haven't found any signs of malware, backdoors or network breaches yet.  Also all of my wallet backups were encrypted.  I did contact support,  will update on that front.  I still want to know what type of address this is 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:14:50
Thank you for this information.  I'll do this in the future.  I'm glad it was only one coin
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:08:04
Possible.  Very Possible. I have used the blockchain website from my place of work.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:56:53
both email and blockchain are unique passwords, I accept responsibility for using the same address for a long time.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:13:13
this is a tough one.  my wallet.dat was also aes encrypted.  Oh and 2FA on gmail where it was stored.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:35:29
If you have a blockchain account enable second password and you can restrict to IP
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:18:06
Whoever did it nailed a shitload of people take a look at this  
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:37:38
It's cuz I clicked on   isn't it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:14:04
I had 2FA on my gmail where the AES wallet was stored.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:06:14
wow!  That's fascinating.  If this is the case, shouldn't there be a lot more pissed off users?  this graph is cool though 
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:10:52
On both blockchain.info and my gmail account.  Neither of which show any abnormal activity.  Whoever did it, did it from my machine by using an open google session, or some other local way.  Or I have a phone app that steals gmail info... and I don't download random apps.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:06:55
salt in the wound :)
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:29:39
Yep.  Pretty terrible.  I feel for you.
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:36:09
nothing there.
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:34:17
The loss of coins doesn't bother me nearly as much as not knowing how they did it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:32:06
    The attacker did not get my coins via a blockchain.info login.  They took the coins on feb21.  The last time I logged in was on the 12th here's the log.  Somehow they snagged my private key.  which I now understand know was not encrypted.

@_date: 2014-02-28 19:34:14
Yeah, I noticed that too.  The fun part is how young that wallet is, and the crazy incoming outgoing transactions.  I kinda assumed it was some sort of tumbler?
Oh shit, last I looked it had an empty balance and had done 46,000 bitcoin in transfers in then out
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:09:38
This is all good and true information,  but the attacker didn't gain access via the blockchain.info site.  I had 2FA for gmail and 2FA for Blockchain.  The it was 10 days after my last login that my coins were taken.  There was no login the day my coins were swiped.  I guess they got the private key somehow.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:33:08
It was enabled. Whoever got my coins did it to many.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:45:13
7he C0w jump5 o\/er the m0on!
it was along the lines of that.  
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:32:22
I reviewed all the login activity on my computers.  Nothing out of place,  besides if they could do that, they would have just logged into my account. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:31:52
Just checked gotofail.com and my mac is/was not vulnerable to this attack
@_date: 2014-02-26 21:20:06
Windows 8.1  and 10.7.5 osx
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:47:16
I'm tempted to put a little back in the account to see if it gets emptied again.

I'm checking it out, thanks :)
