THIS PUMP IS A BEAR TRAP, BE WARNED!!! 
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO POSITIVE INFLUENCE FOR THIS SURGE IN PRICE OTHER THAN IT BEING WHALE MATING CALL.
 ONLY 1,000 INDIVIDUALS OWN 50% BITCOIN MARKET, A FEW MOUSE CLICKS AND THEY CAN ROCK IT WITH A SHRUG. 
STAY SAFE!

I’d halt from buying until we begin recovering from the dip we’ll see in the next few days due to Asia’s regulations
