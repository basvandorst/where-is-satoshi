100K by 2023 or I don't eat my own cawk

How did you manage to do so pathetic in the Roth? Even an S&amp;P fund would have crushed you.

What are the recommended places to buy? I have a Coinbase account. Fine somewhat but liquidity is an issue. They won’t let me withdraw for like 14 days after deposit. Cash app banned me for unknown violation, all i did was buy and withdrawal to my external wallet multiple times. Then all of the sudden ban hammered out of nowhere.
@_date: 2019-10-17 16:19:40
Fook those guys they banned and all I ever did was buy btc and transfer out to external wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-25 14:55:10
Will be back around 6-7k in no time.
@_date: 2019-09-12 20:09:32
wet garbage as a payment system srs. No mass adoption usage until it doesn't suck. Right now just a bunch of people hodling not actually used for much of anything.
@_date: 2019-09-10 20:24:31
When will u guys admit you have no fookin clue where its going?
@_date: 2019-09-12 20:07:15
It needs to not be hot trash as a payment system before moon.
@_date: 2019-05-20 16:40:45
It took about 5 or 6 days after y first buy to get verified and be able to withdraw. After initial setup you can do it instantly.  When I did this their scanner thing was broken so they had you email pictures. I'm suprised they havent emailed you back, it always took them 24 to 48 hours to respond but they did respond.

The delusion is strong with some of you (not all here friends). 40% chance to be over 200,000 and 99% chance to be up? How did you come up with these numbers geek?

Its just throwing darts. You don't know shit, neither do I, or anyone else here. 
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:35:54
seems legit
@_date: 2019-05-17 20:18:43
past results does not indicate future performance, etc.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:48:07
@_date: 2018-12-10 16:01:39
still like 400% above 2017 starting price. Don't think we have seen the bottom but I'm just a sorrybodybuilder who knows nothing. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:23:31
lettuce not forget bitcoin started 2017 around $900. This drop was inevitable, it should have never risen so far so fast. Long term holders are still bathing in gains and watching scarface in the hot tub. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 20:20:13
Just let me get 10K in 2020. Dont even need moon.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:33:52
didnt know you were talking about shitcoins mate. I'm in a bitcoin thread.
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:30:48
Are you from the future?

@_date: 2018-12-13 15:08:34
I now have roughly 40% less purchasing power in BTC than when I bought just a month or so ago. Volatility is why it fails as p2p payment system as intended. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 17:23:14
sub 2k surely in near future.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:45:58
Mcafee said million by 2020, I can hold until then.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:03:54
what leads you to believe the price is low? 
@_date: 2018-12-06 20:42:38
0 fuks given about daily price swings. 0 fuks given about short term. This is a long game. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:31:57
bitcoin has been perverted by greed, fraud, and speculation. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:06:23
convince me not sell. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:48:07
It’s didnt gain 50% so there’s that.

I wanna talk to Sampson
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:36:56
surely sub 2k in next month or two
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:02:27
BTC is basically at a real ATH considering the mythical 20K run was a fraud built on manipulation.
@_date: 2018-12-06 21:56:52
Bitcoin is crypto. Iphones suck ass but dominate the market.

I’m entertained by all the geeks talking about whales and pumps.

Would not be suprised to see sub 1k in 2019. hope I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2019-05-21 18:24:50
There is no guarantee BTC price stays over the current 8k level in the future. Don't state speculation/your personal belief as fact to someone asking for advice.
@_date: 2018-12-17 17:36:16
25k they said..

Only the hard may call themselves hodlers. Only the hard. Only the strong. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:30:57
Its not a stock the swings are muh greater. Considering its been as high 20k and spent a lot of this year around 6 to 7k, I dont find 10k in 2 years unreasonable. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 15:35:19
How come nobody told me to buy in 2010/2011? I always wonder how people heard and then decided to buy in the early days. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 16:00:44
thats the good weed
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:46:03
People are trying to establish the narrative that 2018 was a huge disaster for btc and that it is on its last leg and will be dead soon. This couldn't be further from the truth. 2018 was not a failure for btc. Several advancements and substantial investments in the industry show the future is bright. Price is just a part of the story and this is a long game. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:15:14
Well done mate. Stay the course and be consistent, sustainability is the key now that youve finished initial cut.  
@_date: 2018-12-13 20:41:32
I'm not sure that it is shifting into mainstream culture. These drastic drops hurt adoption. Its an unreliable way to pay for things because you can lose purchasing power rapidly with this volatility. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:28:01
these predictions arent worth a wet fart
@_date: 2019-05-20 15:58:44
probably fraud and manipulation like the phony run to 20k in 17'.

@_date: 2018-12-06 22:17:49

@_date: 2019-05-17 19:46:47
Its a bit hyporcritical to call skeptics blind while acting like higher prices are a 100% certainty.
