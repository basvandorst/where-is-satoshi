You’re right, I’m probably way over my head, but the whole electricity thing has been blown way out of proportion, we live in an oil rich nation, electricity is super cheap, I’m pretty sure I saw a list that said Kuwait is the seventh best country to mine in, and Venezuela was the first.. is everyone waiting in line to call me a horrible person taking that into account? Cause if not there might still be hope that this could work out...

Dude what do think I’m saving up for, I’ve been tryna get the hell out since I came back from college... y’all are really out here judging me for the way that you think I am which is not just totally inaccurate but also completely against my character, the person y’all are assuming I am is a dick and I’d hate that guy too, I’m just not that guy. I hate Kuwaitis (especially the entitled ones. God, can everyone calm the fuck down??

I have a job SMH ��‍♂️ everyone on here now thinks I’m an asshole mooching of daddy’s money...  Guys I swear I’m not a bum ��

They know about it tho? They don’t care, I’m not stealing anything from anybody dude calm down
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:16:19
Like I told willinglyunemployed I don’t pay for electricity ��

I’m tryna gain my own financial freedom, they live like kings while I live in the basement trying everything I can to start my own life up. so yeah they’re loaded and I’m broke, and instead of acting all spoiled and expecting them to share their wealth I’m taking initiative and trying out different hustles to get to where I wanna be, they know I’m mining and are expecting the electricity bills, something that I AM grateful for, there’s nothing standard about my situation so pls don’t judge me or my morals... I’m just tryna get out of this hellhole and stay true to myself, something I hope y’all can respect...

And? I don’t get what linking something I put out myself and clearly fine with being public has to do with anything? Are you tryna  embarrass me? Cause if so you seem just as immature as everyone thinks I am right now...

Parents, and trust me they don’t care, Kuwaiti electricity is cheap and they’re wealthy enough for me to not feel guilty. If anything, it feels only fair, but there’s a lot of family drama to unpack there so I’m not tryna think too much about that rn ��

I don’t currently pay for electricity, but I might have to worry about that later so thanks for the input, should I just pick whatever is on the top of that list every time I’m thinking of adding to the farm?
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:01:13
I’m not sure they’ll care lol, here in Kuwait electricity is hilariously cheap, plus they’re loaded ��

Not really, in Kuwaiti culture most dudes usually live at home until they’re married, they want me here, I’m the one tryna get out, and yes I do intend on paying them back for everything one day, even though they’ve made it clear they don’t even want me to. I’m very fortunate to be in the position I’m in, the day I forget that, y’all can call me a mooch till my ears bleed

Yup, Kuwaiti infrastructure is top notch, at least for us, we were the first house in the country to set up a fiber optic internet connection, idk if it’s my dads connections with telecommunications and similar industries, but we never really had a problem with blackouts, internet, etc, anything wired into this house is built to last and with performance in mind..,

Dude relax, look at my replies to everyone else to get a better idea of who I am, I have a job and my parents know I’m mining and are alright with it thankfully.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:25:23
You lost me at estimated batch release calculations, Laymen terms people. Imagine I’m an Idiot who doesn’t get any of this... which is painfully accurate Rn... fuck, I’m out of my depth here, aren’t I?
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:10:25
Oof harsh dude, you don’t know the dynamic between me an my parents, so pls reserve your judgment for another topic you might be more informed on ❤️
@_date: 2019-05-08 12:55:44
Alright so should I upgrade my miners as often as possible to keep up with this? Or did I completely miss the point and look like an idiot? ��  oh, and thanx for actually being helpful people are just jumping on to call me a mooch rn and I appreciate the genuine help ��
