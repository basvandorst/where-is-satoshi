This sub is full of idiots who think that just because they have a few bitcoins it automatically makes them a genius at economics.

Nice announcement. Now you’re a target good job. I don’t know why people do this. If I became a millionaire from BTC I’d shut the fuck up and just enjoy it.

It’s not movies it’s reality. Specially since OP is not crazy high profile he’s easier to target. It happens to a lot of people.

You’re laughing now but when it crashes I’m buying all your bitcoins for the cheap. I’ll be sitting back and getting rich while you’re depressed as fuck.

I’m not going to short bitcoin because I’m not a dickhead short. I fucking hate shorts. I see bitcoin potential but I know there going to be a hard crash. People in this sub are so delusional and that’s going to cost them their life savings.

I love watching the posts in this sub because you guys make up the dumbest and funniest shit to hype yourselves up.

Elon Musk man. He is my hero forever.

You guys are delusional as fuck. I’m gonna feel really bad when you guys get fucked over and go homeless.

No I’ve been watching news and the potential of bitcoins. If bitcoin is ever going to be used by countries and everyone it’s value will crash so it can be more stable. You’re all thinking you’re going to be millionaires for some stupid reason when in reality you’re investing too early in something that is unstable and will crash.

I’m calling bullshit. Some of you are so sad.

I disagree. I didn’t get into stock until I got into bitcoin. Bitcoin is like a gateway drug into stocks.

Y’all are cringy as fuck
