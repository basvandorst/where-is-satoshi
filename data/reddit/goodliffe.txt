Thanks Infinite!  I was just trying to decide how to approach Coinbase / GDAX.  I guess I can just set up a GDAX account and do everything thru there.
Then I don't need the Coinbase account?

Yep i just found that out :P  Now i need to go to Frys electronics to buy a cam for my desktop cuz i don't have a laptop with a cam to complete the ID verification.
(I do 3D / VR dev work at home and keep my dev machine lean as possible without extra crap slowing it down.)
I'll let you know how things go with GDAX.  
I know all the sites are getting overwhelmed with newcomers clamoring for BTC, etc.  So they are all slow, unreliable and support sux uniformly.  
But its a good thing cuz it means crypto is growing and a rising sea lifts all ships!

Hey icanfly, i just started 2 weeks ago, and am figuring things out slowly but surely.  I've traded fiat stock for years, so I'm familiar with the fundamentals.
Coinbase is hq'd in San Francisco, with a known team, etc.  They are likely to be much safer than the vast majority of companies with only an email for contact info in some other country.
For deposits, withdrawls and trading, use I'm gonna use GDAX instead of Coinbase.  The coinbase fees are way too high.
I'm planning to use a hardware cold storage like "Ledger Nano S" for the bitcoin and other crypto that i'm not actively trading.  Like a locked safe in your home.  It's where you store the coins you don't use all the time.
On my Jaxx phone wallet, I'll keep extra coins that i may transfer to GDAX or other site for trading.  Think physical wallet that you carry in your pocket.
On GDAX i'll keep coins that i'm actively trading.  Think "checking account".  
These aren't perfect analogies, but close enough to get the basic idea.
Crypto gurus, please correct me if i'm wrong, and if you have better ideas.  I love to learn from experts! :P
