Fair enough, I stand corrected. Thanks. :)

Thanks for the update, I was starting to wonder where my bitcoins were.
I should probably check twitter more.

IIRC various US federal agencies hacked silk road servers and made copies of the contents while they were still operational. Then from this (allegedly illegally) obtained evidence they secured warrants against Ulbricht.
So I think the initial 'searches' of foreign servers may be covered by 4th Amendment if leased directly to Ulbricht (or another US citizen), with subsequent evidence covered by 'fruit of the poisonous tree'.

Ah, well that's certainly more interesting. I guess we'll just have to wait and see.
I wonder if this may be a case where the FBI asked local authorities in an attempt to avoid 4th Amendment complications then? And maybe the Ulbricht defence is that it should still be protected because of the initial request from a US agency?
I have to admit though, that's just me thinking out loud and may be completely wrong.

The idea is that if a transaction hasn't got any confirmations, you throw in a second transaction trying to spend the same inputs, which kind of voids both of them.
Then miners won't confirm either transaction, leaving you to have all your bitcoins floating around but still not in your wallet.
Then there's probably some way to get the void transactions back in your wallet. (Does the network purge void transactions from the confirm queue?)

Also it has been alleged by Andrew Lewman, the Executive Director of Tor Project, that NSA and GCHQ staff are informing the Project of bugs that the agencies find.

It seems that different countries/operators have different shortcodes, found the appropriate one on the [twitter help pages.](

... which is a fluctuation of 30%.
Just because the value is roughly the same at two arbitrary points in time it doesn't mean the price doesn't fluctuate.

British territories incluce Jersey, Guernsey, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands.. etc etc. You could maybe argue Isle of Man too... None of them are the taxman's friend, but we've never had any incentive to crack down on them while the Swiss and Luxembourg are still operating secretive banking systems.
