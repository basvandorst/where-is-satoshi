Just sent this to a friend in HR.
"I feel like this butter is a potential recruit. We should send him the pamphlets, maybe even offer him a position just on the strength of this post. If he turns his cynicism into wretched fiat slavery scrip by joining the shill team he could have a bright future. It's very exciting to see someone dedicated enough to freelance FUD and we should reward his passion. I have talked to Mark in psyops and he agrees."
Wish this little butter luck!

He has literally no reason to accept your bet, at least while acting in good faith. If he is wrong, he loses money. If he is right, you will never pay out. 
Out of a profound commitment to charity, I will assume you had the intelligence to understand this when you said it. The only conclusion can then be that you must be using the bet to avoid having to verify your claim. In other words, you're as full of shit as the toilet I'm sitting on.

We are in fact the same person. Sorry. I just use this account to prop myself up when I feel like I'm losing an argument. 
Set up the escrow and let's get this started. I don't know very much about smart things like Bitcoin, so I can't actually say for sure whether you have 2000 or not, but I'm inclined to think you do and I feel you should be rewarded for your perception. Since this is basically free money for you, go ahead and get it all lined up and I will deposit all the bistcoins I have.

Ok, I agree to all your terms.
