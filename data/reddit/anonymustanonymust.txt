I would say invest no more than 10% of whatever income you have. 
Make changes in your life to save money when possible (no drugs, fast food, cigarettes, alcohol etc.. etc..)
Don't throw it all into Bitcoin, what ever bitcoin you have today (that 10% of your income) should be work  much more in the future.
Time is your factor here, and please dont jump into trading markets and use leverage. If you want to make money.. Buy ~~low~~ **now**, sell high!
I made $23 buying low, selling high on GDAX the past 30 days. Study the markets. 
Just my two ~~cents~~ satoshis. Good luck, we're all on the same boat!

Well. If He sold Say only half of his BTC when forked. And kept all thier BCASH
I'm sure the ½ BTC bags that they hodl'd is still worth more than BCASH

**Agree**, yet sometimes looking at transfer fees are scary. for Noobs who invest less than $100 it seems like a loss.

My bad for the horrible wording, I know coinbase to GDAX transfers are free. 
But from what I read, the user /Sunny245 wants to get them off of online wallet. since he doesn't have the keys.
Moreover, I think the user wanted to know "where should I put my coints to get both BTC and Segwit2X coins"

Who currently supports the fork? I want want in on the airdrop, but not too sure about risking my BTC for SX2 coins.

Google. Just a few weeks ago some teenager has been dominating the news. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:33:36
Source for this? Im having difficulty understanding the fork and the "free BCC coin" concept floating around the interwebs.

@_date: 2017-07-31 06:24:28
Can you take BTC loans there?
How does one pay it back then if they don't have BTC, do they take the money automatically from bank accounts?
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:30:29

@_date: 2017-07-28 07:51:44

@_date: 2017-07-30 21:11:14
If anyone calls my phone to request payment for bitcoin, it better be my Mom. 
All other calls will be rejected. **simple**,
Rule of thumb my dad told me, if anyone calls you for money, make sure you call them back to ensure it was them

Uhm and Henner, care to explain to me now what "buy BTC on margin" means?
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:42:30


How are you gonna "split" your coins, i though this happens automatically?
Im bout to put my coins on a paper wallet, this means I get BCC and BTC after the fork.. am I correct?
@_date: 2017-07-19 09:10:15
Depends what machine you buy. 
It's best you just buy the coins direct work €10k
Check the FAQs, there is a link for calculating mining rewards based on what specs you fill in. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:48:24


Isn this what will exactly happen? The BTC community doesnt want BCC, but apparently with this fork we all get BCC!
Then we all sell our BTC. Correct me if I am wrong, plz
