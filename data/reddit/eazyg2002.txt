Someone who has the game should ask them to update it to the newer video

I think this is the problem though. People are getting funny about the word "bits" and its not important. (what's important is moving that decimal point) to me "bits" is simple and logical it's a part of the word bitcoin, "how many bits in a bitcoin"  I think it will be loginlcal for the general public not confusing. What will be confusing is all this mBTC, uBTC etc. The sooner everyone can agree to bits, that has been suggested and talked about by Andreas etc the better I say.

sweet. more btc advertising. its like they're asking to lose.
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:46:10
Does mBTC = bits?
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:32:32
If only everyone would just HODL!

Wasn't this neo&amp;bee's genius plan? 
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:58:10
haha, nice.

Needs to link to UK banks. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:03:28
As I understand, it will be 100% open source when it is released. (REV3)
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:55:54
what will the charges be on this (if it works) could you let us know? Cheers.
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:28:40
Lol,  sorry.  Was a reference to a biggie lyric.  I was drunk.  Haha
@_date: 2014-09-29 19:10:53
Thanks for this, but i think I found the answer in this thread 
basically debit cards seem to work and its about 3% charge. :)
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:22:44
I thought this thread was related to coinshuffle/meshnets. XC will be open source on REV3 release. No one is trying to get any money off anyone. Get back on topic or stfu.

Does it do this? That's great news if so! (I can't play it unfortunately, waiting for an android version)
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:13:28
Really hope this happens!
@_date: 2014-05-23 12:56:13
Can everyone just hurry up and agree to change it to bits! 
@_date: 2014-11-10 16:14:24
Blasphemy! lol
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:23:36
I hate it when mainstream media reports crashes because you have to deal with your non bitcoin mates. lol
@_date: 2014-05-11 00:59:24
Hope it was free
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:30:30
My answer to these kind of questions is "ask me in a year or so" 
@_date: 2014-10-05 15:59:56
@_date: 2014-09-29 17:26:26
Can't wait till I can link my UK bank account.  
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:39:34
Thanks! I'd really appreciate that if you could :)

If this was roulette, and red was up in price and black was down in price, what would you bet on? 
@_date: 2015-04-27 22:13:48
I really like the "weathered low-fi"  look and recon you should stick with it. I also like the more subtle bitcoin shirts.  This is the first one I have seen that I would wear as its not just a blatant bitcoin advert.  Regarding the price,  why not have an option for both?  Good quality or cheap print. Just make it very clear on the site that you get what you pay for. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 23:12:27
If you can manage to keep the quality up and still make a profit,  I'd say $19.99 is a fair price. ;-)
