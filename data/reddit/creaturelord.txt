1.Imagine posting up with the homeless guys at an ATM while refreshing the coinmarket site on my phone for 5 hours till I finally get that 1 minute bull run. I successfully make 0.00001 BTC. Then the hobos stab me and run away with my bitchcoins.
2.I'm not a criminal, atm. Which one is good for me?

I get you're used to banging wild warthogs, but listen here mate, once you've riden a Ferrari there's no going back to a Honda Civic.

Wish I knew how to play poker man. Too many plays. Flush, dish, dash, slog, whatever.
Same for selling illegal substances online.
