Well, good for your that you can't buy bitcoin, because bitcoin transaction fees are higher than Western Union.
Welcome to 2018 when no one actually uses bitcoin for small transactions like sending $200 to your family.

They will not survive a prolonged bear market like after MtGox.

Just buy from the exchanges you idiot and make it a new ATH
@_date: 2018-02-06 07:28:47
For last 30 days is over -60% and from ATH is about -70%
As good a crash as it gets.
