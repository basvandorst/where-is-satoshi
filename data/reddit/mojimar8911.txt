@_date: 2017-12-01 01:11:38
People are hearing 5000$ per bitcoin and now thinking 10 k is too much.
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:10:05
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:02:52
I didn't expect this to be the case but fuck it crypto Christmas for you all.  The amount of btc will be all 3's and 0's so u know it's from me.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:52:40
I vote all.  Bitcoin does not sleep at all.

This tech is still new.  These exchanges cannot keep up with demand and they want to play by the rules .  We will see good things over time.  Glad to see they responded.   We all need to keep our eyes open.  
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:38:51
How are the Bitcoin exchanges interconnected and how is this similar and different than traditional markets?

"Bitcoin is still a mystery to many of us, probably because we can’t eat, see or touch it.". 
Do we eat any other currency?
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:09:07
It seems like it's like trading.  There are buy orders and sell orders.  The trade won't take place till there is agreement. 
 With the futures the short order will be listed and then it won't activate until a person long agrees to it and vice versa.  Then wait for predetermined time to go by ( I guess it could be the next minute or the next 10 years). There may be limits on price and time but it would be determined by the original person initially announcing his short/long position.  He/She is waiting for someone to take them up on his/her bet.

People sell fake jewelry all the time.  And there are so many metals and gems that have value to certain people. I wonder about all the scams during the gold rush.   Bitcoin really is the best example of digital gold.  Alts and forks will have their own value for better or worse.

I think 1 million in 5 yrs.  Slower movement to 10 mil.  Bitcoin will spend the majority of it's life between 10 mil and 100 mil or 1 billion.

I don't know.  Maybe a large group also got done watching their first Andreas video lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:41:05
True, but choose when to stop investing and then HODL when you feel it's right and that will be your price point.   I think you will feel when depositing fiat seems useless.

We're on the verge of a revolution that had never been seen before.  Welcome to the blockchain era!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:42:02
We don't believe the mainstream media when it comes to Bitcoin.  Why are we listening to them about CO2 and climate change or anything?  Stop perpetuating FUD.  The government and media have that job on lock.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:17:36
The government needs us more than we need them.

I sent you the most because your new.  Welcome to the blockchain era.  HODL!

People aren't choosing between a dog feeder and crypto.  But my general answer is that your question doesn't matter.  It is based off a FUD mentality.

Oil is not the only energy
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:35:30
Whenever a new person enters Bitcoin with let's say 100$.  Just HODL 2 years.  I suggest throwing small amounts of fiat every paycheck over that time and you will win.

There is a bigger portion of the world watching the market.  The dips won't last long.

It's a good thing there is not a finite amount of energy.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:02:19
I saw that there is a 20% over/under limit.  My thinking is that you will see bigger swings in the price but no more than 20 % more than were used to.  
The 20% is only one of the Chicago exchanges.  May be different for others.

@_date: 2017-01-04 21:24:35
Cool thanks guys.  Sort of what I thought and you guys helped explain things about hardforks and LN that I've seen on this sub.  So I understand it 2% more maybe.   Lol I'm obviously new to btc and I'm getting pretty deep a lot quicker than I thought.

When you use your minimum wage to buy bitcoin you soon learn that you worked for a lot more than minimum wage.  Good job sir.
@_date: 2018-11-13 22:49:09
If you don't see a problem with this then you don't get it.  If there is no accountability then there is no incentive to follow the rules.  With Bitcoin there is is an incentive to follow the rules.  This will lead to more efficiency and less waste.  The world will get it some day.
@_date: 2018-11-13 23:59:30
So your proving my point.
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:42:13
Destroyed is the answer.  Excorporated!

They did a physical run on the banks. Now a financial run.
@_date: 2019-01-10 17:40:13
The point of Bitcoin is to collapse the finance and grow a real economy.
@_date: 2019-01-04 17:20:40
I like the year 2026 for this because it's 250 years after the USA was founded.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:22:30
Exactly.  The government will collapse with or without Bitcoin present.  It's just lucky for us that Bitcoin is an alternative.
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:24:36
Add 1 billion USD to current market cap of BTC then divide by current number of mined coins.   
@_date: 2018-03-29 20:11:19
Bitcoin isn't about making money.  It's about making money work properly.

More like 2018 -2022.  This will happen quicker than any other revolution before.  Money comes and goes.  Revolutions do not.

It is tough to teach people until they truly want to learn. I have tried.  Most people just like to listen to the fud.  That is what they are used to.  That is what they are comfortable with.
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:08:16
My sentiments exactly.  I don't care how many dollars worth of bitcoin I have,  I only care about how much bitcoin I have.  
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:47:46
Does this mean the 3 copies of bitcoin will join forces to open up a pizza shop?
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:03:52
Very cool.  Glad to see bitcoinIn mainstream tv shows.
In the show "People of Earth" bitcoin is mentioned when one of the characters is asking his secretary about where all of his assets are.  Season 1, one of the later episodes I think.
@_date: 2018-07-04 13:32:24
So u spent 5 years doing nothing.  You could be one of the hands by now lol.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:08:23

This is why the dish ran away with the spoon.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:59:15
I think what your saying is the us dollar value of bitcoin is a side effect of what bitcoin truly is.  Money is usually attracted, not pursued.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:25:53
Not immune but easier to detect, less of an incentive to do so, and harder to get away with.  Transparent economy is coming.
