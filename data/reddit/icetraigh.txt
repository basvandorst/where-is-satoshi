Wow. Excuse the fuck out of me for thinking the largest exchange on the internet was any good. Normally, higher prices are analogous to more trust, better service, more uses, etc. I'm sorry for being the one dumb asshole who followed normal economic indicators and NOT reading your subreddit in making my decision. Thanks for setting me straight with your lightning wit. I wish I could be a bit-millionaire like you obviously are.

The sad thing is it's not my phrasing. I had a thread a while back where a few people told me they were glad I lost ~$300 because it would teach me a lesson.

You're right (not sarcasm, btw). I haven't lost it yet, so I shouldn't get too crappy over it. I just read this sub and get all down over all the comments about Gox and the lack of communication gox has.
Thanks for the optimism! I needed that! :)

I thought it was because of their stringent verification process. Like I said: naivety

All I have left is assumptions at this point... :(

Well hell, now I feel bad for yelling. :3
Thank you, sir!

Oh, neat! Thanks for the option!

Because internet know-it-alls would rather just say, "yeah they were dumb cuz I knew and they didn't" and the whole "if you did 30 seconds of research" meme, which is just hipster for, "why aren't you as smart as me??? 8)"
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:57:26
It's definitely a worthy option. Thanks!

In a word: naivety.  
  
At the time, Gox was worth $100 more per coin than Coinbase. Not knowing the issues Gox had, I went with them. 
Side note: I've been waiting a month now to get verified. I can't even get an automated response to my support queries anymore.
