Explain in a paragraph how any of those services would fix the volatility problem for me as merchant.
I ask you to do this because when I have talked about stuff in the past such as how decentralized exchanges are impossible because you can't 'decentralize' fiat, Bitcoiners would point me to solutions that claim to be 'decentralized exchanges' but do not actually decentralize fiat or otherwise solve the problem - Bitshares is actually one such response someone gave me.

Evolutionists don't give a shit about creationism? You need to learn to distinguish between caring about and agreeing with something.
I care about the [50-somethings who dumped their retirement savings into Bitcoin back in December 2013]( about [30/40-somethings who are destroying the lives of themselves and their family]( and about 20-somethings who are fluttering away not only their small savings but also their lives - do you know how much psychological damage Bitcoin has done to these people's lives? They check the prices everyday, because they are so fearful and stressed and depressed. This often has lasting consequences for the individual, and it takes years to psychologically come to grips with and recover from this kind of thing (it's just like gambling addiction).

Dude, I'm not here to make money
I'm here for the entertainment - Yes, I'll get rich, on the entertainment value.
That's like saying if you criticize and mock creationists as an evolutionist, you must be trying to make money or are trying to make gains off them. In a way, I'm just trying to help you deluded fucks.  That's why I told people to sell a year ago, when the price was a $1200 (I remember your username, not sure if you'd have seen my claim '$200 before $1241' though?)

Yep, and I'm a billionaire
Proof or GTFO
It's funny how every time I ask this question, some Bitcoiner almost always says 'I went all in at $5/BTC', yet when I ask for easy and simple proof (i.e. link to dust transaction on blockchain.info) they go silent.
The reality is, most people bought in at higher prices than where the price is currently at. That's just a fact. Most Bitcoiners are bagHODLers - and this is exacerbated by the fact that much of the money has already been cashed out by a handful of 'early adopters' in the form of Lamborghinis and mansions back in 2013.

See the response I just made to chingow

I have to admit, I did feel pretty euphoric when the ass dropped out of the price a few weeks ago and it went from $300 to $150 in a matter of hours. Partially it was because I predicted a year ago when the price was at ~$1200 that 'The price will go to $200 or less before ever reaching $1241 again'.
how's that dollar-cost averaging/'brief correction' going? LOL

Just as I expected
Ask for proof, and that immediately shuts up any claim about 'I went all in at $5/BTC' (LOL I said '$5' without even reading your post in which you said '$6')
