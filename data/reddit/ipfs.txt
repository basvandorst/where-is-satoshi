IPFS is a new hypermedia distribution protocol, addressed by content and identities. IPFS enables the creation of completely distributed applications. It aims to make the web faster, safer, and more open.

I've been following you and your work for quite a while. I wanted to promote IPFS to Bitcoin community. Now that you and your projects got the attention it needed, this account is not needed anymore.
I have no intention to present myself as you and will stop using this account after this comment. It felt natural to promote IPFS using account named ipfs, sorry if I made the wrong choice.
To make it clear, I am not jbenet and I'm in no way associated with IPFS or it's development. I am using IPFS as a major component for a project I've been working for and I'm very thankful for you and your time.
Thank you Juan Benet, IPFS will be huge!

The wealth comes from increased demand of Bitcoin and thus increasing the stash acquired by the nation.
First increase would come from people's need to get Bitcoin to pay taxes. This is what it means when a nation adopts a currency, it mandates that it's taxes are paid in this currency by law. This is why paper notes have higher value than their material value. This is how currencies have been given their value since the Romans.
Second increase would come from demand from other nations who want to commerce with this nation or it's people.
