Yeah it seems pretty criminal to me.  To manipulate a market price down for your own benefit, while hurting the rest of the participants in the market doesn't seem cool.  As a large holder of Bitcoin, it really hurts me and others if bad actors manipulate the price down. 
Basically they are robbing me of value.  Patrick Byrne CEO of overstock.com had issues with Goldman Sachs manipulating his stock price down through naked shorts as well.  Its not free market to manipulate and rob people.  Or to manipulate a market to protect the legacy scam system.  That's the opposite of free market.  That's a rigged market.  Unfortunately regulators usually become captured, which just allows immunity for the manipulator scammers.

I agree.  Likely it is because of shorting manipulation.  I am a libertarian and pretty much against regulation.  However if someone committs a fraud, if someone steals, or murders, or manipulates markets for their own ends to the detriment of everyone else, they should be brought to justice.  Most of these sketchy exchanges overseas have been faking data for a long time.  
Its obvious there is manipulation and fractional reserve shit going on.  Just look at this [coindesk article](  Exchanges are claiming to hold over 21 million bitcoins in total, even when only 13.5 million bitcoins currently exist.  Get your coins off the exchanges.  The more people who take ownership of their coins by holding their own private keys, the less able scammers are to manipulate the price.
