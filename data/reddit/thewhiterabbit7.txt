I just downloaded this. It's a beautiful UI. I saw that the fees are ridiculous. What do you think?

I don't understand this argument. So, you're saying people wouldn't spend their money on food, water, electricity, phones, houses? They just work and starve and have money in a bank account accumulating value? You're saying people wouldn't invest their money in new companies that could potentially make them more money?

What about the gold standard? Throughout most of the U.S history the dollar was backed by more than just the "faith" of the U.S government. Gold, silver, previous metals, bonds..
The money was sound. The U.S grew at exponential rates under this form of money. Look at how many people save their money in today's economy. A vast majority of Americans have less than 1K in savings. I would say that is not a good thing. Inflation is not all bad but not having sound money drives speculation. Low interest rates at close to 0 also massively drives over speculation. Ok, you can have your inflation but I want a guarantee for my money that it is worth something. People are more rational in their spending habits when their currency has an intrinsic value.

There are benefits to inflation. There are also massive benefits from sound money. The U.S dollar was backed by gold, precious metals, and/or bonds throughout most of it's history. The few times this was suspended was usually because of war efforts. The U.S dollar in fact became the world reserve currency because it was backed by gold and everyone else based their currency off of the dollar. Sure, I'm ok with a very low inflationary rate but I am not ok with the easy money and faulty monetary policy of the federal reserve. Hence Bitcoin has become so popular among savers. Inflation makes people spend wildly but sound money makes people spend rationally. Big difference.

But the dollar isn't a stock. Your point makes sense if we are comparing crypto to stocks but comparing it to currency makes Bitcoin seem risky... Which it is. 
Don't get me wrong. I am heavily invested in Bitcoin but the average Joe doesn't want their everyday currency to be this volatile.

That's a very scary thought

Sure. I guess it is all relative. If I was in Venezuela or parts of Africa, all of my "cash" would be in crypto. In the U.S, this doesn't make sense.

I agree mostly but the fluctuations are nominal unless we are talking about a developing nation. I definitely do trust Bitcoin more that Federal Reserve notes but I own a lot more federal reserve notes than Bitcoin because of simplicity of using it.
I think it would be a giant mistake to put all your money in 1 thing anyhow. I own stocks, crypto, gold, and cash. Protection is diversification.

Seriously, that show is the greatest disappointment in modern TV entertainment. It could've been the best show of all time. Breaking Bad will now rank as the best.

She's pretty awesome and super smart. I would love a person like this as U.S prez. Balanced, rational, and smart. She just gets it.

Without commenting about politics let me just say this "magic internet money" is good for the "poor." It allows financial resialiance. BTC is good. Continue on...

Yes, but he doesn't call himself a social Democrat. He calls himself a democratic socialist. Pretty different.

Nice. Thanks for the advice.

Yea! That'd be great! I would really appreciate it.

I don't doubt his sincerity. I don't doubt that he most likely a good man. I think he doesn't understand basic economics though. If you want our country to be more like the Scandanavian countries we are not far from it. If you say they are socialist, then you don't know what you are talking about.

For sure. I love Ethos. I own both. I think with how shitty coinbase is, Ethos will do extremely well but I think Blockport will do just as well because it's more centralized in Europe. It will become the coinbase of Europe. There's room for both. I own more BPT than ETHOS but I hope they totally disrupt the market. We need it.

I can see where you are coming from, however, since there is no authority in charge of Bitcoin they can not set an artificial interest rate. Truly, the price of everything in our economy right now is distorted because the Fed has set the price of the dollar aka the interest rate below market value. I have argued many times with Keynesians &amp; Krugmanites that the 2008 collapse would not have happened if interest rates were at 4% in the early 2000's but the Economic God of the Fed, Greenspan, needed to boost the economy. The once revered libertarian had finally turned into his worst nightmare. The Fed distorts the money supply and interest rate through quantitave easing and monetary policy which causes bigger booms and major busts. Add in the fact that the nation is in 21 trillion dollars worth of debt, regardless of who that debt belongs to, and the trust in the dollar will wane. Introduction... bitcoin.

The seeds of the sub prime meltdown in 2008 were sown back in 2001. The dot com recession caused a panic and the Fed lowered interest rates 11 times from 6.5% all the way down to 1.75% creating a flood of liquidity in the economy. As you said before this had not happened in the great depression but cheap money has consequences. When you make a decision to buy a house, what is the most important ingredient? The interest rate. If the interest rate is low, you will be more inclined to buy bigger &amp; better. It is a price signal.
Investors, and Americans with no job, no income, and no savings started buying up real estate. More home loans, more home buyers, and obviously more appreciation In home prices. In 2003, the Fed doubled down and cut interest rates yet again to 1%, the lowest in 45 years. In fact, this was below the rate of inflation. Appreciation rates for houses were close to 14%. So, you could borrow at 1% and have a house appreciate by 14%. Sub Prime borrowers were having a field day and so were investors. Then, to add gasoline to the fire, the SEC relaxed capital requirements for investment banks. Banks had never been so over leveraged in the history of the U.S. Do you see where this going? Once interest rates started to return back to normal you start to see the beginning of the end. In 2004 home ownership hit a sturation point and the Fed raised interest rates. In 2006 buyers began to default on their loans. In 2007 big lenders started filing bankruptcy, literally, at least one new one every month. The institution that "fixed" the 2001 recession also caused the 2008 crisis. 
"Many Americans probably believe that continuous boom and bust cycles are natural occurrences. The truth is we would not experience such dramatic economic swings were it not for monetary policies that distort real prices and encourage improper investment decisions. Boom and bust cycles are inevitable when government interventions confuse market participants."
