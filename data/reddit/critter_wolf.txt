As an economist, I'd tell you that the rational move is to forget about sunk costs and make a decision about what you want to do with your money now.
By that  I mean, say you bought 1BTC in December, don't think of it like you spent 20k then and you have 6k now. Make a decision based on the fact that you have 6k now, do you think Bitcoin is a good investment to put that 6k in to or would you rather use that 6k elsewhere? Nobody can make this decision for you, the more you research, the better informed a financial decision you can make.

The lightning network is mind blowing. I love what Elizabeth says about how bitcoin is typically seen as slow moving yet how quickly all of this is moving on top of the base layer.

Just a little feedback on your website, the words get a little difficult to read when they run in to the orange on the front page. Other than that, looks good! Congratulations

The difficulty to mine a block is unchanged by the halving. It's just the block reward which is cut in half.

Why did they use a news outlet as a source quoting an interview instead of just using the actual interview as a source?
Information gets distorted like in a game of Chinese whispers.

This is great! As a fellow rider, I'd love to know where you got this done
