I've been trying this for over a month now, but they won't respond to my emails. I've sent them numerous emails at this point and have yet to get anything other than an automated response.

Yeah, the funds are. And they even take my money from me, but then they cancel the transaction afterward and hold my money for days or weeks before returning it, which tends to cause a lot of problems.

Not true. I had about ten successful purchases from them before and now it seems like I've been completely blacklisted. Support isn't replying to my emails, won't respond to me here on Reddit, and there's nothing else I can do. They've cancelled my last seven purchase attempts and screwed me out of over $1,000 in profits and they don't even have the decency to respond to any of my emails. I can't verify myself either, because I can only try once every 24 hours and the questions don't even make sense. And I can't even get support to help me with that problem either.

And customer support is completely nonexistent. They've just stopped replying to my emails. And their site makes it impossible to get fully "verified". I was asked a list of insane questions about myself that not even I know the answer to. Like what city my social security card was printed in or who, out of a list of four people, I knew personally, when I didn't know any of them. And I failed the test ONCE, now I have to wait 24 hours for them to let me try to prove I'm me again, so they don't take all my money and hold it, while cancelling my orders.

I said none of the above, it was still wrong. I don't even know where they got those names.

I've looked, I can't really find anything else without huge fees. I figured might have some good suggestions.
