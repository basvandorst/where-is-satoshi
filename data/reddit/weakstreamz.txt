It’s like watching a train wreck but instead of passengers it’s my money on the train.

Hodl until you can’t hodl any longer, then hodl some more.

I can’t handle this anymore. I’m going into a self-induced coma. Wake me when it hits $50k, then again at $100k. After that wake me at $250k intervals until it’s over $1,000,000. If it crashes then you know what to do (pull the plug).

More bad news guys. Harvey Weinstein just revealed himself as the creator of bitcoin - Satoshi Nakamoto.

I don’t know what’s going on but I blame Coinbase.

Disappointed. I was expecting a "HODL" license plate. Anyone can *buy* bitcoin but it takes certain amount of courage, and perhaps stupidity, to hodl through the dizzying highs, terrifying lows, and creamy middles.
