Bakkt is Likely to Get Approval from the CFTC
One of Bakkt’s core services is to offer bitcoin futures contracts.
Of course, you can already buy and sell bitcoin futures contracts today. So what makes Bakkt’s bitcoin futures different?
Bakkt will back its bitcoin futures physically. That means they’re going to purchase bitcoin, remove it from the market, and store that bitcoin in their warehouse for the duration of the futures contracts.
These contracts will be one-day transactions. There will be no leverage or margin trading on them.
“IN MY OPINION,” EXPLAINS THE ANALYST ON THE IRG PODCAST LINKED ABOVE, “THIS INFORMATION IS REALLY BULLISH FOR THE MARKET, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES OUT.”
The IRG podcast also claimed that the contracts were likely going to receive approval from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
Bakkt Has Bold Plans for the Future
Bakkt’s first goal is to launch bitcoin futures contracts backed by physical bitcoin. These contracts should be launched by November 2018.
The IRG analyst explained what could happen next:
“SO IF NOVEMBER COMES ALONG AND BAKKT ROLLS OUT FUTURES AND THEY MEET THEIR TARGETS AND THEY HAVE SUCCESSFULLY ROLLED OUT ON THEIR PLATFORM, THEY HAVE A LOT MORE ON THEIR PLATE THAT’S COMING RIGHT AFTER. THAT IS WHY I THINK THAT BAKKT IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT THAN ETFS.”
Bakkt’s three largest partners are Microsoft, Starbucks, and Boston Consulting Group. Microsoft is rumored to be focusing on the technical side of the platform. Starbucks, however, may be the most intriguing member of the partnership.
Starbucks has led the way on technologies like mobile ordering and mobile payment technologies. Could the Starbucks partnership with Bakkt spur the mass adoption of cryptocurrency? If Starbucks isn’t interested in crypto, then why are they such a major partner with Bakkt? Could we be buying frappuccinos with crypto within the next year?
ICE is also the parent company of the New York Stock Exchange. Many of the proposed bitcoin ETFs have suggested listing their shares on NYSE Arca. As investors wait for bitcoin ETF approval, Bakkt could soon launch similar products on the New York Stock Exchange. ICE clearly sees potential in the future of crypto.
These are exciting times for the crypto community, and investors are starting to realize just how important the Bakkt news could be.
