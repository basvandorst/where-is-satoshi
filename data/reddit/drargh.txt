A better Bitcoin is better for every coin holder. Here's to more good news.

Fox News disregarding facts for a headline like Bitcoin is an African American.

Sometimes I check early days transactions from an old wallet and scream into a pillow given the price paid for absolutely pointless purchases at today's value.

At $10k Bitcoin I will see what that is in £ and punch the air or myself.

Don't they take 4 Days to ship..? May explain the delay..
Also. Don't they have an order status page?
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:37:29
Yeah I've wondered this too. How easy is it to cash out such a large amount? Does it depend much on location?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:53:54
Ask yourself. Do you think one day the price shall be higher than it is as of right this moment?
So far anybody who stood by the hodl is up on the deal.

Any amount of shitcoin before a date is too much shitcoin!

Smart plan. I just want to make sure I'm not walking blindly into chaos here..
There's conflicting takes on the situation all over right now. It's my own fault for reading as much, I reckon.

Talk of low fees and a boost to speed in transactions. Sometimes it does feel like propaganda coming from all sides. 
I can't be the only person who reads one in-depth comment or article on Bitcoin and somehow stumbles on a completely different viewpoint moments later.

You might be the first "Brit" I've ever come across who's used the term 'Limey'.
..and I know loads. Living in Britain and all.

Thanks. 
I read up and extracted all my BCH. Just going to leave/forget about it. Seems to be the sane thing to do.
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:22:36
Also a stellar way to lose weight.

Thank you. Yes I regularly add to it and accumulate slowly, so thanks again for your suggestion.
I think in the haze of alt-coins and hard fork discussion of late my ingrained yearn for panicking had me worrying I was moving my Bitcoins to a wallet which wasn't right for me, or even worse a fresh new alt-currency.

I'll be honest I'd only forgotten about it until you'd mentioned it there. Probably for the best.
