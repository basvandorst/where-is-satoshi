Dude, that one's a Bittrex wallet. I get your point, but you're choosing bad examples.

Blockfolio App. Enter your transaction details, as the price changes the app will show your Total Portfolio Value.

Yes the link goes to the intended article, several seconds later the ad pops up.

No it's something on your website. Nice try deflecting.

On mobile, I'm displayed with an ad that covers the entire screen without anyway to close it. I could send you a screenshot if this is your site and you are unaware this is happening.

Dude, I was only trying to help. Your time would be better spent getting those malicious ads off your website, they reflect negatively on you and your business.

Good idea. I quit May 6th, haven't redirected that cash anywhere yet.

Spammy link.

Holy shit. I never stated or implied that you were intentionally spamming your readers. I simply stated that the link leads to a spam ad. It is quite possible your website has been infected by malicious ads. I was only trying to help, I even tried to have this exchange in private messages, so that it doesn't cause you unnecessary embarassment. Why do you have to be such a dick about it?

You might want to send small test transactions back and forth, just to be sure you have everything set up correctly.
