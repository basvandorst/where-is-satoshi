You say you were able to view the financials of Mt. Gox? Are those available for public inspection? If not I would assume they must be..... I understand if you don't feel comfortable releasing them and it could land you in some hot water if you did it without permission, but can you contact Mark and see if he is willing to allow them to go public? This is a major issue and releasing the financials "could" help, especially if they indicate the substantial assets in lieu of liabilities.  


That sounds both hopeful and disheartening at the same time. If your willing to "bailout" the company it would seem that you see some value in it, unless you are truly just that awesome of a person, and willing to assume what sounds to be a very large debt burden. 
If you can't release the financials for public inspection, that's fine, but can you at least confirm the "Mt gox Crisis Strategy" doc was not from the company? 
Also any truth to this

Bruce I really appreciate your time in answering my questions you have been extraordinarily pleasant, and I know you're a really busy guy, but if I could beseech one final time. I disclosed that I'm a CPA already, and one of my "hobbies" is in studying fraud/ scandals (not saving this is necessarily one that's for the courts not me.) I should also disclose that I think bitcoin could be revolutionary, but my opinion is that it will ultimately doomed to fail, from repeated scandals, which will destroy investor confidence. 
1) Do you think this will finally provide the catalyst for bitcoin markets to self regulate, and develop industry best practices?
2) Are you aware if any organizational body has attempted to step up to the plate in order to say "These are the security procedures, accounting procedures, internal controls etc... if you meet these we will give you our stamp of approval"? Maybe Bitcoin foundation? 
3) As I said earlier I have a hobby of studying frauds. Even though each fraud or scandal unfolds in its own unique way, there is always one John Olson, Bethany McLean, Susan M. Wachter, et al ringing alarm bells months and sometimes years in advance. So my last question is this: Seeing as how Bitcoin assumes a great deal of personal responsibility, risk, and currently lack of transparency. What do you feel is the best way to instill more skepticism into the echo chamber that is occasional hallmark of the bitcoin society? 
Again thanks for your time you have been awesome, and I appreciate your insight. If you're unable to answer I understand as your time is valuable. As you know, its moments like this that will set the tone and direction of Bitcoin for years to come, do we hide our heads in the sand and pretend it didn't happen, or do we man up and face our problems head on? Only time will tell and until then I'll keep ringing my little bell over the cries of the masses. 
Again thank you.

First thanks very much for the reply


Totally understandable, now that gox is officially in bankruptcy, I guess they will come out. 


As I expected, which means either the valuation was to high, the risks to high, or the quick ratio was out of wack, or something more.... unusual was at work, again I guess we'll find out. 


Oh thank god,  there is a copy of what I was talking about. If that was an actual document prepared by the company it would not only admit guilt and attempted conspiracy, but the "assets/Liabilities" section, about gave me a seizure, I'm glad to hear as a CPA, that this document was not being circulated from official sources. 
again thank you for your time and I appreciate your original post attempting to shed light on the current situation... Bad times for everyone....

No, but it doesn't matter, that's what people will do. If people think 1 btc will be worth 10,000 why should they spend theirs? They will push you to spend yours. Bitcoin is doomed for this reason, among others.
