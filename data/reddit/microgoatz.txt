I have never tried it to be honest, but I think that's not a gdax thing, thats a btc network thing.
I can't see any reason it wouldn't work though. Test it with a small amount to confirm I guess
@_date: 2018-01-09 03:11:07
IIRC... PIA recommends that you pay them in btc and use a burner email when you sign up
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:13:44
Oh there may be another document. I signed up over a year ago so no idea if it's changed. If you want to deposit you can use either. Although I think CB takes a fee. You can use an ACH deposit from your bank to gdax for free. Takes like 4-5 business days. 
When you finally login to the gdax site, there will be a deposit bottom in the upper right area of the screen by the buy/sell tab. You open the deposit button and it asked you how you want to pay, and just select you method that way.
@_date: 2018-01-30 12:23:52
Coinbase to gdax is free. 
Out of gdax is also free.
Gdax eats the network fee... They are just way over paying right now. You transfer 1btc from gdax, you receive the same amount.
Coinbase to your wallet is not free. You transfer 1 btc from coinbase, you receive .99btc (only an example with made up numbers)
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:55:37
Can I pay with on BitConnect instead? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:22:57
Why would I open a channel for one transaction? To pay double the fees?
Or are you hoping I have a channel already open with Tom, who has a channel open with Marty, who has a channel open with Christina, who has a channel open with a hub, who maybe has a channel open with your kfc?
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:53:41
I'm a btc supporter personally, but this is all kinds of dumb.
"Making it require better computers to mine and run a node..."
You haven't been able to mine btc on a cpu for years. BCH hasn't changed that. 
I assume when you say better you mean HD space. I think IF they had full blocks it would require like 400GB a year. But, they don't even have close to full blocks, and if they did that means the adaption/use rate is at least 8 times more than it is now.
"...despite the theoretical  possible need to have service providers..."
LN will only be useful if you setup a channel with one party where you transact many times. Opening a channel for one transaction would incur two fees making it meaningless. 
LN requires you to lock funds into the channel. Only a large hub can afford to lock funds into many channels. How many channels can you afford to lock funds in? Finally, no one says it's not "cryptographically secure". The argument I see made most is that it allows the hub used to route transactions to censor them i.e. funds to a certain user/address can be blocked by the hub
You can call bch'ers shills. But you really need to acknowledge that there are valid criticisms to be made about LN.

If you have a coinbase account, it's the same login for gdax. They are the same company. Coinbase is basically a user interface that's easy/simplified.
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:08:47
Pretty sure they indicate that it takes 4-5 business days for funds to be available that way
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:15:20
Not sure how your getting it returned unless you're using RBF. Transactions should stay in the mempool for 2 weeks before being returned. If it's happened multiple times that means you've been trying for over a month? I imagine that you're seeing your fee to something like 5sat/byte, which is very unrealistic at this point in time
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:28:01
I'm not sure how the really can reject it back to you. Once it's broadcast to the mempool I think it can only be changed his RBF. Or returned of it sits there for 2 weeks. 
For the record, I'm very aware of the current fee problem, I just mistakenly assumed you were using an unreasonable fee

Yes, obviously btc, the coin with the immutable public record. Surely not one of those fancy prhvacy coins with an opaque block chain. This illicit activities surely want a record for all time!

Isn't this exactly what happened though? Those two coinbase address for unknown miners controlling like 80% of the hashrate, mining at a loss?
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:17:46
That's exactly how I got into Bitcoin. A small fraction at a time. That's why my DCA for my coins are around 2200. 
Please take all further stupidity to r/btc where you can buy one entire coin for like $250
@_date: 2017-08-26 23:22:01
Found out about btc a year and keeps coins on an exchange? Man you really haven't learned anything in that year. Rule one is don't store on an exchange.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:05:24
But eventually they will? When there is no block reward what will be the incentive for miners to mine?
I don't think that means high fees are good now or necessary now btw! I just mean eventually fees MUST get higher to keep miners doing their thing.
I think that's what the other person meant in securing the network.
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:13:55
Ah that too. I forgot about that angle of attack. Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:11:29
Literally the stupidest thing I've ever heard as well.
@_date: 2017-08-27 17:39:22
Fees "going to zero" tells me you have no idea how any of this works...
You need to understand how Bitcoin works. Fees are required to protect the network. 
No fees = free spam attacks = no network to use.

Bcc is considered an alt coin in this sub. Mods have dictated that all discussion occurs in the stickied thread, otherwise you risk the ��
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:10:10
I agree that fees are very high right now maybe even being manipulated for miner gain...
But what happens when the block reward ends? Yes, I know that's a century away (or less for bch) but the miners don't mine for free. The fees are what are supposed to provide an incentive for miners.
I'm the long run you need decent sized fees to make it worth a miners time and effort. Obviously I don't have an answer for what decent size is in this case. But the point remains, if fees are pennies, and there is no block reward, do you keep miners mining?

How is USD not better? Every transaction has been stored on the BTC block chain. It's called pseudo-anonymous for a reason.
Where is the list for USD transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:46:58
Bitcoin is not ruled by core. There is no one that dictates rewards or punishment. That's not how any of this works. The premise of btc is that miners act in their own self interest.
Why would btc fork to fix a bch problem? The times of "emergency" for bch as what causes this. It hurts that coin too. They already have a hard fork planned to fix it because it's hurting them
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:06:02
I think real argument goes something like.... 
The deal was reached with only miners, no devs. So if we went through with the S2X fork, then it looks like miners can set a precedent whenever they want and the community of users just has to follow along or jump ship.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:09:56
Since you don't seem to know what hyperinflation means...
Hyperinflation occurs when money supply increases rapidly.
Btc is mined at a fixed rate, that decreases by a factor of 2 roughly every 4 years, with a fixed maximum supply.
Btc is deflationary.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:52:51
Until you can buy everything you need with btc it doesn't matter. The price of milk at the store is the same price, regardless of the btc/USD ratio. If/when everyone moves to btc, then the price will still have the same relative cost, like .0000163648 or whatever. 
If your concerned that early investors stand to benefit from this more than late comers then idk what to tell you. Those early investors took a risk. If you want an equal distribution of wealth, not based on merit, then you are describing socialism.
Btc was not created to redistribute wealth
 It was created to remove the middle man who makes money off of your money. It was created to remove the ability for a person/entity to control your wealth and finances.
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:15:14
Yes. It would be hyperinflation for usd basically. Although the fed may not print more money in this case, the buying power of USD to to btc would decrease.
Even then, it's not really hyperinflation for usd since the buying power to basically all other goods and services would remain the same. It's all dependant on btc adoption and places you can use it. If it was usable everywhere, then it would definitely be a case of hyperinflation for the usd (or any Fiat you use to trade for btc)
@_date: 2018-11-11 15:33:40
Things we know:
(Assuming US here)
Gdp growth over 4%
Unemployment under 4%
FED raising interest rates because market is growing too fast
Market just corrected (greater than 10% dip). The US has had 36 correction between now and 1980. Only 10 have turned to bear markets
Things you believe:
Market is going to crash (when since you know it will happen)
Crypto bull run will return BTC to ~20k next year (Seems irresponsible for you to not take out a loan to guarantee over 100% returns)
Tldr you are reading a crystal ball and full of shit
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:45:57
That's exactly what I said. Btc going to 18k means it's buying power has increased. 
But yes, I am missing op's point. The reason btc was created was to remove power from traditional banking systems. Those systems operate on usd. If the buying power of USD goes down that means the btc experiment is working.
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:01:44
I also think you're forgetting that the fork occurred with community consensus. Vitalik didn't reach out and flip a switch. It was voted on.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:55:47
Why do you think Bitcoin is king though? It's a shit currency since it's deflationary (insert hodl meme)
It's a good store of value since the hash rate is so high... But the energy consumed mining leads me to believe it could never be the future of money.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:27:25
I wouldn't recommend 10$ only due to the fees. Coinbase is a business out for profit, as such they have a fee. And then to send to your wallet you need to pay a miner fee to have your transaction. Currently, low fee transactions are going through, but at times of high network use there is the potential for 5$ fees.
Between coinbase fee and the POTENTIAL of a high miner fee (although it's not right now) you may buy 10$ and only end up with the equivalent of 5$ by the time it's all done
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:48:17
How do you determine what's spam? As long as a transaction fee is paid (which it was), then there are only transactions.
Even if it was intentional, then the system can very easily be crippled. Imagine a gov with much deeper pockets for instance...
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:52:08
Yes, correlation not causation.
The entire system is designed to assist in bull runs when you think about it. It's easy to market buy btc to drive up the price since fiat-&gt;crypto is instant and offchain. To sell you have to move coins to an exchange(assuming you're not a day trader) and that takes time, limiting the supply/sell side. Seems likes it's very easy to cause fomo buying while the sellers have to trickle in
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:39:53
No. You're wrong. Hyperinflation is not another word for the same statement.
Hyperinflation occurs when value decreases. See Zimbabwe. Value of currency is decreasing.
We are arguing because you made a post to discuss a concern you had, but the entire premise is wrong.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:27:53
That's just stupid. Don't use a technical term, then say your not using the technical definition.
Hyperinflation occurs when supply increases rapidly and buying power decreases. That's it.
Btc going to 18k would mean it's buying power had increased. It's supply is fixed. 
From the white paper "Once a predetermined number of coins have enteredcirculation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflationfree."
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:56:11
Again, do you know the power consumption of a miner?
Now, slowly for you, what's the power used buy your phone to buy/sell/trade?
Here is the big finish... What's the ratio of those numbers? See how it's a value much larger than (1)?
That means to mine one BTC vs buy one BTC, you pay more to obtain the same total amount of coins. I can't go much slower for you.
@_date: 2017-09-29 18:26:32

@_date: 2017-09-30 00:02:05
Not sure. I don't use gemini. Coinbase is like intro to trading. They have an affiliate exchange called gdax. It will take some learning, but you can trade for free on gdax. You will still have miners fee to transfer to your wallet. But that cuts some fees out.
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:49:03
There could be an argument for network security too. I doubt a bank will want to invest the capital to have the same hash rate securing the network that btc has... 
Not saying they couldn't. I just assume that they would say (xxx)PH/s is enough.

Roughly every 4 years the block reward halves

No. Last I heard S2X does not have replay protection so any coins spent on one, are spent on the other. Bch was intended to be a fork. S2X is supposed to be "a protocol upgrade"

Since you don't seem to understand what Bitcoin is about...
"A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow onlinepayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through afinancial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the mainbenefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending."
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:25:26
What was the point of that? They trust their money to bank. Which is why I linked the first sentences of the white paper talking about removing trust.
If I need a watchtower for when I'm offline, I need to trust them. 
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:15:42
Isn't the point that without a watch tower, if you go offline, you have to trust the channel state when you reconnect? Watchtowers prevent the risk of the other party changing channel states while you're not there to witness it, correct?
So I guess you could choose to not use one if you're connected at all times?

You can't mine btc with gpus. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:14:48
Just wanted to point out..
Bch has the gensis block too. They have a shared history until the fork point. That's how token distribution worked, 1:1
Bch voting/consenus mechanism is also the same. The only argument here is on who controls the majority of those votes. Even then, if you accumulate enough hash power you haven't technically done anything wrong. Btc was created with the assumption that miners where greedy.

If you're using a gpu you can't mine btc. You need spell circuits called asic, to do it. Your gpu's hash power is insignificant. Hence the 0 balance
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:57:20
Just use GDAX. It's owned by the same people as coinbase, so you can use the same login/verification. And its a real exchange, not an app like coinbase. If you use Limit buys/sells there are no fees either
@_date: 2017-07-02 00:16:56
Pretty sure you don't understand how any of this works. They they could push an update out and force you to install it, then it's not really decentralized is it? The whole point of the current system is the users/miners vote, and no one is in control. You run what you support....
@_date: 2017-07-15 20:55:48
In the future, it might be smarter to buy in steps. Like if you bought 2.5 btc, set buy orders for .5 btc every $100 step for example (2300-&gt;2200-&gt;2100). It brings your average coin cost down. 
Maybe in the scheme of things it's only a few hundred bucks... but maybe your 2.5 btc could be 2.7btc of you bought that way

I have not tried low priority yet, but when I tried economic, it was still ~300 Satoshi/byte
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:56:43
Because it sets a precedent that miners can stall and then get what they want. Large blocks now are one thing. What about next time? What about when they are so large a normal person can't run a node? Sounds like centralization to me. 
Do you even pretend to think?
@_date: 2017-06-28 02:46:31
None. You can't gpu mine btc. You need special chips (ASIC). The issue is the encryption method, sha-256... If you want to mine, find a coin that uses scrypt as an encryption method. At least then it's possible to gpu mine.
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:53:50
I'm pretty sure segwit breaks ASICBoost, while segwit2x allows them to continue using... So, while I could be mistaken, you probably should not assume the miners are doing this for the good of btc...
