So basically the Krona became Japanese Yen in terms of value.

I bet that's their intention. What an insult to Bitcoin, seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-18 07:50:25
Is this legit? The bitcoins seem quite cheap and the poster seems to have spammed the site on another page, and that's the poster's history.

Imagine if you *could* Paypal someone Bitcoins!

Well yeah, I can't say I was particularly convinced that Silk Road meant noting but good for Bitcoin, but I didn't think it would lead to such a large rise in the price. However, I suppose that in reality Silk Road going down wasn't the only thing that lead to this.

That's terrible. You know, we always spend time critiquing the person who lost the money. Yes, you probably shouldn't have kept $70,000 worth of Bitcoins in the wallet, but what about the prick(s) that stole it? What absolute dickheads.
@_date: 2013-05-30 02:00:58
Fuck PayPal. I could say more, but fuck them. A hacky company that does not give a shit about your money or anything.

You're reaching here. C'mon. The intentions weren't deceitful or undermining to the original.
@_date: 2013-11-05 07:45:39
Yeah, I worded that incorrectly. What I meant is that it may have been wise to have a few wallets. Or different "types" of wallets, just to be safe. Then again, that could cause problems if it becomes difficult to remember all the different passwords. I'm not too sure. Likely I'll never have 70K worth of coins in my main wallet, so I probably don't have to worry as much.
I use bitcoin-qt as my wallet, and am happy with its capabilities and supposed security.

It's interesting, isn't it?
Who would have thought that Silk Road being taken out would have lead to such a QUICK change in the value of Bitcoins. Sure, maybe it was possible, but not at the severity or quickness as with what's happening now.
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:27:41
Now that was an interesting read.
@_date: 2013-11-08 08:08:34
Well of course. Cheese "Method Man" Wagstaff was all about the money.

Out of curiosity, are you from South Australia? Because only we do the Research Project, no other state does. If yes, why are you doing it in Term 3/4? When will you have time for the evaluation stage?
Anyway, I did the survey. Good luck with it.

Fucking assholes. Once again proving the already-known point that banks are one of the sources of evil. I may only have three bitcoins, but I do plan on spending them when more locations take them as currency.
Great system, too bad the banks have to go and fuck with it.
@_date: 2013-11-06 05:42:19
All time high *achieved*.
Incredible stuff.
@_date: 2013-05-25 02:05:28
So you see bitcoin as confusing?
Cool music video.
@_date: 2013-05-27 00:18:34
I will send them an email now. I really hope they adapt because it's much easier for me to donate to them via bitcoins.
