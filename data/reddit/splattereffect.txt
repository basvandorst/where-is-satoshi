okay, but the bits that I have are on changetip.com... it only seems to allow to send and recieve from social media sites and things... am I just wasting everyones time by trying to get this money from changetip? lol! I hope not.

okay... I won't do it, but is there any way to get the money quickly? I tried going to one of the sites that is suggested for changetip.com to exchange it, but they require verifacation of my identity and I do not have a scanner to be able to show who I am and whatnot... also, before it is suggested, no, we don't have a library in this dinky town that I am in and I have no friends or family near her that have anything that I can scan my identity papers (or ID) onto. lol! I just REALLY need this money to get the rest of my bill paid this month before people start taking actions and shutting things off and just... ~sigh~... Sorry... I tend to go off about my own stresses.... Um... any suggestions?

Actually, I already sold them. If I run across any more though, I will be sure to try to keep you in mind. (not that I will ever run across that many again since changetip is the only bitcoin thing that I have been dealing with and also do not get tips enough to actually get any bits. lol)

Okay, I understand that it is better to spend them while they are still in btc, but I really need the money so I can pay off a bill that is over due for this month. lol! I know it is not anyones problem but my own, but I just thought Id ask the fine people of this subreddit... I just really need help... :(

What is this "localbitcoins" that you speak of? Also, I understand about chargebacks now... had to do some thinking and you are right. Paypal is not the best to do with some random stranger... As I said to the other fine people of this sub though, I really need the money as soon as possible (if not sooner lol!) but, I guess I will just have to find another way unless you can tell me more about the thing that you mentioned...

okay. thank you. :)

how is paypal going to steal my money? and... do you have any other suggestions? I really need the money... :(

well, I have a cheap wal-mart smart phone, but the camera sucks on it and no, I don't have any friends around here with a better camera/smartphone with camera... I live in the middle of nowhere where no one seems to like technology. lol! Im sorry. I probably sound like I am just complaining over and over. Not meaning to... Im just kind of stressed. lol!

Wont work... None of the places around here allow people to pay for anything in btc... Unfortunate side effect of living in a small town in the middle of the United States... :(
