If you wish to avoid taxes you can use they them as currency as they were intend in one of the many bitcoin stores. You could try to find a local buyer and accept cash by posting on a classifieds type site like craigslist.

Not everyone is vested in the internet. They do not consider what implications it will have on their personal identity and our society's trajectory. Hopefully, this is a wake up call to the majority of people that these changes are happening and that they need to be aware of them to have some influence on this change; rather then just what the information/wealth privileged intend. At the very least it is a validation to the people who knew the capabilities of current technologies, but would be considered conspiracy theorists for mentioning it. Hopefully the interest it has garnered from people will create an incentive for the media to cover it more; because these networks rely on ratings like any other.
