Yeah - Slushpool. It was closer to $45/day before the latest batches of miners started running, decreasing my share and thus decreasing my payout. That $30 is averaged, so my actual daily might be closer to $20/day right now.

Regarding your bills and stuff, there's a dude that floats around here from time to time with a massive list of services that'll let you pay for everything from bills to groceries, and even get your paycheck in Bitcoin (I'm sure they transfer to your local currency and make the payments on your behalf, but it's still a way that you as the end user can be 100% in crypto).

Has been for me. Pool fee is 2% of the blocks, and they include transaction fees which not all pools do. They're also dedicated to BTC - don't even have an option to mine BCH. Outside of the holy war going on, that means that they continue supporting the BTC network whenever there's a massive, unexpected, shift in hash power like when the BCH EDA was freaking out. 
One of the coolest things with them is that they have polls and voting based on your hash power. So your voting power for which route the pool takes directly maps to your impact on the network.

80dB is too loud for a residential setting 24/7, but you can use normal soundproofing techniques to reduce it. Mine operates in a box in my garage, and the hum is down around 25dB. Stepping outside my garage in a spring day is loader than standing right next to the miner in the box.
**E**: And just a heads up, for each doubling of units add 3dB.  So one unit is 80dB, 2 is 83dB, 4 is 86dB, etc.

The beauty of electricity is that it's such a pure form of energy. Electricity, much like a honey badger, don't give a fuck how it's made.  Additionally, all the side effects of mining, namely heat and sound, can be minimized or made useful.
Case in point: I mine. My home's electricity is 100% supplied by nearby solar and wind farms (I volunteered for that, at a whopping &lt;$0.001/kWh). I'm also in Minnesota, so the 5000BTU a 1500w miner puts out is keeping my car warm overnight and my tools warm for when I need to work on something.  And for audio, basic soundproofing techniques work wonders - standing not 3 feet from it, it's 25dB, for a miner that operates at 80dB in open air.
I definitely agree massive Chinese mining farms probably aren't good for the environment, but that's more a function of China than it is of mining specifically.

r/bitcoinmining is a pretty informative community. Just use the search feature there because newbies ask a lot of redundant questions and it can start to annoy the locals.
Quick overview:
-There's no such thing as free power. The amount of electricity these things use, even if your landlord or parents or college cover utilities, they won't be happy about a $100+/month increase in their bills and you may get evicted.
-One S9 uses 1300-1500 watts, and a typical computer PSU (i.e. you can use 120v or 240v service, just need a PSU that supports it and outputs the necessary wattage on VGA power cables).
-In the US, there's a safety factor to include on continuous loads, so you effectively need a dedicated 120v 20 amp circuit per miner, or 240v 10a per miner (e.g. on 240v you can go for a 30a circuit and run 3 miners)
-Profitability is heavily dependent on network hash rate. I.e. as your percentage of the whole goes down, so does your percentage of the cut (assuming you mine with a pool to even out payouts and have a predictable ROI). Block value plays the biggest part day-to-day.  Difficulty adjustments appear to have an impact, but really that's just a stabilization value that indirectly represents overall network hash rate. 
-1500w = 5000BTU of heat being put out. I've been using mine to heat my central Minnesota garage (not as well a typical furnace, but enough to keep it ~40F above outside temperature).
-When looking at electrical costs, your bill might have a cost per kilowatt hour and a "fuel surcharge" or similar. Both need to be taken into account, and converted to $/kWh - one is generation, the other is grid maintenance. E.g. my base cost is only $0.07/kWh, but I have an additional surcharge that brings it up to $0.125/kWh

Mine runs $0.125/kWh.
If you look at your electric bill there might be two line items, one for usage and one for "fuel surcharge" or something like that - they may or may not be broken down by kWh, but both should be included in your cost. One is for generation, the other is for maintenance of the lines and stuff like that.

Depends on the duration you're looking at and what your intent is. Mine brings in 0.0023 BTC/day, and cost around 0.17BTC. Within 3 months the BTC generated will be more than the BTC cost, so for long term holding it'll be more beneficial to mine, but if you can't afford having that money tied up for that duration then it'll probably make more sense to buy and hold. 
Your expenses may vary from mine though, like if you need to get a circuit installed, or live in a warmer climate where you'd need to more actively cool it.

Not Op, but it looks like an Antminer S9. Approximately 1000kWh/month (specs are on shop.bitmain.com, take PSU efficiency and stuff like that into account for more accurate numbers), and mine has been averaging 0.002BTC or about $30/day income (before subtracting electric cost) over the past 45 days, mining against Slushpool.

Average per day for the past week is $17.81, largely due to the fact that Slushpool found an unusually low number of blocks yesterday and the 23rd.  They typically average closer to 16-17 blocks per day, but both of those days were closer to 10.  If either day had been more "normal" for them, it'd be well over $20/day.
I track every block Slush finds, and all the metrics they provide, including the price for the payout at the moment it's found.  You can see the dollar value generated per block typically only varies by a few cents each day, even on those days when they only found about half of their normal blocks.
Date|$ Value|Blocks|$ Value / Block|
22-Jan|$ 22.67|23|$ 0.99|
23-Jan|$ 11.76|13|$ 0.90|
24-Jan|$ 23.28|23|$ 1.01|

Reread my post, including the tense that clearly states I already made the payments and contributions, and hence know that it was, in fact, faster for me to copy/paste a Bitcoin address and amount than it was to punch in all my credit card info and deal with the potential phone call from my credit card's anti-fraud department... 
The payments confirmed by the time my stuff shipped out, and the charity had my contributions by the time they opened the next morning (although the amount was already in the mempool and available to see, just not confirmed yet).
While I agree the things you mention can be problems, that does not mean that my experiences are suddenly invalid or wrong just by virtue of not fitting your agenda. They just had different particulars that made Bitcoin the best option of those available in those situations. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:03:32
Not Op: 
Cost varies by batch. Mine cost $1900 when it was all said and done (miner, PSU, shipping, etc.) Super easy if you're using a pool - it was under 15 minutes from the moment I plugged it in until it was running against Slushpool.

Bitcoin is going to destroy banks like the internet destroyed telecom.
Banks exist for a reason - because there's a demand for their services, many of which are outside simply holding your money. The demand for those services doesn't magically disappear just because you can  control your own money more securely.  I get people's distrust in banks due to crashes and all that, but assuming that they can be wiped out is viewing it from way too high a level.

Over on r/bitcoinmining I think there are already a couple people that got kicked out of dorms for this.
Lots of people are seeing that their electric bill is covered by their parents, landlord, or whatever, and try to start mining farms just assuming that the provider won't notice a 1000kWh/month increase (plus their blind assumptions that their residential electric has safe capacity for it). 
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:48:49
Double walled box of 3/4" particle board, with ~2" denim insulation between them. The inner box has no solid contact with the outer box - only a couple flexible ducts, otherwise it's free floating in the insulation. I have an S9 with an EVGA 1600w G2 inside it, so the ducting is only 4" diameter with the S9's exhaust fan right against the exhaust duct (not a perfect seal, but good enough). ~15' of flexible insulated ducting for the intake, and ~3-4' of flexible insulated ducting on the exhaust for noise dampening, followed by ~15' of solid ducting.
I forget the exact dimensions off hand, but roughly 24" square by 30" long.
In order for your box to catch fire, outside of an electrical short or something, it'd have to be operating at over 230c, which is weeeeelllll past the point where any hardware will stop functioning.  As for the electrical risks, you've basically built a couple beefy computers so they're about the same as if you just had them running in a wooden desk.

Last I checked with my laser thermometer, the outer box was at the ambient garage temperature.
The inner box's outer surface is a little warmer but not a ton. Right this minute, ambient outdoor temperature is -0.5°F, ambient garage temperature is 27.5°F, and temperature in the box is 65.48°F. Hash boards on the miner are at 67°C, 65°C and 70°C.
If you're concerned about the machine's exhaust being enough to keep air flowing via the ducts, you can get inline duct fans too. It's just a fan mounted in a 6-12" section of ducting with a standard plug. Normally they're used with a temperature sensor to turn on when the heat or A/C come on, but you can also just plug it into a standard outlet and let it run 24/7.
Without knowing everything about your setup, I can't be sure, but you can probably get creative with shelving or something inside the box to help airflow too.

My transaction last night to my wallet took like 5.5 hours.  I was watching the receiving address for pending transactions (even if unconfirmed).

I'm actually going to be setting that up this weekend probably (assuming the shipping company estimate is accurate). My garage is unheated, so I'm putting a sound reducing box out there with ductwork, and putting a miner in it. I don't have solar directly, but I'm set up with my city to guarantee the equivalent of my usage is supplied to the grid from renewable sources too (city operates their own small power company, so they added a bunch of renewables to offset what they subcontract when citizens started showing interest).

While I agree that there's too much animosity on both sides, I'm not entirely sure that this sub is the more malicious of the two.  
The Big Bang Theory thread was an interesting little test bubble with the two groups, giving us a "in the wild" sample of how they behave without their respective sub's moderation.  The pro-BCH crowd was the first to jump in pushing an agenda as well as the first there using abrasive language meant to get a rise out of the "other side" (the screenshot for this thread was the first Bitcoin-related comment chain).  
I was there for most of it, and there were some level headed "do your own research" comments from people on both sides, but there were also about 400 comments of people from both sides just being antagonistic.  Both sides were equally represented, and both sides terribly represented their viewpoints.

For the same reason you think the government won't allow it, it will continue to.
Big finance is already getting into Bitcoin, or has strong plans to.  There's no way in hell they let any government restrict this new asset they want to play with.
Finance isn't about dollars or yen, it's about wealth.  Wealth can be measured in Bitcoin just as easily as it can be in USD.
Additionally, banking still has a place despite the anarchistic view some have in this sphere.  People don't magically stop needing loans or managed safes just because there's a new currency.

The way my tax guy talked about it, it would supposedly break down like this:
1. Mine 1 BTC
2. Claim 1 BTC @ current value as income
3. Wait some amount of time
4. Sell 1 BTC later
5. Claim capital gains on (1 BTC * (sale price - price when mined)) 
My understanding is that mining income is, as the term implies, counted as income, not unrealized capital gains.  Either that or your capital gains when you sell would be with a $0 cost basis.

We're two people on Reddit out of the entire population of Bitcoin users.  If the 500k users here is a roughly accurate sampling size, that's a little over 0.00003% of users.  If you take *only* the count of Coinbase users, at 13.3 million (as referenced [here]( then that's at least 46 people that are like minded and would most likely continue giving it value.
Interestingly, if people's faith in usability drops, and people drop out, then there's less stress on the network and usability goes back up, potentially balancing out at some non-zero value without even making any changes.

Back to well developed though.  SPAs are a thing these days, and don't require reloading or redrawing every asset on the page - just the pieces that are being reloaded.  You also have caching available every step of the way, and dozens of other technologies at your fingertips to optimize a website.

Yup, you transfer your BTC to the receiving address they give you, make sure your bank account is linked to them, sell, then transfer the money to your bank account.

As far as actually selling for USD, it'll depend on your strategy.  The Bear Whale just wanted to dump everything, so put in a sell order for all their coins at $300 USD.  Someone that wants to get out more elegantly might put in a few orders over a few days or weeks.

So there's two ways to mine:
1: Mine on your own.  Find a block, it's all yours - block reward and fees.  Don't find a block, you don't get anything.
2: Mine with a pool.  Anyone in the pool finds a block, you share the reward.  You don't find a block, doesn't matter, you still get a portion of the reward.  You do find a block, it goes to the pool which takes a cut (for operating costs, etc.), then shares the rest with everyone else.
With option 1, your payouts are larger, but less frequent.  With option 2, your payouts are smaller, but more regular (regularity varies by pool size, i.e. small pool = less frequent blocks = less frequent payout vs a larger pool).  On a long enough timeline, the pool will pay out a little less because of the pool's cut, but it's at the benefit of having regular predictable payouts.
In both cases, the key number for how frequently you get paid is your hash rate - how many computations your computer can do in a given amount of time.  E.g. an Antminer S9 is around 13.5Th/s (terahash per second).  The more hash power you have, the faster you can crunch the numbers, and the more likely you'll be to find a block.
In the case of using a pool, at least with Slush, they pay out based on your hash rate vs the pool's hash rate.  I.e. if you have that S9 at 13.5Th/s, and Slush's total hash rate is currently 1.636Eh/s =&gt; 1636Ph/s =&gt; 1,636,000Th/s then you get paid out at 13.5/1636000 = you get about 0.000825% of the reward each time the pool finds a block.  If they find a block that's worth 15BTC, then you'd get around 0.00012375BTC of that.  If you got, say, 100 S9s, then it'd be 0.0825%, or on a 15BTC block, 0.01237775BTC.
In Slush's case they have some extra math that goes into determining hash rates, to make it harder to cheat and less impactful if something bad happens.  I.e. if you mine against Slush for a few hours, and your internet connection dies right as the pool finds a block, you'll still get a payout since you submitted so much hash power leading up to the block.  Similarly, if you jump on the pool and they find a block 5 minutes later, you'll get less of a cut since you didn't really contribute much to the computing power of the pool leading up to finding the block.

No, it was about the value of Bitcoin as measured in USD. USD being inflationary will gradually make the dollar value of a Bitcoin increase, even if the real-world value of a Bitcoin is static.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:23:38
You might be lost here.  I was initially noting how they substantially increased the price, which then additionally caused people that didn't already hold BCH to buy more of it (whether they agree with the currency or not).
It has nothing to do with adoption, nothing to do with BTC or any other currency's fees.
Dollar amount change *does* matter, because, like it or not, we still represent *buying power* in common currencies, such as USD.  Yeah, in terms of investment, percentage change is more important; but when you're actually looking at cash flow in your accounts and trying to buy stuff then having huge volatility in buying power is absolutely terrible.  This situation works out for people that held from a while back because the S9's value in BCH might be similar to what it was; but it doesn't change the fact that relative to every non-currency asset in the world, the actual price of an S9 has doubled.  Don't forget what currencies actually are: a method of delayed, common-ground, bartering; so you don't have to work for a dairy, get paid in a dozen gallons of milk, then try to trade with everyone else for what you actually need and hope they want milk that day.
Also: I've never told anyone to dump BCH.  I generally tell them to be careful about the coin they're buying so they don't buy one they don't want due to naming confusion, but to ultimately look at all the options and figure out which aligns with their ideals and buy that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:04:02
I don't recall specifics or links off hand, but it was basically what happened the past day or two, just without the Coinbase trading hullabaloo in the middle.  I may have something wrong below, but you should be able to use it as a base to find more info if you're interested. 
Last day that the EDA* on BCH could kick in (and did) coincided with a BTC mining difficulty increase. Difficulty on BTC increased, BCH's EDA hit dramatically lowering the difficulty, making it ~~to is~~ so it was more profitable for miners to mine BCH until the EDA finished its spat. So miners switched, transaction times on BTC went crazy because a huge chunk of hash power disappeared suddenly, I think there may have been a pump somewhere in there, and it all self-resolved by Monday.
*The EDA - Emergency Difficulty Adjustment - was one of the changes BCH originally made when it forked off Bitcoin. It wound up making hash rate on both coins unstable though, because miners would mine BTC while it was profitable, then the EDA code would see the drastic reduction in BCH hash rate and trigger, causing miners to flip en masse to BCH until the EDA turned off and normalcy resumed. There was a BCH  fork to take it out/modify it, so this all happened the last time the EDA could kick in prior to that.

Yeah, definitely normal, I think 6% might even be within normal stock market swings.
I definitely understand the reaction though - $1000-$5000 swings feel massive because they're large numbers.  Just have to look at it in terms of percentages though to keep it in perspective.
I consider +/- 10% daily change to be completely normal and kinda boring, 20-30% changes are at the more extreme ends, but still fairly normal (just more exciting).  Touching on 30% changes generally seem to mean something's going on with the network or in the news (good or bad).

My only point with bringing up work is that it can be a decent way to meet people and pick up skills, which I wouldn't have had if I had become "Bitcoin rich" earlier.  I worked in what amounts to an apprenticeship for engineering, from that I learned 3d printing, design, machining, and other general manufacturing techniques; which I turned into being able to make stuff around the house and a respectable garage workshop (and valid, enjoyable, hobbies).

Wire transfer shouldn't have reset it, but the ACH 24 hour limit is 24 hours, not just next day, so that could be it.  (If you bought, say, last night at 7pm, you'd probably need to wait until today at 7pm for it to reset.)

It varies by country, region, etc.
Person-to-person can be risky, just like arranging any in-person trade on the internet (i.e. if you're selling a valuable on Craigslist, the chance that you show up and the person you're selling to has a gun but no money).  There are some ways you can make yourself safer, but I haven't done that sort of transaction so I don't want to speak to them too much on the off chance that I have outdated info or something.
Online reputable exchanges are generally decent, as are ATMs, although ATMs can have higher transaction fees (to cover the cost of keeping the ATM running).
Typically the process with an online exchange is: set up an account, verify your identity if required, link it to a bank account, transfer in BTC, sell BTC, transfer local currency money to the bank account.  The process of transfer, transact, transfer is just reversed if you're buying instead.

On any given day you'd have to go to extreme lengths, up to and including literally robbing a bank, to get to all of my Bitcoin.

It's typically recommended against leaving bitcoin (or any crypto) on an exchange, because it allows you to control the security.
If the exchange gets hacked, or closes down, or something similar, you can lose whatever you have on it.  If you use your own wallet, you control the firewall and antivirus software, you control physical access to it, and so on.  It doesn't remove the risk of loss, but it lets you personally control the attack vectors.
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:01:00
It's just reported as though you bought and sold with USD instead of straight crypto-to-crypto.  I.e. Report a trade of Bitcoin for Litecoin as a sale for Bitcoin at the current market rate, then a purchase of Litecoin at the current market rate (reported whenever you sell it, just keep track of the rate from when you purchased it so you have your cost basis on-hand at time of sale).
As far as loopholes, see a tax guy.  I can't think of anything legal to get around it.
As far as just straight up not reporting it, the thing that always comes to mind for me: Not even Al Capone could escape the IRS.  Do you really think you stand a chance?  Given the choice between paying up now, vs probably going to jail and still paying up later, I'd rather just pay now.

If you trust NiceHash now that they're back up, you can mine altcoins with a more regular computer and get paid in BTC.  NiceHash is less of a pool and more like a marketplace - miners "sell" their hashpower, and other users "buy" it, so the miners get whatever the users are paying, and the users dedicate the hash power they bought to mine whatever they desire.
Re: specialized equipment, there's some math that goes into it, but if you're flexible with setup then ultimately it depends on your electric costs for whether it'll pay out or not.  At $0.125 per kWh, my S9 running on Slush is looking at a 1-2 month ROI, bringing in around $40/day worth of BTC and costing around $4/day in electricity.  That would be expected to decrease over time from difficulty increases and additional miners joining the network.
**E**: I almost forgot, if you check out r/bitcoinmining you can get some info more in line with what you would plan to have.  Despite the name, people talk about mining other coins there too, like what I mentioned about using NiceHash with CPU or GPU mining.  There's not much of a wiki or sidebar or anything, but I'd still recommend using the search box since the sub tends to get flooded with repeated questions from newbies.

I'm not saying a dip right after buying in doesn't hurt - I started buying in at 1800, and it hurt when a couple weeks later it bounced off 3k and landed back under 2k (and then again when it bounced off 5k).
It's just an observation of historical trends.  If you're buying in at any point in time, and terribly worried about short term changes, you should zoom out and see the cycles that Bitcoin goes through, and understand that in the grand scheme of things an 8% drop is likely temporary pain.  Particularly when you consider the number of people that have been warning about a correction coming up for the last month.

What now?  Are you saying that the entire concept of cryptocurrencies was created by people that wanted to create and sell hardware for it... but they didn't bother starting to create and sell hardware for it until over 4 years later?
This is more like the cold war.  Every time the playing field is level, someone else throws a bundle of money at better weapons to give themselves an advantage again.  Bitcoin is just the oldest cryptocurrency, so its miner-vs-miner cold war has been raging the longest, leading it to reach total nuclear annihilation sooner.  Sure, the weapons manufacturers (ASIC manufacturers) benefit from it, but even before they existed people were just using sticks and stones (CPUs and GPUs) to beat eachother senseless (mine faster than the other guys).
I'm not particularly in love with the ASIC near-monopolies going on, but while they are definitely vultures swarming around the demand, they definitely didn't create the reason for the demand.

Additionally, there may be some people that had planned to sell at 11k that couldn't get the order in before the previous dip started. I'm surprised we didn't see it more at 10k, but the last few major walls have had a couple bounces before breaking through.

How many of us would have retired to sit on our asses and play video games all day, dying of a heart attack before 30?  
It can be fun to play "what-if", but ultimately I trust my past decisions.  Having millions of BTC right now would have changed my life, but it's arguable if it would have been "for the better" when looking at what's happened since 2010 when I first heard about it - I've gained a ton of work experience that I've transferred to hobbies, started a family, and made friends at work.  All things that wouldn't have happened if I retired at 25.
Plus, the crypto ecosystem wasn't exactly fleshed out back then.  If we're at "internet in the 90s" *now*, then back in 2010 we were still talking about baud rates and HTML didn't exist.  If it were as easy as it is now to get into it in 2010, it would have been stupid not to, but the risk and labor required were absolutely a limiting factor back then.

It's more that the value of a dollar changes over time, so even looking at the value of a Bitcoin as static (I.e. If you think it only has a value equivalent of 1USD today), it's relative dollar value will increase over time as the value of a dollar decreases.

It varies by exchange.  Looking at Coinbase at full verification linked to a bank account, the limit (for me) is $15k/week.  Jumping over to Gemini, my limit is $100,000/day via ACH, or unlimited via wire transfer.
Before anyone brings it up, GDAX might be closer to Gemini's limits; but GDAX isn't available in my area.  Despite the misconception that having a Coinbase account is all you need, GDAX is still locked out of some regions that Coinbase can operate in.

There will be no government to back it up if it fails.  There will be no bailout.  There shouldn't be.  But there will still be people that assign some value to it, therefore making it have a non-zero value, therefore making it impossible for it to drop to a 0 value as long as 2+ people still give it value.

As far as scheduling, whatever you want to do should be fine. The only issue with something like $10k on a schedule is that it starts to look like money laundering so your bank account might get locked until you talk to someone in Customer Service (or possibly law enforcement depending on how things go) and get them up to speed.
As far as taxes, they're calculated based on when you bought and sold the crypto, not when you transfer the money to your bank account.
As far as techniques, for this amount it's probably worth it to talk to a tax professional. Even if they don't know crypto, for the purposes of taxes it's effectively treated like stock, including long vs short term capital gains and all that.  Worst case, you're looking at short term capital gains on all of it, which is basically taxed as normal income (I.e. Added to your salary for the year).  If you have the original purchase info, then you'd only be taxed on the gains, and long vs short term capital gains will be based on how long since you bought it.

Exactly. I've paid plenty of "expedite fees" because a manufacturing line was down waiting on a part, or a project timeline was unexpectedly tightened and we needed the supplier to do whatever it took to get their part done faster.
How the supplier chooses to apply it is their business. Normally it was just paid to their employees + overhead to work a little overtime dedicated to our job, but occasionally they'd work with their other customers to bump around delivery dates and prioritize ours.
I get where it could be a little blurred, since he's pocketing the money, but it's from his own small business where he pockets the money as normal practice. If your mechanic worked for a corporation and you paid him specifically $100 to get your job done faster, that would be a bribe; but as it is you just paid his company $100 for expedited service.

I opened an Ally bank account specifically for crypto stuff though. All online, all automated, averages around 10-30 minutes to open the account and link it to crypto exchanges (based on my experience and some people I've helped). I've never seen a statement that Ally is guaranteed to be OK with crypto, but they are generally regarded as one of the "safe" ones. At the very least, having an extra account at a "known safe" bank act as a filter between your crypto and normal accounts makes it so if something does go screwy it doesn't affect your normal day-to-day life.

It's less "can't we all just get along", and more "can you stop damaging the brand and turning newbies off of it". Until the split, BTC was genuinely more pleasant then Bitcoin for this reason and undoubtedly sniped a fair number of newbies away as a result.

Normally I move them out as soon as the transaction settles, but you don't really *need* to with amounts that you're OK losing.  For dollar cost averaging, I'll let a few transactions stack up and move them at once (since they're smaller amounts). 
The risk is that if your account gets shut down or hacked or something, you lose the coins on it and dealing with support to get them back can be a bear (and isn't a guarantee). Having them in a wallet you control means there's no risk of you getting banned from them (there are still ways to lose your coins, but you can mitigate those risks more). If you think of the exchanges like a bank, your assets can be frozen for varying reasons, but even if that happens, the cash in the wallet in your pocket is still usable - similar concept here, including risks (i.e. while the cash in your wallet can't be frozen from use that doesn't mean you can't be mugged and lose it).
For holding them, you need a wallet. Depending on your holding plan, that can be a piece of software on your computer, a hardware dongle, or even a piece of paper. I personally use a Trezor (hardware wallet), with a copy of the recovery seed in safes at two different buildings.

Chances are you won't get any real answers on quantity (generally a bad idea to share that info), but I was interested in the holding breakdown a while back and someone shared [this](  (Basically, of roughly 10.5 million addresses at the time of the article, only 445,000 had a balance above 1 BTC.)

Seems like the other responses are responding to the rest of your comment, but no one answered the question yet.
No matter what or why OP posted, the response that they completely failed to hide their transaction (and by extension, address(es)) is a valid security concern from a user perspective.  They effectively just gave us a social media account (even though Reddit is semi-anonymous, enough data can likely be pieced together to figure out identity on a long enough timeline), and at least one BTC address linked to their identity (either sender or receiver - even if the receiver is a friend as they said that's someone linked to the user that we now have the address of).
Given that the block chain is a public ledger of all BTC moving around the network, it starts to become susceptible to analytics.  With as much profiling as can be done via social media, imagine if Facebook or Google had all of your banking information, not just who you paid, but who they paid, and so on.  Given that OP posted enough of their transaction information to reveal addresses, I highly doubt they've tumbled their BTC too, making them even less anonymous/secure.
Regardless of technology changes and where you stand on them, proper security is still a big deal.

Honestly, I never used a software wallet - just went straight to hardware. From a quick search, wallets like Electrum don't (or at least have an option to not) download the whole blockchain.

Use more than one exchange.  If you're doing ACH transfers, Gemini is pretty good too.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:52:39
It varies a bit by wallet.  Trezor has their supported currencies listed [here](  Ledger's are listed [here](
In some cases, you might bounce to a different wallet software to interact with a given coin, but the device still handles the transaction signing and security - it's basically just using a different user interface but still secured by the device.
In case you don't know too: wallets don't store the actual coins, they store the keys to get to those coins.  Anyone can see what's in an address, but only someone with the keys can actually send transactions from that address - like a mail slot on a glass door, you can see how much mail is piled up, and slip more mail in; but only the person with the house keys can get inside to open/forward that mail.  The security of a hardware wallet comes from the fact that those keys are never revealed to the computer you use to make transactions - the computer forwards transaction info to the device to be signed, and the device only sends the signed transaction back.  Software and hardware wallets have different pros, cons, and risk levels, so it's mostly up to you to determine how much risk you're OK with and act accordingly.
Personally, for only $100, I just jumped on a hardware wallet right away and never bothered with software wallets.  Backups are stored in fireproof containers in multiple locations, etc., all the normal physical security stuff.

His way works if you don't have the extra capital to buy the item and some BTC, my way works if you do.

I use an intermediary bank to limit risk of my actual account closing (my actual bank probably wouldn't - but it's just a precaution that was worth the risk).  Transfer funds + a little padding from main bank to intermediary, then buy via ACH from intermediary.  The padding is just to maintain a balance with the intermediary so they don't close it due to low usage.
I am in the US, but as far as I know that technique should work in the EU too.
@_date: 2017-08-23 19:05:21
It's considered income, just like any other incoming dollar values - like investing in a stock/Bitcoin, it can crash to 0 (i.e. not win) or take off to obscene numbers (although much less likely), yielding what amounts to a return-on-investment, which is taxed as income when you deposit to your bank account.  (If I buy $10 of BTC, and the price rises to $12 when I sell, I get taxed on that "income" of $2.)
I wouldn't be surprised if you could hire a tax dude to find every possible way to maximize what you keep just like people that make $350m/year salary - it just probably doesn't happen as much because the type of person to play the lotto isn't typically the type of person that runs into that level of accountant very often.

There's no reason he couldn't, it's just a mental trick to invest in more BTC. It's almost like I do understand but there are multiple ways to do things with slight variations in output... 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:07:45
Wheee, brain dump.
Most of what I say below will apply to other cryptocurrencies, but since we're in the Bitcoin sub I'm just referring to Bitcoin - other cryptos have different features, but the core functionality is similar.  This is also fairly high level (ELI5-ish), so don't necessarily take it as investment advice or an absolute reflection of the network, but it can get you started.
It's effectively like trading in a foreign currency.  As economies do different things, the value of it relative to your local currency will fluctuate. The biggest difference here with BTC is that it isn't backed by a country, it's backed by a decentralized network that processes and confirms transactions - effectively a worldwide currency with its own economy.  Similar to a normal currency, it can also be used to pay for things - I've actually purchased goods with it because it was easier than sending a check or working through a credit card form.  It even uses online exchanges to change your currency to/from Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies).  
Also, since it's a general point of confusion, you don't need to buy a full BTC to invest in it.  You can purchase fractions of a BTC, down to the hundred-millionth of a BTC.  Most people don't jump right in to buying a full bitcoin.
Since it's still relatively new, and seems pretty promising in terms of its features, people here tend to believe that BTC value will significantly increase in the long term - it's all crystal ball guess work, but the general feel is that $10k-100k/coin is likely on a long enough timeline.  The most realistic estimates I've seen so far are loosely $5k by end of year, $10k in about 5 years, and $100k in 10-20 years - but, again, guess work with lots of variables.  Besides the capabilities of the currency, most of the hope around it going up is the fact that major institutional investors haven't really started investing in it yet - we're effectively still in startup investment phases, proving that it's viable before big banks and places like Fidelity start buying into it, which will increase the value.  Some financial advisers are also starting to recommend it, like CNBC clips have been popping up a bunch recently.
As far as timing and what's going on specifically right now vs a few weeks/months ago, there was a lot of network uncertainty regarding some technical changes.  That recently got settled in a survival-of-the-fittest style split ("fork") - with the change splitting off to its own network.  It's a cool setup, since if the network can't come to agreement on something, it can just split off a branch and actually give it a try to see which option works best.  As an investor, that works similar to a stock split - you start off with one share, and wind up with two (1 BTC, and 1 BCH in this case).
Most of the involvement from people here is in terms of just investing or using it for payments, but you can also setup a computer to verify transactions (no monetary benefit, just helps the network), and even set up a device to process transactions ("mine" Bitcoin) - although that typically isn't profitable in the consumer space these days due to energy and equipment costs.
My involvement specifically is just on the investment side, although I think the backing technology is cool and try to stay read up on it (I'm a software dude, using cryptography to create a self-regulating currency is just awesome).  My experience from the US has been that it's pretty easy, but you should still take precautions, and don't expect to go from nothing to moving money around overnight.  You still need to follow local regulations, tax laws, etc. and those rules include some steps that can take a couple days to process.  I think my initial "decide to invest" to "actually purchasing some BTC" timeframe was around 3-4 business days, but now that it's all set I can pretty much purchase at the drop of a hat.
Definitely ask around here if you want to know more.  There's some occasional chatter about things like bank accounts getting closed or other things you might not expect, but if you just pay attention, do your research, and take precautions it should be pretty safe.

I wasn't talking about "Bitcoin" the cryptocurrency as the brand to be damaged.  I was talking about this specific sub (hence noting Bitcoin and BTC as separate entitites - which isn't true for the cryptocurrency), which has numerous knockoffs and detractors that popped up.  I'm not even talking about the mods or core team - from what I've seen they seem to be good at what they do!
What I *am* saying is that people being assholes and using the same click-baity, "everyone's a paid shill!", argument tactics you see from places like r/btc to try to sway newbies are pushing people *away from* r/bitcoin and *to* r/btc and the likes - thereby damaging the brand *of r/bitcoin*.  **That's what needs to stop!**
Like it or not, this subreddit - while not an official brand of Bitcoin the cryptocurrency - *is* a brand for a community built *around* Bitcoin, including the ideals that community holds regarding the future of Bitcoin the cryptocurrency.  Every time someone decides to be a jerkoff, or spew random conspiracy theories, or dismissively calling someone a shill, that's one more potential user being turned off the r/bitcoin brand and ideals.  That's one more person possibly stepping off the "team" and turning to the "other guys".

I know this sub likes to beat on US banks, but I'm pretty sure you just use shitty banks. 
I've done 2x 5 figure ach transfers from my local bank to a brand new account at a different bank, no fee, no questions, from the comfort of my home office and without picking up the phone. I forget the exact timeline, but it was maaaaybe 2-3 days (as fast as the ACH system allows - which is a regulated, not bank-controlled, speed).  This is all in the US too.
I *do* prefer bitcoin to fiat long-term, but all the troubles I read about banks are still there in bitcoin right now (right down to transaction fees - sure, you can do a 0-fee transaction, but that has a somewhat unknown delay, and the exchanges still charge fees just to get into btc).

Gemini doesn't allow credit card purchases. It also has higher sell limits, and higher weekly limits overall but more limited per day. E.g. (random numbers) if Coinbase allows $2k of purchases per week, Gemini might allow $500 per day - over the week that's an extra $1500 you can purchase with Gemini, but if you haven't bought in a week you can buy $2k today through Coinbase.  Gemini also seems to have much higher withdrawal limits, including wire transfers with no limit, although Coinbase *might* too and it's just not available for me.  Gemini's order placement is more flexible too - allowing different types of orders, where Coinbase is just a "purchase this amount right now". That flexibility does come at the cost of Gemini being a bit more intimidating to a new user though.
Both of them have waiting periods on ACH backed purchases (ACH has regulated speeds for money transfer, so the coins will be set aside right away as pending, but not fully credited to your wallet until the ACH transfer finishes).  Both have similar ID requirements in the US too. Linking them to bank accounts is pretty much identical too. 
I found both to be pretty smooth and straight forward as a new user, although Coinbase is a little more streamlined for it. I predominantly use Coinbase for the ease of use, but occasionally switch to Gemini if I need the extra features or want to transact more than the limit wills allow me to through one. 
Don't trust either (or any exchange) to store your coins long term though.

Yes it does. I have "thousands of dollars" of purchases in my transaction history to prove it, and the fact that I've never carried a USD balance on Coinbase.
What you did, based on what you wrote, was expected Wells Fargo to front you the total to send to Coinbase before Wells Fargo even actually had the money.  ACH transfers aren't immediate, just in laymen's terms, look at sending a letter.
If you call someone and tell them to send a document, it'll take a few days to get there but you know it's coming. *UNLESS* they send a document stating "at the time of request, we did not have the document requested". Based on what you wrote, you sent your brokerage account a request to send Wells Fargo a letter, then told Wells Fargo to send a letter based on the one they were expecting to Coinbase - *before the one they were expecting arrived for them to base it off of*.
What Coinbase is doing is setting aside the coins *while the transaction is processing*. If you do something stupid, like, say withdrawing from an account that doesn't have enough funds, of course the transfer will be blocked *because your bank will say funds weren't available to transfer to Coinbase at the time of request*.

It seems like just buying a house isn't a big deal, but it's bigger than you expect. I have a friend that came into some money - just enough to pay off all debts, mortgage included. It was like getting a $20k/yr raise, and now they're popping out babies left and right, and generally much happier and care-free. 
It's not retire-at-30 money, but eliminating the single largest expense on your checkbook is still pretty life changing and something most people only dream of - regardless of the local cost of living.

I just noted how it's super sketchy to have two people post the exact same message in support of something, and how that duplication of the message is what makes the tweets in the link look like they were potentially paid for.

I genuinely hope you can pull it off - more startups and exchanges are always better - but this reads like typical "idea guy"-level planning.  There's a lot of legal stuff around finance, and a lot of hidden stuff with running a business.  
Just off-hand, from seeing paypal only, you reeeeaaaallly need to be working on more backup plans than you have, for all aspects of the business, not just the technical "created the code" side. Preferably things that are running simultaneously to your "ideal" workflow for a given user.

Coinbase also allows credit card for buys, but with lower weekly $ limits. (Once you give them all the requested info though, the weekly CC limit is $2k, and can go higher after a waiting period.) 
Also, for bank accounts I'd recommend opening a buffer account at a known-good bank. Some banks get antsy when they see transactions going to/from bitcoin exchanges, and will close people's accounts. Transferring to an intermediary account at a bank that's known to be OK with bitcoin is just a way to help keep your primary account safe.
@_date: 2017-08-30 01:10:57
Depending on the exchange, the BTC purchase is locked in at the time of order, the coins are just frozen until the transfer clears (i.e. you purchase at the current price, but can't sell/move them until the bank transfer finishes).
Coinbase does it that way, I'm sure others do too but I haven't monitored them enough to be sure.

Screenshot of my current watch face.
Because you can have more than one piece of data on a ~2" diameter circle.
**E** Full breakdown of data:
Time, date, BTC price (obviously).
My S9's average chip temperature, current hash rate (I have it underclocked to mitigate heat right now), plus an indicator of intake and exhaust air temperature.
Current temperature value, numeric phone and watch battery, plus step count, and heart rate (I wasn't wearing it the moment of the screenshot).
The gradient pink -&gt; yellow -&gt; green circle is showing watch and phone battery life too, just easier to quickly recognize.
Upper right bars showing today's weather, plus the next 3 days. Current temperature indicated by the red dash, with key temperature ticks at 32, 50, 70, and 100F.
Left semi circle is phone media volume - fills green as the volume reaches max.
Made with:
-Watch face: WatchMaker
-Data gathering: Tasker mostly, hitting CoinMarketCap, and an API I built for my S9's info that  links up to some temperature recorders I have at home and an always-on computer that pings the S9's built in API.
@_date: 2018-06-04 07:24:33
78°C is the average chip temperature of the S9 (why it's in the S9 icon).
61°F is the current outdoor temperature.
I'm tempted to display the intake and exhaust temperatures too, but I'm doing a trial to see which format I like better. Colors change based on some set ranges.

\*looks at 15k limit in coinbase\*
About that... 
**Edit**: To be clear, the exchange isn't just floating you $15k.  They have $15k worth of coins in their reserves, they make your account show as though you have it, but you don't actually have any control over those coins until the transaction comes through.  If the transaction fails for some reason, *poof* the coins are removed from your account. (I.e. as previously stated, the coins are frozen in your account.)

The beauty of smart watches is that if I'm going into a situation that demands a pretty thing on my wrist, I can swap faces with the flick of a finger.

If I needed both, I could make this one pretty too, but limiting the graphics makes it easier to read at a glance.
Ultimately, it's a response to the Hodlex post though, where it was full of empty space and didn't even function as a watch. If it were targeted for mass adoption, the happy point is somewhere in between.

Yeah, it was causing some confusion in this sub because everyone was looking at different exchanges and different countries as it was hitting $10k USD.  Each exchange is effectively its own little market, with its own unique price.  Some people actually game those differences ([arbitrage](
Head on over to r/bitcoinmining for info.  That said, assuming no other power usage, no cooling needed (unlikely), etc. you could be looking at up to 33 Antminer S9's with 50kW (1500 watts per miner running on 220V).  There are other miners though, and a lot more to profitability calculations.  You'd need to include maintenance costs for your solar array, cost of running dedicated electrical circuits (recommended is 220v @ 30 A, 2-3 S9s / circuit; you can also fit an S9 on a 120V 20A circuit, but it's less efficient and tops out at 1200W with the manufacturer's PSU), sound (an S9 outputs 85db, about as loud as a hair dryer, 24/7), cooling (1500 watts puts out 5000 BTU of heat that you'd need to move away or cool somehow to keep them from overheating), and so forth.  
As mentioned though, there are other miners that can use less (or more) electricity, including some alt coins I think that can still be mined with GPUs and turn a profit.  Do some searches on r/bitcoinmining though - lots of newbies recently (myself included), so a ton of the common questions have been asked and answered recently.
For me personally, I'm setting up an S9 in a soundproof box with ductwork and a 120V 20A circuit to heat my garage.  Normally that wouldn't be a good idea at my electrical cost, but it'll be a little cheaper (and maybe turn a profit) vs traditional alternatives for my specific situation.

I know they generally seem to follow BTC, but that's obviously broken in the current cycle.  I definitely don't feel as "off" about them as I do BTC.  
They've both been pretty stable by comparison while BTC has been doing all this, and I expect that to continue until whatever BTC is doing breaks.  At that point, I expect they'll increase unless BTC's rocket decides to crash in the Mariana Trench (or something similarly crazy and market-defining).

I always forget about the heat when looking at mining.  This is tempting though.
I live in Minnesota and have an unheated garage with a workshop in it.  It tends to get hard to use when the ambient temperature is sub-zero for weeks because, even with a portable propane heater for my comfort, the tools can be too cold to touch without gloves (I've had [this problem]( once or twice, except my fingers instead of my tongue).  Even operating at a loss based on electric costs, for 6 months a year it might still be able to save money vs installation and usage costs for running a natural gas line and a "real" heater.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:39:35
A miner is just a space heater with a really complex heating element, and I need a space heater in a currently unheated space.  Any value - high or low - it brings in will make it cheaper than running a normal heater for my situation, even taking hardware and installation costs into account.

I'm treating it as an "early retirement" fund.  I have all my traditional retirement stuff on track, so I'm "safe" for a normal retirement, and crypto just gets my extra spending cash.  I use it for its intended purpose as appropriate and replace what I spend, otherwise it just sits there gaining value.
Since it is spending cash and it can move quickly, if I have an emergency I can pull it, but otherwise the bulk of my value in it is long term pending value.  If John McAfee winds up being right, "long term" might only be 3 years.
At this point, unless something catastrophic happens to the network, I'll never go all-out though.  Hodler for life to at least some extent.

If GDAX is allowed in your region, it should have options to set up more advanced orders using your Coinbase credentials; otherwise Gemini and Kraken can both do it too.
For Coinbase, at least on my account, you don't need to "deposit" money to make a purchase - you make the purchase, it locks in the price and quantity, then just unlocks the BTC for you after the bank transfer clears 3-5 days later.  For Gemini and Kraken, you need to do a bank transfer first, but they both allow wire transfers (as does GDAX I think) which typically complete within 24 hours (pending your banks processes).
Either way, figure out what you expect it to drop down to, then set a "limit buy" order for that price at however many BTC you want.  If/when it drops that low, the exchange will execute the order automatically assuming the funds are available.
Also for Coinbase, if you go through all the verifications, including one or two waiting periods, you can get up to $5000 buy limits for credit card (again, looking at my account; it might vary based on your region or something).

It takes a bit of work, but you can do it with existing miners.  1500 watts (i.e. an S9) = 5000 BTU/hr.
Only really potentially profitable in colder climates though, otherwise you'd need to run your A/C more during summer to offset the heat they generate, which would significantly increase the cost.  Could maybe pull off some sort of air-to-air exchanger setup to optimize it though.

I've been bouncing around which pool I'd use when mine gets here in January, and this pretty well solves that question.
People can talk about decentralization and maximizing profit and everything, but I was already planning to manually switch to BTC only during times of network strain - if slush does that for me then it's one less thing I need to worry about.
I have no problems mining whatever during normal times, but during extenuating circumstances I'd rather manually set  it to help whichever network is having problems make it to the next difficulty adjustment so it can recover as intended.

It seems like the other answers are a little off-mark or not quite inclusive. Answering in reverse order:
Latest info I've seen is that B2X won't have replay protection. Bitcoin Cash did.
As far as what replay protection and a replay attack are:
As you may or may not know, the blockchain is effectively a public ledger of transactions.  That ledger has certain rules for how a transaction gets added to it, as well as giving it other attributes - effectively providing the features of the coin and making sure transactions that get recorded are actually for that ledger.
At that point, a fork is effectively making a photocopy of the ledger up to the moment, and tweaking those rules: now you have two ledgers with the same history, but different transactions going forward.
Replay protection then, is tweaking the rules on the forked ledger (the one that took a photocopy of the other) such that future transactions on the other ledger can't be copied to the new one, and vice versa. A replay attack is when a fork *doesn't* have that protection, and a malicious actor takes advantage of that lack of protection to copy transactions from one ledger to the other.
I.e. I have 1 ACoin, and someone forks off to make BCoin, giving me 1 of each. Without replay protection, if I send my 1BCoin to your address, you could then replay that transaction on the ACoin ledger, taking my ACoin too. What's worse, you could see Bill Gates send 1 BCoin to Tim Cook, then replay it to send 1 ACoin from Bill to Tim too - despite you not being involved in the transaction.  Now Bill's out 1 ACoin that he never intended to send.  With replay protection,  that can't happen.
In the interest of keeping it to laymen's terms I'm sure that overview could be ripped apart at a technical level, but should give you a decent idea of the methods and risk associated.  Also there are some techniques that can successfully thwart replay attacks, but as noted by someone else you just need to wait and see what tutorials come out after the fork.

Divisible to 8 decimal places. A Satoshi, what they're referring to, is the minimum amount of bitcoin you can transact.
As it stands, if 1 Satoshi = $1, then $1 would be the minimum transaction value. Technically, if that happened and there were a need for further divisions, the software could be updated to allow more decimal places - it just isn't like that yet.

Since you forgot the beginning of the conversation - literally the comment I replied to:


My comment about feeling "dirty" was a joking comment about buying BCH solely to make one purchase.  As far as transactions are concerned I basically paid with a credit card - my BCH balance was the same before and after the purchase, I just had to purchase through the BCH network instead of through PayPal or Visa or whatever.  If you'd have actually read what I said, you'd see that I never once stated what my change in balance was in the original comment.  
I didn't "want to tell everyone about it", I was joining in on the conversation about people buying BCH.


It's not a basement.  It's an unheated garage/workshop with no existing gas lines in a place that has 6-9 months of winter and heater weather.
As for 


The space heater literally spends 100% of its energy as heat, a mining rig (and any computer) does the same thing but *also mines crypto with it*.  Any mining rig that uses the same kWh *and mines crypto* saves money over a space heater and - as noted above - given my heating season *will absolutely be cheaper than just using a space heater*.  Comparing it to other heating methods, like natural gas, given the size of the space, construction, costs of running a gas line, getting and installing a heater, inspections and permits, etc., etc., etc., the mining rig *still* works out to be cheaper *for my specific situation*.


If less "dudes" were busy being assholes to each other, we wouldn't be in this situation.
I've run the numbers on the options for my space, multiple times over the past weeks, and it did make financial sense.  I did not, at any point, recommend it as the right option for everyone.
By all means though, keep being an armchair expert despite having no knowledge of my personal situation.

If the space were already heated, it wouldn't make any sense to replace it with a miner; but for a new heater the miner is good enough and cheaper than all the costs associated with adding a traditional heater instead.
So I might not see a true profit from mining, but one way or another it'll knock its own cost off of my bills in that 6ish months or so.  
Plus I'll be accruing BTC, so if/when it moons in a few years the cost won't matter :D
Going all dreamer and futurology for a minute: I wish you could get basic miners embedded in lots of home heating formats.  Stuff like an instant water heater with a few chips, mounted under a sink with a hydroelectric generator to offset power usage.  It wouldn't be much, but throw that on say an average of 4 faucets in every house in the county, and suddenly you have a decentralized mining farm; plus everyone's water gets warmer a little quicker.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:38:39
Central Minnesota - 6-9 months of heating weather a year, which is why I don't care about profitability as long as it (mostly) pays its own electric bill :D
Thanks for the offer, but I'm not really looking right now - happy where I'm at and all that.  Chances are you could find someone in the mining subreddit that's a little closer and probably a ton more knowledgeable anyway.  I'm pretty sure I've seen a couple people that run small scale farms there, could maybe start a franchise thing or something.
I'd be happy to be an extra set of eyes on plans or whatever though if you ever want to PM me.  From what I've seen, people tend to get caught up in the mining side of it and forget about the infrastructure to support it, so it can be easy to miss seemingly simple things.
E.g. I don't know CT code, so it might be more strict, but NEC calls for 125% engineering factor on continuous loads. 1500W on 240V comes to 6.25A, but since a miner is running 24/7 you'd need to allocate about 8A per miner; hence only 3 miners per 240V 30A circuit, even though by the base numbers you could fit 4.  It's not uncommon for people to see the base stats and assume they can just plug it in and go on a 120V 15A home circuit in a closet (1200W @ 120V = 10A x 1.25% = 12.5 draw on a circuit that probably already has &gt; 2.5A peak draw on it).

They just have a different setup than Coinbase, so a different purpose when you get in deep enough. When I'm making premeditated moves, I'll transfer money to Gemini and set up the orders, but when I'm being reactionary or want some right now I'll use a credit card on Coinbase. If I need to deal with something other than BTC, ETH, or LTC, then I'll use Kraken to convert. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:27:08
Yeah, I have no problem toggling if it's more profitable during normal day-to-day stuff, I'm just saying during the crazy stuff like this weekend.
I use the networks too, so if one is having troubles then sacrificing the extra few bucks of profit is worth it to keep my own transactions moving.
My rig probably won't be profitable too, just cheaper than alternatives for my situation, so I'm not as incentivized by block profits as I am other mechanisms.

Get a second one and follow the recovery instructions on it.
In case you haven't looked that far: wallets have recovery seeds - basically using keywords to reliably recreate the keys. As a result, you can get a hardware wallet, jot down the recovery seed (as normal for a new wallet), then get a second hardware wallet and "recover" it using the seed from the first wallet. At that point you have an identical copy of a wallet on two devices.
For my purposes, it makes it easier to recover should one device be lost - instead of setting up a new wallet during a crisis, I just grab the second one. It's also a nice insurance policy when doing firmware updates and the likes, since if something fails and the device gets bricked or something, you still have a "known good" backup on the other device.

Don't be surprised to see a 10-20% swing, it'll be gut wrenching to see the value drop, but your biggest enemy in those moments is emotional decision making.  Instead, research and analyze why it might be dropping, just like you did (should have) when you bought in, and make your decisions based on that information.

Are you talking BTC transaction fees, or CC purchase fees?  I ran the CC transaction numbers in $1 increments up to $10, and $10 increments up to $1000 against their API a month ago. These were against my account too, so maybe your region sees different fees or something. 
USD Amount|Fee|
$ 2.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 3.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 4.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 5.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 6.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 7.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 8.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 9.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 10.00 |$ 0.99 |
$ 11.00 |$ 1.49 |
$ 12.00 |$ 1.49 |
$ 13.00 |$ 1.49 |
$ 14.00 |$ 1.49 |
$ 15.00 |$ 1.49 ​|
Up until $70 of purchases the fees appear to be hard-coded: $0.99, $1.49, $1.99, $2.99  After somewhere around $70 it switches to a flat 4ish% fee (variance is just from rounding the pennies). This applied to ETH, LTC, and BTC purchases. 
Tl;DR: buy more than $70ish at a time to get the lowest credit card fee by percentage.

I'm not buying $3 every week....? I'm just reporting what the fee numbers were for different values. Those numbers were all from pulling order quotes via their API - effectively dry runs of a purchase without actually making the purchase. 
I did the bulk of my purchasing back around $1800, so I haven't really personally cared about fees in months.
Anywho, GDAX also isn't available just because you have a Coinbase account. Minnesota and a few other states are not serviced by GDAX, but are by Coinbase.
As far as why ever use a credit card, it depends on how nimble I need to be and how much I need to move. I switch between multiple exchanges and payment methods based on the situation.  If something is going on and I want to buy right this minute, I'll use CC with Coinbase; if I need it within 1-3 days for a large amount, I'll go wire transfer through Gemini; and so forth.

If you don't need to do credit card purchases, I've had good experiences using Gemini for low/no fees too.

The government doesn't have you cash out or take 100% of the profits. I think there's some confusion in responses to your example.
If I buy 1 BTC January 1st 2017 at  and just hold it, then the price on December 31st 2017 doesn't matter and I don't owe any taxes on it for the 2017 tax year. If, however, I sell that 1 BTC on December 31st 2017 for $20k, then I owe tax on $19,999 (only the profit of the investment) for the 2017 tax year. Additionally, if I hold it until January 1st 2018 and sell at $20k, the taxes will be owed on the 2018 tax year - *not* the 2017 tax year.  Also, if I don't sell until January 2nd 2018, then the profits are taxed as long term capital gains (&gt;1 year held), at a lower rate than short term capital gains, for the 2018 tax year.
The trouble I think a lot of people are having is that they're playing day trader, creating a lot of buys and sells throughout the year, meaning additional points in time that they're being taxed at. It's not the holding or buying of coins triggering tax events, it's the selling.

Yes, this. I make some normal trades here or there, but since my company stopped their employee stock purchase plan I just set up automatic schedules to buy the same dollar amount of BTC every paycheck.
Every two weeks, without needing to think about it, my check gets auto deposited to my primary account, my safety buffer bank transfers a set amount from my primary account, and the exchange initiates a purchase from my safety buffer bank. All ACH too, so no fees besides the exchange fee.

FYI, unless they disbanded it, Google has an "afterlife" service that will automatically deactivate your account and send a message to a trusted contact after 3-12 months of inactivity on your account.

"No one bought to send money to other people" (except I did, I just invest as well, and even mine to heat my garage), or "anyone that's OK with this loss is a liar" (except I'm not, because my "account" is still up a few hundred percent - my potential gains are lower right now, but I haven't lost a dime and have outperformed every other investment I have).

If you  just buy BTC and hodl while it increases in value, you don't pay taxes because you haven't "realized" the profit yet. When you sell, if it's worth more than you bought it for, you pay taxes on the difference. Specifics vary by how long you held.

You know what happens when people think "it's only a website, it's no big deal, I can do this change in my sleep!"?
Coinbase and Kraken have multi-day outages.
If you've built "many websites" and don't know this, they either weren't full blown web apps with hundreds of thousands of users (like, say, an exchange), or you got lucky. 
To be clear, I'm a professional full stack software developer. I agree, the change is super easy to make, and if it were a personal website or something small they should just do it. I, however, also recognize that when your business relies on a piece of customer-facing software, you don't fuck around with it just because you think it'll be a quick fix.

Even if they change it in the future, the source code is out and open source.  Just like Bitcoin, there's no stuffing it back in the bag at this point, no matter how much they might try.

I just so happen to have a spreadsheet tracking every single block the pool I use has found, as well as my reward, operating costs, and so forth for the past 50 days.
Daily operating cost of an Antminer S9 @ $0.12187521/kWh is about $3.87, and at the current price of $6,227.06/BTC brings in between $7 to $14 per day (pending pool luck and hash rate; surprisingly closer to $14 the past few days).
Basically the price can drop to $3433.78 and I'd still make a profit on even "bad luck" days, and has to drop below $1721.34 for me to lose money on every day of operation.  All of that isn't including the fact that it has paid for its operating costs for the year already, and I actually got it for heat in a previously unheated space, so I can operate it at a loss for the next year and still be ahead on my overall budget :D

It's one of those things that's been buzzing around a while, so I don't have a specific article, but from a quick search [this]( came up. Looks like they have a lot of stations that already actively participate, so yours might already be on the list.
If not though, they started as Craigslist purchasing/trading places, so that might jog their recognition of what you mean. Worst case, you can basically ask if they have any public space to safely meet and trade something at the station (just don't make it sound like a drug deal :P).

At a theoretical level, nowhere, they don't exist. The block chain is effectively a ledger of transactions - if a transaction says Address A sent Address B 1BTC, then the person with the keys to Address B can draw against that transaction to send up to 1BTC to other addresses. It's all stored and tracked in the block chain though. So you don't have 1BTC so much as you have record of receiving 1BTC that you haven't spent yet - almost like doing all of your banking online, you don't physically touch the dollars, you just have records of transactions in and out of your account that settle out to your balance.
Your wallet just gives you access to send transactions from that account.


Generally, yeah. I haven't heard of any that are one-and-done. With hardware wallets at least you just hit a button or dropdown to switch between currencies.  All the currencies have different features, but the general idea of the public blockchain and signing transactions with your wallet's keys should apply to all of them.

Sort of.  The thought that led me to the Visa conclusion is similar to what I think the bankers are thinking (maybe not at the old-guard level of management, but business strategists and all that): that they can try to stay ahead of it and pivot themselves to remain relevant.
Until UBI is a thing, people will need to invest if they ever hope to retire, and some people will always be terrible with money.  People will also still need loans for things like mortgages and cars.  There will also be people that are always weary of their own security - seeing an FDIC insured bank as a better option than stashing your ~~cash~~ recovery seed under your mattress.  Banks effectively offer investment and money management services, satisfying those needs.
I see it less like digging their own graves and more like the music and movie industry in the early 2000's.  The banking industry won't die, but banks will see a radical transformation in business model to support the new systems; just like music and movies didn't die when Napster and Netflix came out.

My normal route is to check each character every time it's prompted (I'm used to inspecting semi-random strings so it doesn't take long), then do a transfer for a small amount like 1% of my intended transaction.

People are against big bankers' greed, lobbying, etc. for how they've changed our governments and regulations to maximize their profits in fiat. Those bankers are now starting to see Bitcoin and crypto as a huge potential investment opportunity.  There's no way they don't fight to protect their new investments at this point, which indirectly protects *our* investments.
The regulatory changes will be interesting in the next few years, but at least the financial portions of the US government will most likely be supporting the currencies, even if only due to pressure from the likes of Fidelity.

But a natural gas heater doesn't pay for its own gas, making a natural gas heater less economically efficient than a miner.
Gas vs Electric = Gas wins
Gas vs Mining = Mining wins (even operating at a loss, as long as the loss is less than it would cost to run the gas heater)
One quirk is that most people already have natural gas equipment, so it doesn't make sense to switch from one form of heat to another due to the cost of mining equipment.  If you're looking at heating an unheated space though, it's pretty much a wash.

That really depends on your exchange and verification limits.  I can do $15k/week through Coinbase's ACH purchase (all at once if I want). Gemini has the $500/day limit for ACH, but (at least for me) says no limit on wire transfers, which are same day but just carry a wire transfer fee.

No problem, all it took was a little bit of reading ;)
Regarding your actual question, I don't have anything solid but I kind of suspect the causation may have been reversed from what you're thinking: market fluctuation caused some people to lose money, those people started looking for every possible reason for their loss despite the vast majority of people still being positive, triggering others to start getting wary and backing out, causing more people to be at a loss, and from that point it just became a self-fullfilling FOMO Exodus.
I saw a lot of language like "everyone here is new" coming from people that obviously had an axe to grind (based on other comments and language), implying they were possibly projecting a bit to make themselves feel more justified taking a loss or to justify being frustrated at the market instead of their own decisions to jump into a market they didn't learn about first.  The community has grown a bunch the past year, so there are a lot of new people, but what I was seeing was a lot more hyperbolic than I'd expect with that growth.

I'd suggest using a paper wallet and doing some normal secure-storage techniques - keep a copy in a safe deposit box, fireproof safe, etc. so there's no risk of losing it all if your house burns down or something.  Just make sure any copies are with entities you trust too.
If you store them in an online service, there's no guarantee the service (or your account on it) will still be accessible when the time comes, so you definitely want them in your own wallet.  I personally went with a hardware wallet &amp; offsite backup, but since you have no intent to sell them for the time being, a paper wallet probably makes more sense for you (plus hardware wallets cost ~100 USD).
Otherwise, as mentioned by someone else, the easiest way is to just buy in a little at a time, then send them to the address for your wallet.  If your finances are predictable, some exchanges will let you set up recurring purchases, so you only need to worry about jumping on to send them to your wallet's address when they settle.
As far as trying to create them, you'd be looking at mining; but it's highly unlikely to be profitable as an average person due to energy costs (i.e. the electric cost to power the computer to mine them will be higher than the value of the coins you receive).  As a "normal" person your best bet is to just outright purchase coins.

Supposedly they receive $1 and create 1 Tether. But there's nothing technically stopping them from issuing 1 Tether for receiving $0, so there are concerns that they might be. Those concerns are amplified by the fact that they haven't been audited and conveniently keep having reasons for why they haven't yet, making it seem like they're actively avoiding auditing, making it seem more likely that they are issuing Tether for $0.
At the end of the day, without that audit, there's no proof that they're actually in control of $1 for every 1 Tether issued.

A decent part of it is probably the numbers of people we're talking about.  A few months ago we were at what, 100-200k users here?  Now we're up to 720k.

Gemini doesn't allow credit card purchases though, and can take a little longer to set up due to bank verification.  Coinbase has higher fees, but you can work around those by using GDAX (exchange that backs Coinbase). 
Point is, use all exchanges available to you and work their pros and cons to your benefit at the moment you need to buy/sell :)

I understand how people can fall into those traps, but I have enough financial discipline to handle it :)
I mostly use it as an indicator of when I should check the news these days, and to be more precise when I have a planned move coming up. I won't make a sell or buy order that I haven't already planned on, but I might make it a little earlier or later if I see the price doing something interesting.
Otherwise it just helps me keep a pulse on the coins and get a better feel for how they move over time, so I'm not caught off guard when I get home and there was a 10-20% swing.

ACH takes 3-5 days per the system, but there are two topics that spin off with regards to Coinbase.
First is that you might have a wire transfer option available.  Wire transfers do have a fee that's set by your bank, but they typically process within 1 business day (whenever your bank processes their next batch of wire transfers).
Second, this somewhat depends on how Coinbase is regulated in your area since that changes what account features are available, but if you can do a purchase that pulls from your bank immediately (as opposed to sending money to your Coinbase account, then buying coins once it's cleared) then your price will be locked in immediately and the coins will just be frozen until the ACH transfer comes through.  Like my CB account doesn't have a USD wallet, so I can make a purchase for 1 BTC @ $8250 via ACH right now, and my CB account will be credited that 1 (frozen) BTC and an ACH transfer will be initiated for $8250, then once the ACH transfer completes that 1 BTC will be unfrozen.  It means if I did that today and the price crashes tomorrow, I couldn't sell it (since it would still be frozen), but if I'm looking at holding beyond 3 days then that doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:45:25

Also open a buffer bank account. As many people as there have been that have (supposedly) had their bank accounts closed for transactions relating to crypto, it's worth it to use an account that isn't linked to everything else in your life.  That way if it does happen, at least you don't need to set up every direct deposit and auto pay schedule at a new bank all over again. 
You can set up an account at (at least some) online-only banks in under 30 minutes, and do ACH or wire transfers to/from them just like any other bank.

The transaction takes 3-5 days, that's part of the ACH network, not anything Coinbase has control over.  Coinbase is just willing to front you the purchase price until it clears the ACH process now.
If you want same day deposits from sales, use wire transfers instead.

Yup.  Bitcoin and other cryptos are a new, safer, more reliable way to stuff your cash into your mattresses, with the added perk of being able to transact against it without touching a bank.
We've always been able to store cash like that, but we created banks because we wanted safer ways to store it and occasionally need a loan.
Those things can be overcome with cryptocurrencies, but eventually we'll wind up back at banks.  People don't have cutting edge vaults at home in case of break in or fire, so people will want to store some of their value at off-site facilities that do (i.e. banks).  You can, technically, find a millionaire willing to lend you $250k for a mortgage, but eventually those lenders will want to group up to split risks (at the cost of splitting the profits too).
We might see some major banks fail as things change, and hopefully some of the bad stuff in the banking system gets reduced, but the tools the banks offer would still be needed - even outside of the general simplification.
I really wouldn't be surprised to see the likes of Fidelity or Goldman-Sachs creating their own exchanges to add to their product portfolios within the next 5-10 years.

Why do so many people seem to misuse the negative sign?  Is it normal in some locality around the world to use -$5k when meaning under $5k?  In my region at least a -$5k price would mean negative $5k, which means you're paying someone to take your Bitcoin; whereas &lt;$5k would mean less than $5k.
I'm not trying to harass anyone with this, I just keep seeing people write it with the negative sign instead of the less than sign and in a couple contexts it has made it a little hard to tell what they meant.

I only used Kraken to swap BCH to LTC.  Seemed pretty straight forward overall, with a pretty solid array of features.
It felt a bit like Gemini just with a bunch of additional coins (and some more advanced order placement tools).  Their verification stuff is laid out a little differently, but is also a lot more transparent than the other two (you can see everything you need for any tier ahead of time, so you can get everything together and plow through all the verifications at once).

I haven't used a paper wallet (needed the features of a hardware wallet more), but there should be a guide somewhere in the sidebar links; or potentially by using the search tool for this subreddit.
The basic idea though, is that you generate a new wallet, then print out the address and private keys on a piece of paper. 
Transferring out is a similar process to normal transfers. You plug the private key info into some wallet software, then tell it to sign and send the transaction just like it normally would. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:19:03
Other exchanges (and users) have, until now at least, trusted that they only issue 1 Tether for every $1 they have; so they can buy BTC from other exchanges or users via Tether.
If they're issuing Tether without actually having $1 per Tether, that means they can effectively buy BTC for free, then sell it elsewhere for USD.
Just imagine for a second that traditional banking were completely unregulated and unaudited.  I could create my own fake bank, say that someone put $1,000,000 into my account there, send a wire transfer from that account to a real bank for that amount, then go to that real bank and withdraw it in cash; all because they trust that my bank has $1,000,000 to send them, because my fake bank said they totally received it in cash.  I get $1,000,000 physically in my pocket (or on a pallet in my garage) by taking that real bank's physical dollar bills, meanwhile they *think* they're receiving $1,000,000 from my fake bank so they're OK with it... until they go to collect and find out that money never existed.
I don't really have an opinion one way or the other if that's actually going on with Tether, but I definitely understand the suspicions given the sketchy behavior around having it audited.
**E** In the case of BTC, this can also have the effect of artificially inflating the price, since the other exchanges count it as being bought at the USD equivalent when bought with Tether.

By having enough bitcoin to buy a car and an exchange with a high enough limit (or split among multiple exchanges) :) Gemini has no dollar limit on wire transfers (at least for me in Minnesota), so I could cash out enough to buy a house if I had it.  Otherwise, for ACH transfers, I think Coinbase can get up to $15k withdrawal limit / week, then you can do the rest (if needed) through a different exchange.


I haven't heard of any locally, but I don't watch for it so there could be someone under the radar that does.  I know there are a few in the US though - I think a couple in California and Florida are the last I've seen buzz about.

Not sure why, but I was thinking exclusively server side, somehow forgot that just attacking clients was an option too.  I forget the specifics, but you can also register your site with Google, Firefox, etc. through a portal somewhere to always use HTTPS - so that would cover first-visit attacks too.  Last I checked, I think that was free but was a risk if you couldn't guarantee your site would always support HTTPS (since it would stop loading over HTTP at all in their browsers).
Htbridge also has a test similar to SSLLabs. I generally use both just to cover my bases since they aren't 100% redundant. If you're testing an ASP.Net site too, ASafaWeb has .Net-specific test page that checks form submission attacks, error pages, and a few other things. 
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:53:19
Yeah, it all depends on the exchange, some of your details (verification level, location), and transfer method.
For purchases, I think Coinbase for me is at $5k/week via CC, $10k/week via ACH, and Gemini is $500/day via ACH, and no limit via wire.  For sales, Coinbase via ACH is $15k/week, and Gemini is $100k/day via ACH and unlimited via wire.
The lower limits are typically if you're not fully verified yet.

My understanding is that it can be used to buy from other exchanges.
So Company A can create tether, then use it to buy coins from Company B. Company B thinks the tether is legitimately backed by Company A's USD holdings, so they accept it as a coin-to-coin trade on the expectation that they can eventually trade it back to Company A at a value of $1/Tether. All the while Company A is saying "Don't worry, we're totally good for it bro!"
I like the idea, it's just the suspicious lack of auditing that has a lot of people concerned.
@_date: 2017-10-17 04:20:32
If you can - it's a common misconception that a Coinbase account automatically gives you a GDAX account. People in Minnesota and a few other states (and I'm sure there are other catches) can't open a GDAX account but can open a Coinbase account, and even once they have a Coinbase account they still can't use it to log in to GDAX.
Because of that little quirk I haven't been able to try them myself. Without seeing a transaction myself, it's possible GDAX is like Gemini (for me at least) and they just covered the wire transfer fee, and didn't give you an option since it'd be stupid (as a user) to choose ACH if wires are free.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:32:58
Doesn't look like it from a quick check. The app is pretty limited vs the full site though, so possibly through the website, or a tech support ticket (to get your wire info added). Might be restricted or something too - like your locale's regulatory requirements, needing an extra verification, etc. 
Worst case, you can sell through other exchanges too.  Last time I sold, I wanted the money fast, so I sold through Gemini and wired it to my bank account - had it fully available within 18 hours (wire transfers are processed on your bank's schedule - e.g. mine processes all wire transfers around 3/4pm EST each business day).  I know people have used wire transfers through Coinbase though.
Mostly I just wanted to clarify that - no matter who you're dealing with - the 3-5 day waiting period was a function of the payment method and not the vendor. The next fastest is wire transfer, for same/next business day. After that, credit/debit is the fastest but only work as payment, not receipt, methods.
**Edit** Wire transfers also carry a wire transfer fee of around $35.  Similar to ACH times, that fee is part of the network and not a fee charged by Coinbase, Gemini, or any other vendor. I think Gemini covered it when I sold, where Coinbase might not, but no matter who paid it was still charged.

Where on earth did I say that? 
I'm just saying this particular chart gets rolled out every time it drops and treated as though it's an accurate prediction that we're in the final drop, despite the fact that we haven't been in the final drop during any of the previous two dozen times it's been brought up. 
At some point, if he hadn't died, Harold Camping's predictions that "No really guys, *this* is the year the world ends!" would have been correct too, but only because we already know the sun will eventually explode and take out the inner planets, not because he was somehow an accurate predictor.
As the saying goes, even a broken clock is right two times a day. Eventually, at some point, this chart will match up with what happens. But much like a broken clock, being correct every once in a great while and wrong the other 99% of the time doesn't make it an even remotely useful tool.

From what I've seen, worst case is normally that Coinbase (possibly other exchanges) may shut down your account if they see that BTC you purchased gets sent to a known sketchy address within their search limits (again, just 3 transactions IIRC).  Annoying, but if you keep your coins off the exchange like you should, not the end of the world (if you _do_ have coins on it, then you might have difficulty getting them back off).  Similar to the verification documentation, it's just them protecting themselves for regulatory purposes.  You can also bounce it through a few of your own addresses first, then scramble, and send to wherever (just so sending it to the scrambler doesn't result in it going to someone that uses it for sketchy purposes).
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:25:45
My understanding is that most places that look for those signs only look 2-3 transactions deep (at least, last I saw that's as far as Coinbase looked).
If you're looking to hide your transactions, coin scramblers are an option.  For acquiring coins though I don't think there's much you can do (you could scramble inbound coins too, but there's no guarantee that the scrambled coins are any cleaner).

Thanks for being a voice of reason.
Also, fun fact with point 1: even on your first visit a properly set up server can still force HTTPS before the HSTS flag takes effect.
Of course, the number of properly set up web servers is probably depressingly small.
For anyone that wants to test a site's HTTPS setup, securityheaders.io will check their headers, and ssllabs.com has a server test that will check their certs and susceptibility to other SSL/TLS related attacks.

Properly set up HTTPS shouldn't be susceptible to downgrade attacks.  Poorly set up HTTPS definitely can be, just wondering if they were hitting a misconfigured site or if there's a genuine HTTPS vulnerability.

I'll use whatever system is more appropriate for the transaction I'm trying to perform. 
If I'm buying something online and the place accepts crypto, I'll use crypto because it's just as easy and fast as entering my credit card info. But if I'm at a food truck with a line behind me, even if they accept crypto, you can damn well bet that I'm just gonna hand them a $10 bill and tell them to keep the change.
Even beyond the personal hassle that crypto incurs in some instances, I don't want everyone behind me to see crypto transactions an annoyance that made it take longer for them to order.
@_date: 2018-04-30 18:20:56
That's why I specified just giving them a 10 and telling them to keep the change in my example of a situation where crypto is slower.  This isn't even getting into software or device glitches that can cause hangups and delays.  Not that those things happen frequently, but a phone being slow or a battery dying certainly happens more frequently than a $10 note suddenly being worthless. 
Credit cards are probably the closest 1-to-1 comparison of the crypto process. You pull it out of your wallet, swipe or insert it, and you're on your way... Unless the reader mis-reads it, or the system is acting sluggish, or any number of other things that can go wrong with complex technology (even complex tech that seems simple to the user).  (Note: Just in case you're in the EU or something, not all credit card transactions require signatures or pins - most of my CC purchases are literally just swiping a card.) Heck, one of the local sports stadiums even had their entire credit and debit processing systems crash for an hour just before the game, and there I was getting my food with cash while almost everyone else was in line to use the ATM.
At the end of the day, what I'm getting at is that no one system will always be 100% effective for 100% of situations. If it works for every situation you get yourself in, awesome, more power to you, but that doesn't mean everyone gets into the same situations and it doesn't mean that it's a flawless system.  I am certainly excited for it, and I hope it gets as big as we expect it to, I'm just a hardcore realist when it comes to new tech on a worldwide scale.  
By comparison, a couple years ago people were talking about how Tesla's Auto Pilot could be used by everyone within 5 years, and was already nearly flawless, and how I was insane for saying it still had a long ways to go.  Pretty much this exact conversation as applied to self-driving vehicles.  Lo and behold we start having major accidents because people are treating it as perfectly capable of handling every situation when it clearly isn't.

Duct the heat from an ASIC so it can stay clean, and you might be able to make this work. Not sure how many you'd need off hand, but each S9 is about 5000 BTU.  I'm seeing recommendations for 80-100 BTU per square inch when looking for a grill, so that'd give you around 50 square inches of cooking surface (assuming there's since efficiency loss from the duct radiating heat before it reaches the end).

You need to pull out your phone and open your wallet software in order to scan that barcode.  Similarly, credit cards can still be a hassle, since you need to swipe or insert them. 
I'm not saying it'll take minutes longer or anything, it's just a little extra time and hassle that you may not always be able to accommodate.  
In some situations, a physical token of value is just always going to be faster and/or easier, and in some rarer situations will even be the only way.  That's why I'll probably never be 100% crypto only and would rather use whichever system makes the most sense (**e**: most sense for a given situation I mean).

Mining = your bank processing transactions. 
Nodes = keeping a copy of the ledger and making sure the bank's math is right. 
Generally, places you're paying require a transaction be validated post-mining ("confirmed") a certain number of times before it's trusted and considered settled.
More nodes is better to verify the miners are processing correctly, and to hit the number of minimum confirmations faster; but it's not a requirement to run one in order to use bitcoin just like it isn't a requirement to balance your checkbook just to write a check. It's still a good idea, just not the end of the world if you don't.

Yes. Have a bank account linked to it and at level 2 verification I could buy $10k and sell $15k/week.  Level 3 (level 2 + a wait period) bumped it to buy/sell $15k/week.  Not sure which level I'm at for CC (2 or 3?), but that limit is at $2k/week now and at least one more level is listed.

Saying "the moon is made out of cheese" is a wrong but coherent statement that can be intelligently refuted and (probably) educate the person making it (assuming that the person saying it simply doesn't know any better, which is more common than people like to acknowledge).
Saying "I can have and go to always" is an incoherent statement that does nothing to refute the original statement and only serves to make the person who stated the original statement think that you're stupid.
It's like someone saying "The moon is made of cheese" and replying with "The sky is blue!" - they're just going to dismiss your reply. The other option - "Actually, the moon most likely formed as the result of an impact with early Earth, breaking off a chunk of the Earth's surface, so it's mostly stone and minerals like we'd find here" - takes a little longer in the short term, but has more likelihood of the person you're responding to actually taking what you said to heart as it actually relates to the conversation, seeks to educate, and doesn't just dismiss them.
@_date: 2017-07-31 04:09:32
Ok, so overall it's pretty straight forward - just an HTTP Get call to get current values from an API, then a JavaScriptlet to push the values into variables that you can do whatever else you want with.  In my case, I push them to my watch face (I used the WatchMaker app to make it, since it's pretty easy and has a Tasker communication plugin); but you can also make Tasker just set the media volume and use Text-To-Speech to audibly say whatever you want - I'll go over both options below:
1. Add an HTTP Get command, server:port set to   - I use GDAX as my exchange, so my link is: [ (click the link to see the data if you want - it's pretty straight forward as value:key items, with a nested list for the complex data).  This command will actually pull the data down for you to manipulate at-will.  BitcoinAverage has a knowledge base for their API if you want to look up other available exchanges or something.
2. Add a JavaScriptlet command.  I'm just interested in BTC and ETH prices, so I just have a 2-line command.  The basic structure is:
        setGlobal('MyTaskerVariable',JSON.parse(global('HTTPD')).{ValueToGet});
    So for BTC and ETH in USD, being set to my BtcPrice and EthPrice variables appropriately, it's:
        setGlobal('BtcPrice',JSON.parse(global('HTTPD')).symbols["BTCUSD"].last);
        setGlobal('EthPrice',JSON.parse(global('HTTPD')).symbols["ETHUSD"].last);
3. Do whatever you want with it.  For me, it's calling WatchMaker's "WM Send Variable" command in Tasker to send %BtcPrice and %EthPrice to my watch face, which then has a field for each value.  I also have my total quantity of each stored in Tasker variables, so I multiply that by %XXXPrice as appropriate to get my total value.  
I also have a "SayText" generic task set up, so I could have it speak out a sentence.  Setup for that is below, format for the code block is: CommandName - parameters {Notes}
    Variable Set - NAME %originalvolume TO %VOLM {Set the "originalvolume local variable to current media volume}
    If %par1 IS SET {Make sure the text to say is actually set}
        Media Volume - LEVEL %par2 IF %par2 IS SET {If the second parameter was passed, change the media volume}
        Media Volume - LEVEL 3 IF %par2 IS NOT SET {If the second parameter was not passed, just use volume level 3}
        Say - TEXT %par1 ENGINE:VOICE default:default {Actually speak the text}
        Media Volume - LEVEL %originalvolume {Reset the media volume back to what it was}
    End If
Then, call that task at the end of your price getter (or wherever it makes sense) via:
    Perform Task - NAME SayText PARAMETER 1 **{Whatever you want the text to say}** PARAMETER 2 **{Volume level, 0-15}**
      
So something like:
    Perform Task - NAME SayText PARAMETER 1 Current Bitcoin price is %BtcPrice PARAMETER 2 15
Will speak "Current Bitcoin price is *{whatever the price is}* at max volume.
**Edit** If you don't care about the volume bits, you could also just call Say, with the following:
    Say - TEXT Current Bitcoin price is %BtcPrice ENGINE:VOICE default:Default IF %BtcPrice IS SET

Running a node, you're still waiting on a miner to actually process it before you can validate their work.  Unless you're also mining and somehow prioritizing your transactions, you're still trusting someone else to tell you when and if your transaction is settled. 
*Just* running a node is like reviewing your bank account's ledger. Making a payment still relies on the banking system to move the funds, you're just verifying it was done right.
**Edit** Basically, it's still a good idea, but isn't as absolutely required as it's made to seem.  More nodes is better, but one more is just a drop in the bucket.

Why do you assume the government is the only thing to be afraid of in this situation?
For every billionaire running around giving public speeches, followed by paparazzi, blamed for everything good or bad, and being asked for handouts from "friends" and "family", how many hidden millionaires do you think live in just your county/state (or your countries equivalent)?
If I were Satoshi, I would have stayed quiet too - and no government would be anywhere near the first on my list of things to fear.
*Edit*: Just look at how much vitriol gets spewed at some of the names you mentioned.  It doesn't matter whether you think they're good or bad, someone out there thinks they're god, and someone else literally wants them dead because they do/don't agree with their stance on an issue.  Not all people want that kind of publicity.
*Edit 2*: Taking it a step further, and explaining why I wouldn't really fear government as much in Satoshi's case: Governments are people.  Not in the "hurdur corporations are people" way, but in the "they are not fully autonomous and reflect of the actions and mindsets of the people within them" way.  Governments are inherently flawed because people - all people - are flawed.  The people that you're afraid of within a government don't magically go away the moment they leave office, and they didn't just pop into existence the moment they were voted in. Ultimately the kinds of people you fear in government exist in the public in similar proportions (if not more in the public, due to the extremists that are unelectable).

Or that they lost the credentials to.  So many legit reasons for multiple accounts or new accounts.

You know, like international relations, government management, and GDP that relate to money similarly to how those things relate to stock.  It's almost like money can be an investment and we just call the entities "countries" and "governments" instead of "companies".

Aaand you're on a list.

Yup, I set up a savings account with Ally exclusively to make crypto transactions. Used 2 exchanges so far and the closest I've gotten to a warning was that I hit the 6 outbound transactions/statement limit (normal federal limit from my understanding, didn't care where it was going to just noted that after 6 there's a mandated fee). Limit might not exist on checking accounts, but for 1+% interest on any fiat I'm holding there I don't mind less frequent transactions.

Exactly my plan.  
I've been thinking about starting a node, maybe playing around with mining, and other deeper stuff, but the amount of MAGA-level rhetoric being spewed on both sides has convinced me to just stay out of it until both teams settle down.  Until then, I buy and watch the pretty charts without getting a headache.

Why hold when you can buy for a discount?

I'd generalize his advice a little more for non-US: just read up on any tax laws or get a tax dude that is informed on cryptocurrencies and how your government handles those gains :)
As nice as crypto is for its own global markets, at the end of the day if you convert to local fiat you need to play by their rules (if there are any) or risk their punishments.

Being on *a* list isn't a problem - if you're not on at least one list, you're either super boring or not doing something right. 
Still rather not be on *that* list though, since it's the sort of thing that has gotten cops at people's doors and ruined lives before.

Just a heads up, I haven't had it this bad but I have had situations where credit reporting agencies had incorrect info, and were unable to verify my identity as a result.
It most likely has absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin, and everything to do with Equifax/IDMatrix having the wrong address on file or in your history, stuff like that.
I know from what you said you didn't see this specific screen, but just as an example: I'll sometimes see stuff like "Pick your previous address from the list" followed by 3 I've never lived at and an "None of these" option; then picking "None of these" throws the "could not verify your identity" error.  Most of the time, I just wait a while and try again, but don't submit until I can get a different set of questions or valid answers available.  (These were definitely freak-out moments for me, doing an immediate thorough review of my credit history.)
TL;DR: I wouldn't be surprised if IDMatrix improperly "verified" your identity, incorrectly flagging you as not being you to the bank and energy company - instead of it being bitcoin related.  It would arguably be a worse situation since it can happen to people that don't have any account closures in their histories let alone bitcoin transactions; just not as conspiracy-theory-y or malicious as you might expect.

With Android, Tasker, and Mycelium, you could just leave an old phone you're OK with not having plugged in somewhere at your origin, then set it up to transfer the funds to a whole new wallet when you send it a specific text message.
I don't even really have an opinion on the bill, it's just written poorly with a bunch of loopholes.

That is one of my favorite autocorrects ever. I'm just imagining a substitute teacher, someone in the process of a divorce or something similarly world shattering, walking into class and sitting down at the desk. They pull out their thermos, filled with the cheapest vodka they could get, sigh at the rowdy class, and mumble that phrase as they crack it open.

Depends on if you can sell them for enough to be reportable.

Everyone has pretty much covered the bitcoin aspect at this point, so for future reference:
* Keep backups
* Keep your passphrase/seed
* Keep your machine up to date. The hole the current two big ransomwares use has been patched for months now - before they even hit the public. Assuming you got hit with one of those, it's because you didn't practice safe security practices and weren't keeping your machine up to date.
