Sure, current holders could also decide to sell more than usual, which would cause a supply increase. My point is, "all else holding constant," the halving will reduce incoming supply and disrupt the current equilibrium. This must lead to a price increase if everything else remains the same.

I was a huge skeptic early on.  And I stood by in disbelief during the rally from $10 to $100, missing the entire thing.

I didn't downvote you. And I'm not going to type an essay describing the finer points of Austrian economics.  Arguing economics with strangers on the internet is waste of time.  Read "The Road To Serfdom" by FA Hayek if you want to learn something new from someone smarter than both of us.
@_date: 2016-04-07 15:58:32
That is true. What I was suggesting is: "if all else remains constant" a decrease to incoming supply will disrupt equilibrium and cause a price increase. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 22:37:51
Dude..."modern economic theory" is entirely grounded in Keynesian principles.  Source: I earned a bachelor's degree in Economics.  Read "The Road To Serfdom" by FA Hayek if you really want to open your mind.
@_date: 2016-04-07 14:45:40
He's right.  Based on the current inflation rate, demand is consistent enough to keep the price constant.  In other words - we are at equilibrium right now, more or less.  If supply is cut in half (and demand remains the same) the price must go up.  
@_date: 2016-04-23 19:18:48
I'm totally in the same boat.  I've had the Shift card for months and I've only used it once.  I could spend my BTC, but I'd rather spend the fiat. (also, I earn a 1.5% cash back reward for using my primary VISA)

@_date: 2016-04-07 16:23:01
Agree to disagree, I guess.  If future supply cuts are known and fully priced in, then what you're suggesting is that all future halvings are already accounted for.  That may be true, but I find it unlikely.  I see Bitcoin as an immature market that is constantly struggling to find equilibrium.  Not enough history for market participants to anticipate the effects of future supply and demand changes.  
@_date: 2016-04-17 17:20:26
"All else being equal," the halving will cut daily selling pressure massively, which will put upward pressure on the price.  This is Econ 101 baby!

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:13:15
So uh...do you realize *why* the value of the dollar has been going down for so long?  You're basically saying it's not fair that the Fed needs to keep printing exponentially more money to erode the dollar's value at the same rate.  That is true, and there's nothing misleading about that fact.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:58:51
You can really change your perspective on the world when you realize that maybe, just maybe, the guys who write econ textbooks don't know everything.  Try to open your eyes to a different viewpoint and think for yourself.  There's a reason why so many people didn't see Bitcoin coming.  Anyways, have a nice day.

This is Keynesian nonsense and it's completely wrong.  That's like saying "nobody will ever buy a TV because they get cheaper every year!"  If you want to believe Keynesian propaganda, maybe you should stick to r/economics and find another community.  There's a reason people like Paul Krugman have been completely wrong about Bitcoin for years.
@_date: 2015-12-16 23:49:24
Yes, exactly this.  Stocks split after years of going up in price because people "feel" like they are too expensive.  Would you feel more excited about buying one share of Company X for $1,000 or 100 shares for $10/each?  People tend to strongly prefer the latter, even though both investments are the same.  It's all about investor psychology.

@_date: 2015-12-22 22:47:13
I've actually brought up Bitcoin to my friends very recently for a legitimate reason - I'm the commish of our fantasy football league, and everyone owes dues.  People in my league live all over the world.  I explained that Coinbase will give them $10 in free Bitcoin and I'll even throw in an extra $5 discount if they pay with Bitcoin, but still nobody showed any interest.  Pretty amazing right?  I was told that I need to "get with the times and download Venmo."  This is how the average person views Bitcoin.  And keep in mind, these guys are all men about ~30 years old, the largest segment of Bitcoin users.
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:09:55
I'm not gonna try to argue with you any further.  If you couldn't understand the simple analogy I made, trying to educate you is a waste of time.  Go back to r/all and we'll see you next time Bitcoin ends up on the front page.

I earned a bachelor's degree in Econ.  Luckily I also double majored in math or I probably wouldn't have gotten a decent job.

Yeah I have an econ degree too.  Economics (the kind they teach in academia) is voodoo science and mostly unproven theoretical nonsense.
@_date: 2015-12-16 03:36:40
Yes I totally understand that...but people fall prey to the psychological effect.  People like owning "lots of units" of whatever.  They won't like dropping $1,000 and just getting one unit of Bitcoin.  That is why companies undergo stock splits.  Their market cap isn't increasing, they are just making shares appear "affordable."
@_date: 2015-12-29 17:11:07
It's possible they're still holding those coins.  With Blythe in control of such a large number of BTC, it honestly scares me.  She built a career on manipulating commodity prices.
@_date: 2015-12-23 17:56:37

Where was it stated how much BTC the Winklevii are floating for the ETF though?  Also just to be clear, if demand for COIN shares increases, the authorized participants will be going out to purchase Bitcoin on the open market.  That is why people are so bullish on the impact of this ETF.

The financial elites will never accept competition to the Dollar.  If they can co-opt the narrative and draw attention away from Bitcoin (by ignoring it and focusing instead on "Blockchain") their hope is that Bitcoin will lose relevancy over time.  Deloitte has close ties with extremely powerful people and they are going to play ball. Furthermore, they would never risk embarrassing themselves by taking on a friendly stance towards Bitcoin if none of the other major consulting outfits are.  This narrative will be difficult to combat if they actually manage to start launching useful "blockchain" applications.

@_date: 2016-03-30 17:01:23
I think because Bitcoin isn't a mature market (like oil) where a disruption in supply has a predictable effect. Furthermore, Bitcoins aren't consumed in a predictable manner like an industrial asset.  There is no way to predict future demand for Bitcoin, so how could a future supply effect be factored in?

I'm telling ya...this is how ETF's work.  Check out [this article]( that talks about how the GLD ETF operates.  Authorized participants have to buy or sell the underlying asset to make sure share prices actually track the price of the underlying asset.  Otherwise, what you are describing (with a fixed share allotment) is basically how GBTC operates, and that's why it's so bad at tracking the price.

So I actually opened up your link to Merriam-Webster.  The first definition of ridiculous is "deserving of ridicule."  You feel like I deserve to be ridiculed because my opinion is different from yours?  
  
Onto your next point.  There's obviously nothing wrong with being a teenager, but if you mean it in a derogatory way, then guess what?  It's an insult.  If I call some man on the street a "little girl" he will probably be insulted, even though there is nothing inherently wrong with being a little girl.  
  
Lastly, maybe you don't feel your insults are hurtful to others, but this is how bullying often works.  YOU don't think it's a big deal to lob a few insults.  I'll be okay personally, but maybe your next "argument" will cause some poor soul a lot of distress.

@_date: 2017-03-06 16:02:55
@_date: 2016-01-20 19:45:29
I'd say BRK-A is the exception, rather than the rule.  How many other stocks out there decided against a stock split after an appreciable increase in price over time?  As for gold, I'm not sure it's valued because it's expensive.  I personally value it because it's scarce and limited in supply (similar to Bitcoin).  A lot of dummies out there think you can only buy a full Bitcoin if you want to get involved.  Ask around and you will hear it all the time from normal folks.

Do you have a source for this? I was under the impression that the ETF authorized buyers would be fully sourcing all of the BTC on the marketplace.   What you are saying is basically the equivalent of the Winklevii "selling" their BTC to buyers of the ETF.

Dude you need a better microphone
@_date: 2016-01-20 18:49:23
If you want to entice buyers they need to believe they are getting a "good price."  The average person doesn't understand the idea of market cap, and how 1BTC represents a different % of the total relative to buying one share of stock in Company X.  People will only see $500 Bitcoin and go "wow that is expensive."

Coinbase isn't for "trading."  They are a broker and are better suited for hodlers that don't care as much about trying to time the market.  I've been using them for years and have never had a problem.

I imagine this competing with LocalBitcoin's business model.  As for becoming the "Uber" of transferring currency, I struggle to see how the incentives will be worth one's while as a teller.  I would have to meet up with someone and do a physical cash exchange to earn...maybe $1 or $2 in fees?  Not sure if the incentives are strong enough.  Different from Uber where you are constantly earning $5-$10 a pop for each new customer.

What you're not considering is that Bitcoin is a brand new asset and humans are still in the process of discovering the right price for it.  You cannot avoid "volatility" for the foreseeable future, but eventually the price should level out.

This article is like a master class in how to write negatively about a subject while reporting positive news.  Look carefully at the selection of words and phrasing used consistently throughout the piece.  The opening paragraph associates Bitcoin with criminals, and reminds the reader that any gains are merely temporary according to "Bitcoin insiders."  Two more paragraphs are used to appropriately set the stage in a negative light, before finally revealing that there is some positive news to report regarding Bitcoin.

Completely agree.  We need to convert to a new standard unit of measurement.
@_date: 2016-12-27 19:11:25
Part of the problem is these guys are "all in" in the precious metals narrative.  I've been following Maloney and Schiff for years, I've read all their books.  They are brilliant guys but I don't think they will ever come out and say Bitcoin is a better investment than gold/silver.  They may someday acknowledge that crypto investments have a place in your portfolio.  IMO, the writing is on the wall, crypto isn't going anywhere (but up).

Exactly.  Peter Thiel provides excruciating detail as to why he supports Trump, yet this guy "has no idea" why Thiel would support him.  Maybe it's because he has no real interest in hearing a viewpoint that could differ from his own.

I feel like this comment needs more attention.  They absolutely had the power to go through with this, which IMO exposes a major flaw in the current governance.  We should all be thankful they chose not to go through with it.

Remember how Kim Dotcom hyped up MU2 during 2016 with claims that it was going live in January 2017?  And then when January came around we got a vague response about development needing more time?  I also remember him making up claims about having insider knowledge of the FBI planning to indict Hillary Clinton.  This guy is completely full of shit.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:23:38
Just to add onto my comment: this video was released over a year ago.  Since then, they decided MU2 would do an ICO and have their own token.  So yeah...if it ever releases, it will have zero impact on the Bitcoin price.

I think he's referring to a full audit of all Fed dealings, not just an accounting audit.  For example, they regularly have secret dealings with international banks and aren't required to disclose anything to the public.

Except the Fed is not a part of the Federal Government, and their job is not to engage in international relations.  They are a private institution that was granted extraordinary banking powers by the Federal Reserve Act.  If they wish to keep this power, shouldn't they be accountable to the people?

@_date: 2016-02-19 15:35:27
Your response is a red herring.  I'm not talking about interest rate policy.  I'm talking about secret backdoor dealings with foreign banking institutions.  The Fed is not supposed to be having these meetings, but they do whatever they want with impunity because they can.  Furthermore, allowing the public to see what they are doing doesn't mitigate their independence.  This is just another fallacious defense the Fed uses all the time so they can remain secretive.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:13:25




Good luck with that
@_date: 2016-02-19 16:20:29
Maybe you don't find that important, but I would wager that a lot of people (both in the public and in government) would.  How will we ever know what they are doing if it's secret?  Your argument in favor of Fed secrecy makes no sense, and it's obvious that nobody is going to change your mind.  I'm done with this conversation, this is like arguing with a wall.

The only problem with this is that the bills could be forged easily.  That being said, I love the use of "bits" as a unit and think the community needs to make this shift.
@_date: 2016-10-08 02:13:26
I've been advocating this position for a long time, people on this sub are generally not receptive to the idea. I think if everyone started using "bits" as the primary reference point for price (or some other small unit of BTC) more people would want to buy in. "I can get 10,000 bits for only $1? Nice I'm in" this is how most people think.
@_date: 2016-10-14 05:25:21
Financial advice is a giant echo chamber. Nobody knows what the future holds, but everyone is comfortable parroting the same advice.  No professional will ever tell you to invest in Bitcoins, but that doesn't necessarily make it a crazy idea.    That being said, don't put all your eggs in one basket.

He has created a layer over Bitcoin (similar to the Lightning network) which will manage Bitcoin micro-transactions "off chain."  So the quote you pasted is primarily saying he doesn't want to record every micro-transaction separately on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Kim has gone on record saying that MU2 will ONLY use Bitcoin, and no other alt coins.  Period.

@_date: 2016-07-08 17:56:50
I think the main reason is due to there not being an upper limit on the quantity of coins.  I have tried and failed to understand how Ethers are mined and how many there will eventually be.  With Bitcoin, the upper 21M limit means there is an actual scarcity of coins.  This is similar to why previous metals have sustaining value, and why the US dollar does not.
