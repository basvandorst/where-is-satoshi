I just sent $12,000 in BCH, transaction fee $0.04. Confirmed in next block.
Would like to transfer BTC, but they're on non-segwit addresses, &amp; I can't justify the expense of moving them.
Are we certain increasing the blocksize isn't a solution?

I think it said in the white paper it was a currency.
Up until this past year it was a currency.
Transactions were quick and cheap.
How is that a bad thing?

I'll agree, we don't want a hardfork every other weekend. I'm not sure a 16MB wouldn't be a good solution for next 4 or 5 years. Perhaps its time to revive the dynamic scaling proposal. Every solution will have a downside,  but doing nothing will certainly kill BTC.
BCH seems to chug along nicely on 8 MB. LN appears to be vapourware, but even if it does make an appearance, I think alot of people will need a lot convincing to hand over their coins to unknown 3rd party.  For myself, I think I'd rather transact with another coin

Unless I misunderstand LN, I will have to put some BTC in escow in order to open a channel, or have I got the bull by the udder?

But I want to use BTC to transact, that's what its intended purpose was, that's why we all bought into it in the first place. Krugerrands are a store of value, but a terrible medium of exchange (even though it's legal tender in South Africa). BTC was supposed to be both. What's wrong with another hard fork to 16MB, or even 32MB? All software solutions are short term. JM Keynes: "in the long run, we are all dead"

I've quit accepting BTC in my business, &amp; switched to BCH. Customers seem happy with the decision. Fees as low as $0.01 confirm in the next block. I think customers are happy using BCH as many received it when it forked, you can buy on nearly every exchange, and maybe an irrational psychological advantage of buying a whole coin for less money. Not trying to shill for BCH, but BTC became unuseable for me

I don't know what the maximum size of a block should be, but I'm pretty sure it should be bigger than 1 meg. Bitcoin Cash is chugging alone nicely with 8 meg blocks.
I can't use bitcoin any more, the fees are too high. I've got a transaction that's been stuck for 10 days now, and I'm just going to wait for it to drop out of the mempool.
I'd like to move some bitcoin to another wallet, but the fees would wipe most of it out. We were promised that Segwit would solve most of these problems, but fees and transaction times are now much worse since the soft fork. We're told LN will fix everything, but considering the failure of Segwit, I remain extremely sceptical, and so far it's been vaporware.
I don't care about the Jihad between Bitcoin Cash &amp; Core. I just know I loved Bitcoin, but I can no longer use it to donate to deserving webpages or youtube videos.
Like my Krugerrands (which are legal tender), my bitcoins must gather dust until I decide to sell them to a greater fool

As exchanges also deal in fiat, it was prudent to take a very strict AML/KYC position. Many Gov'ts &amp; financial institutions still want to shut BTC down. The exchanges can now claim that they're clean as as whistle, &amp; DEA should take their investigations elsewhere. 
Coinbase put up a good fight against IRS, but it was a fight they were doomed to lose. 
Decentralized exchanges might be the way to go

Here's a good page for anyone contemplating bitcoin mining:
A short summary, it basically says you will spend a lot of time and money to break even (maybe about a year), at which time your equipment will probably become obsolete

1st thing you need to know about bitcoin mining is, unless you have
1) free or dirt cheap electricity
2) alot of $$$ to buy alot of mining machines
 don't go into bitcoin mining. You'll lose money if you do.
Bitcoin mining is an arms race against those who already have the above items
