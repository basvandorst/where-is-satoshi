As someone who is massively into Bitcoin but not American. I find it amazing that a single American with and education and and conscious would vote republican. I would usually vote centre left in the UK. I consider the democrats to be right wing and the Rebuplicans to be far right. No idea why you Americans don't have any mainstream centrist or leftwing politicians.

Try buying a house and explaining to your solicitor that you sold some Bitcoins on Bisq a P2P trading site that has no KYC forms. The response was. How much did you sell on there? Less than £10,000 is ok otherwise I am reporting you for suspicious activity. And none of the money that you gained from those transactions can be put towards that house purchase.

Hold on, I am a long term HODLer but this doesn't ring true to me. You mention that you are UK based, bank transfers in the UK are instantaneous using faster payments (I'm thinking up to £10,000) and totally free. What's more unlike in many other countries UK customers can have free bank accounts, and the majority of customers do have it. Now try withdrawing £10,000 from any Bitcoin exchange and see how long it takes you to arrive in your bank account. It can be 30 mins later but only if you have gone through 6 weeks of verification and checks, and already made smaller withdrawals etc.

As others have said and you have realised. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. You couldn't afford to loose more so you sold out. I was 90% down after 6 months, I just wrote off my loss in my head. It was a big loss but it didn't stop me from living normally as I only spent my investment fund that I had saved up. I sold my Bitcoin last year to buy a house, so HODling did actually work!
