for clarification we simply wanted to avoid this skyhook machine after the other skyhooks were not functional with thier individual issues. We were on a time very short time table and were done wasting time on them. It is possible this on that table was functional. the one we had on our private network would error out even when our connection was solid. 
freezing on QR scans was common. (requiring reboot)
displaying errors randomly was common.
to sum it up it simply this was a substandard product that needs work.
It looks much simpler mechanically and something i would love to endorse but i personally cant do that at the moment.
this table was the furthest from where we started so we went right to the lamassu

I wish I had taken up ballroom dance 10 years prior.  It's always a taco fest.  I get laid daily with very few exceptions.  I see other guys join and hook up all the time for both sex but also true love.  The best part is even if it doesn't work out with a chick. She would never be able to take away the skill......  Which other chicks really dig.  Btw I'm late 20s so don't think I'm an old fart or anything.  Trust me I'm an introverted shy with the ladies guy that could not dance to save my life and it scared the shit out of me.     Now I'm a dancing polygamist fool. You don't have to believe me of you don't want to.  But trust me you won't have a heavy heart because you will redirect your attention to dancing and the chicks will come to you.  It's way easier when your not looking for it.

How I read this is that someone was trying to alert the outside world that people using coinbase can expect an audit. targeting just a few thousand people.
The leaking of the email and names while suffering collateral damage which such was the only practical way of proving the validity of the info. This has more to do about the FEDs eyes then the list of leaks.
Morality can be debated on the methods used here. but It is clear what they are trying to communicate without breaking their gag order.

good thoughts. and by no means do I intend on misinforming. this is not meant to be a white paper or an software tech paper. its just a summary for newbs to start with
theoretical destruction is not applicable for purposes of this paper. 99.99% resiliency is good enough for people to buy something on overstock.
I maintain that physics is applicable in many senses from thermodynamics to just mathematical truths. I did change the word to "logic". thank for the input
the peers(miners maintain the ledger) the clients do not. I didn't feel the need to go into the facets and specifics here. Wording this in a way for people to understand is tricky but i welcome any suggestions you may have on phrasing.
it is only inflationary if the rate of creation exceeds the rate of destruction or removal of use. by accident or on purpose as well as from deaths of persons.   The debate on how to measure this is not solvable. in the long run the majority can agree that it is a matter of time if not already that it becomes deflationary. the factor of past or possible current inflation is a minuscule factor in the current price.  This comes down to relevancy to individual as well as market effect.
So While your point is well take this extra information is not likely to be relevant at all to the user. 
I agree on the sudo anon part. a person will either understand i2p and tor or not... in most cases not.  A person will say to them selves. "I have no idea what or how to use those. thus it is non anon".... but i think i will change the wording to be more truthful. i thank you input is valuable.
let me know when email becomes prevalent :D
I might change wording however to make you feel better about it

he meant simply by the coins being mined at a very specified rate. 
in the short term they are inflationary in the physical sense. 
from the economic sense it does not mater as the market knows that this will eventually fall below the rate of which coins are permanently removed from circulation. Thus it is treated as deflationary because that event is a certainty despite its timing is not being certain.
Its one of those things a person can be both right and wrong on.

not a fear monger. i own a lot* of bitcoin its in my interest to see glaring holes fixed not ignore them. 
I never implied it was an attack. I implied centralization which requires a level of trust in a few entities. That is not an attack that is disruptive to fungibility. 
And I did point out that mining operations under control of a single entity is not likely now* "sure its not practical in today"
I still see no reason why a person with deep pockets can manufacture asic chips from their own factory and build a massive farm. sure its more money then you and i have as individuals but its still possible by a corporation and or government (more so buy a government).

concern(sizable %,perhaps still not majority) vs actual problem(minority)
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:01:03
no the majority are not forced* to do their work.  Sex work is one of the most common profession and even though some are under bad circumstances, most situations are considered an honest method of work depending on the social/economic condition of the area.
no two people are under the same exact situation. but that doesnt matter because Its not about an individual.
By providing financial options gives them much more freedom rather then sign themselves into contracts etc... because of limited choices or by what other situation they are in.
Choices and control over own finances allows all said workers (female and male) oppressed or not a better quality of life and more upward mobility in social/economic status no matter what area of the world they are in.
A credit union and market place for sex workers to operate in is only the start.
no need to worry about having to hide wads of dollars large and small to be robbed where ever they sleep. The demand for pimps becomes reduced If the worker can work for them selves. 
Sexworker lobby(yes there is an acutall lobby) will have a better chance at overturning prostitution laws by large scale organized efforts.
this domino effect has a huge butterfly effect. workers can report crimes without fear of incriminating themselves. much of the abuse that does occur against these people is caused by their inability to defend themselves legally... or financially if not by a physical method of defense.
Imagine a crime is committed against you and you can not go to the police for help.  In many cases this is a form of mental abuse worse then some of the original crime. It makes you feel less then human or less worthy of social standing in the worst possible way.
by providing at least a barrier to theft and access to financial flexibility normal people get from a credit union as well as legal network it will help. It wont solve all the issues but its a start.

the owner may or may not have direct control of the company's direction and or goals.
also 25million is pocket change.
right now they are selling a product that  as much as i personally want it, it simply does not exist nor is there anything to lead me to believe it ever will. A resume dose not change that. perhaps a proposal as to how this is beneficial for a processor to carry might* lend some credibility in the absence proof of a real deal.(sound proposal and or* proof of product is what gets me to invest in something)

Important things to know:
1. Start Slow  Research and start with small amounts.
2. As an investment be conservative never risk what you are not willing to lose. 
3. The exchanges are open 24 hours a day. They never close for holidays and they never sleep.
4. Only you are responsible for the security of your assets. No FDIC insurance
5. Never keep money on any exchange unless intended for active trading. Too big to fail does not exist!
6. Never keep more on a phone than you would have cash in your wallet. Phones can be stolen or lost.
7. Never take Paypal or Credit card for bitcoin. They are reversible, bitcoins are not. Possibility for scam.
8. Long term storage of bitcoin wallets should be offline such as a paper wallet and placed in a safe/vault. 
9. Withdraw entire balances from paper wallets.  keep transactions to paper wallets to a minimum.
10. Paper Wallet Alternatives include tokens from: bitcointrezor.com(electronic) or casascius.com(brass)
11. Bitcoins can be signified as BTC(informal) or XBT(ISO 4217). 
12. Apple is hostile to Bitcoin apps use Android or the “web based” apps to get around the blockade
13. Common myth explanations can be found here: en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Myths
14. Stay ahead of the news: reddit.comcoindesk.com		bitcoinmagazine.com
Where to put bitcoin:
* Large sums on paper wallets and into a physically safe place.
* Small sums on a phone wallet ideal for daily commerce
* Medium sums on a web wallet ideal for online shopping.
The 4 ways to acquire Bitcoin are:
1. Sell/Barter something for bitcoins			 		(simplest, 1 step)
2. Trade/Buy on a web based currency exchange			(moderate effort)
3. Tip/Gift donation directly to your wallet 				(requires karma)
4. Mining aka contributing processing power to the community ledger 	(technical)

if bitcoin is displacing bhat then by definition its becoming more obsolete. even if by only small percentages.
another point is that has been brought up. many currencies use the $ but the confusion is minor because humans have the ability to adapt and can be conscience of context. even when two countries like USA$(USD) and mexico$(peso) are used in close proximity.(and in larger qtys then bhat vs btc)
The postings I have seen from bitcoiners in Thailand also confirm this.

the best response so far.
 however what if in said scenario they take control of the hashing power and don't do any evil. no one forks just a few noisy complaints. merchants wont care because thats business as usually and the miners would not have any incentive to leave. but you still have the problem of a single entity in control of the until it no longer is in vuge for miners to participate. people will become complacent to a all knowing government tha is filtering out bad transactions 50years down the line. average joe dont care, he just wants his beer and foot ball commingling in.... this s the same issue with the federal reserve. most people dont simply care.

The point of this one is to target the largest under represented demographic in bitcoin circles. women being the largest minority.

I think you are ignoring the gender inequality in bitcoin circles.  Sure there are exceptions.  But pretending that they are not under represented will not help.  Bitcoin is for everyone and a lot of information is written in a male centric point of view only because they overwhelming are over represented.   I do want all the other groups of people you mentioned targeted too with additional outreach.  But for now there needs to be outreach to the 51% of the population that is not being represented.  
I think you should point out ways this document could be better (productive)  rather then focus on the title.

he did express interest in continuing contact directly with the lamassu guys for some future projects, if that pans out who knows. but i think he was happy with his experience with it.
BTW he is extremely well versed on the ALTs and would not surprise me if hes lurking on here a lot with his level of knowledge topics of discussion as well as his own very well thought out and intelligent ideas.
He also sees FIAT as 100% doomed to be replaced by crypto (most likely bitcoin)

@_date: 2015-05-12 14:47:28
rate of creation is 99% certain. you are technically right about a future generation updating the core to change the coinbase reward.its just not likely as economic incentives deter it.
supply however is not mathematically verifiable....
As i pointed out earlier coins get lost all the time for various reasons. its completely not measurable. 
There is no way to determine if a coin is lost or just being sat on by an earlier adopter.
there also will not be a mass dumping of earlier adopters. 
there are two camps of thinking when for the people the hlod that both make mass dumping not practical.
1. as you sell coins on the exchange the supply on the exchange increases and the price drops. there is a economic incentive to prevent mass dumping like that for a single person and with groups of larger earlier adopters you see the spread even further.
Any bearwhales become temporary anomalies as  no single person has the market cornered.
2.  [This pic sums it up](
Velocity on the exchanges is one of the few indicators* of the exchange rate even though it has no relationship to supply/demand.  
Hence pick your crystal ball of choice.

that is explained in the 102 doc.  deflation is when destruction exceeds creation either by design or not people dying lost keys etc...
Since its not possible to measure but we all can agree will happen at one time we can consider it deflationary now, because even current the speculation is based on this happening. The whole point is to not get into economic theory with a newb. Hopefully these papers will get them started. after which it can be assumed they will do further research... and ultimately weather or not its truly deflationary today is really not important.
But you do make a good point
@_date: 2014-05-06 11:01:24
i think we are mostly on the same page... however to me ball is in marks court to prove otherwise. Even though those people were dumb asses and sending in money to a failing exchange (or had automatic money transfers in place) they still took that money and did not return it. They must prove that money was spent/stolen/stored if they do not return it.

A company putting thier own shirt in the game on the spread works out as long as there is competition.  There is much to loose as well as make when placing a stake on the spread.  You have to think hard on which side of spread trades they are on.  This is why there is no centralisation on the exchange.  Competition will keep balance and place thier rates in check.  If they profit well it's not up to us to decide the morality unless there was a monopoly which is impossible unless they use government regulations to push out competition.
