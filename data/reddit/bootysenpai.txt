Alrighty not helping..
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:14:06
Woah red alert man. Calm down. I haven't been hacked but the shady activity around me revealing any type of information on the internet made me realize how easy it would be to hack someone who is even more of an internet novice than me. I love bitcoin with a passion but I dont want people falling into some easy hacking tricks by the people who don't care. You seemed to have me pegged as someone who is getting a welfare check. I've been at work since you replied to me try again mate.

One big problem is that when you tip on twitter it looks like one of those Account take over scams.. Especially when change tip says follow me….
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:35:52
best answer take a mint candy on me. @_date: 2014-11-19 11:33:55
This is a perfect opportunity. Especially under 400$. Tim Draper wants to buy them like the last batch he bought about around 500-600$. If I could by Government cleaned decentralized currency I would be bidding just as hard as Draper. His coins are honestly worth more to investors who are intrigued about bitcoin but dont like the sketchyness or lack of regulation. Having the Government seal of approval brings much value to these coins.
@_date: 2014-11-09 23:22:18
People probably trying to get in before holiday season (Bitcoin discounts) . I know I did.
@_date: 2014-11-24 01:52:35
I heard that the blockchain isn't ready for X amount of transactions. Maybe Sakamoto is keeping it down till it's ready.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:53:10
Go and comment your feelings to them. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 00:14:18
haha the good ol days. It makes you think how far will we be in 3 more years.
@_date: 2014-11-16 12:36:56
If someone is telling you no. That's a lie. It will more than likely rise just like BTC value rose on Singles day in China..
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:26:43
hold for now and see where its at by the end of tomorrow, a lot of fuzzy speculation is going on right now that the price may jump heavy
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:35:40
heard 47%
@_date: 2014-12-27 01:17:02
Make sense from a man who likes to have a grasp of things before investing in something
@_date: 2014-11-12 02:26:20
Well thank you for spreading the joy mate enjoy your metals

You go buy bitcoin and spread the love. But make sure to learn as much as possible about it first.
@_date: 2014-11-24 14:54:45
Just human nature, I respect the advice but some people really are affected by the price. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:33:48

The cool part is that its 10 cents now while bitcoin is valued at 374$ but it could be much much more in about 24 hours. Enjoy.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:23:54
alright man good luck!

@_date: 2014-11-12 22:48:21
dude its fucking true this is manipulation at its best....they are just manipulating till the hype train comes. Than they can really play.
@_date: 2014-11-12 01:21:51
Anyone seeing these buy orders on the bitcoin ticker??
@_date: 2014-12-04 16:33:02
Try Circle.com
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:15:00
All I read was you Bitcoiners don't know how to run politics. Pretty deep, I'm not going to act like I completely understood any of it but it seems WU is dropping the HAMMA.
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:19:00
Bro honestly I would relax on the deal. If something of value is coming off with red alerts!! then back the fuck out and find someone else, no need to risk over greed. You have plenty of time to sell your stuff
@_date: 2014-11-11 01:34:12
I would man tomorrow might be a big day.
@_date: 2014-12-13 03:24:09
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:26:16
I agree with the post mainly because when ever I see someone crying for help on r/bitcoin most of the post have like 10 you should of tried harder and 1 actually helpful response. 
Its like most people on here just want new users to adopt bitcoin to just raise the price but anything beyond that its like your on your own or "y u so dumb"
@_date: 2014-10-04 17:20:54
Set your last resort low, if the price of bitcoin drops to it get out but if it doesn't ride it out for about a month or 2. Atleast thru Shopping season and see how that goes.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:43:54
Just wait for actual adoption! turtle race no more trying to make them rabbit bucks. 
One thing that can give you what you want is a country advocating the use of bitcoin versus their currency. like mega adoption some where like china level.
Or china being able to fully use bitcoin freely and reopening the gates go bitcoin over there
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:42:19
Have a candy on me mate! @_date: 2014-11-19 11:43:47

He was our voice for Bitcoin for that particular moment and the ladies there laughed him off the stage...not cool
@_date: 2014-12-06 19:03:58
When I did a reddit search for Bitcoin hacking most of the post for hacks coming from Coinbase were 5+ months ago having to do with the API button.
Now for Blockchain wallet hacking stories all recent and growing more and more every other day.
I was concerned honestly for new users myself. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 17:29:36
I can agree with this to a degree. All in good time.
@_date: 2014-11-15 21:14:45
10 out of fucking 10. I posted that Bitcoin was being manipulated but people either didn't want to accept it or they were trying to shoo me under the rug. I love Bitcoin with a passion but seeing it catch the group of "Weak hands" makes me a bit mad. OP If I didn't have to give out free bitcoin to my class on monday, you'd get my biggest tip ever on here. Remind me I owe you one m8!  great post and follow up.
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:55:23
hahaha I couldn't agree more. China trying to disrupt the world one takeover at a time eh?
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:18:03
Why do they do this to my poor poor heart...
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:13:07
Dude I knew I added you as a friend for some reason! Bet we see you do something big sooner or later man. Good fucking luck. Soon you might find your self the richest man in the world good luck to you mate! Keep me updated I might be following your path when I find a good job entry level job (still in college years)

This is craZIIII
@_date: 2014-11-10 17:23:20
Okay, well all I'm doing is spreading awareness about guiding the new people you bring into bitcoin a bit more than just saying," go Coinbase buy and profit" your obviously mad or trolling or have some other motive but have a nice day. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 00:32:32
Thanks much love.
@_date: 2014-11-12 19:38:02
Smart man! this post needs to be stickied. Before we hear cries of the sheep. Take a candy on me! @_date: 2014-12-03 21:03:34
I have sinned. I have lost my teachings. I shall mold my self into a true Bitcoiner and shall achieve Moonment.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:47:57
Cant Have something that can disrupt 10 different markets right in front of me and not want to invest in it. 
Then I find out you can without all that wall street bull shit. I'm crying everyday at this opportunity. Moon or bust It was a good fucking ride.
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:55:53
wow these mofuxers.......just to funny. 
Bet you these companies could make a situation where you cheating on your loyal girlfriend was entirely her fault.
@_date: 2014-11-18 15:28:20
Bro Was underfire. Handled this like a boss!
@_date: 2014-10-08 14:21:14
I honestly almost cried "No troll" that was beautiful. I see the engines moving for bitcoin more and more every day. Glad to be apart of bicoin's short, mid, and long term success.

good stuff!
@_date: 2014-12-06 23:33:43
Honestly I see it as these merchants being Early adopters and as bitcoin becomes bigger those places that adopted will get customers first. Nothing really changes after a merchant accepts bitcoin it just opens them up to a new channel of consumers. In time they will benefit first.
@_date: 2014-11-09 01:03:19
Just tipped Kanye!!!
@_date: 2014-11-25 04:30:07
A clap for you sir.
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:32:02
Thanks mate ill throw one up for you
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:47:19
Hmm interesting. Thats kind of ironic because gift cards should be in the same field as virtual currencies so any bans or barriers should also have to restrict gift cards.
@_date: 2014-10-06 21:06:01
@_date: 2014-11-09 14:19:38
First thing first changetip tips has to look less like a scam also before this can get extremely big. The fact that it says come follow me is….people don't trust links at all
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:16:17
Think it went well. What we wanted kind of a let us grow but help keep consumers safe approach. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 22:45:53
Hey, this correlates with my story. I tipped a person I know in real life on twitter and shes semi twitter famous but I know her personally as a friend. So I  tip her she asks whats this and I'm like bitcoin/free money go head and collect it. She says "No thanks to sketchy" I then relized changetipping on twitter looks like a big scam that takes over a users account. Which is really big on twitter. I know relize that we must tip an amount that they cant turn away from even if it looks scammy.
@_date: 2014-12-27 00:14:13
interesting thanks for the post
@_date: 2014-12-03 20:51:10
Brother give me your hand.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:27:29
well speculation buying could raise it a bit like it did last night
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:54:53
nice have a mint candy on me
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:10:39
Its not hard to understand. Say I post something here that connects me to another account somewhere else. Then hacker goes looking for info to help him crack my password. If good enough good chance of cracking. I know alot of people who just add random people for no reason on FB
@_date: 2014-12-07 04:15:55
Well go have fun with the money. We all knew the risks when tipping, be it a real post or not. NBD. Nothing to see here.
@_date: 2014-11-14 00:37:52
Idk I say your keep half and use the other half to become our bitcoin Santa Clause. Think that would be fun and timely for the holidays. Start with this thread and spread the love. Also congrats. Btw what made you quit second life?

This and This again. Before any of you new users touch the buy button on a Bitcoin learn as much as possible! Good post. 
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:15:13
I will not lie, I know nothing beyond the market and it saddens me. Miners give off a majority type of vibe tbh.
"You know nothing Jon Snow"
@_date: 2014-11-24 02:16:39
Makes sense. I wonder how long till all the old miners or people who had a lot of bitcoin will leave the market.
@_date: 2014-11-10 10:06:28
Nice!! link!! Upvote for you! take a mint candy on me @_date: 2015-01-01 19:22:37

sic wid it.
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:40:28
This literally needs to be sticked for the fact it's a real time example of what happens when the average user is rushed into Bitcoin and what Backpage saw that could make bitcoin better. Needs more upvotes good post m8.
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:34:43
I like what someone said earlier in this thread. Coinbase may not be the best but it's the most practical. There are alot of companies that might be the best at something but that doesn't mean they're the most popular. Great post man I came to this realization a while ago and I'm biding my time in the Bitcoin world till adoption is easier or the world becomes more tech savvy and then IM ALL IN!
@_date: 2015-07-16 02:54:43
Not to be a dick, but maybe because I've been dirt poor. Sometimes it's called sacrifice. I know people will flame me like Grrrrr they shouldn't have to do this or that but it seems like they need to do some financial planning and oraninzie their needs vs their wants.
 1. they were on the internet, which costs money.....
2. cut down on the groceries.....
3. granted stuff they need and fixed costs but if you have a person dying right in front of you and you risk further getting into trouble and putting that loved one in more pain then idk...if it was worth it.
4 again  you might flame me like they shouldn't have to to this or blah blah but....I'll use an example in some poor communities with the fact that people are buying 200 dollar weaves and 600 dollar shoes but are on foodstamps...just my honest opinion and yes I do understand but uping the dark net when your can just cut down luxuries and sacrifice when you need to just seems meh to me. YEA I KNOW FUCK THE GOVERNMENT THEY SHOULDN'T NEED TO Blah blah but be a little more realistic guys...
