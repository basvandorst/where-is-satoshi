Felix Salmon continues to 'get it' as far as I'm concerned. I continue to connect with many of the points he's made recently. Previous article by Salmon, [The Satoshi Paradox](

You seem to really be stuck on this, eh gamercoin? Did you even read the original article? 20 Mission is a shared community building under renovation by young professionals. I've been there for an event - great spot, with common areas similar to those found in buildings housing startup companies. They accept btc (do you really think crackhouses are accepting btc?).
It seems the location was neglected for some time and so squatters took over. All of that has been cleaned up and the building is going through a big renovation, all the while a couple of dozen young professionals choose to live there (mostly 20-something men in the tech industry). 
Chickens on the roof? I have several friends that enjoy raising chickens and have coops on their roof or in their garden; it's not an uncommon urban development here in San Francisco.
Communal bathrooms and showers? You seem to think that means people are forced shower together, and that's just foolish. Have you ever lived in a home with roommates and shared bathrooms? It's the same thing... and as the renovation continues 20 Mission will be building out more bathrooms and showers.
She could have remained in her place - it came across to me that she didn't completely move out, just moved for a night or two - however, she choose to move to 20 Mission as part of the experiment and in keeping with the spirit of living solely on btc for a week.
edit: spelling
EDIT2: Ah, I see **gamercoin** is a 0 day old Reddit account, a 0 day account that keeps pimping the billpayforcoins site.

So you totally missed the *former* crackhouse part? 20 Mission is shared community living space (a very common and popular living situation in San Francisco) currently undergoing renovations by young professionals. You also missed the can't-use-billpayforcoins part because her landlord is in Brazil and mailed check payment is not an option.

Very cool. These guys camped with us at Burning Man in 2012.

[XKCD]( seems to think not.
