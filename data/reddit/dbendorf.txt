My post asked two questions.  It actually included no information.

You uh, replaced "Peter Todd" with "shibonimonkey."  I think you were doing a poor copy/paste job, as your comment was exactly the same as your other comment...

Dude, what are you talking about?  I said nothing about Todd.  How am I being dishonest?

Is this the right way to disclose security vulnerabilities?  Did you contact the Bitcoin Unlimited team before disclosing this?

Isn't it the same code as the Mike Tyson wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-28 03:08:15
But honestly-- who uses Samurai wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:20:10
My bad, that wallet was based on BitPay.  No code from Tyson, just branding with his name on a bitcoin wallet

So you use alpha software for... currency?

The changes would make their nodes ban their own nodes?  Feel insulted all you want, but Core 0.15 actively bans nodes that run another implementation of bitcoin because of "consensus issues."  If that in itself is not a consensus issue, then there seems to be a consensus issue.

Bro, ethereum is not a currency.  Comparing apples and oranges.
