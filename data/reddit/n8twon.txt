I don't know about for the price. What effects the price the most is more money coming in and the miners floor. 
@_date: 2018-09-22 13:34:32
It was right after the last halving then, and nothing is happening now. The price changes will be marginal at best unless that ETF is approved.

I've convinced mining farms to keep their miners on by saying "but a miners got to mine". They pause and then come back to me with yeah you're right. No one in the history of bitcoin looks back over a 2 year period and says "damn, I should of stopped mining".

I haven't  been using reddit for a long time. I didn't really become obsessed with crypto until bitcoin hit $2000. I freaked out at $10,000. I got sober at $15,000. I had a really good year. But my overall experience with reddit has been over the top censorship. I came here to post a old horror story on some sub that my buddy asked me to share and it was deleted immediately. True story too. 
Anyways I had to go to pretty crappy subs to get my karma up. Just to contribute. I really enjoy the subs I subscribe to now. I have posted some comments when I didn't know better, that were taken down. I got it figured out now. I come to r/bitcoin to talk about bitcoin. I subscribe to r/btc too but I rarely get involved. 
I think Ver is a very smart guy and I have personally purchased a few asics with his brand playing around. I'll just be honest and let you know I am completely 100% sold on bitcoin and bitcoin alone and I respect this sub for what it is. I would hate for the trolls on btc to ruin my fun here.
I vote to keep it as is. My hats off to this beautiful sub.

You have to use your resources. I learned a lot when I got taken to Progressive Insurance computer bunker. You aren't allowed to take phones in. The engineering was flawless.

It usually takes a few months past the halving to grow and take account for scarcity. So 2020 is very important too. I'm 100% on it  being a minimum of 6 figures by 2021, could be more. 
Just like the halving of 2016.

I live in WV. I am personally working with companies and individuals that I submitted a concept for "proof of work energy conversion", it has been proven. We have tons of coal and extremely cheap to free natural gas. My family's property has deeded free natural gas. I'm trying to find other miners with capital to invest with me, I have the free gas. We can scale and convert it until our hearts are content. If you want to really make a lot of money and have some capital. I have the best spot in the world to mine. I have a handful of other properties of people that I am close with, with similar or identical rights. The opportunity is still ripe for the picking. I was contacted by another person this evening with the same rights that would like to move forward. The first person that actually move forward with me will revolutionize the industry. You will ROI in the first 6 months and own the best mining opportunity in the world. We will scale and take over the market shares available. We will make millions. It is coming.

My Dad stores his bitcoin on coinbase, one of the safer options when it comes to exchanges. I try to tell him to move his saving bitcoin to another wallet. The one thing I learned very early on was people are after my bitcoin. Better learn what you are doing quickly.

That's why you convert your own electricity from natural gas and other cheap energy. Gas companies sell their gas for $2 a mcf. We can convert it and mine for over $25 a mcf. Creating these electrical generated infrastructures will give us complete freedom from grids.

I didn't get to sell it then, they shut it down.
I've since sold and bought back in a few times and made some sweet gains. I dumped all my alts at this point. I have about 20 bucks worth of dust. I sold my bnb yesterday. So the only thing I have now is bitcoin. When my equihash miners come in I'll have some zec, but I'll convert that to bitcoin daily and hold on for dear life.

I was pretty glum when I was buying on the way down from 6500 to 3100.... I had a few racks put up for the right time and bought at 5k. Then it hit 4k and didnt have any more money that I was willing to spend (excluding the .02 btc I buy weekly).
I got my dad to buy in at 4k though so he's happy. And I'm pretty happy I got in at 5k.
Honestly, in 1 year anyone that got in under 10k is going to look pretty good. Under 10k is gonna look like the bottom after the Great Halvening.

Honestly, I was waiting for a dip from that 6700 spot we were at last year. I widened my position on the way down at around 5k.
Then it dropped to 3k I about shit..... but I held and bought more. 
I was hoping that price would hit 10k before the halving. Then here we are..... I'm extremely pleased. I actually said.... I hope the price levels out at around 10k.
I'm still expecting a 6 figure bitcoin at some point in 2021.

I actually bought a bunch of miners with bcash. Then they slammed me over there when I was a noob here and didnt know the lingo on the subs. It drove me away pretty quick.
I think this feud is stupid. It's funny, but it does get old. 
It has to be disheartening this time around that bcash didnt go back to 1200 bux.
I really think Roger is a smart guy, I thought he was backing off the feud. Then I saw him talking about getting bitcoin dropped from some debit card service.
Then I was like "that mothetfucker better quit attacking my baby" and posted a bcash joke on Twitter. Then I got banned from Twitter, got reinstated.
Now I'm here, talking shit. But it's the truth. I've tried to reason with them, they are a spiteful bunch. I haven't given up hope, yet, but I'm almost  there.

No, I dont have any suggestions about that.
I've been fucking with bitcoin for a while. I just want more and more of it. I'm not really shaken up by the volatility anymore.
I've lived a pretty reckless life, done some extreme things.
I feel at this point I know more about bitcoin, insurance and real estate than anything. I value my bitcoin more so than anything else I invest in. 
I'll be alright if bitcoin goes to $1000. I don't think that is possible though.... 
I do t have a healthy balance of anything in life. I go to two 12 step meetings a day. If I like something it turns into a problem. The first time I got clean I had a bitcoin left over from the dream market. So while I was struggling with that, and only allowed to make phone calls out. I got to watch that shit moon. 
So when I was at my lowest bitcoin was one of my only things that made me happy. So when I got cleaned up I spent that bitcoin on some asics and started allocating a little weekly into buying it.
To say I'm completely sold on this shit is an understatement. I love it. I have a good job, but bitcoin is my favorite.   :)
@_date: 2018-07-16 01:38:47
We were all kids once playing with new tech. It was harmless.

The profits completely depend on how cheap your electricity is. At the current price it is basically a way to dollar cost average your purchases. You get a little bit of bitcoin everyday. 
I dont sell my bitcoin, so there are no profits at this point. 
I mine and buy bitcoin every week.
I know you're not supposed to have all your eggs in one basket. But I do. I am completely sold on bitcoin. It's one of my favorite things on the planet.
I understand insurance and bitcoin. I love taking apart the miners and working on them. I love fucking with the settings. It's fascinating to me.
I'm one of those "silk road idiots", I got clean and now I fuck with bitcoin.
People in my area literally call me Bitcoin. Like "what's up bitcoin". I say stupid shit like "staying sober, getting bitcoin".

I'm in West Virginia still. I do insurance and real estate work. I've been in the same line of business since I was 19. I'm 37 now. I'd have to message you. When you've done the same line of work that I have and have basically maxed out the potential for the size of the population it feels stagnant. I'm a bit tired of loss ratios and tenants. Yeah it pays the bills and I am thankful, but this is where it's at.

Bitcoin is a deflationary currency that is guaranteed to go up in value over time. It's a perfect design. 
The next halving will bring us to 6 figures. It will go higher than that too. 
You should definitely position yourself for short term gains. You should get at least 2 bitcoins to sit on for a 2025 hold.

I'd go weekly on Coinbase and just buy at the opportune time during the week to avoid the fees..
But yes, I would drop the 60 bux on the dip and adjust my buy schedule accordingly. I'd also have a few k set aside for a major purchase if the price we to dip a few thousand or something.

Smart move. I agree
Property and bitcoin are the two safest bets right now.
I helped a man send $1200 dollars worth of bitcoin to China today. Usually he deals with banks. When he saw it was only pennies to send it and that it was permissionless he said "imagine what we could do with this about getting money into the mission trips we run. We have to bribe people to get our cash through their customs". This is life and death stuff for alot of people.
The applications are endless.

My father is in a unique position financially. He doesn't need the money. I, myself, have an exit strategy. But will never completely exit. I'll always stay in the 21 million club, I'd prefer to always remain in the 10 million club. But certain price levels, I'll exit most of my hodl position, I guess this depends as well.
We are still stacking before the halving over here. Him and I are keeping good pace with one another. He has more miners than I do, he also has a shit ton more of disposable income. We will throw around cash like its nothing. But we dont come off them satoshis very easy.

I dont think you are wrong assuming the valuations criteria. Depending on where you are in the world it applies in a much larger perception.
When bitcoin was hovering around 8500 or so I thought it was over valued a bit. I'm almost an evangelical type of believer in proof of work. Inside and outside of crypto. A worker is worth his wages to all degrees, even tractors with headlights.
I think the perceived value is fading and there is an agreed value with proof of work. Right now imo it is around 6700 and increasing daily with the difficulty.  
This will continue to draw it up as more miners come online and then the halving will hit which will spike it ridiculously.

Miners control the floor. What gives bitcoin value is scarcity and usefulness. The halving creates a huge increase in value. Similar to a buy back and burn. The 2016 halving is what caused 2017.
