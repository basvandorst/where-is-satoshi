We do have a lot in common, but the disregard for society that Austrian Economist have is, IMO, similar to the disregard for the individual that Marxists have.

So you are saying that people voluntarily not working isn't bad for the economy? People delayed their investment decisions isn't bad for the economy?

No, it doesn't. It does require the threat of force, otherwise you can simply not pay back the loan, but I can't see why it requires fractional reserve.
Example:

Of course it doesn't, because it is not relevant. himself_v never brought it up, you did...

P2P lending is perfectly possible.

See, we're actually agreeing now. Both small deflation and small inflation aren't that harmful. There might be hope for the world :)
Where we disagree is that:
1. I'd rather have the government watch out for the money supply and try to avoid both hyperdeflation and hyperinflation instead of having a fixed trend (that was defined at birth). Can they provoke hyperinflation instead of avoiding them? Absolutely. But I think we're doing a good job on that front (on developed countries).
2. I'd rather have a small inflation than a small deflation. It's a tax on wealth, and I'm cool with that. For me, it sends the right signal.

We could always ask the authorities to ban HFT in bitc... Oh, nevermind.

So say I'd be willing to hire you on a one year contract. What would be the wage you would accept (in BTC, obviously)?

Bullshit. The problem with deflation is that it is an incentive to reduce economic activity. That has absolutely nothing to do with the fractional reserve system. It's simple psychology: when you gain by doing nothing, you are incentivized to do nothing.


Bullshit. Fiat currency is divisible ad infinitum. You just make a law saying that currency is Y and it is worth 0.01 X. It's a simple split, and is enforced by law. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has a fixed number of decimal cases. At that point, money is not divisible anymore, and no one has the authority to just replace Bitcoins with another system. It will be Y2K all over again.

So you admit to being part of the 1%!

I agree with pretty much all you said. The USA has a really weird system, where private banks are given control over the currency. There's no question things could be improved.

I'll accept an Austrian Economics site as source once you accept Marxists as a source too, since they're equally as dumb.

I disagree completely, but there's no point in arguing. We have different values.
