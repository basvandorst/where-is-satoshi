if the deadline is the 7th....hasnt this already passed? Wouldnt we be getting flooded with people saying "I CANT WITHDRAW YUANS FOR MY BTC!!"??? Isnt it already the 9th or 10th in China?

Sigh...it says even in the post that they take BOTH btc and USD. I'm assuming most people who are buying bitcoin mining chips will probably pay in bitcoin, though it would be a decent hedge to pay in cash...
Not to mention they will be mining with these chips, right now they arent mining alot but you can bet that they will be with these new chips. Hopefully in the new cooling facilities
You can go both ways with this.... but I like devil's advocates

Negative - Asicminer is one of the competitors and should be rivaling their 20nm chips....
Also, its funny I remember when Cointerra first debuted - everyone was all over them because of their "high" knowledge in the asic field... A lot of good that did people who pre-ordered and got stuck with a machine that isnt up to specs....

How much of bitcoin is used in dark markets? Had a debate with a colleague saying that more than 50% was used but I let him know that I think it was much lower.
Is there any use for a regular person on the street to actually use bitcoin?

What is bitcoin going to start doing that "we" didnt expect?

Do you actually mine GrixM? Another question, do you know a lot about AM? It seems like you dont, they are releasing a V2 version of chips in the next few weeks. Also, while I agree with you that power consumption is very important - difficulty change is the greatest. I ask you if you mine because I do have my own hardware - it's not too bad but pending what you pay on your ASIC you may never actually get what you paid back for it. At least with AM shares if they go up, you get the dividends + the rising of shareprice.  
They are selling other things besides USB's - their Eruptor blades which hash at about 13GH/s. I think that they are one of the leading vendors in ASICs, Avalon is doing great while shipping their pre-orders and BFL seems to be getting there as well besides their very long wait. Thest rest of the companies you have named like KNC and Bitfury have yet to even send one order. 
EDIT: I own AM shares - bought shares at ~1BTC, havent pulled anything out and wont. AM is a fantastic company - Friedcat rules.
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:07:21
It's pretty crazy how quickly it took off.... I mean they were always pretty pricey but some of the pre-orders now are expensive. I dont know if I would pay thousands of dollars for a pre-order

Here is a picture of my chat history with a Customer support rep from Overstock... it looks like its true - or Arthur is in bigggg trouble!

Friedcat is a busy man - you cant expect him to announce every little detail. It must be hard enough working on keeping the TH constant, transferring shares, and keeping with future plans. I think that this is a definite good thing. I'd much rather have my divies cut a bit to ensure AM being a part of the gameplan in the future. 
The people who are selling off now are just panic selling. They look at the AM thread and see randoms posting ZOMG THE PRICE IS TANKING SELL SELL SELL SELL. All FUD. Simple as that - you shouldnt mind it at all, you're chance of picking up some real real cheap shares. There was a huge auction at 2.7 which sold a good bit of shares as well so looks like there will be a nice holding pressure at 2.7

almost 13GH/s? Mine get 13 :D

What if the price of BTC goes to 200, wouldnt techincally then the coins the people made be for profit?
@_date: 2013-07-01 00:24:12
k so I order my AM today, I get it in a week and start mining. I order my BFL and wait ???then I can start mining. You would still buy the BFL rig?
@_date: 2013-08-28 14:07:00
this starts in August - these are shipping now so you have one month to add on top of it. Not much of a ROI but still you get +

What's a bunch invested? :P
Think the chances of satoshi being NSA seems not very likely
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:38:59
I agree that its a bit silly - but I dont think that it should be taken away. I feel that they need to add the in the money section just like other trading sites do however this is YOUR own fault if you buy these options....take a little bit longer and a close look at what you're buying before you buy them.

if you dont know much about bitcoin...dont get mining equipment... sorry to be rude here but its one of those things that are very hard to keep up with. You could go for like 20k worth of eruptor blades but you may not make much profit. It maybe a much better idea to just buy bitcoins and sit on them.
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:03:48
Dem throwaways....
Yeah, always always always research the company you are buying into before actually dropping your coins.... I'm very very happy you made money on your shares - as a shareowner myself I'm still holding out for long term. I've been with AM since about Feb/March and I havent been disappointed yet by them. 
Hopefully you sold most of your shares towards the 4.5 price :)
@_date: 2013-09-13 15:25:51
I don't really get your posts. But just a bit of short browsing and it looks like your anti btc.... Which is totally cool but why do you come here and post about how it's a ponzi etc etc. I doubt that anyone would sell their btc after reading these types of posts so just curious as to why you're posting about how it's a ponzi.
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:28:38
I bought in low, would be a while before I see any dip
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:01:48
if you order 100 eruptor blades - thats about 1,300GH, under 50g. It would take you 42 days - highest ROI being like ~270 coins...
Now getting 100 blades setup is not gonna be easy.... 
Honestly it sounds like you didnt do research, if you didnt do research you're probably not gonna be able to do this.
EDIT: you got 50g's to just drop on mining hardware? lol

Makes sense! Thanks so much guys... I just wasnt sure how it allowed me to - I mean I was happy as shit that it did work. Just wanted to know the reasoning behind it. upvotes for you!

Anyone actually try purchasing? I wanna buy a few cases but it won't let me unless I don't want to put my cc info there if I can pay with bitcoin... Emailed their support, hopefully get an answer asap

Something we should be worrying about here?
I'm not too familiar with tradehill but I know that they handle big deals, were they able to make them before being with IACU?

Umm you're supposed to save those codes they give you... you take that code and you just redownload the authenticator - then add them back on.....

On my phone so this was best I could find.

Do your own research and make your decisions. I agree with above that it is risky - but only risk what you are willing to lose.
It's good to see he made profit - but his post makes it sound like to not invest into the company.
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:05:23
hahah yeah mining is a bit difficult - I'd say just buy coins and if you feel crazy invest into some of the securities out there! :)
