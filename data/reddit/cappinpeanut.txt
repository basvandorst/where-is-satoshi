The trip down is supposed to be the fun part of the roller coaster.

There is no reason to use BofA and not a local credit union.
BofA is great if you like fees and red tape. Local credit union is great if you like your money.
Do yourself a favor and make the switch.

Would make for a good white elephant present though.
Someone in the group will probably know what it is and steal it, and you can buy exactly the price of your white elephant budget.

I’m right here. It’s been explained to me about 10 times, but I still don’t really “get” it.
I get the idea of decentralized currency that is mined, and the general idea of hashrates and blocks, but, man, that’s about where I stand.
I learned about the fed in school, so, I have a firm grasp on that. And it’s not pretty.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:17:58
Yea, I can see how that could be unsettling. But, CNN isn’t talking about the crazy rise of Bitcoin Cash. Crypto Currency is synonymous with Bitcoin, With or without Coinbase.
All Coinbase did was create a sale on Bitcoin, I have half a mind to thank them.

He sold all his coins to avoid a conflict of interest. I mean, at least that’s what he said, take it for what you will.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:15:34
I mean, I’ll concede that it’s easy for me to sound high and mighty,
I’ve only been in it for about a month and I am still up quite a bit. Some people are in the red. But, if everyone’s been paying attention, you should have been expecting this, and shouldn’t have been risking anything you were not comfortable losing.

I think we’re doomed.

But that’s a credit card, you can get credit cards from anywhere. Credit cards and banking are totally different subjects.

We seems to have leveled off. It’s my fault guys, I bought at $14,100. So, naturally, the exciting ride came to a halt.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:12:06
I cannot imagine this is actually true. Wouldn’t this be subject to taxation and minimum wage scrutiny?
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:10:08
That’s the theory.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:47:49
I did the exact same thing!! Logged in and found exactly 0 bitcoin.
Womp womp.

Tell that to anyone who bought Amazon 10 years ago.
Or every stupid tiny “invention” that is so simple a chimp could have come up with it, but, instead, some random fisherman just made it up to make his day easier.
It happens, it’s about timing and having the gall to take a risk.

My credit union refunds me 100% of my ATM fees at the end of the month. Doesn’t matter if it’s a 2 dollar fee at Walmart or a $7 fee in Vegas. At the end of the month, they automatically deposit it back into my checking account.
I use any ATM with no qualms.
You can also deposit your money into most credit unions around the country (of which there are many) and they will put it in your account, that’s the union part of the credit union.
Because credit unions &gt; banks.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:11:45
Banks are a dime a dozen. I’d be out of there the moment my bank started telling me what to do.
See ya!

There was a post on r/showerthoughts last week that said something to the effect of:
When people think about time travel, they know not to change anything small in their past as to not alter the future, but no one ever thinks of doing something small in the present to effect their future.

Transferring money to buy bitcoin has been my greatest downfall as well.
I’m always waiting for funds to transfer while it’s low and then it goes up! I always insist not to use a CC, I just don’t like the idea of borrowing money to invest, even if I’m going to pay it back in 5 days when my money moves. That mindset has literally cost me thousands.
Why is everything so slooooooow? I can wait for magic future crypto money to eliminate that problem.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:57:41
Sure, could end in a total disaster. But, so far, I’m pretty happy with my substantial gains and have not invested anything that I am not completely comfortable losing.
That’s how taking a risk works, right? If this takes off and is the currency of the future like it’s supposed to be, then I’m set.
If it falls on its face, I’ve lost money that I was comfortable losing. I’ve missed an opportunity to invest it somewhere else, but, again, that’s the risk.

Well that’s kinda my point. It’s only been a month, and in that month, I’ve looked around and listened to what people have said, watched trends, read history etc.
There’s people here that have been HODLing looooooong before me and those people have HODLed through much worse.
Look around. Bitcoin is valued at 16.5 thousand dollars. It’s on the front page of news sites, it’s being added to financial exchanges. It is the gold standard, it is the Google of crypto currency. Instead of saying crypto, people just say bitcoin. THAT is a big deal.
In that month, I’ve come to expect a big dip, I was expecting a much bigger one. I wouldn’t consider myself an authority on anything here, just a guy taking a risk like everybody else.
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:15:09
There are no other fees. I can’t think of a single thing that I pay fees for.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:13:27
I’m going to be completely honest with you. I thought you said memepool...
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:48:23
It will probably dip, but then, it also might not. The 10% that it MAY dip will be made up in a week of it doesn’t, so, it hardly makes sense to wait. Ita going to go up from here regardless.
I will confess though, I’m in the same boat as your my E*TRADE money finally hit my bank account and I want to get it into more bitcoin, but it’s hard psychologically to do what I know I should do.

Am millennial, went to college, got job, bought house, sold house, bought bigger house.
The trick is not buying $9 avocado toast for breakfast. Rolling up your sleeves and getting to work.
I am also invested in BTC though, but that’s for when the kids come.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:07:55
Yea, I mean no disrespect. And there’s a catch 22. No one who has done okay for themselves wants someone to tell them that they got lucky and no one that hasn’t quite made it yet wants to be told that they just need to work harder.
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:45:12
I got it working when it first became a thing, but since I didn’t expect it to take off, I just used my gaming computer to mine, which was almost pointless.
I think I’ll heed this advice and just look into buying coin then watch it go up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:20:26
Sigh. I only learned this lesson at 8k so I bought a few hundred dollars. Now I’m waiting for Money to move from my E*TRADE so I can buy more.
I should have been paying attention. Sigh.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:15:30
I mean, the search function on Reddit isn’t exactly perfect... and with the price increasing 4-5% every single day, the same question asked a week later is a completely different question.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:37:30
This is going to be the stupidest question ever, but, what exactly is happening here, how does this market work? (I’m pretty new).
Conventional wisdom says that a lot of people are cashing out as we near 10k, and an equal amount of people are jumping on board, all right below that 10k mark. Is that what’s happening here, or does this work differently?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:19:27
I only have Coinbase. What exchange do you use to trade the small guys?
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:03:14
In all honesty, it doesn’t matter how much of a Bitcoin you have, if you have any, then you are seeing a great ROI. You can’t beat yourself up for getting in late, celebrate your gains, even if they are small, you are still gaining.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:51:01
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:58:38
Hahaha noted
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:43:34
Ah, makes sense. Maybe I’ll just look into getting coins instead.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:15:32
I need it to slow down while my money transfers from E*TRADE to my bank account...
Stocks have just let me down, I want to ride the rocket too!
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:59:25
Appreciate this insight. Seems like just buying BTC is a better option.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:44:56
Screw it, I’m buying more. We’re all driving this up together, right?
I didn’t take the risk in 2013, I’m not making that mistake again now that I have money to invest.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:47:35
Haha this is me. I got in at 8k, but, I’m celebrating like I was in at $8.
Gains are gains, and better late than never.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:07:06
Wish I had done this. I went in with Money that I could afford to lose, I wasn’t using it and it was sitting in an account, I dusted it off for btc. Which I am glad I did, but, what you did was smart. You’re playing with house money, doubling it would be awesome, losing it sets you back to where you started, no losses.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:02:18
This is actually more convincing than it should be...
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:00:22
Bitcoin is down...
