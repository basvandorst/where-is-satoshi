Oh dang you know I was going to do this but my crystal ball that saw the dip coming broke. Oh well.
@_date: 2018-01-05 22:20:02
Exactly.  As someone who owns 0 bitcoin, my unbiased opinion is.. he's right. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 15:12:04
Based on... ? 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:27:34
But you do realize if everyone paid the higher fees we would all then still have the same priority and thus be waiting forever for our transactions..
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:14:59
If btc became a national currency, the transaction volume would be so high if you tried to send btc today it would probably get there thursday so still slower than banks lol..
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:11:10
I checked etherdelta and can't see it, are you sure its on there? Am I doing something wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:50:43
What if you donated to projects that are trying to get cryptocurrencies up and running as a form of actual payment in the world? People arent going to give two craps about Bitcoin if you can't actually use it for anything ever.
@_date: 2018-01-04 22:36:59
I will literally sh*t my pants if he announced FB will adopt BTC. He said Cryptocurrency, which will most likely NOT be BTC.. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:06:18
Dude, btc has the slowest avg transaction speeds of any coin. This is even considering the INSANE amount of machines mining right now. Now use your super advanced knowledge to calculate what might happen if transaction volume was multiplied times 100,000 %. . People would be paying insane fees and still wait hours . Those who pay minimum fees (still high fees btw) would be waiting DAYS if not WEEKS. So yes, compared to other coins,  and even slow banking transactions, BTC is Very slow. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:14:37
Oh yeah that sounds awesome. Let me just pay $50 to get my transaction processed sooner. What a great idea. YOU clearly do not understand block sizes , and why BTC needs a much larger one. You also seem to have trouble grasping that there are like 20 other coins gaining popularity right now that defeat BTC transaction speeds and have miniscule fees AND have a proper coin supply to serve as a truly functional currency. BTC is a toy, and it will be gone very soon.

Dude coinbase don't give  a sheet. They are getting rich af off all us especially the people silly enough to "invest" large amounts of real cash into fake imaginary crypto coins, 99% of which will not exist in 1 year.
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:58:03
Well that is odd, it was absolutely showing a near zero balance to me when I posted this. No idea what happened 
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:34:22
So who solved it? Prize address is empty. 
Would the winner like to share the solution and how they found it?

Does your health randomly go from 1 to 3 hearts then back down to 0 and you die for no apparent reason?
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:41:09
Everyone reading this who actually has a video of themselves jacking off just had a moment of "... Would I risk not paying him?" .. 
Admit it.
@_date: 2019-08-27 00:17:29
Yes but you know it will primarily be used by the rich, corrupt, and evil people of the world to dodge taxes, hide assets to avoid legal seizure, fund terrorism / human trafficking etc .. there really won't be that many good people using it for a long time.
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:22:03
Yeah uhh dunno if you know this but USD transactions can be traced when you have to establish a relationship with a bank , it can be done but it's difficult, expensive and dangerous. Bitcoin makes it so much easier to remain anonymous, do I really need to explain this to you??
@_date: 2019-10-30 16:25:19
Banks aren't scared, just as an fyi.
@_date: 2018-06-09 23:56:40
So when you go in do you just look at images of food, and when you send them the btc they just look up at you and say "Okay, I just sent you some imaginary food in my mind!" 
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:41:14
Woah, so what you're saying is people like to talk about when they are losing or making money on their investments?! The world must know this SHOCKING revelation!
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:12:23

RTFM LOL 
Seriously, go read about what a quantum computer could actually do, then learn what makes a ledger quantum resistant, then come back to delete your post. Every piece of code written on standard silicone pcs is about as "resistant" to a quantum computer as a napkin to cover a fire hose.
@_date: 2019-06-25 00:42:12
I'm not really concerned enough to look it up, but I'm fairly confident a quantum computer would obliterate all current crypto currencies, if not by hacking the wallets, then by mining all remaining coins in a matter of days. I'm not sure you have a solid grasp on how insanely powerful a true quantum computer would be?
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:17:05
You're right it's not like a classic computer, it would need to have specialized code written to allow it to even interact with current technologies. And quantum resistant is a vague term. The idea is the difficulty increases if blocks are mined too quickly. But what if a computer existed that could mine hundreds of blocks per minute simultaneously at maximum difficulty .

And how many trees were bought with traditional currency? I would view this more as someone trying to use their btc for something before the price dips in 2020.

By the time you sit down to eat it is it reduced to a 1-inch by 1-inch Square?
@_date: 2019-04-23 03:33:22
It's funny because without gold to make computers Bitcoin wouldn't exist.
@_date: 2019-04-15 16:04:47
So what? The large banks I've worked at had similar training. Doesn't mean anything except they want people to understand what they are. They are no closer to integration than 5 years ago.
@_date: 2019-04-04 18:02:07
People panic bro. Ever heard of the great depression?  
Also when something is on its way down fast and hard, heavy volume traders sell and try to buy back in at the "bottom", which makes it fall even faster but also speeds up the bounce back up.
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:49:02
You seriously don't think a shitload of people are buying in for the last few months waiting for this exact event to make short term gains? People will be selling on the way down for sure. Amateur traders who thought it would moon to 20k will bail the fuck out if it starts crashing.
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:10:27
But how do long term hodlers make the price stable? Hodling doesn't do anything, literally it does nothing to help or hurt the price. 
So if a bunch of new money rolls in to make a quick buck.. see where I'm going with this? The only way it goes up up, way up again is if a LOT of new money comes in and the vast majority of that money decides to STAY in. Do you really think that's more likely than the vast majority of them selling after some mediocre gains?
Personally I think all the long term hodlers got in a looong time ago, and won't be buying any more .

I like the symbolism here, giving away your Bitcoin to be with her.
Because if you get married and get a joint bank account and one day she notices you bought a bunch of cryptocurrency she will divorce your ass ��
@_date: 2018-03-01 23:55:22
If I were rich I would buy this just to send the seller a video of me throwing it in the trash.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:58:47
Yeah that's not really how orbits work though , is it? As you approach a massive object you have to reach the speed required to enter orbit at a given distance to the object. So if the planet needs to go 99.9 % speed of light to be in orbit, how did the planet get moving that fast? Doesn't make sense.

-Bro the gravity here is so strong it effects time! Which isn't really true but anyway there is sooo much gravity here!!! 
- wait..If there's so much gravity here why aren't we being flattened to the ground like a human pancake??
-Did I mention the GRAVITY though?! Let's surf this mega wave with our invincible ship !!! 
Great movie.

I must be an anamoly because I'm down like 95% from my crypto investments. But my stocks and money in the bank is doing fine.

1.) Who do you think you are
2.) What gives you the right

This is a very cute way for her to say "you have a problem please get help before we are bankrupt" .

Why is everything in crypto always related back to dragonballsackz? Is everyone here just a kid living at home watching cartoons and investing their allowance into crypro?
@_date: 2018-04-16 22:09:12
Came here to post this, then it pays you in real coins when you finish a level lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-11 22:53:32
I remember making $150 every few minutes on TRX as it would wildly swing up 75% every night... 
And then losing ALL of that when it would crash .. I suck at day trading.
