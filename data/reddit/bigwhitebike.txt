Inferstructure in a rapidly growing economy isn't going to affect the price instantly. Is every bitcoin holder on the exchanges? No, because Mt. GOX showed that if you dont have your private keys you don't own the BTC. Are more people using bitcoins in the economy than trading? I'm positive. 
The price is slowly going up for a reason; the economy is getting stronger, more places accept BTC, trusted systems are forming. I think the price rising 1000%/yr is a direct cause of that. The all time high is just a symptom of trading.

You've been following this thing for 2 years. You should have a good idea what to do with your money.
It really comes down to one question: Do you think if you invest, will your money be worth more in BTC by the time you want to use it?

Yeah,  $275 per ticket for 2 days is rough. Don't they all know that everyone is still holding on to their BTC?!

Bitcoin is a gamble but usually the best time to buy is when the price is low. The price compared to the all time high is very low. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:38:12
I disagree on it failing if it becomes too much of a currency or commodity. It'll fail on a fatal protocol or lack of interest. A fatal protocol can be fixed by the developers and a fork in the code would be adopted. The lack of interest is most likely not going away as more merchants get on board and the price keeps following it's macro trends.

There are many opinions on if they will be sold at, below, or above market value. No one knows yet but it only takes one bid per block to have it go over market value. 
If anything, the US government auctioning off bitcoins acknowledges bitcoins legitimacy. They could have thrown the private keys away but they decided that bitcoin has value. 
My opinion, they'll go above value and the price will be pulled alongside it.

Set up with Coinbase for purchasing bitcoins and ask everyone that you buy supplies from if they accept bitcoin. If they dont, then go to the next person and ask some more. 
Bitcoin is still in its early stages but proof of ownership isn't hard to comprehend. Research "colored coins" and you'll find people trying to implement that on top of the blockchain. But just think about a single satoshi (smallest bitcoin increment) being "colored" and then whoever has that satoshi has proof that they own a certain stock, property, business, etc.

It might not be 100% sound but I always go with, "Bitcoins are like cash for the internet. No middle man, anyone with an internet connection can accept it, and for laughably low transaction fees."

Simply put, a hard fork is a change of the Bitcoin protocol that is not backwards-compatible; i.e., older client versions would not accept blocks created by the updated client, considering them invalid. Obviously, this can create a blockchain fork when nodes running the new version create a separate blockchain incompatible with the older software.

You control you're money. If you're the only one that knows the private key than nobody can take them away from you or delay retrieving them for days. With it being only 4 years old it's been a highly valued asset, going from pennies per BTC to +$1000. It's nearly instant, if you don't worry about confirmations (since double spending costs billions of dollars in infrastructure). You can give them to anyone with an internet connection.  
Instant. Cheap. Secure.

If you look at the Bitstamp charts on [Bitcoinwisdom.com]( you'll see a very strange flat line. 
At around 8:00pm CT yesterday someone put down  a ~30,000 BTC sell wall at $300 (around $9M worth). 
No one really knows the motivation for someone to put up such an order but we do know that it was [instant]( (which means one account, not a piling of 30k BTC at $300) and that it was called by many people on Bitstamp as the order was bought fully at 2:06am CT this morning.

As the person that requested it, I saw that it came from his account. Doesn't mean much but thought to let you know.

The new transaction ATH is still pretty exciting. Every new innovation and game is a plus for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:20:43
The more widespread the better. You'll reach a lot more people if you target poor demographics than exclusive, rich ones.

I invested my savings into bitcoin and now have x4 my savings worth instead of exactly what it would still be sitting in the bank. Also, I'm not worried at all of it crashing down and never rebounding. If it falls bank down to my original investment I would invest more. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 03:34:03
Yes, the best way is to just buy them. I thought I got in too late at $150. Buy some now and I bet they'll be worth more in 6 months. In the mean time look up r/jobs4bitcoins and try to sell your skills. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 17:20:18
If you think it'll keep going up, then yes. It is deflationary. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:05:23
David. Fucking. Woo.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:53:26
I was the same way when I bought in at $230 and it dropped down to $60. I felt so stupid but I held on. The deflationary aspect of bitcoin will eventually have it climb back up. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:50:44
Have fun when it hits $400.
@_date: 2013-08-29 18:04:41
Which means more demand/value.
@_date: 2013-12-02 05:10:52
Bought 1 BTC at $218 before the April crash. Felt burned but held on to it. Read up everything about bitcoins and have made some calculated risks that have paid off.

I'm pretty sure you're going to have to pay for capital gains. It would be pretty easy for the IRS to ask how he got so much extra money to pay off his loans. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:42:22
Just bought in today before the big drop. These huge fluctuations are insane. I wont be taking out for awhile but hopefully I make a smart trade here or there. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:25:12
What a swell guy.

The Chinese statement was like a parent telling their 21 year old kid, "Alcohol is dangerous but you can still buy it". This statement further legitimized Bitcoin.

I was at my desk and a single thought came to mind after I found out you can't counterfeit BTC and how divisible it is. I imagined Bitcoin as a big pot of gold in the middle of a table surrounded by 10 people. Then I imagined how valuable that pot would be if it was surrounded by 10 million people.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:52:21
Everyone says they're going to buy when it dips. You actually had the balls to do it. Congratulations.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:07:18
It's awesome! I have instant also and it made it so much easier when my friends wanted to invest a little.

Nobody knows and it always seems like a lot whenever you buy in.
 Personal opinion? Get in. The more interest, the higher the price. You'll be kicking yourself when it hits $400+. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 20:35:15
Same here, BTC news is addicting. Plus I'm always trying to learn the ins and outs of everything Bitcoin so I can describe it correctly in an argument/conversation. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 16:08:59
Which subject sparked your interest to start this project, Bitcoin or Silk Road? Did that change over time?

What the heck is this?

I wonder if they're still mining with that ASIC that they threw away the key to.

@_date: 2013-11-14 13:21:44
Yep, to be verified. Welcome to the game. You can't just jump in and be accredited. They have to know that they can trust your account. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:52:47
good answer hardleft121. bitcoin is SHOOTING UP!
@_date: 2013-08-27 17:29:16
Quite the opposite. I've never seen an ATM without a withdrawal fee in the US if it wasn't with my bank.

You remind me of someone that missed out.

True, but I think a lot of people will want them. My USD has 0% potential for growth.

$50 price fluctuations blow my mind.
