The pace of technology adoption has increased dramatically over the past few decades for sure.  But something as entrenched as Visa/MC has an enormous amount of inertia.
But let's assume you are absolutely correct.  Have you ever heard of large, entrenched company that has been able to adapt like you describe?  Personally, I can't think of a single example.  And it isn't from lack of trying; they just aren't capable of making that kind of dramatic change.

2^256 = 1.16e+77  When you say "quite rare" are you implying that it sometimes happens?

Visa and Mastercard aren't "doing nothing"  It costs a lot of money to maintain a network that can process 100's of thousands of transactions a minute.  Plus customer service, fraud investigation, accounts, etc. etc.  
I don't know what their margins are, but they are far from doing nothing to earn their pay.
I think the bigger problem is that they are the only game in town.  No real competition, except for something like bitcoin.

A dollar bill is just a piece of paper that is very hard to counterfeit and has an established market value.  The big difference between that and a bitcoin on a piece of paper is that the legal system recognizes the dollar bill as having value.  I'm not sure they would recognize the bitcoin paper as having value the same way.
Someday, they will have to.  The question is how would they see it now.

OK, but that assumes there is a shared perception of the value of the item.
If I write a business idea that I say is worth $100M on a piece of paper and you steal it from me, you haven't stolen $100M.  In face, you probably didn't steal anything of value at all.
In the MMORPG game Eve, people stole things worth in-game money that was worth thousands of dollars on an exchange.  But that wasn't considered a crime.
I don't know that law enforcement would see a piece of paper with a bunch of GUIDs on it as being worth actual money.

Making a computer that is 1,000 times faster is a pretty major accomplishment.  But it is a tiny dent in the probability of generating a duplicate.  I would not say "the odds become high" when we are talking about something that takes longer than the expected life of the universe.

Can you elaborate on that?  What crime?  I've stolen a piece of paper with numbers on it.

I would argue that their money is probably better spent reinforcing the status quo than trying to innovate solutions that would just cut into their profit margin.
If you went to Blockbuster when 1% of the population had 28.8 baud modems and told them they were going to get eaten by a company that would let you download movies, they would rightfully laugh you out of their plush offices.  A visionary might be able to see that *someday* that could happen, but it would be way too far beyond a corporate horizon to worry about.
Bitcoin seems kind of like that to me currently.  Way beyond the corporate horizon of someone like Visa.

ok, but if I write my own song right now and you steal it, have you stolen anything of value?  What would happen if I tried to report this crime to the police?  My assumption is that they would not arrest you.

Pretty much **any possible thing** you can imagine is more likely to happen than someone generating a duplicate, so why would you spend even seconds doing anything for this eventuality?  If you make a list of all the things that can happen to you that will impact your life negatively, a bitcoin duplicate is at position N.  You should worry about 1..(N-1) first.

I don't think people can really conceptualize numbers this large.

Well, from a social perspective I have certainly created a crime.  My interest is whether the law would see me as committing a crime.
How long with it take the legal system to really understand bitcoin enough to see this kind of thing as a crime?
