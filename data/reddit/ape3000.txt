Actually with lightning the fees somewhat depend on the amounts, because there must be channels that are big enough or you will need to aggregate lots of channels. This is especially true if lightning doesn't have near 100% of users since the funds in channels are temporarily locked away from other uses.

It seems that the issue tracker feature is not enabled for that github repository. I actually checked that before using this reddit thread as the issue tracker.
I'm using 64-bit Arch Linux.
Building gives this output:
    building 'timelock.kernels.sha256' extension
    gcc -pthread -Wno-unused-result -Werror=declaration-after-statement -DDYNAMIC_ANNOTATIONS_ENABLED=1 -DNDEBUG -g -fwrapv -O3 -Wall -Wstrict-prototypes -march=x86-64 -mtune=generic -O2 -pipe -fstack-protector-strong --param=ssp-buffer-size=4 -fPIC -I/usr/include/python3.4m -c timelock/kernels/sha256module.c -o build/temp.linux-x86_64-3.4/timelock/kernels/sha256module.o

EDIT: I am using Python 3.4.1 and OpenSSL 1.0.1.g.
EDIT2: And GCC 4.9.0.

Downgrading to Python 3.3.4 or GCC 4.8.2 didn't help.

Note that this is not a bitcoin mining hash rate.
I guess you could get around this rate with a decent CPU. I'm not sure how much dedicated hardware would help in this case, but you could probably get higher rates with a timelock ASIC.

3.0 Mhash/s. You can calculate it from the "n" value on the chain definition.

sha256module compilation succeeded without errors, but I get this when trying to use it:
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      ...
      File "timelock/kernel.py", line 133, in run
        return timelock.kernels.sha256.run(nonce, n)
    SystemError: error return without exception set

I created an issue on github. We should move the discussion there.
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:54:12
Yes, the python kernel works.

Does anybody want to start a ~~mining~~ news voting pool?
@_date: 2014-06-04 17:19:48
The sha256 function itself should be exactly the same, but it's not used the same way in timelock. GPUs and Bitcoin ASICs are good for bitcoin mining because they can execute the sha256 operation so many times concurrently. Timelock computing doesn't benefit anything from that concurrency. It just needs one execution to finish as quickly as possible.

This is an interesting idea. The problem is that news aren't **new** for very long. We need a blockchain for giving recent work extra value.
The news item hash would have the previous block hash in addition to the link and nonce. New blocks would only include news that have the correct block hash. That way we know how much work the various pieces of news have received in any specific time period. The news reader could for example show news based on the best hash value within the last 24 hours (or n blocks).
BTW, thanks for my 4.975 mBTC.

I'm always just late for these.
EDIT: Wow, thanks! I just bought one year of gold. :)

The main point in using this serialized hashing is not prevent ASICs. It is to make the hashing times predictable.
@_date: 2014-05-06 21:38:56
I'm just afraid that there isn't enough incentive for lots of people to mine the news they like. And there is too much gain for somebody investing in mining just to upvote their advertisements.

Yes, it would probably push up the prices at first, but on long term more demand creates more R&amp;D and improves mass production efficiency which might lower the prices.

I understood that this is not to be a distributed storage, but instead replacing proof of work to create a cryptocoin. The used storage space wouldn't be used for anything useful (in the same was as PoW computation time is "wasted").
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:09:59
It might be desirable, because to have a cryptocoin you otherwise need to have PoW, which wastes cpu/gpu/asic power and energy.
@_date: 2017-04-26 06:03:31
Yes, of course you can. But there is already very high demand for electricity so the returns are diminishing. And yes, Bitcoin does push down the price of Bitcoin ASIC chips very rapidly (per hashing power).
Since Bitcoin didn't use CPUs or GPUs for that long it probably didn't have that big of a lasting impact on those. But, I believe that the altcoins that are GPU mined are having this effects on GPUs (on some scale).

There has been some talk about probabilistic closing payouts. I don't know if there are any implementations. It means that if you have 600 millisatoshis you have a 60 % probability to get a satoshi.
