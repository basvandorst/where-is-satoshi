Downvoting because I'm tired of hearing about him.
I would prefer we forget him rather than have regular hate threads (even if there are good reasons to hate).
Let him fall into irrelevance.

Bitmex is BTC-settled.

You can actually hardfork with any amount of hashpower. But with less than 50% you are at risk of getting attacked by the original chain's miners.

I did not know that, thanks for the tip.

Yeah, sounds like he checked the rate right at the top of today's pump.
Right now I'm seeing it at a ~5usd difference. That's 0.7%. If you add exchange trading fees and possible slippage, I think you get basically the same price.

Couldn't you just have the phone store a child [extended private key]( instead of the root one?
That seems actually like what explains there:

By the time we reach that, more than one halving may have passed.

Wouldn't such miner get its own blocks orphaned by the rest of the network?
@_date: 2016-06-19 12:32:49
The root extended private key would indeed never touch anything online.
Only one of its child (and the children of this child) would.
Really, method is exactly what I meant.

Now post this in r/btc and watch it get upvoted too, but unironically.

Ethereum is nice, but not as a store of value IMO

It does raise the limit, but via a soft fork. Whether it's a good thing or not is debatable.

Where does that volume number comes from?
I'm guessing it includes the same coins traded back and forth a few times in the same day.

He kind of just said he's afraid it's gonna **fail** and tarnish the reputation of all cryptocurrencies.
