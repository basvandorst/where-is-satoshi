Not a fault of bitcoin, moreso the new/relatively untested software that makes up Stremium. Much more work is needed

Yes, back at 9pm central tonight. We refreshed because it had frozen on our side but doing so kicked everyone out and set the balance back to 0 btc :( sucks but well be back with even more fun! open to requests too ;)

haha well glad to be of assistance! My bf was definitely excited to be a part of something that he says could be one of many 'killer apps' for bitcoin at such an early stage in its inception :)

no sound, lag might have been due to our connection here

Turns out the address that Stremium was directing to was NOT the one I input when setting the stream up. So one of two things happened, either it was a interim address controlled by Stremium, OR someone somehow changed the address. Im leaning towards the latter. Either way Stremium still needs a lot of work

Yes im going up to $20 tonight so hopefully it will be less users. With my comment earlier, when I hit refresh and it kicked the viewers out and reset the balance earned to 0, did that money get refunded back to the viewers?? Just curious as to how this works in these situations. Don't want users to get burned and not come back. Might see if there's a way to not kick viewers or reset the balance if the browser page is refreshed.

must have been an escrow address on Stremiums side, the address I input was: 13Dm3AinxPvtzxtpC68FAHB9zjr63W5hTq
Still empty unfortunately
