Sorry for the ambiguity in my question. is correct in regards to what I was looking for.
@_date: 2016-04-23 04:25:51
Yes, that's correct. That's what I wanted to know about.

Thank you.

I only heard about the fork at the last minute. My bitcoin was locked up in a vault and I cannot access it until after the fork.
Today I checked my spam folder and found all the emails from Coinbase about the fork went to the spam folder so I had literally no idea this was happening.
I'm a buy and hold guy so I wouldn't dump the BCH immediately anyways. If it turns out to be worthless, nothing lost. But if it turns out to hold value, I'm really hoping Coinbase finds a way to credit me the lost BCH.

That's an interesting strategy. I hadn't thought about selling to get out and buying back later.
Now my BTC are stuck in pending status while they transfer out of the vault. Not much I can do but grind my teeth and wait.

OK, perfect. Thanks!

I never said inequality is good. What I said is it is a fundamental characteristic of the universe. You can spend your life bemoaning it, or you can accept and make peace with it.

Laws of nature generally favor inequality in distribution of resources. Compare the ratio of ocean water to sandy beaches; mass of the Sun to the mass of the vacuum of space surrounding it; size of an elephant to the size of an aphid.
When you wish for equality in economic affairs, you are applying concepts of political equality (which are constructed) to market forces (which are emergent, in the absence of interference). It's a mismatch of expectations.
