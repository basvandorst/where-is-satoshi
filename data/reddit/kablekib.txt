6.29 blocks per hour over the past day, 7+ per hour over the past week.
Bitcoin can't handle all these transactions even at a faster than normal block rate. I can't imagine what's going to happen when BCH profitability catches up (it fell behind due to BTC price increase) and takes some more hashpower...

Hi -johoe, thanks for your site I use it all the time. Would it be possible to add one more graph that shows "Pending Transaction Fee in USD" instead of BTC? I think it would be a nice addition and would make it easier to see how much is actually pending in dollar value compared to the earlier spikes in the mempool since the price increase makes it look like the fees are about the same as they were the last time the mempool was filling up, but they are actually way way higher.

Only it's not at equilibrium right now because of the massive price swings. Check the fork.lol site. I didn't say anything about the flippening you are reading things out of my comments that I didn't say.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:23:15
I can afford the extra bandwidth and hard drive space, but I don't think I can afford the extra fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:03:00
Then we will divide it further.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:49
The fees are lower if you are counting them in BTC than they were last time, but not in USD due to the price increase. I suspect soon it will cost more in BTC as well.

BlockChain.info doesn't just time-stamp it when it receives the block?
@_date: 2014-02-13 04:47:15
Yeah, sure. I'm on to you.
@_date: 2014-01-31 21:16:02
Oh one more thing, can we get a running total of all the transactions since the last block somewhere?
@_date: 2014-01-04 05:24:49
Thanks man.
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:41:50
Wow that's awesome! Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-05 23:09:12
This isn't new, this happened to me in December, I just generated another address and it worked fine.
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:28:16
Can you mine scrypt coins with this? I will not be downloading until it's open sourced, just curious for now.
@_date: 2014-02-14 03:49:44
Starts at [46:56](

I'm getting this warning from Chrome opening this link:
The site's security certificate is not trusted!
You attempted to reach  but the server presented a certificate issued by an entity that is not trusted by your computer's operating system. This may mean that the server has generated its own security credentials, which Chrome cannot rely on for identity information, or an attacker may be trying to intercept your communications.
You should not proceed, especially if you have never seen this warning before for this site.
@_date: 2014-02-22 07:56:45
Maybe it was good foresight if we end up increasing the block size limit.
@_date: 2014-01-12 05:46:55
It can still hold them flagged as not verified until the preceeding blocks are downloaded.
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:40:48
Then they become an exchange..
@_date: 2014-01-17 20:02:34
1. Why should we trust you?  
2. What happens if miners fail?  
3. How much control do we have over our shares?  
4. Are we able to specify our own pools or mine other SHA256 coins?  
5. How long are we guaranteed to have that hashing power?  
6. Is it possible to have KnCMiner company publicly endorse you or prove you have at least ordered the KnC Miner Neptune's with a receipt or invoice.
@_date: 2014-01-31 04:08:37
Would be cool if we could see where the individual transactions originated (blockchain.info shows "relayed by IP").
@_date: 2014-01-11 20:41:12
That was the last time we crossed.
Now this: 
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:28:01
ELI5 why transaction malleability is even a problem when you can just write wallet software that detects transactions related to your addresses without discriminating based on the txid?
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:01:32
If it's a system drive (rather than a secondary) do NOT turn on the computer. Any more writes to that drive could overwrite your deleted files if they haven't been already. Put the hard drive in another computer as a secondary before attempting recovery.

They don't need a computer they just need a wifi hotspot and a satellite and a way to send 260bytes
@_date: 2017-08-09 21:45:02
What was the transaction fee for that coffee?
@_date: 2017-08-17 15:20:28
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:55:01
And lost $15 to transaction fees

If you are buying then not 'everyone' is selling. You are part of everyone.

I see you haven't heard of etherieum classic. Never fork ;)
@_date: 2013-11-18 13:12:55
We're in  on freenode now.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:07:19
This is the site if anyone is wondering: 
@_date: 2013-12-02 20:34:03
Quickest way is probably to search for the receiving address on [blockchain.info]( It will give you one. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:57:14
Why not? Scan a QR code, send btc. Just as quick as debit/cc transaction. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:00:11
Well said.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:33:55
Haha I love how it says it's worth $10.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:17:23
How does BitPay do it?
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:59:33
Probably safer to put up an ad for a sell on localbitcoins as a cash deposit into his/her bank account.

Port is actually 6667 (default).
