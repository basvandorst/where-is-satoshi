The fact that you know which one I meant proves that it's not at all comparable to those three scams. 
But yeah; I'm sure your opinion is worth more than some of the top 500 Forbes companies' investments and endorsements. /s

Why are you talking about Obama to a European? You can't spell the word, you talk gibberish and draw 'conclusions' without having looked into the subject? Yeah, okay.

The workers from India do NOT have the same quality education or skills at all though. Because currently the Western education systems are generally still superior. (Note: I'm not talking about potential here but the knowledge/skills they have been taught through their subsidized education.) I'm in IT and I see this all of the time. We may very well outsource to India, Northern Africa, Eastern Europe etc to cut costs but for all the good work my colleagues overseas do they generally lack technical know-how, usually due to lack of in-depth education (easy US-applicable example of this is there's no way public schools will have access to the newest technologies in computer labs for example the way privatized schools do - which is what you pay for).


While I completely agree I hope the irony isn't getting past you. I've had to hit you with quite a few ad hominems before being able to arrive to this civil discussion. We should teach people to be open to discussions and other's view points, not censor them or shout over them. That freedom of speech is the beauty of the US system which exists nowhere else in the exact same way.
While the US political system has been subverted for quite a while now there's no reason for *educated* people to be so partisan and carry such animosity against the "other side". That's exactly what perpetuates the current status quo (if not making it worse). This wave of new extreme leftism (and not-so-new rightism) should be concerning. To any outsider, non-US citizen it's clear as crystal that the Democrats and Republicans are two different sides of the same coin.

Never heard about the website before today. The reason we're having this discussion is you think it's acceptable to censor people you don't agree with.
(Also: I pity you for having nothing better to do than checking my post history).
Do us both a favour and don't reply.

Again with the anecdotal evidence. Like I said, you're too far up your own commie ass and can't be reasoned with. 
PS: Would you really like to compare my ego to yours Mr. Intel/Google/Nvidia?
@_date: 2018-10-29 08:07:10
You're so far up your own ass and clearly unwilling to view points from another viewpoint so why pretend you do? To prolong the conversations and sling more ad hominems at people?
Every person with even a little bit of empathy would agree that free healthcare and education for everyone would be a thing to strive for. If you believe however that giving more say about education (and healthcare) to the government I doubt you've looked into the subject enough. And regarding the 'garbage you don't benefit from'. That 'corporate welfare' you communists hate so much is what is allowing you to be the person you are today, whining on some forum instead of plowing the field for minimum wage. It's what has allowed the USA to be where it is today and it's communists like yourself that are causing it to lose face in the world more and more by the day. If you can't see how privatized education and healthcare and a free market approach would benefit everyone in the long term I don't know where your head is at.
Bitcoin is not the communist ideal you think it to be.

As anyone can see from your comments these past \~12 hours you like to assume people with a different viewpoint than yours are on the right if not 'alt-right' which, let's be honest here, we all know is the quick and easy way to call them fascists. So why can't I assume you're left leaning and thus 'a commie'? Somehow being on the other end of the barrel doesn't feel the same way I'm sure.
It's normal to try and understand a certain topic looking at it from your own experiences but when you fail to see the big picture because you're hung up on your anecdotal evidence then that's a problem. The state didn't force your parents to hand over 30k for your education. They paid that money to give you a shot at the best education they could afford, I'm sure. (If I'm not mistaken in the USA you have access to both private AND public schools, correct me if I'm wrong). Just as with any other business a private school having too high prices would have a lack of 'customers' and would risk going out of business or getting undercut by other businesses (schools). This free market approach is what keeps businesses on their toes and striving to be the best. This is what allowed the US to have some of the best universities in the world. If you think having public education is going to allow the US to keep having a high quality education I strongly suggest you look at education is socialist countries where no incentive to 'be the best business aka school' or free market approach for education exists.
Same goes for healthcare. (European countries, like my own, having laws and regulations preventing companies to extort huge amounts of money for medication (and other malpractices) from their customers does not equal 'free healthcare'). In said countries 'free healthcare' consists of money from taxes going into said healthcare or an extra amount of money to be set aside each month to pay for the monthly health insurance. The left stares itself blind on these issues pretending not to realise that a HUGE amount of low wage working class people would still be unable or unwilling to either pay their taxes or pay for the extra health insurance.
'Free' healthcare is an utopian marxist dream.

It's been said before but rule number 1. Store your bitcoin in your personal wallet, do not leave them on an exchange, ever.

Had you just transferred the 200$ to GDAX (which is Coinbase's Exchange if I'm not mistaken) you could have transferred to your Trezor / Ledger without a fee.
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:37:29
When buying weekly do you already have the money on Coinbase via Wire Transfer or are you doing weekly credit card payments (and thus paying the 3% extra fee to Coinbase)?

Get off your high horse, you're not as smart as you clearly think you are, Einstein.
Yes payment processors were the target, but what do they 'process'? FIAT. 
You don't ask yourself the question why your bank-friends got out unscathed? You know, by playing ball with the state, and I quote, "by freezing 76 bank accounts in 14 countries, preventing players from accessing balances held by the companies."    
If you truly believe "the banks" shouldn't be held accountable for their part in allowing the disguise of all that illicit gambling revenue, you're even dumber than you're sounding.
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:03:04
Because withdrawals were done in fiat and went through, you guessed it, **banks**.
@_date: 2019-01-10 09:18:53
His point is these are things that can be treated and shouldn't impair you in the long run. Thinking of them as 'an impossible task' is holding yourself back for no reason.
