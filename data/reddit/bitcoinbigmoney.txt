Most people fear new things. A lot of what you see is a coordinated effort to kill Bitcoin however most is from people fearful of change regurgitating what they see and hear from the media. Goes to show most people aren't overly bright.

As per usual most of the innovation will come out of the US and other western countries. This bodes well for the economies of these nations going forward.

Get used to it. In a year there will be thousands of crypto currencies. Not too long into the future every actor / singer / band will have one, many companies will try their own, every 10 yr old kid will have one. Some will have value, most won't have much, many will be passing fads. Like with the millions of websites and blogs today, most are garbage, the big ones get most of the traffic. This is all a good thing and is the future. The reliable gold standard will be bitcoin.
