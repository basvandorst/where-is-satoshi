Theres various screenshots and archive.today links with proof that Josh promised such a floor.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:58:20
Jonah Dorman should also be removed as he is the General Manager of the gawminers scam.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:38:04
Hes not going to openly admit to his scam...

Josh Garza is great at avoiding a direct answer to various questions, all of his Q&amp;As are prefabricated and he is really good at being a scammer.
I won't waste my time seeking to Josh Garza's level and he is not worth talking to.
All 4 of us are trying to get a refund on our tickets, we don't want to be part of a FRAUD CONFERENCE. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 18:51:07
I will not attend BTCMiami if Josh Garza is speaking there.
Since it is confirmed that Josh Garza will speak,
Myself and three friends would like a refund for our 4 tickets. We paid to watch a conference about Bitcoins and what the future could bring for the scene. I didn't pay $300/ticket to watch a known scammer(who lies for profits) Josh Garza and his General Manager.
Moe, I hope everyone boycotts your conference, didn't think you'd sink this low.
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:39:07
Hes obviously dumping his own coin on the markets to gather up as many BTC as he can so he can cash out with an extra million dollars.
His little gang of brainwash sheep will buy it all.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:45:23
Its like a police fundraiser being fundraised by a cocaine cartel.
Maybe we can crowdfund whatever paycoin paid them and have Josh removed.
I'll throw in $100 to not see his face there, I would actually like to attend.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:03:38
Are you retarded?
Bitcoin didn't release with 100 different broken promises and someone owning 97% of it all.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:05:58
Afraid? No..
We don't want him recruiting and taking advantage of more unsuspecting individuals. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:14:05


Sorry, I'm not a gambler like you hashtalk scammers.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:50:59
Instead of making the $20/wall he promised he instead thinks its wise to waste everyone's money by going to BTCmiami, Josh and his General Manager will fly, stay at a hotel and sponsor BTCMiami with the money they scammed from people by breaking promises. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 12:45:46
Maybe its Josh Garza selling some of the 10,000+ bitcoins he scammed from people.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:52:50
**Proof of mining.** GAW ordered 5 PH/s of SHA256 hardware from Bitmain. This was revealed two months after hashlet sales started and may be insufficient to sustain payouts for the amount of sold hashrate, estimated to be between 500-1000 GH/s Scrypt-equivalent. There is no proof in the form of a mining address.
**Value of Hashpoints.** At the same time when a significant drop in BTC payouts occured and fee-free Hashpoint mining option was announced GAW also removed the ability to redeem Hashpoints for new Hashlets. The value of Hashpoints relies entirely on the success of PayCoin ICO and the promised 5-fold increase in their value.
**Change of course.** Many users feel that some original Hashlet promises have not been fulfilled, such as ZenPool being the most profitable pool or maintenance fee reduction. Hashlets were marketed as Bitcoin or even Scrypt miners, but the focus is now shifting towards PayCoin with even heavier dependence on GAW's ability to deliver on promises.
**Control of information.** Some long-time Hashtalk forum members have been banned from the forum for asking "inappropriate" questions. Customer support questions and complaints are not allowed on the forum anymore. Some of GAW's past announcements have been modified, removed, or moved out of public view. Some critics have been threatened with legal action.

Hes a scammer who owns gawminers/paybase.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:59:24


Sorry, I will not answer your questions Josh Garza.
Is this another one of your shill accounts? 
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:08:04
Moe obviously doesn't care about nothing but his wallet.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:33:06


And Gaw isn't doing the same? They're literally bought Cryptocoinnews to shill for them.
You shouldn't have to stand up for a company btw....
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:41:32


Why are you defending gawminers?
Are you dumb?
@_date: 2015-01-02 09:36:06
I personally hate scammers and I am going to refrain from going since Moe can't do his due diligence before allowing Josh Garza speak.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:31:05


Only reason you want Josh to continue to scam people is because you have money invested in them.
It's so obvious now you can't look at them as sheep. They are complicit because they know the only way to get money is to draw in more sheep to be slaughtered.
@_date: 2015-01-03 03:35:03

That is self explanatory on its own.
If you google his username with quotations on google: "josg21" and "josg21
It will reveal a lot of shady information about his past.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:45:01


You're being down voted because you're defending a company known for scamming people.
Why are you wasting your time defending them? 
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:32:28
I'll fund it if needed.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:16:19
Because Coinfire is known to help people become aware of scams while Josh is known to scam people..
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:37:56
+1 Everyone should do it!
@_date: 2015-01-02 10:46:27
We could crowdfund the financial losses.
I'll be willing to pay $500 for Josh not to be there.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:54:39
I will put 1 BTC in escrow for someone who eggs Josh Garza at BTCMiami while calling him a scammer.
I'm not joking.
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:26:39
@_date: 2015-01-01 13:39:45
Sounds like gawminers(paybase)
@_date: 2015-01-03 04:16:09
Of course they would, maybe they're in on the scam too.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:35:55
Badbitcoin.org what a joke that site is..
gawminers isn't on his scammer list but WAIT! There is a gawminers ad on the site.
What a sham.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:19:12


Are they going to have a open Q&amp;A for Josh Garza?
If we go, we are going to humiliate the guy. 
@_date: 2015-01-03 02:46:51
Gaw threatening to sue reddit!
He is crying because the truth is finally coming out that he is scamming people.
@_date: 2015-01-01 20:53:14
Myself and 3 others have already talked to the SEC about gawminers, we were called and asked a series of questions.
The person that called us was very familiar with bitcoins and they're familiar with gawminers.
I'm sure they're working on gathering enough evidence to take them down now.

Copied from  archived at 
The terms and conditions, contain the following pieces of information.
*If you are purchasing, or have purchased, Hashlets, you understand and agree that Hashlets are not physical devices and cannot be shipped.
So firstly, they are not Physical devices. Maybe then they are virtual.. software inside some super system?
*Hashlets earnings depend on the pool chosen and Payouts reflect respective Pool Payouts. Selecting a Pool does not imply physically or electronically mining at the selected Pool. Rather, selecting a Pool determines a Payout corresponding to a calculation based on the selected Pool’s payout (based on, for example, real-time Megahash/second/day calculations). A Hashlet is virtual software. You will receive Payouts according to the Pool with with the Hashlet is associated
Their definition here of "virtual software" remember is not hardware - and not even electronic.
As they put it it does not mine on any pool.
But this is the clincher:
You expressly understand the the Company’s sole obligation to You is to Provide a Payout based on the Pool you choose.
So long as they provide a payout that is equivalent to the payout you would have received from the pool you select - they are keeping their agreements to you.
Hashlets are not miners
The proof is in their own Terms and Conditions.
Is it not?
