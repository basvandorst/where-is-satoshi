So that means that the privkey portions of those chains that you give to the departments can be accessed by those departments? Would that mean that they could spend from the addresses given to them?

@_date: 2014-09-23 12:03:12
Hmm, I'm starting to understand. So is it possible then for the corporate treasury to give the department some kind of a sub-master public key so that the department can only generate new public addresses (which then of course belong to the corporate treasury) but not spend from them?

I thought exactly this when I saw the ad. It's actually brilliant and very much fits into the strategy of Patrick Byrne, namely buying up the belly-up .com companies and making them either profitable or selling parts of them to make a profit.
This time however he just took a concept from pets.com and made it attractive because the web is finally mature to do such a thing.
I'd love to hear other people's thoughts on this.

Yes, I am planning to test strategies and use a bot to do that (I'm learning development).
I understand that eventually it's going to end in a loss for the player, however it's still interesting from an educational standpoint. Especially when visualizing data in my case. 
So to continue along those lines, would you happen to know where I can find open source betting sites (if that thing even exists)? This would particularly be educational for me.

Thank you SO MUCH for this post! I've been trying to understand PKE for half a year now and I think I finally got it. I really can't believe this was so simple (and so brilliant). So to recap, the green and red keys were the public keys, and the blue key was the private key. It all makes sense now. Thanks once again.
@_date: 2012-11-01 20:43:08
Thanks, after searching a bit I ran across [this]( article. After reading the whole article it became clear that ZeroAccess thing is no joke, it's probably developed by a programmer(s) with a lot of knowledge and experience.
Java is absent from my system from install since I kept hearing about the exploits over and over again. I also don't really need it for my browsing experience. What is installed is Flash and JavaScript. But luckily Chrome has sandboxed tabs which make JS exploits near-impossible (right?). I don't have AV, but I also never run executable files which I don't trust, never let other people use my machine and am genrally paranoid to the bone. Anything else I can do?


Sadly I don't know how to do this. I'm using Window's Resource Monitor a lot, is that functionality included there?

It's a 5850. It's also strange that I had to look at the video card sticker to find that out, everywhere I looked (even at the AMD video software) it just said 5000 series.
I understand where you're coming from, but the point is that I'm getting a free box to leave a miner running. No questions asked. Even if it's 0.001 BTC per day I'll be satisfied in the long run, provided of course it doesn't inconvenience the said friend of mine, which is why I made this thread.

Wut, I thought the first conference was in London.


This is a great one-liner, which ironically disputes the necessity of a foundation.
Furthermore. As Jon Matonis pointed out in the comments:


But I can't help but wonder: How will the Bitcoin Foundation prevent all of those things which the development group is supposedly not immune from, and how will the foundation guarantee that? If we take this a bit further, how is the foundation itself not immune for those things?

But what if, suppose 200 years from now, address miners will continue mining from now. Now suppose there will also be more addresses which hold more Bitcoins, wouldn't it be at least viable that some collisions occur?
Or is it possible that the 160-bit hash can be replaced for a higher bit hash?
@_date: 2012-11-05 11:37:26


Yes, that's what I meant with black markets and black exchanges. With enough turmoil BTC will be as illegal as CP. What will happen then? Exactly.
@_date: 2012-10-22 15:33:01
Ok, I'm only beginning to grasp the concepts of crypto, so do I need to know what PKE is prior to understanding this? I already know what hashing is (basically an algorithm that makes a signature from given data).
@_date: 2012-09-13 13:44:36
And yet I still don't understand what kind of mathematical problem the miners are solving :(
@_date: 2012-10-04 13:55:46
You mean things like day trading and arbitrage? Wouldn't that be inevitable given the market which exists now?
@_date: 2012-11-06 00:18:55
This is something I have trouble understanding. The reason the Bitcoin community is urging adaptation is because it has a positive effect on its price and stability. Wouldn't this hypothetical scenario which I wrote cause the price to plummet, or does it simply have to do with supply and demand (demand increases, supply drops because of regulations etc.) ?
@_date: 2012-10-23 23:09:14
Maybe he's referring to heaps of Bitcoins that early adopters still have.
@_date: 2012-09-26 17:07:42

@_date: 2012-11-03 21:43:27
Oh, I guess that's kind of unfortunate if you want to build systems on top of the blockchain.
So hypothetically, is it possible for the miners to agree on a minimum transaction fee?
@_date: 2012-11-05 04:38:32
The entertainment industry is deeming the Internet as a threat. In some cases they've been pretty successful in taking away freedom of completely unadulterated Internet usage. Same thing with governments and CP.
So from this line of thinking there arises the next question: What will financial institutions (which are, let's face it, far more powerful than governments) do when they'll collaboratively see Bitcoin as a threat, especially when ECB is already hinting towards exactly that? Just sayan...
@_date: 2012-09-12 08:07:01
How would this be different from localbitcoins or bitcoin-otr?
@_date: 2012-09-26 10:32:36
So how would this work? 
For example I want to borrow some BTC in order to buy the new BFL Single ASIC miner, but I've never borrowed before. What information should I present so that I would become eligible for lending and how is this different from GLBSE.com way of asking for investment?
@_date: 2012-11-03 19:25:48
But I thought that Bitcoin transactions could also be done without a fee? Then what's stopping the nodes to just reject the fee-less transactions?
@_date: 2012-09-30 02:03:00
A couple of months?
@_date: 2012-10-11 10:39:27

Nice, thanks!
@_date: 2012-10-23 01:51:56
Oh, that's a bit less then. But what actually stops people from (solo) mining addresses, then checking to see if they're valid and thereby steal Bitcoins?
@_date: 2012-09-21 17:53:39


Oh cool, that sounds like just what I need. So you're saying Poclbm's default behavior is to basically mine only at idle time? Or do you have special flags setup?
I've tried playing Tribes: Ascend with GUIminer with CUDA enabled but the frame rates sucked pretty hard, perhaps I should take a look at those aggressiveness flags.

Hoarding? Please do consider this particular scenario for a moment:
Let's say your 2 bitcoins became 10x more valuable. You're all like... totally awesome, dude!
You still work at that guitar shop because you like listening to Iron Maiden all day. But those dudes pay you in regular oldskool money. A bummer, but still you gotta pay all those government stuff and you don't want to cash out your 2 bitcoins yet. That's like totally understandable.
Now one day you hear that Iron Maiden is coming to town! As soon as you hear it you start to air guitar the intro of The Trooper. What's even more, they give a 5% discount when people purchase tickets with bitcoin. You say to yourself "That's radical man! But I don't want to cash out those hard earned bitcoins just yet!"
Well, it just so happens to be that there's an online exchange where you can buy bitcoins from your bank account very easily at very low rates. So you buy the ticket with bitcoins and then instantly re-buy the amount of bitcoins that you've spend on that exchange.
This way, you get the discount, you maintain your 2 bitcoins AND you get to air guitar to Iron Maiden... LIVE!!!
And that day was your most excellent day.

Actually, I think the fact that they seemed friendly to OP might say something about their level of comprehension towards Bitcoin. If they truly understand its implication on a macro socio-economical scale (as they were perhaps convinced by OP's pitch), then they might keep him friendly in case he becomes well versed in the Bitcoin universe. If I ran a business and I wouldn't know anything about the future moving &amp; shaking technologies, I would surely rely on people who are.

It would be very interesting to have the former tbh.

I think I get it now. So the spammy 'dust' transactions just won't get relayed with the standard clients (configs). But that doesn't say anything about other clients.
Does it mean that if I still want to send such a micro tx, that tx will eventually get confirmed by clients who do accept those tx's? I'm sure that adding IP's of miners who are able to confirm those tx's is an option to doing it too, but is the only benefit that of speed of confirmations?

So if (rather: when) we get more ASICs on board and significantly increase our collective hashrate, can this decision get reversed?

Yes, I did receive those Satoshis. [Is it usually sent from one fixed address though?](

Thanks. I've understood that the auctions on Bitcointalk are only for huge buyins of shares (like 10 shares+). Maybe I'll look into the PT shares thing on btct.co but then again I'm really weary of risking my BTC for shares managed by other people.

Ok, want a debunk? Here's a debunk.


Let's get something very clear from the beginning. Bitcoin, by it's very design is *not* like most e-currencies. The method which  authorities used to shut down Liberty Reserve's e-currency would be pointless against Bitcoin. The only way to shut down Bitcoin is a 51% attack, or shutting down the entire Internet. So yeah, no. Bitcoin can't just 'go'.


Let's not forget nation-state armies. Ultimately, those armies protect the treasures of countries. If they didn't, another country could bust into your country, take the money, and walk away with it. I don't know of an army willing to send a soldier to recover a stolen Bitcoin.
This article sure does concentrate on 'real' money and the institutions that govern it. Let me ask you something, what makes a piece of paper with a bunch of numbers and drawings printed on it suddenly so... real? Just because a few government and private institutions say so?
Why don't we not just take the liberty and use gold as an example of a real store of value. You know, because *it can't be reproduced but only mined* (which requires pretty hard work these days, mind you). Why is it that you can't keep gold reserves in your house? It's your value isn't it? Perhaps the government and financial institutions can't control gold the same way they can control the fiat money? 
Store some government backed printed papers and nobody will bat an eye, store something of real value and government goes apeshit.


Again, that's one of the caveats of greater control. Either way, when (yes, note how I say *when* and not *if*) a system or service arrives built on top of Bitcoin, specialized in providing you more security as a trade-off from control, your example can just as well apply to Bitcoin-backed assets.


Again, Bitcoin is NOT like most e-currencies. Good luck trying to hack into my offline generated paper wallet.


It's ironic to say that the very 'fiduciary entity' is charge of protecting the 'real' money is the same one who is destroying it.

From what I've understood about the startup scene, is that instead of actually good ideas and products, VCs and accelerators (which to my knowledge is the same thing) only fund companies which have a profitable exit strategy.
Nevertheless this is definitely good new for Bitcoin.

I'm not an expert (and certainly haven't worked at NASA lol), but this project seems to hit the spot when talking about things which could benefit sustainable seasteading. If I understand this correctly, the plan is to build autonomous factories which in turn build autonomous factories, so kind of like the [RepRap project]( but on a MUCH bigger scale.
I have no idea how I can contribute, but I'm definitely keeping an eye on this.

I'm not comfortable with investing 96% of my savings on Bitcoin, but I believe that Bitcoin is the future.


I believe that the founding father of Bitcoin had a very good philosophy about how the financial system could be repaired to work better. I think that a lot of people consider Bitcoin to be a win-win technology, and even if they can, they won't mess up this progression for the rest of us. I trust the hacker ethos.


Indeed, indeed it is.
@_date: 2013-05-13 17:37:37
Thanks for the heads up. I'm currently looking into buying 3 BTC worth of shares. How can I do it in such a way that I would have total control over the shares. Alternatively, if the former thing is not (a feasible) option, what shares managers are the safest and most reliable?
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:06:23

Can the 64 chip ASIC be installed on a PCB which goes into a PCI(e) port in a desktop and get powered by molex connectors or something like that? That would be really awesome, because in that case (no pun intended) I won't need another case for the ASIC board.

Thanks for coming by and replying :)


I mean in BTC terms. The dollar equivalent (so the value?) you pay for a share right now is around $332. If the BTC price tomorrow would get to $1000 the translated share price in BTC will be somewhere around 0.8 BTC right?


Right, so the dollar equivalent value of the dividends I will receive will stay the same, but the value will go down if expressed in BTC.


Sorry, I failed to mention that I only wanted to isolate the rise of the dollar value of BTC. Nevertheless if we consider the spike in mining demand, we can also say that it will attract competitors who will saturate the market (and arguably somehow have an effect on bringing down dividend payouts). But let's keep those things separate for the sake of the example.


Although in many cases that would mean good news, for those looking at it in terms of BTC it would take longer to get a return of investment.
Sorry if I may have worded it poorly but English is not my native language :(
@_date: 2013-06-10 17:35:40
Very understandable. In that case I might even volunteer to help out :)

In an ideal world there can never be a surplus of ideas.
As of now the barrier is the code and time which would get invested in an idea, but once the code becomes easy for even a 5-year old to write you will see a paradigm shift never seen before.

What if that payout was from someone wanting me to believe that I owned the shares?
Devious but still, 
1. Pay someone 0.02 BTC per share as 'dividend payout'.
2. Let that person think (s)he has the shares.
3. Get full share price from that person.
4. ???
5. Profit!!!

How? So friedcat must be sending dividends from a fixed address? I received the Satoshis from 115tTroRo3B9ZDQ6ATJGDCHcNEVbjJoZnF and received the 'actual' dividend payments from 1P8T4gvT7Tkjn8mLZboCUnftuDpYShqw4S

This is EXACTLY what I need right now. I have an idea about a potentially really big service for a good month now, constantly thinking about it and finalizing it in my head. This could very well make my idea into a reality.
Since this is a beta I assume that the developers of this project are a bit flexible in adding features (and I'm not bad in coming up with good features). I'm also pretty good in adding documentation.
So if I say that I wouldn't mind if you lodged that link in my direction would be a gross understatement :)
