I lost ~50 bitcoins.
Why would I put any faith back in Mtgox now, given:
* The history of poorly handled errors
* The magnitude of this loss
* How awfully the loss has been handled so far

44 coins. 
I bought some coins with $300 about 3 years ago. I think it was about 16 coins. I then started mining and got up to about 35. I then put them on Gox and guessed some of the declines and rises and raised it up to about 55 coins. My girlfriend then gave me $2k to get her some coins, which was about 3 coins at the current price.
When it hit about $1100 I converted the coins back into fiat. I believe in bitcoin, but I've got some messes to clean up. I'd been talking to an accountant about the best way to get it out in tax purposes, because I've got a fairly substantial tax debt from recovering from 4 or so years of major depression and structuring it right might help a lot.
Then the most recent shit hit the fan and I bought back in at about 800 or so, hoping it was just a bump in the road and I could profit a bit from the panic. I ended up with 44 coins in the account, which I guess are gone now. 
Hopefully I'll see some of it back eventually, those coins were going to go a long way towards repairing the damage I did to my finances from neglect during my period of mental illness. I really wish I'd just drawn the funds out as soon as I cashed out rather than dilly dallying and getting advice on how to handle it best...

If you knew anything about KYC you would know that the blockchain is nothing like the data preserved in KYC. I ran the product divisions for an online payments company for nearly a decade, I would know.

Hey, I've held bitcoin since 2011. Pity they're in Mtgox tho.
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:39:42
Yet they only have a tiny piece of information, compared to what is required to be retained under KYC.

They adopt it when it is actually superior to them, not in some abstract way. And that comes from ux, general acceptance, and usability.

I'm no expert but if you want to start on the legality, start with KYC regulation.

ICOs have one purpose - to put early mining wealth in the hands of the creator. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 09:17:53
Uh... I'm kind of astonished this is even a question.
* Significant problems with graft, where in a single party state you need to grease someone to get anything done
* Huge suppression of journalists and speech in general
* Any kind of opposing figurehead, such as the Lamas of Tibet or democracy advocates routinely get placed under house arrest or disappeared.
* Great firewall to block anything they don't want coming in and out of the country via the internet
* Anti-corruption efforts are for face only, and primarily target enemies of those in power
* They employ people to post pro-China comments online and pay them per post
Pretty much textbook State corruption. When they start cleaning up their practices and going after their own corrupt individuals, maybe they can improve. But I won't hold my breath.

And you're significantly more likely to fuck it up, because you are not a lawyer.
Honestly if you have any assets your advice is as dumb as a box of hammers.

It's much much more complicated than that. The primary reasons that governmente are trying to stop cash payments and reduce large notes in circulation is to attack organised crime, and corruption.
I don't know why I'm bothering actually talking finance policy in the Bitcoin sub.

Bitcoin is not reasonably ready yet to compete with paypal. We are miles behind in usability.
@_date: 2011-12-07 01:05:03
Easier yes, but it has zero protective measures attached to it and is very laissez faire. This is unacceptable for the majority of the market. An escrow service might make this workable, but then why use bitcoin over credit cards/bank account access?
@_date: 2011-07-20 00:09:15
Here's the thing. You're going into business. In the business world there are many things you are accountable for, and it is not reasonable to expect complete privacy in that circumstance. 
Personally I would never invest in you without knowing who you are and checking out your background/record. Not everyone does this but you know what they say about fools and their money...

A spot for a constant that was motherboard slot cost would be nice.
I.e. if the base system cost $200 for four slots, you could put $50 in there and it would add to the cost of each card.

I am working on a product that'll offer btc to usd exchange, accessible through a mastercard debit card. To use the service you will need btc sitting in an e-wallet, which can be converted back and forth between other currencies via the market. The funds can then be drawn down to bank accounts or used via the debit cards we issue. 
The debit card/e-wallet side of the product has been working for a year or so and is solid.
This is something I am working on for my employer btw, not my own fly by night thing. I can't really say more at this point. When it's ready I will put the word out on the forum and here.

If you're not intimately familiar with it, read up on what can happen when the 'too big to fail' fail. When reading, consider that the world was a far larger place in 1929 and drastically less interconnected. 
It is hard to say just how disastrous a modern depression would be, but my feeling is it would be considerably worse and the consequences could be far reaching in a post-nuclear world.

I find that hard to believe. Either you're hell bent against megacorporations regardless of what they do, or you have some kind of personality clash with Buffett or Munger. In my opinion, they're absolute model corporate citizens. 


This is either complete facetious bullshit, or intentional misdirection.

Edit: A preface on bitcoin &amp; Munger, of course he doesn't get Bitcoin. He's 89 years old, and he and Buffett have a mantra of only investing in things they understand. 
Did you even read the fucking article on Rolling Stone?
Your comment is precisely what I hate most about reddit. You know fucking nothing about the guy, and take Matt Tabibbi's opinion of all people about them. Tabibbi is the worst sort of yellow journalist who takes the thinnest shred of fact and writes bullshit designed to play at the desires of the financially ignorant to fuel his own status. 
Here is his example: "They must "suck it in and cope" and that they should "thank God" for bank bailouts." He the goes on to point out that BH made a $5b investment in Goldman Sachs at the height of the crisis. 
Here is what you're missing about Berkshire Hathaway's investment in Goldman Sachs at the height of the crisis: It was a massive move to help build confidence in the banking sector during the worst crisis since the Great Depression. Warren Buffett is known as the Oracle of Omaha for his sound management and solid investment over the course of more than 50 years, and he was leveraging his and BH's reputation to help stabilize the markets. BH stumped up $5b to stake Goldman Sachs and save them from insolvency, which due to their over-leveraged status and international entanglements would have triggered a global financial disaster of unprecedented scale. 
Berkshire Hathaway is a ~$270b company. You know what would cost Berkshire Hathway more than 5 billion dollars? A meltdown of the entire international economy. Charlie Munger getting on stage and saying that people should thank god for the bailout is because *be understands the consequences of what would have happened without one*. He is saying *suck it in* because **that is a sound thing to do in a recesssion**. 
You are a fucking idiot for calling Munger a looting central planner. But that's ok, you're just ignorant. What is far, far worse are ethically bankrupt people like Matt Tabibbi who understand why Berkshire did this, but uses his knowledge to whip up outrage at what are perceived easy targets by a generally public that is well out of their depth at understanding modern international finance.
