Those transactions were valid and paid the required fees. Otherwise they would have not been mined.

If writing on the blockchain becomes so expensive that only the banks will be able to do so, then fractional reserve banking might happen. The way to avoid this is that users control their private keys and transact directly, but with high transaction fees, that becomes more complicated.

I also thought about 2FA at first, but I think they are referring to using SMS for buying, selling and sending bitcoin.

The blog post doesn't mention anything about Shift cards. I would assume that Shift has an account at Coinbase, so these would be off-chain transactions. But I don't know.

Are you looking for a charitable company that will pay the miner fees for you? I wouldn't expect to find any, especially given how high the fees are getting.

I don't understand this reasoning. I think that Bitcoin's value comes from its usefulness. If Bitcoin becomes useless because moving it gets extremely expensive, how could it be worth more than digital tulips?

In the field where you usually paste the destination Bitcoin address, use instead the recipient's account e-mail address.

Your comment shows exactly how higher fees due to limited block size lead to increased Bitcoin centralization.

It's not that they offer off-chain transactions; I see that as a good thing in itself. It is that, if fees get too high because there is no block space and no real plans for scaling, then people would only be able to use Bitcoin through these companies.
It would be not different from PayPal, Venmo, etc., where transactions are subject to censorship. Even if there are 500 companies, as soon as your money has to go through a third party, it is subject to monitoring (KYC) and censorship. Bitcoin was supposed to avoid precisely that.

I, for one, am waiting for overwhelming consensus on Chinese miners to fork and make bigger blocks. This is the "certified letter" that many are waiting for.
