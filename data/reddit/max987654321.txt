Well you knew it couldn't be razors or deodorant!!   In all seriousness, that's very cool   Good news for the BTC world.  Now we just need them to stop converting back into USD.

Fuckface I'm gonna make it my duty to follow everyone of your asshole posts and call you out on it.  Do you really think your reply is warranted.  Now we all know how mentally superior you are to everyone else on the planet, so, with that out of the way, you can now shut your face.
The kid just lost his loot and you're kicking a man when he's down.
Oh and as I have said before...get back in the basement and keep it down...your Mom is trying to sleep!!
And to the OP...sorry for your loss!

Too funny.  This is my same response every time I see something along these lines.  I guess hackers have finally heard of apple now that they have 2% of market share.  
@_date: 2014-01-31 03:58:23
Yeah I almost wouldn't advertise that.  18,000 for a computer in a cabinet. I'd say they have some "wiggle" room.

Seems like a ploy to drive up their stock price.  Given they are "cleaning up their books" and just "relieved some toxic debt", I'd say they are looking  to cash in on the bitcoin phenomenon.  Given they have no details whatsoever as to what this new amazing site/app is, I'd say I am pretty close if not exact.

Tax haven no....the exact opposite...California! 75-85 every day and sunny...who cares how much tax....it's heaven!

I would have to disagree that trade volume being lower on gox has anything to do with the stabilizing value of btc.  A more likely scenario is the lack of liquidity on gox. But hey no press is bad press.

I like this idea.  Id donate to crowd fund it.  Z5 had a point I am not sure intended to in that a commercial is only as useful as the product...and from my POV it is.  
@_date: 2014-02-13 05:00:51
Wait ....I thought there was no malware/viruses for apple products.  You mean the marketing that told me it's utopia in all things apple wasn't true?  I feel lied to.

Nice!  I'm in cincy so I'm gonna stop by and by my first meal with btc.  
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:26:31
Dammit!  I literally just got my approval to buy 50k per day!  I had planned on buying 50k USD worth in one fell swoop but maybe that's not a good idea.  I'm going to have to re-evaluate my "buy all at once" strategy.  
@_date: 2016-06-08 00:39:19
I assume that is sarcastic, but I'm being legit.  I've purchased BTC as an investment several times over the years, but I assumed the volume was higher these days that 50k wouldn't explode the exchanges, but I guess that was incorrect.  If anyone has any tips on buying 50k without making the market, lemme know. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 02:38:04
Oh really?  I thought bitpay only handled payments for btc--&gt;USD.  Thanks for the tip, I will check with them.  And yes it is legit serious.  It represents a small portion of what I have invested in vanguard index funds.  I want to diversify into btc just because I believe it represents a good opportunity.  Not sure if it will pan out, but if not, I'll be ok.  Not necessarily happy, but I won't be destitute. At this point I doubt it goes to zero, though.  My .02 is btc will be a refuge for those with inflation concerns.  E.g. China.  And it always will be a place to hide, so hopefully that mean longevity and increasing value.

I'll believe it when I see it.

Fuckface...get back in your room.  You're keeping your mom awake.

I tried to find a link to the cold wallet instructions on liteaddress.org but couldnt find it.   Just a couple questions:
Did you encrypt a USB or external drive?
Did you use keyfiles or just a password?
I assume you have tried mounting the drive from a different computer running True Crypt.   If not, that may be an option, but I assume you have explored that already.
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:00:57
Heck with the exception of the Apple-Sony prediction...pretty much all of these spell good things for BTC.
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:59:05
Now all we need is the red balloon to accept btc so I can stock up on stink bombs and gags.  Tell me the red balloon is still in business?
I lived in Juneau back in the late 80's as a kid.
Is this near downtown?  Could be a very busy place depending on its location.  
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:33:55
I remember seeing several posts back in 2012 saying something to the effect of "Bitcoin going over $1000, and not just that, but in 2013, what a crock of shit to laugh at."
Never say never.   It's just a prediction anyway.  That doesn't make it definitive.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:10:13
How's that funny?
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:11:13
Followed this some more just for fun....It lead me to here:  and then ultimately to here:     There seems to be more this Sheep Market scam than just Sheep Market.   That or the scammer got scammed by Sheep Market down the road.   
@_date: 2013-12-03 03:08:37
So what happened to the other 4,000 BTC?   Would that have gone to transaction/tumbling fees?   Or could it be the thief took that money for him/herself and left the rest to deal with at a later time.  My theory may be full of holes, but isn't it possible he/she sent the 92k BTC to some random wallet as a distraction and then kept the less easily traced 4k in BTC?   Heck I'd take 4k in BTC as a payday for this heist.
