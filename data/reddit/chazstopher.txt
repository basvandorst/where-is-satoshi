Have you personally made any money off buying and selling on the app?
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:12:07
Yeah it seems really simple and convenient.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:06:14
So did you make any profit from selling on the app?
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:28:29
Damn that's crazy. So how much money did you make all together? And I'm kinda confused on how the app works. Do you get a separate card specifically for the cash app or do you put the money you made back on your debit card?
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:37:35
Woah that's awesome. So how does the separate card work? Do you get it shipped to you or something?

Yeah there's basically no fees at all but they probably sell at a higher rate than other exchanges. It seems way more simple than coinbase though.

You can withdrawal Bitcoin to any other wallet you want.  but you can't deposit any onto the app. You can only sell Bitcoin on the app that you bought from it

Do you think now would be a good time to buy? It seems to have been going up and down very drastically these past couple days.
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:16:23
Right. I just wanna know if anyone's ever been able to make some money on the app lol if so then I'll definitely be trying myself
@_date: 2019-05-19 15:52:18
That seems really cool. Is there anyway to just put the money you made from selling Bitcoin on the app back into your bank account on your debit card ?
@_date: 2019-05-13 12:04:33
Why are they banning them ? That's pretty outrageous.
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:45:46
I've watched a couple tutorials of people selling on it. It looks like it's been an option for awhile
@_date: 2019-05-19 14:43:56
There's an option to sell on the app.
