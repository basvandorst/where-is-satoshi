That's awesome! Tribeca is a fantastic debut. This will hopefully give people a clear picture of bitcoin's history and potential future. 
I'm hoping our Life on Bitcoin documentary gets as warm a reception. We saw a rough cut a couple weeks ago, and we're all pretty excited. Still a lot of work to do, but it should be completed in Spring some time.

Austin again.
Oh man. Crowdfunding presents a huge opportunity, but it is *hard*, no matter what. 
I've worked on three crowdfunding campaigns. It's a ton of hustle to make it work. 
There are a ton of resources out there on crowdfunding. One of my favorites is RocketHub's "Success School"

Hey, this is Austin, Beccy's husband. 
Most of the restaurants that accepted bitcoin from us still accept it, and several other stores in our area have started accepting it since we finished our experiment! Sadly the grocery store that we were working with no longer accepts bitcoin. It didn't work very easily with their registers. The only reason we were able to do it was because they gave us a special account that they usually reserve for corporations, that we could pay out at the end of the month. 
Hopefully as POS terminals all eventually migrate to smart platforms, that kind of obstacle will disappear.

We actually had a hard time finding everything we needed/wanted payable in bitcoin (hence the challenge of the film). I think we have a long way to go before it's *too* easy to spend it.

I'm guessing you have specific projects in mind, which I couldn't really comment on unless you name them.
My own personal opinion is that we've gone through a hype cycle, and interest will absolutely come back up. It will just take a while. In the meantime, it might be hard to crowdfund.
@_date: 2015-05-26 19:19:46
Thanks! What problem would there be? If it's easy to spend, then we'll see wider adoption. I'm not sure I understand the question.

Dude, were you going to sell your savings this year? They're your *savings*, right? Save them, keep the BTC, and expect a recovery. Anybody who has been in crypto for a few years has absolutely seen this show before. It'll recover, like it always has. Count on it.

What is this image from?

I heard a story of somebody who bought an old bank, then found old and uncirculated coins between and under the floor boards. Check and see if maybe another fortune is in there!

Rarely, and only after exhausting *every* other possibility to buy directly with bitcoin. Check out the film, it's pretty well documented: 
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:43:30
Like everybody, in hindsight, not as much as I'd like.
@_date: 2017-07-27 06:12:43
Why not both?
@_date: 2017-07-27 19:44:59
Valid — But didn't exist when we did this (2013).
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:56:06
Valid. I wanted the film to be available in bitcoin, but the distribution group wasn't ready to take that leap.

Hey all, this is Austin of Life on Bitcoin. The doc has taken much longer than we expected or wanted, but it isn't dead by any means. We're (all of us) first time feature filmmakers, and we're figuring out literally every part of this as we go along. Beccy and I are actually viewing the latest cut tonight, and while I can't announce anything official, we're in talks right now to schedule the premier... soon. We should have been more in touch, with weekly updates. There's really no excuse for not doing that, though we've been juggling our regular jobs through this whole experience. This year you'll have the movie available, one way or another. Thanks for sticking with us, and we hope you like the finished product when we release it.  
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:53:43
Well yeah, that was what we were doing. You can see the trailer for the documentary about it here: 
@_date: 2017-07-27 03:00:12
For reasons I won't go in to here, working with the distribution group was absolutely necessary.

TL;DR — Him: "If bitcoin is so great, why don't you try living and traveling on it!" Me: "I did."

Hey all. I'm Austin, the guy half of Life on Bitcoin. To clarify, I don't own Orapup. Or Orabrush. It's a company I've worked with for four years, but I'm not an investor, I'm not an executive. I'm the spokesman and a member of the creative development team there. Accepting bitcoin was never a decision I'd be able to make at the company, it's something the board and executives would have to decide. And as anybody who has run a company knows, you can't do everything. They've actually been super supportive of Life on Bitcoin. They've allowed me to take time off to work on the project, and they're paying me in bitcoin for the reduced hours I am working now. Maybe they will accept bitcoin some day, but for now, there doing quite a lot to support the cause in other ways. Honestly, this project would be a lot harder without their support.

In my experience, it's good to hand them something. Leaving something in their hand gives them something to see and think about later. I made a pamphlet to hand out to merchants considering bitcoin. It's a very basic overview, but hopefully it helps.
It also makes a big difference what kind of merchants you're approaching. Here are the kind of businesses I've had success with.
