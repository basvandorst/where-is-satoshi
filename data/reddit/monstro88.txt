And rolling down hills like its stockmarket namesake.

This is all 'bear'-faced lies and bullshit

Great, so now bitcoin is Amway?

Even amongst these students the three main mindsets are already emerging - one says it's a decentralised currency for free trade, another says it's an investment, and the third disregards it as something criminals do.

Thanks for sharing.

It can't move out of niche status if it's not being circulated to new users, though. Hodlers are sitting on a bubble. If it's not being used as a currency (the way things were intended), then it can never become globally accepted. Any possible "gold" status has to come later, after there has been enough common trade to make BTC a dependable and valuable commodity in the eyes of the common man.

Crypto adoption is nice and all, but I wish they'd pour their efforts into actually getting mail delivered cheaply and on-time. You know. Like a post office.

My Bitcoin is happy with its current gender, thank you.

Thanks CNBC. Cue  the entry of timid, excitable mum and dad investors into the market who will bring a sharp spike and sudden crash in the price. It'll recover, but it will break some people along the way.

...but... what's Bitcoin got to do with this? 
@_date: 2017-05-28 21:27:34
I don't get it. How do slaves spend their debt?
