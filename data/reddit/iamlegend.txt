I am really feeling the pain of everyone affected here, its a terrible situation but i would just ask people to zoom out &amp; see the bigger picture in this situation.
Think of it like this! everyone has their own safety box in a bank. you cant take from one safety box to compensate another if the bank was robbed, this is the simplest way to see it from a legal point to view at a fundamental level.
By having segregated wallets each user is putting his BTC in that wallet at his own risk, there is no pool of btc, everyone has their own wallet, its not any different to using a Mycelium online wallet, if they had BTC stolen from 20 wallets they would not be able to go into another 50 wallets to compensate the stolen ones. that would be stealing in itself.
Once you take from someone that can clearly see from his segregated wallet nothing was stolen that is theft.
Bitfinex will pick the legally viable option. the lesser of 2 evils which at this point seems best for each segregated wallet be liable for his/her own loss.
when you store your BTC on an exchange or an online wallet you do it at your own risk &amp; should not expect others to be responsible.
At this point there is 3 options which bitfinex could consider to get out this situation.
A) The business valuation was over 200million before the hack, lets say its now only worth 80 million, that would cover all of the stolen funds, so effectively they hand over the business to a new owner for free but he does a bailout &amp; reimburses all the losses,
The business would actually be more successful long term as you would know the security will be improved drastically &amp; they were honest &amp; decent enough to return your losses which is rare the world in any situation like this.
B) Do a deal with the hacker, the entire world is watching his address, it would be almost impossible for him to sell those coins in the market or it would be many years before he could sell a good chunk. offer him 20million to return the 120k BTC,
 If he returns the funds &amp; finex dont press charges a good lawyer could argue the entire thing was in good faith to demonstrate to bitfinex vulnerabilities as all coins have been returned. 
I hope if the hacker is reading this he understands karma is everything in life, what goes around comes around, if he has an ounce of decency in him he will take a lump some from escrow or finex &amp; return the coins.
C) Do some kind of Bitfinex ICO, give the users shares in the company which they can cashout down the road but for now they should get returns in BTC from the Bitfinex earnings on a quarterly bases.
All of the above options are better than the Company going bankrupt. All customers should keep in mind why we were trading on Bitfinex in the first place, good customer service, good security, great website interface &amp; functionality.
I sincerely hope they make it through this &amp; i will remain a loyal customer knowing they did the right thing &amp; the fact that security will be taken up to the next level is itself a good reason to stay with bitfinex, at the end of the day i was using bitfinex because they were the best option from all the western exchanges. 
Nothing changes there, i hope to be trading on Bitfinex again soon.
