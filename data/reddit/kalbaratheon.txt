What exactly is this for?

Yes it is insensitive. And no it isn’t a choice. You’re trying to postulate as if you’re some enlightened, neutral thinker who can see the true reality of the circumstance, but you’re not. You just come off as someone trying too hard to be intellectual. The people were **forced** into slavery. Do you understand the meaning of the word force?? Yes, I’m also sure that if they knew their future they would choose to do something about it, but that’s beside the point. Let’s put this in a different perspective. Say a girl gets jumped, kidnapped and gang raped by some guys. It’s her choice to get gang raped right, according to you?? She could choose to fight and get killed right?? She just doesn’t have the balls right?? 
You need to grow up. You’re criticizing me as if I don’t see the reality of things but you’re over here minimizing slavery as some choice. Where tf do you “sunshine and rainbows” from my argument?? 
Yes you did. Stop lying. You may not have literally said it but it’s certainly what your argument inherently implies. So, in your mind, based on YOUR argument, the slaves who didn’t fight back didn’t have the balls to do so. Because it was their choice to be slaves. Women who don’t fight back against rapist didn’t have the balls. Because it was their choice to get raped. 
You’re dense.

It's all good man, fair enough.

So, I guess the first people forced into chattel slavery weren’t concerned enough with their freedom to die for it?? Then their kids, who grew up in it, liked the life too much to die to escape from it?? And this all went on for nearly 250 years, just a period of people who made the “*choice*”to be slaves simply because, what, they didn’t have he balls to die for their freedom?? Do you understand how stupid, insensitive, and entitled that sounds??
