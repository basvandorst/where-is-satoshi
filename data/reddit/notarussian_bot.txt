I've been holding for quite some time now, paper wallet in the gun safe. I picked a hell of a week to start getting interested again. I wish I drank beers cause this is one hell of a roller coaster.
Last time I even cared about my stash it was at $500 these are crazy happenings.

It's cute you still think Bernie was a choice and the Clinton Foundation didn't have their shit bought and paid for, acting like the "loss" really mattered to him.
"Net Neutrality" is the Fairness Doctrine re-branded for idiots and paid shills to "support organically"
How was your internet in 2015, why do we NEED net neutrality, because people tell you everything will change without it? Political FUD for imbeciles. Anything Obama and Sorors are FOR is bad for all Americans.
Obama was worth 7 million before office, 50 after. Clintons 2 million - after 200 million, Pelosi 75 million, Waters 35 Million. What do these incompetent thieves have to sell? Only one thing, influence.
Trump 4.5B before, 3.5B after. Used all his own money, really activates the old almonds.

In an apt it might be harder because you don't own it, But you could just run a bunch of copper tubing under a sub floor. Like a big PC water cooler. Put a small pump in to circulate, pressure and temp gauge. All set.

An entire post full of hypothetical bullshit that never happens. Great reason for more government regulations. FFS
Before Obama healthcare was not being cancelled across the nation, entire states having no option to pick healthcare. Oh, but that's not the dindu nuffins in the city, so I guess it doesn't matter when 75% of rural America has one plan to choose from .. oh.. kinda sounds like government regulation failed there. But lets trust them with our internet also.

Look at all those sources to go with your pathetic liberal BS.. oh wait.. none.
You entire argument is invalid when the left thinks there is more than two genders. Not to mention your "most qualified candidate" lost to the "buffoon" Trump.

I've put 6 figures through coinbase, not a single problem. Only small issue was a 4 day delay on a wire during the bull rush. Cost me profits, but I didn't lose anything.

The worst part about shooting home intruders is accidentally using a nice gun, when the cops book it for evidence and fucking lose it.
8/10 would kill another burglar.
