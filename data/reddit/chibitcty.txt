Around 1.2BTC or 1.4BTC with quite a few considerations deciding which side of this they’d fall in, or even out of (higher).

This is absolutely not true. Why would you make something like this up if you really didn’t know? You can find Casascius coins that are loaded for under $2,000 ( .1BTC silver coin versions are the most affordable option). There are MANY worth less than $30,000. Bro your info is way off.

Physicalbitcoin.com (bitcointalk website) is hands down the number once place on the globe to buy / sell / trade physical bitcoins. This is where both BitBills (first ever loaded physical bitcoin item , which is a plastic wallet card) and Casascius (first ever loaded bitcoin coin) were announced.
@_date: 2019-07-27 06:05:17
2011 BitBills the first ever loaded physical representation, which were plastic wallet cards, were announced here. 2011 Casascius the first ever loaded physical bitcoin coins were announced here. The first ever known physical versions (not loaded) were also first listed here.  BitBills and Casascius coins are the two most sought after physical bitcoin items to this day. Never once has one been breached by the makers. Many others exist as well and continue to be made, some loaded, others not. 
With all the miss information here (it’s a scam, it’s fake, they’re all worth $30k or more, they don’t exist, etc etc),  I thought I’d share some legitimate info and resources.
@_date: 2019-07-27 05:35:29
Anduck that you? If so what’s up bud! If not, Anduck is a buddy of mine and I can vouch for them being a legit seller on btalk.
@_date: 2019-07-27 05:46:21
True, but there are makers whom are well know ( like
Mike Caldwell / Casascius ) that are very well known and trusted. Made coins since 2011 and not one has been touched. Among others. You have to know what you’re doing and what’s what to buy these smartly. Visit  for a look at the world of physical crypto

People really should take in to account that the person gambling can afford to invest for their retirement properly, maintain a healthy lifestyle, as well as bet a few satoshis for fun. Not everyone who gambles is a degenerate. You CAN do both. Most people waste their money on worse and not all gambling is a 1 in 100000 odds. Odds can also be 50-50 or 40-60 etc.  Just because it doesn’t suit you doesn’t mean it’s not okay for others. Now if they can’t afford to do so then it’s their fault and then you can judge if they take themselves in to ruin or whatever.  Until then no one cares to hear it. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:27:56
I’m aware of it, proves nothing still

Probably not. Speaking English ..likely. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:23:03
FUD and more of it.  As for Alts-Andreas says it best “to think there will only be one surviving cryptocurrency in the end is like thinking the world will move to a single language” (paraphrasing).

The name does not matter, call then hard-soft wallets if you wish. You’re right, but you need to understand that people in general struggle mightily fo even grasp the concept of cryptocurrency.  We are EARLY in the game, and right now these wallets are massively important for the majority of people whom simply don’t have the intelligence, knowledge, skills, desire or devices to create “paper wallets” safely.  I can’t even talk half my friends out of hodling coins in hot wallets and on exchanges to save my life..even after telling them of fork loss potential. 
It’s not ridiculous.  Most people have little tech and financial savvy and these discussions help others learn. Cool man you know your stuff..how about help teach others and not be a know it all? 
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:07:53

An explanation as to maybe why these super smart dudes say dumb things.
By the man himself - 
"I think many of the intellectually honest people eventually stop being critics, because they suddenly realize that the flaws they are identifying are temporary features, issues, and not inherent problems. There are very few inherent problems in a dynamically evolving design or ecosystem of different designs all competing, that cannot be resolved.  There are critics who criticize this technology primarily based on their world view.   It is politically inconsistent with their world view.  It’s not that they do not like the technology it’s that they do not like the implications of this technology and the primary criticism you get then is “this should not be” to which all I can answer is ..and yet it is.  “but we mustn’t”… and yet we did, “but you shouldn’t”.. but yet we did"- Andreas Antonopoulos.
@_date: 2018-05-12 21:33:03
Trezor hands down the best option besides...IF...you know what you’re doing, paper wallets. ..BUT.. most are not equipped well enough to make paper wallets properly.  Ledgers/KeepKeys are okay, but inferior to Trezor when it comes to security, user friendliness, hardware , etc. 
Best hot wallets IMO (for intermediary use)-Mycelium and Bread 
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:55:02
I wasn’t necessarily disagreeing but making a point, but your reply makes complete sense. I just know both are equally crooked.
Mr Robot stuff was just for fun, as I figured many of us here are fans ..but I’d recommend researching true anonymous members. I think you’ll find that show to be quite realistic (season 1 more so that is). Of course it’s overblown at points, that’s Hollywood. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 11:50:47
This is very fair, well said! I’ll admit, I am biased because I think the world of him and normally those who talk ill of him..are clueless.
However ..is it really fair to punish a man (even just in your own mind) who’s likely taught more people about bitcoin than anyone else. After grinding for years for free, for a cause he felt extremely just, to better the world ..does he not deserve to be paid the same way  like 99% of us here? I hate government corruption and the almighty dollar too, but you can’t live without it just yet. The guy posts YouTube videos and takes questions even, for free..almost daily. Andreas is not needed as much as he once was ( still very much needed however-imo), and he deserves to be paid at this point, handsomely. IMO. I just don’t get such dislike. 
Yes , please share background. Very interested now. No rulers in this convo I promise! Lol 
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:41:24
Nano nor anything else is battle tested close to bitcoin.  All the inflow and outflow bitcoin has taken on is immense. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 00:44:29
The problem is much of America is highly uneducated on this stuff, nor cares to read in to it. They live in their government created bubbles and just worry about themselves. 
I hear you, but as an FA by trade, I’ve seen the banks run dirty businesses first hand for years. The Fed and their sickening amount of debt, much of which is completely unjustified..I agree, they are a disease.
My bit of hope - millennials take a lot of slack for anything and everything but no one seems to give them their due for being much more open minded in general which often turns to social and racial progression like we’ve never seen before. I have a lot of hope for “lazy” millennials making major change across all platforms.

No it is actually not. Kialara made what’s called the Thug Life Bill (  ). He was approached about its potential illegality and sought council. I can’t remember the specifics his lawyer gave him, but he found that it was in fact not illegal. Maybe it is in Europe, but not in the US.

Bitcoin is good for illegality ay? You might want to read up on Silk Road. That’s the oldest fallacy there is w/BTC. Sure you could argue Monero and Zcash are..though you’d be wrong again but it would be a much more legitimate argument.

The banking system platform in general is an absolutely antiquated dinosaur who also charges plenty of fees for all sorts of nonsense. Example - A guy has two Chase accounts. First it takes two days to transfer funds from one account to another. However, once you initiate the transfer of funds they read on the website that they are available for use...but really aren’t.  Try and spend those funds and get slapped with a big penalty, regardless of misleading information right there on the website. They charge $12 a month for a checking account (unless you’re paid by your employer directly to the account or meet a threshold amount) which is pure bs. Not all banks do this, but many do. Want to send funds to a family member in Italy? Sizable fee to do so.  Etc etc  
Have I quit using banks? Of course not. Cryptocurrency is in the first half of inning 1...it’s going to take time to get this all going in the right direction. Eventually an app will be created to make a lot of this much more streamlined, and my money is on banks adopting the Blockchain eventually to replace their extremely outdated systems.  
Not too long ago many of us somewhat older folk had never heard of the internet. Many doubted it for years as website functionality was seriously lacking &amp; and it was super slow. Now it runs the entire planet.

A decent chunk of this went way over my head! I appreciate all the info! But..my point is still the same. Internet mass adoption started mid 90s, not too long before that many schools had just set up their very first computer labs. I was in maybe 2nd or 3rd grade and will never forget when it was added to my school. Will never forget the first time I saw a group chat either ��.  My point here is that the internet took time to get things really going..just like it takes time to get a new found payment system going too. 
@_date: 2018-07-04 18:46:30
You’re looking to pick a fight, and looking a fool while at it. “Some bitcoin needs laundering “. That’s a highly intelligent statement if I’ve ever heard one.  Better though is “and of course you pay taxes, that’s the fucking point of laundering money”...lol

Those who are in their mid 30s now, were a part of the computer/internet mass adoption “kick off” The vast majority did not learn about it until the mid 90s- case in point you troll

Yes, thanks .. I’m am def aware that nothing ever “physically/digitally” leaves the b-chain. 
No, that is not true that they function more so as a cool looking toy or whatever it is you think. Cold Storage isn’t “hype”. It is not even debatable that the two safest ways to store your coins are first paper wallets and second hardware. Paper wallets are too hard for most to make properly, as well as it’s only a storage wallet. Hardware wallets like Trezor (Ledger is hot garbage) safely store offline as well as make it simple to move funds plus other random stuff (signing a sig, splitting off forks etc).  
Hot wallets are meant for the day to day crypto dealings but not storing all your coins on it. Esp when you aren’t the only one with access to private keys.

I sure don’t care about them, but many people sadly do.

Thanks for the info!  Here in America, land of corrupt gov/big business, it’s not the same.

This was my first BTC book and its author Andreas is a
Legend. He’s as good as it gets. HOWEVER..this book is geared towards coders. I am not that at all. I’d say I could understand 30-40% of the book. Andreas himself will tell you that if not a coder it’s probably not for you. I’d still recommend it TBH. Watch his YouTube too, epic stuff.

With out Bachman this show is simply as shell of what it once was.

So how was the internet doing after it’s first 10 years?
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:59:32
Np..if I can read 30-40% and still recommend it that should be telling right. You can’t go wrong by Andreas. No better person to learn from. Maybe Trevon James or Craig Grant ..binconnect superstars..but besides them! :)

I’ve got the book with me right now I’ll send a couple pics in a second. I think this book is a nice thing to have around period. For me I always reference back to it.
Hope that helps because wouldn’t have a clue how to answer your question lol

Bitcoin is not meant to be an investment.  These kinds of case studies are nonsense.
