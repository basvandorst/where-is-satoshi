Somebody pls hodl me, today has me so fucked up. Panic sold the dip and missed out on 1k+ prof. Obviously noone can predict what's going to happen but I'm currently conflicted between buying back in now / taking the loss, and waiting out a couple of weeks for sub-15k prices to buy back in. Thoughts?

I'm not an expert but from what I understand, futures can be bought and sold, and Wall Street will most likely be manipulating the market to profit in both cases. 
Say Billionairebrah buys a futures contract, committing to buy 1000 BTC at $20k each in 2 week's time. As long as they keep this contract and don't sell it, they are guaranteed this sale so it is in their interests that the price is greater than 20k in 2 weeks. So with all their billionaire friends, they agree to buy shitloads of BTC, drive the price / hype up, causing more investment from new naive investors trying to make a quick buck. 
On the other hand (and you're right, this is probably of greater concern), they could be accumulating shittonnes of BTC atm, preparing to sell futures. So they could sell a whole bunch of futures contracts to average investors, guaranteeing a bitcoin for 15k in 2 weeks time. In the mean time, they dump all the coins they've accumulated, causing the price to dip well below 15k and use the money they made from the futures to buy more BTC. And the snowball effect works in this case too; people panic sell, further driving down the price by an amount noone can anticipate.
Also remember buying / selling large amounts of bitcoin isn't the only way to manipulate its price. Wall street is likely to collude with people who have influence in the media / governments to manipulate the market in ways result in both of them profiting. The Chinese government is suspected to do this regularly, as well as executives (e.g. Jamie Dimon). With all these variables, you'd really need a time machine to be sure of the best strategy for the next few days
I'm sure there are many people on here who can explain what I'm trying to say much clearer / more accurately than what my limited understanding allows me to but basically, I am very scared and noone knows what the effect of the futures is going to be except probably the reptiles who are going to exploit them.

Halving doesn't cut the supply in half. It cuts the reward for mining in half

I guess but the comment "supply will be cut in half" is pretty ambiguous. It kind of implies half the coins will be burned
