I think he’s trying to meme @ all the people who say “coinbase is too high charging $1 for a $100 transaction who do they think they are”

I failed college math 4 times. But look at Amazon stock vs bitcoin/eth/litecoin/ETC stock if they had started the exact same day and you made $100 investment when they were both at $1 which would you had made more money on?

I use bitcoin to buy other coins that will give me an actual return. It’s simple maths a $100 investment in a legit coin around $1 in 20 years will make you multiple thousands of dollars but doing the same in the stock market will make you like $400

He’s not a scammer he’s a mentor. I’ve done his courses in the past and have made 6 figures with stuff he’s taught me. If you don’t want people to get wealthy by taking an entertaining class instead of googling it and learning it from some of the most boring people in existence or just reading up about it that’s fine but don’t fall into lies that known racist has spread about him. The people who called him scams are people whose known for hating Mexicans or people who don’t even have enough sense to come in out of the rain so don’t fall for the BS circle jerk dude! If you need more proof he’s not a scam watch the H3H3 podcast he went in some detail about people whose banged hardcore numbers off taking his courses. Remember just because some people are too stupid to make money off his class doesn’t mean it’s a scam because there are people out there who are too stupid to go to college and call college a scam too.
