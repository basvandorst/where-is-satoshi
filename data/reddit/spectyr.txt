Crash, don't crash.  Noodles, don't noodles.  Irrelevant questions.  What's the state of Bitcoin usage today?  Ironically high considering the reality.  I'm in the middle of trying to send a Bitcoin transaction that would have cost me $.04 to send, but would have taken approximately 50 minutes to confirm.  Instead, I chose to send it with high priority, costing me $.55, and supposedly confirming in approximately 20 minutes.  That was 45 minutes ago.  I'm sorry, gang, but we have a long way to go before this technology is useable in any real sense, which makes the current price of it still way too high.  It's too volitile to be a store of value for most people (Venezuela and other unstable national currencies not-withstanding), and it's almost unuseable in its current state as a currency. While it's true there's a lot of ***potential*** for some really impressive use cases, at the current time they're on the fringe of everyday use.  From where I stand, $6600/BTC is laughably overpriced.
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:22:49
I remain cautious.  Don't get me wrong, the technology is amazing and it solves a critical problem, but the implementation is still having trouble overcoming the barrier of complexity for the average user with encryption being at the root of it.  We've had encryption for years now, and it has traditionally been a very difficult concept to explain to average users.  So much so that the bulk of shifts towards encryption have come from knowledgeable people implementing it across entire services on behalf of their users.  PGP never took off.  Whole-disk encryption is only popular because it's mandated by business system administrators.  Even wifi router encryption has only progressed because manufacturers are setting WPA2 by default.  But I don't see Bitcoin being adopted through this kind of hand-holding technique because at the end of the day it's *real* money to people.  And if people don't understand how something works themselves, they're not going to trust it.  
I hope that the knowledgeable people that are encouraging Bitcoin continue making it more and more ubiquitous to encourage people to learn about it, but if we can't find a good way of *teaching* how this works in a simple way, I just don't see it going "viral".
@_date: 2014-01-23 16:05:07
From his perspective, I can understand this response.  
By his standards, Bitcoin ***is*** a terrible store of value.  If you were used to looking at the fluctuations in fiat currencies and then looked at Bitcoin's chart, you might conclude the same thing.  That says ***nothing*** about Bitcoin's *future* at being a good store of value.
And he's right to think that given the oppressive financial regulations *his* industry is made to endure that the government will naturally apply the same regulations to Bitcoin.  The problem is, he doesn't understand that there are very few places where the government can *apply* these regulations with regard to Bitcoin.  It's not centralized.  It's not a company.  He doesn't understand this yet.  
And of course he thinks it's just a vehicle for criminal enterprise.  He only seems to be getting the biggest news stories surrounding Bitcoin at the moment, and due to the news' sensationalist nature, the biggest blips for Bitcoin so far have been negative.  
All in all, I don't fault him for his ignorance about Bitcoin.  But I *will* be one of the many laughing at the dinosaurs of the financial system when the meteor of Bitcoin starts to hit atmo.

Not all numbers in the 2^256 range are on the mathematical curve used for finding a matching key to use as a public key.   After a number on the curve is found along with its matching pair, the ripemd160 hash is applied to the private key which yields a 160-bit number.  This introduces a loss in  precision for the original key, meaning that some ripemd160 hashes for 2 different 256-bit keys will be the same (called a collision).

@_date: 2014-06-04 14:18:07
Is the SHA256-&gt;RIPEMD160 hash process on the ***public*** key what introduces the loss of precision on the private key?  By that I mean I know the *effective* keyspace for a private key is only around 2^160 , but I thought that was because the *private key* was hashed to a 160-bit number.  What I understand you to be saying is that the loss of precision comes from the hashing of the public key that's derived from the private key, is that correct?  So basically, there are hashes of *public keys* that exist which would match multiple private keys?  If that is so, does that mean that if I send bitcoins to a public key that, in effect, there are more than 1 private keys that receive those bitcoins?

If that's the case, then perhaps there's no real concern here at all.  At the current transaction level, there doesn't seem to be any threat to Bitcoin.  Perhaps when Bitcoin is ready to start competing with the Mastercard or Visa network is when this will become an issue.  Still, why not explore ways of keeping people enthusiastic enough about Bitcoin to help support it wherever they can?  Maybe we don't need to directly incentivize everyone running a node, but why not make it just a ***little*** bit interesting for them?  What about for each block that gets awarded to a miner, a small portion of that block reward gets sent to the last full-node it communicated with, or something similar?  It wouldn't offset the costs of running a full node, but it might keep people interested enough to continue running a node. 
I think the Bitcoin network is an amazing achievement, and I hate to see it suffer a setback simply because the average user still doesn't understand its potential.

My pleasure.  Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-03-03 15:35:43
No such thing.  25 bitcoins are created about every 10 minutes as a reward for the miner who figures out the correct hash for that block.  That is to say, when bitcoins are created, they are immediately assigned to the miner that "won" them.  
Now, there is such a thing as destroyed bitcoin.  That is, bitcoin that has been sent to the incorrect address during a transaction.  As long as a bitcoin address meets the standard, it's a real address and the bitcoin gets assigned to it, even if no one knows the private key.  Maybe in a hundred year's time we'll run across a previously unused address that received one of these bad transactions and will re-discover these lost bitcoin.

I've never tried using Bitcoin to increase my overall wealth, so I've never had more than about 0.5 BTC at a time.  Because of my relatively small worth, I just use a mobile wallet right now.  If I ever got above about 1 BTC, I'd transfer that into an off-block paper wallet for deposits only.  But for now, the mobile wallet suits me fine, and keeps my BTC handy for spending.
@_date: 2014-04-28 11:20:03
The problem is that running a full node has a cost in processing power, network bandwidth, and electricity.  With no monetary incentive to run a full node, and the escalating tax on personal resources from Bitcoin's requirements, the cost of that altruism may outweigh the benefit to the user.  It's just not a sustainable model. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:12:25
Actually, this isn't the only way to regulate Bitcoin, and I'm very wary of the attitude that Bitcoin "can't be regulated".  Of course it can be regulated by cutting off the ability to convert it to fiat currencies.  Fiat currencies will always have the advantage because local taxes will probably only ever be accepted in fiat currency.  At the end of the day, we will always have the need to convert Bitcoin to fiat to pay taxes, and with that requirement at play all any country really has to do is to choke the life out of the exchanges.  If they make using Bitcoin more expensive than fiat through taxation and by making the red-tape more trouble than its worth, governments could kill Bitcoin easily.  
The question then becomes, "What scenarios would lead them to do this?"  And I would say that any evidence of a major money-laundering enterprise would bring this level of regulation on to Bitcoin's head.  Money laundering is *clearly* the regulators biggest concern as evidenced by Supernintendo Lawsky.  We need to be self-policing the Bitcoin network to make sure this sort of thing never happens.  We're starting to see that with user-driven investigations into the other exchanges like Kraken and BTC-e.  Keep it up, guys!

The rumors of their incompetence have been revealed to be true as such:
1. They ignored a known issue in the bitcoin protocol called "transaction malleability" (reported in 2011 by the foundation, and easily managed with code workarounds) which exposed them to the risk of losing bitcoins through transactions manipulated before being confirmed.  They suspended trading to assess their exposure and damage.
2. When this was discovered they selfishly threw Bitcoin under the bus by blaming the protocol instead of their own incompetence.  
3.  A memo was then leaked that indicated Mt.Gox was in serious insolvency mentioning that they had lost over 744,000 BTC.  
4.  Most recently, they've filed for bankruptcy protections in Japan.  People have come to accept they've lost everything they had stored on Mt.Gox, and the mainstream media seems to be having a field day saying, "See?  Silly nerds, bits can't be money."
Basically, Mt.Gox has shown that they really did start out as a trading card company with code written over a weekend that quickly became a major financial entity processing millions of dollars with that code.  A very scary prospect indeed.  Caveat emptor.
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:07:50
Actually, I was mistaken.  The hash is applied to the *public* key, not the private key.  But since the public key is derived from the private key, this, in effect, limits the effective number of unique keys available.  Because of the hashing done to the public key, we lose the precision of 2^256 .  With regard to your calculation, I don't believe that the number of private keys that would pair with a single Bitcoin address is as high as  2^96 , but I'm still researching that.

Then you're a great candidate for running a Bitcoin full node because the demand from the Bitcoin software on your personal resources is still far below your perceived benefit.  I'm just saying that the decision for others may not be so black and white.  Me, for example.  The only functional system I have is a work computer which I cannot use for running Bitcoin all the time.  I have been tempted to buy a new system specifically for running Bitcoin, but I don't know yet if the benefits I get from Bitcoin will be enough to offset the cost of a new system.  For other people, their ISP's may cap their bandwidth after a certain amount, and they need to make the decision on whether they want to donate their own limited supply of bandwidth to the network for very little of physical return on that investment.  Everyone's situation is different, and you can't fault people for deciding against running full nodes if it goes against their own interests.

To be fair, the Internet doesn't have to go down for the kind of problem he's talking about.  What if Bitcoin's algorithm is broken?  It's not out of the question (*looking at YOU, RSA*), and that would *certainly* tank the Bitcoin economy.

Coinbase and BitPay are assuming the risk on behalf of the merchant, but in the end they are just as limited as everyone else if they are unable to find a buyer for that Bitcoin.  Smaller operations are fine because there are enough buyers for those amounts, but the number of transactions by Amazon could really tilt the Bitcoin market.  I honestly don't know what their daily sales amounts to.


There is always a cost to add Bitcoin as an option, because you need to chance your site code.  It may be a trivial change, but it may be enough to keep people from jumping on Bitcoin, or it may be one of the other reasons.

Lemmie try:
"Bitcoin is a solution to the problem, 'How can millions of different actors all agree on something at once?'  In the case of Bitcoin, the "something" is a record of events (transactions).  It does this by matching all the versions of "what happened" from the vast majority of faithful actors against the versions from the few trying to subvert the system.  Everyone gets a vote on the version of history, and the version with the most votes wins.  This system can be used for all kinds of purposes, but the inventor chose to use the system for a distributed ledger of value first, using the system to agree on the order and amounts of payment transactions.  The result was Bitcoin the currency, but the concept of this system of distributed agreement was released along with it.  Now we have a new currency, and so much more."

More nodes is only in everyone's interest if you believe everyone's goal is to make Bitcoin successful.  Making Bitcoin successful may not be the highest priority in everyone's own interest.  If the cost of making Bitcoin successful (through electricity, bandwidth, and diskspace) outweighs the benefit received to the individual by providing those resources to the network free of charge, then the success of Bitcoin is in jeopardy.

This is partially correct.  Not all numbers in the 2^256 range are on the mathematical curve used for finding a matching key to use as a public key.   After a number on the curve is found along with its matching pair, the ripemd160 hash is applied to the private key which yields a 160-bit number.

@_date: 2014-04-28 15:38:51
Ok, I clearly struck a nerve.  Yes, I'm a subscriber to I'm a user of Bitcoin, and I'm a believer in Bitcoin.  So, why wouldn't I raise attention to this potential vulnerability in Bitcoin?  One of Bitcoin's greatest strengths is the network it has, but that network is in danger of shrinking if people don't believe the cost to them in very real resources to run a node is outweighed by the benefit people currently get from using Bitcoin. 
My guess is that at the height of Bitcoin's price people were very enthusiastic about being part of a transformative technology with some real steam, and we saw record numbers of nodes participating in the network.  Now that Bitcoin has lost some of that steam, people's enthusiasm has been lost as well and we're seeing the result of that.  In order for Bitcoin to succeed, I believe there needs to be a direct incentive for people to continue participating in the experiment -- even if it's only a nominal one.  People's enthusiasm for Bitcoin is one of the only things that keeps them using Bitcoin in its current state, and getting mad at people for losing that enthusiasm is about as smart to screaming at the clouds for bringing rain.  
Why not take the time to explore ways of keeping the enthusiasm level up instead of expecting that the sheer ***virtue*** of Bitcoin should be enough to compensate people for their time and resources?  I feel like I now know why people gravitate toward @_date: 2014-03-03 15:43:47
Personally, I think it's an analysis of risk based on the amount of transaction your business handles.  For example, if Amazon decided to use Coinbase or BitPay to handle their transactions, Amazon could quickly overwhelm their capacity to handle that much volume.  Then Amazon might be left with some exposure to loss.  Clearly, they're not ready to assume that risk yet.  
Other businesses simply don't understand enough about Bitcoin to even want to put their foot in the water yet, or they don't feel like the demographics that use Bitcoin wouldn't be interested in their products.
Finally, there's still a *lot* of legal ambiguity around Bitcoin.  What are the tax implications?  What are the global market implications?  Can you accept Bitcoin from anywhere?  Until we have some solid legal decisions to stand on, I think a lot of people aren't going to have the motivation to dive in.

Yes, those sound pretty safe, but I find it hard to believe you can easily keep a 100 random character passphrase in your head.  If you're writing that passphrase down somewhere so you don't forget it, is that really a "brain" wallet?  Wouldn't you just be trading encryption of one key for another?

It seems like a lot to get through, doesn't it?  That's why most attackers wouldn't bother with all that.  Look for the attack vector of least resistance.  
2FA is great, but because people occasionally lose their tokens, there has to be a process in place to recover access to your account.  It's these safety measures that are often exploited.  In many cases, all they would probably need is access to your email account and use the normal "recover my password" process.  And many email services out there just have a few simple and predictable "security questions" to crack them wide open.  
I don't know first-hand how Blockchain's recovery process works, but there are probably ways to exploit it.  
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:05:39
Agreed.  It may not be feasible.  If it's not possible to ***raise*** the incentive to running a node, then perhaps it's possible to ***lower*** the cost of running one.  Perhaps the core software could include some bandwidth limitation settings to make it easier for people to throttle the performance and more directly affect how much of their bandwidth they want to donate (this would be for people who have no idea how to do this from their router or OS)?  Perhaps those settings could be designed so that when the screen-saver kicks on, the throttle is relaxed more?  Maybe we could find ways to lower the amount of disk space needed for a full-node?  What about creating something like half-nodes that carry up to 1 or 2 GB worth of blocks, but refer to full-nodes for the rest?  Just spit-balling ideas, but if we could ***lower*** the cost of running a full node, we'd be accomplishing something very similar to ***raising*** the incentive.

Heh...I hope they never ask that.  But if they do, here's what I'd say:  
Every actor (node) participating in the Bitcoin network keeps several versions of "what happened", and each one is trying to find the version that all the others will agree on.  To do this, they take each version they have combined with an arbitrary "fudge number" called a nonce and run a mathematical formula on it which gives them a number, called a hash.  By adjusting the nonce up or down they can create hashes of different values.  The rules of the network state that to find the correct version of "what happened", they have to find a hash made from a version of "what happened" with a nonce that is less than a defined value.  Once this solution is found, every other node checks to make sure they can produce the same number and if it does, voila!  A version of "what happened" is agreed upon by everyone!
But now we're several floors past where my pitch would have been effective.  Can anyone help me shorten it?

I'm not sure there is a way to explain SegWit like you were 5, but as I understand it, *among other changes*, SegWit allows signatures to be removed from transactions, making them smaller, and thereby allowing for more per block.  Please someone correct me if that's wrong.

Why would you celebrate this?  While it's certainly a milestone, it's a major disruption.  Bitcoin miners have to scramble to adjust to a much lower expected yield.  While this landmark has been known since the beginning, and people should have been planning for it, it still seems like a big drop to deal with.

It seems like you're only talking about Bitcoin as an investment.  There are users of Bitcoin out there that are actually using it for remittances and purchases.  I'm one of them.  I don't have a huge amount saved, but I purchase more BTC regularly.  I'm just mentioning that it's getting more and more difficult to use Bitcoin that way -- the way I used it when I first learned about it.  It's purpose has clearly changed from that...I just want to make sure whatever it's changing to is still highly valued by its users.

@_date: 2017-11-15 17:19:00
That's true.  But if people started to use them because they worked better than Bitcoin for what they use Bitcoin for, they might switch, right?  I mean, Litecoin could handle remittances right now better than Bitcoin (faster and with lower fees), and you could transfer the same amount.  As I see it, the only other major advantage Bitcoin has over Litecoin is acceptance by so many vendors, but that could quickly change.  Accepting Bitcoin was a big step for vendors, but switching from Bitcoin to Litecoin would be a trivial move, since most exchanges accept both now.

Good points, and thanks for answering seriously.  My only response would be, "what if LTC wasn't the only coin people switched to?"  If the congestion were to be split among some of the other solid alts like Monero, I think that could all be bad for Bitcoin.  But you're right in that with many of the bigger players investing in Bitcoin, they will now have incentive to keep people using it.  Maybe I'm overreacting, but I just don't want Bitcoin to lose out because we stopped allowing for the possibility of it losing its dominance.

 But, there are more than 1000 altcoins out there.  If people just started using ***something*** other than Bitcoin, Bitcoin would suffer the loss.

Why not Litecoin? It's got decent acceptance... Nothing like BTC, obviously, but it doesn't have the delays or fees right now. I'm just saying that it's possible people might push for a switch to something else if they have to wait too long for the usefulness of Bitcoin to return.

That's good to know, and I hope that remains the case.  Just a question for you, though:  What originally attracted you to Bitcoin?  For me, it was the ability to move value around quickly, for low fees, without the need for a bank.  I freely admit the role of Bitcoin seems to have changed to many other things -- store of value, database of record, smart contracts, etc.  It's evolving, and that's awesome.  I just hope that the Bitcoin user base can evolve along with it, and recognize some of its other capabilities.  Sometimes markets are dumb, though.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:47:48


I totally agree, and I was hoping not to focus on that, but I do have to admit it's part of the whole equation.  I share your attitude toward the traditional financial system, and for the vision of Bitcoin.  Just don't let the attackers catch you unawares.  Stay frosty, my friend.

[I thought they were still testing it](  If they were ready to launch something now, I believe it would probably find itself in a niche just like Bitcoin or Apple Pay until people figured out how it works and how to use it.  
However, I'm not sure how they would monetize it other than with transfer fees, in which case Bitcoin would still probably be the clear winner.  Citibank might do Bitcoin the biggest favor in the world by getting people used to using cryptocurrencies with their Citicoin and then switching to Bitcoin when they realize it's cheaper.

I find this fascinating.  Is the idea with these physical currency bitcoin options (like these cards, or the coins available elsewhere) to use this currency without the transactions never even being digitally logged in the block chain?  Sorry if this is a stupid question, but I still can't quite wrap my head around this.  Wouldn't the addresses containing these bitcoin values still require a passphrase to access?
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:56:26
That's partially why I was thinking about it.  I was trying to see if there would be a way to include some more familiar financial services to make using bitcoin seem more familiar.  Perhaps *because* it's not familiar is leading to its use by the current user base.   Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:23:13
Agreed.  I just recently found LTB, and have learned a lot more about Bitcoin's capabilities far beyond just the currency.  For me it's amazing how the Bitcoin protocol and blockchain could be leveraged for many more types of official documentation like patents, copyrights, birth certificates, DNS, etc.  It really is a revolutionary way to think about how society could manage its collectively owned information.

One of the functions of a notary is to simply certify ownership/existence of a document at a specific time and place.  Bitcoin could easily handle that if you send a hash of the document along with a bogus or low-value transaction.  It becomes part of the blockchain permanently.  There are *several* projects already offering this kind of service.

While there's clearly an argument to be made that this gives Bitcoin an air of legitimacy for the uninitiated, I'm going to argue that adding a gateway to participation for the Bitcoin market just gives New York a shiny new handle with which to exert leverage and influence on something they have *no need to be a part of* today.  It's leverage like that which brings lobbyists out of the woodwork and adds to corruption.

What is the purpose of a witness?  To prove that something happened at a specific time and place. Evidence can also be used to prove something happened at a specific time and place.  
For example, if there is a car accident, a witness may be able to tell you exactly what time that car accident occurred, but you may also be able to find out what time that car accident occurred by checking the time stamp on the camera pointed at that intersection.  
Both the time stamp on the camera footage and the eye witness can serve as proof in a court of law for the time of the accident, so what is the difference?  In fact, given the accuracy of some testimony, I would almost say that evidence can be stronger statement of proof.

This video actually brings up a very interesting point that I think is being missed.  The point isn't necessarily about participating in Bitcoin as an average user.  The point is that if you're a full node on the Bitcoin network, you have to be able to handle all the tasks of a full node, and that means carrying a full copy of the blockchain.  In time, to accomplish that, we are going to need some pretty substantial hardware, and ***that dedicated infrastructure*** might be Bitcoin's Achilles heel.  Right now, even the biggest and busiest nodes can pretty much stay below the radar, but eventually, these super nodes are going to require their own dedicated space which would make them vulnerable.  
I think the solution to this would be to focus on figuring out how to distribute the capabilities of a single node across multiple machines.  ***That*** would solve the scalability problem, I think.  Than no one machine would have to be greater than the others.

I'm not talking about the currency aspect of it.  I'm talking about the other applications for the Bitcoin protocol and network.

I'd be willing to bet a lot of the people who bought in during this most recent uptick never had any appreciation for the underlying technological marvel of bitcoin, and just wanted to be in on the ride.  Some may have bought in specifically to artificially pump up the value for a quick buck.  It doesn't really matter to me.  The end result has just been more publicity for bitcoin.  What the pump-and-dumpers don't understand is that bitcoin isn't something that will just die after it's been left for dead.  The underlying principles are sound and have a pretty big disruptive factor for traditional banking practices.  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.

The value of the dollar and other fiat currencies are similarly speculative.  You may have a greater level of confidence over fiat currencies that their respective governments will honor and protect their worth through manipulation of interest rates and the rate of new dollar production, but if enough people begin to believe that control is no longer working effectively, or that the government responsible for that control is no longer making sound decisions, the true value of that currency would be quickly tested.  I'm not saying bitcoin is immune to such things.  On the contrary, its problems are significant, but they are different.  Trust in the value of bitcoin means trust in something other than governments which are ultimately run by people -- people that are subject to the same temptations we all are when given authority over something we all hold as valuable.  Trust in bitcoin is, in a sense, trust in something ***much*** more tangible than governments, banks, or precious metals -- math.  It may appear to be insanity on the face of it, but only because we've had nothing else to trust but men in positions of authority until now.

I don't see why I would have to use non-bitcoin as a medium of exchange.  For example, if I wanted to put a down payment of $3000 on a car and I had an account with a bitcoin bank which held a bitcoin balance for me of 4000 bitcoins, I could swipe a bank-issued debit card that would instruct the bank to pay the car dealer 3000 bitcoins.  It wouldn't have to be specifically *my* 3000 bitcoins that paid the dealer, just *any* 3000 bitcoins from the bank's Vault Wallet which I contributed to when I opened my account.  It's the same thing as transferring dollars around in the form of electronic transfers.  The only time the addresses would play a part is during transactions where the currency changes hands (i.e., when a depositor opens an account, or when the bank pays a creditor on my behalf).  Why wouldn't this work?
