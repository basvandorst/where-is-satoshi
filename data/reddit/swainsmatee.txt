Bought 1480ish at like 1255 then bought 600 today at about 100 less to try to zero dollar cost average or whatever. Or at least help.
With I bought more then just 1.xx BTC when it was at 840 last month.

Cash is fdic insured Bitcoin is "insured" in a different way. but only God knows how that would go if the gov shut them down and the money isn't there.
But 2 factor auth is MUST I use authy. Chrome plugin and easy to recover all tokens of you loose the app as long as you have access to the phone number. 
Paper wallets bro. It didn't matter if I'm in jail or in a deep water well with no Lassie around my money still gonna be on that paper (or rather corresponding keys) 5 10 20 years out assuming it still exists.
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:57:02
That doesn't restore all your accounts does it? Maybe on authy but google authenticator has no password password or backup password afaik
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:59:00
Never too late to get in. All I know is I probably soent around 500 this year for fun and if I cash out now I'm over 3k in the green
@_date: 2017-01-06 21:50:26
Use authy in the future. 
Chances are you're going to have to contact these companies individually and verify your identity and I found it can be extremely difficult if you have any balance whatsoever in the account. Because the whole point of two-factor authentication is security. With all the it doesn't matter if you lose your phone. There's a Chrome app comma you can recover your account easy if you have the same telephone number or migrate up to 3 times a year if you don't have access to that number. I have no idea what to do for your two-factor Authentication for Google. I know on my email 2 Factor authentication I was given a string of words that I could use to recover my account but as far as I know there's no way to recover your whole Google Authenticator without the phone as that would kind of defeat the purpose.
But after enough back and forth coinbase finally believe me that I had no longer had access to the telephone and that I had not been using all day but Google Authenticator and I had to send them a lot of documentation and a lot of headaches to get access to an account with 0.00 Bitcoin. If you have a few thousand dollars they are really going to scrutinize it
I'll never use anything except authy because loose your device loose all access.
There's nothing you can do on the Google Authenticator and but when you originally sent these two Factor authentication zup they usually give you some kind of backdoor entrance like somebody said a string of words to write down or something of the sort that you can recover with them if need be. But if you get a new phone there is absolutely no way to add your old accounts to Google Authenticator without being able to access those accounts

Criptsy used to be great. You could put in buy orders just like you're buying stock I wish coinbase had that so you could just put an order in and automatically buy if Bitcoin drop that low
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:50:17
I don't understand how do you get the bch?.I moved my money out but I don't get it do they give you the rwuivalent amount of bch or what? In mycelium I see nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:06:37
You'd be feeling different if you made a few k off a few hundred.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:50:20
Dude no. Just no. It's a cryptocurrency. By will you can afford to lose you don't even Have the money to begin with much less money that you can afford to lose
@_date: 2017-08-12 11:12:29
Dude I made so many small buys in the past two years I couldn't of spent over 500 it's tempting to cash out because I feel like a price drop is impending.
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:58:00
Yeah I'm just going to hold it I would like to get my bch claim and cashed out but I'm pretty much at a loss trying to find out how reading different FAQ
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:45:38
I don't have a crystal ball man but I have followed Bitcoin from the beginning. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:02:11
well... last tiem i cashed out and kind of temporarily quit the game was when it dropped from 5k to just under 1900. but i missed that night time dip to buy back in. but at the time i saw it as a bubble and between the bitcoin cash money from the fork i was like fuck it ill tkae my winnings. im not a gambler
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:21:09
I used coinomi. Loaded my paper wallet which I cleared the BTC out of. And viola bch in my account. Then I use their built-in system to shape-shift into Bitcoin using the shapeshift.io service.
Seamless quick and easy and my transaction was quick.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:28:57
There's no guarantees in life you're crazy dude. I'm a true Bitcoin supporter but I would never tell somebody that they're guaranteed to profit off of this long-term. Donald Trump is president. At any moment coinbase reps could be taken out in handcuffs and what do you think that would do to the price of Bitcoin when they're probably the number one supplier in the world. 
If you put all your eggs in one basket it's just not good investing in any sense you need to spread it out even with the kryptos. Right now everybody's just buying in because they want a token Matt maybe going to be worth something and God only knows how long it's going to take to figure out a way to cash it out. Luckily I cast my Bitcoin cash or B TCH I was rewarded from the other split and got $700 coin but seriously it was a bitch and there was only one easy way to do it which was fucking hard there was two other ways which were almost impossible I gave up.
I do believe Bitcoin is the future though but if you buy in today I hope you are buying in and planning on holding long-term because you have a surprise coming after the split. Bitcoins all over Instagram now about how you can still get in and me a quick buck and everybody's signing up and buying some what do you think's going to happen. Everybody's going to dump it. I think just one and two months ago it started crashing from 5K and coinbase was doing their Shady "website is down" I finally cashed out at 4200 or so per Bitcoin at the time before I fell below 2000 with in like a day or two
But look where we are today! I don't want to be a naysayer because Bitcoin paid for like half of my business because hell my mom bought one 600 dollars then it crashed and she dollar cost averaged now 900 is like 15k if only she'd listen to me when it was cheaper

Bullshit lol i mean not as bad a nigerian scammer but still a shitty try 
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:51:19
Get them out and get them out quick that's all I got to say man seriously like today

Best, comment yet.
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:47:25
People who had their money with Bernie felt safe, they felt safe with mtgox. Only God knows. All I know is I keep my Bitcoin on paper and invest what I can afford to lose which I have not LOL.. have not lost that is
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:49:58
I think I started around$180 or so which I thought was crazy high. It always feels like it's crazy high but it never seems to stop going up. but there is this split coming and I know that it adds all over the place on how you could still get in on bitcoin invest here make money quick Etc and it's dangerous because those are the people that as soon as it starts to crash dump it all and run. We want long-term
@_date: 2017-11-06 12:50:34
200 or less on coinbase set fee

Can this be summed up in text? 
@_date: 2017-07-16 00:48:21
Yeah that'd be great we all want out Bitcoin to drop in value as quick as possible. You should be an investment specialist coming up with such creative ideas.

What's your favorite? Who do you feel runs the most honest business?
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:24:09
Seriously my girlfriend was texting me all worried and I told her look it's still up like $100 from last month. 
Nobody knows where it's going to be next month but when it crashed back in the day that was a totally different situation you can't compare even remotely close to this. Bitcoin has value and I'm confident it's not going to be $300 tomorrow LOL. I'm just posting everywhere trying to make people hold onto their Bitcoin but if you invested your life savings then sure cash out this very second. If you're investing money you can afford to lose and you're willing to Ride This Out long-term you may become rich
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:01:17
It's funny because it's unavailable accept if you sit there and try enough you can eventually do a buy or sell I'm usually using a phone a computer and then another phone with the website instead of that app all at once
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:53:50
Fuck 200k...honestly it's not surprising. They can get away with anything it seems at least for now. Get a lawyer and quick. I was pissed about their fees not being 1.5 percent as advertised unless you buy $200 or more and it's annoying as hell
You email customer support, get an automated response, then a week later they email and ask if your still having that issue and THEN a human will reply like a week later.
For 200k they should be eating your butt out
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:40:50
Just used it the other day and same as always no probs
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:11:24
It hasn't it goes down whenever the price is fluctuating like crazy. I'm not sure how or what they're doing but basically it's like automatic. You just have to keep trying it's not really down because I use 3 devices at once and while two of them say it's down I finally push-up transaction through with one of them . Corn bases Shady they are criminal organization get your money out of there if you have any in there because any day now the workers are going to join mount gox
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:49:34
You could always try a test transaction using your keys and see if you can access your funds. But it sounds like your in good shape and probably rich now lol
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:02:19
Insert cash and provide the wallet address for the Bitcoin. 
Or to withdraw you initate a withdrawal and send to whatever address they provide and you'll either instantly get money or get a receipt that you can go scan once you have 2 or 3 confirmations then get your money.
@_date: 2017-06-27 17:45:42
Same here there's always a btc ATM within .5 to 1 miles from where I'm standing but there are more for buying then there are cashing out.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:43:29
Every time you receive BTC on a blockchain wallet you get a new private and public key unless you specifically have all your BTC sent to one single address since you started.
@_date: 2017-06-16 17:46:20
If your so unsure I would make a NEW paper wallet and move your funds there so you know they are safe. Then just add it as a watch/receive only address in whatever online wallet you want to use. I just print with an inkjet and gnerate the key while offline and I laminate it and then just watch my funds in mycelium. And if you ever wanna spend your gonna need that private key.
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:13:38
I used Bitcoin ATMs all the time there's honestly more near my house then normal ATMs
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:09:00
I'm pretty confident considering its worldwide and there's like 10 ATMs within a half-mile of my apartment. People are scared of the fork people are dumping who are looking to make a quick buck but I think we just have to stay in for the Long Haul. eth I have no idea I read an article which I'm sure was fluff but there's a board of directors and all their ICOs are down yet the price kept Rising. I really feel like it's a bunch of people just stuffing money in their pockets like the coinbase people. But Bitcoin itself is decentralized for the most part and I'm still a believer. I mean it's still up like at least $70 since last month period I don't know if it's this hard for or whatever the fuck it is calledperiod but anytime I sold low because it was tanking and I got scared I want to kick myself in the ass because a week later I could have been $700 richer (referring to my last sale of 4 eth.
I thought hey I'm sorry to see it tank and I had about $1,600 worth and by the time I finally was able to sell because I had to just keep trying and trying with multiple devices and computers I made the cell and still came out with $100 profit but three days later I could have been $700 richer if I had just had patience and confidence. Long-term I don't trusty eth. I'm a Btc guy. 
But who knows the stock market is Shady the cryptocurrency market is Shady I don't know which is worse to be honest but they're both easily manipulated if you have enough money and if you don't think there is hedge funds Trading these currencies in massive volumes and pumping and dumping and putting out fluffer articles and you got a surprise coming

From my past experience with PayPal it doesn't matter if you block it or even close your bank account you already authorized these ACH transactions and they will go through unless it's fraudulent
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:25:16
Good luck
@_date: 2017-06-27 18:05:48
For me it was after the silk road hack because it fucked my investment bad at the time. And then when silk road was taken down with 40million USD (in BTC) in their escrow wallet and mtgox went down.
We are good.

@_date: 2017-06-26 20:21:04
Dude it fluctuates a few hundred in a few hours sometimes have faith.
All the get rich quick people are selling at a loss. I'm hoping you invested money you can afford to lose but just tough it out man. All I know is that I can walk a half-mile and pretty much any direction and find a Bitcoin ATM where I live in the u.s. And yeah you might have bought in high but there's no reason to think that you're fucked for life. This is a tough time with lot of fluff articles coming out about the IRS and the fork aug 1st. 
Ride it out give it a week and then worry.
