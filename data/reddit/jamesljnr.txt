They just lost $70m, so yes, bitfinex do have some serious issues to fix.

When starting off you want to refrain from sticking on as many indicators as you can, the main mistake newbies make is putting on loads of indicators and not knowing what they mean/do. The majority of pro traders will only use 1 or maybe 2 indicators and mainly go off of price action. Personally, I use stoch rsi and occasionally rsi for finding divergences. 
Don't use high leverage to start off and don't expose lots of your capital starting off. Babypips has a great starting course and also this is great:
Let me know if you have any questions.

'Trading is for losers' Bro I'd still have the 3btc I started with in 2014 if I just hodld all this time, also did you miss the part where he took 3btc to 300btc?
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:04:42
I'm up in btc so I'm in profit. Your btc amount isn't going to increase by sitting on it. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:36:39


There absolutely is. TA is the easy part, it's risk management, keeping your emotions straight and sticking to your trading plan is what keeps your money yours. All you need to do is look at the bitmex leaderboards and you see. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:57:51
bit late
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:36:49
I'm just still trying to get my head around the fact that 50btc makes you a millionaire now
@_date: 2014-10-04 11:58:39
I really do feel sorry for you. 
How many bitcoins are you holding? I look at it like this, you've not lost anything until you sell. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 13:25:57
Ah right thanks for that, I'm using MultiBit, so should I encrypt my wallet then copy my .wallet onto a USB?
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:28:04
Your desktop wallet, eg MultiBit or whatever you prefer to use. 
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:32:43
Well that's not true if you know how to trade.
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:45:05
Shit, I didn't buy. I was trying to hold out before buying as long as possible, guess I left it too late. :(
@_date: 2017-02-07 12:42:32
lol okay. Tell that to the people who no longer have to work because of earnings through trading.
@_date: 2014-10-07 20:34:39
But is it really worth all that hassle for $3?
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:16:10
There's no true communist government left anymore imo. Even Cuba is now making changes towards capitalism now. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:29:29
CHEAP COINS EVERYONE!!!
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:14:51
Yes very authoritarian, but communist, far from it. 
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:15:54
They're starting to sound like President Trump.
@_date: 2017-03-22 14:17:45
lol don't panic, it's standard procedure.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:40:16
lmfaoo China ain't communist 
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:33:06
Yes, I'm sure eth investors were thrilled when their investment dropped to $8 from $19 within 24 hours.
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:33:59
I heard krakens pretty good never used them though.
@_date: 2016-06-29 12:34:36
A lot of people I'm assuming.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:24:31
BITCOIN IS DEAD!!!!!
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:27:12
[Would ya look at that! :P](
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:57:24
0.2 lol. I feel really shitty.
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:46:13
lmfao this cannot be serious
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:39:44
YESSS! FREE BITCOINS FOR EVERYONE! FINANCIAL FREEDOM WOO!!!
@_date: 2017-01-05 11:14:39
There doesn't have to be a reason, it's bitcoin. Chill out.
@_date: 2017-01-25 12:35:29
Personally I'd invest it. You can make mad money with leverage, it's entirely up to you though.
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:40:22
There's a huge backlog of unconfirmed transactions atm, just have to wait a few days I think. 
@_date: 2016-06-16 10:54:35
and GBP ;)
@_date: 2017-01-24 10:07:11
I don't know what everyone else expected. We're talking about the same guy who got arrested for insider trading.
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:52:51
 was at 71k a few hours ago so at least they're being worked through.
@_date: 2018-06-02 23:41:43
They are, but authority and state are not and until we fix the reason the state arises there will always be authority and oppressed peoples.
@_date: 2017-01-24 11:29:14
Nice of them to refund. Now don't do it again lmfao.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:01:10


Not necessarily. If I hodl'd since 2015 I'd still have 2btc to my name. The majority of alts pumped in May/June/July time. You just got your timing wrong. If I were you I'd carry on learning TA and look to buy some alts again once you're ready. Losses are some of the best lessons you can have.
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:09:35
Try 
bitcoinwisdom.com for basic charts
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:20:36
This is pretty much the same for the entirety of real life..
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:30:09
One lesson to take from this: risk management is key.
@_date: 2017-04-28 09:29:44
This is the worst advice I've ever seen. You're mixing investing and trading and giving mixed advice.
Investing = Putting your money into good projects which have real life value and solid fundamentals, these are coins you sit on and hold.
Trading = Reading charts religiously and trading the chart ONLY, fundamentals for the most part pretty much go out the window. Use fib/cloud/trend/rsi to find your entries and exit and always have a plan. You don't want to be stuck bagholding a shitty coin for months on end if you're trading.
@_date: 2017-04-19 11:05:45
I really recommend the Ledger Nano S, it's the size of a USB stick and looks like one too. Easily access your coins on numerous PC's without the worry of losing them.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:51:53
I wouldn't say so. DJI looks ripe for a correction but I doubt it has a correlation with btc price
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:15:28
I can guarantee that more than 1% of people who bought bitcoin have made money
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:29:10
Isn't that what happened last cycle though? 90% retrace did fuck a lot of people
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:27:06
@_date: 2018-04-12 14:51:24
It's been tested 9 times thus far, it's not arbitrary.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:26:24
lol what? TA is far superior for long term compared to short term.
@_date: 2018-04-10 19:41:10
Never used it in my life 
@_date: 2017-05-07 21:35:14
Too bad that you're a fuck head who doesn't even know the political stance of the person you're criticising. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:37:49
Passwords for exchanges, bitmex/poloniex ect.
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:50:50
I wouldn't say so yet. Think we need 8k to hold ideally
@_date: 2017-05-12 11:32:00
Fuck I have one of these. Using a nano ledger S but they still have access to passwords and such
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:24:17
No lol
@_date: 2017-07-11 20:54:36
Ledger has multiple accounts 
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:30:33
Yeah we did, 2.2 failed and we're off down the hill lol
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:59:24
You do not want to do this
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:44:38
So I'm assuming you got liquidated on the way to 3k then?
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:27:54
lol believe me I'm not a hodler, we shall see ;)
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:00:14
Most people use coinigy for charts, it's a paid service but they have 30 day free trials. Also bitcoinwisdom is free but with less functions than coinigy 
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:42:18
lol what much more is there to explain? Basically there's a lot of buy support around 2.2k and if we fall through that 1.8k is likely
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:34:43
So long as this 1hr closes above 2.2k we're sorted
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:51:30
That's why you don't buy at the highest peak man :(
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:46:05
don't use twitter but ya, learn some TA and you'll be able to find supports yourself ;)
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:46:55
It's going down
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:15:32
LMFAO are you serious? After you posted this the price increased $200 to $3k, if you opened a leveraged short at the time of this post you would've been margin called. Keep at the day job mate
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:09:41
On mobile atm and can't remember what my chart looks like but the more times the price rebounds off of a trend line the stronger it becomes. There's a significant trend line around somewhere 2.2k if I remember correctly. Look at fib levels and order book walls too
@_date: 2017-06-08 10:56:26
Keep going, a broken clock is right twice a day.
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:38:13
A lot of support around 2.2k, if it dips below that the next big support  is 1.8k. Plus I need it to close so I can go get my lunch lol
