No, the bcoin client is literally called [bcoin]( and is for Bitcoin while the bcash client is for Bitcoin Cash.  Please do your due diligence next time.  But thanks for the clarification on the trolling.

I don't understand the "troll" here, this person just seems to like [Purse's Bitcoin Cash fork of the bcoin client](

Apologies for the mistake, I forget about Segwit occasionally.


My mistake is no need for accusation of ulterior motives.  My point still stands that even with 4 million units there would be a hard cap at 500 tx (if my quick calculation is correct) of just signature data, limiting the system to 0.83 tx/s throughput.


I guess my point is that there's currently no such plan formalized, right?  I think it's bold to claim what signature scheme/action the community would want to take, but I see your point.

I don't think it needs to be available at reasonable cost to be a threat to the network.  It's all ready a danger the moment a state actor has access to such a device.

I would say BIPs are pretty formal proposals for such changes.  Are there BIPs for any of the plans?
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:24:41


I only mean "formal" in the sense of a well documented idea being proposed rather than a post you might find in a forum that lacks concrete details necessary for realization.  In this sense I think BIPs can be very formal, but this is just my opinion.


I don't think that's the case at all.  As a software engineer and member of the quantum computing academic community I think there should be realistic concern in the coming decades for the impact quantum computers will bring to crypto systems, let alone those that guard large wealth.
As such, to enable thorough testing of valid solutions and prevent any mistakes I only think it's safer to have measures in place for when the problem becomes real rather than being caught off guard and rushing to a solution.  But again, this is my opinion.

This is a total non-argument but I've said everything I want to about this.

This definitely depends on the physical system used for the qubit and the implementation of coupling mechanisms.  I wouldn't be so bold to make such a claim.  Of course these systems are still in infancy, but its not like it'll take 100 years to get to the point where these systems pose a threat to modern public/private key cryptosystems.

I don't agree with that but I don't have anything more to say.

Taken from the Wikipedia page on Lamport Signatures:


Unless there's a way to shrink this I don't see it being feasible with ~~1MB~~ 4MB blocks...

bq. They should know by now you can't divide by zero.
Sorry I don't think I understand, what do you mean by this?

What was the rationale behind using your chosen image?  You know that blockchains aren't some magical data structure that solve every problem, right?
