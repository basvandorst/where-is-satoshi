Bitgrail is essentially instant new accounts. 
Buy Bitcoin with fiat at Bitcoin ATM or Local Bitcoins &gt; Deposit to bitgrail &gt; start trading crypto &gt; wait for Binance verification &gt; move to Binance. 
You could be up and running tomorrow.

That's fine - but 80 years is a hilarious time frame to suggest. We're barely 20 years into the entirety of widespread internet use. Smartphones are 10 years old. The world changes fast. Making a prediction about technology adoption on an 80 year time scale is like saying "this will work in infinity billion years."

Thanks I’ll try this

I believe you. But what you are describing isn't a cryptocurrency. You are using the prime value proposition of a thing as an argument against itself. BTC has value because it's not at the whims of a board or stakeholders, not inspite of that. Before you take out URLS about fraud i think you should educate yourself more on the nature of cryptocurrency generally.

I figured it out : 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:37:33
Thanks I’ll see if that works

I've had great experiences with Breadwallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:37:31
lol wut this is from this dude's site.
"What IS here to stay?
Well anyone who watches the markets knows Ripple ( XRP ) will be around a long time and always be a stable bet and gradually climb up 5000%  by 2020 i think. Maybe higher by 2022 possibly 10000%  we will see, but i am sure it is a great stable bet, backed by many large banking instituitions worldwide for crossborder payments."

Everyone said same thing at 3k, 5k, Peter Schiff on MSNBC, Jamie Dymon, etc. Bitcoin was "mainstream" long before it's over 9 thousand. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:37:55
I tried it w both Segwit and legacy, no luck.
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:57:16
On breadwallet, then I sent those coins to ledger for cold storage. So the BTG is back at my breadwallet address still? How would I retrieve that?

This is the tutorial I used, came up 0 :/

Use binance. Got verified right away.

Dude you're on a cryptocurrency sub. About bitcoin. Decentralization and lack of "company backing" is a feature, not a bug.

Why would you pay the CC fee if the merchant accepts bitcoin and you pay in bitcoin? edit: oh, you're saying the merchant has already priced the goods to account for their fees. This is kind of a chicken egg argument. If the merchant wasn't forced to pay the CC fees, they wouldn't pass them on to you, etc.
@_date: 2018-03-10 18:18:48
It’s really great. Just finished.

Lol friend I’m not drinking coolaid. I’m saying the argument that the presence of a few hidden encrypted links in a massive decentralized open source network somehow negates the purpose of that technology is like saying we should shut down Wikipedia because of a porn link hidden in the metadata of some article’s photo. There are legitimate criticisms of bitcoin. This is hand wringing weak sauce fud.

Way to lock in those losses.

Not if the vendor wasn’t pricing cc in, because they were no longer using that system.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:09:13
No, my friend. Because in this scenario you haven’t lost anything. Gains or losses are not realized until you sell. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 22:46:28
No panic here. Cool like Kathy Bates.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:39:55
everyone here is right. you don't need an advisor. spend 6 hours this weekend googling about how wallets work and how to use exchanges, send a few small amounts back and forth as a test, then buy what you're willing to lose if the price falls. it's not complicated.
@_date: 2018-02-04 18:27:30
This guy gets it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:28:57
If you think bitcoin is either an investment or an expensive collectible, you really shouldn’t own any.
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:33:58
It’s possible to own crypto and simultaneously critique it, understand the criticisms, and refute the silly ones.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:35:16
The next 48 hours are critical.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:42:30
It’s not a sunk cost because it’s not a loss. Till you sell at a loss. 1 btc = 1 btc.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:57:25
If your factory where you manufacture widgets burns down, and insurance does not cover it, that is an irrecoverable sunk cost. If your asset fluctuates in value, that is not. This isn't complicated.

The Petro is in theory pegged to Venezuelan oil, fwiw. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:38:15

@_date: 2018-02-05 02:12:58
If they aren’t losses, yes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:06:53
“What if” is what is important here. What if it goes to 100k? The pair changes. The unit doesn’t. 1 btc = 1 btc.

i've been using bread. no problems so far. good interface good reviews. also have trezor. either way don't keep in coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-05 02:10:49
“In economics and business decision-making, a sunk cost is a cost that has already been incurred and cannot be recovered” this is quite literally not what I explained. The losses are potentially recovered. But they are not, if you sell.
@_date: 2018-07-24 10:50:42
Kinda defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2019-09-19 23:34:16
So invest more?
