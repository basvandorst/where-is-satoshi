True, but on the other hand, I would never keep my life savings on a piece of paper somewhere. I like the idea of keeping an HD seed in the cloud, and never having to worry about securing little scraps of paper. 
Actually, come to think of it, I would be willing to carry _access_ to my life savings around with me, provided that nobody else could access it.

Actually not even. I was storing it as an archived note in google keep. I figured, given all the other barriers (2FA, a difficult passphrase, locked phone), a non-descript file with a bunch of words isn't going to jump out at anyone unless they know exactly what they're looking for.
But I went ahead and encrypted it and moved it to another spot just to be safe. Really, I'm most worried about Google abruptly closing my account for some reason. That would be awful.

Thanks for the input. I hadn't thought of that. AFAIK, google encrypts everything within an account, but I'm not sure. That would be an easy extra layer of security for sure.
Thanks. I agree with your advice. I've done what you recommend, except for encrypting the file itself. Good idea.

The advantage, in my mind, is this: if something were to happen to my phone/laptop, or if I had to leave home quickly for some reason, I would be able to access the seed from anywhere and have full control of my btc. 
That said, I will probably move the majority of my hodlings out of mycelium, because, as you say, there's no particularly good reason to walk around with so much.

Yikes. That would be bad. Good point.
