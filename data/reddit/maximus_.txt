No he's not.  He fled France after he was wanted for committing fraud back in 06, he constantly fucks over the btc community in favour of himself, the guys is a complete jerk.

That's great news! Also LOL at the BTC fanboys downvoting this.

This site is utter cancer.  Stay away at all costs.  Also avoid clickbait, put this article in pastebin text next time.

To anyone who upvoted that you're a fucking retard, and if you did buy over $1k and sell at $550 you may as well have lopped your head off.

Breadwallet was fine, they said initially they wouldn't support a hard fork and so they wouldn't give Bitcoin Cash. In the end they did.

Well by definition it is 'breaking news'.  Also, this is not from a 'troll box kid'. 
 I am not a holder in any cryto currency but BTC holders are so obvious on this subreddit, because whenever an alt coin is announced they go into sub nerd hyperventilating mode and shout and scream that its all a troll - its embarrassing tbh.  
Any sane economist can understand that competition is a good thing, its clear that when you write stuff like this you only care about maintaining BTCs price by trying to bludgeon any advancement in alt coins at any given opportunity.

Peercoin and Litecoin are undoubtedly the best alternatives, this has been discussed to death.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:25:00
I think the recent price increase was started from the Oslo article.  Since then, interest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies has skyrocketed.  However, everyone seems to be investing with the view to hold and watch the price increase...but that only leads to one thing - a big messy crash.
@_date: 2013-11-09 02:31:15
Awesome, thanks!!

Sorry to be a pain, but what do you normally give tips for?  Poor college student here, who wants more BTC but can't afford them.  Cheers.

Yeh I signed up for the tip thing, its a great idea! Nothing yet though.  The ways I have found out so far to earn BTC is
-filling out captcha bitcoin
-bitcoin for surveys/watching videos
-get lucky on btc lotteries
But I have tried all of these and the payouts are so so low.  Here is the a list (

'Although the Federal Reserve generally monitors developments in virtual currencies and other payments system innovations, it does not necessarily have authority to directly supervise or regulate these innovations or the entities that provide them to the market. In general, the Federal Reserve would only have authority to regulate a virtual currency product if it is issued by, or cleared or settled through, a banking organization that we supervise.

[No, competition is good is in no way a circular argument, how on earth can you think/believe that?](
In the same way the public totally ignored, and was totally confused by bitcoin back in 2009/10, and still are mostly now?  Just because something is hard to understand, doesn't mean it isn't good/can't be adopted.  Tell me, how does a laser or crytography work????  If, I DONT UNDERSTAND IT THEREFORE ITS BAD is what weeds morons out of the market then thats good.  The strong survive.  Over time, more will understand, but hampering development because some humans are thick is the most retarded argument ever.
Thanks for linking that too, not only does it prove that you have to refer to ad hominem, but that competition is a good thing! Oh look, competition was created, and now the the worse currencies (FTC) is being ignored in favour of better alternatives ones (LTC and PPC).  Thanks for proving my argument!

Potentially yes, but how would they go about doing that?  All I had to do was give them an address if I so wished.
@_date: 2013-11-12 11:18:54
1.  I fucking told them on bitcoinforum, they don't have a contact option on their site.  Where you got the info from that I never told them is unknown to me, you just totally made that up
2. Why do you think shows like the real hustle exist? To show people how they can so easily be scanned.
What are you even still doing itt?  Redditor for 2 months...colour me suprised.

inb4 This is relevant to bitcoin traders, holders, and anyone who is interested in cryptocurrency.  Although mtgox may not be no1, it is still widely respected and widely used, and is often the leader in BTC prices.  
So for those wondering and/or can't get to the image I sent them an email asking if there were plans to implement Litecoin, and this was their response:
    "Alex Support, Nov 07 08:08 (JST):
    Hello,
    Thank you for contacting us. Peercoin currently we don't have any plans. Initially we are planning to implement LTC but due to some difficulties it has been delayed. Our team is working hard on this. We will keep you updated once it is implemented.
    Best regards,
    Mt.Gox Team

This is also fantastic news for LTC holders! Hope I helped.
