Bullshit they aren't. I got in at under 250 and I've sold most of it since then 
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:09:31
If it hits 100k I'll be rich enough to smoke what you're smoking 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:26:48
It's not. It's dead and newer generation cryptos are the answer 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:07:12
I didn't check between 2015 and December 17
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:54:54
In 2013. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:26:33
The amount of people who seem to think individual investors can manipulate this are insane.
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:44:41
Oh so you're only stealing them in one way. That's cool. You really think this is valid reasoning?
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:44:31
I guess op needs to suck it up. Who cares if he has no control over his money? From a legal perspective he does so it's all okay. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:37:57
Oh well that's not nice 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:48:51
That's fucking hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:38:56
Well you obviously wouldn't tell anyone.
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:33:55
It sounds like you haven't done your research on the rest of the market. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:40:00
Oh wow that seems way more likely
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:35:38
Supply side coins, for one. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:32:16
Oh duh, I forgot about bankruptcy laws. I just figured insider trading laws don't apply. This would be the easiest fraud to get away with ever, though.
@_date: 2018-03-12 03:49:51
Dude dont tell me you actually fell for the whole "muh market cap" meme 
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:27:00
Yeah but if he would have ridden on top of the bear and shorted till it was tired he could have left with a sick bear pelt and no scratches. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:14:16
How do I type that?
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:15:39
@_date: 2018-03-14 04:04:44
I don't get it 
@_date: 2018-03-25 23:48:38
When did you invest? I don't think I've ever been red. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:02:01
I am not. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:33:03
I wish more people had that view 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:31:21
It still grows, even if you account for that. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 22:10:16
You don't think someone with a financial background with huge leverage over the whole market could figure out how to short Bitcoin, when some dumbass like me from the internet can? It's not hard 
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:57:51
Lol you followed for years and bought in "big time" during an obviously overbought pump? Okay, newfriend. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:23:05
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:48:15
Someone can't research. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:09:36
But more importantly, who has money for an 80 but not booze?
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:02:52
That's not true. A hedge is protection against risk from a different investment. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 21:08:10
Converting to Fiat is still part of a service. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:22:26
It's more like they lended their basket to a company, and the company brought it back later with some gold in it. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 16:12:52
Illegal how?
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:07:06
So he typod a guy's name? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:19:55
Lol stfu you ignorant slut 
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:51:02
I wouldn't even be mad. Blow is great for trading sometimes. I bet it could help coders too.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:18:29
Bitcoin doesn't have any partnerships with companies looking to implement blockchain in this manner. It's also much slower than the coins being used and doesn't interact with security hardware. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 01:27:51
Market cap is a fuckin meme anyways. Who cares?
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:28:02
Or you could just short like a normal person. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 22:25:05
I don't see how we could know that wasn't an honest mistake since the terminology doesn't even add up
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:03:27
Similar to the Bill Hicks stand up about LSD
@_date: 2018-03-17 21:56:05
I'm not sure if youre joking but I meant coins being used in supply side logistics to cut costs. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:36:32
Mmmm love me some Lucy. That's what got me into Bitcoin in the first place. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:19:54
No one can predict this wild beast and maybe you've bought the dip. But I've held bitcoin for years and I'm currently shorting fwiw
@_date: 2018-03-19 03:01:11
Boomer virgin vs Chad margin trader 
@_date: 2018-03-26 04:50:55
Oooh I totally forgot about that run. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:17:58
Nah because they've missed chances to increase their stack. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:34:06
Completely agreed. At least to 5,500 if I'm being conservative. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:08:28
tfw you get liquidated at 9k
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:17:39
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:07:00
Yeah, that would be quite a funny joke. /s
@_date: 2018-03-14 17:21:59
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:31:10
Nice. You seem like a swell guy. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:10:40
NSA get this one!
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:03:40
Do you have time to talk about our Lord and savior MU?
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:54:05
Yeah because at a price of 9K we're all suddenly broke
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:15:21
You need to desalinate 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:53:20
Jim Breyer's also into it and he's been bullish on crypto
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:14:16
Lol get fucked IRS
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:02:42
Altcoins could never fufill me like Bitcoin does. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 18:33:41
And it's likely going way lower. That was an important resistance point that it got denied at. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:01:04
Oh shit central Asia bout to take us to the moon
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:11:45
Aaaaaand it's gone 
@_date: 2018-03-22 08:21:45
The greatest trick the CIA ever pulled was convincing normies bitcoin was a meme
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:15:46
I always feel like a bit of a dick when I short the hell out of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:57:27
You gotta pump those numbers up. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 22:35:21
And those centralized coins answer the question I responded to. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:10:17
Same 
@_date: 2018-03-17 18:05:58
Oh man you have no idea 
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:07:39
Why would she want an in depth discussion for a minute long joke bit? 
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:16:44
Well that's simply not true. You can win by trading. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:34:04
It's all I use and I've loved it so far 
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:43:39
I have an econ degree and I still don't fucking get this 
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:55:02
Can I ask how long you've been in the market? Comments like this would have never been popular before. I can't tell if setiment is changing ebcause people are changing their kinds or because new people are coming in with views differing from the status quo.  
  
I can't believe how many here want regulation. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:41:36
It's more about her telling friends imo
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:12:39
I wish I invented Bitcoin. My life would he so much different. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:40:21
Oh I knew at one point. And then I decided classes were easy for me and I'd rather do drugs and party all day. I've forgotten 90% of my studies. So yes, undergrad lol. I'm holding off on the Masters for a year or two to see how this crypto thing pans out. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:30:57
Life isn't a zero sum game. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:14:13
Yes please.
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:30:11
This mindset is why many will miss out on numerous Blockchain use cases. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:25:49
Can us arthritic early 20's folks join?
@_date: 2018-03-19 04:14:16
Well yeah. But those gains tho. Might as well hit up Vanguard if you want to play it safe. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 13:33:54
Have you read the whitepaper?
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:16:26
Oh I knew it at one point. But I replaced a lot of that knowledge with LSD and weed. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:00:48
Oh god dude your timing is not good. I hope you're playing around
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:55:33
I don't follow. To me, this seems as simple as 1) sending your btc to an exchange 2) short bitcoin 3) close your position 4) buy monero with the gains. Where does that go wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:54:23
You misunderstood. If it goes well I'm not getting a master's. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:17:13
I just shorted pretty hard last night around 9k. Anyone else not liking the short term price prospects?
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:48:23
Show him the 600 million recall of acura airbags that affected 15 million people 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:10:00
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:52:28
You're aware that's completely false, right?
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:41:01
He would be able to. He tried to do it in front of a small group with a smaller, supposedly related wallet or something stupid like that. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:25:29
How would my comment make literally any sense in regards to a public figure prominent in the media?
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:03:16
Dominance of only 75%? Nice FUD
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:59:08
I'm sure a lot of people would. But I wouldn't. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 08:26:09
That's not a question?
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:11:46
God no. Thats like the opposite of a Lambo. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:48:32
That's so boring 
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:48:20
Doesn't holding imply not selling instead of not spending?
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:50:05
Hows that 8k cake?
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:44:14
He hasn't publicly done anything. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 20:55:16
That was the bottom of a big dip for me. Bitcoin you crazy 
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:03:16
I drive an extremely nice sports car and couldn't give that up for a sedan or SUV. I'm sure I'll DD an electric car one day but I couldn't for my weekender. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 07:26:34
He shittily faked doing that one time. I think some of it's on his wiki
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:23:29
Idk about a transfer but you can buy them with cash locally
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:23:14
That's exactly how they work. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 01:07:41
Some of us bought sports cars and cocaine during the peak. Nothing wrong with taking profits for entertainment. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:26:10
That's what I was figured so I was wondering why they think this is the floor. 
@_date: 2018-04-09 03:59:02
Fuck,  I got my threads confused and thought they were talking about satoshi. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 06:11:47
Oh, nah. People are just jumping on the hate bandwagon there. For 95% of people they make a great product. I'm just one of those weird people who wants a 6.2L V8 more than they want mileage, interior space, or a comfortable ride. I feel like most lambo fans are in this category. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 17:51:11
But why? They're so boring! I'd take a Tesla over a Honda 
@_date: 2018-04-09 04:24:40
No worries! Thanks for the link. I'd been confused about that comment chain
