TL:DR They don't like bitcoin and criticize the fuck out of it.
EDIT, it's from 21 november 2013

I hope the price of bitcoin on their atms aren't gonna be 15% higher than the real price like in the bitcoin embassy in montreal.

To buy bitcoin in Canada I need to pay atleast 10% more because quickbt only accepts interac online. Local atms,vaultofsatoshi and cavirtex prices are always 10% higher than current price and localbitcoins too. It makes me hesitant giving 10% of my cake to some middleman.

What about Canada?

Still I can't buy bitcoin without a 10% fee at least in my city here in Canada. there is no point in buying with bitcoin if these shitty atms keep saying they dont have fees but their bitcoin price is 15% over the one at bitstamp.

Does this mean that shops will need to update their software? Good luck on doing that.

I don't understand this whole classic vs core thing .. 
@_date: 2016-02-08 23:05:47
It if it is happening already it's because there is an issue, simply ignoring is the worst you can do.

What about running something like bitcoin classic instead of bitcoin core? What is the difference?
