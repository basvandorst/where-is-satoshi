These people generally don't want to hold the bitcoin at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:22:14
According to their CTO, it's your fault. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:26:13
Well it's not the company that's offering it. It's the same as buying and selling.
When you're making a "bet" that it's gonna go up, someone else has to take that "bet" thinking it's gonna go down.
The company get a commission and just facilitates the trade. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:33:36
So you're over 18?
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:57:59
You're backwards. 
Basically you're saying "I give you $10,000 now and in 6 months you give me 1 Bitcoin."
You're betting that the price is going to be more than $10,000 in the future. If it is, you "win" becuase you bought something worth over 10K for only 10K.
The person on the other end is betting that its going to be worth less. If the price drops, you just bought a $8,000 Bitcoin for $10,000, thus "Losing" $2,000.

I did GDAX to my wallet and back with lowest fees in maybe 2 hours. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:18:31
With a Ledger wallet?

Or the real reason is a defendant receives life for one charge, life for another charge and 40 years for a different charge. And if the defendant gets one charge appealed, they are still in jail.

Probably typod password too!
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:08:12
Thanks for the tip! I'm currently doing a brute force using the character and length which I imagine I would be.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:30:08
I have contacted but I understand he is a very busy many. I've been using a Brute Force software on my home computer and can get about 550 guesses a second with it. Hopefully I can narrow it down a little. If the password is the longest I think it would be, would take 7 quadrillion years just randomly guessing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:11:32
I wanted something long and secure, so I picked something new. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:27:27
It sucks. And we only have ourselves to blame.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:43:03
Thanks! But I already did. Have an email with my electrum key but not bitcoin core
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:27:25
Okay. Any other tips? I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:25:43
Bank wires still take a day or two. Credit cards are instant but have high fees
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:30:32
Okay. Well that's good to know. Maybe I'm just not remembering correctly. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:09:32
No fees when transferring from the Node
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:43:03
Naw. When I kiss I like to give the lip a little nibble. I may be able to see it. The best way it to just write it on a piece of gum and swallow it. Repeat in seven years.
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:07:41
You're gonna pay a fee for using your credit card on coin base. But you won't be incurring interest immediately like if you did a balance transfer.
You need to do the math. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:32:18
I don't want anyone's coins. I had my own and lost my own. This is just to raise awareness so it doesn't happen to anyone else. So someone who needs the coins more than I do, doesn't lose theirs. I made my bed, now I must sleep in it
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:11:08
Yes. The buys are instant. You just don't have access to the coins until they receive the payment. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:09:47
In my experience, coin base is super slow with deposits. It normally takes 7 full days for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:41:38
Like Bitcoin, life is a roller coaster. If you want to ride, you're on it until the end. Every up and every down.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:39:22
Tattoo your insides. Keeps it secure and private.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:30:45
I've contacted him but haven't been able to start yet.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:56:20
Look, when your tipsy at the bar, and I come up and plant one on you and take all your coins, you're gonna regret it!
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:32:17
Always... Buy.... 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:37:43
Got it! This was the issue! 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:23:39
Sorry it's sideways. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:35:37
I set it up that way, but I'm still not showing up on bitnodes
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:44:59
I'm aware but thought it was good in there. Should I pull to a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:31:54
Which is my thinking. I don't know anywhere I can buy a sandwich with bitcoin, everyone is talking about it'll replace traditional currency, but then compare the price to the conditional currency. And even online site, it isn't "This is X BTC!" it's "This is $X and at current BTC prices makes it XBTC." It's an investment bubble, not a currency. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 00:37:51
Got it. Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:17:56
Okay. Well...Thanks for sharing i guess...
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:30:46
Use your Visa card to buy Bitcoin!*
*Has never worked for anyone, ever.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:13:52
Most you can have is 8 I think. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:46:12
Someone said to me "You idiot! People buy cars and house with bitcoin!"
Well, until I can personally walk into a store in my town and buy a sandwich, chips and a drink, I dont see that. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 19:39:47
Why is that? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:32:41
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:44:03
Where did you see that? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:41:47
Anything I need to know? Have some coin in GDAX  
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:32:54
I'm rich! 
@_date: 2017-09-07 19:34:25
I use You Need A Budget and update all of my accounts, including bitcoin, investment, and retirement, daily. 
Just want an easy way to check worth in USD
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:33:17
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:09:53
Do I get B2X if my BTC is in a wallet? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:30:03
You need to make a lucrative offer in order for someone to sell to you.
In simple terms. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:30:18
Always buy
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:59:10
Yup. I'm good. Already did that as well. Thanks!
