It's a toxic, undemocratic place leaking censorship everywhere.

I don't understand what your point is. How is it different other than *who* does it and the intensity?

Yes I do...?
Your point doesn't sound helpful. Censorship generally means preventing others from seeing one of your works, whether for good or bad.

Whoah whoah, you switched from "tell" to "dictate". I have the right to tell others what they should do and I don't have the right to dictate what they should do, though I may have the ability to dictate.

Okay, I assumed you accidentally misused the word.
That being said, censorship is anyone hiding another's (or one's own) work from others in the name of inconvenience, preventing harm or offense and I modified my earlier post to include a fuller definition. I don't understand what you're trying to get at here by saying a non-government is unable to be complicit in censorship.

They could do that by intercepting a fuckton of the web's SSL traffic in the name of "attack protection"! Yay centraliziation!

Now you can give money to another shady organization!

It's not a good idea interfacing with fraud-prone, inflationary and centralized currencies.

Any traffic passing through Cloudflare can be read by Cloudflare, except for anything under their keyless SSL service. Aggregating so much of the web's traffic (especially since it's decrypted!) directly into the hands of one entity is the NSA's wet dream.
