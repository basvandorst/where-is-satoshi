I sold at $18,007 and was pretty sad when it hit $19,000+
Couldn't pass up 10 million in profit though.

Why the fuck would you never sell???  I acrued just shy of 800 bitcoins and was constantly selling finally liquidating at $18,007.  It was 8 figures.  How the fuck much money do you need?!   
Are you planning on holding until you have less than a lambo or what?!  Diversify you fool.   You must still have at least a million dollars in Bitcoin which means you could sell say 80% and still be worth a ton of money if e price shoots up to $100k.  In the meantime go buy yourself a house or two with what you have.

Or.... You could have sold your Bitcoin for a profit and bought something useful.
At a penny you would have lost an insane amount of money.

What if you had bought at $19,000?

Bitcoin is basically garbage at this point.  You're confusing the value of block chain technology with Bitcoin and trying to justify the money you have in Bitcoin by making up excuses.  I cashed out and made a fortune - which was the entire point - and am not holding onto some fantasy of what bitcoin is.  Do you think my wife and kids care about Bitcoin and fiat currency?  Of course not!  They care about the fancy house and high quality of living.
Bitcoin is not a better vehicle to store value than land let alone the dollar.  Speculate on it if you wish but don't pretend it's not insanely volatile and unstable and a huge risk.
This always happens.  From silver in the 70s to the housing bubble and dot com bust and now Bitcoin you don't want to be the last one holding the bag.

How is Bitcoin going to a penny worth more than fiat currency?  I can assure you that penny Bitcoin won't help you raise your kids buy a house, car, education, or retirement.  You know, the things that actually matter?

Yeah and you can roam the flat earth from corner to corner without any vaccines ranting about how we never landed on the mom.  I get it.

It never hit $20k

Uh huh.  Sure.   If you didn't make your money by now it's just a huge gamble.  You have at least almost a 50% chance in Vegas.  It was one thing to put a grand or two into Bitcoin and pull out millions but those days are over.  You don't want to be the last man holding Bitcoin.
