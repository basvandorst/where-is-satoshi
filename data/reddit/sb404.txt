So glad they stopped using normal currency, they were giving it a bad name. Was the point that it will be harder to catch them? Because I know we were doing so well already =(

So... since they bought it with BTCs instead of money it's different how? Instead of buying the BTCs they would have gotten the house for free? Pretty sure if they use their retirement savings and they get a house out of it, the savings are gone.
