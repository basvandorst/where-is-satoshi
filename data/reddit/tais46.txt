1. our engine is checking the account balance before withdrawing. with this issues we had, the orders are not succeeded completely. But the users has seen it in their accounts.
2. tonight we are working on a withdrawing page. I hope that I can publish it tomorrow in the day.
3. dollars and bitcoins withdrawals will be allowed asap, before EUR withdrawing, because only the EUR bank account is closed, not the USD, GBP and PLN.
There you can also see, that I (Simon Hausdorf) have no problems with the government.
It is only the bank account wich has problems! If I had problems, they should also close my private bank account and also the BTC24 Limited USD, GBP AND PLN Bank accounts on the same bank!
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:29:36
yes, thats me, I have no reason to hide my self.
it is not me, who must be "fucked", it is the government.
official statement in this evening or tomorrow!
we had no chance, to prevent this current situation.
They only pushed a button and the bank account was closed.
the biggest shit is also, that we know all this thing from the poland finance ministry, and not from the german. The german told us nothing. We try also, to get a compensation from the german government for all the things happen! And I am sure, we (BTC24 Limited, my lawyers and good friend from me) can get them and pay it as a "bonus, compensation" to the BTC24 Users.
@_date: 2013-04-15 11:55:40
objection is send to the PL government!
hope to get the bank account open this week.
but I am sure we can clear this. I can't say a date, sorry for that.

German to English:
die kriminalpolizei hat die kündigung des kontos der commerzbank gefordert. desweiteren hat sie um mithilfe in polen gebeten, da transaktionen von polen nach deutschland zur commerzbank gingen. die polen baten ihre hilfe an und haben das konto für 72 stunden gesperrt. später hat ein staatsanwalt in polen entschieden, das konto für MAXIMAL 3 monate zu sperren. gegen diese sperrung hat man 7 tage zeit einspruch ein zu legen. dieser ist erfolgt und wir warten auf eine antwort
the police forced the commerzbank to cancel the contract with simon, they also asked poland for help in this case and they decided to close the account for 72 hours, after this they decided to close it for maximum 3 months but you simon can raise objections within 7 days...

Little Update!
As some of you know, I had some problems with the German bank accounts in the past.
I have solved the problem with moving to Poland and we had also never problems with them.
Why does this all happen?
The "Deutsche Bank" in Germany had some phishing attacks / hacker and some funds where send to my bank account.
This attacks does not stop on the "Deutsche Bank", because it seems, that it is a very stupid bank!
So they closed my bank accounts in Germany and I got an invite from the German police, to tell them, what I am doing.
After that I had no problems but my Bank accounts where closed.
(this all happen in the start time of bitcoin-24)
In my opinion the problems where fixed. I moved to poland and make all business on the BZWBK.
The Germans are now fighting against me and the "Deutsche Bank" has still the same problems, that people are sending me money from stolen bank accounts!
THATS NOT MY PROBLEM! The only thing I can do now is to not accept payments from the "Deutsche Bank".
The Germans think now, that I am trying to get money with this methode.
So they look now, where I have money and try to close all bank accounts.
Why in Poland? The Germans think, I am a criminal guy and they will stop the crime.
They asked the poland for help and they closed my bank account in poland.
I have 7 days to make something against this, otherwise my bank account will be closed for the next 3 month!
I am very sure, that we can get back the bank account in the next time.
I will not give you a promise, but it is possible, that I will get back the bank account in the next week.
(sorry for my bad english)

ETA will be given tomorrow!
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:31:09
they are the reason, why your BTCs are not accessible at this moment.
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:08:25
Why would you don't trust an exchange without fees?
Bitcoin-24 is alive over a year.
If you are interested, how we earn money and finance the project:
* Same-Day Option - We withdraw your EUR on the same day you made the withdraw. We earn 1% and have a lot of this transactions / day
* Donations - If you take a look than you see, that there are a lot people donating
* Parcel DHL - About 40-50 EUR per Parcel fee. About 2 / week
Thats enough for pay the Server and IT stuff and all!
I build up BTC24 not or earning money!
I will support Bitcoin and this is my goal. To give the EU and a little bit of the rest a chance, to exchange they Bitcoin for free.
Hope thats enough for the first :)

danke, aber das weiss ich alles bereits selber.
die Anwälte sind genau so schon am arbeiten.
2 in Deutschland, einer in Polen, 2 Studenten (Jura) Polen, Anwalt von MT. GOX. das sollte erstmal reichen.
Aktuell scheint es nur um ein Problem zu gehen, welches nicht mal wirklich ein Problem ist. Ich darf, laut Aussage meines Anwalts, leider keine weiteren Informationen erstmal nennen.
Der WDR in Polen weiss bescheid und würde auch eine Pressemeldung veröffentlichen. Genau so wie die Internet Medien.
Das Problem liegt jedenfalls nicht auf meiner Seite und ich habe nichts falsch gemacht. Es scheint hier einige "missverständnisse" von den Deutschen zu geben, welche schnellst möglich geklärt werden müssen und anschließend müssen wir auf Schadensersatz verklagen.
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:47:37
hey, it is ok to go to the police or your own lawyer.
at this moment it would also help us, to make a collective suit to the banks and german government.
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:05:14
This Video is a joke ;) It was not possible and I also checked the user account on this date and the user also wrote me an email and PM over bitcointalk.
The double trades which happen before closing are rolled back and it was only about 1 hours that we had problems with it. Some trades where duplicated. the problem is solved.
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:52:45
1. 0
2. all double trades where reset.
3. I can't. If I give you a date, you insist on it. My lawyer told me the same
4. Ok, so I will not talk again about banks and when they open the bank account again.
5. I am not. My lawyer is saying the same. They have no right to close my bank account
6. I am trying it as you can see!
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:19:07
I think that the people who know me know, that I try everything to get the business up again! And I am not the "fucker" which drives now away with YOUR money and YOUR BTC!
The money and the BTC are not lost. We are still holding all the funds. The biggest problem is, that we can not access the bank account.
@_date: 2013-04-14 21:38:26
it is NO personal account! the commerzbank account is also a firm account. the commerzbank does not use the BTC24 Limited name for it, they used the "Simon Hausdorf" for it!
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:48:22
Right, and this earnings are now enough, to pay all the lawyers and flights to poland, within germany and do all, I must do to getting back to the old status and set the trading enginge online again and pay all users their money and bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:46:45
my lawyer is saying, which information i can give to you.
also that I can't publish a ETA when we are online again. But when I say, we are back on friday, and we are not back on friday, I have much more problems.
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:45:22
All money send to the BZWBK (Poland) bank account and which are still send to this account, can not be stopped.
The Bank account in Poland is noch closed, it is just blocked!
So all arriving payments will not send automatically back.
The Comerzbank (German bank account) is closed in 2 Month.
We are not able, to send funds anymore from this bank account, because we had a very low limit on this bank account and I can't get money out of it. My lawyer is in contact with the bank on monday.
First of all, we must find the reason for all this, what happen.
All we know is, that the German government asked for help from the Poland government, to close the Bank account in Poland. Some people are asking now: Why is not the Commerzbank still closed? The reason is, that it is not so easy in Germany to close an bank account within some minutes like it is in poland.
WHY does the German government closed our bank accounts and WHY do they give us no information, before they are doing this? WHY must we hear from the Polish government, what happening atm?
* 1 Lawyer, 1 from the Government and 2 students in Poland are helping us to get the Polish Bank account back. I am sure, that we will get the bank account back, maybe also this week! So we are able to do all payouts which are open.
* Asking the Commerzbank for more information, why they also closed our bank account, wich reason did they have to do this?
* Our lawyer is trying to get the Commerzbank account back, because there is no reason, to close our bank account.
* Setting up the trading engine again
More informations tomorrow, after my lawyer gives me a feedback if it is safe to publish that, what I am writing. It is not easy atm for me to give a statement, before it was double checked.
@_date: 2013-04-13 06:08:52
because the polish bank account was closed and I tried to do the business again over a German bank account.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:46:56
I am waiting for the "go" from my lawyer to know, what I can write in the official statement I will give all users with email and on reddit.
