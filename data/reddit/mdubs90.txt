Pretty sure they're separate, those backup codes are for printing off and accessing the actual gmail account when 2FA is turned on if you lose your phone. I never had those backup codes because I hadn't actived gmail 2FA...I just tried to use one of my codes to log into bitfinex anyway and it didn't work. The only way I see them getting my bitfinex secret key was if someone got into my phone, or if I saved the key somewhere when I linked it initially, but i'm 99% sure I didn't

Didn't have my 2FA codes saved anywhere...if I lost my phone I guess i'd email bitfinex to have it removed temporarily...trying to work out if they've emailed bfx to have it removed, but my 2FA still works so not sure how that'd be possible

It's my wife's email - both our money. Like I said, I don't normally leave it online, but I was in a trade at the time.

Thanks dude

Thanks for the info, do you think it's possible they emailed bitfinex to have 2FA switched off, then re-enabled it once the BTC was withdrawn? Or would that have generated a new secret key and stopped my 2FA codes from working? I've emailed bitfinex that question but can't get a reply
