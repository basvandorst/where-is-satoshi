Wow, I didn't realize this.  So when I pay to a given address, there are 2^96 possible keys that could claim the funds?
That asymmetry seems.... wrong.


@_date: 2016-08-27 19:16:03
It's pretty simple really.
1. Generate a bunch of keys/addresses in a secure location/environment.   thousands, millions, whatever you want. 
2. Copy the addresses only to your public server.  Put into database, flat-file, whatever.
3. Give an unused address to each customer.  mark it as used.  ( retrieve + mark should be an atomic operation, eg inside a single db transaction. )
4.  If you ever need new addresses, go to 1.
Alternatively, you could use an hd-wallet like so:
1. Generate an hd-wallet in a secure location/environment.  Use any hd-wallet software that allows exporting master xpub.
2. Copy master xpub to public server.
3. For each sale, derive a new address.   Here's a [tool]( I made for deriving addresses.  Others exist also.
One issue with generating addresses from hd-wallets is that some customers may not complete the sale.  This can leave you with many addresses in a row that never receive funds, thus leaving gaps of unused addresses.  Most hd-wallet software interprets a gap of 20 unused addresses to mean "end-of-wallet" and won't read past that.  So you may need to use a wallet or tool with configurable gap limit (such as the one I linked to above) to find all addresses with funds.

Here's a decentralized alternative to credit cards:
1. save money instead of spending it on random "consumer" crap you don't need.
2. pay off your credit card(s) if you have any, and cancel them.
3. don't borrow.  live within your means.
the end.
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:54:55
You give out a unique address for each sale.  So if an address is sent multiple payments, it is almost certainly the same party that sent both.   Or anyway, not your problem.  All you care about is, does the total amount received at this address equal (or exceed) the agreed sale price.
As for blockr API specifics, you are on your own.   (Though I could consult, for a fee).

oh, and to query for payments you could call a blockchain service API, or could run bitcoind in watch-only mode ( call [importaddress API]( for each address ) and use either [-walletnotify or -blocknotify]( according to your needs.

It seems to me that what is needed for remittance is not remittance middlemen, but rather more educational resources.  By this I mean websites targetted at each country/language with simple instructions "how to send money from country A to country B".
The instructions would typically be some variant of:
1. Obtain bitcoin by finding somebody on localbitcoins, or signup for coinbase.
2. Order a debit card for a member of your family.  eg Bitpay card.
3. Fund the card with the bitcoin you bought.
4. Your family member can now spend the funds locally in their country.
5. Buy more bitcoin and fund card monthly or as needed.
Of course, there would be plenty of hand-holding, graphics, video tutorial, debit-card comparison, etc.

Thanks for creating CryptoWoo.   My philosophy is aligned with yours.  Let's get rid of the middlemen.
I went looking for payment plugins for popular shopping carts a few months back with the idea that I might start a consulting biz to help merchants get setup to accept bitcoin directly.
I was quite disappointed to find that there were not any actively maintained free and open source solutions available that do not require a hot wallet.
To my mind, this is an area where the bitcoin development community has really fallen down, and is leading merchants again down the path of centralization for lack of quality free software options.
I would be curious what your adoption has been like with merchants.    Do you think there are enough merchants out there that want to do it themselves to make it worthwhile for someone like myself to setup shop, perhaps starting out by recommending and setting up CryptoWoo for businesses?

does energy "disappear" when you run an electric motor?   does it all just go to heat?    no, something moves, and "the rest" goes to heat.
same thing in a processor.  just you can't see the movement for yourself, and the device is so inefficient at moving electrons and lowering entropy that "the rest" may seem equal to input energy to the limits of our meters.

they did it because bech32 addresses use less space.   But I think it is a mistake not to also provide a backwards compatible address format also, for accepting funds from the vast installed base of bitcoin users, especially as segwit was marketed for ages as being backwards-compatible.

Couldn't some sort of consensus rule be created to enforce that miners must include waiting transactions in blocks?

@_date: 2017-12-16 01:56:18
nice writeup.  I wish samourai would work on older version of android thats on my phone.
also: electrum doesn't support p2sh segwit, only bech32.  This means you can't give segwit addresses to third parties for payment unless you know they also use a bech32 client+wallet.   On electrum desktop it is possible to create  a p2sh wallet via manual import of a bip39 mnemonic seed, but that option doesn't exist in the mobile wallet.  all in all, kind of an unfortunate situation for anyone that wants to use segwit in a backwards compatible way.

yes and no.  
**yes**:  [proofofexistence.com]( makes it super easy to store a digital fingerprint of a document in the blockchain.  With this, you can prove you had possession of it on X date.
**no**: It will not stop anyone from copying it, so will not protect your content in that sense. But it will be strong evidence for any plagiarism claims you make.
**important note**:   the fingerprint is specific to the EXACT document you upload.  This means that if you later change one character, it will no longer match.   So I would highly recommend that for each article you publish to your website, you:
1) make a copy of the article in either plaintext or PDF format.  ( separate from the HTML article )  Let's call this the registered copy (RC).
2) Store the RC on the website, linked to from your article.
3) Register the RC with proofofexistence.com.
4) Display the fingerprint next to the link to the RC.
With those steps in place, you will have solid evidence that anyone can easily check/verify.
To verify, just submit the RC to proofofexistence.com, and it will display the original date.
proofofexistence.com has an API, so the submission process can be automated.
I could implement the automation if you require assistance.  Contact me for rates.

recently there has been a long discussion on bitcointalk about this topic.  The poster posits that bitcoin is essentially a measuring stick (like a meter) that should never be changed, and its very existence will expose government fiat meddling and eventually force them to create fiat monies that asymptotically approach "ideal money", a stable form of value (not inflationary or deflationary) as proposed by John Nash, who spent decades of his life thinking, writing, and speaking about money, especially ideal money.
Thus, anything that changes bitcoin's "measuring stick" qualities, even a transactions-per-second increase, should be opposed as it arguably changes bitcoin's value proposition.
It is a unique view that many here may not initially agree with, but I think is at least worth being exposed to.   and it represents a third camp besides segwit and BU.  The camp of "no change".  
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:28:24
how, using centralized mixers or exchanges?  That requires trusting a third party with my coins.   thanks, but no thanks.
Or if you have a solution that does not require giving control of my bitcoins to another party, please do share.
I believe/hope zerocoin or equivalent truly anon coin will win out in the end anyway.   Most people don't want their transactions made public or easily tracked.  Thats one reason many people prefer to use cash over credit cards.
Anyway, these businesses can do as they like.  For my part, I don't think that online wallets or any services that offer to hold your coins for you or require one's identity are in the spirit of bitcoin and I choose not to use their services.

Please provide the xpub key you are using.  I can verify the bitwasp/bitcoin-php lib will derive it, or not.
I have written a CLI tool [hd-wallet-derive]( that derives addresses from xpub, ypub, zpub.  It is written in php and uses bitwasp/bitcoin-php under the hood.
If you are just looking for a utility that does the derivation, or a class for your php application, you might want to take a look at hd-wallet-derive.
I tested the xpub key that is in the linked guide, and it works fine.
    $ ./hd-wallet-derive.php --key=xpub661MyMwAqRbcGYcu6n1FmV1TbE8EwnSKecRZLvKAMyj4qLf15qXsoNryiKNvCkRq3z5kBCeZG8115jj28eVqmeKBJZPqjAfwRD3TGx1w5hY -g --numderive=2 --cols=address

     | 1GR4fg5XYjC1kszgN5mbN44WrjkADfD5s1 |

So if you are using the same xpub, then the problem must lie either in the guide you are following, or in your setup/config, or in not following the guide correctly.

Hey I agree with you that much more modularization is needed.
I do not agree that securing cold storage, a big part of the bitcoin ecosystem, is unrelated to bitcoin-core's mission.

@_date: 2016-06-27 18:48:31
a blocksize hard fork will not happen.
whatever a few core devs may have said is irrelevant.
The reason:  a hard-fork is controversial and bitcoin is all about consensus.   controversial changes do not get consensus.  by definition.
bitcoin is already too broadly adopted for consensus on this.  it is ossified.  you may as well try to fork ipv4.
segwit will provide temporary breathing room until higher level solutions such as lightning enable broader scaling.
repeat: a blocksize hard fork will never happen.
get used to it.  deal with it.  stop wasting mental energy on it.

I've already written an app that can generate an HD wallet offline. And there are various others.  But (a) that's not good enough, and (b) this is not for me.
No 3rd party app or wallet has earned as much trust as bitcoin-core.  I think also that no other app receives as much expert peer review or has reproducible builds.  Further, most 3rd party apps rely on yet further library dependencies that could potentially introduce malicious or buggy code.
If people use 3rd party apps with problems and have their BTC stolen, this is harmful for the individual and also the entire bitcoin ecosystem.
Cold storage is an important part of Bitcoin.  To me, bitcoin-core, as the reference implementation and most trusted btc software, should make the process easy, so that normal people can use it and have faith in their cold storage.

agree, 2000%.  actually, I've been saying the same thing publically for a while now, and privately longer.
In my view, the best way to innovate with cryptocurrencies is to either build a complete new codebase (ala monero, ethererum) or fork and create a new genesis block.
If the new technology offers genuine innovations, eg privacy in monero, then the market can shift to it over time.
But there is no reason to break the implicit contract of users on existing blockchain, eg: bitcoin.
I would like to see the industry move to a model where hard forks are ONLY done with a new genesis block, and users are simply encouraged to trade into the new blockchain, or risk getting left behind as the old one becomes gradually less popular.
I'm sure that thought would need to be put into it as to the best and fairest way to start the new blockchain or else prices might go crazy at the beginning.  But I feel that reasonable solutions could be found, maybe even starting with existing utxos from the older chain.
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:23:44
Let's envision an ideal cryptocurrency for a moment.  It seems to me that all participants would help enforce the network security (ie run full nodes and mine) and receive proportional compensation, and it would have maximum possible participation, ie distributed to all people and to all their connected computational devices.  Quite possibly (and hopefully) some of those devices would have the consensus rules embedded in hardware.  Achieving consensus for a rule change would be all but impossible in such a system, especially after the non-technical people have it running on their devices.
Given that bitcoin has just achieved consensus for segwit lockin is already prima-facie evidence that it is *far* from ideally distributed and decentralized.   The fact that segwit2x is even a thing on the table means it is quite possibly broken beyond repair.
but hey, time will tell.

re segwit, I am mostly in agreement with it on a technical level.
re tcp/ip, you make a good point that it changed in its early days.   But then again, tcp/ip in its early days did not have millions of people that had invested significant amounts of money (and some their life savings) into it under a particular set of rules.
my position is that the main value proposition of a cryptocurrency is that is NOT subject to arbitrary changes.  Because if it is, then it is little better than fiat.
So the sooner a cryptocurrency (any cryptocurrency) becomes widespread and entrenched enough that it can no longer by changed by any amount of "voting" or politicual persuasion, the better.
Another way to look at this:  the better distributed and decentralized a cryptocurrency is, the harder it will be to change.   Think if everyone on the planet were running their own full node.  That's a lot of cats to herd.  Even harder if there is hardware that implements the consensus rules.   So the corollary to this is that if consensus rules of a given cryptocurrency can be changed/adopted, then this is a strong indicator that the currency is not decentralized and distributed enough.  It is NOT resistant to manipulation (and fixing that should be a primary goal).   I think this point should be self-evident.

The consensus rules are a worldwide agreement of what bitcoin "is".
Any attempt to change those rules is an attack on the current system/agreement, by definition.
People may consider the attack "good" or "bad" depending on which properties they wish to see changed, or not changed.
Your desire to wish to scale the system does not make changes to that end (eg segwit) any less of an attack on the existing agreement.  It is simply an attack that you approve of.  
This is a dangerous position to take however, as in the future there may be other attacks (marketed as "upgrades") that you do not approve of.  I argue that it is better to say a resounding NO to all attacks and avoid precedents that can be used as justifications.
Further, for each successful attack, there may be unintended consequences and downsides to the change that can only be found in hindsight.
As to whether bitcoin could scale, or needs to scale with the status quo rules, that is a separate discussion.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:21:29
I oppose all consensus rule changes, at all times, unless made in conjunction with a new genesis block.

Typically when people talk about rogue type miner activities (theoretical or real-world), they mean miner's who run bitcoin code that has been modified.  This could be either a solo miner with lots of hashpower or the operator of a pool.
If you are using a pool, then you are trusting that the pool operator is using standard bitcoin software and not trying to do something you do not agree with.
This became an issue when there was soft-fork signalling for segwit, segwit2x, bch, etc.  The large pool operators were able to leverage the hashing power of others to signal for things that those performing the actual work (hashing) may not have supported.
To my mind, this is one of the biggest problems with mining pools, the concentration of power it enables for changes to consensus rules.
In a truly decentralized system with millions of solo miners, it would be very hard to get them all to upgrade to the latest software and signal they want some change.  This leads to a very stable system where consensus change is all but impossible, especially anything remotely controversial.   But when instead you have thousands of hashers using approx 10 large pools, those pools can make a controversial change happen.
@_date: 2017-01-31 00:18:43
yeah, I noticed that too.  now there are none in silicon valley.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:57:38


I think you mean price here.  The real long term value will be determined only in hindsight, years from now.
My argument is that the most real, long term value will come from the chain that finally proves itself immutable.  The one that proves over and over again that it will not changes its consensus rules.  period.  It might be a future "version" of bitcoin, or it might be something else.   Markets love predictability and stability.  Only a chain that stands firm to its ruleset can provide that.
Yes, others can hard-fork away from such a chain.  But so long as there is ONE that stands firm against change, it can be an anchor, against which all others are measured.    Presently, bitcoin is (was?) best positioned to do this,  but has just deviated from that path.

@_date: 2017-08-08 22:05:45
yes I can.  I'm still running the same software as ever, before 0.13.1.    bcash has not prevented that.
I think what you are actually trying to say is that my node can no longer transact with forked bcash nodes.  That is true.  however, my node also cannot transact *securely* with "soft" forked segwit nodes unless I somehow avoid (blacklist) utxos with a transaction chain that involve a segwit tx.  And status-quo nodes do no such blacklisting.

They glossed over that little tidbit in the "segwit is backwards compatible" brochure.
 
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:36:27

I found this statement at, ironically: 


I agree with the statement.
Unfortunately bip148ers and 141ers have forced their views on us.   We can still run old full nodes, but only with a much-weakened level of security level, due to the "anyone-can-spend" nature of soft-forks.
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:34:04
never any more successful attacks on the consensus rules, yes.
@_date: 2017-01-28 23:11:56
even soft forks can erode the implicit contract (code/rules) that was in place when people invested.
For me, the ideal coin would be one with an ethos that "it does not hard fork unless 99% agree it does".    Improvements can be made elsewhere, and if it is a real advancement, I would probably invest in that also.
In other words, let the market decide.   Eventually, a coin should emerge that has all the needed attributes, esp fungibility and scalability.  Until then, I think it is still very early days and anyone invested in bitcoin is by definition an early adopter and should be nimble enough to jump on a new blockchain if it is clearly superior.
The funny thing is, I think that my wish may come true simply from the very nature of bitcoin and it's community.  I do not see segwit getting adopted any time soon, and so people will start to face the reality that controversial forks do not happen. 
monero is currently seeing a lot of community growth exactly for this reason I think.    I'm not very fond of their "hard fork every 6 months" policy, but I don't think it can last very long either as that community grows.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:04:00
congratulations on a successful attack against the bitcoin consensus rules.
the fact that they can still be changed is clear evidence that bitcoin is not (yet?) widely enough distributed and decentralized to resist political attacks and manipulations.
I hope this will be the last such change and I urge anyone considering future changes to side with the status quo.
I will also mention that anyone who does not want the extra bandwidth usage that will be incurred by segwit can choose to run a full node version 0.13.0 or below, which do NOT include segwit support. That's what I intend to do, for forseeable future.
@_date: 2017-08-11 02:28:23
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:01:13
is it?     I can still run old software any time there is a fork on any blockchain.  so what?
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:41:56


uhh.... the pro segwit camp just changed the system to suit themselves, legitimately or not.


like the segwitter's just disenfranchised the status-quo camp.


except those who don't want it.  
I for one, continue to run full nodes prior to version 0.13.1 that do NOT run segwit code.   This means that my bandwidth and disk usage will not increase above 1Mb like the rest of y'all.
It also means that my node can no longer validate any transactions sent to me if said transaction has a segwit transaction anywhere in it's previous history (tx chain).   This little factoid was not mentioned anywhere in the "segwit is backwards compatible" brochure.


We shouldn't fork at all now, hard or soft.   All proposed consensus rule changes are attacks on the status quo consensus.  by definition.   segwit included.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:58:14
I can make an exception for critical security patches.   Usually they have 99% agreement anyway. 
Though in theory, one could envision a project that states:  "All consensus rule changes will take place in a new codebase, with new genesis block.  When that happens, it is up to token holders to voluntarily migrate to the new chain, or remain on old chain, at their option".   This is a market based, entirely opt-in approach to upgrades.
yes, Satoshi could have done it the way I am suggesting.  That would've set a better example for the entire cryptocurrency community.
@_date: 2017-01-28 22:21:46


Is it?  are you sure?
I would argue that bitcoin's value derives primarily from its immutability.  If it could be easily changed, why would anyone hold it?
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:25:14
a potential 4x increase is hardly "modest".   anyway, it's a problem for my nodes.  thus, I refuse to upgrade.
I suspect that real-world segwit adoption may not be as widespread as people here would like to think.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:29:06


Isn't the wisest path to avoid hard and soft forks altogether, and just let bitcoin be bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-09 16:40:04
yes it is my choice, and if that were the extent of it, I'd be glad.
Unfortunately, my full node with full history will not be able to validate any received transactions that have a segwit tx anywhere in their history chain.
This is because segwitters have changed the rules, leaving those who do not agree in a position where they have less security than previously.
This factoid was not mentioned in all the talk of "soft-forks are backwards compatible".

sounds like tyranny of the majority.   also, big problems how to measure that.

@_date: 2017-08-09 15:14:58

btw, my full nodes continue to run pre-segwit code, so I won't be increasing my bandwidth or disk usage with the rest of y'all.
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:05:13
well, the point here is that the consensus rule change is "locked in" and will almost certainly occur.
That's something that most here are celebrating and I understand why.  But I simply oppose *all* changes to consensus rules whether I like them technically or not, and will continue to do so.
There is already a space and term for experimenting with different consensus rules.  It is called altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:55:41
that's not really a genesis block.    seems closer to a hard-fork ala bcash.
imo, hard-forks are dangerous because they intend to either (a) become the majority and change the rules for all, or (b) dilute the value of the original chain.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:04:21
1. I consider it a useful feature that I can presently use bitcoin on a relatively low bandwidth connection and have a fully secure full node.  Segwit takes that feature away.
2. I happen to believe that the real long term value for bitcoin will derive from it being an immutable asset that is embedded everywhere and NO ONE can change, much like tcp/ip.   Any soft or hard fork takes that away, or at least delays it and sets back the cause hugely.
3. I consider it a useful feature that I can still sync the blockchain within a week and can store the blockchain on a cheap disk that is used for other things as well.  Increasing the block-size 2x, 3x, or 4x will take away those feature sooner rather than later.
4. I consider it a VERY useful feature that for a few more days at least I can still crank up a node that I installed in 2014 and transact in a fully-secure manner with nodes running today.   I do not think that people should need to upgrade their software regularly in order for their nodes to verify long-term assets held on the bitcoin network.
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:04:01
imho, any proposed change to bitcoin consensus rules is an attack.   the community should resist and defend against all such.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:26:15

Hey Adam, that's one of the reasons I personally am sticking with pre-segwit code for my full nodes.   I'll still be chugging along with 1Mb block sizes (both bandwidth and disk space) while the rest of y'all jump up to 3-4 Mb.  Enjoy!
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:01:48
no, that's exactly where you are wrong about what I'm saying.
I view *any and all* attempted changes to consensus rules as an attack, whether I otherwise would agree with the feature or not.
most people here (probably including you) consider only changes they disagree with as an attack.  that is *very* subjective.
as it happens, I prefer the core devs approach (and segwit) over any of the other proposed changes thus far.   But it is still an attack.   and so what I actually *support* is sticking with the unchanged status quo consensus rules.  forever.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:56:35
sort of opt-in, but kinda mostly not.   since version 0.13.1, bitcoin-core has only released software that will enforce segwit consensus rules (after lock-in).  And it will accept much more data across the network (up to 4 megs per block) which can overwhelm a limited connection.   To avoid that, one must run very old software without latest features, etc.
I have actually considered a software (not blockchain) fork for exactly this reason, so that users can have an up-to-date client without segwit.   It would be better though if core would simply make segwit rules *optional* in the official client.     In that case, it would truly be opt-in.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:11:13
thanks!   That's one of the more pleasant replies I've received of late.
yes, I've been making the case for status quo for a few months now.  If you read through my post history, you will see lots and lots of arguments I've been making for it.  I've been trying to speak for people that aren't part of either "camp" and just want their existing bitcoin software to keep working indefinitely.
In truth, of all the proposed rules changes of late, I approve most of segwit and *especially* a malleability fix.  So I won't shed a tear over it.  But I am philosophically opposed to all consensus rule changes (unless done with a new genesis block), so I oppose segwit primarily on those grounds, as well as the more practical bandwidth and disk usage grounds.
I did indeed consider releasing my own bitcoin-core client with segwit disabled.  And even a mining pool for like-minded individuals.  As that is the best *real* way to make one's voice heard in bitcoin.
You can read some discussion about that in this thread:
I have not actually done it primarily because I wouldn't want a possible coding mistake (or philosophy) of mine to cost other people money.  And also because of the effort involved.   and further because, well, segwit is for the most part a technical improvement in my judgement.
Still I will continue to oppose any further rules to bitcoin consensus rules, and I hope you and others will stand with me!
After segwit is fully adopted, I might yet release a (software) fork of bitcoin-core with the promise to our users that "we will never incorporate any changes to consensus rules".  And a mining pool that runs this client.   This way, like-minded people can make our voices heard better in future debates.

@_date: 2017-08-09 22:17:59
I hope you are right that it will be the last one.
I think that after segwit is adopted we need to create a bitcoin-core client that promises to our users that we will never change the consensus rules in our client.  That will be the core ethos for that client.  The more people that run it, especially mining pools, the harder it will be for this to ever happen again.  Perhaps I will fork 0.15.0 or 0.15.1 for that purpose.  ( not a blockchain fork, obviously )
though of course, I would *much* prefer that bitcoin-core devs would make this promise to end-users.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:48:16
perhaps because you haven't thought about it.   I have.

@_date: 2017-08-09 17:21:41
Try reading this thread from start to finish to hear how bitcoin devs explain it.
they make statements such as:
* It would be okay to still run a "non-SegWit" node if there's no SegWit
transactions in the chain of transactions for your bitcoins, otherwise you
cannot fully verify the the ownership of your bitcoins.
* If you mean you wish to avoid receiving UTXOs that have value that was at
one point previously encumbered by a SegWit output then no, you can't avoid
that. No more than you can currently avoid receiving BTC that were at one
point in time encumbered by a P2SH output.
* Yes, as soon as you receive new Bitcoins, there's a chance that they have
been in a SegWit transaction at some point.
* Hmm yes, if you reject a such transaction, you'll hardfork the network.
If you ignore it in your wallet, you'll be safe, but you'll lose those
bitcoins ofc. It's a difficult situation.
* You would also have to ensure that everyone you give your addresses to
follows the same rule.  As time passes, there would be fewer and fewer
people who have "clean" outputs.
* If you are running a legacy client when a soft fork comes in, then you can
be tricked with "zero confirm" transactions.  The transaction will look
good to you, but will be invalid under the new rules.  This makes your
client think you have received (a lot of) money, but in practice, the
transaction will not be accepted by the miners.
* From your perspective, the P2WPKH will look like a anyone-can-spend
transaction, thus, valid no matter who is spending. So, you would be
basically leaving the security of segwit transactions to those who actually
are interested in and using them. If your fork becomes popular, it would
decrease the security of Segwit transactions to something akin to the
security model of the Drivechain currently being discussed: only those
particularly interested in that particular sidechain (and segwit witness
could be loosely categorized into a sidechain) will be responsible to
prevent others from stealing funds from the anyone-can-spend transactions
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:57:39
but bandwidth is increased for those running segwit code even if never making a segwit tx or address yourself.  
@_date: 2017-08-10 06:00:45
Hi!  Thanks for your thoughts and insights.  good stuff.
I won't reply to each point, but will just comment that my statements regarding the degraded security of a legacy full node after segwit activation come from core developers in a lengthy conversation on the bitcoin-dev list that begins here:
It is possible I might have mis-represented something they said.  But I think the key point in that discussion is that soft-forks are not as backwards compatible as they are generally implied to be, given that new tx look like anyonecanspend to older clients, and older clients cannot fully verify any tx that has a new tx anywhere in the chain.
I think your comment regarding mining tx blind and maybe making soft forks impossible is an intriguing one.   Can you expand on that please?
I am toying with the idea of releasing a new client based on 0.15.x that would make a promise to our users never to modify the consensus rules in that codebase.   Users running this code can sort of be the "conscience" of bitcoin.  the keepers of the status quo.  So if there are additional ways to guard against soft or hard forks in code, I am interested in those.
And if I'm feeling especially ornery one day I might even release a 0.13.0 based pre segwit client, for any real stubborn users like myself.     ;-)
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:10:21
wow, well said.   someone that gets it!


yes!   bitcoin will not fulfill its destiny as an immutable and unassailable store of value until no one can force through a change to consensus rules, using any amount of persuasion.
anyone advocating for such a change is attacking bitcoin.  plain and simple.


yes, me too!  I thought there was enough disagreement in the community that a controversial change such as segwit could not occur.
It saddens me to see that bitcoin is not yet mature enough to resist such changes.

any time that social manipulation can effect a change in an organization's security policy, that is a vulnerability.
Gold does not have such a vulnerabilty because it's physical properties are fixed by nature.   If it did, people would have been changing those properties (by vote or whatever mechanism) until it was worthless.   It kept its value over centuries precisely because no person or group could change it, so it is a level playing field.
Now remind me.... why are you celebrating changing bitcoin's properties again....?
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:40:22
core devs:  I realize segwit was a compromise.  Please resist making any further changes to bitcoin consensus rules.  Let them harden and ossify like tcp/ip until bitcoin becomes an immutable rock so embedded everywhere that it cannot be changed or controlled by anyone.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:58:24

@_date: 2017-08-15 06:00:20
well thanks for listening and understanding... most have been too busy waving uasf and segwit flags, or other flags in r/btc.
If you imagine a system that is truly decentralized and embedded into consumer devices all around the world, it would be nearly impossible to upgrade...  just like tcp/ip.  And I argue that should be a primary goal.  It is critical to long term existence.   So the fact that segwit just got activated is clear evidence that bitcoin is nowhere near close to reaching its potential as a truly censorship proof hard currency.
well, segwit seems pretty close to a done deal now.  That's the power of software defaults.  And I do approve of the malleability fix at least for simplifying layer2 apps.  Once it is activated though, it may be time for some of us to start making a stand against further changes.
One thing I have thought should be done is to release a client based on bitcoin-core that makes a promise to end-users that developers will never alter the consensus rules of that client, even if all other bitcoin clients do.   Next, start a mining pool (or pools) running that client.  In this manner, those that value the status quo can begin to have a real voice and strong ability to block the would be attackers trying to "upgrade" everyone whether they like it or not.
There is already a place for experimentation in cryptocurrency consensus rules: altcoins.
@_date: 2017-08-09 01:23:26
that's like, your opinion, man.    ;-)
anyway, changes can always be made with a new genesis block in entirely opt-in fashion without imposing changes over the will of a minority of asset holders that disagree with said changes.
@_date: 2017-08-08 20:06:56
yes, congratulations on a successful attack against the bitcoin consensus rules.
the fact that they can still be changed is clear evidence that bitcoin is not (yet?) widely enough distributed and decentralized to resist political attacks.   In other words, bitcoin is too weak.   honeybadger getting kicked around like a ragdoll.
I hope this will be the last such change and I urge anyone considering future changes to side with the status quo.
I will also mention that anyone who does not want the extra bandwidth usage that will be incurred by segwit can choose to run a full node version 0.13.0 or below, which do NOT include segwit support.  That's what I intend to do, for forseeable future.

@_date: 2017-08-08 22:16:05
true.  
and I'm free to remind people that immutability and censorship resistance are fundamental to bitcoin's existence.  It's reason for being.  Any time people choose to run software that changes the rules of the game, those principles are undermined.
tell me, at what point do you see the changes ending?  what is your personal line in the sand?   and if there is none, how is that different from fiat exactly?
my line in the sand is very simple:  I oppose all changes to consensus rules except those done in conjunction with a new genesis block... aka altcoin.
again, what is yours?
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:14:44
right.  but the segwit transactions would not be considered invalid to the legacy node, they would be considered anyonecanspend.  So they are not validated "fully" because the legacy node doesn't understand the extra segwit data, but they are still "valid" with regards to accepting the block or not.  at least that is my (limited) understanding... 
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:49:28
I have been stating over and over again on this subreddit that markets value predicability and stability.  That's why gold has stood the test of time... no one could alter its phyisal properties.
The bitcoin community should stand strong against any and all proposals to change the bitcoin consensus rules and treat them as what they are:  attacks.
The trouble is that usually they come masked in "I'm here to help you clothing" such as with segwit, and called an "upgrade".
any attempt to "upgrade" bitcoin's consensus rules is an attack on bitcoin.   soft-fork, hard fork, doesn't matter.   it's a spade.
stand strong, and maintain the status quo.
The quicker this thing gets ossified into hardware and so decentralized that no one can hope to change the rules, the better.

I wish Bitpay would focus on making Copay (Bitpay Wallet) multi-user functionality usable for enterprises and real world groups.
In particular this means:
1. Ability to add/remove members (keys) from the wallet.  People get hired and/or leave the company you know.
2. A UI for read-only wallet members so that assistants may prepare transactions such as payroll, invoices, and executive(s) must authorize it.  Hidden functionality for this exists but in 2 years they have failed to add any UI for it.
I created a github issue for this a while back.  No action yet.
Decentralized multi-party payments is the key thing that differentiates Copay and makes it unique as a wallet.  It is the reason I started using it in the first place.  I think it is a shame they have apparently de-prioritized improvements to this core functionality.

you seem prone to hasty assumptions and seem to have poor reading comprehension as well.
I oppose *all* modifications to bitcoin consensus rules.    That means I oppose bcash, bu, segwit, segwit2x, etc.
So I guess what you mean is:   go back to bitcoin status quo.  Which I never left.  y'all did.
@_date: 2017-08-17 05:40:14
of course soft-forks alter consensus.   moment 1:  we all agree on a certain set of rules.  moment 2:  we agree on a modified set.   hence: consensus altered.  duh.
further, a successful (majority) soft-fork attack weakens the security model of status quo full nodes that choose not to "upgrade" to the rules of the attackers.  The status quo nodes are unable to fully verify any tx that contain an "upgraded" tx anywhere in the history, eg a segwit transaction, which appears to status quo node as anyonecanspend.  It is of course impossible for receiver to prevent receiving such tx.  Thus it is impossible to opt-out of a successful attack and yet maintain a fully-verifying node.   This little tidbit was left out of the segwit is backwards compatible marketing campaign.

changes made with forks can also do all manner of *unpredictable* things that you may not happen to like the next time one comes along.   the knife cuts both ways.
yes imho it is better that bitcoin be bitcoin and takes its chances.  There is value in remaining true to oneself, and markets value security and above all predictability.   Let other coins take chances with shiny new tech.  
It is quite possible that bitcoin will not be the eventual mass-market coin anyway.   Something like mimblewimble/grin may come along with clearly superior privacy and scalability properties.   In that case, it would be nice if bitcoin could at least say we have a track record of operating securely for the past 10 years on the same set of consensus rules without any hacks.  We are the safest place to park your funds in the cryptocurrency space.  But each time we change rules, we reset the timer on that.
Financial markets, especially big money, is conservative and risk-averse.

Hmm, my above statements were taken directly from a lengthy discussion on the bitcoin-dev list.  Here's a relevant comment from Hampus.
Given that each utxo can be traced all the way back to the genesis block, it seems to me that so long as that chain has zero segwit tx, then my node can still fully validate any received tx containing such utxo.  Which is also what Hampus and others were saying.  Are we missing something?

all attempted forks (soft and hard) are attacks on the bitcoin consensus rules, by definition.
Segwit was an attack that was marketed as an "upgrade" and included in the most popular bitcoin client.  It has popular support here, and will likely succeed long-term, though some, such as I will continue to run pre-segwit nodes for forseeable future.
For bitcoin to be strong and censorship proof, the community must learn to deny attacks on consensus rules, in all their forms.

guess what.  a lot of people like bitcoin precisely because it cannot be arbitrarily changed by a small group of people.
There is a term for that sort of currency:  fiat.    literally, by whim of the elite.  without consent of the holders of the currency.
"changing one protocol setting" if it is part of the consensus layer should require VERY high agreement of those holding/using the currency.  Ideally 100% agreement.
If you don't like it.... well too bad.    bitcoin don't care.
@_date: 2017-08-19 05:58:36
I agree with most of your points, and yes core is somewhat conservative and core devs make many statements I agree with.
I actually wish however that they would be even MORE conservative, and make the following promise:
"We will not change the consensus rules in bitcoin core ever."
That would be truly conservative, and would give the market faith that this is something rock solid and the rug will never be pulled out from underneath.
let others hard or soft-fork all they want.  But the steadfast status quo client shall endure and remain true to self.
Since core has not yet made this promise, we must demand it of them.
@_date: 2017-08-09 22:46:24
I like the bitcoin wiki page you linked.  I agree with what I read there.  I have long been saying that the notion of "governance" in cryptocurrency is basically missing the point and self-defeating.
So I especially like the summary:


Unfortunately bip148ers and 141ers *have* forced their views on us.   True, we can still run older full nodes without segwit, but only with a much-weakened security level, more equivalent to SPV, due to the "anyone-can-spend" nature of soft-forks.
Beware all of you that supported this change:  the same can happen to you, for future changes that you do NOT agree with.
@_date: 2016-12-10 09:30:05
ah good.  Well, I'm happy to see more work being done on sharding.  It seems to me that long-term, some type of sharding is the only way to really scale on-chain.
Though I imagine that in this design there could still be full nodes that archive everything (all shards), right?   That could help with the problem if all members of a particular shard are unavailable or overloaded for some reason.

@_date: 2016-12-10 09:43:43
I would argue tha the fact that bitcoin consensus code is so difficult to change is *the most important thing* that secures bitcoin's value.
Otherwise what do we have?  We must trust in some sort of benevolent dictator's to make the right decisions?  Sounds like fiat to me.
Actually, I'll re-phrase.  I have no issue with hard-forks so long as the forked branch creates a new genesis block, the way that monero did when it forked from bytecoin.  This is a way to innovate, yet does not break the implied contract with holders of the original coins.
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:21:09
Hi, yes I've read that post before.  I think he makes good arguments, but do not agree with his conclusions, even speaking as a libertarian/voluntaryist myself.
My position is that the contract I have with "Bitcoin" is that Bitcoin operates under a given set of consensus rules, as defined by the consensus layer code.  If those rules somehow change, then that is a contract change.  Normally contract changes require agreement by all parties, unless otherwise stated.  and I didn't agree.
hard-fork, soft-fork.  doesn't matter.  it's still a change to the contract.  and still it is something I could never have known was coming when I started using bitcoin and did not agree to then.
Now, the consensus layer rules of bitcoin operate on the assumption that all other nodes follow the same rules.  There is no mechanism that I am aware of built into any version of bitcoin that is an explicit definition of how to change the rules. Thus, any change to the rules must have been performed without my foreknowledge.
I would agree that the situation would be different IF the code provides a clear-cut mechanism and explanation for how to change the rules, and if that was clearly communicated to each and every coin investor up front.  There might be some altcoins that already satisfy this criteria.  Dash may come close, but its "governance" mechanism was added later, so that's still a moral hazard for previous holders.  Perhaps a recent clone of Dash.   getting into the weeds now.
This is all just a lengthy way to say that I view any and all changes to consensus rules in bitcoin as immoral acts.  a form of tyranny of the majority.   The only moral way at this point is to issue a new genesis block along with the code change.   This is better known as an altcoin.  That is an entirely opt-in procedure.
What you say about rejecting rather than ignoring blocks it doesn't understand is somewhat interesting to me.   I am considering releasing a bitcoin-client that makes a promise to our end users that we will never change the consensus rules.  Do you think that rejecting mis-understood blocks would somehow further or strengthen that goal?  In fact, how is "rejecting" different from "ignoring"?     I do *not* want to split the network of course.

@_date: 2016-12-05 09:00:18
From another perspective, this is both the most likely 
scenario and the best-case scenario.
1. This is the most likely scenario because controversial changes in bitcoin by definition do not have consensus, and thus are unlikely to be adopted.  By now it should be clear to all that block-size limit changes are controversial, and likely will always be so.  Even if core devs propose it.
2. A valuable property of a currency is immutability.  Another way of saying this is predictability.  If a currency's propertys change at the whim of the crowd, why would I or anyone wish to invest in it long-term?   Keeping bitcoin unchanged at the protocol layer will prove to the world that an immutable digital currency is possible.   Thus, changing bitcoin's core properties this late in the game would undermine its core value proposition.
I've kept quiet during this entire block-size limit debate because I believe it is much ado about nothing.  Ultimately, bitcoin will remain fundamentally unchanged.  Sidechain's and alt-coins and lightning networks will swirl all around it, and bitcoin will still be bitcoin.
This was pretty much baked in from the beginning, and predictable enough.
The surprise would be if somehow consensus is achieved to hard-fork the consensus protocol.  At that point, I would fear for the future of all cryptocurrency and seriously re-think further involvement.

1. I'm glad to see bitcoin-ng getting some love.
2. so each shard (hash bucket) corresponds to a single service type, right, eg a DNS service.  Does that mean that if I'm running a DNS service node that I must process ALL the transactions for that service?
If every DNS node must process all DNS tx, it seems to me that the DNS service will soon bump into the same types of scalability issues that bitcoin has now.
( If you think there are not enough DNS tx to cause trouble, just consider if visa decided to run as an Aspen service. )
Or is there a further level of sharding that somehow divides the DNS service tx between nodes?
@_date: 2016-12-10 09:37:07
I agree with your comments about soft forks.  They too are undesirable.   Probably within a few years bitcoin will ossify to the point where even a soft-fork is pretty much impossible.  maybe we're already there.  I'm good with that.
@_date: 2017-08-09 20:17:00
yes.  exactly.  good point.
a "company" is just a fiction for individuals to hide behind.   In the case of corporations, it is literally a government enforced liability shield that prevents individuals from being held responsible for their actions, and is thus morally wrong.  ( I just blew some people's minds, no doubt. )
In Adam's quote above, I quite ignored the term "company" in my mind, and substituted the individuals directing such companies.  The meaning is effectively the same:


@_date: 2017-08-09 16:58:22


I agree with this quote 100%.
What most here fail to realize or rationalize away, is that the quote applies equally to *any* proposed consensus rule change, whether it be a hardfork or a softfork.  yes:  segwit included.   Think about it:  if bitcoin were *truly* decentralized and distributed to everyone all around the world similar to tcp/ip, then practically no changes could be made.
I will thus refine the statement to:


@_date: 2019-08-08 15:28:24
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:01:49


so by this logic, is segwit itself not an attack on bitcoin?
I would argue that it is.
an immutable, ossified bitcoln is the only strong, safe, and secure bitcoin.  think:  tcp/ip.
one that can be changed by politics on a few internet forums is a weak, insecure coin.
agree or disagree?
@_date: 2016-12-22 18:51:55
I understand and mostly agree with your points.   When I first heard about transaction malleability it kind of blew my mind that such a problem could exist, and it must be fixed.
Still, I take the position that immutability and honoring the social contract is even more important in a currency, and is THE novel and interesting thing in a digital currency like bitcoin.  The core value proposition.  Also, just practically speaking, I think segwit is way too controversial to achieve consensus at a 95% level.
So let's for the moment assume that bitcoin is basically ossified and there will never be another significant fork (soft or hard) to fix fundamental flaws.
In that case, we are locked in.  A couple of things might happen:
1) Layer 2 tech is sufficient to scale bitcoin (as-is) and improve privacy/fungibility.  bitcoin maintains the  spot.
2) Another crypto currency solves these issues and launches fairly.  It maintains a no-fork policy from the start.  It then out-competes bitcoin because it is superior in scaling and privacy.
I think that both of these outcomes are better than one in which bitcoin goes down the ethereum fork path.   If another strongly immutable currency comes along that is just clearly better, then I'll happily switch to it, and I think it would be a pretty natural and smooth thing for the market to do.
Monero might be a contender for this, except that they hard-fork regularly, and they scale similarly to bitcoin, even a little worse. It could be that in a year or two or three they have layer 2 tech for scaling and stop forking due to community size and inertia.  That might work.    Or once they reach a point that is clearly technologically better than bitcoin, someone could fork and re-start monero with a new genesis block and a "no-fork" ethos.
many possibilities.  It will be very interesting to watch how this all plays out.   I think it will be ugly and bad for the entire ecosystem though if the bitcoin community itself forks while bitcoin is   I personally would lose a lot of faith in the entire concept of cryptocurrency if there is not at least 1 immutable blockchain in the world.

1. ~99.999+ percent of unbanked remain unbanked and don't use bitcoin.
2. majority of "bitcoin users" do not run p2p code (eg bitcoin-core) at all.
3. In a truly decentralized mining setup, everyone would help secure the network and receive rewards in exact proportion to the computational power contributed.  So even a r-pi or apple II could technically participate.   When viewed from this lense, mining is sadly much closer to fully centralized than it is to fully de-centralized.
4. Unduplicatable.   so far, with exception of some bugs.

I have been worried since 2013 that the core devs don't seem to be addressing these issues.

So maybe sidechains + zerocash or sidechains + dash or sidechains + monero will end up being the long term solution.
and if the sidechain gets popular because of the privacy it affords, people may have less and less reason to cash it back into bitcoin.

Bip44 defines an address gap limit of 20 unused addresses.
Account discovery
When the master seed is imported from an external source the software should start to discover the accounts in the following manner:
    derive the first account's node (index = 0)
    derive the external chain node of this account
    scan addresses of the external chain; respect the gap limit described below
    if no transactions are found on the external chain, stop discovery
    if there are some transactions, increase the account index and go to step 1
This algorithm is successful because software should disallow creation of new accounts if previous one has no transaction history, as described in chapter "Account" above.
Please note that the algorithm works with the transaction history, not account balances, so you can have an account with 0 total coins and the algorithm will still continue with discovery.
Address gap limit
Address gap limit is currently set to 20. If the software hits 20 unused addresses in a row, it expects there are no used addresses beyond this point and stops searching the address chain. We scan just the external chains, because internal chains receive only coins that come from the associated external chains.
Wallet software should warn when the user is trying to exceed the gap limit on an external chain by generating a new address.

Who controls version bits for signalling soft-forks, upgrades?
The pool?  Or the hashers?
During the time of segwit soft-fork, the pools were signalling on behalf of all the hashers, which gives the pools too much power.
Does stratumv2 fix this?

@_date: 2015-07-10 17:49:34
I like copay.    important question though for usage in a company:   Is there any way to revoke keys?       Or if not, how to deal with situation where an employee holding key leaves the company or moves to another position?   Ideally one would be able to remove that person from the wallet and add a new person to replace them.
@_date: 2015-07-11 08:03:15
So device permissions are a CoPay showstopper for me on Android.  In particular, the app requires the user's identity.  
That's unacceptable for privacy, and the desktop app certainly didn't ask for any personally identifying information.   I hope this was just an oversight and will be corrected in the next version.
Here are the permissions that version 1.1.1 requires:
* Photos/Media/Files




* Camera


* Device ID &amp; call information


* Other






I don't know if the android framework supports this, but I would much prefer if bitcoin wallet apps installed with basically zero perms and user is prompted the first time app wants to use a particular perm, eg camera for QR code.   If user says no, then app disables that functionality.

There are significant technical (scaling) issues to solve between here and "major credit card" size.   So that may take longer than we think.

It seems to me that if Satoshi intended it, then he should have committed the code.
This was clearly a foreseeable problem that was discussed at the time, and it is/was also well known that concensus changes become more difficult the larger the network is.
As such, it seems to me that Satoshi was irresponsible to leave the community without first implementing it.
Either that, or didn't really intend for the limit to be raised.

best ways to get bitcoin:
1) buy in person, with cash.  Try localbitcoin.com
2) buy with cash from a lamassu atm.
3) perform a service for somebody and get paid in bitcoin.
always make sure that you hold/control the keys yourself.  avoid tying your identity to the btc unless you wish to be tracked for all time.
coinbase and other online services that hold the keys for customers are like an unregulated bank.  ie, a step backwards.

I wonder if there is a way to prove that a server is running a specific version of software.
If so, then one could open-source the software with a hash for each version that users can verifiy themselves.   The trick then is to provide a proof that the server is running the published version.   perhaps impossible....?

why does it have to be either?   
Let's instead start a new coin with a clean, modular codebase that gets rid of the legacy technical debt and bakes in all the amazing innovations that people have come up with:  confidential transactions, mimblewimble, lightning, and so on.   People can then opt-in or out by market processes: buying and selling rather than reddit politics and chest thumping.
think outside the echo chamber.
@_date: 2016-02-21 18:22:05
yes.  this.
changing consensus rules for anything that is even the slightest bit controversial undermines trust in bitcoin and also the very concept of cryptocurrency.
Improvements for scalability and privacy/fungibility should be done in altcoins.  When one of them finally gets it "right", informed people will switch.  This is just the market at work.
People have a wrong-headed notion that there needs to be governance in bitcoin.  Bitcoin already has governance.    It is the consensus code that we've all been running for years. 
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:40:12
I just took a look at paxful.com.  I got the impression it is a recent competitor to localbitcoins, and is innovating faster, so I was curious and hopeful.
My primary criteria for obtaining bitcoins is that it must be a private transaction without personally identifying information introduced at any point.  Probably a lot of these "new users" would want that too.
So the first thing I notice is that you require an email address.  So right there is a barrier to entry.  I'm either not going to register, or must take the time/effort to setup a fake email somewhere.  strike 1.
okay, so I just want to find somebody local to buy some bitcoins from. In person.  with cash.  Instead what I see when I click "Buy Bitcoin" is a ton of online options.  To me, online pretty much always means:  invades my privacy.   I did see on the wiki that there is an in person trade option, but it didn't actually appear in the marketplace.  strike 2.
frustrated, I left.  Fortunately, I have other ways to obtain bitcoins if I should need to.
But i will not be recommending this service to anyone as-is.
@_date: 2017-04-06 05:51:59
fine, but that's not what I'm saying.   Bitcoin should not have any further consensus level changes. See my recent post history for details.
@_date: 2017-04-27 06:01:02
or... we could just accept the reality that bitcoin is bitcoin, and that it is specifically designed to resist controversial changes.
what you are proposing is an attempted hijacking of bitcoin.
There is a well known way to introduce new cryptocurrency features that do not have consensus.    fork the code, or better yet write cleaner more modular code from scratch.  start a new genesis block.  clean break.

I don't see why not, so long as it continues following the same consensus protocol.
@_date: 2015-07-10 18:46:42
yeah, I thought of that, but it seems messy because:
  1) It's a hassle for everyone to have to create/join a new wallet each time there is a change of staff.
  2) Transaction history is interrupted.  So now multilple wallets have to be dug through and stitched together when preparing accounting reports.

except that bitcoin was created to be an asset, like gold.  not a form of governance that varies over time and according to popular opinion.
if people *could* change the properties of gold, undoubtedly they would.  So it is fortunate they cannot.  This keeps a level playing field for all parties.
actually, I rather like the idea of this Liberum_veto for cryptocurrency.  A consensus rule could be made that for any soft-forks, if a single block in the last N blocks vetos, then the soft-fork will not take effect.  If I were designing a new coin, I would investigate putting something like that in place to try and ensure the coin remains immutable after launch.
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:17:50
Bitcoin is already useful as an asset.  It is stable.  It is secure, to the best of our knowledge.
not only that, it was designed to resist change at the consensus layer.
So why exactly do you think it must evolve?   Does gold need to evolve?  omg, who is maintaining gold?!!  It's failing to adapt to all the new competition!!!!!!
Anyway, I am just speaking up so that it is clear that not everyone is on the "bitcoin must change" bandwagon.

@_date: 2016-02-21 02:04:43
Personally I think that changing any consensus rules in bitcoin weakens trust in all cryptocurrencies.   Why?  because if one parameter can change, so can another.
Any hard-forks that are the tiniest bit controversial will erode trust/confidence in all cryptocurrency, not only bitcoin, and even for those that supported the change.  Because maybe they won't be supporting the next one.
The approach to scaling I would prefer is to try out new designs in altcoins/sidechains.   If the tech and fundamentals are better, it will become the more popular and valuable coin over time.
And if that one has some sort of scaling or privacy problem, then another one can fix it.
Yes, this means that the consensus rules, decentralization, and scalability need to be "right" from the very start of a coin.
But by the same token, it is open source and new coins can be started at whim.  So once the right tech is in place, it can be launched, and should flower.
People heavily invested in bitcoin may not like this notion, but it logically stems from the intrinsic nature of a system that is massively decentralized and requires near 100% consensus to change without problems.
Those looking for "blockchain governance models" are barking up the wrong tree.
If you truly have a better mousetrap, fork the code.  Create a new genesis block.  Otherwise, the governance is the existing code that people have opted in to, and are already running.  deal with it.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:50:58
my logic does not mean that the world would not have p2sh.
It does mean that we might be using a new coin (blockchain+code) that has p2sh implemented more cleanly because it did not have to be implemented as a soft-fork.
I can somewhat agree with you about the 20B cap being small.  And in truth, if  segwit goes through, I will get over it.
But I am arguing for a principle here, which is that controversial changes should not be made at the consensus layer, and more broadly, that consensus layer changes belong on a new blockchain entirely.
And that if we want shiny new things, like CT, mimblewimble, lightning, we should just make a new coin for them, rather than trying to mutate bitcoin to fit.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:27:40
sure, why not?  :-)
umm, except I'd like to see all the new scalability and privacy innovations in a shiny new coin.  How does that fit?
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:59:54
yeah, that was my thinking a year or two back.  but it didn't happen.
I came to accept and admire the reality that bitcoin resists controversial changes.  And most proposed consensus layer changes will be controversial from here on out.
now I think that immutability is the most important and precious thing.  anything else can be layer 2, or built on a new blockchain.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:41:59
thanks for the thoughtful reply.  good insights.
I know that many of the world's most intelligent people are working in this space.  Some of them simply because it is an interesting and challenging problem domain, that suddenly has real world application/utility.
Also there is bitcoin maximalism, as you say.  So maybe not many of the top theorists are eager to build a new coin now, or they are just waiting because they think segwit still has a good chance to activate.
But that sentiment can easily change the longer and harder bitcoin resists change.
A great example of this is zCash.  I remember seeing Mathew Green talk about ZeroCash at the 2013 bitcoin conference.  Bitcoin resisted that sort of change, arguably for good reasons.  Eventually they got tired of waiting and politicking, and built an alt-coin instead.   Sadly it has big problems  (opt-in privacy, trusted setup, slow tx, for profit company, etc) but that doesn't have to be the case.
I am trying to inject into the conversation the idea that we don't have to get so mired down waiting for segwit to activate.  ( which may never happen )   If some of these top researchers can bring their projects together we might get something really great.
Also, it does not have to kill bitcoin.  maybe, maybe not.  but only one way to find out.
@_date: 2017-04-06 06:38:28
would it not work just as well if all the miners used asicboost?  Then it would be a level playing field again, and no need to change bitcoin consensus layer.

Is it only the patent preventing this?   that would be a shame... 
@_date: 2017-04-05 17:19:17
yes.  the bitcoin community should reject all forks, both hard and soft.  
Bitcoin's primary value springs from the fact that it is very resistant to change.  
@_date: 2017-04-03 20:30:09
a BU hard fork might hurt bitcoin's price in the near term but I doubt it would do any lasting damage.  I believe that the economic majority will  stay with the original BTC consensus rules and lessons will be learned, but bitcoin will emerge stronger and still unchanged.  People would likely begin to value it even more as they begin to realize how truly resistant to change it is.
@_date: 2017-04-20 21:02:56


this.   too many people have been caught up in the drama and politics, trying to change something designed to resist change.
It is my firm belief that bitcoin will be just fine as it is, even if segwit should not be adopted.   Indeed, there is perhaps greater value to a cryptocurrency that can navigate an environment where everyone is trying to change it, and instead stand firm and fast like a rock.
to me, the past year has been much ado about nothing. 
I would actually prefer that some of the state-of-the-art and experimental advances for privacy and scaling ( eg segwit, lightning, mimblewimble, sidechains, confidential transactions, schnorr sigs) be incorporated into a new modular codebase with clean design and a new genesis block.  sort of a bitcoinv2, while bitcoinv1 remains rock steady, secure, and immutable.
It would need to be done by an expert team though, like... err, blockstream or core.
Do you see any chances of something like that happening in next 1-5 years Greg?
@_date: 2017-04-03 23:02:08
At a technical level, I think it is a good thing.   Most people seem to agree, which is why it was activated.
At a moral and conceptual level, I think it is wrong to modify the consensus rules of a widely held cryptocurrency.  period.   So I would oppose it on those grounds.
Let's forget bitcoin for a moment.  If I were to launch a new coin, let's call it dandacoin,  here's what I would do:
1. Collaborate with experts in the field and do a lot of work up front and put all the best features (state of the art) into it.  Things like mimblewimble, segwit, confidential transactions, schnorr signatures, integrated lightning network, etc.
2. Endeavor to make the consensus layer code immutable and non-upgradeable at time of initial release.  Investigate if it is possible for a single miner to veto any soft-fork, for example.
3. whoops!  somebody invented a shiny new thing that is clearly superior and people want it dandacoin.  too bad!  dandacoin is a fixed, unchangeable thing.  But we can instead release superdandacoin with a brand new genesis block that includes the shiny new thing and any other consensus level fixes or changes we've decided are desirable.
4. The market can now freely trade between dandacoin and superdandacoin.  dandacoin will have the larger market share to start.  So the market will decide if the new feature(s) are worth the switching cost or not.
5.  After a few iterations of this, perhaps spanning 20 years or more, we will likely reach a point at which superextraduperdandacoin is "good enough" and nothing new ever supplants it.
So, bringing this back to bitcoin, it means I believe that OP_CLTV, segwit, and any other proposed changes should have been released in a codebase with a new genesis block.  Indeed I wish the core devs would devote at least half their time to such a project, and the other half to bitcoin maintenance and layer 2 solutions.
Further, if bitcoin had had a policy like this from the start, we never would have had the last 2 years of debate and infighting, with the community impotently trying to apply political methods to technical limitations.  Instead, each consensus change would have been released with a new genesis block and the market would have decided whether to adopt or not, and how quickly.
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:21:57
that's true, to a point.
Except that bitcoin-core post 0.13.1 does not give any option, so the only way to explicitly not support segwit and not run new consensus code when validating blocks (post soft-fork) is to remain on older versions.
If i get annoyed enough, I might start a fork that allows the user to truly opt-out.  Or somebody likely will anyway.

@_date: 2017-04-19 20:47:49
maybe you lose them.  a couple of points though.
1. what customers, and so what if we lose them?   bitcoin is not a company, it is a technology.  if a better tech comes along, and the market chooses it instead, that's ok in my book.  it would be a gradual thing and people will have time to sense the wind and diversify.   Very different than if new code gets hacked, ala "theDao" or the billion btc bug.
2. there is real value to being the first, and to being a steady, unchanging rock that withstands the winds and seas of shifting public opinion.  I firmly believe that if bitcoin does not change one iota (at the consensus layer) that it can and will become the most valuable asset class on earth.
3. In contrast, changing the consensus layer means that bitcoin does bend and move about.  that it can be manipulated.  why should I trust it any longer?   what else can be manipulated?  fiat.  this makes it less interesting as a long-term investment.
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:52:10


@_date: 2017-04-20 23:31:16
fair enough.  but with soft forks one could change pretty much anything.  so that's clearly a step too far, in my book.
I'm not a crypto expert, but I wonder if it would be possible (for an imaginary new coin) to have something like "proof-of-code" for consensus layer, so that miners and tx senders must proof they are running the agreed upon consensus code.   of course, this means the consensus rules would need to be formally specified, as a basic starting point.
@_date: 2017-04-19 20:29:50
on the contrary.  indecisiveness is a symptom of bitcoin's greatest strength.
bitcoin is extremely resistant to any consensus level change that is controversial.  that's what makes it a serious contender as a long-term asset.
that is an amazing property for something digital.  for code.  that is why I like it. 
the day that a controversial change such as segwit, bu, or classic gets adopted is the day I will begin doubting the long-term viability of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:35:11
I've yet to see any coin that is private, scaleable, and instant.  I hope that some of the brightest minds that are working on the next gen tech tire of waiting for segwit and decide to launch a new, truly innovative blockchain instead.
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:00:51
I'm not advocating that " innovations, if successful, will be taken over by bitcoin".  Rather I'm advocating that bitcoin remain unchanged, as a stable and predictable store of value, while new innovations happen elsewhere.

Hi, a month or so back I wrote a CLI tool where you just enter your BTC addresses from your wallet and it will spit out a CSV spreadsheet with all your transactions during a given date range with the daily average value from bitcoinaverage.com, and also running totals.  Should be helpful for supplying cost basis to an accountant for all transactions in/out.
Works with any wallet, so long as you can export all your addresses, including change addresses.
I'm working on a website interface for it, but if there's interest, I could upload the CLI tool to github in the meantime.
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:27:50
I can't argue with you there.
Sadly though I haven't heard of any better proposal for mining that doesn't eventually lead to a similar situation.
Ideally it seems like mining would be fully decentralized amongst all users such that all users are compensated for securing the network according to the work they contribute.  Sort of like p2pool on steroids.  
The winner-take-all nature of block rewards work against this.  
I would be very interested to learn of a mechanism that is as secure and scalable as the present model but enables decentralized proportional payouts.
I guess one of the problems with p2pool is all the dust amounts it pays out, leaving a lot of tiny UTXO.   I guess any similar system would have the same issue....

in reality, I prefer (and predict) that bitcoin's consensus layer not be changed significantly, ever.
I'm just saying that if we *are* going to do so, the prudent way to do that, and also a better way to build consensus, would be to try it on an alt with smaller market cap first.  So at least it gets seriously poked at for a year or so.

You assume too much.
I have never supported BU, classic, or anything other than unmodified bitcoin.  I have never even posted on and think that is a silly place.
I understand the technical improvements in segwit.  I wish they had been built in from the start, especially a malleability fix.   But I accept they were not.

@_date: 2017-04-19 20:07:27
1. I accept the reality that bitcoin is highly resistant to controversial changes, by design.
2. I observe that segwit would be a controversial change.
3. I am OK with the idea that bitcoin's consensus layer will likely never change signficantly, because it is already too widely used for that.
4. I observe the reality that bitcoin can never scale to mass adoption on-chain.  segwit or no segwit.
5. I believe the most likely future path will be that bitcoin is used as a settlement layer.   Likely for something like lightning network, but it could also be used by banks, credit card issuers, etc.  Such that average people would never even see bitcoin.  For that, high tx fees are not a problem.
6. As a software engineer, I understand that all new code carries security risks, no matter how well tested.  In an asset, I believe that to be a bad thing.
namecall all you like.  That won't change the fact that segwit is controversial, and bitcoin resists contoversial changes.
ignoring that is....  ignorant.

So, as a lightning designer/implementer, I would suggest that:
1.  the initial implementation contain an API to facilitate these use cases without risking user's security and privacy.
2. Ideally, you could provide basic working clients (web page and mobile app) that do things in a p2p fashion, without requiring any secrets or identity info on the server(s).
I think that if those elements are correctly baked in from the start, then we can avoid a lot of the early centralized mis-steps that the bitcoin wallet ecosystem had.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:10:02
perhaps it will become irrelevant. I happen to think it will become the world's most important asset class, provided it does not change.  think of birkshire hathaway.  or gold.    time will tell.
Fortunately, my side (that of no consensus level change) need do nothing except wait and watch, while the big blockers and segwit camps battle.  So long as both sides have any significant numbers, no change will happen.
But we need  not forgo technical improvements.  
There is entirely another way to make huge improvements.  
imho, what we should do is to take all the best proposals that have been made for bitcoin such as segwit, lightening, mimblewimble, confidential transactions, etc, and create a next-gen blockchain with privacy, instant payments, and scalability baked in from the start.   call it bitcoinv2 maybe.
So bitcoin v1 remains this super stable, unchangeble asset.  And bitcoinv2 is the sexy "for the masses" coin that might finally get real adoption.
bitcoiners do not have to lose out either.  We can buy into it very early compared to everyone else.
Plus, bitcoinv1, as an unchangeable thing with proven secure track record, will likely continue to go up in value as well as a high-value settlement system.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:51:28
I respect the bitcoin core devs for setting a high bar for segwit activation.  And I think the bitcoin community gets it more than a lot of others.
Even still, I feel that the great majority of commenters here are in a mad rush to change bitcoin "somehow", and only a very few of us are saying:  whoa, hold on.  maybe we are getting the cart before the horse here.  Let's not mess with a good thing.
@_date: 2017-04-03 21:10:43
nope.  It is too controversial.    Bitcoin steadfastly resists controversial changes.
That is, in fact, bitcoin's greatest strength.  
The sooner people realize this and make peace with it, the better.
Layer 2 solutions can still happen without segwit.
If the physical properties of gold could be changed willy nilly by this faction or that faction, then gold would not have been a stable unit of exchange over thousands of years.
The most amazing thing about bitcoin is that it has been largely able to reproduce this inflexible, immutable property in digital form.
Seemingly too few appreciate this, and instead rush headlong to change it to suit their "vision".
I too, wish that bitcoin did not have a malleability problem, or the quadratic hashing problem.  But too bad.  Bitcoin is what is it.
like ipv4, it is becoming ossified.  too big and widespread and permeated and baked in and actually used, to be changed.  and that's a good thing.
What about all the fancy new things that have been invented in the past 4+ years?   mimblewimble, confidential transactions/assets, segwit, schnorr sigs, etc, etc.   Someone should combine all those things and create a shiny new coin with a new genesis block, aka an altcoin.  If it is truly better, and also resistant to change, then it could have a real chance to compete with bitcoin in the marketplace, and perhaps even beat it.
THAT is the way to upgrade cryptocurrency software.
I haven't even touched yet on the most important argument, which is the moral one.
People have invested time/energy/money/resources into bitcoin for the last 7 years under a certain set of rules.  The consensus layer code can be thought of as a public contract, held by individuals worldwide.
Changing that contract, without 100% consensus, is an immoral act because it will materially affect the value of those investments and may well harm certain individuals.  Yes, that means that every bitcoin holder must be in agreement for the act to be considered moral.   Since that is never going to happen, then morally speaking, bitcoin consensus rules should never be changed.
Finally, it must be said that markets value predictability in assets.  If it is proven that bitcoin can be changed without near unanimous agreement, ie blowing in the wind, then bitcoin's status as the world's first and longest running unchanged digital asset will be shattered.  How markets will react, I cannot say, but I do strongly believe that markets will be quite happy when both segwit and BU fail, as there is every indication they both will.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:25:15


I care about bitcoin for what it can offer the world.  Nor would I lose personal profit from segwit. Yet I do not support adding segwit.
There is entirely another way to make big improvements, without wrenching around in bitcoin's innards mid-flight.
imho, what we should do as a community is to take all the best proposals that have been made for bitcoin such as segwit, lightning, mimblewimble, confidential transactions, etc, and create a next-gen blockchain with privacy, instant payments, and scalability baked in from the start. call it bitcoinv2 maybe.
So bitcoin v1 remains this super stable, unchangeable asset. And bitcoinv2 is the sexy "for the masses" coin with capacity and characteristics for real worldwide adoption.
bitcoiners do not have to lose out either. We can buy into it very early compared to everyone else, and/or mine.
Plus, bitcoinv1, as an unchangeable thing with proven secure track record, will likely continue to go up in value as well as a high-value settlement system.
I think you are correct about one thing:  people here have a lot of skin in the game.  
They cannot conceive that something beside bitcoin could be the thing that the world will eventually adopt.   But they see that "bitcoin" is not ready for that, so they try to mutate it into something else.  
@_date: 2017-04-29 07:27:03
If this is a war, then I guess I'm switzerland.  because I won't be joining either side.
and the more both sides debate and dig in, the less likely it is that bitcoin's protocol will change, which makes me happy.  A stable store of value requires something that is .... drum roll... stable.
@_date: 2017-04-19 22:19:54
I think that the market will value coins that stay immutable and unchanging.  So if bitcoin chooses that path, it could be a big winner.  think:  berkshire hathaway.
I might be wrong of course.  but I do think that those who so fervently want "change" forget the value of stability, security, predictability.  these are hard to achieve in digital form and are valued by financial markets.
that said, if there is a serious bug/flaw in the consensus code, it will likely garner enough consensus to change without serious risk of a chain split.  I can see the practicality of that, without starting up a new blockchain.
I do not propose a new coin for every change.  Think rather, of a new coin say every 2-4 years.  So we can do research and then put the latest advancements into a new coin.  
Of course, the current reality is that we are getting new coins much more often than that, but most do not have real advancements in them.
I am thinking of something like a linux distro, say Ubuntu or Redhat, that stewards and regularly bundles together the state of the art of crypto innovations into a brand new release.
Eventually, the perfect combo may be hit upon, and no further changes necessary.  But in the meantime, we aren't screwing around making major changes to peoples cryptocoins in-flight.
@_date: 2017-04-04 22:42:30
I give the core devs a lot of credit for setting such a high bar.
@_date: 2017-04-12 05:49:25
so... people tried to convince me that bitcoin should be changed.
I'll agree with that about the same time I agree that the innate properties of gold should change.
anyway.... no one answered my question.
How can I show my support for status quo bitcoin, without consensus layer change?
k, thx bye.
@_date: 2017-04-30 01:01:42

yet at the same time if "the world" moves to cryptocurrency, and even a small fraction of them value the security and stability and unchanging-ness of bitcoin, then that could still be much larger and more valuable than today.
but yes, it could drop to zero also.  pays to be nimble.

@_date: 2017-04-19 20:12:29
tested, schmested.
It won't really be tested until it is protecting significant real assets.  That's when it will receive a trial by fire.
A logical, rational person would prefer to try that experiment first with a much smaller honeypot, say $1 million USD or so, rather than the largest where an exploit could do the most damage.
I bet the people here begging for segwit without a second thought about security would be amongst the first to call for some kind of eth style blockchain rollback after they lose funds.
@_date: 2017-04-19 21:38:00
haha.   yes ltc would be a good test case, as it provides a sizeable honeypot.
but really I think the right way to go about things is to launch a brand new blockchain with all the latest innovations baked in, eg lightning, mimblewimble, confidential transactions, for starters.

thanks!    :-)
@_date: 2017-04-03 18:57:48
This guy Oleg gets it.  Markets like predictable assets.
The discussion of late has been framed as segwit vs BU.  But that ignores the elephant in the room.  There is a third view, which holds that the consensus rules of bitcoin should not (and probably cannot) be changed, ever.  Individuals that hold this view have been largely silent because it is most likely that we will prevail in the face of controversy without having to lift a finger.  Bitcoin resists controversial changes.  The more that segwit and BU camps dig in, the more likely bitcoin will stay the same.
Of late, I hear more and more people coming to the realization that we may not get a malleability fix.  That's sad, but layer 2 solutions can be built anyway.
There are lots of amazing tech/features that people have invented for bitcoin.  But they will never be "in" bitcoin.  Those things should be bundled together and make a shiny new altcoin.   If it too is inflexible, then it may one day have a chance to outperform bitcoin in the market.
The amazing thing about bitcoin is that its rules are inflexible.  If the physical properties of gold could be changed at the whim of this faction or that, it would not have been useful for thousands of years.
@_date: 2017-04-19 16:51:10
I understand it.  I think it is great.    For an altcoin.
Please keep bitcoin consensus code UNCHANGED.
As Andreas Ant. has pointed out many times, including most recent LTB, new code is risky.  For bitcoin new code carries a 20 Billion dollar bug bounty.
I personally am not willing to take that risk.  with my funds or that of others.
Bitcoin code should be thought of as if it is aeronautics code, that carries people's lives on it.  Because it does.
There is no reason that segwit, lightning, mimblewimble and all sorts of cool new tech cannot be tried out first in a new coin.  When that new coin has a billion dollar plus market-cap and has not been hacked, then *maybe* it should be considered for bitcoin.
until then, leave bitcoin alone please.
k, thx bye!
@_date: 2017-04-20 04:57:57

yes.  sadly though none yet (to my knowledge) include the latest innovations that segwit is supposed to enable such as lightning, confidential transactions, sidechains.
most are just bitcoin clones of one type or another.
What I am proposing is a new coin/team that engages with the top researchers in this space to build something that is a real step forward in terms of privacy/fungibility, scalability, and usability.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:38:33
implications:  bitcoin will stay a fixed, predictable thing.  Which is what markets want.
If the physical properties of gold changed willy nilly based on the whims of this faction or that, it would not have been useful over thousands of years.
The truly amazing thing about bitcoin is that somebody figured out how to mimic this fixed and unchanging property of gold in a digital form. 
And yet it seems the majority of people here do not appreciate that at all, and instead keep trying to change it according to their desires.
Let bitcoin be bitcoin.
honey badger don't care.
if you want this feature or that, make an altcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-19 23:35:43
the complexity of code and the great potential for security exploits in new code is a key reason for being prudent and trying risky new things in other blockchains first, not the world's most valuable blockchain.
Guess what, I thought theDao was a risky idea too, and that investment should be capped at a reasonable amount because they were creating a honeypot for crackers and risking investors funds, many of whom don't really understand software.  Does that makes me look naive too?
@_date: 2017-04-20 05:05:06
sure, I felt the same and can sympathize with that view.  In ideal world, segwit or something equivalent would've been baked in from the start.
Over time however, watching this never-ending debate and numerous takeover attempts I've really come to value how resistant bitcoin is to change.  but that resistance includes change I might agree with, such as segwit.
so instead of getting upset about that, I figure let bitcoin be bitcoin, and we as a community should put our best innovations into a new coin instead.
@_date: 2017-04-20 23:22:46
yes.   any other change is fine.  basically any client can do whatever it likes, so long as it follows consensus rules.
@_date: 2017-04-20 05:07:25

someone asked me:  why is blockchain.info used for HD address discovery by default?
answer:  because their API does not require any registration/token and supports querying multiple addresses at once to determine if each has been used or not.  This is **way** faster and more efficient than sending one request for each address.
If anyone knows another API that meets these requirements, please let me know...

@_date: 2017-04-19 22:26:00
When I say instant, I am referring to lightning transactions which are reported to be instant in the sense that they do not need to wait minutes to settle on the blockchain.
Private means that all coins are fungible, one cannot track ownership of a coin  on the blockchain, nor see amounts.  Further, this must be a property of all transactions, not an "opt-in" feature (ala Dash, Zcash) that severely constrains the size of anonymity set.
I would not look to eth or ltc as models for any of these properties.
more like:  mimblewimble, tumblebit, ringct,  zero knowledge proofs, lightning.

Maybe not, but re-using ANY payment identifier still has a privacy problem.
Let's say you generate one of these fancy new re-usable identifiers and give it out to three exchanges and 3 of your favorite darknet markets, and receive funds from each of those.  You think, hey no problem, it can't be traced on the blockchain.
But you've made a mistake.   At one of the exchanges they already have your identity on file.   ( or maybe not now but a year in the future they freeze your funds and demand ID before releasing them. )  Crap, your real-world ID is linked to that payment address.
Now let's say that one (or more) of these darknet markets gets raided.  Law enforcement has the database and wants to know who received these payments.  They subpoena all the major exchanges for their payment records.
boom.  a match.   All your received payments on the darknets with that payment code are now matched up with the payment code on an exchange which is matched up with a copy of your passport or driver's license.
But payment codes are private right?   right?
moral of the story:  ANY reusable payment identifier will never be completely private because they are tracked outside the blockchain by involved parties.  If you care about privacy, only ever give out brand-new unique addresses.
( btw, monero has exactly this problem because it does not support creating a new address for each customer/payment.  except by creating a new wallet )
Now let me make a cynical prediction: In the misguided interest of *making things simple for users* most wallet software that implement these payment codes will permit only a single payment code per wallet even though there is no technical reason for such a limit.  Thus leading users down the path of being tracked all over the place.

sometimes old and reliable is better than new and shiny.

1. satoshi's per byte, down to 0.
2. fixed fee amount, down to 0.
anything beyond that is gravy.   raw transactions, sure!  bitcoin-core supports them.     :-)
I'm sick of apps that try to "protect users from themselves", only to cause more headaches and in this case even significant monetary losses to users.  The proper development attitude should be "warn, and allow override", not "prohibit, deny, obstruct, and limit".
If you really think about it, a bitcoin wallet is merely an interface to the bitcoin system.  Thus, an ideal interface would facilitate a user to accomplish *anything* that the bitcoin system consensus rules allow.   And if the UI is too limited to accomplish that, then yes it should allow lower level access for advanced users to bypass the limitations.
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:17:43
seems fair to me.    
like I said, I'm sick of apps that artificially restrict people's actions.  It's a development mindset that needs re-thinking.   if a thing is possible with the bitcoin system: warn, and allow.  don't prevent.

Most people don't care that much about how the electrical infrastructure works.  They are just happy to watch TV, use their computer, etc.  But they still benefit from the infrastructure.
It is up to the designers and engineers to care about fundamental things like generating plants, transformers, distribution panels, wiring, poles, safety devices, and on and on.
Fungibility is the same.  It is a critical component of a good money, yet something that 99.999% of people have never really thought about.
It should just be there, and it should "just work".  for everyone, for every transaction. Without some crazy extra steps like mixers that less than 1% of people will ever use.
If it is not there, then the money can still be used, but cracks will begin to show up in the system, and trust/goodwill for the money will be lost as people get burned.

how about we just leave bitcoin the hell alone and focus our energies on other things?
I wish that our community's best and brightest would begin work on a new coin that incorporates many of the advancements that have been proposed eg mimblewimble, bitcoin-ng, schnorr, ct, lightning, etc.  Basically a new cryptocurrency designed from the ground up for modularity, privacy, fungibility, scalability, ease-of-use, mass-market appeal.
As for bitcoin, to me it is most valuable while it demonstrates that it can resist politically motivated change.  So far it is doing that admirably, and I hope it continues.  that means:  no segwit.  no HF.  no SF.   honeybadger status quo prevails.
what about fees and stuck tx you cry.  Well, yeah that situation sucks right now.  I hear that lightning network can be modified to work on status-quo bitcoin.  Just a bit uglier.  So let's do that already.  Or also bitpay claims to have something similar that doesn't require segwit.
Maybe bitcoin won't be the currency for the masses.  Maybe it will be digital gold instead.  Or maybe something technically better will eat its lunch entirely.  I'm ok with that provided that bitcoin demonstrates it is possible to have a digital asset that will not bend and give in to political whims.
Those of you pushing for segwit should consider that if you actually succeed, you are creating a precedent and a path for further manipulations down the road.  For changes you may not agree with.  Do you really want that?

transactions can still be linked together if a change address from TX a is used as an input in TX b.
worse, maybe you did everything right and were totally anonymous for 5 years, but in the 6th year you associate a Tx with your identity, then boom, someone can (maybe) follow the trail.
To my mind, wallets should assist with this by:
 a) having an option to always prefer non-change address over change address. 
 b) having an option to provide an alert/confirm/abort if a given tx is using inputs from a change address.
The above assumes that you never once disclose your identity to anyone you make a tx with.  If even one party knows, all bets are off.

I am keen on this "immutability seal" idea.
Given that anyone can fork software at any time Is such a thing possible?   Do you have ideas on a practical implementation?  I envision some sort of "proof of executing code", but i guess that would require hardware support.  eg perhaps making use of Intel's Trusted Execution Technology.  But it seems even that can be faked, just by running modified hardware, no?
If possible, I think it would be a valuable addition to most every cryptocurrency.  Personally, when/if I invest in an asset, I do not want it's properties changed by *anyone*.  If I did, I would stick with fiat.
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:23:14
yes, and I'm still hopeful that all this segwit stuff will fall through.  But if it doesn't, then my faith will be quite shaken that bitcoin can resist controversial changes and backroom dealings.
So I was thinking that maybe bitcoin needs a little help to retain status quo consensus rules:  in the form of a client that promises never to change them, and a mining pool that runs it.  We would be the stick in the mud that helps bitcoin resist changes when others try.

I beg to differ.
I believe that status quo would be the best outcome, long term, and is also the most likely.
It would demonstrate that at least one cryptocurrency consensus protocol can in fact remain steadfast (immutable) in the face of controversy and strong factions that are trying to change it.
Such a demonstration is, I think, more important than the technical advantages brought about by segwit.  (which I mostly happen to agree with, btw.)
2nd layer solutions can still be built on unmodified bitcoin, eg lightning, rootstock, and whatever bitpay is doing.
Those of us that prefer the status quo don't need to make lots of noise like those of you that are trying to fork bitcoin away into something else.   We just think its entertaining to watch the fireworks and we realize that the more you two camps fight eachother, the more likely status quo will prevail.
Have a nice day, and good luck.
@_date: 2017-05-29 17:18:24
yet your signalling mechanisms do.   anyone can sybil that.   how will you even have any idea whether to proceed or not?   the only halfway decent proposal I have seen for that is to create a prediction market for segwit success, but none has yet to arise...
anyway, uasf is an attack on the current worldwide bitcoin consensus protocol.  You can try to spin it as an upgrade, but that's just wordplay.  I didn't sign up to bitcoin for upgrades.  rather, for immutability and stability.
It's strength lies in resisting such attacks when there is not widespread consensus.

I will have my popcorn ready.  :-)
It is not at all clear to me that uasf or any other change will occur in the face of controversy -- so my position (status quo) may yet win by default.
In a way, I will be disappointed if uasf can/does succeed with only a small majority, because to me that means that cryptocurrency is just a new form of tyranny by the majority and not a digital gold at all.  This really lowers the value proposition for me.
In another way, I would be very happy to have malleability fixed, and a clearer path forward for scaling.  So it sort of cancels out.
I fully agree that ever larger blocks is short-sighted and a bad idea -- tending to centralize and ignoring the real scaling challenges.
@_date: 2017-05-21 01:49:24
I understand the improvements that segwit brings. I wish they had been baked in from the start.  but they weren't.
Given that fact, I think that bitcoin should remain as it is.  frozen.  ossified.  stable.  secure.
Any number of improvements can occur in altcoins.  That is where experimentation should happen.  And bitcoiners can buy the alts at any time.  So all such change is always opt-in.  That way, nobody's investment gets changed from underneath them, without their consent.
All consensus protocol changes entail risk.  There is the risk of a chain split.  There is also new code that could potentially have bugs or expose a new attack surface.
People here are so married to the idea of constant software change and improvement that most seem incapable to grasp the idea that the bottom layer may not need to change.  ever.
If we DO get segwit via UASF (or whatever means), does it end there?   Can we finally call it quits for changing the consensus layer?   My fear is that of the slippery slope... that it will only get easier with precedent.
I believe there is enormous value in demonstrating to the world that a cryptocurrency can actually become a stable, immutable, rock solid, unchanging thing.
Yet both camps of this so-called scaling debate are trying to do the exact opposite, and effect change.
I won't shed a tear if segwit activation does happen.  Again, I understand its usefulness.   But I hope that will be the last consensus layer change, ever.
edit:  and no, I won't be signalling for uasf, or even segwit.  Still running pre-segwit nodes.
edit:  and no, I'm not a miner.  :-)

I would *like* malleability to have been fixed to begin with, but at this point I strongly believe bitcoin consensus rules should *not* be changed.
bitcoin is what it is.  that gives it strength.
bitcoin does not need to change. not now, not ever. not for things that I might like, or that you might like.
if humans could change the properties of gold, it would never have been a stable store of value over thousands of years.  Instead it would be a fiat type of asset, and most likely left on the ash heap of history.
nobody "governs" gold.  nobody upgrades it.   not ever.  nobody decides if we should tweak the atomic weight of gold or the color or hardness or conductivity.  nobody lobbies for these changes on social media.  
gold keeps holding value.
This community should celebrate and rejoice that it is so difficult to change bitcoin. That is what makes it great.
let altcoins innovate, and let bitcoin be bitcoin.
think about it.
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:54:26
yes, I have wrestled with this a bit myself.   I do not believe there is presently a *technical* way to enforce status-quo, but that doesn't mean we have to give up.
as you say, the software itself can be modified / forked.  But the blockchain will only split or suffer a consensus-rules change if enough economic actors run software in favor of such change.
Up to this point, there has not been a strong voice for keeping status quo rules in the bitcoin community, or any cryptocurrency except perhaps eth-classic.
To achieve this, I envision a client ( could be software fork of today's bitcoin ) that makes a promise to its users that the developers of the client will never alter the consensus rules in that client.  We can say that the core ethos of the client and people that run it is to keep the status quo rules.
Next, envision that we create one or more mining pools that run this client.  If we begin to mine blocks with a client named eg: bitcoin-status-quo-forever, then we start to have a real say.  And if our mining pool ever reaches 20% or so, we begin to have some real stopping power.  We become a giant stick in the mud for *anyone* that wants to change consensus rules, for any reason.
But even just the existence of such a client should begin to make it clear to the rest of the community that there are those who value predictability, stability, and security over the alternatives.
anyway, that's what I've concluded.  But am very open to alternative suggestions.
ps:  an easy objection to creating such a client is that the rest of the community can soft or hard-fork the rules anyway, and then the client is obsolete.   That may be true. If a large enough community runs the client during and after the fork, then a true chainsplit may result, as with eth-classic.   This threat may be enough deterrent to prevent a fork in the first place.
If only a small minority runs the client after the fork, they may not have enough economic and hashpower to sustain their fork.  In this case, the developers of the client could choose to:
* abandon their efforts.
* create a new client, conforming to the new consensus rules, but with the same status-quo ethos.  in other words, try, try again.  It is important that this new client have a new name and a new github repo, so that anyone using the older client *not* be upgraded by mistake.

users can't practically reject if 80%+ hashpower goes in a particular direction.
Users could stay on their own chain, yes.   But tx confirmations on that chain would slow to an absolute crawl, perhaps taking days or weeks until the retarget is reached, which could take months.
not really a great option.
that said, I hope that these changes DO get rejected.   :-)

I agree.  Except, how do you define "resist that" when you have two (or more) sides each trying to change bitcoin's consensus rules?
I define them *all* as attacks against bitcoin's consensus rules, and urge that we resist and stick with status quo.
If we don't have that mindset now, I don't know when we ever will... 
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:36:54
ok, I see.  I'm not sure how segwit changes that picture exactly, but doubtless it does.
Anyway, I've asked for clarification about that a few times from people and yours is the only answer I've received that makes it clear why just setting a locktime far in the future would not work equivalently to an indefinite channel.
thanks for taking the time to explain!
@_date: 2017-07-07 06:08:39
It quite clearly does.
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:08:02
the fact that the market can be manipulated due to uncertainty about possible changes demonstrates a fundamental weakness in bitcoin's design, and/or in the mindset of the community.
No one threatens to change the properties of gold.  No one can.  Because of this the value has remained stable over thousands of years.
This community should not be so eager to modify the consensus rules of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:02:17
my nodes are enforcing the only rules they know: the status quo.
@_date: 2016-05-21 20:04:39
that's great!  do they...?
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:12:03
my goal is that, and to the rest of the world also.
But to do that, cryptocurrency needs to prove that at least one single asset can remain stable and secure over the long term.  Changing the consensus rules is not conducive to that.  It introduces politics, infighting, and large market swings.  It creates uncertainty and reduces trust in the system.  It introduces the possibilty of new bugs and attack vectors.
In my opinion, it is far better that bitcoin consensus rules remain as-is, un-changed forever.
Maybe LN or a similar layer 2 solution can be built atop bitcoin, even without segwit.
Or if not, let other more nimble cryptocurrencies take up the mantle of handling transactions for the unbanked.  mimblewimble/grin may be much better suited for this.
So long as it remains true to itself, bitcoin will almost certainly stick around as the longest-lived and most stable crypto.  Or if it is truly not needed anymore someday, then it can go away.
The cryptocurrency space can evolve and grow in evolutionary fashion without individual currencies needing to constantly update and become tyranny of the majority fiefdoms.
think about it.

One suggestion.  The bash argument interface is cumbersome for adding multi-line notes.  It would be nice if it were possible to configure a default editor (eg vi by default) to use when adding or editing entries.  Similar to how git and svn handle comments.
Oh also, I was expecting it to just automatically create the first database someplace like .steel/passwords.sqlite.   Instead, it requires me to specify the path initially.
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:10:40
bitcoin has consensus rules that are enforced by every full node.  those rules define what bitcoin is.  
It's not established yet that gold can keep the top spot as a stable store of value either.  but 2000+ years seems pretty good.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:29:17
I get your point.  It "feels" to many people as though bitcoin has changed for transactional purposes and some may even feel betrayed.
As a computer programmer, I look at the same situation and observe that the 1mb rule did not change during the time frame when most people got involved with bitcoin until now.  Only many people had incomplete understandings of what bitcoin's code actually does, and what the implications of that are under heavier usage.   To such people it may "feel" as if bitcoin changed, and I've heard Roger Ver say things to this effect many times and blame the core team but it always bugs me because, no, factually the 1mb limit did not change since the time satoshi implemented it.
It is true that there have been other changes to the consensus rules during that time as you point out.   I myself am a purist and have consistently been arguing against all such changes for months.  For me, the quicker bitcoin's rules ossify and become completely unchangeable, the better.  Bitcoin can then remain a stable, predictable asset and innovation can occur on altcoins with new chains.
This is not a widely held view at this time, but I feel it is a logically consistent one.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:36:25
no, status quo are the present-day consensus rules that everyone running a validating node already agreed to.
anything else is an attack, in this case a likely successful 51% attack to change the rules.  Just because a majority agrees with it doesn't make it any less of an attack to the minority.
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:02:46
false dichotomy.  bitcoin does not need to change.
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:26:36
they are the rules (logic) codified in the consensus layer of the bitcoin-core reference client, and any other full-node clients such as btcd.
Sadly, there is no official written specification.  This is in fact a major shortcoming, imho.
It could probably be a great phd paper for somebody to actually formalize the existing rules into such a document.
@_date: 2017-07-19 18:10:43
There is a happy (safest) path where the status-quo consensus rules continue to operate and bitcoin shakes off all these attempts to change it.

@_date: 2017-07-12 00:35:55


Then you should have nothing to worry about!  Seemingly everything must already be correct and will remain so.


Developers may make any changes they wish.  It is up to the community to adopt them or not.  But in the case of the core developers, the default option of most in the community is to eventually upgrade to latest software and thus the changes become active.  In a way users are on an upgrade treadmill without a real choice.    So what I am proposing to do is invert this:  make a client whereby users can explicitly indicate they do not want change.  Updating to latest version of that software will always give the latest features available and bugfixes available but not any consensus rule changes.


That's fine.  I just don't believe that a community movement will get very far without some code that community members can actually run.  anything else is just talk.


that's fine... but not really something I personally would support at this time.
To me that position is incompatible with being a yardstick by which other currencies are measured.   Generally speaking, yardsticks do not change.  that's kind of the point.
Remember also that:
* client changes can still be made so long as they do not affect consensus layer.
* consensus layer changes and huge innovations can be made with a new genesis block, ie altcoin.


hmm, I don't understand this statement in the context of the discussion.
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:57:56
dunno.   But I do know that if bitcoin consensus rules keep changing by  majority vote and political machinations it will never be a good long term store of value.  I fear these so called upgrades are throwing the baby out with the bath water.

@_date: 2017-07-07 04:38:17
and yet bitcoin remains the most valuable crypto asset.
Even if another asset should overtake bitcoin, that is no reason to change it. 
In fact, changing its core properties without overwhelming consensus will likely devalue *all* cryptocurrencies because it would demonstrate to the world that even the oldest and most widely held crypto can be transmuted by  political maneuverings.
If the physical properties of gold could be manipulated by humans in this fashion then gold would not have been a stable store of value over thousands of years.
people in this community should embrace and celebrate how difficult it is to change bitcoin.  Our motto should be "like a rock" because we stand firm against change.
to your point, people will always value an asset that cannot be manipulated.  high fees or not.   high fees are in fact a sign that people value it very much indeed.
LN or another scaling solution can be built on top of bitcoin AS-IS, without segwit.  Or if not, too bad.  another coin can do it.  let bitcoin just be bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:31:23
fair enough.   It's just an idea I've been toying with for a while.
My view is that any consensus layer change to any cryptocurrency is an immoral act unless (a) 100% consensus is achieved amongst all holders of that currency, or (b) unless they have each somehow explicitly agreed that they will accept changes by majority [hash/fork] decision.
Personally, I would never agree to (b) but many would I suppose.
Anyway, I think that all consensus layer upgrades should be done along with a new genesis block.  Thus, the upgrade is always opt in and the market can choose.   Essentially, this is what alt-coins do.
I figured that if I ever created an alt-coin, I would make this principle clear from the start, so that early members of the community would embrace it and it would become a founding ethos.
Bringing things back to bitcoin, I've come to realize that such an ethos can be formed around a particular bitcoin client, and the very act of running that client empowers the individuals to have a say.
Without such a client, individuals have the following choices:
* run an ancient bitcoin-core 0.13.0 or before without segwit and other recent features.
* run a recent bitcoin-core and thereby signal support for segwit.
* run BU, segwit2x, or bip148 clients, all of which signal support for change.
So the only way to signal support for "no change" is hobble oneself with an old client that is slower and less performant than recent releases.
And there isn't any organization or community that is promoting that people do this either.  Though that is a possibility/option we could consider.
So what I am attempting to do in my earlier posts is to outline a method whereby likeminded people can have an up-to-date bitcoin-core client, but one that actively signals it will never change the present consensus rules.  
It is not an attempt to relabel bitcoin, only a way for likeminded people to come together and also begin to have a voice in this debate.  If you think about it, the OROC client would be just like any other bitcoin client that follows the rules of bitcoin.  Only it wouldn't go along if the rest decide to stray.
@_date: 2017-07-14 17:04:25

@_date: 2017-07-20 19:21:12
hey thanks for your support.  If you read my post history, you'll find various arguments I make for keeping the status quo rules.
unfortunately, according to the core devs, there are risks for anyone that keeps running the pre-segwit clients after segwit is activated.
see:  
if segwit does activate, I hope it will be the last consensus rule change.
@_date: 2017-07-19 08:08:17
yeah i've been trying to spread the word, but it mostly seems to fall on deaf ears around here.   People are so accustomed to regular software upgrades that it is cognitive dissonance for most to understand that bitcoin is powerful because it has potential to be stable and resistant to change over the long term.
I've been thinking about writing up an article making the case for status quo.  If a community were to form around these ideas, we could release a bitcoin client (software fork) with a promise to our users that the devs will never modify the consensus rules except in case of a security issue/bug.   A next step would be to create a mining pool that uses this software.  
At that point, the "status quo" community could begin to make our voices heard in a way that really counts.   Even a relatively small mining community can have an outsize effect when it comes to blocking changes.
I think the very existence of a client with such an ethos should also help change the conversation when bitcoin-core or any other client proposes changes.  
The same idea can actually apply to any cryptocurrency.  The eth-classic guys get it already.  Monero seems to need encouragement in this area.

1. segwit hasn't activated yet.   I'll believe it when I see it.
2. Yes bitcoin's un-governability is perhaps its most important property.  *any* change to consensus rules undermines that and makes bitcoin less stable and predictable, including segwit.  It appears this community has allowed itself to be swayed instead of standing firm.
what we have just seen is a [probably] successful attack on bitcoin's consensus rules, performed by political maneuverings, backroom deals, and propoganda campaigns.  I, for one, do not agree with this change, or any change.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:34:17
thanks.    yeah I'm certainly not on board with that camp.
Edit: I've been saying similar things for months now as evidenced on my post history.  But I'm kind of a voice in the wilderness thus far.   I feel that someone should stick up for the status quo.   Though the nice thing is that the status quo will likely win out even without having a strong contingent because the design of bitcoin makes it very resistant to any controversial changes.  I think eventually that the community will come to realize and appreciate this after banging their heads against the wall for years to no avail.    only time will tell....

@_date: 2017-07-11 02:06:30
Perhaps I should amend this statement.
I wish to see cryptocurrency succeed, and this means that I wish to see a superior form of money emerge:  one that is private, fungible, and yes scalable.
However, I think that for people to trust cryptocurrency it is also necessary to demonstrate that crypto can be stable and predictable over the long term.  Bitcoin, as the oldest and the largest cryptocurrency is in the best position to do this.  Any changes to it's consensus rules undermine this goal.
As a stable, unchanging asset, bitcoin will also serve as a yardstick by which all other currencies may be measured, both fiat and crypto.
Yes, other cryptos may emerge with superior properties and may become much more widely used for daily transactions.  However, I think bitcoin will retain its value and some high value transactions would still settle to btc blockchain, eg transfers between banks, exchanges, etc.
If bitcoin dies, it is because another technology is so clearly superior in every way that bitcoin is not needed at all.  In this case, present day holders of bitcoin will have opportunities to transfer their holdings over to the newer assets.   Each individual can make this choice in their own time.
There is no need to force change upon anyone.

re JoinMarket, it is a clever solution and I'm glad it exists and that people are using it and some even profiting from it.
So the below is not meant to be negative about joinmarket, but really just indicates we need a privacy solution BAKED-IN to bitcoin.
Some drawbacks that I see:
1) It is still an opt-in system.  Privacy tech works best when everyone uses it by default.  for example, end users don't have to opt-in to use SSL. 
2) because it is opt-in, much/most of the funds may be "dirty". Unlike if the entire bitcoin economy used it by default, then most funds would be "clean", at least in terms of the immediately previous tx(s).
3) Because much of the funds are "dirty", this creates a disincentive for those holding "clean" funds to mix their funds with the "dirty".  IE to willingingly bring "dirty" funds into their wallet in place of "clean".  JM compensates for this by rewarding those who provide liquidity, but for some that reward will never be enough.

as I see it, you uasf people are attacking bitcoin.   just sayin... 
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:32:53
there was no change in bitcoin to cause those things.
just because you did not previously understand the implications of bitcoin's properties with full blocks does not mean that somehow bitcoin "*changed* like this on me".   only bitcoin's *usage* has changed.
the analogy works because consensus rules are bitcoin's intrinsic/innate properties, just as gold has intrinsic/innate properties that no one can just wish away.
and by the way, it has gotten harder to find gold in the earth, and gold is no longer coined or accepted as money in most countries.  Does that mean that gold has changed on you/us?  of course not, only usage has changed.
@_date: 2017-07-02 07:05:35
arguably *any* change to the bitcoin protocol is an attack on "Bitcoin" as it presently exists.  including uasf, masf, any form of segwit.

My vision of the future for bitcoin is that it proves that a cryptocurrency can be a long-term stable and predictable asset with no serious security flaws, that is not subject to the whims of men, or tyranny of the majority.


most?  no.  though doubtless some would.   ideally all money would be replaced by cryptocurrency (not necessarily bitcoin) at some point.


I do not propose to achieve any goal other than bitcoin continuing to exist and being itself... ie sticking to the consensus rules already agreed upon.
bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum.  other projects can introduce scaling innovations, and people can trade freely between them.


Privacy and fungibility are things I care about deeply.   Fortunately other projects are taking on that mantle.  The best thing that bitcoin can do is prove that cryptocurrency cannot be "governed" and politically manipulated.   Changes to the consensus rules that get activated are prima facie evidence of manipulation.
The sooner we get to a fully ossified, static bitcoin (ala ipv4) the better.
See also discussions of John Nash's Ideal Money, as related to bitcoin.  The idea here is that a stable bitcoin could be used as a yardstick whereby to measure fiat currencies and ultimately force them to behave and asymptotically approach "ideal money".
Don't get me wrong:  I love privacy, fungibility, scalability, atomic swaps, etc, etc.  I just think there are other ways to get them that do not involve changing the aircraft's design mid-flight with 300 passengers on board.
Let me ask you some questions:
1) At what point are bitcoin's consensus rules "good enough"?
2) what makes you think that only rule changes you like will be adopted, and not those you disagree with?
3) Do you not agree that each rule change sets a precedent for another one?
4) at what point would you take a stand to stop changing bitcoin's rules?
5) Do you care about the minority's problems/losses/grievances when the majority decides to change the rules over minority's objections?
6) Would you agree that the possibility of consensus rule change introduces doubt about bitcoin's future and causes market turmoil?
7) Which do you think has a higher attack surface and possibility that a serious vulnerability will be found:  today's status-quo bitcoin code which has already been tested for years in production, bitcoin with segwit activated,  or a generation of bitcoin several soft-forks down the road?
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:29:58
I meant segwit.   ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-07 14:51:17
*yawn*.   nothing will happen.   bitcoin will keep on being bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-06 00:07:49
I don't wish to see bitcoin fragmented, but I would absolutely love to see the top minds in bitcoin working on a new cryptocurrency built from ground up with privacy, scalability, modularity, provable correctness, and usability in mind.   I've been saying this for a while actually.
I guess grin/mimblewimble is the closest thing to this now.
I'm curious if there have been any discussions of the core team or some subset thereof about developing a new codebase from scratch.... 


Frankly, I would prefer to see bitcoin remain exactly as-is.   status quo.  immutable.  core team could do some maintenance and bugfixes, but put majority of effort into a truly next-gen system.  clean room.  blue sky...
eventually, the market will sort out where the value is.  no need for political debates to change something that ought not be changed.   nobody debates about how to change the physical properties of gold.
if majority rule *could* change gold's properties, it would not have remained a stable store of value over thousands of years.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:10:45
I do not want segwit for the simple reason that I oppose all changes to the status quo consensus rules.
(excepting of course if a serious exploit is ever found.)

@_date: 2017-07-07 23:16:57
it is not stalling to simply recognize what bitcoin is and how it resists controversial changes by its very nature, by design.
the two sides of this debate may not like to hear it, but there is a third way.  And that way is:  no change.   bitcoin rules stay exactly as they are.
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:11:12


Why would you want to?
When people ask this question, I think to myself that they do not understand the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:04:28
fair point.
I hope that the cryptocurrency community can develop enough great tech to eventually launch a coin that is private (enough) and scalable (enough) and distributed (enough) to resist consensus-rule changes.   That would change the world.
So far bitcoin is pretty much failing in all three categories:  privacy, scalability, and stability.
That makes me sad.
@_date: 2017-07-12 03:01:21
The malleability issue only applies before the first confirmation, and a transaction cannot in any way be considered "settled" before then anyway.

yes more than 2 will surely be required.   again, I think a code release announcement can help serve as a seed for that, but there must be some people to run it also, so better if they are asking for it already.
I've already begun reviewing bitcoin-core code.  I do not promise or commit to release anything, but may do so if I can find the time.  I have previously made some (private) mods to bitcoin-core, so am moderately familiar with the process.
I haven't done it yet, but I will likely post on the bitcoin-dev list to ask for *technical* advice on how best to disable segwit for my own node.  It's possible that may prompt a little further awareness/discussion, though I will endeavor to make it only a technical question and not advance any sort of cause.
anyway, if you review my post history for the past couple months you can find some people that have agreed with me on these topics.   contacting some of them could be a start.   I was hoping some would join in this thread, but doesn't seem so yet.
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:42:09
and it was looking very unlikely to happen until a few people met in a room in New York, and suddenly the fix was in.
If that doesn't shake one's confidence in a supposedly decentralized and distributed system, I don't know what would.
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:13:00
I in fact like most/much of what segwit does. 
But I do not support it, as I do not support any change.
If segwit were baked in from the start, then great.  but it wasn't and an economy has built up around bitcoin as it presently is.
let innovation occur in alts.  let bitcoin be bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-07-10 19:58:14
sure, aug 1 is a date to watch.  If a fork occurs, then clearly bitcoin is not there yet, and in fact might never get there.  That would shake things up and cast doubt upon the entire cryptocurrency experiment.
a succesful change of the consensus rules would clearly indicate that bitcoin is not yet ossified and resistant to change.  It would also mean that controversial changes can happen, which sets a very scary precedent, and should again cast doubt about this entire space.
Exactly what good is a currency that (a) can be split in two from time to time or (b) can be changed out from under those that hold it?
my crystal ball says that aug 1 will pass by with a yawn and status quo will keep on keeping on.
thus far we have a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing.    ;-)
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:10:30
I support status quo.  A quick review of my post history will reveal that I've been arguing for it for months.  My arguments include other rationale besides nash-ian monetary policy.  One-liner points include:
* gold would not have remained stable over millenia if humans could change its innate properties.  We would have screwed it up.
* consensus layer change introduces moral hazard
* changing consensus rules shifts the behavior for everybody including those that do not want the change.
* bitcoin without change proves cryptocurrency can be stable/steady.
* markets love stability and predictability
* an unchanging bitcoin provides a yardstick by which to measure other currencies (fiat and crypto).   the nashian argument.
* innovation can occur in altcoins.
* bitcoin resists controversial changes anyway. fighting it is to fight bitcoin's nature/design.
* if altcoins with superior monetary properties arise then people can opt into them individually without forcing anyone else to do so.  This is a morally superior way to "upgrade".
I do think it is perhaps time that those of us that care about bitcoin's ability to resist change, especially controversial change, should perhaps name that property and also give ourselves a name/label to show others that there is a third path and they have been caught up in a false dichotomy.
I think that a good name for this ethos would reflect bitcoin's steadfast nature against opposing forces.  I think of a giant boulder in the ocean, resisting the waves and tides for millennia.
Some words and phrases I can think of that might be relevant are:
* immutable / immutability.
* steadfast (ness)
* status quo
* like a rock
* steady as a rock
* enduring
* ossified.
**Immutable** is good, but is often used in cryptocurrency to describe the block-chain, not the consensus rules.  The thesaurus lists the following synonyms for immutable:


Personally, I think that **ossified** is a good choice.   It brings to mind an image of rock or bone that has hardened and resists further change.
The dictionary gives these definitions:








"the old political institutions have ossified"
Further Andreas has long been talking about how the ipv4 has ossified and can no longer be changed because it is so widespread and decentralized.  So this word already has some mindshare for exactly this usage/meaning.
That is my vision for bitcoin.  That it is (hopefully) too widespread and decentralized for the consensus layer to be changed significantly.  Or at least that the sooner it gets there the better.
Ok, so with the above laid as groundwork, let's play with some phrases:
* Ossified Rules of Consensus ( OROC )
* Bitcoin Ossification Movement.  ( BOM )
* Bitcoin Ossified.  ( BO )    too close to body odor!
* Ossified Bitcoin.  (OB)    confusion with open bazarre.
* Movement to Ossify Bitcoin  ( MOB )
* Ossified Rules Bitcoin (ORB)
* Bitcoin Rules Ossified (BRO)      bro, kinda funny.
Of all these, I think I like the best:
 Ossified Rules of Consensus.
"OROC Bitcoin"  precedes bitcoin with the sound of "rock", which reinforces the "like a rock" idea.
If we get really serious, one thing we could do is to fork bitcoin-core and release an OROC Bitcoin client without segwit, or with segwit code disabled.   In this way, people could actively participate in this community by running the OROC client and signaling their desire to resist all consensus layer changes.  The idea for this client would be to keep up to date with bitcoin-core as much as possible without the possibility that segwit or other soft or hard-forks will ever activate in our client.  ( unless a critical bug/flaw is discovered. )
So I ask everyone reading this two things:
1. Do you agree with the name *Ossified Rules of Consensus (OROC)* or do you have another proposal?
2. Would you run an OROC client if it were released?

status quo FTW.   :-)
@_date: 2017-07-12 04:47:49
My understanding based on statements from nullc and others is that LN is indeed possible on status-quo bitcoin, but would not support payment channels that can stay open indefinitely.   If this is inaccurate or incomplete, I'd be somewhat curious to find out why.
anyway, my viewpoint is that many many things would be *nice* but that stability and security trump such wishes.   innovation can and should occur in alts.  There is also the moral hazard of changing the rules of the game out from under those who already invested with a given set of rules.

I just installed the latest version from git, and evaluated a bit.  conclusion:  not quite ready for my use yet.
for the moment a simple text editor and encrypted file suits my needs.  with some/most of the changes below in place, I'd seriously consider switching.
These comments are intended to be constructive, not critical.
my thoughts / notes / wishlist:
1) init/open/close is complex, not needed, and users (eg me) will forget to close probably losing or corrupting data.  all three commands should be removed.  Instead:
* the app should default to known location eg ~/.steel.db
* steel --add should open, read/modify, close the presently selected DB every operation.
2) --list-all or other commands that access the db should also open/close as necessary, and prompt for password when opening.
3) steel --switch or something like that could be used to switch to an alternate db location, for subsequent commands.  ( stored in ~/.steel.config )  will init new DB if not present.
4) it would be handy to have a --storepass option.  This would be a bit like open, but it would only the store the password in shared mem, so it is not necessary to specify for future operations.  obviously this is not as secure. You could possibly look to gpg-agent for inspiration.
5) Interactive mode is nice, but still forces user into a particular order and also requires entering password twice.  multi-line notes cannot be formatted/edited easily.  so.... opening a text editor (ala git) with a template file is the way I would want to use it... freeform and with my editor shortcuts, etc.
6) interactive mode should prompt "Add another?"
7) list-all is nice.  Another feature could be --edit and --edit-all, that would bring up all passwords in a text file in user's favorite editor.  This would enable free-form editing.  --edit -i would be an interactive edit.
8) add search.  steel --search &lt;str&gt; would search all fields, including pass.  steel --search &lt;str&gt; --field=title would search only title field.  etc.
@_date: 2017-07-07 04:42:36
2FA should always be opt-in.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:55:05
hey, I'm with you.  or at least I've been down that road also.
I would simply submit for your consideration the notion that bitcoin does not have to be the end-all, be-all cryptocurrency.  Rather, we can take what we've learned from bitcoin and create new and better designs.  mimblewimble/grin shows promise in this area, and even monero has superior privacy.
I argue that the main strength of a cryptocurrency is censorship resistance and immutability, and *hopefully* stability as a long term store of value.  In my view, bitcoin can best retain these qualities by sticking with status-quo rules and avoiding all change, whether we might agree with them or not.
If you are interested in more reasoning about this, please have a look at my post history, as I've been advancing various arguments for status-quo rules for a few months now.
I figure somebody ought to stand up for today's bitcoin.  :-)

so barry silbert was there mining when everyone else forked?     oh no, that's right... he wasn't.  principled and stubborn miners were.  you don't know who you're talking to.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:59:31
agree to disagree.
the nice thing for my viewpoint is that when there is disagreement in bitcoin, typically consensus rules remain in force with no change.
in other words, status quo prevails without overwhelming consensus otherwise.
@_date: 2017-07-30 06:18:05
also, a large percentage of many alts (cough: eth, cough cough ripple) are locked up in pre-mines or similar and not available to public.  So only a small percentage is trading which inflates the alts price beyond what it would otherwise be.  Yet coinmarketcap and others (by default) compute marketcap based on total coins in existence instead of tradeable coins.   This distorts the market and is something not everyone is aware of.   imagine if a recipient of the pre-mine started dumping those coins...
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:53:41

Well, I agree that the patent is bad.   I am philosophically against all patents in general, and software patents in particular.  I see no moral or ethical problem with circumventing or ignoring one, only a possible legal problem depending on one's jurisdiction.
But anyway, that is a legal problem, not a technology problem.
I haven't looked into asicboost enough to know if it must be implemented in hardware or not.  I think it can be done completely in software.   Thus, it seems to me that an anon group or individual could easily release code for it for any manufacturer's device.  Likely that is what will happen, if it hasn't already.

you are likely correct.
I am simply here to voice that some of us resist *any* change to the consensus rules, even those we might otherwise approve of.
@_date: 2017-07-07 18:31:20
I agree with Andreas, but I take a harder stance.
Bitcoin is already widespread.  Therefore, any change to bitcoin consensus rules is a BAD change.
if bitcoin can be changed at will, then it is being governed. even if it is the majority's will.
governance = fiat.
tyranny of the majority is still tyranny.
Gold has kept its value over thousands of years precisely because humans have not been able to change its physical properties.
Bitcoin is the closest mankind has yet come to creating an asset with gold's immutability. That achievement should be celebrated, not constantly railed against.
immutability, scarcity and human desire to own it make an asset strong and stable. not scalability or anything else.
another crypto can implement scalability tech. bitcoin does not need to change.
most people in this community are caught up in a false dichotomy: much like republicans and democrats.
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:32:33
I used to feel as you do, but the more I thought about it, the more comfortable I became with the notion that all such innovation can occur in alts, and the most important thing is for bitcoin to remain stable, predictable, secure.
Roll the idea around in your head a little.... you might find yourself adjusting to it.
@_date: 2017-07-20 03:01:44
hopefully not.   
It would mean that bitcoin is not very resistant to controversial changes, and is ultimately unlikely to be a good long term store of value, as it can be manipulated by political maneuverings and majority whim.
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:46:54
I truly wish bitcoin to keep true to its core value proposition of being resistant to consensus rule changes.
status quo FTW!


@_date: 2017-05-29 17:21:22
tyranny of the majority is a dangerous way to govern.

etc became a thing exactly because SOME miners stuck to their principles (ideology) rather than follow the herd, and did so despite it being a long shot and likely a waste of time/resources/money if not enough others did the same.
the rest of the community was doing their best to make it sound as if the original eth chain would just die after the fork because the new one had such support.
lesson learned i hope
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:34:43


"picking a side" is conformist thinking.  like republicans and democrats.

any change to bitcoin consensus rules sets a bad precedent, is messy, and undermines bitcoin's core value proposition.

The best thing would be regular security audit by independent 3rd party experts.  Regular users could pay an auditer.   Or the author could.
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:43:29
that may well be.
though the minority forks will most certainly need to also modify the mining difficulty adjustment as it would be very slow and expensive mining for them.
imho, anyone that believe they truly have better technology should start their own chain with a new genesis block.   there is no moral hazard with that approach.

Perhaps, but from my perspective it is not.   ;-)
@_date: 2016-07-22 18:38:58
absolutely, I don't use them and never have.  hopefully enough people will withdraw their support that Coinbase will shrink until it either learns better or disappears.
It's just sad to me to see people getting screwed over by them over and over again:  funds frozen, documentation demands, exchange rate screwing, etc, etc.   And with every new injustice, somebody here makes the claim that "Coinbase has no choice, don't blame them.  Blame the system."   Well sorry, you makes your bed and you lie in it.  Coinbase has made choices all along that have led to this point.  Others have made different choices and I support and promote their projects.
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:23:38
if they did not exist in today's bitcoin and were proposed today, I would oppose them.   modifications can occur in altcoins.   the world needs at least one long term *stable* cryptocurrency that can resist all consensus rule changes and best if that crypto has the most proof of work.
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:37:24


At the time I was pretty new to bitcoin and hadn't thought it through enough to be unhappy with it, though I did find it unsettling that a supposedly long-term store of value was somehow changing its rules.  If it were proposed today, I would oppose adding it to bitcoin.
In my view, each blockchain should be inviolate.  This is the only moral path, unless the blockchain creators make it crystal clear to investors up-front that the rules will change underneath them, ie anything goes.  It is also the safest path from a security perspective. 


I don't have any problem with segwit as a technology.  I simply argue that all consensus rule changes should be made with a new genesis block.   And anyway, I doubt segwit alone is sufficient.   Instead, the crypto-space needs some blue-sky thinking and ground-up re-architecture.   mimblewimble and bitcoin-ng are promising examples of this.
Sticking to bitcoin's status quo consensus rules in no way prevents superior technology from being developed and released.


digital gold would be amazing.  First, this industry would have to prove that we can have a long-term stable asset.  Bitcoin has been our best hope of that, but by changing the rules of the game periodically we fall far, far, far short.  This creates political machinations, uncertainty, market turmoil, discussion of "governance", etc.   Nobody ever talks of "governing" gold or changing its properties, because that is silly.   
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:13:40


It's not really a simple majority that can change it, as such could mean forking and causing chaos, possibly losing value.  So far the incentives have prevented any changes that were not approved by overwhelming majority, ie more than 90%.   The more widely used and decentralized bitcoin becomes, the harder and harder it will be to change it.   The term for this is "ossified".  ipv4 is considered to be in this state.  Basically too entrenched to change.  Time will tell if bitcoin is there yet or not.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:24:17
yes, I understand where the group think here is coming from.  I just don't subscribe to it.
if you are interested in my views on the topic, check my post history for past 1-2 months, and you will find many many arguments I have made for keeping the status quo.

All value is subjective.
@_date: 2017-07-15 04:48:04
I must have an ounce of cypherpunk and/or anarchist in me, as I agree with Jeff that upgrade consensus rules by default is bad.
I think all consensus rule changes should be manually opt-in, which of course means they pretty much would never happen, which is imho the best outcome.
I don't support segwit2x either for the record.
I do support code forks, but only in conjuction with a new genesis block, as that is truly an opt-in fork, with no risk to holders of the original chain and no coerced changes, as occurs with both soft and hard-forks.
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:54:38


It's fundamentally different because I can upgrade my modem without upgrading everyone else's, and also the upgrade of a modem does not affect the stability of everyone else's investment.


I genuinely want to see bitcoin succeed, but I think the best way to do that is to continue on as-is, and provide proof to the world that a cryptocurrency can successfully resist controversial changes and can become and remain a stable store of value.  No changes are required for this goal.  Admittedly your goals for bitcoin may differ from mine.
I do not wish to see altcoins take over, though if one is created with clearly superior monetary properties then I am ok with that.  Today the only thing I see with a real chance at that is mimblewimble/grin, which is in early development.  Anyway, I believe that bitcoin will always have value so long as it resists change.  The path is laid.  All we have to do is not screw it up.




I am aware that this is what most people here think.  I simply disagree.  Bitcoin is a scarce resource and (so-far) valuable resource.  It's greatest achievement is that no single entity can inflate or otherwise change it, despite being digital.  This makes it stable and predictable long term, something that markets love.  That property should be celebrated not railed against.  Time will tell who is right.

I will expand on this idea of an OROC client a little bit.
The OROC Bitcoin developer(s) would promise to the community that they will never change the consensus rules except in case of serious flaw/bug.
In this manner a bitcoin sub-community can begin to form with that principle as their primary objective.  Such a community, even if small could be very influential in terms of blocking further consensus layer changes.   Think for example if even one moderately sized mining pool were to run this client.  And if none of them choose to, then it is an opportunity for a new mining pool that can quickly gain the support of miners that support this goal.
As we have seen, there is no end to the proposals to change bitcoin rules.   XT, Segwit, BU, Bip148, Segwit2x.   As each one fails, another is quickly spawned.
Thus far, status quo has prevailed in the face of controversial changes, but that is not always guaranteed.  Those who seek change are coming up with clever tricks.  Perhaps it is time that we give status quo some help with an OROC client.
@_date: 2017-07-22 06:49:13
fair enough.   if segwit is adopted and we get no more rules changes after that, I can live with it.    But I do think that this community needs a stronger voice for "leave well enough alone".... and by that I really mean a mining pool that runs a client with a strong promise that it will. not. alter. consensus. rules.
@_date: 2017-07-07 23:22:41
fair enough.  I was wondering when someone would make such reference.
Even still, that is sort of the equivalent of forking.  and it only applies to limited quantities held by the chemist.  the remainer of gold held worldwide has retained its properties and value.
What people here are trying to do with bitcoin is like changing the physical properties of all gold held worldwide to suit the purposes of some at the expense of others.
@_date: 2017-07-07 04:22:25
yes it is a vote for exactly that.
fortunately, votes don't really count in bitcoin.
the more division and contention there is, the less likely there will be any change to consensus rules.
thus status quo should prevail come aug 1.

It seems that getting anything done in this arena would be an exhausting uphill battle in bitcoin-core, unless possibly it comes from an already well respected dev.  sad because I do think its better to have it there than in a third party util.
@_date: 2017-07-12 02:47:43


great, yeah so we are in sync after all.


hmm, I view it a little differently and I will point out a distinction for your consideration.   The bitcoin network presently operates by a set of rules that are distributed and executing on computers worldwide.  A large number of bitcoin holders (not all) obtained their bitcoins with these rules already in place.  In essence, these are/were "the rules of the game" that (most) all have implicitly agreed to, by investing in bitcoin.   To me it follows then that anyone who tries to change these rules without the consent of all bitcoin holders would be the one that is attempting to "hijack, coupe, or usurp", be they developers or end-users.
By contrast, creating or running a client with an ethos to never change the consensus rules is a way to defend against those who would hijack, coupe, or usurp.


Yes.  so I propose to release a client that is feature-for-feature the same as core, *except* if that means a change to consensus rules.
There is a saying "be the change you want to see in the world".   I think it applies here.
Further, consider that core is comprised of software *developers*.  The habit and nature of software developers is to constantly upgrade/change/improve.  Most are simply not used to "preserve, polish, protect".  So anyone advocating for freezing the consensus layer is essentially attacking lifelong professional habits of the core developers and will be unlikely to change minds.
It is far easier to release a (very slightly) modified client and let users run it for themselves if they so choose.


You and I are aware.   I can release code.   Others can run it if they want.  I believe that is all that is necessary.

I have thought about this quite a bit.
Fractional Reserve banking is not immoral so long as the depositor understands and agrees that their funds will be lent out again and it is a real risk that they might not get paid back.  It is a type of investment.
It absolutely is immoral and should be illegal when the depositor is unaware.
Also, it is immoral to "bail out" depositors aka investors aka creditors by printing new money to cover their losses, at the expense of everyone else using a given currency.
tl;dr.  Fractional Reserve banking is only ethical when all risks are disclosed and it is impossible to bailout depositors by printing new money.

There is a CLI tool people can use themselves privately if they prefer.
Or they can input a list of bitcoin addresses directly instead of xpub.  In fact, that is the default mode of operation.
Unfortunately most wallets do not provide a way to export all used addresses, which is needed for auditing.  But most do provide a way to export master xpub.
Even bitcoin-core makes exporting a full list (including change addresses) needlessly complex.  There is no UI for it, and the RPC call is unintuitively named for the purpose. Here is what I found works:

1) If you are using coinbase without storing your own keys, you do not actually have any bitcoin.  full stop.
2) how hard is it to write down 12 words, make a copy, and store in a safe or fireproof box?  or if you're feeling paranoid, store multiple copies, torn in two.
quite frankly, you sound lazy to me.   Using coinbase is equivalent to using a bank.  ie, its the model that bitcoin was created to obsolete.
@_date: 2017-07-21 15:30:47
fair point.   And I agree with you on some levels.  For sure the price is driven largely by future speculation.
At the same time, there is an argument to be made that the hardest and most important thing for the cryptocurrency industry to prove is that a long-lived stable secure cryptocurrency can actually exist.   Bitcoin, as the oldest and most widespread is in the best position to do that.   By frequently soft-forking, we actually harm the stability and possibly the security (as the code attack surface increases and possibility of new bugs).
I am not actually a bitcoin maximalist or in any way "too attached".  I think the best thing for the space would be for:   1) bitcoin to remain the same, unchanged. stable, secure, predictable.   a digital gold standard if you will.    2) Take the lessons learned and build new coin(s) from ground up with improved designs.   mimblewimble/grin is such an effort.
I think that most here are "too attached" due to their financial investments in bitcoin, and so wish to see bitcoin "win".  This blinds them to the real value of what has already been achieved.  I am afraid the baby may get thrown out with the bathwater in the rush to "upgrade".

Also, while making a tool to derive addresses that match bitcoin-core's implementation, I specifically had to use *m/0'/0'/k'*, and NOT *m/0'/0'/k*, else the generated addresses would not match.

This is part of a much larger discussion about what we should value in a cryptocurrency... ie software that is intended to represent long term assets.

In 50 years, I expect I will still be able to trade in a gold or silver coin I am holding.   Will the same be true for bitcoin stored in an address created in 2010 or 2018?

This is super important.  LN must have privacy by default to ensure fungibility of funds, and ultimately bitcoin's long-term value.
I'll quote the intro and conclusion, for those too lazy to click the link.
ABSTRACT: 
Bitcoin  owes  it  success  to  the  fact  that  transactions  are  transparently  recorded  in  the
blockchain, a global public ledger that removes the need for trusted parties.  While Bitcoin has achieved remarkable success, recording every transaction in the blockchain causes privacy, latency, and scalability issues.  Building on recent proposals for \micropayment channels" | two party associations that use the ledger only for dispute resolution | we introduce techniques
for constructing anonymous payment channels.  Our proposals allow for secure, instantaneous
and private payments that substantially reduce the storage burden on the payment network.
Specifically, we introduce three channel proposals, including a technique that allows payments
via an untrusted intermediary.  Most importantly, each of our proposals can be instantiated
effciently using well-studied techniques.
Bitcoin has become increasingly popular as a decentralized electronic currency.  In Bitcoin, each
transaction  is  recorded  in  the blockchain,  a  public  transaction  ledger  maintained  by  a  set  of
decentralized peers.  While this design has proven successful at low transaction volumes, the reliance
on  a  globally-shared  ledger  has  raised  serious  concerns  about  scalability.   Since  in  Bitcoin  one
megabyte blocks area added to the blockchain every ten minutes on average, the Bitcoin transaction
rate is limited to fewer than ten new transactions per second across the entire Bitcoin user base.
Several proposals to increase blockchain bandwidth are being debated in the Bitcoin community
today [blo16], but none are likely to produce a transaction rate that competes with centralized
services such as payment card networks.
A promising approach to the addressing the scaling problem is to move the bulk of Bitcoin transactions
off chain, while preserving the system's decentralized structure and strong integrity guarantees.  The leading proposal for off-chain payments is to use payment channels , exemplified by the Lightning Network and Duplex Micropayment Channels.  Rather than posting
individual payment transactions to the blockchain, channels employ the blockchain to first establish
a shared deposit between two parties.  The parties interact directly to make payments adjusting
the respective ownership shares of the deposit and communicate with the blockchain only to close
channels or to resolve disputes between the parties.  In cases where no direct payment channel exists between two parties, these proposals also allow participants to route transactions via intermediate peers.  The main benefit of the payment channel paradigm is that it dramatically reduces the transaction volume arriving at the blockchain, without adding new trusted and centralized parties.
While payment channels offer a solution to the scaling problem, they suffer from some of the well-known privacy weaknesses of Bitcoin.  Although payments are conducted off chain, any party may learn the pseudonymous identities and initial (resp.  final) channel balances of the participants.  More critically, payment channels provide few privacy protections against transaction counterparties.  By establishing a channel to pay for e.g., Tor bandwidth or web content, a user
implicitly links each payment on a given channel to all of her other payments on this channel.  This is particularly problematic in the likely event that payments are routed via a common intermediate peer | such as a currency exchange | since the intermediary must now be trusted to keep private your full payment history.  Some proposals, such as the Lightning Network, have proposed to work around this problem by routing the payment via
multiple intermediary nodes; however this approach substantially increases the complexity of establishing payment channels, and reveals payment information in the event that even a subset of the intermediaries collude.
Although several techniques have been proposed to address the privacy problems of Bitcoin-type currencies, these solutions do not address the setting of payment
channels.  This is due to channels' pairwise structure.  Even if a channel is funded with anonymous
currency, repeated payments within the same channel are inherently linkable.  This is concerning,
given that one of the main proposed applications of channels is for web micropayments | which are often described as a more private alternative to tracking and online behavioral advertising.
Finally, we stress that privacy concerns in Bitcoin are not just theoretical.  Several commercial ventures have been founded around the task of analyzing and tracing Bitcoin
transactions, potentially using auxiliary data gathered from exchanges.
Our  Contribution.
In  this  paper  we  propose  Blind  Off-chain  Lightweight  Transactions,  or Bolt.  Bolt comprises of a set of techniques for constructing privacy-preserving
unlinkable payment channels for a decentralized currency.
In this work we showed how to construct anonymous payment channels between two mutually
distrustful parties.  Our protocols can be instantiated using effcient cryptographic primitives with no
trusted third parties and (in many instantiations) no trusted setup.  Payments of arbitrary value can
be conducted directly between the parties, or via an intermediate connection who learns neither the
participants identities nor the amount involved.  Coupled with an decentralized anonymous payment
scheme  for  funding  the  channels,  they  provide  for  private  instantaneous  anonymous  payments
without a trusted bank.
We leave two main open problems.  The first is to investigate the necessary details for extending
the third party payment protocol to support arbitrary paths consisting of n &gt; 3 parties.  Second, we did not consider the problem of performing payment resolution (in the event of a dispute) without revealing the final channel balance to the network.

well, it's possible that I'm mis-reading BIP32, but I don't see where it specifies a fully hardened path for the default wallet layout.  
BIP32 states:




[Per Jonas Schnelli]( bitcoin-core " only hardened private key derivation":  m/0'/0'/k'
Further, the author of this table lists some wallets as using BIP32 path, but bitcoin-core is not one:
So if I'm having a misunderstanding, perhaps you can correct it...
otherwise, I would ask where is a BIP that specifies the specific hardened path m/0'/0'/k' used by bitcoin-core's HD wallet?
I will grant that the bitcoin-core path is *related* to the default wallet path in bip32...

@_date: 2018-12-20 22:59:27


key phrase:  *they delete the software wallet*.   A user could just as easily sweep from any given address in HD wallet A into HD wallet B and then delete wallet B.  Deleting a wallet is never a bright idea if it ever had any funds in it.
But if we want to get into cherry picking reddit comments, I've seen various people dealing with lost fund issues due to HD wallet gap limit, wrong bip32 path, forgotten mnemonic words, etc.
Don't get me wrong:  I see great value in HD wallets, and I've written several tools that deal with them.  The biggest win is getting rid of the disaster of a keypool in bitcoin-core where funds could be sent to change addresses or keys not found in older backups.  But when it comes to storing funds for the very long term, I like simplicity, and a single address paper wallet is about as simple as it gets.  
Stored funds can easily be checked/verified any time by any block explorer without even requiring a software download.   Try that with a mnemonic phrase.
I have no problem with others that prefer to store BTC in a different way.  I just let them be, though some seem dangerous to me, like USB keys or Trezor without a paper backup.  I certainly do not loudly and publically call their method "bad and dangerous and should not be used".

I bought my first one used.  But even brand new they offer a better value because they have much thicker plates and use a different battery chemistry (lead-antimony) so they can last longer and take more abuse than a regular "deep cycle".  It is commonly stated they can last 15-20 years in a solar application.    I think that if you compare total amp-hour capacity (be sure to use the same discharge rate) you will find that forklift batteries are also the cheapest option on the market.

as you say, cryptocurrency consensus code is largely set in stone at time of launch.  At least for coins with communities that actually care about such things.
imho it would solve a lot of conflict and be better overall if the crypto community shared an understanding that significant consensus layer changes should be launched together with a new genesis block.  
In this fashion, new changes can be launched without controversy and people can migrate to the new blockchains in an opt-in fashion via the market.
We already sort of have this with alt-coins, but i wish that bitcoin's top brains would focus their efforts on innovating new features and modular architecture with this type of deployment rather than spinning wheels debating about soft fork, hard fork, technical debt, etc endlessly.
I find the grin project interesting.  Building mimblewimble from the ground up.   We need more of that type of innovation.

well if bitcoin forks or splits I will strongly consider releasing a new genesis block with the following properties:
1. transaction malleability fixed / lightning capable.  ( segwit or otherwise)
2. an ethos that project core developers will never upgrade or modify the core consensus rules.  in other words, no soft-forks or hard forks.
3. That if the consensus rules become too limiting, then upgrades will be released with a new genesis block, so that both versions can co-exist and market can choose between them.  ie, any such upgrade would be entirely opt-in for every person.
Note that (2) is not enforceable in code afaict, but is instead a founding ethos of the project  and the hope would be that by getting enough early adopters and hodlers that agree with this ethos we could bootstrap ourselves to a coin that is truly unchangeable, in the way that ipv4 is.
or.... maybe bitcoin will just remain unchanged and I won't need to bother.    ;-)

1.  The consensus rules were in place when you bought in or mined.  Its sort of like you didn't read the fine print.

not ignoring.  Giving it about as much attention as CB themselves do.   If Coinbase made user-held keys (vaults in their lingo) the only storage method so that they are no longer primarily a custodial service I wouldn't have a much beef with them because they could not freeze their customer's funds.

@_date: 2017-06-11 08:23:42


Not true.  this is old-school thinking.
After the new coin is launched with a new gensis block, both blockchains peacefully co-exist.  If the new one has really compelling advancements, eg privacy, scalability, speed, etc, then the market should eventually adopt it.  by mining or buying.   But each individual is free to make his or her own decision.  Some may like the rules of the old system and decide never to leave it.  If there are enough of them, then it can survive, and that's fine because it means there is a niche for it.
Soft and hard forks are different because they attempt to change the rules of the existing system coercively (eg by majority of hashpower or stake) and without consent of each and every investor.

I guess I don't see how it needs to be handled any differently than any other key that is exported with dumpprivkey.
It occurs to me now though that a better bitcoind RPC implementation would actually generate a new bip32 master key and bip39 phrase without storing them anywhere. 
My hd-wallet-derive tool already does this with --gen-key flag, but I'm toying with the idea of making a standalone offline tool for generating bip32 paper wallet, with nice printable graphic image containing encrypted bip39 words and 1st public address; user would write down passphrase to view bip39 words or write words directly, so printer never sees them plaintext.
Of course, if I could just use a well-audited bitcoin-core RPC or tool for this purpose, I wouldn't bother to write or use a 3rd party tool.

Perhaps to a certain extent politics still happens, but if we compare level and intensity of people trying to convert others to their alt-coin vs bitcoiner's arguing over scaling options, the latter is clearly much more intense and divisive.   Arguably because the perceived result is basically winner take all and forcing the rest to come along whole hog, as opposed to convincing one person at a time, and each person can also keep their previous investments unchanged.

This division is not necessarily a bad thing because it is thus far at least preventing controversial changes from being deployed.

@_date: 2017-06-07 06:34:11
these numbers could likely be trimmed quite a bit by adding the requirement that the inputs all resulted from a coinbase (mining) tx.  But I'm not sure how to make that query... it might even require custom blockchain parsing code.
Let's try a shortcut instead.  If we assume that all mining outputs were from before the first halving and therefore worth 50 BTC, then there should be 10 inputs.  We can easily search for tx with 10 inputs.
    year    num_500_btc_tx
    2009    9
    2010    107
    2011    31
    2012    5
    2013    23
That's a lot less!  maybe we are getting somewhere?

        count(*) as num_500_btc_tx

you might be right.
or it might be that people (the market) actually value immutability, stability, security, and "unchanging-ness", ie gold-like properties, more than scalability.  Even if it means that individuals do a very small number of tx per year with high fees.
maybe some (I would venture most) people prefer not to be on a continuous upgrade treadmill when it comes to the software that safeguards a sizeable portion of their wealth.
have you seriously considered that?
also, where is it written that lightning, or something similar cannot be used on top of bitcoin without segwit?   I understand there are some compromises to be made, eg channels must timeout, but maybe it is time to bite the bullet and just do it...

The tails case is kind of interesting, though I wonder which wallet software these people are using that doesn't require them to write down and re-enter bip39 words at the time of wallet creation.
Really, I consider anything that is stored 100% offline, and safe from electronic failure to be a "paper wallet" whether single key or bip32/bip39.   
What truly worries me is when people say they have funds on a hardware wallet, hard drive, usb key, etc without offline backup.

yeah, I wouldn't be aiming for a large movement or expecting one.  Only hopefully one big enough to be effective.   Anyway, judging from posts on reddit and bitcointalk, and the poll that luke-jr recently posted, it seems clear that status quo position is a quite small minority, though of course that does not represent the larger community who may hold some btc but not really follow the day to day at all.
I view a status quo client as a seed that a few dedicated people can rally around to more effectively inject their views into the conversation.  The other part of the seed would be a mining pool that runs the client.   I think that even one or a few blocks mined by such a client would be an announcement to the larger bitcoin community that there are those who do not agree with upgrading the consensus layer.
Anyway, I see no harm in creating such a client.  maybe some people use it, or maybe they don't.




I go along with most all enhancements core makes (ui, performance, privacy, etc) that do not affect the consensus layer.  However, I feel that the consensus layer itself (the rules that are validated worldwide) should be inviolate, for reasons already stated.  the one exception being if a serious bug or security flaw is found.  I think this is the only position truly compatible with your nashian bitcoin-as-yardstick philosophy.  no?

I'm not sure that your text supports your conclusion.
It has been stated many times that LN can operate on present-day bitcoin.  So far devs have chosen not to do this because it would require a compromise, ie that channels must be timelocked.  Still, a timelock of 10000+ years is effectively open forever.   Someone please correct me if I'm wrong.... 
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:22:24
OP is not exactly unbiased here as he wrote the wiki page as it now stands.   Prior to his edits, the page was much more balanced, and gave detailed instruction how to make a paper wallet and what to be careful about.
See for yourself:
I will also mention that a couple years back I proposed a patch on the bitcoin-dev list so that bitcoin-core would have an RPC call to generate a paper wallet (ie a key pair not included in the hot wallet), thereby providing an "official" way to do it that didn't rely on 3rd party javascript websites, etc.    The devs said they didn't want it and would not accept a patch..... thus perpetuating the status quo.
Mnemonic phrases are fine but there isn't really one standard way that is supported by all wallets.  Bitcoin-core is different from pretty much everything else.  Various wallet's use different bip32 paths and there isn't any versioning built into the mnemonics.   Until that changes,  I would still recommend for long term storage a simple paper wallet (private key) etched onto metal with the date and software version over pretty much any other solution.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:12:07
ah, finally someone that can at least grasp the concept.   thanks.   :-)


In that case, then the old coin must be "good enough".  So we can all just stick with it.  yay, we're done, and we now have a stable money that can be used worldwide.
But if the above is not true, then *some* people at least will migrate to a superior form when it becomes available.
As a hypothetical, imagine that the core devs took a 6 month retreat from bitcoin and instead bundled together all best ideas from research that has been done for *imagined* bitcoin upgrades into a new coin.  So we might get things like:
* modular code
* bitcoin-ng
* transaction malleability fix
* segwit
* lightning network
* schnorr sigs
* confidential transactions
* ring signatures or mimblewimble
In a clean room design, it is possible to take what we have learned in the past 5+ years and make something new and improved that fixes many things that can not really be fixed correctly with soft-forks or incremental improvements.
Now when this new coin is released, no one has to use it.  Each individual can decide for themself.  No politics are necessary.  Politics is only needed when a group of individuals try to impose their particular views on others.  That is what is happening with bitcoin today.
Now, one can argue that we already have the model I am talking about, and it is altcoins.  That is true.  In fact, the market is presently indicating that it likes Ethereum which has genuinely innovated.  I'm not actually a fan of ethereum so I think it is just riding a speculative wave and I don't believe it will succeed long term.
However, I do see real possibility for mimblewimble, which is also showing real innovation but this time with a strong focus on privacy and scalability.  Therefore, the grin project is one to keep a very close eye on.


I would happily switch to a new coin that preserves bitcoin's monetary properties but also has excelent privacy and scaling properties.   anyway, nothing says that it is an all or nothing proposition.  People can invest into both as they see fit.

It does not mean that bitcoin is itself the chosen one.  If/when a crypto arises with better privacy, scaling properties, and also resists change.... we could have a winner.

Well said OP.
I vote for status quo.  It is more important to demonstrate that a crypto currency can be *unchangeable* than anything else.
Layer 2 solutions can be built on top of bitcoin as-is.   The community should move forward with that instead of all this infighting.

just taking issue with your claim that they are impossible to use correctly.  Seems like serious hyperbole.
I think most here would agree that a single-address paper wallet has been used "correctly" if it was generated securely offline, funds were successfully sent to it, and later spent from it in its entirety, without loss of funds.    As many here have achieved this feat, seemingly we have done the impossible.
I understand the risks, and your concerns for noobs, etc. 
I think many here are taking offense because paper wallets were for a long time considered best practice for long term storage, and many have utilized them for such.  Now you seem to be saying that is all wrong and people were wrong to ever use them.  basically, the sky is falling.   Whereas I would take the position that for anyone who already has a securely generated paper wallet, they may as well leave it there until such time as they need to utilize the funds, and then perhaps store the change in an HD paper wallet, and if they truly know what they are doing, understand the risks, take personal responsibility, and already have a working system then a single-key based wallet is just fine for them.

The fine print is and always has been the consensus critical code.
Satoshi was able to make some changes back when the user base was small and he basically "snuck in" the limit.  That can't happen today.
All this debate is pointless.  The code says what it says.

hopefully it will be bitcoin.  would be a shame to destroy the goodwill it is has earned over the years.
Greg, if segwit doesn't get activated in a reasonable timeframe, what are your thoughts regarding running a layer 2 solution (eg lightning) over unmodified bitcoin?
My understanding is that it is possible, but would mean that each payment channel has a timeout.
Are there other issues?
maybe this could be a path forward until such time as there is consensus for a soft fork.  if ever.

Coinbase founders made a choice under which jurisdiction to operate, or to go into business at all.
Many others looked at the same landscape and decided to operate elsewhere, or avoid such a heavily regulated business model altogether.
I don't buy the "they have no choice but to comply" arguments.  Its a weak copout.

for the most part. Ideally and morally, any change should require agreement of every single person that holds the currency, ie 100% consensus.   Otherwise the system devolves to tyranny of the majority and is not much better than fiat.  there is a moral hazard.
A new coin does not need to be perfect from the start because it does not have to "live" forever.  After a few iterations/evolutions, we should have one that is good enough and old ones can survive or die naturally as the market decides.  but no one is forced to change consensus rules that were in place when they invested.
Think of plants and animals.  Individual animals typically do not upgrade their rules (ie genetics).  But their offspring can have new rules and thereby advance.
This community seems so locked into the old model of constantly upgrading software that most seem unable to grasp the concept that there is great value in a software that resists upgrades and resists all changes to its rules.  That is the unique value proposition of bitcoin, and instead of embracing it, people are spending years beating their heads against it.

1.  maybe we do, maybe we don't.  It seems to me that bitcoin is working quite well as a store of value.
2. even if we do, there are multiple ways to scale.  doesn't mean that bitcoin consensus rules need to change.
@_date: 2017-06-14 03:16:12
It seems you never understood bitcoin.
Did you somehow not see that the blockspace would fill up?
Or if you did, then what... you thought the consensus rules would change somehow?    If so, then you did not understand bitcoin.
bitcoin resists controversial changes.
that's kind of like.   umm....   the point.

I do not seek constant improvement of the consensus layer for a given blockchain.  Instead, I argue that is in fact immoral as people are investing lots of money into each coin with a given set of rules, and may not have given consent for proposed changes.  Just I have not given my assent for bitcoin consensus rules to be modified.   Changes to consensus rules (or even discussion of such) can cause a lot of market turmoil.  In terms of effect on the market, this is really not much different from the Federal Reserve discussing a change to interest rates.   And I think most all here would agree that no one should have such control over a currency.  that's pretty much the point of bitcoin, actually.


disagree.  software standards that are widely enough distributed and "baked in" can become difficult to impossible to change.  ipv4 has remained the same.  go and change it, I dare ya.


so now it seems we are disagreeing only about when, not if.  And I argue that sooner is better.


I'll believe it when I see it.  anyway, the arrival of such could constitute an existential threat/bug, and if a solution is proposed that 99.9% of the community supports, I could get behind it.


that doesn't sound like a bitcoin bug.  only some other software running on a local computer.  doesn't need solving at bitcoin level.  we don't change ipv4 due to viruses either.

@_date: 2018-12-20 17:33:13
yes, but bitcoin-core, ie the official reference client, uses a different scheme with a totally hardened path in its HD wallet implementation.  I could be mistaken, but I don't think there is even a bip for it.
Also, there is nothing in either a mnemonic or xpub/xpriv to indicate which path scheme is used, so one may need to search a nearly infinite space of possible paths if one does not know the exact version of software that created the wallet and how it works.   See for example early versions of Copay that used a path with very high integer number in it.

I did most of that yesterday.  Did you see where I narrowed it down to 9 transactions between Jan 2012 and Dec 2013?  [link](
I can narrow it down a little further by including only those where the first input address received its funds from coinbase (mining) tx.  I'm doing this manually on a block explorer, so no query to show (and that's why I'm only checking the first address, not all 10).   With this method, I found two addresses where the first input did not come from a coinbase.
So here is the revised list of 7 possibles:
    TimeStampUtc            TXID

When you say "account", I think you mean wallet.  All 7 transactions I found have inputs from 10 distinct addresses for 50 BTC each.  This means that with very high degree of probability, all 10 addresses were located in the same wallet.  But it is not easy to associate any other addresses with each wallet, so very hard to determine which, if any of those wallets never had any other transfers.  ie, dead end, at least without sophisticated analysis.
If it were me, I would take those 7 transactions to a blockchain analytics company or person, and ask if any of the 7 destination addresses belong to a cluster of addresses that were associated with a known wallet service.
Also, if you think you might have made the transfer before 2012, you can just change the date in the query to find older transactions.  There were many in 2011.

many/most people in that situation of living paycheck to paycheck are doing so because they realize (perhaps unconsciously) that there is no point to saving when the savings are being inflated away and their money will be worth less in the future.
If instead they were being paid with hard money, they would soon begin socking away a little (or more) each month as they (perhaps unconsciously) realize that their money will have more buying power in the future than today.
Savings eventually lead to investment, entrepreneurship, prosperity.

I don't believe the balance can ever really be wrong when calculated based on simple P2PKH outputs.  That is a simple sum of the present utxo set filtered by a particular address.
However it is more complicated for multisig addresses because multiple signatures/keys are required.  The money is effectively split across multiple addresses... so logically, it might not even be spendable.
As I understand it, bitcoind ignores these addresses for balance purposes unless all private keys are in the wallet.  However, it can be told to include them by adding the address as as watch-only address.

I'm just saying that the authors of theDao were supremely irresponsible accepting that amount of funds riding on an alpha level application built atop an alpha level platform.
Of course, investors were irresponsible because they all agreed that "code is law" and then started whining when they figured out the code didn't do what they liked.
Then the eth devs were supremely irresponsible forking away from the real chain to bail out the irresponsible investors, setting a terrible precedent for entire crypto space in the process.
I wish members of the eth community the best, but I have no desire to be a part of it.
at least the eth classic members/miners showed some principle and some spine.

it's better to avoid changes to the core protocol.  Even if we agree with them at a technical level.
Software that can stand the test of time, unchanged, is pretty much unheard of.  Bitcoin has that potential.

Fair enough.  You are looking out for noobs and less technically inclined.  I'm coming from the vantage point of what works for me.
I feel like the biggest problems in the space are (a) people that do not hold their keys in the first place, and (b) people that store their keys only in electronic form forgetting that digital media typically have very short-lifespans.
Group a is so large and experiences so many losses routinely... I  hope that can improve.

regardless of original intent (appeal to authority) the system is what it is.  The block size limit is in the consensus layer of code, and changing it (higher or lower) would be a controversial change.  It is therefore exceedingly unlikely to happen.  I will go so far as to predict that it never happens.
This conclusion is easily reached without needing to evaluate any merits of arguments for or against changing it.  It simply is what it is.
Until people come to this realization, you will continue banging your head against the brick wall of bitcoin's immutability.

if bitcoin hardforks (I don't believe it will) and the status quo chain is a small minority then it will be difficult for us to mine blocks given the difficulty and slow adjustment time.   That could kill off the minority fork.  Or, as you say, it could hard-fork to a lower difficulty, but then it is no longer the status quo bitcoin and has lost credibility as the unchanged version.
Anyway, a community split and 2 viable forks would be a blow to the crypto ecosystem because why should anyone believe in a currency that can split in two and essentially double the money supply overnight.
Yes, eth and etc have done that and survived/thrived.  Personally I think it was a mistake and their market cap is 99% speculation and will pop.   But time will tell.

@_date: 2017-06-03 17:47:42
my crystal ball says....
all present proposals will fail.   none have consensus.  bitcoin with a diverse community resists change to consensus layer.   that's what makes it great.
the only types of forward movement that make sense to me are:
1. adapt lightning network to work on bitcoin as-is (without segwit).
2. create bitcoin 2.0 project, led by core devs, that incorporates the best ideas from past several years and starts with clean slate.  When ready for launch, start with a new genesis block and let people get in via mining and market.  This will be entirely opt-in situation.
It might be possible to make a temporary one or two way peg to the new chain, allowing legacy bitcoin holders to migrate without losing value before the old chain dies off.

Here are some wallet services that appear to have been active around 2012-2013.   Perhaps one of them may ring a bell with OP?
* OnionBC5 is an online bitcoin wallet accessible only via Tor. It offers the functionality to send transactions anonymously, for which it takes a fee of 3%6 with a minimum transaction size of 0.5 BTC. Furthermore, it offers an escrow service, that can be used by users buying goods online and paying with bitcoins to hold back a payment until they received the goods they ordered.
* Bitcoin Fog is another service only accessible via Tor. It allows the generation of up to 5 addresses for depositing bitcoins and takes a (random) fee between 1–3% of the transaction value. Bitcoins can be withdrawn to a maximum of 20 addresses, spread over a timespan of 6–96 hours with a minimum total of 0.2 BTC.
* BitLaundry is a simple mixing service, that, in contrast to OnionBC and Bitcoin Fog, does not allow to deposit Bitcoins into a virtual wallet. Instead, the destination addresses, the number of outgoing transactions and a time span have to be specified and a single-use address is generated, where the user has to send at least 0.25 BTC to. The mixing fee for BitLaundry is split into two parts. The first is 2.49% of the total, the second is 0.00249 BTC per outgoing transaction.

I do appreciate your efforts to maintain and update the wiki.
I used the word biased because this topic of Paper Wallets is one where reasonable people can disagree.  Thus, to present only one viewpoint and hide information about the other is a form of bias.
I do not doubt your motivations to help people and the ecosystem at all.  I simply have found paper wallets (ie, not stored electronically) to be the most long-term, future-proof stable and safe way to store bitcoins.  This is especially true for casual investors, who often just want to buy in as an investment and hold for years without even thinking about bitcoin again.
All this hand-wringing about losing coins because of a single address and not understanding change addresses.....  I don't doubt someone has at least once.   But no one I know of.  Most wallet software I've used has a facility to import a private key and either used it directly in address re-use mode, or sweep to a new HD wallet -- that user has been instructed to backup.  I wonder if you can point out to me an example of wallet software that imports a private key into a wallet and then will put change into an address outside the wallet.... as that seems to be what's required to lose funds.
Hardware wallets are fine and all (assuming their code can be trusted) but they are electronic and can fail.  Plus they cost much more than paper or a scrap piece of aluminum and typically must be ordered in advance.  Since they can fail, one ends up backing them up onto other formats such as paper or metal anyway.
Regarding standard ways to do things, I look to the defacto reference client, bitcoin-core for that.  It serializes private keys in WIF format, which is [well documented]( and supported by most clients in the ecosystem.   In contrast, for HD wallets, bitcoin-core uses a hardened path that is different from pretty much every other client, and given an unlabeled set of mnemonic words, its impossible to tell which path/index should be used to locate funds.  I think that's a problem.   not to even get into the whole gap limit thing...

I'll just stick with original bitcoin chain.
uasf?   uahf?  segwit?  segwit2x?
I predict all will fail, just like xt, classic, bu, etc.
time will tell.

no, the seed words are related to HD wallets.  It's based on key derivation, and unrelated to cpu security facilities.

thanks for your hard work and perseverance.  I know it can be a frustrating experience getting code accepted into core.
So I actually have a use case for exporting the xpub, as I am the author of [hd-wallet-addrs]( [bitprices]( and [mybitprices.info]( which together provide some free wallet auditing and reporting tools usable by first or third parties, typically requiring only an xpub.
Hopefully these and similar tools can integrate better with bitcoin-core soon... 
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:14:11
would you also applaud a statement that proposes increasing the 21 million cap?    That's about as likely to get changed.... they are both consensus layer limits.
Changing things at the consensus level simply will not happen so long as there is controversy about the change.  This is a STRENGTH of bitcoin.
Whatever else the merits of changing the block-size, the debate is pointless because the very fact it is being widely debated guarantees a change will not be made.
@_date: 2017-06-11 18:16:02
If it doesn't coerce, then why is there so much politics going on?
Politics is about getting enough people "on my side" to force change upon those who do not agree.
The model I am talking about is non coercive.  Both coins happily co-exist, just as bitcoin co-exists with every altcoin today.  and each individual chooses for him or herself.   No politics needed.

bitcoin-core is the defacto reference client, and has by far the most code peer review and security around its build process with deterministic builds, gpg signatures, etc.
If one wishes to generate a new standalone address, I feel that this is the most trustworthy software to do so.  Not some rando 3rd party thing.   And I say this as the author of a [rando 3rd party thing]( for HD key generation.
bitcoin-core already does private key generation.  api calls: getnewaddress, dumprivkey
if a person wants, they can already generate a paper wallet with bitcoin-core.  Just start bitcoind with a fresh wallet, call getnewaddress and dumpprivkey, store it securely, then delete the wallet.dat. 
All my PR would have done is to make this a single simple call, so the generated priv key would not be stored in the bitcoind wallet at all and there is no need to muck around with wallet.dat files.  It would not be exposed in UI, so only advanced users would find it anyway.
oh well.

according to that, we are significantly below the trendline at the moment.
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:23:12
so the master xpub cannot be retrieved even via RPC?
I can understand not exposing it to users via GUI, but as a developer I certainly want access to it. 
I mean, in the non HD wallet I can even dump all private keys.
master xpriv and xpub both should be accessible once wallet is unlocked.

1. it is well known that lightning can work on present bitcoin, but with some limitations that would not be needed with segwit.  even nullc confirmed this recently.  also stephen pair of bitpay recently stated on a podcast that they have a layer 2 solution (not lightning) in the works that works with present day bitcoin.
2. as opposed to every other ICO since 2009?   you don't make sense.

Given that bitcointalk is using nginx, I believe it is likely a known (and very common) nginx misconfiguration.
theymos, please post the location sections of your nginx config.
From 
-- quote --
Passing Uncontrolled Requests to PHP
Many example Nginx configurations for PHP on the web advocate passing every URI ending in .php to the PHP interpreter. Note that this presents a serious security issue on most PHP setups as it may allow arbitrary code execution by third parties.
The problem section usually looks like this:
location ~* \.php$ {
  fastcgi_pass backend;
  ...
Here, every request ending in .php will be passed to the FastCGI backend. The issue with this is that the default PHP configuration tries to guess which file you want to execute if the full path does not lead to an actual file on the filesystem.
For instance, if a request is made for /forum/avatar/1232.jpg/file.php which does not exist but if /forum/avatar/1232.jpg does, the PHP interpreter will process /forum/avatar/1232.jpg instead. If this contains embedded PHP code, this code will be executed accordingly.
Options for avoiding this are:
    Set cgi.fix_pathinfo=0 in php.ini. This causes the PHP interpreter to only try the literal path given and to stop processing if the file is not found. 
    Ensure that Nginx only passes specific PHP files for execution. 
Specifically disable the execution of PHP files in any directory containing user uploads. 
Use the try_files directive to filter out the problem condition 
Use a nested location to filter out the problem condition
