Segwit causes centralisation, but the change is small enough that the community accepted the trade off. A straight 8m block size limit would make it much harder to sync and validate blocks.

It's not a DAG, it's not directed, transactions can route in either direction through a channel, and it's not acyclic, the network topology is completely unconstrained. And describing an unstructured network as a graph is needless pedantry.

You must have got lucky somehow, because it doesn't look like txs at that fee rate have been confirming all that much:

@_date: 2018-01-17 14:15:02
Well lots of exchanges have different fees, so the effect is obviously not immediate.
Also, this is true of segwit vs not-segwit. Competitors who adopt segwit could offer low fees. That's still an argument for adopting segwit, so you don't get undercut by competitors who do.

How would an observer link up a channel and any on-chain activity?
The only vector I can think of is timing, and once Lightning grows in activity, it will become harder to figure out which channel was opened at the same time as which transaction got confirmed. 
The rest of your points I agree with. These are tradeoffs that come from having to operate a piece of software that connects to the internet. There will always be a way to tie ip addresses back to whoever controls them.

I wasn't comparing pow to proof of stake mining, which is not what the lightning network is. I was referring to the impact of who controls nodes. The amount you have committed on the LN is irrelevant. Whether you've got 10 sats or 10  BTC, if your channel partner becomes uncooperative and you wanted to spend, that's an inconvenience. 
I think you've distracted yourself by drifting off topic.

A larger user base isn't a relevant metric by which to judge the effect of segwit on tx fee changes.

It is. The issue is the well-connectedness of nodes, not centralisation. Having 1000 channels doesn't make one node able to do more damage than having 5. If the channel refuses to route payments, they'll get routed somewhere else, and people will stop opening channels with that node.


This is a non-sequitur, it does not follow that because having one central node means that a large network with some proportion of atypically highly connected nodes has the same problem. What matters is that nodes are well connected, if some are very well connected, while others are exceptionally well connected, there is no problem. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:35:04

It's channels. Anyone can have as many channels as they want. That's not centralization.

If they keep charging the same fees, but use segwit, that's money for them. 
Also there's a very real chance of losing customers, perhaps not many, but there does seem to be growing sentiment around moving to services that support segwit over those that don't, amongst the community.

No, we're saying centralisation is not a relevant concept. centralisation is a problem for proof of work blockchains that use the length of the blockchain as the deciding metric for truth. Lightning is not a proof of work blockchain that uses the length of the blockchain as the deciding metric for truth (because there isn't a blockchain).

Yeah schnorr sigs will likely be what makes channel factories feasible
@_date: 2018-01-04 01:00:22
I'm sorry, but I don't see how it can. 
Miners could continue to produce blocks with &gt;N% non-segwit transactions, and so long as they had the most hashing power, their chains would be longer, and that's what bitcoin would be.
A miner-activated soft fork could work, but assuming miners adopted such a fork, that would mean miners essentially forcing everyone to use segwit, and software support is lacking, so a lot of users would be put in very difficult situations. Also, moving their funds to a segwit wallet would become increasingly expensive. 
This kind of non-consensual forcing of people's hands is precisely what the distributed nature of bitcoin is supposed to protect against.
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:11:20
Without a fix for transaction malleability, implementing payment channels is very difficult and more limited that if you have segwit. Nobody will do it, it would be silly.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:54:35
You do pay fees for lightning transactions though, so it's not quite the same.
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:12:54
Segwit increased the blocksize. It was just a better way to do it.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:03:21
The bare minimum would be exposing an ip address, though you could use a proxy. You can't coordinate to open a channel with another node without some network communication happening between your node and the other. I suppose someone could come up with an attack protocol where they open a channel, immediately close it, then somehow get a new ip and do it again, but such an attack would be immensely costly, not necessarily monetarily (though that would be the case for ipv4), but more in time, it is not trivial to keep changing ip address, even if you have a cheap and plentiful allocation of them. 
And I agree with you that identity is not important for bitcoin, but for the reasons you highlight, who you open an lightning channel with is more of a consideration, they won't know who you're paying via their hub/node, but they will know they have a channel open with you, in some fashion. Lightning is peer to peer, and connecting to a reliable peer will be important, especially early on, while fees are still very high. There will be a trade-off, between opening a channel with a completely unknown partner, or with a close friend or relative, inherently you have better information with which to judge the likely reliability of a channel with a friend or relative. 
Because opening and closing channels has a cost, reputation for being a stable channel partner will be a factor with lightning, but that doesn't necessarily have to be tied to the identity of a person.  Maybe someone could create an ethereum autonomous corporation which takes investment from a wide segment of the community, and which automatically spins up AWS EC2 instances running Lightning node software in response to demand, and the platform is programmed to honour whatever desired channel lifetime that channel partners request when creating a channel with it, and to always accept channel opening requests, and fees for routing transactions could be paid back to investors. Such a system could act as a sort of neutral matrix around which the 'real' network could grow, providing a starting level of confidence so that LN users could at least know that if they want to join the network and stay part of it, they don't have to worry about dealing with unreliable channel partners.

Sharding wouldn't necessarily help scaling directly, but it may make people feel ok about block size changes
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:53:44


But that's not quite what I said. I'm not advocating it, I'm asking by what metrics do we judge the appropriate block size for a given level of adoption. If many decades from now, there are billions of bitcoin users, and computer hardware and bandwidth cost a fraction of what they do today, how do we figure out what is an appropriate block size?
If we look at segwit, assuming wide adoption, 90%+, it will result in blocks that are ~2MB in size, there seems now a general support for segwit amongst the community, and so is it not fair to ask, how was that consensus achieved, in the context of current computer and bandwidth costs? The community has said, "~2MB blocks are fine", so, feet to the fire, why? By what metrics did the community judge this new larger block size to be acceptable?

If anything you have said is true, then it can be done  already. All that's being suggested is to add the metric to the block header, that metric already exists. You just look at blocks and see what the lowest fees were. A full node can already do this, this change would simply make it easier for spv wallets to do it.

So you could have a client that allows a channel to have a total balance above 0.167, but you couldn't make a transaction for more than that?

LN is useful for transaction with other people using the LN. You've probably heard a lot of talk about channels and got too focused on that, but the LN isn't just about making a channel with the person you wish to transact with, you can send transactions via other channels, in a manner similar to how network connections traverse the tor network, so you can transact with anyone else on the network, not just people you have channels with.

A fixed block size limit will always self-correct for the volume of transactions that can be supported. Situations like this will occur when more transactions than can be supported are attempted to be made. Eventually people will start to sell, if they can, due to the insanely high fees, the price will drop, interest will drop, and eventually this will lead to fewer transactions.

That would tie a single channel to a utxo used to fund a channel, and a utxo when it gets closed, sent to a fresh receiving address, but so long as you don't re-use addresses, it seems it would be hard to link that information up with anything else.

That's the idea. For bitcoin the difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks, which would normally be roughly 2 weeks, so if the hashpower drops markedly in a short space of time (less than 2 weeks), then it could take longer than 2 weeks between adjustments.

I use segwit, but you can't deny what's in the mempool. To get a 80 sat/B tx through in the last 24 hours is extremely surprising, and there must have been a miner out there that included that transaction over another that would have paid them a higher fee, just look:
as others have pointed out, OP paid 126 sat per byte, not 80.

The transactions occur between channel partners. They are not recorded anywhere publicly visible. 
What is on the blockchain is a simple transactions to the 2 of 2 wallet for the channel, then the closing transaction from that 2 of 2 wallet to the channel partners according to their final balance. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:49:39


If you make no transactions of your own, that's precisely what you're doing. 
But yeah, the node needs to be online, there's no getting around that really. Eventually with the watchtower system you'll be able to have a third party monitor for you, but they'll take a fee for it, and it will likely be more cost effective to simply have a computer you leave on.

It's not my argument, it's up to the developers of whatever software. A 2.0 release of a client could also have an alpha and beta phase.

No, that's not what beta has meant in software development for a long time.

For nodes to automatically relay transactions on the LN, they would need to be able to access the private key to update the channel closing transactions. Therefore a hardware wallet can only work easily for a non-routing node.

My perspective is that we need those people to sell out now, bitcoin is still not at the level of maturity where it can comfortably support mainstream speculation, the past 2 and a half months have proven that. As you say, these are fair weather bitcoin buyers, they do not represent organic growth.

That would require a hard fork, segwit has activated on the bitcoin blockchain, therefore the effective blocksize limit would be almost 8MB, which is the bcash block limit, but you said we shouldn't raise the bitcoin block size limit to bcash standards...

Each of which comprises one hundred million satoshis, and at any point the protocol could be forked to support smaller subdivisions. 


Are you ok OP? 


Nothing, the same thing happens with regular fiat currency and we get by. Once cryptocurrencies become widely accepted for payment, there'll be less need to ever exchange between crypto and fiat, so exchange rates will matter less and less. 


On the base blockchain? Nothing except a block time interval reduction. Off the base blockchain? Sidechains maybe. So long as the fee set is reasonable, unconfirmed transactions can be relied upon to eventually be added to a block, this isn't as big an issue as you're suggesting.


If all transactions used segwit, the mempool would clear within a day or two. 
And the problem is not the price of bitcoin, it's competition to get transactions into blocks. No matter the price of bitcoin, if there are more transactions than can be processed per unit time, the tx fees will continue to grow. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:16:05
Competition is also an appropriate term to describe how tx fees are chosen in terms of getting into a block at all, that's how things are now, it's just you don't see it clearly because the demand for tx so vastly outstrips the capacity of the network, fees just end up being whatever tx makers are willing to pay to get their tx through in a given amount of time. If you can fit more txs per unit time (with segwit), then the competition to have a tx get mined in that given amount of time, is lessened, though if demand continues to outgrow the capacity of the blocks, it may not seem that way. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:10:05
I'm just trying to start a polite conversation. 
I know about the 4 Mega-weight-unit limit, but I was just trying to keep the terminology straightforward so people would understand.
Also, the metrics by which the appropriateness of such a change could be judged, don't really depend on the current limit. 
It sounds like you have a good understanding of bitcoin works, so I'd really appreciate your feedback on my question. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:10:05
Why do we even need an analogy? It's not complicated. Bcash makes the blocks bigger, segwit makes more txs fit into a block. 
We don't need to dumb that down. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 07:54:16
Are you able to answer my question?
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:36:55
This is a tricky question. The lightning protocol doesn't mandate anything in regards to how fees are determined. The obvious starting point is to do what a lot of wallets do, copy the average transaction fee from the past x blocks, use that, and have each channel partner contribute 50% of the fee. Alternatively the channel partners would have to agree to a fee, and to the distribution of how it is funded. 
This is mostly a behaviour and user interface issue. I expect simpler approaches will be used first (50/50, calculated fees). It's also conceivable that LN clients could include  a basic chat feature, through which channel partners could discuss how they'd like to cover fees. 
Edit: Eclair wallet doesn't currently even expose the option as far as I can see, it must be setting fees under the hood.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:07:54
If a fork is user activated, you can't force users to use it, otherwise that would make it not user activated.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:17:47
If you create channels with very long locktimes, then you can have the same security as with a hardware wallet by just shutting down your client. So long as you use the watchtower system, or come online before the locktime ends, your fine. This is all talking as an end user of course.
The challenge is operating a node or hub which routes LN payments. These are inherently more high risk, for the reason you say, the keys must be in memory, and if someone can hack the computer that the node lives on, and dump its memory, they have the keys. I don't know of any good direct technical solution. The best thing to do is to employ good security practices, lock down the server on which you run a routing LN node as much as you can, and only keep a minimum amount of funds loaded into channels that you're willing to commit and risk, vs how much you get in fees.
@_date: 2018-01-09 10:46:20


It's not so simple, the fees that people pay, per byte, are lower with segwit. Also, if you assume, for a second, that transaction load remains constant, then the overall fee payment per block should go down, as there would be less competition per block. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:13:10


No, segwit increases the block size, go look it up.
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:54:49


The only way to account for irrational actors is to never have a user-activated soft fork, which is not an appealing notion.


The amount of btc transacted isn't relevant.
In order to carry out the 'attack' you describe, the attacker would in essence be simply paying bitcoin miners for nothing. Such an attack would cost over a million dollars an hour, using segwit, more otherwise. It is hard to see how a malicious government could ever rationalise such an attack. Such a government would also have to carry out such an attack forever, since as soon as they stop, people could begin to use the network as before. If people completely abandon bitcoin, they could move to another cryptocurrency, and the government would then have to perform the same attack, likely at the same cost, for the next coin, and so on and so on. 
I think that *is* far fetched.


High adoption is not an attack. There is no suggestion right now that the competition for tx fees is anything but legitimate users who either do not know what they are doing, or for whom the cost is not prohibitive. 
This is a problem, for sure, but not an attack, and increased block size does not solve the problem, it will return when adoption increases. We need solutions that either deliver optimisation with low cost, or optimisations that deliver efficiencies orders of magnitude better than simple on chain transactions. Increasing the block size has a high cost. Even if you don't care about decentralisation, disk space and bandwidth are not free, and the people asked to provide them do not get paid to do so. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:13:12
I think 256KiB blocks and a 3.3 minute block time interval would be ideal, assuming lightning succeeds.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:37:17
You can batch up payments to multiple recipients easily, you make one transaction with many outputs, but for the coffee use case, it doesn't have so easy a solution, you can't aggregate inputs between different people without a multisig wallet, which is basically how lightning works, but lightning doesn't need batching, because fees aren't based on the size of transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 15:05:48


Nodes can't be centralised. That makes no sense. You prove this by saying centralisation is based on the topology. Nodes don't have topology, networks do. 


for a minute we'll go alone with that aritrary word. We'll call that situation 'centralisation'.  Now, tell me what is the problem? You lose your money? It goes to someone different than your intended recipient? You don't get it back? The naughty node can change the ownership of coins, any coins?
No. You do get it back, the naughty node can't do shit except waste a little of your time. 
Centralisation is a problem for proof of work mining because centralisation increases the risk of someone being able to destroy the network by taking away so much mining power that it can't function, dictate consensus rules, or carrying out a 51% attack, where someone can undo their historic transactions, taking back money they spent and stealing a handful of block rewards. 
That's why centralisation is bad. 'centralisation' of the LN (which is not what exceptionally highly connected nodes are), does not cause any such problems, or any other problems that are anywhere near as bad. 
If the average node on the LN is well-connected, having few exceptionally highly connected nodes is not a problem.

Right? Even ignoring that the writer obviously knows nothing about mining difficulty, why would mining all the coins sooner be a problem?

I'm ready for the emotion boys, but let's talk about block size limits for real. 
I firmly believe now is not the time for 8MB blocks a la BCH, but as bitcoin adoption grows in the long term, at some point we likely will need a block size limit increase of some kind. I know segwit effectively increases the block size, and am a big fan of segwit, I just want to try to understand how we'll figure out, as a community, when and what size of blocksize increase we'll need. 
So, some metrics that immediately came to mind were things like average amount of RAM of a computer for a given price point, maybe average cost of consumer bandwidth. How should we judge when it's time for a block size increase of a given amount. If it's possible to introduce some kind of sharding to the blockchain to reduce the storage required per node, or maybe if there are optimisations that can be made to processing time for blocks by nodes, would this make it easier to increase the block size limit, as the cost and impact on node operators might be lessened?
Also, given the sort of amplification effect of segwit, should we be considering block size increases on the order of hundreds of KiB, say for example a blocksize limit increase to 1.2-1.4MiB or something like that?
@_date: 2018-01-30 08:37:04

If they exclude low fee txs so that their blocks signal a high price, other miners can just mine those transactions as well as all the other ones that the bad miner mined with higher fees.

If a fee of 10 sat/B got into the last 50 blocks, then it doesn't matter what the rest of the fees were. Users shouldn't be overpaying when they don't need to, that's why the cheapest fee in the block is the one they should be looking at.

The simplest way to achieve this would be a service you pay that sends you btc on the lightning network.

What if someone has a really good idea, submits a BIP, but sucks at coding? Nobody in the world should implement the idea at all until the one guy who suggested it writes some free open-source code for everyone else to take?
I don't mean to argue this point because I don't think it's important, but if people will bring up a point, it ought to be relevant. I don't see this as being relevant. 
If miners and nodes support a new feature, then it is part of Bitcoin.  That's how consensus works with Bitcoin. If you don't like it, you are either in a minority, or you didn't actually participate in the forming of the consensus at all. 
If and when people decide to start making use of a new feature added to Bitcoin, by consensus, that's entirely up to them. Anyone deciding not to use the new feature should be mature enough to take responsibility for their own decision. Not adopting segwit because you want someone else to write some code for you to copy, is not the same as choosing not to adopt it because you don't think it's a good idea, or don't have the resources. I have more respect for people who argue against segwit on merit, even if I don't agree with them, than I have for people who choose not to use segwit simply because they are lazy, and have no motivation to put in work to improve the service they provide to their customers.

But the load on the network has nothing to do with the amount of bitcoins transferred. You could send thousands of bitcoin with a tiny transaction. It's the size that matters, and you pay fees based on size. If someone wants to pay $15 to send $1, why does that not deserve to happen on the blockchain?
And let's not forget, with change addresses, how do you know the transaction is transferring ownership of the the smallest output, or the largest? If you see a transaction with a fee of 100 sat/B, an output for 0.00001 and an output of 5000 BTC, that might be spam, or it might be someone  sending 5000 BTC to an exchange to make a big withdrawal, and forgetting about the 1k sats, or using a wallet that got some rounding wrong when calculating the fee, or a wallet that lets you enter fees completely manually. How can you know?
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:18:21


Lightning doesn't really have this problem. You can run lightning over tor, nobody can block it. Also, the LN is specifically built on ephemeral channels, it is designed in a way that expects channels not to last forever, so channels being shut down isn't a problem really, especially in the long term, once on-chain fees are reduced. That's why I said in another comment that trust will be more important early in LN's life, and over time it will become less important.

Security measures are designed for specific attack models. Encryption protects data from being accessed if stolen or eavesdrop on over the internet.

@_date: 2018-01-29 07:42:53
Centralisation is not a concern with LN, routing nodes can't do anything to your transactions if they have many open channels.
Having more channels helps to provide routing though, so it is good, but the centralisation argument is nonsense that outs the person using it as not understanding why centralisation is bad for pow cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:54:25
I think you might have muddled your numbers.
You could open a channel in which you have balance of 1BTC, and send 10 transactions each for 0.1BTC to someone you intend to pay 1 BTC to. It's not really necessary, but it might be a good way to hide how much you're sending to who, if you're really paranoid that someone might be spying on you.

I understand everything you've said, and I am very pro-decentralisation. I'm talking about how the decision can be measured and made. Even with full segwit adopt, and widespread LN usage, there will come a point maybe months, maybe years, maybe decades from now, where we get back to a situation like we're in now, where the demand for transactions is greater than what can be added to the blockchain. And I'd like to get a discussion going about how we evaluate such a situation. 
Look at my comment history, you'll see I'm very pro-LN, I go out of my way to explain it whenever someone misunderstands or misrepresents it. 


I know this, I never suggested otherwise, I'm trying to get a discussion started about what it would take for that consensus to shift to a point where larger blocks were needed, and how the necessary block size increase would be determined. And I resent the suggestion I am not being honest. 


As I said, I'm pro-decentralization, but to suggest that on-chain scaling can never be appropriate doesn't make sense if you believe that bitcoin can ever reach widespread global adoption. Segwit already increases the maximum possible block size, and the community, at least now, is pretty widely supportive of it. 
If you could look to 10 years in the future, maybe more, it's not unreasonable to expect that computing power, bandwidth or memory will be more greater, or cheaper (same thing really), and so more people would be able to run nodes, or the same people would be able to run a more resource intensive node. It's also realistic to expect that advances will have been made to mitigate the resource intensiveness of running a node, ways to reduce how much data needs to be stored to record the blockchain, for example.
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:23:55

It does not sound reasonable. Bitcoin is an open platform. Bitcoin core is one project that produces Bitcoin compatible software. You cannot rely on one foss project to do all your work for you. 
What kraken is saying is they will just wait until someone else writes some code for them, and releases it somewhere for free and open-sourced. That's not reasonable at all. For-profit enterprises could very easily write their own wallet software, or have their staff contribute to the open-source project they claim to be waiting on, like how coinbase has one of their staff contributing code to the an open-source lightning project.

If you say that segwit makes transactions more compact, with no context, people will assume you are talking about the size. 
As for the utxo set, I don't see how segwit reduces growth of the size of the set. The article you linked to says that segwit is expected to incentivise transactions which minimise utxos, but I don't agree, unless the suggestion is that we want to discourage the use of change addresses. The way I see it, the number of utxos for a given transaction is purely based on the use case. It is already the case that more utxos makes a transaction more expensive, so that price incentive already exists, segwit shuffles that price incentive a little, but I don't know that it can really impact behaviour. 
Besides, is there really a problem with people creating transactions that have unnecessary extra utxos, or is it not the case that the utxo set continues to grow because of increased adoption?


If you'd like to discuss this politely, I'm very keen to hear your take on this. I do my best to understand cryptocurrency, I am reasonably confident in my understanding of segwit in particular, but would like to learn if there is something I have misunderstood.
With a little more reading, I think I understand the rationale. Segwit doesn't actually reduce growth of the utxo set, but it makes it less costly to consolidate multiple utxos as the input for a transaction. I would suggest this does not constitute transactions taking up less space, rather that segwit simply makes it easier to spend dust, but thank you for helping me to understand this.  
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:10:24
Well it would depend on which branch of the fork had most support, but that is how bitcoin works. If there was a fork that some miners didn't support, that would leave a gap, the forked chain with a lower number of miners, and thus lower competition for the mining reward for that chain, adding incentive to mine it, if lots of users supported that fork, the transaction fees would be higher. Miners who are only driven by profit would just mine whichever chain is most profitable at any given time, the rest would mine whichever fork they support, eventually, one chain would have more continuing support, and that would be bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:10:58

That's why you keep it on coinbase?


Pretty much every wallet has this feature.


Coinbase doesn't really offer many currencies, not sure why this is a sticking point for you. 


This has nothing to do with LN, don't worry about understanding all this, you don't need to understand the technical workings, only that using segwit means your transaction fees will be lower, and that people who don't use segwit are contributing to fees remaining high.

Because it's a subdivision. Printing larger notes is because of hyper inflation, and people needing larger denominations.

It hit an ATH on the 7th and dipped and peaked a few times before the 16th.

@_date: 2017-12-28 12:27:09
Against? There aren't really any strong ones. 
Some people complain that it is needlessly complicated, but that's not actually the case, it only looks that way if you insist on ignoring all factors except block size limits on the number of transactions. Segwit wasn't actually primarily intended to address the blocksize limit, the fact that it is able to was just a nice bonus option made available to the devs due to how segwit works. 
People who only care about blocksize and transaction limits look at the way segwit allows more transactions per block, and then they say "well you could have just made the blocks bigger", and argue that because that's a simpler thing to do, that it is therefore better. This is fallacious in two ways, 1) because simple does not equal better, and 2) because segwit is actually a fix for a problem that bitcoin has called transaction malleability. Raising the block size does nothing to address this issue, it's completely unrelated. 
The other main argument you'll hear is that a plain block size limit increase should have been implemented as well as implementing segwit (a la the segwit 2X fork). This isn't really an argument against segwit, it's just an argument for a plain blocksize increase. There's no reason bitcoin can't also later have a simple blocksize increase, that isn't precluded by implementing segwit, the contentious point is **when** such a block size increase could or should be implemented. Supporters of segwit2X and Bitcoin Cash are firmly of the opinion that a blocksize increase should be implemented now. That's a perfectly valid position to take, but they failed to reach anything close to consensus, and so it didn't happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:50:48


For whatever purpose LN is used, if it is used enough at all, it will bring down on-chain fees eventually. So $30 on-chain transactions will become more viable simply because LN exists. 
Also LN requires segwit, and wider adoption of segwit will also make doing on-chain transactions cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:03:35

Especially the alt-coins that offer literally nothing different to bitcoin except a different block size or block time target. When segwit is widely adopted, lightning start to see use, and the first proper block size increase happens, that's when we'll get our dotcom bubble, and all the pointless alt-coins will disappear for having no purpose. 
I personally expect only those that serve different niches to stick around. I can see Bitcoin, and monero surviving, and possibly ether but I have a personal bias against ethereum that I readily admit. The rest will need to make major changes to become relevant or will fail.

The point you're missing is: who is "we"?
If you look at the consensus, the proof of work, the adoption, the answer is: not enough people to justify deploying that change on the primary bitcoin blockchain. 
Many people are quick to trot out the argument that Bcash cleaves closest to the spirit of the original bitcoin paper, but one of the key innovations that lies at the core of bitcoin, is proof of work bases consensus. The idea that a fork with such minority support is the 'true' bitcoin, is plainly and directly incorrect, on this basis.

There aren't many businesses that accept payment in btc anyway, but if we assume they don't have minute to minute fluidity in their pricing, it could be a good way for them to hedge against general movements over days/weeks vs the price of their goods. 
Though given the state of btc right now I full expect any outlet selling goods or services for btc has a completely flexible pricing system that just varies the btc price based on the exchange rate to whatever fiat the vendor prefers.

Then they can choose not to route transactions. It's not a requirement, most lightweight clients probably won't even expose the option, or if they have it, it won't be enabled by default, not least because to support it you need multiple channels open, which a regular user may not open anyway.

You don't have to create a channel for every single transaction or merchant. You just need a small number of channels with any random nodes on the network.

@_date: 2017-12-04 13:57:18
In simple terms a blockchain is a big ordered, timestamped database of things. You could put whatever you want in a blockchain, but for bitcoin specifically, the system is self-sustaining because it's money that's in the blockchain, transactions specifically, and you get paid some of that money for helping to work on the blockchain (mining). If you had a different blockchain, for example records of when maintenance was performed on an aircraft, that introduces a lot of new challenges, you need to incentivise people to work on the blockchain, how, without a cryptocurrency? You need to have it be decentralised, otherwise people could just re-write the blockchain to be whatever they want if there isn't a varied and distributed set of miners, how would you get this without a cryptocurrency to pay the miners for doing this? 
The following is my opinion: 
People who try to tell you that 'blockchain' is the important part, and that bitcoin is unimportant, that a blockchain is somehow greater than bitcoin, are wrong, and they either don't understand how bitcoin works, or they're upset that they missed out on the early success of bitcoin and have an axe to grind, and would like to see bitcoin fail so they can get in on the ground floor of some other blockchain-based thing. 
Bitcoin uses a blockchain. That blockchain is very important for making bitcoin work, but it's not the only thing that's very important, and bitcoin is more than just its blockchain, bitcoin encompasses other technological solutions, as well as a philosophy to money and financial activity, and that last part, the philosophy, it what makes bitcoin the important thing. Anyone can make an alt-coin, anyone can make any kind of software they want that uses a blockchain as its database, but if those things don't share the principles that bitcoin is designed towards, then they are something else, and their value can only be judged on what they actually are. 
Bitcoin is a social movement, and the technologies that underpin it are democratised and generic - they are multi-purpose, like building blocks. The value of a house is not 'does it have bricks'? yes or no, it's how well it was built, where, with what design and functional features.

I'm not even sure what you're getting at? Do you mean the segwit soft fork? That's required because it fixes a problem with bitcoin (transaction malleability), and lightning couldn't work until that problem was fixed. 
There's no contention that the technology can work, what takes time is writing the code, testing it, and getting people to adopt it.
As for 'shoe-horning', that's the wrong way to look at it. LN is a 2^nd layer system, it's meant to be. It isn't being shoe-horned onto bitcoin, it is extending bitcoin, and any other cryptocurrency that wants to support it.

Bitcoin uses the blockchain to implement one of its features. Blockchain isn't the only technology needed for bitcoin to work. The blockchain prevents double spending, but double spending is the issue - because we're talking about a currency. You can't just have any old thing as the reward for mining a blockchain. Miners want to get paid, they need an incentive to mine, if you don't have a currency for your blockchain, you need something else.

the limiting factor for LN is bandwidth and processing power between nodes, which for modern computers vs the data size of a transaction, will be negligible for a long time. 
LN would have to get real popular real fast to have any kind of congestion issues.

Not everyone is required to route other people's transactions, so the unbalanced channels are not a problem for purchases who just want to send LN payments. 
For nodes/hubs that do offer to route payments, they will likely have multiple channels, and distribute their funds reserved for routing transactions evenly among them. It will be an implicit feature of the routing logic that routes will be chosen where the channel balance is sufficient to support to transaction in a particular direction. For a hub with many channels, this means that over time, whenever one of their channels becomes weighted too much in one direction, future transactions are more likely to be routed through those channels in the other direction.

OK, so say tomorrow we quadruple the block size. All these people too lazy to switch to adopt segwit are going to jump over to the new fork right away?
Have all the normies and noobs switched to bitcoin cash? No... they haven't. 
Bitcoin is not ready for regular users who don't understand the tech yet. We need them to get hurt, have a bit of a dip, and for them to fuck off for a while until bitcoin has a real solution in place to handle that sort of scale. 
Maybe when a majority of the network is using segwit, LN is live, and we have the first consensus blocksize increase, maybe then it'll work, but these get-rich-quick buy-ins from people who don't actually give a shit about bitcoin, they aren't sustainable, they need to either not happen, or they need to precipitate big crashes, to self-correct.
It's fun to meme about ATHs, but it doesn't actually help if they aren't real.

So, If the network looks like this: 
    A--B--C
Then yes, A can send payments to C, via B. the dotted lines are channels, A sends a transaction to B via channel AB, and encoded in it is some metadata asking B to make an onward transaction to C via channel BC. B would have to at some point, in some way (probably via an option in their client software) agree to act as an intermediary for transactions. If B doesn't want to route transactions for other people, this wouldn't work.


Closing 1 channel cooperatively only requires publishing 1 bitcoin transaction on the blockchain, yes. It's just the most recent representation of the state of the channel. If AB was opened with 0.5BTC from A and from B, but A sent 0.1BTC to B, B now has 0.6 and A has 0.4, so the closing transaction would send 0.6 to B, and 0.4 to A, from the multisig address created when the channel was opened. That transfer of 0.1BTC from A to B could represent one transaction, or it could represent hundreds of transactions back and forth, that have resulted in that balance.


yes. Channels are created with a set amount of bitcoin committed to them, if A and B open a channel with 0.5BTC each, and B and C open a channel with 10BTC each, if C wants to send 5BTC to A, they can't, because the channel AB doesn't have enough bitcoin in it to do that. 
It would require there to be more, other channels also with a route to A from C, such that split between all the routes used, there was enough total capacity to carry the desired transaction.

So long as you do more than 2 lightning transactions for each channel you open, you'll be saving money on fees, since Lightning fees are so much cheaper than on-chain fees. If you do just 2 per channel, you still essentially break even. 
In the long run, on-chain and LN tx fees may converge somewhat, but it's highly likely that lightning fees will always be significantly lower than on-chain fees due to the fact that there's no pow-mining involved, and no block limit.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:43:31


If that suits your usage pattern for the lightning network, sure.

If you're super paranoid, you can generate a seed yourself, and then import it with your ledger. Even just setting it up once, then setting it up again and seeing that it gives a different seed should go some way to reassuring you that it isn't be done in a way that the manufacturer has fixed, though they could have gone to that level of effort I suppose. 
You're right though, you take on a level of risk in trusting the manufacturer of a hardware wallet, but that risk is mitigated by their exposure and incentivisation not to rob all of their customers. (It would have to be an exit scam, sacrificing their business. Also jail time, fines, being legally compelled to return stolen funds etc.)

If you can fit more tx in one block, competition is lessened, i.e. there's a greater 'supply' of tx per unit time. Also, this means people who aren't using segwit still benefit from reduced fees, and fees should keep going down until they settle at some new equilibrium based on a large majority of user switching to segwit. This is academic of course, and increased adoption may indeed drive tx volume up and the reduction in fees might not seem too noticeable. We'll have to see. Still, fees will be lower than they otherwise would have been without segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:02:52

How much you can receive would be the sum of balances of all nodes you have channels open with that are willing to relay transactions. So in practice, and in the beginning, absolutely it will be hard to send/receive large sums to/from single nodes, but over time, that limit might increase, as adoption goes up, and more capital flows into the network.
But for the foreseeable future, a more efficient option for employers is to pay all of their staff in a single on-chain transaction with multiple outputs.

decentralisation is a good thing. I would suggest that you do some reading up on what it means in the context of bitcoin. 
Segwit doesn't make bitcoin less safe. I can't give you a simple explanation as to why, because understanding why requires you to understand how bitcoin works, and what segwit is. If you do some reading up on this, hopefully you'll see that segwit in no way makes bitcoin 'less secure'. (You also need to define what you mean by secure to make the point meaningful, secure against what?).

Why are you focusing on blockchains?

Right, but there's an inherent unfairness to investing. Only rich people can invest. And the richer you are, the more you can invest. And if you're at the top tier, you get to start bending and breaking rules to make even more money from your investments. 
At least without having to worry about inflation, in theory, those who don't care to use money as a means to make more money can opt out and let investors just do their own thing. With an inflationary currency I have to try to play the game otherwise I lose money just because each unit of that money is always getting less valuable.

Well the CME is a US based regulated exchange, and not only is it illegal to do what you describe generally, the CME also specifically has rules against it. 
With the amounts at stake (it seems the minimum unit on CME is 5BTC), I would not expect anyone to take that risk, especially not institutional investors. 
Also the demand/interest in BTC right now will make it very hard to cause a price dip by 'dumping'. The market is full of people who will buy whatever you sell at current prices, and probably more still after the price goes up.
The only way to win shorting bitcoin right now is to correctly guess when dips will come naturally.

You close it anyway, but you have to wait a day for it to go through. That time delay is something that is agreed upon when you open the channel though, so you could open a channel with another node and agree to a very short timeout, or a very long one, depending on the relationship to that node, and your intended purpose for using the LN. A longer timeout is more secure, in that it gives both nodes longer to confirm that the other node closed the channel with the correct distribution of funds, but a lower timeout gives convenience, so someone with more time-sensitive requirements for access to their funds on the bitcoin blockchain, might prefer that.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:44:33
When you connect the ledger, and open the bitcoin app, it should ask you whether you want to open a regular or segwit wallet. You can do both, so next time, if you choose segwit, it will make a segwit wallet, but your other funds are still in your other wallet. Get a receive address from the segwit wallet, make a note of it, then re-launch the app and select your old regular bitcoin wallet, and send to the new segwit address. 
Also, as suggested, you can be more efficient by using your new segwit address as a second recipient next time you do a transaction.

Well for one it's way more private. Nobody on the LN needs to know who you're even sending money too. It is also very fast. You might be misled into thinking your credit card transactions are settled instantly because it seems that way when you use it in a store, but it's actually not, and charges can take hours or days to be processed. There's also a high cost to merchants in accepting card payments. For the existing system, this is often hidden from customers. With cryptocurrencies, the sending party pays the transaction fee. This might sound unfair compared to using a payment card now, but in the long run the costs will be less, as the cost of paying for those fees is baked into the price of goods and services, and also any fees or concessions you have to make to your bank/cc provider for the ability to pay using their card (withdrawal/transaction limits, monthly fees, overdrafts, giving all your money to the bank so they can invest it and make money off it). You also have no privacy whatsoever with a typical bank account or cc. They need all your person details, ID, address, they see all activity on your card, thus they can track where you are/where you've been, and just for fun, go out and fill up your car with gas, then buy a pair of sneakers/trainers, see if your account gets frozen. Oh, and we didn't even talk about international transfer fees!

The idea of lightning is that if enough merchants use it, you wouldn't need to 'cash out', you'd just keep funds in a lightning wallet to pay for various things using LN. 


The network topology doesn't matter. so long as you have a route through the network to the party you intend to pay, it doesn't matter how you're connected, maybe your entry point to the network is a 'hub' (have to be careful because a lot of people imply an awful lot with this word that isn't guaranteed), or maybe your entry point is just some random store you bought something from last week. Maybe you have 500 channels, to 500 random other LN participants, maybe you just have a channel with your friend Dave. 


Once you have no/low funds on your side of a channel, the only way to change that is to receive payment to that channel. Otherwise, yes you will likely need to open a new channel to get more funds onto the network.

No. Channels are 'smart' contracts (I hate this term but it's what everyone calls it so...), between the two participants (in practice, your software client, and mine). These contracts are essentially scripts, which use the blockchain to create a set of transactions which fund the channel, and also create a set of transactions which are not immediately broadcast (someone correct me if I'm wrong, I'm not 100% on this), there is a complicated cryptographic arrangement that basically makes it so that at any point, either participant in the channel can submit one of these transactions to the bitcoin blockchain, which would transfer the money from the channel, to the two parties, in some distribution. Both participants give each other a key which let's them send the whole channel contents to themselves, but whoever tries to do that first loses, because then the other person can submit their own similar transaction which trumps the first. The way it works when nobody is trying to scam anyone is that the channel is a multi-sig address, and both parties need to agree to close the channel and send the correct balances to each participant. The crypto is complicated, I'm reading up on it, but this is genuinely innovative stuff, so despite having a degree in computer science, this is completely new to me. 
The 'smart' contract, and all the data for the channel is stored by the participants I believe, not sure if any data is also distributed throughout the LN (anybody know this?). 
There's no miners. Transactions are like tor connections. At each hop through the network, the tx data has another layer of encryption added, so each node can only decrypt and see the part that tells them the next hop to send the tx to, they don't know if that's the final recipient, or if the next layer of encryption will contain instructions for that next node to send the tx on further still. At each stage, transactions are settled instantly, per channel. I haven't yet read deeply into how each channel hop confirms that the transaction they're passing along is correct. Like I said, it's new tech, and quite complicated.

I had a snarky chicken vs egg thing all typed out, but I'll just give you a fair answer: yes, on-chain bitcoin transaction fees are high right now, nobody disputes this. Does that really change anything regarding LN? No, not really. No matter what the cost of on-chain transactions, if you do just 2 lightning network transactions with an open channel, you've save yourself basically 50% in fees, because otherwise you would have had to make 2 on-chain transactions. And now if you realise that, you can then see why people would start to use the LN, and as people use the LN, that's more and more people no longer using the main blockchain for every single transaction, thus reducing congestion on the main chain, bringing down fees. Also, as more and more people use the LN, LN fees will also tend very low, and if you allow your node to relay transactions you may even be able to cover the cost of your own tx fees with the fees you earn from relaying other people's transactions.
Further to all this, lightning isn't reserved just for bitcoin. Anyone can implement the lightning protocol for any cryptocurrency if they want to. Once other cryptocurrencies also have LN clients, you can exchange one crypto for another on the LN, without having to use an exchange, which means fewer people making fewer blockchain transactions to move money to/from exchanges.

As long as the exchange rates are fair and accurate, it actually makes very little difference. Though right now, if you don't already have an active account with funds on an exchange, getting your money in and out of btc might take some time, but academically, if you settle your contract with accurate btc/usd exchange rates, then it makes no difference, the long position holder can just buy btc with the cash they get from settling the future. 


It is, but so would be an in-specie settled future. Investing in bitcoin or a derivative purely based on speculation as to whether it will go up or down in value, is gambling.

To manipulate the price by actually dealing btc, they'd have to find someone to buy/sell every satoshi they want to move... so the market pressure would be pretty balanced. Right now all that happens if someone wants to buy a very large amount of BTC is they struggle, because so does everyone else, so a) they can't even get their money into BTC easily, and b) that just pushes the price up, and a short will only work in their favour if at some point the demand to buy bitcoin in the market genuinely subsides, in which case they would have made a profit on a short anyway, without having to break the law and risk millions of dollars buying bitcoin.

This will be a question answered by the user interface of whatever software you use to access the lightning network. 
One possible approach is to present to the user a lightning-wallet, possibly independently, or possible as an add-on feature of a bitcoin wallet, into which they must place funds for use on the lightning network, and then give them some sort of input when setting it up as to how long they plan to keep the funds, whether they want to act as a relay for transactions in exchange for fees, how often they might want to add more funds etc, and give some sort of feedback as to what sort of fees that might bring overall.

Channel owners can close the channel whenever they want. If they agree on closing it, it happens right away. If they disagree, there are mechanisms to enforce the correct distribution of funds, and a timeout that means after a set amount of time with one channel participant not being online, it will close and funds will be distributed correctly.
So, no limit if everyone agrees, and a time limit if one party doesn't agree.

It does increase the block size limit for systems running the segwit code. Your problem is you seem to need to assign some malicious intent to this, or how it was done.
It was done because the possibility was opened up by segregating signature data, and it provided benefit, and was adopted through consensus as a result. It was a sensible, efficient way to do that, which came about incidentally, and a majority of the network agreed to adopt it.
That's bitcoin's approach to consensus. A small minority coming along and trying to strongarm the majority into making a change they want is not the same. Segwit on the other hand enabled a way to increase block size without a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:07:13


I agree, that's why I think right now, that businesses should only consider using bitcoin if it makes sense for their risk appetite, and probably only for low value transactions, which the lightning network lends itself well to, but especially so in these early days. That said, I don't believe that a desire to convert btc to usd should factor into designing bitcoin features. You can already exchange btc to usd, bitcoin and apps built on bitcoin, don't need to address that.

what sidechains are you talking about?
segwit is a change to how witness data is handled by bitcoin. **The** bitcoin blockchain.


I think you mean to say 'centralizaing', not 'decrentralizing'. And yes, any change that increases the blocksize or processing time in any way adds a new restriction on how many people, in theory, can run a node on their hardware. That's the trade-off, but if the number of people who can validate the blockchain is large enough, it might be acceptable to increase the blocksize or processing time in some way, so for example, every few years, as computers get more powerful, maybe it's acceptable to increase how hard it is to validate new blocks, or how much space/bandwidth, because people's hardware or internet connections, on average, can deal with a little bit more work.

For any scaling solution to bring down fees, its adoption has to be enough to beat out the increased demand for on-chain transactions. I agree, and I readily admit that in general, and especially in the early days, adoption will be the single most important limiting factor for LN. However, just like with segwit, adoption takes time. It is entirely possible that LN gets adopted fairly widely, but that bitcoin usage grows so much, and demand for on-chain transactions (assuming there's actually a sensible use case for doing so many on-chain transactions) gets so high that fees are as high or higher than they are now. But the alternative - not having the lightning network, would mean that in that same scenario, fees would be even higher still, and only a small proportion of people would be able to get transactions through quickly. This alone, I believe, will drive adoption of the LN for any use case where it can work, because LN transactions are near-instant. They don't just compete with on-chain transactions, they're much faster. 




So they can do it once. Like I said, the LN is resilient to this problem. It's no different to if your internet connection cuts out, making it so you can't maintain your channels, even if you want to. LN is designed to work in the face of this problem. 


LN fees will tend to the marginal cost of operating a Lightning node. If highly connected hubs will accept a fee which is just enough to cover their running costs, that's ok, that's what will happen anyway. Also, it is possible that a person could offset or even cover their own costs by operating a smaller node/hub. I did a rough calculation, with a massively over-estimated size for the average transaction, and figured my home internet connection can support about 60-ish transactions per second. I'm already beating the main bitcoin blockchain if I operate a node. If lots of network participants operate hubs, there's no reason we'd need to rely on any special node to do lots of the work. 


The challenge with on-chain transactions is that there will always be a tension between the size of the blocks, and the demand for transactions. Bigger blocks will increase the capacity for the blockchain to process transactions, and thus bring down fees. Over the next 30+ years the bitcoin blockchain will increase its blocksize multiple times (through consensus, with replay protection). **But** you can't just increase the block size limit whenever you want. Even if you ignore the issues of decentralisation, the growth in popularity of bitcoin, and demand for transactions, will always be capable of exceeding what's possible with a fixed block size. This is why there should be no arguments of segwit vs block size increase (ignoring that segwit is an effective block size increase), and there should be no question of lighting vs something else. We need every and all type of scaling solution. Optimisations that allow more txs per block - yes, we need those. Block size increases - yes, need those too. 2^nd Layer systems - also need these. 3^rd layer, wtf is this? I don't know, but we'll need those too when someone invents one, because bitcoin, or any other crypto, could get that popular. 


I get it, yeah, I make that assumption too, sorry for that. It's just, there are a lot of people who don't understand the tech, but insist on making very strong, emotional arguments about this issue, and they don't mind being rude or saying ridiculous things to 'win' the argument, and it's very draining to deal with that.

It's not really an insult, but people who think bitcoin cash should replace bitcoin get upset because they want people to just call bitcoin cash 'bitcoin' and completely usurp bitcoin. 
It betrays a very basic misunderstanding (or lack of effort to even try to understand) how bitcoin works. Bitcoin operates and changes using consensus. If only some small percentage of participants in the bitcoin network agree to a change, it doesn't happen, or it needs to happen as a fork, and then the people who want that change get to go off and do their own thing without a majority of bitcoin users being forced to follow the desires of a small minority.

First off, if there are 7.5 million lightning channels at any point, that's an astronomical success, and will mean there exists a robust and large network, which will reduce the transaction load on the bitcoin blockchain. Remember, you don't have to close channels if you don't want. Of the channels opened per each unit of time, some will remain open for the next unit of time, and eventually the network will grow in total size.
As for larger blocks, absolutely bitcoin will have larger block. Segwit increases the effective block size, so as it gets adopted, blocks will grow in size and reach some new equilibrium at a larger average value than today. Then hopefully we'll see schnorr signatures be implemented, which will reduce the size of some transactions, allowing more to fit in each block. I would expect, that once segwit and schnorr sigs are widely adopted, and we see how fees look, in the face of the multiple influences of segwit, lightning, schnorr sigs and overall adoption of bitcoin, there will likely be a much stronger consensus over an increase to the block size limit. And it will be a sensible time for it.

Like I said, in practice, end users (that includes businesses) shouldn't have to think in these terms. Which node the channel is with doesn't matter very much, a participant moving more money might want more channels open, but they could easily be obfuscated as some preference for high volume, or stability, much in the same way most wallets obfuscate transaction fees behind "slow, normal, fast", because the average user shouldn't need to think about blockchain, mempool etc. 


It doesn't have to be random, it just probably won't be based on identity. Likely metrics would be uptime, reliability, we could have complex metrics that take channel btc capacity+node bandwidth+latency and produce some single 'suitability' score to load-balance based on that, to distribute activity as evenly as possible, and we may see an overlay feature or even a future feature incorporated into the LN whereby nodes can signal their preference for the lifetime of a channel, or even have smart contracts that enforce a minimum lifetime, or a maximum. This stuff isn't a done deal, this is all new, rapidly evolving tech.


The LN is designed so that nodes relaying transactions do not know the details of the transactions they're relaying. This is an all-or-nothing design choice, if that's a deal breaker for your use-case or preference, unfortunately there's no answer for that.

Just because some nodes see more activity than others, doesn't make the network centralised. The network can function just fine with lots of channels between nodes all with small amounts of btc, it's also important to remember that any relaying node has absolutely no power to affect transactions it relays, so what you're calling centralisation isn't really the same here as when people talk about centralisation of bitcoin mining or bitcoin nodes. Those metrics I made up on a whim are only a small sample of what metrics might be important to any particular node. Maybe my client favours resilience of the network, in which case opening a channel with a node that has relatively many channels, produces a single point of failure, and my software might specifically seek to avoid that.

segwit increases blocksize, and is available for adoption right now. Until segwit is widely adopted, anyone suggesting a blocksize increase is just being ridiculous, because the effort required to switch over in the event of a hard fork is more than that required to support the segwit soft fork. And even with a larger block size, segwit still makes your transactions cheaper, so you should want both, not a block size increase without segwit.

Sure, segwit was developed for better reasons, but it also has the added bonus of allowing more transactions per block. That's not a negative.


It doesn't disallow future block size increases. Bitcoin will definitely need a block size limit in future. Segwit also does not give a minor block size increase. If everyone was using segwit right now, there would be no transaction congestion issues, that's not minor.

There's nothing inherent to Lightning that relates it in any way to micro-loans. I think is simply looking at the low transaction fees as some kind of barrier to giving micro-loans.

Bitcoin is basically still in alpha, it's too immature for people owning it to be so uninformed and uninterested. They can come back when scaling is solved, but right now, trying to leech off the media buzz just to turn btc back into fiat at a higher price, is counter productive.

Yeah, coinbase has a huge problem with that, their stockpile of BTC is so fragmented that it would actually cost them millions in fees to pay out all their customers balances because of how many inputs they'd have to consolidate. Some people suspect they may not even be able to afford it. 
Schnorr would be a godsend for them, because it would alleviate the spectre (albeit very unlikely) that they would be crippled if a large enough portion of their customer base tried to withdraw their btc all at once.

Amazon has as much incentive for their connection to the LN to be resilient too. If they want to receive payments via the LN, they won't want a single point of failure either. 
Large business will probably have a lot more open channels than a typical user, for precisely this reason. 


What power? The only power they'd have would be the power to not exist anymore, and the whole point of the LN network is it is supposed to be distributed and widespread enough that it doesn't rely on single providers for the capacity it needs, and it won't. It will take a while for adoption to reach the point where it's that resilient, but there are millions of bitcoin users, and they all want lower fees, so they'll all be incentivised to use the LN when it makes sense for a particular use case.

It's not even really about racing. It's not about who gets there first, it's about what they 'say'.

We'll have to agree to disagree. This seems highly unlikely to me. 
It seems there's a lot of misunderstanding around LN, and I kind wish I could explain it better, but I think perhaps seeing it for real will help people understand it better in practical terms. A lot of the technical concepts behind it don't help build a picture of how or why it will work from an end user's perspective, and because those technical details deal in the moment to moment minutiae of transactions and channels etc, it gives a misleading impression that end users will have to be thinking in those terms, but in practice they probably won't.

It can't do a high tps, **today** (which is not even true, it can, people are just choosing not to adopt segwit, and wallet developers and exchanges have been lazy and waited to long to update their software).
Anyway, my point was that bitcoin isn't done yet. Currently it can support a certain volume of transactions, more if segwit is adopted, and will continue to grow its capacity over time as new features are added, which will almost certainly include plain block size limit increases. The important point is when.

If enough of them stopped all at once, it could 'die'. If the difficulty is so high that it takes thousands of asic mining groups around the world to find blocks, and enough of them stop, then it could take hours or days just to find one block, which would immediately destroy the price of bitcoin.

I get a bit giddy trying to think about what the actual costs are. It's basically just bandwidth costs, which are nothing for such tiny amounts of data you'd be sending via LN.

Lightning is an open standard. Anyone can produce software that interacts with the Lightning network. 
Right now there are 3 different projects underway to develop clients. I'm always wary of talking about 'official' when it comes to anything related to bitcoin. Those projects can reach their own self-decided launch date/state, but at any point, anyone is free to use the lightning protocol, nothing is really 'official', lightning is 'out' in a sense right now. Anyone could start using the lightning protocol to create channels and send bitcoin and settle those channel's balances on the main bitcoin blockchain, all that's needed is for the software to be written, by anyone.

I suspect if the price ever gets to the point where ~5k sats is worth some meaningful amount, so, maybe when bitcoin is comfortably above $1m, then miners would alter their configs to accept transactions with outputs that small, but we're a long way from bitcoin being above $1m, and even then, how often do you need to send someone less than 5 cents? Also it'll be cheaper to just do that via lightning, which already supports sending people arbitrarily small amounts, even less than 1 satoshi.

No, this isn't really right. You don't need to open a channel for every transaction you want to make. Once the network reaches a sufficient size, each participant only needs 2 random channels to be able to transact with anyone on the entire network. 
The most successful and popular clients will likely hide completely the creation/closing of channels or with which node your channels are connected. It's unimportant, just like when you fire up tor, it doesn't really matter which 3 relays your connection goes through.

You can always rebalance a channel that you've used to send, by sending to yourself on that channel, since the fees are so low.

All scaling solutions can only be measured against the current level of demand for transactions. Saying that future adoption will bring higher demand for transactions in the future is equally an argument against all scaling solutions other than an unlimited blocksize.

The use case for lightning is not to send single transactions and then close the channel. 
If you make 2 or more lightning network transactions, you save money vs on-chain transactions, and every lightning transaction you make is one less transaction that didn't have to happen on-chain, reducing the on-chain tx demand.

I'm not sure what you mean by 'the whole point'. I was replying to a comment about an absurdly high theoretical level of adoption of the lightning network. Lightning requires no further improvements to bitcoin in principle, scale is simply a question of the level of adoption at any given time. That an insanely high level of LN adoption would require a lot of scaling of the base bitcoin protocol, is not an argument against the LN, nor does it change the fact that the LN enables a huge amount of scaling for certain use cases, vs not having it at all.
And just to be clear, the hypothetical I was responding to is one in which we're essentially suggesting that bitcoin itself is being used by a number of people that would be almost certainly higher than the current population of the world (I think it's unreasonable to suggest the LN will be used for more than 79% of all bitcoin transactions).

LN is not the only thing that will ever bring down on-chain fees, but it will. If you don't believe this, so what? doesn't matter. Do what you want. Use litecoin, or bitcoin cash, or vertcoin. Nobody is saying you can't, nobody is stopping you. Put your money where your mouth is, if you truly believe in what you are saying.


Any participant in a channel can close it whenever they want. The system is designed to allow this. Even if they try to close the channel and take all the money in it, the system is resilient to this, and nobody would ever open a channel with a node that did this.
I reject the notion that everyone will want to use 'hubs' or that a hub is inherently malicious. Nothing about the Lightning protocol makes it so that a hub is a problem, if there are lots of hubs which are nuisances, people just won't open channels with them. Even in the worst case scenario, uncooperative nodes are not particularly damaging. If you can only see the doom and gloom, fine, then when Lightning is released, don't use it.  Nobody can make you, but you'll benefit anyway, if you use any coin, not just bitcoin, that supports lightning, because on-chain fees for all coins which support lightning will come down as a result of people using lightning to move that coin around.

I don't really have a good way to benchmark, but with high core, high clock speed processors being pretty common these days, and the stagnant nature of internet upload speeds provided to residential/private customers, then even if cpus are the limiting factor now, I doubt they will be for long. 
Most of the verification of signatures is very simple operations, it's only the hashing that's time-onerous, which would be 3x 256 hashes per payment (1 input [the channel multi-sig wallet], 2 outputs [channel partner's close-out payments], for the channel state transactions, right?). If we really conservatively imagine the overhead of the rest of the validation accounts for 30% (highly unlikely), then worst case we could say a mid range quad core cpu could easily do ~300k verifications per second. Compared with my home broadband, which is 20Mbps upload, for 1.4kB payments, then we're looking at a throughput on the order of 1-2 thousand payments per second.

I still don't see their position. Their plan seems to be to replace their current wallet with a version that supports segwit, which doesn't make sense because people with existing wallets need to migrate. 
The logical thing to do is to just have the app allow you to create legacy or segwit wallets, and people can just transfer their funds from their old wallet to a new segwit one - like how ledger does it. 
It sounds like they've decided that they only want to release one big update to their app, which I get if they're short on manpower, but schnorr sigs are a while away, and segwit is needed now, and other wallets are supporting it, so if they take too long, people will just migrate to other apps that support segwit.

If the rich paid anywhere close to the taxes they're currently supposed to, we'd be drowning in well educated children, well kept roads etc. 
I don't personally believe in lowering taxes much, but there is a decent point underneath the ideological posturing, which is that currently the tax system is broken and on paper, if everyone paid the tax the law says they're supposed to, that would be way too much. The only reason we can't deal with it on those terms is because so many people are dodging their tax obligations, mostly rich individuals and large companies.

Nothing you said is incorrect. I'm just not sure what you think the problem is.
If you make just 2 LN transactions for every channel you open, you save money vs on-chain transactions. Almost 50%.
As for centralisation, centralisation isn't a problem for LN, I suggest reading up on how LN works. Having lots of open channels doesn't confer any power on a person, worst case scenario they don't hold them open very long, at which point, other participants in the network who want to open long-lifetime channels will just not open a channel with them.

The hype is due to uninformed laymen not realising that all crypto is a work-in-progress, and in fairness with a high rate of change at that. 
non-technical observers are both impatient, and under the false assumption that bitcoin is a finished thing, when in actual fact, by traditional software development standards it can barely be considered alpha software, and the only reason it isn't looked at that way is because so many people have started using it for real while it's still under such active development.

I agree. But if you want to use a network, at some point you have to connect to it. If you don't, you aren't using it. This is just plain semantics, the meaning of these words. I don't see what your issue is here. LN doesn't promise a solution to sending bitcoin without an internet connection.


Here lies the crux of your difficulty.


This question makes no sense. These words don't describe the process that takes place. 


This concept doesn't make sense. transactions are uni-directional on the LN. If A sends money to B, that's a tx. If B wants to send money back to A, that's a new tx.


'anymore' needs to be unpacked more - we're talking about time periods of milliseconds, between a route being decided upon and then used. If a node goes offline at precisely the wrong millisecond, then yes, that transaction would fail. The specific algorithm for retrying the transaction, I'm not familiar with, mainly because that's settled technology at this point. 


I answered this question already.


This is actually a good point. I don't know exactly what will happen in the future. I don't see that as a reason for LN not to exist. Worst case scenario the country you live in outlaws its use, that sucks for you, and people in your country learn from that and move on as they see fit.
The rest of the world, I suspect, will carry on using it until something better comes along.


As I've explained, there's no real incentive to operate a 'major hub'. The transaction fees will tend to the base cost of infrastructure required per transaction, which will be extremely low. Operating a LN node purely to collect fees and to not actually use the network, may on paper, lose you money overall. As to capitalization, if the network adoption is sufficiently widespread, then this is actually not a problem, for a detailed explanation of this, see this article: 
@_date: 2017-12-28 21:51:19
This makes no sense. 
If the block size gets increased, it gets increased. Just because the mechanism by which that size increases has some measure of backward compatibility doesn't make it 'not count'. (what does 'not count' even mean in this context. You think segwit transactions don't really happen?)
@_date: 2018-09-26 21:20:12
I think the idea is you aren't supposed to be shuffling money to and fro. A mainnet sidechain is meant to be taken seriously, and once coins are locked to the sidechain, you're subject to the rules of the sidechain about removing those funds from the sidechain, because we're essentially talking about the supply. 
It's not as drastic as burning btc, but from the perspective of the sidechain, which may need a reasonable guarantee of supply and liquidity, it is almost like burning coins,  so taking funds out of the chain back to mainnet should be hard.

That's not how this works. 'no counterparty risk' means nobody can steal funds you haven't agreed to send to someone else. Once you've sent funds to someone else (i.e. lent them), they aren't yours anymore, and the LN gives you no way to recoup those if the recipient doesn't honor some separate contractual agreement you have with them.

Nope, bitcoin and LN are trustless. 
Bitcoin transactions are immutable (unless someone pulls off a successful 51% attack), and LN channels are set up so that if someone tries to close a channel with you at anything other than the current correct state of the channel, you are able to (or rather, your client can) take the entire channel balance. 
That last part is actually quite hard to understand, it is based on some pretty cool cryptography. This talk touches on it:

Yep, so many wallets just go with what everyone else is using, even though fees of hundreds less sats per byte will confirm in a handful of hours. 
Very few people need their transactions to confirm faster than that, but are paying the fees to get 30-60 minute confirmations for no reason. 
Unless I *need* bitcoin in a different wallet right away, I default to about 30 sats per byte, and even when everyone is complaining about high fees, my transactions never take more than a day to complete, which is still better than you'd typically get with inter-bank transfers.

Then the latest state of the channel would be resolved on the blockchain.

The killer LN app will be the first to enable cheaper purchasing or transacting models without presenting the machinations of the LN to the user.
Imagine, for example, if you could: 
1. set up a LN client
2. add a balance (transfer in some btc which is transparently used to set up a few channels)
3. pay for something on amazon
I could see mainstream wallets just adding this feature. You could have your main BTC wallet, and then your lightning pocket, or lightning purse or whatever, where you put some funds for retail or recurring transactions. 
To the user, this would be just like another wallet, or a wallet add-on, where you put your 'spending money', and the heavy lifting would be done by the client, invisible to the user, and so long as a merchant maintained a handful of LN channels, they could receive payments through the LN. It needs to work for dummies, and it can. It's just that at the moment, of course people are just talking about the tech, because that's all there is right now, so people are locked in, eyeball-touching the core concepts. But in practice, an average user doesn't need to understand what CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY means, or how to open/close a channel using the cli. They just need to know that they put money in, they send/receive to/from other people using the LN, and if someone tries to futz with their money, then their client, or someone else on the network, will fix it and they'll win some extra money. (which will also never happen unless someone finds a vulnerability in the watchtower functionality.)

The comment you're replying to is poorly worded. The LN client software would have access to your part of the key material for the multi-sig wallet used for the channel.

You have described relaying payments, but the question is, in what manner does this in any way relate to micro-loans?
It does not. 
I think people are imagining features of the lightning protocol that don't exist. If you send someone money to someone via lightning, that money is now theirs. It doesn't matter that you have called it a loan, perhaps you had a conversation with the recipient via email, and agreed you would give them a loan, but there's no technical feature of lightning that enforces any kind of terms relating to that. The money is sent to the recipient, and how/when they pay back the 'loan' is not understood, facilitated, or enforced by the lightning protocol.
What people are seemingly discussing would be suited to implementation using a smart contract, using ethereum, whereby you create a contract which creates many channels, one initial one to send funds to the lendee, and then according to some pre-agreed schedule, channels are opened and used to send funds back to the lender in the future, but since the creation and closing of a channel requires an on-chain transaction, this approach is actually worse than just making repayments on-chain using a smart contract.
If you try to have the repayments all come via one channel, that means that the lender must have the full funds available at the time that channel is created, which defeats the purpose of a loan.
If you assume that there's a central lending coordinator operating a hub, then you have to ask how does this setup benefit borrowers? They cannot use borrowed funds sent over the LN without closing the channel in which they received the funds. This architecture shifts all the tx costs to the borrower, which a) sucks for them and b) could have been done more efficiently using on-chain transactions.

Is it so onerous to 'pre-fund' a debit card or pre-paid credit card?
Granted the fee structure is different, and bitcoin has it's own unique problems in that regard, but having to 'pre-fund' your payment mechanism is a very normal thing for people to do right now.

Well the 16k of yours never actually went anywhere in the first place. It is essentially held by the exchange, they also wouldn't lock up the whole 16k, only the required minimum amount. The seller would have put up some % margin as well, which would have increased a few times as the price went up during the life of the contract. You'd get 11k upon resolving the contract, and your margin back. 


I dunno, I'm biased, so my answer is: idiots. It's some stranger using the same exchange as you. I don't really see the point of your question, why do you care **who**?


For the futures available right now, that's correct, they are cash-settled only. 


That's the pattern so far, but what matter is the change in btc price during only the lifetime of the contract, not any other time scale. If you take out a long position and the price tanks for an hour and you get liquidated, then it recovers and goes up 200% over the next week, you're just as fucked as if the price stayed down.


You can do whatever you want. 


Again, these futures are cash-settled, if you decide to hedge by actually buying or selling real bitcoin, that's entirely up to you. As for bitcoin going up, that's your own personal guess, nothing more. 


The futures market offers the ability for businesses that receive bitcoin, to hedge against a drop in the price over a given timescale that makes sense for them. There aren't many other sensible use cases in my opinion, but them I'm a reformed gambler and I am heavily biased against gambling with financial instruments.

You've latched onto the word 'centralized' but you aren't engaging with what it means in each context. 
It is an important and relevant concept when discussing a pow blockchain based cryptocurrency. It is not particularly important when discussing something which is not a pow based blockchain currency. I cannot help you separate these notions, you'll simply need to go back to basics, do some reading about how mining works, how bitcoin nodes work, maybe read some articles about why centralisation is bad for bitcoin, then read about how lightning works, in the context of what you then understand about centralisation, and it should make sense. 
If you are not familiar or comfortable with cryptography, my apologies, you're going to have to get familiar and comfortable, because in each case, it is understanding the cryptographic mechanism in use which will explain and prove why centralisation is bad for bitcoin, and not really an issue for LN. 
Your points about gold are irrelevant and also mostly incorrect. But I'm not interested in rehashing why the gold market is fucked.

@_date: 2017-12-11 09:02:59
Sort of yes, but this may be offset somewhat by increased bitcoin adoption in general. Also if mining becomes less profitable, some miners will stop mining, the difficulty will go down, and thus mining will get cheaper, and profitability will settle at some new level that sustains fewer miners but is still profitable for those that remain.

If you don't mind using the extra 100% of value you've got for free from the last month's growth, you can easily afford the fees even now while things are hectic. Or if you don't need you transaction to go through in the next 10-20 minutes, you can just pay 30-40 sat/B like always and wait a few hours or until the next day.
A lot of the fee problem is caused by people who don't understand this. You only pay 300+ per byte if you need your tx to get confirmed right fucking now. A lot of people are probably paying those fees because they don't understand, or because their wallet tells them the fee to get into the next block instead of something more reasonable.

I think you're still misunderstanding the network topology. You don't need to be connected to the mattres store. Nodes that you are connected to, don't need to be connected to the mattress store. Nodes they're connected to, don't need to be connected to the mattress store, and so on, and so on.
It's like the internet. So long as there is a route, even if it takes a huge number of hops, it doesn't matter, you can still transact with anyone else on the network, however their channels meet the network, so long as they just do. 
Do a traceroute to reddit.com, see how many hops it takes. Look in your browser's dev console to see how much data is transferred, notice that, you are able to visit reddit.com, and pages load almost instantly, and also notice the volume of data is much much larger than would be needed for a LN transaction. 
For me, right now, it's 11 hops on my home internet (way more on my work connection) to reddit, and to load the front page of without using my cache I have to pull down 1.7MiB. That's huge, it went through 11 hops, and it loads instantly from a human perspective. As a safe over-estimate, lets say a LN transaction is 10x bigger than a btc on-chain transaction, say 4-5KiB, that's still **3 orders of magnitude** smaller than the front page of My home connection can do 35.8MiB/s down, and 2.38MiB/s up. To be fair, let's only work with my upstream, because that'll be saturated first, obviously. Assuming a 10x normal transaction size, I could, with my home pc and my personal internet connection, relay 47 of these hypothetical large LN transactions per second. The entire bitcoin network, in ideal circumstances, can support 6-7 transactions, total.

Nope, if you open a channel with someone, they aren't a third party. They're the only other party involved in your channel. You're thinking too small. When you want to load google.com, you don't manually seek out a server that hosts google.com, you don't manually curate the route your http request will take. It will be the same with lightning. You won't need to be getting down in the weeds focusing on which node is who. It doesn't matter. It's cryptographically trustless and secure.


It can't. cryptography isn't like that. People can't just interfere with strongly encrypted data if they don't hold the private key to decrypt that data.


the blockchain isn't involved, a lightning node is just a computer with one or more lightning channels open. What happens in any one channel is agreed between the two channel partners, if you don't want to send money to your channel partner, then you just don't agree to do that. In a sense it's two-way consensus, though a little less meaningful, since most of the decisions made will be automated (relaying transactions will simply be an opt-in activity, handled automatically by the software once you've opted-in.)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:18:00
I didn't say you don't need bitcoin, I said centralisation is a problem for blockchains, but not for lightning. I didn't say Lightning can run without using bitcoin, or some other cryptocurrency as its basis. Lightning is a second layer solution. If you wanted something like lightning to not be a second layer solution, you'd have to change everything about it that assumes an underlying layer. I don't know why your mind went in this direction, it's nonsense and irrelevant.
Whatever answer I give you will be going off on an unrelated tangent, and given that you don't seem to grasp the basic difference between a blockchain, and not-a-blockchain, I don't know that it will satisfy you.

You'd have to, presumably, accept some meaningful delay, as a service that relies on closing channels to function, would want to amass batches of LN-&gt;BTC transactions and only close their channels as infrequently as possible. But even if such a service bundled just a handful of transactions from the LN to the main blockchain, then it could charge each individual sender a proportional share of the fees needed to close the channel, so the fee per tx from the perspective of the senders is 1/n compared to regular btc transactions, where n is the number of LN-&gt;BTC transactions resolved in one batch. It's actually a really cool idea, and it's not even inherently something that needs to be confined to lightning. Anyone can write their own second layers solutions for batching end user transactions up before they get settled on the base blockchain. Sensible exchanges probably already do this for customer withdrawals. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:36:00
Apologies that this is not directly related to your comment here, but you got me thinking - If a node has multiple channels open, and acts as an intermediary, in the short term, some particular channels (inbound) will end up with balances skewed towards them, and the channels they use to relay transactions onward would end up skewed towards the other participant. Would it then make sense, or at least be possible, for such a node to shuffle their own funds between their open channels, at no cost, to more evenly distribute their funds. Would this even be neccessary?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:52:58

I'll answer the LN question second, first let's jump straight to the end: eventually the mining reward will be 0, so forget about that.
Miners will only get transaction fees for mining blocks. How much will this be? Who knows, it's a long way off in the future, but if it's very small, compared to now (probably it will be), then absolutely the incentive to mine will be reduced. What this means is, for however much mining capacity is directed at bitcoin now - some of those miners will no longer find it profitable, or profitable *enough*, and they'll reduce how much mining they do, or pull out altogether. This means those that choose to keep mining bitcoin will potentially get  a larger share, as there's less competition. This could incentivise large pools, but it is generally expected that if a pool ever approaches 50% of overall mining capacity, that the operators of the pool will break up the pool. This doesn't just rely on miners having a kind heart: it is in their interest not to reach 50+% of all hashing power, because if they did, confidence in bitcoin would drop, people would be less comfortable using it, and its value would tank (and so the miner's profit would drop, because tx fees are in bitcoin, and generally are not influenced by the value of bitcoin, but the demand for transactions).


Remember, mining doesn't necessarily need lots of hashpower, as more people mine, the difficulty adjusts, the blocktime stays the same, as does the reward, the number of people mining, and the amount of hashpower in use now, is not because bitcoin is popular, there's no requirement for more hashpower to support more users. Pools only smooth out the returns for people who club together, everyone still, eventually, just gets whatever proportion of the overall hashpower they constitute. If there were a very large drop in mining power directed towards bitcoin, it may be that changes to the pow system would be needed to shore up security, but we're talking about 20+ years in the future. Bitcoin's proof of work system may change multiple times by then, it may not even use proof of work in 20 years, it might not exist, it's impossible to say. 
As for the LN, you still need to pay on-chain fees to use a channel, and LN won't be a suitable solution for all use cases. If you just want to make a single, large transaction, doing it on chain will be more efficient. Also, for most people, if they ever want to move funds into or out of the lightning network, they have to use the base blockchain to do that. So at the very very least, merchants and high-volume transaction relayers would likely want to open and close channels relatively frequently.

Socialism is a system in which the workers own everything. When people talk about the centralised national government owning enterprise and infrastructure, and call it socialism, I think that's disingenuous. Sure you can make the tenuous link that in a strong democracy workers implicitly have a say in how those things are managed, but that's not the case in most representative democracies, so the workers really have no say, and rarely see any benefit.

"Blockchain, not Bitcoin" is just sad lashing out of a greedy person who is so bitter at missing out on bitcoin gains, that they've gone into denial.
So much so they haven't even realised they could still get involved in bitcoin now and see lots of growth in the long term.
Personally, I refuse to evangelise or explain bitcoin to people who are only interested in getting rich quick. "Blockchain, not Bitcoin" people are part of this category. They don't want to understand the technology, they don't really even want to use it, they want to buy in at the start, and they can't do that for bitcoin, so they badmouth it, they're always money men, they never actually have any idea of their own about how to use a blockchain to create some new business, they want someone else to do that for them. They will tell you about all these startups they've heard of, and possibly thrown money away on, and without fail every example is of a company either making an altcoin that doesn't effectively offer anything over bitcoin, or a company claiming to use a blockchain to do something which still requires trust, or doesn't benefit from a blockchain, or can't actually work without a financial token attached to it, and so we're back to altcoins. 
People who just want to get rich quick, are not useful for the growth of bitcoin. They will not transact bitcoin, they will not pay for coffee with lightning, they will not run a node, they will not mine, they will not spread the message to others about bitcoin's strengths and weaknesses or tell other people how it works or how to use it.
These people don't deserve bitcoin. They can get involved when there's nothing left to do but use it.

It might be prudent to close your existing channels and open new ones depending on the capacity/reliability of the channel partners, it might also be common to see people take nodes down for maintenance, especially in the run-up to new versions of their software, or bitcoin core (assuming a lot of small to mid size nodes run both core and lightning on the same system).

I don't see how. If the participant who contributed 0 refuses to close the channel cooperatively, the funder of the channel can simply broadcast the pre-half-signed transaction which confirms the current distribution of funds (all of it belongs to them), and the 0-funder can't do anything, because he has no pre-half-signed txs that disagree with that state, so if the party who contributed nothing refuses to close, or their internet dies, or they get swept away by a hurricane or whatever, then the party that fully funded the channel just signs and broadcasts the pre-half-signed tx corresponding to the current state of the channel. 
A party who is unable to maintain an active connection can also be protected using the watchtower system, whereby even if they are offline, a third party also has a pre-half-signed tx which corresponds to the latest correct state of the channel, and if the channel party who remain online tries to close it out in a different state, the third party can sign and broadcast their tx, which actually gives the whole channel balance to the other party (the party who is offline) and also when a third party provides this assistance, they receive some of the channel funds as well, as a reward for enforcing the true state of the channel and preventing fraud by the malicious channel participant.

If you plan to only make one transaction, and will not perform frequent transaction with others users of the lightning network, then using a regular bitcoin transaction is more efficient.

@_date: 2017-12-28 11:45:21
Very low fees. Probably a few cents. 
Plus whatever you spend to open channels, but if you do more than 2 transactions you have saved yourself 50%+ overall (this percentage increases with the number of transactions you do per LN channel, tending asymptotically to 99.9% recurring if you do enough transactions, and assuming on-chain transactions always cost more than LN transactions in the future.)
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:19:27


That's not how that works.
You only need channels open to a small handful of other participants in the LN to transact with anyone else on the network. You don't need to open a channel with every single participant you want to transact with. 
Think of it like this: Your house doesn't have one internet connection for every website you want to browse - you have one connection, to your ISP, and they have connections to just a handful of other organisations on the internet, in most cases, none of those will be the website you want to browse either, but your connection requests are routed via these hops on the network, to get to your actual destination. 
Try not to think of channels as a payment tool, it's not one channel per transaction, channels are the backbone of the network, transactions can travel via any channel.

So there's the same market pressure in both directions... I'm not sure you can even open and close a future with CME fast enough to take advantage of the short term fluctuations this would cause if you were even successful at all.


So, nothing new... we're still up 100% vs a month ago. Dramatic price changes are not something anyone can bring to bitcoin, they're already here.

I still remember when I was 14/15 being really offended that I had to wait until I was 16 to open a bank account. Even then, there were plenty of things you couldn't do with cash, using ebay, buying xbox live gold, that sort of stuff, and it just seemed retarded that there was an age limit on having an account and a payment card. It's heartening to hear that the next generation get it, and are taking their rights and responsibilities into their own hands.

The issue I have right now is that if where I'm getting BTC from doesn't support segwit, I have to get paid to a regular wallet then move the BTC to my segwit wallet. That's annoying and doesn't save me any fees.

Other currencies have fees. And bitcoin fees will come down if people use the lightning network.

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:47:01


They can charge what they like. The constraint is market forces. If you open one channel with the intention of using that channel to route your payments into the network, and they raise their fees, you are likely to want to open a different channel, or multiple channels. So long as at least some participants in the lightning network don't try to artificially inflate fees in this way, then long term it shouldn't be a problem.


Again, market forces. So long as some people use the lightning network in good faith (i.e. not all nodes engage in fee price fixing), then that reduces the on-chain transaction load, which will bring down on-chain fees, and this will always be an effective hard upper limit on LN fees, because if on-chain is cheaper, people will just use a regular on-chain transaction. But still, LN transaction relays will be in competition with each other, and the network will route via whatever path has the lowest fees. 
I think hub reputation will be a significant factor. Hubs that don't gouge on fees will be successful, those that do, won't. I for one, will be happy to route transactions with a fee that's enough to cover my running costs.

@_date: 2018-09-07 14:06:17
But without segwit, is that even true?
Also, as the codebases diverge, and bitcoin keeps getting updates that are not replicated to bcash, it becomes less and less feasible to simply 'copy' the code.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:25:58
I'm not sure I understand the question. 
The mechanism by which channels are secured is known, and is the same for all channels. 
Are you asking if it's less secure to operate a hub/to route transactions for other people? In a sense it may be, but it will depend on how that is implemented by the various software clients released. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:53:37
Well, for starters, segwit increases blocksize, and is required for lightning, so bitcoin is actually increasing its blocksize, then lightning will come next. 
If, after wide adoption of segwit, lightning, and next year hopefully schnorr signatures, we still encounter transaction congestion (which we will, it's just a question of when), then a block size increase may be the best solution. An 8MB size, I'm not sure, maybe less, maybe more, maybe a variable size limit with some algorithm for controlling it, maybe some different approach which mitigates some of the downsides to block size increases, like 16MB blocks and sharding to decrease the load in individual validating nodes. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:58:32
more like 3.7, so if the 2X fork had gone ahead we'd be looking at closer to 7-7.4MB blocks.
but that's not important and I'm just a stupid pedant, ignore me.

I had a similar thought, struggled to come up with a good metaphor for the money that you commit to channels though, since it's hard to abstract the money you have across multiple channels, into some understandable construct that's presented as a single pool of money. Though that might work tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:15:23
To be fair, if you want to deal in 5+BTC per contract, it makes sense to do that in the relatively low-risk environment of a futures exchange vs just buying 5+BTC and seeing what happens.

The opposite view is only useful when it's informed and there's a genuine difference of opinion. has devolved into complete anti-empirical nonsense. When the 'opposite view' is denying reality when it's staring you in the face, I don't think there's much value in that. 
Plenty of things that I share my opinion on, technically and conceptually, about bitcoin, on this sub, meet disagreement, and people post comments, sometimes very passionately, explaining how they disagree. If I posted what I think on I would be downvoted to oblivion, called a sheep, and banned.

In this context, a double spend is just referring to broadcasting multiple transactions that spend the same utxo, in the hope that a merchant hands over goods to you after seeing a transaction in the mempool which pays him, but then the other transaction spending the same utxo to you, gets mined first. 
This is the inherent issue with accepting 0-conf payments. Satoshi was talking about ways to have some assurance, not bulletproof, but reasonable assurance, that a tx to you is not going to be trumped by a double spend.

He's talking long term, the ability to build a power plant and use excess capacity that would otherwise be unused, to generate income from mining, reduces the financial barrier to building a power plant in location X. Eventually, this kind of incentive would lead to having more power plants, in more varied locations, so that there's better access to energy in general.

So imagine me and you make a deal. The deal is I promise to sell you a hat, in 5 days, at the current price of hats. The trick is, I don't have the hat yet,  I need to get one over the next five days if you are actually going to expect to receive a physical hat at the end of the deal. Today, this hat costs $10.
I could go out tomorrow and buy the hat, and find out the hat store put the price up to $12. I have to buy it because we have a legal contract saying I'll sell you a hat, so I buy it for $12, and I lose $2, because I have to sell it to you for $10.
Alternatively, in 5 days, maybe I still didn't buy a hat to give you, but you say "don't worry buddy, just give me the money I need to buy the hat, and I'll go get one for myself". I agree because I don't feel like going to the hat store, so I just give you $2. We settled the future contract in cash. 
At this point you paid $10 to get 12, you've got the $12, and you think "Do I really need that hat after all?" And maybe you choose not to get the hat, or do, up to you, but our deal never had to actually involve the actual hat.

Or maybe I just keep 2-5 channels open at all times with a little btc in them, so that if I ever want to use the LN, I can.

The lesson to take from the big short is that bad debt is bad. You shouldn't lend money to someone when you know there's a high chance they won't be able to pay, and you shouldn't then lie to other people about that likelihood. It's essential fraud via a semi-legal loophole.
Crypto doesn't kill debt. People can borrow/lend crypto, and they can lend it to people they know have a high chance of defaulting. this isn't a crypto/fiat issue, it's a behaviour/morality issue.

In the short term, it's likely that Lightning clients will be standalone software, not integrated into existing wallets. I expect we'll see that 6-12 months later. (This is a completely personal speculation based on the likely demand, and the fact that lots of LN client code is open source and can thus be 'copied' to some extent by other wallet developers.)
The roadmap is nothing, lightning is a protocol, it exists now. Since Lightning is an open standard, at the moment there are 3 prominent projects underway to develop lightning clients, and each may or may not have a meaningful and public roadmap. 
What work remains is to write the software. I believe the lightning labs client is very close to being ready in their eyes, and is focused on bug testing right now. Obviously because this involves some fairly novel crypto, and people's money is at stake, they are being very cautious and want to test thoroughly before distributing their software for general use.

SPV just allows people without the technical know-how or the resources, to use bitcoin without having to run a node.

Like a jew in a concentration camp saying "aha! I don't think you should call them gas *chambers*, there must be some better word..."
Deliberate inflation, and make no mistake, it is deliberate, it is a feature of fiat-currency by design, means that anyone with savings is under artificial pressure to spend their money, lest it reduce in value and get them less in future.

Nope, you said that you can list thousands of companies that are at the top of their game, but who still have competitors. 
The truth is, in a free market, a company that's at the top of their game will genuinely push competition out. You see it in niche markets more often, because the wider impact is hidden. Someone like Bergeon for example, have a practical monopoly on watch making tools. And even Google, for a time they essentially had a monopoly on search in most of the markets where they operated. 
When a company with a product or service offering which is vastly superior to its competitors, still has competition, that means one of two things: you've missed something in your analysis of how good their offering is, **or**, something artificial is holding them back from pushing out their competition, this generally will be laws in place that prevent them from being able to achieve that, or just government coming in and levying huge fines or mandating that they seperate one of more parts of the company, to break up their monopoly.

It’s very hard to ever know, each node can only tell you how many txs per unit time they made, relayed, or received, but they also aren’t compelled to do so, which means we’re left with voluntary sampling and extrapolation, which will be very inaccurate given how much the capacity of a lightning node can vary, primarily due to amount of funds available, and upload bandwidth available.

I will never look at another internet Ad in my life. 
I have seen the worst of it, in my work, drive-by downloads through ads used to be one of the biggest infection vectors for malware. Ad networks and their customers have shirked their responsibility for basically decades now, and it's unacceptable. They are asking users to let them run code on their machines that can be changed on the fly, yet don't want to put in any effort to make sure they aren't malicious. 
On Google's side, they seem to be completely happy to allow scammers post ads, and to get profit from them, and only take things down if someone complains, which is not acceptable when you're running a platform that can put those ads as literally the first things that millions of people will see on their screens when searching the internet.

Credit unions tend be much smaller and limited to a particular area, at least they do in my country. Therefore you have many smaller points of aggregation, and even the catastrophic loss of one credit union wouldn't have much, if any, impact on others, whereas we allow mainstream banks to become too big to fail, even internationally. Centralisation isn't a binary metric. It's tiresome how many people ignorantly suggest it is, especially on this subreddit, where people ought to know better.

That's not a lot, because for me, disposable is what's left after paying all bills, rent, food, unavoidable costs, and setting money aside for a mortgage deposit. I'm also mining with 4 GPUs, and converting whatever altcoins I mine to btc. I don't like yo think in terms of the Bitcoin exchange rate, because that's only going to get worse from a buyer's perspective. I'm putting in everything I can safely put in.

So, you shorted bitcoin, based on your own independent 'reading for information', then the price went up... and you want to suggest somehow, someone was supposed to predict the future, then tell you which way the price would go, and because they didn't, you're upset? 


Wut? This makes no sense. You shorted bitcoin, and they wanted you to also settle BCH contracts? That makes no sense unless they were offering BCH contracts, and you were dealing those too? You're leaving some details out here aren't you...
Ultimately, firms like IG have big fees, you pay those fees for keeping positions open with them, whether you're winning or losing, and they aren't going to let you sit on massive losing positions without collateral, and all of this would have been in the terms you agreed to when you signed up, but you didn't read those terms did you?

It's based upon the fact that you don't sit on currency or precious metals for decades. That's not just my opinion, that's pretty much everyone's opinion. With regards to fiat, it's doubly stupid, because you know that by design, it will go down in value, and the whole point of long term investments is to make enough of a return to offset the fact that the dollars you'll get, will be worth less than the dollars you paid to purchase that investment, so it needs to have gone up in value by at least enough to cover the difference. Fiat will not do that, the whole point of it is to do the opposite. This is one of Bitcoin's key reasons for existing. To offer a currency that doesn't have inflation as a built-in feature.
As for gold, that's nowhere near as far towards the stupid end of the spectrum as hoarding fiat, but it's still a pretty shoddy long term investment. Gold is sometimes an effective short term hedge against a falling dollar, but the general long term trend for gold, adjusted for inflation, is down, not up.
So please, load up your retirement fund with gold and cash. Put your money where you mouth is? That's what I'm doing, because I say putting your retirement savings in gold and cash is a retarded idea, and so does every pension fund manager on the planet, so my money is in equities and crypto.

I think this is the part you don't get. Bitcoin doesn't need to fondle the balls of central banks. The Lion does not concern itself with the opinion of the sheep, etc. 
I do not assume that you have bought into the idea that the existing fiat currency system is supreme or deserves to be 'worked together with'. I see it. You demonstrate it. 
Bitcoin is seperate. Bitcoin does not seek to help those who support fiat. Bitcoin is an alternative. 


Bitcoin works because of financial incentive. The true genius of Bitcoin is acknowledging and designing for the fact that people will act out of self-interest. By engineering a system where individual's financial self-interest drives them to act in a way that works and supports bitcoin, there is no need to coddle anyone, there's no need for fondle balls or massage fragile egos. Bitcoin is what it is, and as and when it is financial advantageous for people to adopt it, they will. There's no reason we need to rush people who do not yet feel any pressure to use bitcoin. Bitcoin doesn't need them to adopt fast.

It's not so different from how btc transactions can sit in the mempool for an arbitrarily long time. 
Transactions don't get processed until the bank's system is ready and able to process them. Why the timings and temporal restrictions? I dunno, mostly I think they're vestiges from when humans did this stuff manually, and early software project leaders couldn't think beyond replicating existing process. You're starting to see new banks that compete in this space - stuff like Revolut, Monzo, Fire, even banks like Metro who are closer to the traditional model, but with longer opening hours, and just providing better customer service.

Well you can't modify the blockchain after the fact without recomputing the proof of work for the entire chain, so worst case scenario, you could revert to the point where 'corrupt' transactions where first added to the blockchain. It seems unlikely that such 'corruption' could persist very long without being noticed, given that bitcoin is used by a great many people, so if something was wrong with transactions going into block immediately after a fork of some kind, someone would notice.

It's similar to bitcoin, where it's a market, and users or their software might favour the use of nodes or sets of nodes (routes through the network) which have the lowest total fee. Over time this will lead to an equilibrium state where fees will settle at some minimal value, just enough that people are willing to operate nodes enough to collect some fees, but not too high that people are dissuaded from using the system. 
It's a market, very similar to how bitcoin transactions fees work now, but because there's no limitations like a block on a blockchain has (size, 10 minutes on average to process one block), there's less competition, instead of fighting over who gets their transactions in the bitcoin blockchain first, the lightning network can just route transactions via all feasible paths, to spread the workload, and since there's no mining, the computing power needed to process or relay transactions is very small compared to  normal cryptocurrency mining.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:11:20

The nice thing is it also makes bitcoin more feasible to use for the less rich. 
That's the real appeal of 'scaling', fees being high is an academic point for most people involved in crypto now, we can all afford them, it's just annoying. But lightning adoption will really allow bitcoin to be brought to the masses, and that's what we really need.

The 'so what' is that we also know the current exchange rate, and it's commonly discussed in the context of bitcoin as opposed to satoshis, because the numbers are more manageable. Anyway, the upshot is, if fidelity's customers started wanting to buy, we can see intuitively that at the kind of volumes that investors are likely to want to deal, there isn't enough to go around. Ergo, if that number of people got into bitcoin, it is reasonable to expect that to drive the price up.
Not groundbreaking by any means, but tying the numbers to things people are used to elsewhere, makes it very easy to get that perspective, and to conceptualise the scale of the effect on demand. As you rightly say, it doesn't matter the total supply, or whether you use bitcoins or milibits or sats etc, what matters is using numbers that make the effect understandable without having to pull out your calculator.

That's not how consensus works. Developers, node operators, and miners would all have to agree to such a change, otherwise you'd just be looking at a contentious fork. Changing the supply of bitcoins would only be possible via a hard fork, so you'd need everyone on board. And again, astronomically unlikely.

Caveat emptor. If someone says they'll sell you a widget for 1 mBTC, if you'd like, you can go look up the current exchange rate from the source of your choosing to evaluate the fiat equivalent amount. 
The price is volatile, but it isn't that volatile. This only takes 30 seconds max, and the price isn't going to move so much in the space of a couple of minutes that it has much of a meaningful impact on the price you pay. that's assuming we're talking about day to day commerce. If you're buying a house or a car in bitcoin, then you really should be agreeing to an exchange rate and how it will be locked in as part of negotiations, just like if you were dealing a large amount of BTC.

This is unrelated to bitcoin.
The British government is currently pushing a very nonsensical and vague argument that "technology" will address the challenges that arise from Brexit. Hammond is just throwing "blockchain" out as a buzzword, because blockchain is technology, so it sounds like he's backing up the government logic that "technology" is the answer.
Nobody in the government can tell you how, or which technology is actually going to address any particular problem. Indeed in this case blockchain had nothing to contribute regarding the NI border. The key sticking points are import taxes and the rules about what can imported. It doesn't matter what currency you use, it doesn't matter if you register all imports on the blockchain, because that doesn't answer the questions of which rules are apllied, how are they enforced, and who collects the taxes? For example, I ship millions of tons of dehydrated milk powder to NI, and I want to move it into Ireland. Right now there's no agreement about who's import tax rules will apply. Using a blockchain isn't somehow going to make the EU say "sure, just waltz across the border, we don't know what's in that milk powder, and we know you charged less import duty than we would have, but forget all that, you've got a blockchain, come on in!"

I assume this is a typo since you seem to mean to say that it is.
Are you talking about the fact that people talk about the price of bitcoins as opposed to the price of satoshis, or milibits etc? That, I will agree with you, semantically, is arbitrary. Or well, using bitcoins is. Once bitcoin is valued highly enough that people talk in satoshi terms, it will no longer be arbitrary, because satoshis are actually the base currency. The Bitcoin protocol fundamentally only deals in satoshis, and the rest is for convenience. Is that arbitrary, sure, but it's to get the benefit of that convenience. Just like we typically talk about cms or inches for small lengths, or miles and kilometers for long lengths. Just because it's arbitrary doesn't mean it's a bad idea.
And once you do settle on your scale, in this case, bitcoins, or milibits or whatever, of course you will then keep track of the exchange rate, using that unit, vs the dollar. 
I really don't see why this concept seems to bother you so much.

An easy way to tell if someone doesn't know what they're talking about, and is just looking to stir up market activity to get rich - is that they'll be making big predictions about the price being X in year 20XX, but they won't actually say why, it's all just "will revolutionise the industry", "has huge potential" etc. No reason not to be positive about bitcoin and its actual benefits, but these people are just greedy luddites who see some new magical internet money as some sort of analog for stocks and securities, and they just want to buy and sell like they do with everything else.

But what they're essentially saying is "buy the *real* dip, the *biggest* dip".
It's nonsense, the network 'eroding' is no great indicator to buy. If people stop mining or running nodes, that's the time to get out completely, not buy in. The mining reward should only reach equilibrium with electricity prices.

No disrespect, but it doesn't seem that you're qualified to make such a judgment, or that you're able to make it accurately.


You think I can load the front page of reddit by sending a connection through a computer that isn't connected to the internet?


Sorry to keep doing this, but again, you show you don't understand how this works. Payments don't have to only go via one channel, or one route at a time. If I need to send you 10BTC, I can send 6 BTC down one path through the network, and 4BTC down a completely different path. If the average channel cap on the network is very small, I can send you 10BTC split across very many routes. 


A computer which is offline is not using the internet. A computer which is offline is not using the lightning network. Let's give you the benefit of the doubt and assume you are getting at the question "what happens if a node becomes unavailable after a transaction has been routed to it, but before the transaction is transmitted onward?" - the answer is the transaction will fail, and immediately be re-sent via a different route, just like with normal internet traffic.


If the network is sufficiently large, fees will be the same on average regardless of the path that transactions take through the network. Some nodes on the network will be able to handle more transactions that others, but that will be transparent to users in the ideal scenario, there's no reason to care. There's no reason for a rational participant in the network to really care much at all about "who" their channels are with, in the beginning maybe, but again, once the network is sufficiently large, it won't matter. It will probably be optimal for your client to just choose 2+ nodes which have the best uptime and latency to you, much like how when you connect to the internet, you don't care that your http browsing gets routed through cloudflare, or akamai, or level 3, that's of no practical consequence to you as an end user.
Also, to begin with, there will be a limit to how much BTC can be held in a single channel. So a 'hub' would need to have many channels open to support being an above average volume participant in the network, and this is self-limiting, as opening channels has a cost, the btc on-chain fees to create the channels. Fees via all routes will converge to the market price, so opening more channels to be able to relay more transactions is unlikely to be profitable, but that remains to be seen, in the extreme case the rate of return will be very low, even if it is technically profitable.

Wouldn't nodes reject the second transaction, because they've seen the earlier one that already spent the utxo? So long as the seller checks to make sure your payment to them is in the mempool, I don't see how this would work. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 08:15:39
I don't know why they didn't just rebrand. The new interface is basically the same, but because they felt like they needed to change something, they used a different font which is harder to read and looks pixelated, and did something to the charts that makes them look blurry. I don't get it. The fonts and charts on gdax looked fine.
@_date: 2018-06-18 16:25:03
You can verify that a transaction has been added to the mempool. If you rely on another node or person to confirm that for you, they can just say "yep, I just sent you all these bitcoins, looks, here's the transaction in the mempool", but actually maybe they didn't. 
It also means that if there's a contentious fork, you a say in which fork you support. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:58:03
Actually it's quite hard to do, and to succeed it'd be more about tricking the vendor with social engineering or sleight of hand, than beating bitcoin's actual infrastructure. 
As a vendor, so long as you confirm, from an independant blockchain browser (or ideally your own node), that a transaction has been broadcast and is in the mempool, then at that point it'll be very hard for the customer to do anything about it. The only real option would be if it had a low fee, the network was congested, and after a couple of weeks it got dropped from the mempool, then the customer re-spent the same utxo(s). As a vendor, this is easily addressed with child-pays-for-parent, but also just by verifying thet the customer used a sensible fee before you hand over the goods. You could just have a process by which, whenever a tx gets to 7-days old, you use child-pays-for-parent to accelerate it, and write off the cost as a business expense, it may well be effective to incorporate this into a weekly dust-gathering tx, but I haven't sat down and worked out any real numbers on that.

Those people need to learn their lesson the hard way. How often do you buy euros, or yen, in a huge lump sum, hoping it will go up in value in the space of a couple of months? Have you ever done that once?
If you were moving to another country permanently, and had to transition all your money from USD to EUR, you'd do it bit by bit, averaging the cost. Bitcoin is no different. If you want to acquire bitcoin, slowly convert a little each month, and don't expect it to shoot up in value so you can become a millionaire. That's greedy and stupid. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:45:47
It's not a fork, all the other miners and nodes would be adding to the same chain, everyone would have to collectively agree to abandon everything from a particular block, and that would include any legit transactions.

But that's not really a benefit of bitcoin or decentralized crypto. There's no particular reason why crypto would increase the velocity of money any more than paypal, or venmo, or improvements in how fast bank transfers occur (they're very fast now in my country). 
The actual benefits that come from what is technologically unique and innovative about bitcoin, are never mentioned, and those benefits come with drawbacks which in some cases are at odds with increasing the velocity of money (this is even more so true for privacy focused coins).
The rest of the paragraph is pure speculation. X number will become Y, where Y is &gt;&gt;&gt; X. OK, so why doesn't he shut his mouth, buy all the crypto, and if what he says is even slightly accurate, he'll be the richest person in the world? No? So perhaps he's not so certain?

There are a few options, with different risk profiles. In order of most risky to least risky:
- Don't wait for confirmation
- Don't wait for confirmation, and use a wallet that supports child-pays-for-parent
- Use lightning - get near instant conf
- (This one isn't really a vendor centric thing) - but actual physical cash is still good. That's what Satoshi was hoping to emulate features of. So, you can just have bitcoin and make bitcoin transactions for digital exchanges, and in real life, use ATMs that will sell you physical fiat for bitcoin. There was a time when keeping physical cash in your wallet was the only way to pay for things in person, this solution already exists.

People buying lump sums expecting to get rich need to get burned by exchange rate drops to learn their lesson. Bitcoin is not magic, and it isn't here to make anyone rich. It's here to be money, and money fluctuates in value. Look at fiat, gold, everything that's ever been used to exchange value. The price changes often, sometimes by a lot. Most regular people don't shove their life savings into yen in a single transaction, but with bitcoin, that's what people think you can do. Or rather *thought*. They need to lose money doing that to realise that's a bad idea, and to make them stop doing it. In time, as all the people inclined to do this get burned, it will smooth out the exchange rate, making the extreme peaks and troughs less anomalous. That's good for bitcoin.

They all need your private keys to function. If they don't store your keys in some form server side, then that means they have to be on your machine, or you have to load them in every time, like with mymonero wallet. Either way, this is all unavoidable, and it's self-evident that giving your private keys to an application of any kind, allows it to steal your money. 
You shouldn't be using these types of wallets at all, but if you do, there's no functional difference between any of them, and them having your private keys isn't some bombshell revelation.

Buying an actual asset is not pure gambling, it's risky in the financial sense, sure, but not as risky as a futures contract. You do actually get the thing you've invested in. If you buy shares in a company, you can actually turn up to shareholder meetings and vote, and you will get paid if a dividend is declared, you actually own a chunk of the company. futures, cfs, bets, swaps etc are different. They are agreements between two parties to exchange money according to some point of reference or calculation, based on a completely unrelated asset which at no point does either party need to own. Some market makers do actually buy assets to hedge the contracts their clients take out, because they make their money via fees, but that's not a feature of the contract. 
If I buy a kilo of gold, whether I take receipt of it in my home, or pay a service provider to hold it for me, I do actually own that gold. Maybe I'm 'gambling' on its value changing, but that's not the same as just placing a bet that the price of gold will increase in the next 7 days by X amount, without ever purchasing any gold. If I'm wrong, I just lose money. If I actually bought gold, and it's value didn't rise by as much as I expected, or drops, I still have it. I can keep it for a long time to see if the price ever gets back to where it was, I can use it, to make jewellery or whatever else.

Once adoption slows down, and eventually when the block reward goes away, it will become more stable. Adoption has to happen first though, and this is just the very beginning. You still can't hardly use BTC for anything, so it'll keep increasing in price unpredictably for now.

I have a degree in computer science, and spent a decent chunk of my degree learning about encryption and cryptography, and the mathematics that underpins it, and at times I struggle to understand the concepts at play in various aspects of cryptocurrency. Also note that I do try. I try to understand how it all works.
Most people do not have that required base level of expertise for it to even be possible for them to understand without going back to school for 6+ months. Also note that most are not trying to understand. 
The vast majority of people 'on all sides' are just going by what they are told. It's just a race. Whoever tells them something first, wins. It goes in. You say to someone "doubling the block size will make fees lower", and if they don't know anything about it, and that's the first thing they've heard, that's it, game over, that idea is in their head and the damage is done.

Actually the kinds of things you do to secure cash can be equally applied to bitcoin. Get your seed or key onto some physical media (paper, usb stick, hardware wallet device etc) and put it in a safe, or safety-deposit box, in a lockbox with an attorney etc.

Because the heat is carried away by the boiling fluid. The liquid in the case wouldn't be particularly warm, and you want the boiled fluid to condense so it drips back down and tops up the liquid, otherwise the level might drop too much and you'd reach an equilibrium state with a bunch of the gas in the top of the tank with nowhere to dump its heat.

This will get downvoted to hell for being judgemental and preachy, but OP I think you need to hear this: A healthy marriage doesn't involve spouses hiding money from each other.
Those bitcoins are hers. You're married. She owns those coins, no less than you do. If you can't talk about this stuff, you have other issues that money won't solve. 
I don't have millions in BTC, but I talk to my wife about everything I'm doing, especially if it relates to money. She'll never understand cryptocurrency to the same level I do, I have a degree in computer science, she doesn't, and she also doesn't have any interest in it... but we're married, and every penny I put into bitcoin is one of her pennies.

Ah, ok, makes sense. So the advantage of an ASIC is actually that it can hash faster than other devices 'competing' the mine the same blocks. And the issue here is that the time it takes for the difficulty to adjust is long if there's a sudden, big dip in hashing power?

I don't necessarily agree with this, if it's someone completely uninformed and uninterested, only shoving some money in to gamble on making a profit and then turning it back into FIAT in a year or two. All that does is artificially pump the price of BTC, and introduces guaranteed instability in its value. People should buy bitcoin if they actually want bitcoin. If they want dollars, I don't think it's helpful for them to piggyback on BTC's growth, it could backfire on them, and it's bad for those of us who actually want to use BTC because it adds unnecessary volatility.
@_date: 2017-11-05 18:48:09
Capital gains is all about the growth, which will be interesting once it starts actually getting tested in court. 
If countries start to recognise Bitcoin as a legit currency/investment product, then the growth in Bitcoin's value will end up being sort of a negative for those who got in early, as they'd be taxed all to hell, and there's no way for them to obfuscate where the money came from or how much it was worth when they first got it.

I think part of the problem is we need to do a better job explaining why doing transactions with fiat is often presented to the purchaser of goods as being 'free'. It's not actually. Banks, payment processors, and vendors all have lots of costs associated with making transactions.

Part of fractional reserve banking is lending money such that the bank does not hold funds equivalent to their customers deposits. So... With bitcoin, depositors would just see that money gone from their accounts, and would be unable to spend their full balance. I'm not just talking about bank runs, you'd have the same effect if just a single person wanted to move all their money.
The only way to do fractional reserve banking with bitcoin would be to not actually use bitcoin, and instead operate on a system identical to the one we have now... Which defeats the whole point. If that's the desired use case, fiat is actually a better option.

The currency isn't the problem in the games industry,  it's the prices. Part of that is random loot boxes, where on average you pay more for what you want because you have to waste money on random stuff until you get the item you wanted, the other issue is just that on a per game basis, things that you can buy just tend to be extremely expensive in terms of marginal cost when compared with the base games. You pay 10-20% of the purchase price of a game for one cosmetic item, and that's ignoring markets like with dota or csgo, where item price is essentially unlimited.

Bitcoin being used as the currency wouldn't change any of that, but it also wouldn't give any benefit. And if you allow trading between players, they could sell in game items for bitcoin, and take that bitcoin out of the system, which is something most devs don't want. They want the money locked in the system, so that the only way for people to get new items is to give more money to them

There is no difference between the "HUB" or "P2P" models you refer to. A hub is just a node with a large number of open channels.
Anyone can open as many channels as they like. The ultimate effect is that the distribution of fees favours those who route more payments, and thus, potentially, nodes with more channels, and so in a round-about way, it's a proof of stake system, as routing payments essentially means having your funds loaded onto the LN, but unspent. This is not a bad thing. And fees will tend to the marginal cost of having open channels anyway. Factoring in the opportunity cost, and likely high costs to operate a node with many channels, it may well not be a logical choice to run such a node. Lightning is much more beneficial, economically, if you actually use it to spend. The more transactions you use the LN for, the more money you save vs theoretical on-chain fees. These savings will dwarf any profit that might be made from routing fees. It's not like mining.

I suppose it could go like this. But you really ought to open more channels, and this isn't really something for a user to fret over. So long as you open channels to other nodes which are well-connected, there's no issue.
The network wouldn't work very well if people just open a single channel per node, so that's not what people will do.

Bitcoin’s security and operation relies on financial incentives for the people secure it, a blockchain of this form without a financial incentive just won’t work, that would require a fundemental change in architecture.

It will help non-lightning users indirectly, because it will reduce the number of on-chain transactions, thus making fees less expensive. However the real benefits come from using it, where once you make more than a handful of transactions, you've saved money in transactions costs vs what it would have costed to make all those transactions on the base blockchain.

Highly unlikely unless your internet is cheap/free. You also have to make back what you pay in in-chain fees to open and close channels.
LN is not a moneymaker, the only way you're incentivised to use it is to actually make transactions of your own, saving yourself money vs on-chain fees. Opening channels and never using them is likely a break-even proposition in the best case scenario. Then there's the opportunity cost.

Hu is irrelevant, you just open up channels to whoever. As long as you have a few, you should be able to receive. 
There is no concept of an 'incoming' channel. Channels are bidirectional, and yes, there have to be funds on the sending end of one channel, but also realise that for a node to route a payment to you, they receive funds via one channel, and send via another. So they haven't lost their ability to send, even if that tx used all of their balance, they just have to next route a tx in the other direction, then they can do it in the original direction again.

The minimum fee is 1 satoshi. Your fee can be any number of satoshis. Bitcoin actually only deals in satoshis, everything is satoshis as far as the code is concerned. The whole sats/Byte payment logic is something that has been adopted by wallet applications, but it's not in any way a mandatory way of setting fees. You can technically create a transaction with 0 fee. Not sure if anyone would mine it though.

That's about $1k. If you are spending more than a few hundred in a single transaction, it's probably a better idea to use a regular bitcoin transaction anyway. LN is meant for more frequent, common transactions.

Be patient. 


There's no reason you can't withdraw from an exchange directly to a lightning wallet, or send payment to the lightning wallet of an exchange. Lightning is for whatever you want to use it for, you can pay or receive payment from anyone else also using it. 


No, that is a non-sequitur. Lightning reduces the number of on-chain transactions a user would do by a huge amount, and that effect will only increase over time. The only way lightning would add to the on-chain load vs now, would be for there to be a massive increase in adoption of bitcoin and specifically use of lightning. You're pretty down on LN, but you're implying it's going to get massive uptake and use. Sort of contradictory. 


Well that's just plainly false. Segwit does represent a significant increase in the number of transactions that can fit in a block. To dismiss this increase is extremely disingenuous. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 07:08:56

It seems unlikely you will make more than the bandwidth costs you.

Your transactions are routed through multiple channels, sure, but a user must have their own node to participate in the network, and to have a good chance of being able to route, they need 3+ channels. You can't use the fact that the network is routed to say that one channel signifies hundreds or thousands of users, it doesn't. It can only support as many transactions as can be made using the funds in the channel, or the bandwidth of the nodes. And no of transactions also is not something which is a direct indicator of number of users. One user could made thousands of transactions per second.

So true. And it's not just banks. Any successful company, once they become successful - none of their systems dealing with money will ever change. Sure they might tweak things or fix things if something is really broken, but whatever and however their code was built once they got big, that's it, forever, because everyone is too scared to break the big magic machine with all the money in it.

Well, if you're doing crime, a currency that's more traceable and less private than cash is never going to be your first choice if you can help it.

Sure. we agree on this.


Not sure what you mean. There were no futures when 2X was pending. 


I don't care. I deal in reality. Truth is truth. 


No, in the nomenclature of forks, user activated forks, and miner activated forks, are distinguished.
This is not a semantic game. You didn't define those terms and you don't get to change them. 


To summarize: UASF forced protocol change because bitcoin is only valuable if users use it. UASF can't force adoption because bitcoin is valuable whether its in a segwit wallet or a legacy wallet.
none of this is relevant to this discussion. User adoption of segwit is not relevant to how it was activated: by miners. Miners signalled segwit support, and activated segwit, because they were in favour of segwit2X. It was fortuitous for us all that things turned out the way they did, and we got segwit without the 2 hard fork, but that doesn't change how it happened.

But if a channel is unbalanced in one direction, it is therefore likely to be able to route many payments in the other direction. Yes this makes single channels not universally perfect, but that's why you don't just have one channel. If one channel to the recipient is unbalanced towards them, you just pay them via a different route. 
I suppose the case this doesn't work for would be a lightning hodler, who sits on the edge with few channels and only ever receives. But that then incentives such a node to route payments, no? To rebalance their channels for their own benefit.

Some algorithms are demonstrably harder to create asics for. By making an algorithm that uses lots of cache, you make it hard to produce an asic for it, because it would need lots of fast memory, while cpus and gpus handle it just fine.

The crux is the attacker has to fill the blockchain by paying the highest market fee, for however long it takes the punishment transactions locktimes to expire. This would be monumentally expensive, and ignores the possibility of a miner/pool who also runs watchtowers mining the punishment transactions, so they get their punishment reward. Or even just a miner/pool who mine lightning punishment transactions on principle.

Bitcoin has a much longer and more intensive historical proof of work. The only thing that could attack the bitcoin chain, is 51+% of all bitcoin miners, no other pow-based blockchains have that. 




Being first isn't why it's valuable, its characteristics and continued development are.




Obviously this is a point of comparison with fiat.




Maybe so, but until then, bitcoin is still adding new useful improvements, there are excellent developments on the way to address, scaling and privacy, in ways that no other cryptocurrency has done, and that they won't beat bitcoin to implementing.

What you like isn't important. LN transactions are transactions on the lightning network. There is no concept of finalization, you can close channels, and whatever funds are yours from those channels will be transferred to a non-LN address on the blockchain.

I guess it depends what you favour, redundancy, or the absolute certainty the seed won't be stolen. 
With strong encryption, there's really nothing to worry about, especially if you do the encrypting on an air-gapped computer. But given time, quantum computing may reach a point where it's feasible to crack what we consider strong encryption now. You'd have plenty of warning of this though, time enough to generate a new seed, and store it some other way, or using quantum resistant encryption. Indeed many encryption schemes in use right now are quantum resistant.

From the perspective of a  non-techie, almost nothing has happened to Bitcoin in the past year. The fork came and went with little meaningful impact to a normal person, the drama was entirely contained to the techie enthusiast crowd, and things like lightning are just too complicated for a normal person to care about until it's done, live, and decently road-tested. Heck, even most vanilla bitcoin wallet software and apps are really shit in terms of usability from the perspective of a non-techie.

When those companies inevitably fail in their efforts, or are exposed for their lies, that will be the bursting of the bubble.

All you're doing it creating a lot of time-wasting for yourself. 
Put the seed in a text file and encrypt it properly. Job done. Now store copies in secure places. Give your parents an encrypted paper wallet, don't tell them the passphrase. Put a copy of the encrypted container in your cloud storage. That's probably enough, you now have 3 secure copies, in different locations. 
If you want more redundancy, add another location, another friend or backup service. 
Multi-sig provides no protection here. Using a password a few characters longer provides more security than your complicated 6-word-doc scheme.

What lessons have you learned?
I'm sorry to hear about this. I can only hope this kind of money isn't backbreaking for you. I know if I lost that much it would be a huge hit.
The important thing now is to do it right next time. 
Get yourself a hardware wallet for a start. A trezor or a ledger. Never use anything else. Next is to get your password security right. 
Get yourself a password manager, like keepass, create a database, come up with a long-as-fuck password for it, something you'll remember, a long book or movie name of something that's important to you. special characters, uppercase etc, isn't that important, but it needs to be long, I'm talking 25-30 characters minimum. Now, your first, and most annoying job, is to go through everything, and I mean everything you have accounts for online. Don't ignore shit that doesn't seem important, because if you've ever used the same password in more than one place, that's all it takes. You're going to **change your passwords for everything**. I'm serious. Every single online account you can think of, go through your email, anywhere you've ever created an account, log in, change the password for one created by the password generator in your password manager. The length should be the longest the site supports, and if the site supports special characters, spaces etc, your password should include those. Don't be put off by having all these crazy long passwords, you don't need to remember any of them, that's a plus, you can't lose a password you don't know, you can't re-use a password you don't know. While you're doing this, turn on 2-factor authentication for everything that supports it. Paypal, gmail, cryptocurrency exchanges, all your bank accounts, turn it on for everything. 
This will be a huge pain in the ass. For months you'll be remembering or stumbling across accounts you forgot about, and having to change the passwords. It's worth it. Once you do get through the pain of switching to this approach, it becomes a lot easier. Whenever you make a new account, you just use your password manager to generate the password.
And I'll say this again just to reinforce the point: get a hardware wallet if you want to use bitcoin. Whenever you deal in bitcoin, remember that it's not yours if you hand it over to someone else, you don't have control of it while it's handed over to someone else. A website is someone else. Let go of the notion that there are options for different types of bitcoin wallet, there aren't: you only use hardware wallets or cold wallets (cold storage is a subject for you to read up on once you've deal with everything else). 
edit: spelling, grammar, fleshed out some points.

Quite the opposite, hence my consternation. 


That's not just a lightning network issue, that's just not how pki works at all. A key can be used to sign or encrypt whatever the holder wants at all, anything else must be enforced separately in software, which it cannot if you give the key to someone else, because they could just take the key and not use the software which enforces such rules. 


The is no 'You' in cryptography. If someone else has your keys, they can perfectly impersonate you. That is a bad thing, not something you should be seeking to achieve.


We're not talking about traffic, we're talking about money. If your node is unavailable, lightning transactions will not be routed through it, you will not be involved. If you wish to collect fees, you must have your node online. This financial self-interest is the incentive for people to run nodes. You can't have someone else run a node, taking on the costs, but you yourself receive a fee. That's money for nothing, why would someone do that for you?

Right, and that fee pays for the transaction. With traditional banking, they don't charge you a fee to send because they already have all your money. You hand it over, they invest it to make profit for themselves, pay you very low or zero interest, and allow you to spend some of your money that you handed over to them. With bitcoin, you have your money. You can invest it, nobody else controls it.

Miners supported segwit because they were in favour of doing segwit+doubling of the block limit (or weight limit after segwit). The doubling of the block size was abandoned because of a large amount of backlash in the community who only wanted segwit.
But if those miners didn't initially think 2x was happening, there's no guarantee they would have supported segwit as fast, as widely, or at all

It's always been like this except for times when people are deliberately spamming the network to fill up blocks. The idea was always for bitcoin to scale capacity in line with growth. But basing the decision to do so on artificial growth is a mistake. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:07:20
When did I say the problem was solved? Just being able to find out about the state of the network doesn't mean you have an efficient way to use that to figure out routes. You still need a good algorithm for how to decide what set of channels and nodes to even consider. 
But the issue is not that that data is not available, as was suggested in part the comment I originally replied to, which was:

You already created the newest state transaction. I suppose though there's a risk if you receive a payment after you go offline. ~~I'm not sure how that's handled.~~ Actually, no it shouldn't work if you're offline I think, so that's ok.
As to the case with a watchtower, the watchtower also has a pre-signed transaction with a shorter time-lock than the transaction for the state of the channel, which gives all the funds to you and the watchtower, so they can broadcast that if the other channel party tries to cheat you. Your channel partner can't use a tx you haven't signed, so their only option for shenanigans to use a transaction you signed which is out of date, and if they do, you can then publish your punishment transaction that gives you all the funds in the channel.

It's due to a lot of people rushing in to buy it and sell it just to make a profit. You can't help it, but it will take time for the system to be able to support that without large fluctuations. Right now, the only meaningful basis for the value of 1 BTC is how much investors will buy/sell it for. Once BTC is used to pay for goods and services, that will be a much stronger basis on which to determine its value, since nobody will trade it at a price that's massively out of whack with the value of items or services you can buy with it. Right now it's like one of those inflatable tube guys you see outside car dealerships, only anchored at one end, and flailing all over the place as a result.

But two players can just set up a trade, where one gives something to the other, or maybe trades something the other person wants, in exchange for a low/negligible value item, and then the other person pays the sender of the meaningful item.
This is avoided in games where you are either a) forced to buy and sell items on the market, in the way a dev wants, and locking the funds, of whatever type, into the system. Or b) you can't trade with other players at all, which is what most games do.

yes. The challenge I see with that is, operating a node, and being able to use it on the go. Hopefully you'll be able to run a node on a server or something, and have a client on your phone that has the keys to spend with the node, because the idea of running a node on my phone sounds like a nightmare, because the battery wouldn't last more than a couple of hours, and anyone without unlimited bandwidth would see it clogged and their bill would be astronomical.

It's an academic point more than anything. A lightning node has no use for information about transactions that don't involve the lightning network, so there's no functional need for it to have that info. It is presumably however much easier for a lightning wallet dev to simply assume a full node is readily available?

You can't get $10 from someone who only has $5, that's pretty obvious. 
However, you could get $3 via one route, and $7 via another. 
The other mitigating factor is that well-connected nodes will route payments in either direction, so once the network is large and utilized enough, channels will rebalance. Also, once a channel has low funds on one side, it will be far more likely that it will route transactions in the other direction, and not in the same direction as before (because there aren't enough funds to do them in that direction), and this will also serve to rebalance channels.
You can also rebalance your own channels if you really need to (send funds from a channel where the funds are mostly on your end, to another of your channels where the funds are skewed towards your channel partner)

The devs aren't stupid, schnorr sigs are something that helps scaling, and was considered irrespective of the level of use.

That's two keys then. For two different channels. That you're giving to someone else. I shouldn't have to explain why this is bad. 


That's not how lightning works. Your software would take a payment in via one of your channels, and send another out though another channel. If you give the keys to someone else, then you aren't involved anymore. And you've either given them access to your node, so they can take all your money, or you're basically asking someone else to host a node for you, and trusting that they don't run off with all your money. It just doesn't make sense.




So, first of all, what do you think 'Offline' means? Because it actually means not being connected to the internet, in which case your node isn't doing anything. If something gets 'redirected' (what does that mean here) to another node, you aren't involved.

This is a good point. Retail is one of the most time sensitive use cases, iirc bitpay will only wait for you to get into the next 2 blocks when you try to checkout. This drives the demand to get txs into the next block, whereas a lot of other use cases don't need 1 block confs.

It was an ineloquent answer you replied to. What he's referring to is that cryptographically, the bitcoin blockchain is hard to tamper with, and its distributed nature means no one person or group can exercise unilateral control of it, as with state-issued fiat. Now none of this is related to commodity backed currencies, which are quite rare these days.
I don't even think it's an important point. The only people who ask about this topic are people so uninformed, that they think their state's fiat is backed by something like gold, when it isn't.

If you use change addresses, it quickly become impossible to figure out which address belongs to who. 
Worst case scenario your employer would be able to see your first transaction after getting paid, they'd know when you made it, and have a 50/50 guess for how much you sent (lower odds if you could split up change payments into multiple addresses, with schnorr sigs this would become a pretty obvious wallet feature.), after that, they really couldn't know much more. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:16:43
The first transaction you use to open a handful of channels only needs to use one on chain transaction. But yes, closing and opening new ones after that will use a transaction each time. 
The idea is that being able to send transactions off-chain will lessen the load on the main chain, and mean on-chain fees are lowered. At any time though, there will always be some level of usage which is too high to be supported by the main chain, and we need solutions for that. After a month or so, the system self-corrects (some number of people dissatisfied at high transaction costs get fed up and stop using bitcoin), but ultimately the risk is still there.

The name isn't important, but nobody has yet invented a useful application of blockchain technology that doesn't involve a cryptocurrency. 
Thus far, projects advertising blockchain usage either don't really use a blockchain as it exists in crypto, or are using a blockchain for something which is more effectively implemented using traditional data models and database systems. Not everything in the world is best modeled as a transaction, and blockchains just don't work if you need to trust something other than the blockchain.

As long as you use the watchtower system, you'd be fine, your node would become uncooperative, and your channel partner would close the channel, and you'd either get the funds you own, or all of the channel funds minus the fee for the watchtower. 
If you don't use the watchtower system, then you would be at risk from your channel partner stealing from you. But you have quite a long time to deal with it (weeks I think by default), so as long as you back up your keys and get your node back up and running within 2 weeks, you'd be ok.

A lightning wallet doesn't *need* a full node, it just needs to see all commitment transactions on the blockchain. At the moment that's a tiny fraction, however over time, theoretically this would tend towards a lightning node essentially being a full node. Whether or not software implementations will currently only allow you to use the network by hooking it up to a full bitcoin node, is neither here nor there. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:22:36
but lightning channels are not permanent, you'd need some way to constantly bind your id to channels as you close and open them. 
also, where would the association between a channel and an id be stored?


because you have control of one of the keys for the multi-sig wallet which contains the channel funds. I don't see how that helps you secure something completely unrelated.

No, lightning channels are multi-sig wallets, when you receive bitcoin via lightning, it goes into one of those multi-sig wallets associated with one of your channels. You have cryptographic control over that wallet. The bitcoin is yours, there is no IOU. Think of it more like a joint bank account. Money goes in, and you and the other account holder (channel partner) need some way to decide how that money gets handled. In the case of lightning, it's the cryptographic protocols that control who owns what amount, and how to close the channel.

Both. Less space is taken up because transactions can be moved off-chain, but the benefits of ln long term will drive adoption and eventually we'll reach an equilibrium point where there are just enough on-chain transactions such that the fees are acceptable to most users, and whatever commensurate level of LN usage that means. 
Realistically, in the short term it will free up some space on the blockchain, but I wouldn't expect this effect to last long. Bitcoin is still in its infancy, both in terms of features and adoption.

Right, but unless we get triple the usage overnight, LN should be there to meet the demand of the growth we see for a good while. Once LN takes off, it will be really difficult to reach the saturation point where the on-chain transactions to support LN max out the current block size. Especially because they'll all be segwit transactions. We should also see schnorr sigs at least before that happens, and who knows what other on chain scaling improvements.

That's pretty fucking rich, all the times I've been the victim of financial fraud or theft, it's been due to a weakness in visa's systems. 
Like when a guy stole my debit card, and was able to spend a bunch of money by faking (very poorly) my signature, even though the card was a chip+pin card. What's the point of the fucking chip and pin if you let people spend money without providing them? 
That's like having online banking where the "forgot your password" function just gives you a button to press that says "I'm this guy" and then logs you in anyway. 
Then there was a time there were a bunch of charges on my card, so it was either cloned, or someone stole the card details. Either way, they were able to spend my money with nothing more than the details present on the card, which is printed and always visible, so... if I ever reveal my card on a security camera, or someone takes a photo of it from behind my in the queue, nothing visa can do? I don't even get the verified by visa prompt anymore when I spend online. And these jokers have the gall to advertise that they're safer than cash.

No, with RBF you can submit a second transaction that spends the same bitcoins, and it includes a number that says this transaction is more recent. The idea is it allows you to update the transaction if you sent it with too low a fee and it won't confirm. The downside is it means you can change the outputs too, so for merchants, it's best to insist that customers pay without using RBF (this can be checked by all parties, it's just a number in a field in the transaction that gets broadcast.)

Basically if you want an aggregate statistic, you need to know the average upload bandwidth available to each lightning node, and the average data load on the network per transaction, from there, you can make a pretty accurate average.
Upload bandwidth will be far and away the most limiting factor for nodes. Just like it is for pretty much all web based systems. Lightning is not processing intensive, there's very little number crunching, there's no proof of work, no mining etc. Once the network is large enough that there's enough BTC in the network to support most transactions, it will all come down to bandwidth.

There's no such thing as a 'hub' in the workings of LN, there are nodes, nodes can have as many channels as they like, with whatever balances in them. 
Yes you would need to be connected to a node capable of routing payments to you. But this isn't a problem, the network exists, you can open channels to nodes on the network. As the network grows, the number of nodes that can be reliably routed to will also grow, and the number of channels with sufficient funds to route will increase. Imbalanced channels on the part of routing nodes are not a concern because they can be easily rebalanced, if a node routes a tx in through one channel and out through another, in a way that means the latter now has low funds on their side, then the next time they are chosen to route a transaction it will be one that comes in on that latter channel. This can happen hundreds of times a minute. I calculated that with my home bandwidth I could comfortably route 65+ transactions per second.

Very simple, but also very simple for a wallet or payment processor to include the option for merchants to only accept 0-conf transactions where nsequence is gte 0xFFFFFFFE. This could be presented very simply to servers, with a big red UI element that says something to the effect of "Advise user not to use replace by fee options in their wallet". Then you get into less of a technical space, and more of a process/customer service space.

Well at some point you have to expect that if you never sell, you're going to do something else, like spend the bitcoin in exchange for goods and services, and if the fiat equivalent value of your bitcoin never exceeds what you paid for it, then you've de facto lost money because you will only get a particular amount of goods or services in relation to the value of bitcoin. 
I expect the exchange rate to trend upwards long term, sure. But that's not guaranteed, and it's also possible that intra-ath prices can be lower than what a person bought their btc for for an extended amount of time. There'll always be someone that buys the peaks. I've been travelling many times, where I've had to get local currency, and been stuck buying when the exchange rate is really shitty for me, but that's the time I need the currency, so I have no choice. Bitcoin will be no different.

There's no reason that wages can't go down if paid in bitcoin, because minimum wage is set in fiat and will be for a long time to come. Bitcoin isn't meant to solve the problem of low wages. That's a societal issue not a technical one.

The approaches aren't comparable. Card payments are built on extreme reliance on trust. Bitcoin is the opposite. With a traditional payment card, the payment doesn't actually have to get processed anywhere close to the point you make your transaction, and after that, the money can be pulled back again if the payment processor feels like it.

Lightning is still very early and also it's designed to be a solution that enables micro-payments. The chance of a routing failure increases as you try to send larger and larger amounts. This will improve as the network capacity grows, but lightning is best suited to payments ranging from high frequency payments on the order of satoshis, through to everyday spending, like the amounts you'd spend on a movie or buying groceries. These sorts of transactions will have a pretty low rate of routing failures.
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:15:22
I mean, my personal benchmark isn't a year, I'm just waiting for there to be lightning wallets that are feature-complete, and out of beta before I put any significant amount of money into them. Would you put your money into a bank account with a bank that sometimes fails to send wire transfers, and which sometimes you can't withdraw your money from for extended periods?
For some people perhaps a few hundred dollars in an unfinished lightning wallet represents a minimal risk profile. Maybe that's not much money for them. Maybe they personally derive value from gaining a hands-on understanding and feel that for them, they can only get that by putting real money on the line. That's not me. That's not what most people, who probably ought not to, and don't want to risk their money, should be doing. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 19:56:11
P2P lending works. People are doing it right now, with fiat admittedly, but as far as I understand, they can't loan out more than lenders have deposited, so you don't have the issue you have with big banks where they are allowed to lend (or do anything really) with money they don't necessarily have on deposit.
With smart contracts you could comfortably handle the payment side of things. Technology isn't really the challenge, it's the initial decision about whether or not to lend to a particular borrower. That is inherently a decision based on trust, and trust cannot be removed from the decision like with plain crypto transactions, because ultimately the transaction is in trust alone. The lenders are answering the question "do we think this person will pay this loan back?", and I don't see a way for tech to deal with that.

You could, but right now that's not part of the protocol or a standardised wallet feature. Remember, lightning isn't ready. I know everyone is pissing themselves with excitement because people are opening up channels on mainnet, but that's incredibly high risk, and even though the chance that people will lose money to software bugs is low, that doesn't change the fact that lightning is in its infancy, and most wallets are not even feature complete in terms of basic functionality that's part of the lightning network spec. You're talking about features that it is not reasonable to expect to see implemented until there are multiple, feature-complete, non-beta releases of lightning wallets, and even then, it's not going to be a priority, because as the network grows, the chance of routing failures will go down anyway.

I dunno man, I work for a major international company with a huge footprint in the US, I'm talking household name consumer electronics, and one of my British colleagues was denied entry to the US on a business trip. He's an IT guy, he was just going to one of our US offices to help them fix something that he was knowledgeable about. 
It was a short trip, he's a white british guy, and he was there for a business trip working for a big famous international company, visa was all arranged beforehand. They stopped him, questioned him, then sent him home. Wouldn't even let him in. 
The part about him being white isn't me saying that makes him better or anything, but I just mention it to show that they weren't even doing racial profiling, it's not like he was dark skinned with a big beard. There was no logical reason, bigoted or otherwise, to deny him entry.

I did lose money, for at least a day or two I had to go without it, and with no card. I was repaid later, and eventually got a new card. I lost out financially, and I lost out in terms of availability. That is not secure. And the insurance could have just as easily decided it was my fault my card or card details got stolen, they're pretty fickle with it, I know people who have had hundreds of pounds stolen from their bank accounts, and the bank's insurers decided it was somehow their fault, so they didn't get reimbursed.
If visa were just not idiots, and required that to spend with a chip+pin card, you had to enter the pin, or go through 2FA for cardholder not present transactions, I never would have lost any money and neither would they. Visa never will have got that money back, the insurance paid me, and visa pay for the insurance. 
I work in infosec and have worked for multiple large international financial services companies, don't tell me that this is what security means, it doesn't. Visa doesn't have strong security. It has a big ol' safety net with giant holes in it, because their customers get screwed so often.

right, but do they allow you to make transactions using the card without entering the pin?

Having a security feature that only applies to people who aren't breaking the rules, but can be disregarded by anyone who wishes to, isn't a security feature at all. It's security theatre.


No, bitcoin is modelled to be like cash. There's no way to make complaints or get refunds when you hand over physical cash. Bitcoin is like that, **by design**, and most certainly does not require something it was specifically intended not to be compatible with.

I.e. One party has fiat, one has BTC in the LN layer.
That would really be a separate discussion, but there are certainly possible approaches, though when fiat is involved you are essentially going to have to have some trust someone, somewhere. P2P exchanges that are trustless currently are usually just for exchanging one crypto for another. Without the features provided by a cryptocurrency, you need a way to control and confirm receipt of the fiat funds, which obviously isn't possible trustlessly. This is why localbitcoins and bittylicious and similar fiat p2p exchanges use an escrow system, so you're essentially trusting the platform. Bitcoin and Lightning can't fix the fundamental problems with fiat, that's why they exist.


To open a channel where only one party adds funds? I think eclair can do it on desktop, but right now I wouldn't recommend doing it except to maybe open some channels with yourself purely to test. All lightning implementations are very immature and that goes double for any features beyond opening a simple channel under normal circumstances. If you want to use beta software (that's what they call themselves but they're all alpha in truth), with real money, that's your choice, but I don't recommend it.

Nope, not correct, I think there's some linguistic gymnastics going on there. 
That's not 'possible' in the sense that lightning doesn't do anything to support or encourage people to use custodial wallets. Like asking if it's possible for someone else to let you store your water in their cup. The cup isn't really the important part of that arrangement.
Could you hand dollars over to someone and have them manage a lightning wallet on your behalf? Sure, but it would involve on-chain transactions at some point, because a lightning channel is created on-chain, so the custodial wallet provider would have to, at some point, in anticipation, or in response to your involvement, create channels, and that'd be on the blockchain.
In case my subtle sarcasm didn't make clear at the start though: DO NOT FUCKING EVER DO DO THIS DON'T DON'T DON'T. This is a terrible idea. 


There will be a point, some level of high adoption of lightning, that will entail a lot of on-chain activity, and that will cause on-chain fees to go up. Lightning doesn't make this challenge go away, it just vastly increases the amount of transacting that can be done without reaching this saturation point.

Decentralisation is not one thing, it is a metric to be considered of something else. Mining centralisation is not the same as node centralisation, is not the same as ceramic vase manufacturing centralisation, etc. 
With regards to bitcoin mining, the key factor that informs an evaluation of centralisation is whether or not there is a party that can perform a 51% attack. Right now, there's little chance of that.

I think you've internalised a lot of assumptions and prejudices about why people are interested in crypto, and are projecting them. 
You're also bringing up irrelevant topics to the current topic of conversation. 
I never said anything about liking blackrock, or disliking them. I never said anything about whether blackrock offering crypto investment services to their customers would be a good or bad thing. And if you think a FS provider offering crypto investments to their clients is "taking over your space", then you've no idea what you're talking about. If Jeff Bezos sells a load of stock and gets billions of dollars, is he taking over the dollar? No, he's not, that's a retarded thing to think.

I don't think anyone has trademarked "cod", but if I sell you a tin of sardines, labelled "cod", along with a little pamphlet explaining that, despite not immediately appearing to be cod, the contents of the tin are cod, and that they're *real* cod, much better than the fish that other fish sellers will give you if you ask for Cod. Well that's fraud. Even though there's nothing inherently wrong or bad about sardines, it's not legal to go about selling them while claiming that they are anything other than sardines.
Edit: lol cod, not coc

Your underlying problem in using this approach is the arrows have different meanings, making the whole thing inconsistent, sometimes the arrow represents process/time flow, sometimes the arrow represents additional information about another part of the diagram. 
Honestly I don't think bitcoin lends itself to this visual approach. I think you're better off separating out use cases, and referencing them where appropriate. For example, mining is one use case, which, when considering transactions within a block, can make mention of the fact that those transactions were validated and broadcast by nodes. Trying to come up with a single flow-style diagram misrepresents the temporally decoupled nature of the various use cases involved. Consider just a few months ago, a node might verify and publish a transaction that sits in the mempool for days/weeks before a miner pays attention to it. That decoupling is important to capture. The mempool is not a strict queue/stack. 
This is just one example of why I think it's best to seperate the use cases out.
edit: spelling.

Because in mining it can cause catastrophic problems for the entire network.
With lightning centralisation allows a party to be a minor nuisance only to those who open channels with them, which you don't have to do. You can't choose who mines your bitcoin transactions and you can't stop someone with &gt;50% of the hashrate attacking the blockchain and wreaking havoc. In lightning you can just choose not to open channels to nodes that misbehave. And those misbehaving nodes can't do anything like as bad. Worst case scenario a channel partner goes dark, but has a watchtower, so you have to wait for the locktime of the channel to end. That's a minor inconvenience, (and as the network matures I fully expect we'll see a range of channel locktimes, for different use cases, e.g. shorter for those wishing to make frequent payments with a low risk of funds being tied up, you can also open many channels and spread your bitcoin evenly amongst them, so if one channel partner goes dark you can pay via another channel) but individual channels are limited in how much bitcoin they can contain, and that affects only a handful of  parties at a time. You could always implement a limit that says a node can only have 10 channels max. Or just choose to never open a channel of your own with a partner that has more channels than you deem to be acceptable, if you have a very strong and conservative opinion on the matter, you could just set your personal limit at 3 or 4.

Being frugal and risk-averse obviously means you're less likely to want to invest money in Bitcoin.
That sub is generally run in service of providing advice to (real talk) either poor people, or people who know nothing about finance and need to be instilled with basic knowledge to be able to stop themselves going bankrupt. Bitcoin is not for people like this, not until they can pay rent and buy groceries with it. Bitcoin requires research, understanding, and is volatile to the extent that it's still not prudent to invest anything other than completely disposable income in it (in my opinion).
It should be obvious that most people in the audience of that sub definitely should not be messing with bitcoin just yet.

This seems like you're massaging the definition of centralisation as most involved with crypto understand it. Typically the issue is around participation, i.e. can more and varied individuals participate in the operation of the network, if so, that's more decentralised. This means hardware requirements being lower enables more decentralisation. Completely hiding the identity of transacting parties would require a lot of more data, if you thought the 2X debate was fierce, imagine how the arguments over increasing the size of the blockchain to allow for ring signatures would be. To keep using Monero as the example, even with pruning, for the same volume of transactions, the size of blocks would be much larger than Bitcoin. 
I'm all for privacy, but I think we have to be cognizant of the trade-offs that it requires.

Implicitly they'd be giving the impression to paying customers that this was a suitable avenue for payment.

The groundwork has been lying about for decades, digital money, proof of work, elliptical curve crypto, merkle trees, the technology could have supported it even sooner, but it always takes some time for one person to have that 'eureka' moment and combine disparate works into one thing to provide something new, different, and more than the sum of its parts. It doesn't seem likely that Satoshi was sitting on the idea for years, waiting for hard drive prices and bandwidth availability to grow, though he came out with the idea at an opportune time, and the network would have struggled with those issues sooner had it started a few years earlier.

Sure, but the benefit reduces per node as the node count grows. That point is not in dispute. I'm merely pointing out that running a node is justified by the different metric, of personal trust, of the person running it, in themselves, vs doing so because they think they're helping out the network.
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:51:49


If someone buys cryptocurrency there's no fraud. 
If it turns out the place they transferred money to takes their money and doesn't give them crypto in return, sure, that's fraud, but blocking people from buying X just in case the seller of X is a scammer makes no sense. It's not the bank's responsibility or right to decide which retailers are and aren't scammers without any evidence that they might be.

I'm about as big a champion of lightning as you'll find, but this is incorrect and you do the community a disservice by lying about it. How to efficiently create end to end routes is a challenge. As the node count grows, you have to acess all that information to decide what route through the network to take. Onion routing refers to the encryption approach used, it has nothing to do with how routes are chosen. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:39:07
Most altcoins are functionally the same as bitcoin, so straight away, unless something changes, those will die in the long term.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:05:49
Onion-routing is a well understood feature of tor, and I don't think it's appropriate to try and repurpose that name here. It's not the same thing. Whoever wrote the documentation where they stole that name, was irresponsible imo. The encryption approach is logically similar. That's all. The routing is entirely unrelated.
Whatever you wish to call it, the way routes are prepared by the lightning network is inefficient and once the network gets large enough, people will be constrained by the memory requirements of dealing with it unless we come up with a better way to calculate routes that doesn't need the whole network in memory at once. 


That argument is irrelevant, because it's nonsense. The issue isn't working vs not working, it's a question of **WHAT IS REQUIRED** for it to work **WELL**.

Indirectly in many cases there is a record. Mainly security camera footage in retail stores. If the man wants to find you, he can get the footage from when you made your cash transaction, and go from there.

Yeah, the issue with schnorr is that even though the idea was known/understood, it was only implemented under a patent, and so there's no open source reference code. That means to implement it in bitcoin you're literally starting from scratch, which makes it take that much longer.

Lightning also offers significantly better privacy than the base bitcoin blockchain. It's not as good as monero in privacy terms, but it's a nice bonus, that using lightning hides more about your transacting than plain bitcoin transactions. It may even be possible to foil analysis of your transactions by creating two nodes, funding one, and sending the btc to the other. At that point, it's extremely difficult to link the two nodes together, and will only really be possible if the attacker is able to surveil you in other ways, such as having spyware on your computer or some kind of visibility of accounts used to spin up servers or something. 
If you're super paranoid, you could open and fund one node using tor, and only access and close the second, receiving node on a fresh tor connection. Timing attacks then become your only real online attack vector, which is already true of tor anyway. For better or worse, lightning might make this one-man money washing sort of activity a lot easier.

I don't worry about this argument much, any pow-based cryptocurrency in the long term will reach a point of equilibrium where the reward for mining is only slightly higher than the cost to mine.

It's not a question of accuracy, it just doesn't matter. You can have subdivisions, or not, and the end result is the same, the currency settles at some level of exchange vs other nation's currencies, and the value ends up where it should vs goods and services, and whether the value of a banana is 1 unit, or 50 sub-units, doesn't matter. You don't change anything, and people are just as comfortable dealing with thousands of won as they are dealing with tens of dollars. This is reality and cannot be denied.

By that same tack, we might not have had those things anywhere near as soon, had nobody invested in them. Even if bitcoin's price tanks, but bitcoin is still around and becomes widely used, I see that as a win, because I'm not involved with bitcoin just to get rich quick.
Buffet can't understand crypto because he only care about money, so that's all he can see. But crypto isn't just another stock to buy low and sell high. Crypto is a change in how trust is managed, and what trust is required, and in whom.

It's my opinion based on many years professional experience in the security industry, manipulated by nothing but what I've seen working for various companies/clients who either have a product with a vuln disclosed, or use something that gets a vuln disclosed.
Knowing what's going on is useless to average users who have no ability to do anything about the vulnerability. Telling the vendor first means they have the chance to ready a patch before the vulnerability is widely exploited. This is doubly true for vulnerabilities discovered through security research, where there's no indication of exploit code or knowledge of the vuln in the wild.
