If your are from the bcash community and are reading this, let that sink in for a minute.
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:25:27
If we could bet on "blockchain" it wouldn't be gambling. But we're effectively "betting" on Bitcoin becoming the best proven protocol of blockchain technology.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:29:55
First Layer has ultimate authority over Second Layer. If the fundamental first layer stays decentralized, it still enables anyone in the world to send transactions without being blocked by a centralized hub.
I will add that bcash is playing a dangerous game that could lead to centralization of the first layer. I think LN is waay less risky of a bet for scaling solutions.

Hi bcash paidshill1968! In case, you haven't noticed.. the market has already chosen Bitcoin over Bitcoin Cash. Move on.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:07:45
I did find the old news post from back in August! 
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:00:20
I checked the news this morning about bitcoin, all FUD articles everywhere. I always buy BTC in proportion of how much FUD is broadcast online.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:30:29
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:38:20
Did anyone ever consider to increase it overtime at a predictable pace? Like 0.1 mb every x number of blocks. Could be any numbers and should be based on how bandwith and storage space evolves historically.
@_date: 2018-01-21 17:19:33
Ugandan Knuckles have something to do with this.
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:59:20
Well.. if that happens I will be forced to buy more..
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:39:50
Again, I am not against bigger block at all. I just admit that the optimization of block space is more important for long term sustainability.
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:30:12
You can just google it to find tons of articles explaining why. I personnally see it as a big issue for me if the blockchain grows 8x faster than current pace. The 1.6TB blockchain increase per year that bcash is proposing will not be sustainable, especially for me if I want to run a full node. And yes, that is only if bcash implements their 32mb blocks solution with full blocks every 10 mins. I wouldn't mind the 32mb blocks in 5-10 years if price and basic storage followed. I am mostly concerned about bandwith usage. We do not all have unlimited internet. Downloading over 1.6TB blockchain will take some people months to set up a full node. 
But yeah, we can decide to ignore all this and let the big boys with lots of money run their mining rigs and nodes but am afraid this will create a center point of attack that could be made. Don't get me wrong, I don't necessarily think miners themselves will do something bad to the ecosystem but a gov or bigger entity could decide to force them to adopt certain rules at the expense of the users if a central mining point is created.

There are multiple ways to "cripple" a working product. Increasing the blocks size too quickly will cripple bitcoin's centralization. Not increasing it will cripple transactions. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 17:12:35
I wouldn't base it on the mempool since it could be manipulated by spamming transactions. I would think that proposing a fork where block sizes will increase, say from 1MB to 2MB in a predictable number of blocks be a fair proposition to the community.

Sounds like a 2nd bcash
@_date: 2018-01-28 12:46:38
Interesting to note. If bcash blocks did not provide any reward right now, there would be almost no incentive to mine it where the Bitcoin blocks are already more interesting to mine even without the block reward. (because of transaction fees)
There's a balance to meet in this eco system to keep in check.

Tbh didn't read it all. But for me all the value coming from bitcoin is true decentralization period. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:47:40
bcash doesn't even have close to BTC volume still. Even with 8mb blocks they are barely ever getting above 400kb of transactions. I'm all for free market to choose but people aren't stupid. They know the solution bcash proposed is not sustainable for true decentralization.

It's just funny to go back in time to check what were people's expectations in terms of price. Nobody knows where this is going. This guy obviously had really conservatives numbers back in August and this prediction so far did not age well. :)
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:19:47
They have created no incentives to use LN as opposed to onchain transactions. If fees are too similar, users won't know what is the difference. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:10:35
Indirectly, running a full node does help financially if it keeps one's btc investments decentralized. If that's what you believe the value comes from. 
I don't really mind ASICs, I believe it to be the free market finding clever ways to make profits which shows that you can still be creative in finding ways to mine more efficiently.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:07:38


Uh. Sounds like something Bitcoin Cash CEO Roger Ver would say as an argument.
And you are right, creating division among users have always been a great way for major compagnies to milk more profits.

It will be completely invisible in the end. It might comes in different phases but ultimately my wallet will show a balance and you won't know it but it might very likely be money already inside a channel unless specify commits by the user. I have no idea how the devs are going to handle it, there are multiple solutions to this but the only way I see this work is to keep it like I just send funds to people and it just works.

@_date: 2017-12-18 21:05:31
BCH is a linear answer to scaling Bitcoin. While that answer may hold value short term. When you do the maths, their solution will not be sustainable in the long term. 
Growing frustration from high fees will make this coin rise in value somewhat but I believe it will be short lived.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:30:11
Per address yes. But yo can have multiple address tied to one wallet and multiple private keys tied to a seed.

Well it's not just storage.. bandwith too has to follow.
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:01:37
It just needs to scale to be used as a currency. The market will then decide if it wants to use it as such.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:55:16

shh let them sell. I need cheap Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:48:49
We can't. The incentive has to be put on offchain transactions. No fees for onchain transactions will remove that incentive. 
The reason we want most transactions offchain is to keep the blockchain from growing too much to a point where most people can't setup their own nodes and keep it decentralized.

I promised myself not to do this.. but it's Christmas boyz!!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:35:21
I think their goal is for wallets to work exactly like they are without you noticing you are transacting off chain. Unless you specify you want comitted funds. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:33:00
Segwit actually allow blocks to be up to 2MB in theory. Wallets and exchanges just needs the incentive to start using Segwit.

Exactly my thought. If it's not open source blockchain with independent nodes willing to run it...  better get away from it. 
People really seem to forget that the best blockchains should be trustless. 
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:56:38
No, I like my BTC with segwit sauce good sir.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:42:08
You mean it's nothing a regular database would not do?
@_date: 2018-11-14 21:59:35
Not even 1. Bro I wished I had one.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:11:04
That's assuming OP use gdax..
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:48:52
Right one.
It's always right.

A crash? We just had a 100% run up. Let the bull drink up a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:45:06
I think rally is going to Bitcoin again and the whole moon with crypto market from here.
@_date: 2018-03-02 17:20:20
So shocked, I just bought more. Keep the FUD coming.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:57:41
10K sitting in my bank account will hold less purchasing power as time goes on because new money is being printed every year (the supply change and so is my purchasing power). 
Now, I could invest it to make interest so that it could either hold its value or be more valuable but this can again be offset by whom is in control of the money supply. 
Then you have debt levels to take into account. How much in debt each gov needs to get for another Greek crisis to occur in other countries that have a high degt to income ratio? 
Buying in crypto for me is hedging against the dollar in the same way Gold and Silver would except that the state cannot easily take crypto away from one individual.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:41:33
With a credit card.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:05:19
It is definetly not a scam. It's an experiment. If it fails, lots of people are going to lose a lot of money. 
The technology is here to stay, people here are just betting on which token will stay and frankly, bitcoin has a lot of attributes that are enviable in this ecosystem. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:15:48
Reddit paidshills to spread FUD. I love them for making BTC go on sale.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:34:48
My magic ball says yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:56:52
It has to be as low as possible. Because then they can bet it that it will rise with more confidence.
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:14:47
LOL bcash.

I'm an expart.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:16:05
Why not? I would happily hear your point of view.
@_date: 2018-02-15 12:40:47
You got it wrong. The goal of BTC is introducing sound money in a world where money supply is being manipulated globally. (An exit system when abuse occurs)
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:48:45
Holding non physical cryptographic keys will be considered somewhat illegal? So much for human rights.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:24:54
Cross chain swaps, Schnorr Signatures and MimbleWimble will help keeping the transactions anonymous. I just don't want to save for a dollar that a 3rd party can print endlessly at will.
@_date: 2018-03-31 12:29:14
Bascially they would have to force developers to get a release of the btc hardfork software to increase cap and then force more than 51% of nodes and miners around the world to run it. 
Yea.. very unlikely.
@_date: 2018-03-02 18:10:15
Buy Bitcoins on internet explorer use the same narrative.

ok another one for you. USD has been used to buy cp. Why are you still using USD?

FEELS GOOD MAN.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:30:52
I only buy when I'm really scared to do so. Paid off well so far.
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:10:58
Well you got it wrong.
Right now I'm shaking a lot.. so I'm going to convert some fiat into BTC for sure.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:37:34
Both are actually being worked on.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:12:48
From what I read there will be an autopilot. But they are still tweaking it to create mutliple routes to avoid centralized hubs or at least have other routes created in case a central hubs does occur and start censoring transactions on LN.
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:29:40
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:36:29
They were too busy implementing bcash.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:22:17
Make BTC cheap again!

China and their juciest fud.
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:08:31
The currency is expensive to produce. What's the problem with that?
Creating new bitcoins is not meant to be easy.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:18:25
Didnt know India could produce the same juicy quality FUD than China.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:27:58
It all makes sense considering a lot of ICO scams are around using all kinds of service to achieve their pump and dump. 
You wouldn't want to be pointed as one business that has facilitated these scams.
@_date: 2018-03-07 00:48:17
Who cares about the NYC coin tho.
@_date: 2018-03-02 12:45:18
It should be the other way around. Your gold will be backed by BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:37:14
And batching?
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:04:21
I can't even track the amount of forks happening. By the time the gov figures it out sent a notice there will be 50 more forks that they need to deal with. This is so riduculous that I don't think it will ever be enforced or perhaps on only specific forks that held on some meaningful value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:36:39
The tech isn't the only thing to mesure I believe. There is the community, developpers, merchant support, decentralization, roadmaps, etc. 
I find BTC to be very elegant and simple where ETH requires me to do way more research to understand its current value proposal. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:14:15
I don't know who to believe anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:25:13
As much as I love Bitcoin. It would be irresponsible for a country to buy a large amount of crypto using their citizen taxes. 
That being said, people and gov should start thinking about having a small % of holdings in crypto currencies for greater diversification.
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:29:27
Great. Now start planning for LN support.
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:29:10
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:43:33
This is an attack to Bitcoin.
Even thought competitors tries to use its name, the trade offs of licensing the name is not worth it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:33:27
I keep buying because I don't really want to see that happens.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:50:15
Feels good man.

With only 50$. You'll get rekt by fees if you plan on day trading.

Or be civilised and don't write on paper money and use vocal arguments?
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:56:34
Lots of HODLers out there.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:30:21
I agree with your statement, but they are right this time. Block propagation wouldn't work well at a certain block size and will surely centralized the system. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:12
Yea man, I'm out of fiat, can't buy this dip and it makes me sad.
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:17:38
I think the dumping already started..
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:07:24
That's because every satoshi is more valuable in USD on Bitcoin than Bitcoin Cash.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:12:58
I'm only selling when it hits 2K. Gotta make sure there's still enough for one of those sex dolls you can buy with BTC I heard about.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:36:41
Sells faster with close to 0 fees?
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:03:07
Lol. If it's open source we can just copy it.

Juicy FUD is juicy.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:17:40
I mean, If I was in this business and wouldn't want to risk my current balanced sheets funds on Bitcoin...I would let my customers bring the capital flow for me to buy in.. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:10:40
The problem is when you introduce financial rules in a system where trusted 3rd party will enforce it. Software rules run by miners apply to everyone all the time.

I don't really get why we want to associate it with a generation. It's just better money for all generations that wants in.
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:23:08
Exactly this. Don't sell back to fiat but buy things with btc whenever you can :)
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:11:18
There are peeps right now paying 11k usd knowing this. Therefore if people are willing to pay 11k USD it must be worth at least that?

Give them back their fiat lol. BTC should be spent on goods and services for it to flourish, not taxes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:57:07
Only if your banks allows you to withdraw that paper money. The goal of BTC is to get rid of that trusted 3rd party.

Check well the source of where you buy your mining equipment. Lots of scams out there. check a crypto mining profitability online to see if you at least break even with your energy fees.
Good luck and thanks for trying to help in making mining more decentralized.

No one use bcash either. They can't barely ever fill 1 MB blocks
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:27:20
BTC itself is distributed and decentralized. It doesn't mean this subreddit has to. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 10:06:03

Hi full mempool, long time no see!
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:57:30
That's why they praise it. They make money off it. Would it be suprising that they would use these new earnings to buy Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:58:16
These rules are for average.. maybe the average is meh with credit.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:25:22
Have money rdy for the dip. 
Btw, the way to tell the end of a dip is when you are so scared of buying that you are starting to think BTC is dying. 
Worked well for me the last few times.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:03:51
You know they said the same thing about fingerprint sensors for smart phones

Born in it, molded by it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:36:31
That's just the continuation of a vicious cycle. It won't end at de-anonymised, they will regulate it to a point where they will require to hold the funds on your behalf (just like a bank) and then before you know it we'll be back on square one. BTC will hold some kind of value just because it is outside the traditionnal financial markets juridictions.
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:08:11
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:39:14
Sad. I love their service.. I hope they don't get into these political games. Anything that hardforked off bitcoin is not bitcoin.

I'm failing to see how something that went from 1K to 9K in one year is dying.
1 year is not even the bigger picture.

Right! Stabbing my lambo dreams everyday.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:25:47
Nope. 
All I see is people losing their shit.

@_date: 2018-02-14 01:43:19
I would give up on crypto... would rather see LTC or ETH take over. At least they have some real developments going on.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:47:06
I miss the memes
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:18:27
That's their problems. You are not investing in crypto, you are effectively gambling.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:18:33
Well yes and no, people would be able to keep up the old build on their nodes if they don't aggree with the software upgrades they propose by consensus. Unless Microsoft proposes a change that basically destroy the old chain. (wonder if that's possible)
@_date: 2018-03-23 00:54:35
Even if btc was evenly distributed from day one, individuals would sell products and eventually become whales.

Hey let me sound nice too Pal.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:57:57
I would like to answer this properly but I'm tired to hear these silly arguments all over again.
Do whatever the fuck you want.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:02:55
Right, I still got to pay rent. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:34:34
Lol do you know how many people will be buying like crazy before it even reach 4K.
But by all means, wait it out until 500$ I don't believe we will see that price tag on bitcoin again ever.
But lets entertain the idea that it does, I would buy a shitload of BTC at those levels.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:03:20
..wait how?
@_date: 2018-02-22 12:55:54
Then they fight you..
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:38:16
When some merchants around you begin to accept it. Simply convert a small % of your salary into btc annd use it whenever at that place.
If everyone did that.
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:07:08
Good thing they did, now we can see it fail without  it affecting Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:39:59
Never said 19.9K was more valid. I can give it a personal value if I want. But it's the collective perspective of its value that gives it its true value so my opinion is worthless on the value.

@_date: 2018-02-17 11:15:14
The world is not what it used to be no no no
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:25:35
A couple of whales dump enough BTC and tell their fud campaign to start shortly after with a couple of social media FUD accounts spamming. That might do it.
Edit: Think about it. These whales sell at 19K to buy their BTC back around 7K or below. Rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:32:37
You think my hodl powers is that weak? 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:01:38
Trying to catch a falling knife is tough and not recommended.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:32:10
I'm confused. I buy and sell at the same time?
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:38:53
The main invention behind bitcoin is resolving the double spend problem. It has taken so much time to resolve and I don't think anyone will just come up with a new way to do it. 
Maybe they will find clever ways to improve it.. Bitcoin has the capacity to evolve as much as the other coins, especially on the Lightning Network.
