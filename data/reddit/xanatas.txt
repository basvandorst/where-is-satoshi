I like Bitcoin and gold for both their value and other properties. 3% markup is normal for both OTC.

the hell they dont even know how the thing works with 1,0 and both at the sime time. the two worlds of quantum computing and normal computing might not be compatible at all.

Vaultoro is 100% audited on the gold and on the bitcoin side by publicly showing cold wallet addresses and user funds. Vaultoro users can audit their holdings and the sum of all user holdings by checking against the audit documents and the bitcoin wallets.

Have the same problem. Dont know any Python though. I fully understand the concept and that electrum is using this principle. 
Is there any bitcoin client which can run on my server as watch-only wallet (copy) and my php can talk to it through the API ?
this is the only tutorial i found but wonder if this is the only way:
OR another way just use this PHP script to genrate adresses and verify transaction through third party ? (blockchain.info) ?? but not really what i want. (

you should get rid of the 30 day below the 0$ Free plan on  cause its confusing and might lead to people believing its not free after that time period

I agree on simplyfying. But i think the QR codes are pretty convenient even for simple "names" i would use the camera wherever possible.
Maybe just a "hashing" algorithm what hashes a bitcoin address into a clear name an the other way around. kinda hard... im not a algortihm guy :D

I mean is there any law that prevents you selling your land say... for a rare guitar?
Bitcoin is a "thing" with a worth and in most countries you have to pay tax when you get en equivalent worth of something. 
see bartering laws of your country.

Dont blame the player, blame the game.
Its actually pretty complex to implement global banking relations/solutions at low cost. But there are solutions out there (Transferwise).

get some gold on Vaultoro :). Gold is also going up
@_date: 2019-03-29 08:49:12
Gold is a something you buy as part of your portfolio. Diversification is key to get over financial or currency crisis. gold should be part of it. any hard assets should be part of it. also stocks bonds and crypto of course.
If you live in the US okay the us dollar has survived a long time. but the average lifespan of a currency is not that long. 30-40 years i believe if you take out very unstable economies. In Europe the introduction of the new EURO came with a massive devaluation of ones savings (around 50%).

I actually mined Bitcoin on my graphics card back then and sold them for 30$ each...yeah!!! :D

Never buy gold from a bank.
If you want to diversify into in the age of crypto just use vaultoro... 100% your property, stored in swiss vault, insured and all. I dont know why people buy gold and have it at home. its way more insecure.
@_date: 2015-08-31 11:54:26
Of course "at" the crisis gold prices will also go down. but its a matter what to own after the crisis. paper will be worthless.
people have already run to bitcoin or on vaultoro you can do both..physical and bitcoin, i like gold anyway, prices do fluctuate also but historically i trust it more that fiat obviously.

citi are the most corrupt i always felt
@_date: 2017-04-11 15:45:42
Totally agree. An educational analysis of where "value" comes from is much more needed than just comparing assets and saying X is better than Y.

Of course there is not, its just not possible. Unless your POS is accepting bitcoin directly no "decentralized (powered)" purchase is possible. 
And why even promote a "card". Promote accepting bitcoin directly, you do not need a card then.
A card is just a way to change to fiat before paying. 
A "decentralised" card, if you want to call it that, can never work.
What could work is your normal card linked to  your bank account and an exchange service which recognizes the sale, takes the bitcoin to from your phone to directly exchange to fiat at an exchange and deposit directly into your bank account after purchase.

at vaultoro.com do you can exchange bitcoin and gold, there is also bitreserve.com. they both go in physical gold stored in vaults. there are more offers also to buy physical gold for you home. everybody has different aspects, fees, transparency etc.
@_date: 2015-09-24 11:11:47
Vaultoro! Its real gold in a vault! Even a trading platform!
@_date: 2018-04-24 07:57:53
I love gold, I love Bitcoin, I dont love these headlines.
The article is not bad! But the headline...
its like "Fruit lovers are increasingly choosing oranges over pears" and the article is not even talking about that.
Bitcoin is not the "new" gold. sure there is a rush. But gold got its value since 3000 years. I see crypto as another great  asset class thats also useful.
I have both.. vaultoro.com :D
@_date: 2015-10-09 09:25:49
the last. If you can take bitcoin out, thats another story. The Bit in the name is misleading.
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:42:19
Dropping gold as store of value or investment makes NO sense at all. diversification is key. have bitcoin, have gold.
@_date: 2016-07-18 15:26:05
I get your point but for the WHY they can not tell you because government regulation says so. This is true for most money handlers. If your account is under investigation for unusual activity (whatever algorithm), the exchange is forbidden to tell you why or what or how long the investigation is ongoing. There are also differences by country etc. So this might be the case here. Same goes for Coinbase by the way. 
Your support ticket experience is another thing though they could tell you what i just wrote.
