Basically about a year ago this site got released as a visualizer in an attempt to show how BCH was better then BTC in terms of transaction volume and fees. Pretty much instantly all it did was show how much more BTC is used and really just did the opposite of what they wanted
I don’t blame you if you don’t know what it is, it’s a pretty old site/joke on this sub
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:37:32
I’ve tapped many buttons and many links but no luck in finding a fee setting. From the looks of their support page, there is none.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:23:33
It’s all I have in coinbase. I have more elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:37:17
So there’s no way to alter the fee or remove it some other way? I sent some funds from electrum for about 100 satoshi. Of course it took awhile but I was only going between wallets so I didn’t mind. Is this possible with coinbase?
@_date: 2019-07-20 22:16:09
Holy shit it’s the hodl rant all over again
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:46
This sounds like a set up for a really crap stand-up joke
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:02:43
Bitcoin boutta do a 51% attack on all of crypto
@_date: 2018-08-02 23:06:15
Ok this we need more of this
@_date: 2018-08-02 05:06:32
I just saw the words bull and bear and thought “yep sounds about right” and went with it��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-05-13 04:09:44
That’s a nice decentralized system you got there, would be a shame if someone were to... centralize it
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:44:43
Bticoin is still doing everything from the white papers right? Now with some stuff added but nothing removed or changed?
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:15:32
Ok. And in the hypothetical situation that bitcoin becomes the main currency, it’s growth of value will only be compared to other currencies. If those currencies are insignificant, wouldn’t it be better to invest in things that give you more bitcoin than just allow the value of what you have rise? Rather than letting your 10 bitcoin be worth more USD, wouldn’t it be better to get 20 bitcoin? Again, for now this may be untrue, but in a future scenario where bitcoin is THE money, it seems it would be used as normal.
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:07:32
Hold up. How is everyone’s blue going down good but everyone’s value going up bad?
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:34:25
Well presumably it would be fine. Risks will always have to be taken, deflationary or inflationary.
@_date: 2019-08-02 02:20:25
Good point. I was so focused on security if someone had physical access I totally forgot about something just waiting until all that encryption went away
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:02:15
But as bitcoin goes up in value, it makes all of that money more valuable. It’s just the inverse 
@_date: 2019-10-15 13:55:08
I’m the most simple forms yes. But I need some sort of api or pipe to move that key as a string into a wallet program
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:10:11
Well presumably since we invented cash. And just how do you expect people to, ya know, live if they’re not buying things?
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:31:07
Ok just to be clear, you’re saying bitcoin rising in value means is worth more USD or some kind s fiat, correct?
@_date: 2019-10-16 03:38:51
Looked into it. How would one import a private key with it?
@_date: 2019-08-02 06:25:18
Isn’t that what public and private keys are doing? Just encrypting and decrypting transactions so only the owner can claim them as theirs?
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:27:36
Well yeah the risk of holding onto $5 is less than the risk of investing it to. Also this is assuming 21 million bitcoin is all. Since it’s just a number, it can just keep being broken down and down as need be. Technically, it’s as infinite as a decimal place. And the only way holding bitcoin would give it more value is if there’s another currency to give it that value. If Bitcoin is the only one, then there’s nothing else to give it the value. It IS the value.

Hodl on to life first
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:05:47
You’re right. Having him see the proof himself will help.
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:08:33
This is by far the best answer yet��
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:41:50
Basically, it’s far more secure. That’s the simple answer.
@_date: 2018-03-08 01:28:29
You were *this* close to making an “outside the block” joke and you... you just wiffed it
@_date: 2018-03-26 02:39:31
Ok but the thing is you’re not wrong and that scares me
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:10:43
Considering how widespread it is now it’s very weird seeing a sourceforge download and windows only. What a long way Bitcoin has come
@_date: 2019-01-07 07:09:56
This... this is the content I came to this sub for
@_date: 2018-03-15 04:24:25
Well to be fair 20k was very brief. A more accurate version would probably be around 15 or even 12k. Still quite the dip though.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:13:58
Maybe like a can ok kidney beans with my luck
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:46:22
I’ve seen more bitcoin related ads on YouTube after this news started surfacing than I ever did before. Most of these ads are either scammy or crap ISOs so this is probably for the better.
@_date: 2018-11-26 17:44:53
For shiny reddit coins
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:20:35
If that’s the case then I’ve been technologically involved since then, in much later
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:19:08
These are awesome :D
ETH and DGE would be cool, too.
Keep up the good work! :)

I’ve been interested, watching, and learning since $600, invested much later. 5th grade me didn’t think he’d be able to convince his parents to let him buy magic internet money.
@_date: 2019-09-09 00:50:49
So what happens if you invoice for an amount more than the one on screen? It’s it error or just send the max? I’ve been lost in the whole lightning thing so I apologize if this is a dumb question
@_date: 2019-09-26 14:15:04
I’ve been in bitcoin since $600. By now I’m long into the mindset of just sit back and enjoy the chaos
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:56:31
How’s that? Some bad guy promoting the coin isn’t the fault of the coin. It’s simply an altcoin. The same as litecoin or any other. People will use the coin if they prefer it, and if you don’t, then you don’t. After all, if everyone settled on one currency and one system we wouldn’t have Bitcoin in the first place. There will be trials, winners, and losers. Given time, Bitcoin will fall dominant, but until that happens much will evolve and appear, and just as quickly fade out.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:25:41
The currency is fine, the tactics are scams. Well put 
@_date: 2018-04-05 04:27:42
Is this why Ledger nanos have those little holes in them? So you can put a stick in and spin them around?

Why not make the jump to 1 TB each. What could go wrong?
