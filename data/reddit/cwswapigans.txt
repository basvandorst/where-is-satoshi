Were you here in 2013? People were saying the same things almost word for word.
In 2011 it was unfathomable how well-known Bitcoin was compared to 2 years prior. In 2013 it was unfathomable how well-known Bitcoin was and how many deep pockets were involved compared to 2 years prior. 2017 is more like 2013 than 2013 was like 2011 or 2009.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:52:16
Yup, miners and those with a lot of money in BTC are two very deep-pocketed groups that have obvious incentive to sell futures. Unfortunately there aren't any large groups with obvious incentives to buy them.

You'd want to consult an accountant at that point. The rules, as I understand them, haven't really been clarified.
What you're describing is called LIFO (last in, first out) accounting. Some argue Bitcoin is not eligible for this, though I'm tentatively planning to use it.
Note that in your scenario using FIFO (treating the sale as all coming from the 2016 purchase) qualifies you for a lower income tax *rate* but would give you a vastly bigger gain that you're taxed on, since the increase from 2016 to now is much larger than the increase over a few months in 2017.
Just found this, but it looks like a good summary of the FIFO, LIFO situation: 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:04:55
This is some *serious* cherry picking.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:48:12
If you sell within a year of buying then you are taxed on your trading gain and it's treated as ordinary income. Buying back in won't matter.
If you hold it for at least a year then it's taxed as a long-term capital gain which is 15% for most filers (but can go as high as ~34% for those making high incomes and living in high tax localities).

I don't think people making bets with friends are expecting any legal enforcement. The enforcement is your friend presumably doesn't want to steal $1,000 from you, and if he does, at least you found out sooner.
What would be really interesting to me is to try to argue it's unenforceable because OP's friend didn't actually provide any consideration (OP's friend could just purchase $1K in bitcoins and have lots of upside with no risk whatsoever).
Of course OP is stupid enough that he believed he was getting something out of this. Maybe that's enough?

Really seems like less an if than a when at this point. I think it can recover but I think it may take quite a while to reach this price again (as it has in the past, particularly after the $36, the first one I saw).

Free money is still worth just as much as any other money. It's all money. It blows my mind how many people in this sub-reddit don't get that.
If you have a non-negligible net worth and you have over 50% of it (or even over, say, 20% of it really) in bitcoin then you are making a ridiculously aggressive investment decision that almost no advisor would recommend no matter how little you paid to get in or how much you believe in bitcoin.

There's a lot of systemic risk in insuring bank accounts. This isn't like auto insurance, bank failures are highly correlated with other bank failures. A few billion vs trillions doesn't do much if there's ever any real trouble.
The whole FDIC system only exists to try to reduce the chances of "real trouble" ever happening. If it actually does the FDIC can't do much at all about it.

If your full-savings amount is $16K I'd suggest you diversify. Put say 20% into BTC, 20% into gold, 40-50% into a low-fee index fund, and keep the rest in cash.

The point is that it doesn't make any sense to differentiate between spending your bitcoin and spending your USD.
If you spend 0.1 btc and it goes up, that's a shame. If you spend ~$100 instead, that's $100 that could've otherwise gone toward buying btc.
The risk is the same either way. The difference is psychological.

I sold 2/3 of my stash at 850. Definitely not crying. I paid 3 bucks for the things. Hindsight is 20/20, I'd have been better off holding, but that kind of drop in the past has almost always led to a crash.

No, you haven't. You're ignoring opportunity cost.
Option A: Bet $1000 bitcoin goes to $1000 (from ~$100). Net result today: +$1,000
Option B: Spend $1000 on bitcoin (~10 btc). Net result today: **+$9,000**
Note there is also *no* scenario whatsoever in which Option A leaves you better off than Option B. The only scenario where they even tie is if bitcoin goes to zero.
You lost $8,000 by risking $1,000 on this bet instead of on bitcoin and you did so with no possible benefit.

Yeah, I was being a bit lazy/sloppy in my phrasing and didn't get into this nuance. What you say is of course true.
Mine is not exactly wrong either. If there's a price spike and I go from holding $1K in bitcoin to $2K in bitcoin then I'm now staking twice as many dollars in bitcoin even though I never actually made a purchase. It's sort of a passive/implied injection of cash.

Higher and lower are (rather obviously) different classes of guesses, of course they're more likely. If you're guessing an exact price for a year from now then today's price is the best guess*.

@_date: 2013-11-06 20:24:27
Which then translates to $15k/btc if bitcoin entirely replaced all existing currency. In light of that the current price actually seems pretty steep. I mean do you think there's a 15% chance of them replacing even 10% of existing currency use? That's what the current value would seem to suggest to me. 
I've been into btc since 2011 but I'm definitely holding rather than buying right now. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:21:14


Yes, but the best guess is today's market price. It's not that complicated. If you had $10K in btc and now you have $5K then you're out $5K today. Where you'll end up is unknown, sure, but so what?

I'd bet she filed one for you, especially since your final $8K is *juuust* starting to flirt with the $10K limit. $10K requires an IRS form, structuring is a crime of making multiple withdrawals of less than $10K to try to skirt this.

Nitpicks on your examples aside, bitcoin is a means of exchange in addition to a currency. The former is obviously where its value comes from. 
Anyway, that stability *is* plausible with bitcoin, it would just have to reach an extremely high level of adoption. The USD and all other fiat currencies can fluctuate quite a bit (you didn't really think oil, corn, sugar, steel, and paper were all *coincidentally* going up and down together, did you?). You'll never see much shock from these fluctuations because prices and salaries are denominated in dollars.

I'm honestly surprised this whole thread hasn't been about how OP is a moron. If he bought $1,000 in btc instead of making this thread then he comes out better off in *every possible scenario* (except btc going to $0 in which case it's a push). In many scenarios, including the one that actually happened, OP would be **much** better off having bought the btc instead of making the bet.

Well, there's also intrinsic value (my Chiefs poster is valuable even if I don't trade it), but point taken. 
Unfortunately point also largely irrelevant. If the price of BTC goes down 30% then our expectation for what the value will be at the time of the trade goes down 30%.

That depends. My current paper wallet is from bitaddress.org. It has the wallet address printed on it and if you cut open the sealed container I've placed it in, it has a private key printed on it. It's a pretty obvious thing to steal and it's pretty obvious what to do with it once you have.

Fwiw, it's a very old saying (50+ years):
"If you lend someone $20 and never see them again, it was probably worth it."

What are the fees like on those? Fees can just eat you alive. I'd expect their returns other than fees to be fairly competitive, but not positive there either.
It's getting into your own personal ideas of morality but you might be better off with a Vanguard index fund and giving a portion of it to an very efficient charity (like basic medical needs in Africa).

With interest rates being so low on a mortgage, and the interest being tax-deductible, this isn't always the best plan (though it's not a terrible one).
Plus if he lives in a major metro that money isn't even sniffing a home.

If you bought at $1 and sold at $1 then you have no tax liability in the US.

That adds some nuance but doesn't change anything. He's still on the hook for $1,000 (I'm curious what his plan was to pay his friend it btc crashed since according to him he didn't have $1,000 in non-btc) no matter what.
If he's able to pay off his friend (kind of in question I guess) then he's able to put more money into btc if he didn't bet with his friend. Anyway, yes, if he's willing to bankrupt and stiff his friend he can get back into a scenario equally as good as not making the bet at all.

Ask someone "How much is one yuan worth?" and you'll get answers back such as the current price in USD, or whatever the real currency is in their location.
