I'm in a developed country and have no real incentive to use bitcoin. Bitcoin is not a tool against credit card debt. Debit cards have been around for forever and are actually accepted everywhere. 


I don't understand what this means. Own myself? I'm not trying to make a statement or stick to the man when it comes to finances. I'm fine with regulation because it ultimately protects consumers like me...

My credit card gives me at least 2% cash back on all purchases. In some categories, I can get up to 6% cash back. I also get a bunch of extra benefits (warranty extension, ability to do a chargeback, guaranteed returns, etc).

I can send money for free through PayPal as long as I use a bank account as the funding source.
I have literally never had to do an ACH bank transfer in my life.
I can't foresee a situation where I would need to liquidate/send $20,000. No one has that much money in their bank account. People who have $20,000 lying around usually invest them in stocks, mutual funds, etc.

I guess I can wait for this to happen, however, I already get great rewards from my credit cards. Up to 6% cash back on certain categories, extended warranties, ability to issue chargebacks, etc. I find it hard to believe that merchants accepting bitcoins will be able to match all these advantages.
I also am not big on economics and really don't think inflation is big risk factor for the USD. Besides, bitcoin's history shows much wilder ups and downs. 
I also am not sure I want to engage in currency speculation.
Lastly, I'm not a big fan of the whole tipping model. To me, it seems like cyber begging :P

I'm not super new to bitcoin (I've heard about it and have a basic understanding of how it works). I'm not sure I understand why anyone living in a country with a developed economy would want to use it. If I'm in the US and don't care about anonymity, why should I use Bitcoin?

I don't feel like these "controls" would affect most people. Very few people have enough money to raise red flags when transferring cash. 
Out of curiosity, do you actually feel like this affects you? How much money do you have (invested in Bitcoin or otherwise)? Have you ever encountered these issues when using the traditional banking system?

I'm not a big fan of tipping. Seems a bit like cyber begging to me. 
Additionally, it looks like claiming this $0.0000047837 would take far more time/trouble than it's worth.

Of course, I always pay on time :) Everyone has to be responsible for paying off their own debts and managing their financial situations. I'm fine with my rewards being paid for by other people who don't pay off their balance every month. Credit cards also subsidize the "free money" by charging merchants and I pay an annual fee on some of my cards.
Most businesses love using credit cards. They can negotiate great terms with credit card providers and can get up to 2% in cashback. Most businesses are capable of paying off their balances monthly to avoid paying interest.

This seems reasonable, however, it is a pretty niche situation. Aside from the fact that most US workers don't have European employers, I imagine finding one that pays in Bitcoin is a real challenge. I did some freelance for a foreign company once and they did Paypal. They would not be interested in learning about Bitcoin as I was the one paying fees.
As to your other points: I'm really comfortable shopping online with my credit cards. Credit cards are protected against fraud and in many cases, you have 0 liability for fraudulent charges. If you someone gets the credentials for your bitcoin wallet, there is no safety net.
I have yet to see any business offer worthwhile discounts which tempted me to get bitcoin. Newegg/Overstock are respectively niche/overpriced. Additionally, savvy shopper like myself can generally save more with credit card cashback and other non-bitcoin promotions.

Er... crowdfunding? Kickstarter and indiegogo both has solid platforms and strong userbases in this area. 
I find it hard to believe anyone looking for crowdfunding would limit themselves to a bitcoin focused platform. Heck, I remember reading that even some Bitcoin company was raising funds for their product on indiegogo!
