Bought some at 1000, 2300, 5200, 8300, 16500, and 11500.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:36:45
Without a doubt. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:36:35
LOL. This cracked me up. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:38:40
Of course not, just a second mortgage. I'm not stupid. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:36:09
If it doesn't hold 10,000, I'm guessing it will go to $8,500.
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:49:25
This is what happens with no regulation. This kind of thing is illegal in the stock market, and was supposedly the cause of the flash crash in August of 2015.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:07:58
LOL, came here to say the same thing. C/C++ is a very powerful and flexible language. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:21:00
Buying bitcoin for cash is not the same as mining. Also, yes you can buy $100 of bitcoin. Bitcoin is divisable up to 8 decimal points, so you can buy 0.0000001 bitcoin which currently trades for about 0.00017 USD.

It almost seems like the big whales are running it up days before just for that purpose. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:47:39
In 20 years... sure, why not.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:48:07


What dip? It is still 16k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:12:30
Sure they could, buy why would they want to gamble with their employees' paychecks? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:10:31


Their a business which needs income/cash flow so that they can spend to pay employees and developers. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:13
They try poloniex or binance or anyone of the other exchanges that BTC is trading for way less than coinbase or gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:22
This is quite interesting. I didn't realize the BTC limitations were actually intentional. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:54:59
Is mining not follow a logarithmic curve? Each coin gets harder to mine and it will take an infinite amount of time to mine all of them?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:17:14
My biggest worry is how long it would take to transfer from Kraken to coinbase, and how much the price changes during that time. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:39:26
Well if you are of retirement age and have a reasonably sized retirement portfolio, having 250k in fiat would be quire reasonable. That would be like 12.5% of a $2M retirement portfolio.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:55:11


That's what I told my new girlfriend. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:24:57


No they won't
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:10:13
You should tell that to the stock market. It has been going up for centuries. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:21:11
Where are people seeing these highs? I'm watching poloniex and haven't even seen it break 16K, same with binance. Why does coinbase/gdax have such a high premium? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:58:42
You really should think in percentages. Going from 1k to 2k is a much bigger move than going from 14k to 15k. If a bitcoin was 500k a 4k move would be almost nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:14
Exactly. My Dad just visited me and ask me about bitcoin, but he most certainly hasn't bought any and more than likely wont any time soon.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:03:56


This! Most people I know have heard about bitcoin by now due to all the news. Very few know what it actually is and how it works, and even less than that actually own any. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:34
It is a common saying, just google it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:39:27


I thought the lighting network went live yesterday.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:02:51
Just imagine going from having a half million to 30k in just a few days. Would wreck havoc on most peoples psyche. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:12:00
That would require another fork, so then you would have BCH and BCH2 tokens. That just seems like kicking the can down the road.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:46:36


I'm almost positive that this is the answer. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:17
Going up a little too fast for my liking. With the futures market opening right around the corner seems to be skyrocketing at just the right time to short when futures become available. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:59:43
I could easily see a 60-80% correction in the next year.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:23:09
Cool, thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:56:10
can you send from coinbase to gdax for free?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:54


That is not really true. Gold is a good store of value, but there almost no merchants that accept gold as a standard form of payment. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:56:36


google mtgox. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:08:31
You must have owned BTC before the fork, so they are finally giving you access to the BCH that should have been yours the day the fork happen.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:12:18
A stock market correction is considered 10 percent. Different markets have different definitions of what a correction would be.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:53:36
You should buy 20 BTC
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:53
It is significantly cheaper on all exchanges not name gdax or coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:24:19


Yeah, sure thing buddy. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:01:07


I think the expectation is money will move from USD (or other fiats) and gold, etc. to BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:09:39
Might as well take advantage before regulations are added.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:00:28
and to take some of your profits when you are up huge and would be willing to kill yourself if you lost them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:12:38
I agree with you. If it went down to 10 or 11k, that would be a correction.
@_date: 2017-03-03 21:13:32
What is happening March 13th?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:16:35
I'm not positive but I believe those are just when people want to sell them for, i.e. bids from limit orders, not actually what they are selling them for at this moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:23:48
Well you can sell it for a us dollar
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:05:40
Where is here? 6 months doesn't seem very long to me. Seems like it should probably be a couple years minimum. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:55:43
None, that's my point. Why get excited to buy at the same price it was a couple days ago?
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:24:21
Why would a lawyer want to take it from him? He said his girlfriend not his wife.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:29:36
You could have gotten in at 9600 a couple days ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:10


This kind for pullback happens like every week.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:55:42
Investing money has a completely different impact on the economy that spending your money to buy an item or service. 
@_date: 2018-03-21 22:53:02
They actually did make a profit, for what I think was the first time, just last quarter.
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:23:46
Looked at the chart back in May when it crashed from $2700 and told my self I would buy more at 1800. Didn't and now have much regret. Not as much as when I told my wife (girlfriend at the time) many years ago that I should just buy $100 of BTC when 1 BTC was selling for around $5 just for fun, but never got around to looking into it. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 23:05:40


So wouldn't that make you think that possibly at some point these people who work at institutions will start to bring their crypto investing/trading to their work to outperform their peers?
@_date: 2017-05-26 22:38:46
short term sellers, aka scalpers. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 04:51:29
Thanks. Just messed around with Electrum and sent a small amount from coinbase just to get a handle on how transfering bitcoins and the blockchain works. Hardware wallets really do seem to be the best was store btc safety. 
What would be the reason to get two wallets? Can you mirror a single wallet on two hardware wallets, or would the idea be to store some of your btc in one wallet and some in another to "not put all your eggs in one basket" so to speak?
Also any particular reason for Ledger vs Trezor or KeepKey? An open source hardware wallet seems like it would be safer unless you really trust Ledger.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:26:45
Thank you very much for the info. 
A few more questions. You mention a 24 word from the Recovery sheet. Is the same as the PIN code you mentioned? Also a little confused about all the talk of 12-word recover phrase, and now you are talking about a 24 word phrase. Are these different things? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:28:05
Oh well, now that was a $2M lesson.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:45:00
So the 12-word recovery phrase can be used to recover your wallet even if my hardware wallet breaks and the hardware wallet manufacture does not exist any more?
If that is the case what is the purpose of the hardware wallet? Just to make it easier to have access to your bitcoins rather than having to restore it every time using the 12-word recovery phrase?
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:36:19
Looks like a cup, might want to wait for a handle at this point.
