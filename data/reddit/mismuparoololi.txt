I'm also using Swedbank Estonia, last deposit made on 16th of July and it went through.
I'm thinking maybe these changes might be the response to the money laundering accusations (which had nothing to do with bitcoin).

For what it's worth I've made some layers that can be of help.
[BIP39 words highlighed]( 
included words here which were originally starting with a capital letter, but lowercase version would qualify.
One thing that I noticed when highlighting those, was that it felt at least to be more likely to find valid words around the white borders, as if someone deliberately put them there.
[Clues highlighted + BIP39 words]( 
With pink I've noted the clue words, although transaction doesn't qualify as BIP39 word.
Also [BIP39 layer]( with transparent background if you'd like to overlay it on your own image.

Sure, it would mean that the author (deliberately) put it there.
As far as I know there's only the notdef symbol that was not in the white paper.

I just found it interesting. Removed it for the sake of clarity so only OP's hints remain.
My thought process was to just have some "landmarks" marked there. Based on the comments around here I started to think maybe the puzzle has something to do with Elliptical Curve addition. Don't know much about it, but infinity point noted with O (netwOrk) and lambda used to mark tangent caught my eye.
