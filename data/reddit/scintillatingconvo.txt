That's Jordan saying bitcoin is a scam, not explaining how to manipulate bitcoin or other securities with low funds.
I read Jordan's book (and the movie was good, too), but they used a lot of funds, and/or controlled nearly all of the stocks they manipulated. You also can't do any of Jordan's schemes from then today, because we've made it illegal. I'm genuinely curious how to promote/manipulate today, and would devour books on it. The last time I knew really well how manipulation worked was 2014, and techniques have changed. I also have no idea how anyone could manipulate the bitcoin market without controlling a Winklevossish fraction of the bitcoin in existence.

That's called nationalization or privatization, and is usually done by a dictator.
Socialism only exists on a spectrum with capitalism at the opposite extreme, and socialism is usually where a democratic government takes ownership and responsibility of more things, whereas capitalism is where private entities take ownership and responsibility of more things. There is no pure capitalism nor pure socialism. Sometimes, socialism happens not at the level of a government, but at the firm level, where workers within a firm gain ownership and control over the firm. America has socialist things like Medicaid, Medicare, the military, and the Post Office. America also has capitalist things like WalMart and Amazon.
Socialism cannot happen in a dictatorship, so China, Russia, and Cuba are definitely NOT socialist and have never been socialist in the least. Venezuela is attempting socialism, and have what appears to be a mostly democratic government, but there are enormous external forces acting on those people trying to govern themselves, so I wouldn't place the majority of the blame on the peoples' government for the outcomes we're seeing.
Your point is valid. But we do have words for stealing peoples' businesses, such as theft, privatization, or nationalization. And, in the case of Venezuela, we're not defining political philosophy by its outcome. I would say Venezuela is attempting to be socialist. Maduro isn't a dictator. There is a real, democratically-elected congress.
It's interesting that you label bad actions by corporations as "not capitalist". In my view, we socialize sectors where private interests wouldn't be aligned with public interests.

No, the United States isn't $20T in debt.
The United States Federal Government has total debt of about $21T.
The majority of which is held by Americans.
Perhaps it's a reason to panic, perhaps not. I personally see no bright line where $19T is fine and dandy, but $25T is wayyyy too much. Why do you think interest payments will rise? How much do you expect them to rise by? Why do you think that will be a big problem?
A balanced budget isn't necessarily a good thing. Deficits and surpluses are good in different contexts.
A balanced budget would just leave the national debt at around $20T. It wouldn't bring it down.
What amount of total government debt is OK to you?
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:41:28


Generally unlikely.


No. Teachers' pay is not a meaningful part of the government budget. To lower the deficit, a congress would have to collect more taxes, or cut the big spends, which are social security (not an easy sell), medicaid/medicare (very efficient programs that are also politically impossible to cut), or military (totally do-able, and liberals want to, but conservatives would never).


The government gets to manage the interest rate, and if they come back to, say, 7%, then all the government debt at fixed rates under 7% is good (at least within the context that deficit = bad).


I generally agree, but I'm curious relative to what you think it must stop growing. GDP, inflation, interest rates, some combination thereof?
I also agree that it's not super informative to describe debt servicing as a fraction of total budget, because budget can increase, and make debt servicing appear smaller than it is.
I was pointing that out to put context around what you said, which wasn't accurate:


According to wikipedia, interest was $263B in 2017.


I think your number is right.
Why not save $100 - $1,000 billion per year on single-payor healthcare?
Why not aggressively cut spending on military? Total spending is well over $600 billion annually.
I feel like it's somewhat misleading to call taxes collected by a government "revenues". I know the tax collectors call themselves the internal *revenue* service, but a government's purpose isn't to earn a profit, and it won't go bankrupt in the same way a private firm does. Calling taxes collected "revenues" and government spending "the budget" implies like government revenues should be increased, and government budget should be decreased. That's very loosely true, but it's much less true than it is for a private firm or an individual citizen earner/consumer. It's misleading to analogize government with private firms or households, because they have very different goals and purposes, different possible behaviors and leverage, and very different failure conditions to avoid.

Do you think that government debt is literally our children and grandchildren's debt?
Even if Americans hold the government's debt?
What about if our children and grandchildren move to foreign countries?
What if our children and grandchildren aren't big millionaires or billionaires, and therefore don't pay very much taxes, relative to most Americans, over their lifetimes?
What if our children and grandchildren get more benefit from the USFG than they pay in taxes?
What if we do some math and make sure that rounded to the nearest budget year, based on actuarial tables and who's actually dying, we adjust the debt ceiling to ensure every living person pays off their "share" of USFG's debt before they die? Wouldn't that make it so Americans aren't condemning their children to slavery?

Not to say I disagree. I also think Tether has a very high probability of being a scam, but I do not agree with you for the reason you're stating.
Whatever the Tether daily dollar volume, and total Tether held aren't 1:1. It's conceivable more people want Tether as btc crashes. If you look at the daily volume bars on  for tether and btc, they correlated earlier this year, although not as closely as I would expect.
When btc was $20k there was less need for Tether than there was the month before. I would only imagine there is more need for Tether now than in January. People (who don't think Tether is a scam) flee first from cryptos to Tether, then to fiat. Whether Tether is real or a scam, it's demand/market cap should keep going up either way. That it keeps going up doesn't help us disprove the hypothesis that it's legitimate.
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:43:39
At least on wikipedia, for 2017, net interest is $263B. Total spending is $4T. That makes the interest servicing debt roughly 6.6% of the budget.
If you just lump together big things that are tangentially related, such as Medicaid and Medicare, and Defense and everything military Not Defense, then it's true, but meaningless to say it's the "4th highest spending item". If you don't arbitrarily lump together things like Medicaid and Medicare, it's not the 4th highest spending item.
The amount of budget to service existing debt is certainly big, but IMHO it's not outrageous.
SS 23.5%
Military Not Defense 15.2%
Defense 14.8%
Medicare 14.8%
Medicaid 9.4%
**Interest 6.6%**


Yes, but as long as it doesn't rise precipitously relative to GDP, I don't see ever-increasing nominal debt and interest payments as a problem. Do you? The same exact words could be truthfully said of every other major government budget item. Substitute Medicare for interest. Or Social Security. Of course budget items will continue to rise in an endless cycle. Unless we have pretty serious deflation and/or negative delta in GDP.


The last time the gov't had enough to pay for its spending was 2001, IIRC. They can easily pay for the rising interest, which is &lt;7% of the budget, and ~1.4% of GDP. But, the government chooses not to pay for the entire budget with tax revenue, and usually chooses to "print" a lot of the difference. Still, some inflation from "printing" has worked just fine for a long time.
Speaking broadly, please give us good reasons why our government shouldn't continue having a deficit, or just accept that it's fine, and instead argue with more specific proposals, like, we should only spend a max of 5.5% servicing debt, as opposed to 6.5%, because _____________. It seems bizarre to just assume that what's been working is heinously wrong, and our government had better go from 6.5% to 0% ASAP, OR ELSE CATASTROPHE!


I agree with you here. Republican congress + Trump are raising the annual deficit to $1T, and no signs of coming back. That represents roughly a 4.8% increase in the total deficit annually. I expect that problems will come along, and that this trend will not continue for even 10 years, because that would probably put the government in trouble.

Sorry. When I asked you what inflation is, I meant what percent per annum, in the US, during the years you specified. You seem to believe there's a conspiracy to under-report inflation, so what are the "real" figures, and why?  
I believe multiple things can cause inflation, and I believe your definition of inflation is narrow and therefore incorrect. Inflation is partly caused by more money added to the total supply, and that's why I've asked you 3 times what share of our 2.2% inflation is caused by our QE. In other words, what's the annual contribution of QE / money supply?  
Are you aware that inflation can occur from other things besides governments "printing" money? Can you think of no recent examples where an economy suffered significant inflation despite very little or no additional money being "printed"?

Inflation doesn't change the value of assets. Where did you get the notion that increasing the *nominal* values of assets increases their value?

Yes. OP is stupid.  
If inflation helps debtors (obviously), then it must 1:1 hurt investors/debtees (I thought this was obvious also).  
The government isn't stealing from "us". Inflation is only partly in the government's control. Also, higher inflation just moves larger marginal fraction of wealth/value from debtees to debtors, and lower inflation does the opposite.  
The government *could* steal from everyone through inflation, if and when a government uses lots of new extra money to purchase assets, essentially confiscating value.  
Our inflation has been around 2% lately, which isn't the government "stealing" anything. It's mostly just normal inflation due to more Americans existing, and America as a whole trading more goods and services.

Yes, and the general masses have no wealth. Most money is "smart money", and invests, not spends, in response to inflation. I agree that people are ignorant, and the economy is leveraged on that. It's simply not true that inflation drives economic activity. Look at places with high inflation. They aren't more economically active. Economic activity can be coaxed higher by sound rule of law or sound rule of dictator (see China), plentiful resources, investment in human resources, and technological progress. For example, I have never seen people in a nation start lots of businesses because of inflation.

I'm a little confused reading your comment. I agree that inflation doesn't drive economic activity. Are you saying rich people have to consume when faced with inflation?

Fiat money isn't a Ponzi scheme. I'm clear-minded and sober. Yes, it inflates, but that's a feature for debtors and a bug for wealth owners. Yes, it's fractional reserve, so the dollars aren't worth anything intrinsically... but that's fine. None of that is a Ponzi scheme. Ponzi schemes are where early "investors'" money is used to pay "returns" (usually only on paper, but some try to cash out) to lure more "investors" in with seemingly high but fake returns. Money isn't a Ponzi scheme. Money isn't an investment, though. If you think fiat money is so bad, you can short most currencies with leverage. Fiat money is pretty nice in that it's very widely accepted, FDIC insured, and you can pay taxes with it.
Bitcoin is also nice, and has lots of advantages and some disadvantages. Money itself can't be a Ponzi scheme, although BitConneeeeeeeect, a business, was.
