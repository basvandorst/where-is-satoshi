So sorry, Mr. brrr555. I had a total brain fart there. Teach me to try to talk to someone and type at the same time. I removed the confusing spastic part.
Money in and out I see no fee, unless you accelerate it to same day, as well if you use credit card. Make cash withdraw instant, it’s 1%. Use a linked credit card, it’s 3%. Those are the only fees I’m aware of.

I do appreciate your good wishes.
After you spent most of your life, defining yourself, creating your reality, establishing yourself in a community, then BANG! You pull up stakes and declare, "I'm starting over! Time for a reboot!"
I'll readily admit that anxiety can get to me if I let it, but I'm a plucky guy.
The challenge goes all the way to ordering dinner. I ordered the "roasted duck" for dinner, but I got the tone wrong on "roasted" and ordered "rubber duck." The waiter had a good laugh at my expense but these things inevitably happen so you need to be like that duck and let it roll off your back and have a laugh along with him.
And you are right about the cheap and good food. It is so good you just sit there and make yummy noises. When you learn where to go... two different dishes and a beer set me back $6 for lunch. Some of my buddies think I'm exaggerating, so I urge them to come along so I can show them there is another reality out there, but don't be scared. Everything will turn out OK.

It's an ugly muddy green piece of paper that many are quite fixated on.
It is still good for something compared to other currencies. Yesterday I was checking overland routes from Thailand to Cambodia. The government's visa office on the border does not collect the fee in the Cambodian Real currency because it's worthless. They accept Thai Baht or US$. Not a lot of confidence in the Real when even the government won't take it.
I was so surprised when I checked into the hotel in Siem Reap that the hotel billed the room in US$.

An ATM? You must be kidding, surely. Ƀ50 is about $800,000. I donʻt think that the kitty in the ATM could take a suitcase of moolah.
Scribbling on my cocktail napkin, that's 8,000 $100 bills. Say 4 seconds per bill to insert, barring any jams or rejected bills, youʻd be standing at the ATM for about 9 hours without a potty break. Maybe heʻll need to hire a relief dollar-stuffer.
That wouldn't work here. The last time I walked past the ATM in town it said, “No BTC” on the screen.
And the markup at the ATM here is 14%, so that’d be a fee of about $112,000.

My best combo so far is a Ledger Nano S, but instead of using their bitcoin wallet, I've started using Electrum.

With the inflation rate forecast at ~1,600% for 2017, I'd be shoveling what I had into BTC as fast as I could.

Many 10s of thousands of Murkin expats use it constantly to satisfy funding levels for the Non-immigrant O Visa. (And the Aussies, Brits, French, German, Russians...) There are large populations of foreigners who use it constantly.
For certain amounts of time, one must have ฿800,000 total annual assets deposited to a Thai bank account to keep the visa valid. My fellow expats are moving $ to ฿ and back to $ frequently, many through the New York branch of Bangkok Bank.
From the Bitcoin Wiki, paragraph 2: "Historically, similar looking Unicode symbols such as the Thai Baht (฿) have been used because the Unicode standard at the time had not included a symbol for Bitcoin. The capital letter B with stroke (Ƀ) was also used in contexts where it was likely that using the Baht symbol would cause confusion."
There's a an old Medium article 2015 arguing for the change to something distinct, to Ƀ at:
I use Ƀ exclusively for clarity. I have it as auto text substitution on phones and computers. I can't take $ to Thailand, go to Super Rich to exchange for ฿, then go to coins.co.th to exchange ฿ for ฿. For some of us, more is needed.
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:16:17
That symbol is a confusing one.
฿ is for Thai Baht currency in Thailand.
Ya can't very well use that symbol as BTC on the Thai exchange, coins.co.th.
Furthermore, Kraken uses ฿ for BCH, not BTC.
So, I'll use Ƀ until there is coherency.

My guess why they need the KYC stuff is because one can profit from Cash app. And the feds must know so they can get those capital gains taxes from you.  You have cash, exchange for bitcoin.

I assume you would use Coinbase withdraw function and put in his address. It’s easy to use a phone wallet. Coinbase can be dicks with wait times.

You are very wise to know to buy used and let somebody else take the massive depreciation hit for those first few years.
At least defer buying a money pit on wheels until after the many years of globetrotting.
A buddy moved to teach at university in Bangkok. He hasn't driven in 20+ years. He always calls for a car. He's not rich, but he is rich because he's not behind the wheel staring at car butts in traffic. Just one Bangkok gridlock traffic experience (which happens daily) is all that's needed to illustrate the point. Some reasons being that few have insurance. You drive on the left, and there's dozens of mopeds buzzing around you like flies. The foreigner is always at fault. They may hit you, but it's your fault that they hit you.

As Andreas chanted so many times, "Not your keys. Not your bitcoin." Coinbase and Binance are not wallets. Coinbase operates in US, Canada and Europe, so you'll be a nomad in these territories? If you jet off to Chiang Mai, you could run into difficulties.
You wrote crypto, but which ones? Coinbase as the base supports the least number of coins: Ƀ, Ł, Ξ, BCH. Therefore I'll assume you'll not be messing around with the 100s of different alts.
Being a digital nomad pretty much dictates that you'll have a laptop and smart phone. If it is, as you say, just a small amount, depending on the coin, a phone wallet would suffice. (And not the Coinbase app; that is not a wallet.) The wallet should be autonomous. You own the keys if the wallet has you record the 12 seed words.

Yes, the spread can be a hit for sure. Sometimes they have specials to convert from btc to thb. “This week! For the King’s birthday, move your bitcoin to baht for free!” Using “magic internet money” has the benefit that I use the magic money in the piggy bank that has ballooned by a juicy 400%, leaving my  accounts filled with that filthy fiat untouched.
I guess I could go low-tech with a briefcase full of dollars, like in those spy movies, but I wouldn’t be comfortable with the risk of seizure at customs.

This comparison is far from complete. The amount is just the basic fee for an international wire transfer. Include the fees for every time the fiat makes a hop through a different bank, the currency conversion fee, the receiving bank fee and you’re talking some serious money.
Take one example and using the rates quoted on transferwise to send the $26,000 from the US to a Thai bank to satisfy the funding requirement for a retirement visa, transferwise shows about $200. International wire transfer quotes about $1,000.
Yesterday I moved Ƀ for 1.6¢ using Native Segwit address with Electrum. (I lowballed the fee because I didn’t care about any wait time.) It’s a rare and magical moment when you send on a day when the network fee has 5 zeroes to the right of the decimal point.
Of course you all know the exchange fee is a given overhead, but it ain’t that much compared to the whopper fees above.
Simple method is to transfer to Thai exchange, cash out, deposit to Thai bank, and Bob’s your uncle. And you know how fast that can be compared to an IWT.

Signing up for an exchange could be futile. He mentions that he has no bank account, nor a credit card, nor paypal. Without any bank access, the options are: some guy on a dark street corner in chinatown, localbitcoin with an in-person meeting, or his local bitcoin ATM.
If he were to get a prepaid debit card, then the exchange option could work.
That’s a rough place to be, to have no banking instruments in a digital society. You can’t even rent a car at the airport without one. I did so last week and noticed in the terms, not even a debit card is accepted.

For example, right now the next Coinjoin is coming up in 1hr 7mn. For this round, one sends in a minimum of 0.09941889. The values can change with each round. There are 92/100 folks in the queue.
Always using odd Ƀ and $ amounts send 1.0016749 at dinnertime, for example. Get up the next morning and you should have had the Ƀ1.\~ chopped up into approximately 10 utxos. Each will have a score of how anonymized they are, by default at least 50. A few I got back had scores of nearly 200. You can repeatedly send them through for next to nothing to slice and dice and puree the Ƀ.

It's a bitcoin wallet, like all the rest. Yes, you can send Ƀ to and from the wallet.
Not clear on what the sending bitcoin and losing it means. Maybe you mean the recipient didn't receive it?
Things that could go wrong:
* Receiver gave you an address with a typo in it.
* Receiver gave you a BCH address instead of a Ƀ address to you.
* Man in the middle attack altered the address and you sent it to a Prince in Nigeria. Always verify the address.
* You were the victim of a scam where your best buddy turned out to be a rat and ran off to the Cayman Islands with your Ƀ after he convinced you to send it to him "for safekeeping."
* Maybe you entered a zero miner fee and it's caught in limbo.
* They really are out to GITCHA!
I've used Copay off and on for years and never hit a snag, never lost coin, except for the occasional too low fee that delayed a transaction for hours. Otherwise nothing was lost permanently.
If anybody tries to sell you a line to profit even more from bitcoin, run the other way.
Protect your keys from prying eyes. In the safe, on paper, never electronic form. If somebody gets a hold of it, they can take your coin at will.

I’ve not noticed any great difference in the feature set. What Android feature wows you over the iOS version? I don’t often get my hands on an Android, so don’t know what I’m missing. The only big one I notice is the lack of hardware wallet support because the wallets are microUSB, but the iPhone is lightning.
iOS version does everything I need to do. When it’s time to dump into the hardware wallet, I like set max funds option so it computes the transaction fee so the account zeroes out and 4 speed settings. I swept the private key of an OpenDime yesterday. I’m content with it.

Localbitcoins might not be your best pathway for a small amount. Most of the sellers in my city, the lowest is $100, one stand-out on the low end, $20.
They do exist, but for such a small amount, you'll pay a high price for the ƀ, around $50–100 higher than index per Ƀ.
Maybe there's a bitcoin ATM in your town...
Maybe one of your buddies in person will sell you $5 worth from phone to phone, so you can learn how a transaction plays out.

At 1 satoshi/byte, it might make it, but doubtful it will be picked up.
In this case, if not picked up in 72 hours, the transaction could be dropped and the bitcoin returned to your wallet. I've never witnessed it firsthand.
I had one transaction set too low at 10. It did clear, but took 1.5 days.

Oh! 20BF is the code you type while holding down the Option key on the Mac. In Unicode there are a bazillion other characters one can type beyond what's on the key caps of your keyboard.
In order to utilize all the codes, you first go to Keyboard Preferences, to Input Sources and add the "Unicode Hex Input" keyboard. When you are using that one, you can insert all kinds of characters. It's not just for that express purpose of inserting special characters; I'm using it right now. How about the 4-leaf clover character on your Command key left of the spacebar?

I could find no citation to support magnetism damaging a hardware wallet. I used search phrase, "do magnets damage a bitcoin hardware wallet."

I'm torn about whether it would be safe to log into Coinbase. One way to look at it is, your account is established in a legal state, so it shouldn't matter from where you log in.
What makes me hesitate is when I tried to open an account with Gemini, they detected my IP address and said sorry no, you can't do business with us.
Would it help if you set your VPN to a server in a good state, so the exchange would see you in, say, L.A. or somewhere but here?

Expat can be anything. It's a person from one country, residing in another, satisfying that country's visa process and abiding by its rules. So many types! Work, Education, Tourist, Marriage, etc. A retirement visa for Thailand expressly forbids an expat from working. By law you must be idle. If you keep busy, no money may be earned. The biggie for that one is, do you have $25,000 to park in a Thai bank?
It's much harder to be an immigrant, such as the above, plus 3 sucessive 1-year visa extensions;  screw up and you start over. Then the giant step of being there 10 years before appyling for naturalization. And do you provide an expertise to your prospective country? On and on and on... It's nerve-racking.

My testament.
I’ve been through so many services with apps on the phone.

To speed up initial setup, I got a copy of the blockchain using an iMac i5 with gobs of RAM to an external drive, then plugged it into the netbook. Getting the copy of the blockchain is the intensive part, 4 days. (It was up to the ACER to sync the wallet which took a few days on its own.)

I've not heard of bitcoin bandits robbing banks for seeds. Isn't the usual target the tellers with ready money? I've not heard of a robber going after a safe deposit box. Hundreds of boxes in a vault to choose from... which one is it?  You have to have two keys to open one.
Do they come prepared with the box number and drills to punch the locks after they tie up the staff who sign you in? That is starting to sound like a George Clooney robbing a casino in Vegas movie.

I’ve read other harbingers of doom how so many are now on the ropes and 60% of Americans can’t dig up $500 for an unexpected expense without, you guessed it, more credit card debt, and the many other nightmares that fill the pit of my stomach with a cold dread.
I got lucky and managed with discipline to zero out my CC debt, but I know so many who are on the hamster wheel of high interest and despair. I count my blessings when an article like this smacks me upside dah head to remind me.

I do understand basically how they work. I understand that you take gross income before income tax and buy bitcoin and that money used is tax deferred until you take disbursements.
When you withdraw the money it’s typically reported as income, therefore income tax on your tax filing, which is higher than long term Capital Gains Tax of 15%?
Since you don’t pay CGT until you sell the bitcoin anyway (which is lower than income tax), is it worth all this middleman stuff?
OTOH, do they have ROTH style for this, so you pay chicken feed tax for bitcoin up front, bitcoin rises 5,000%, then spend the gigantic pile of money tax-free in disbursements?

The cost basis is what drives me coo-coo. If one has bitcoin that is years old and wish to sell, but have no records of the transactions comprising the whole, how on earth does one determine the basis. One big one for me was back during that last fork, my transaction history for many transaction just went up in a puff of smoke, transaction history for dozens of transactions just went blank, never to be seen again. So what does one do with no Ƀ amount &amp; price, not even a date to look up historical prices? I feel it’s a bunch of impossible expectations to record every move you make. Bought a pair of sock? Log it. Bought a coffee mug? Log it.
Another big frustration is which wallet you use. Some don’t give you the whole enchilada. A wallet/buying service I use, it posts the Ƀ amount, and the $ paid, but does not give the price on the purchase so you have to do little bits of math to get all the pieces needed to record. 
And so many don’t support copy and paste, I don’t know of any that will export your transaction history, not even copy &amp; paste.  And I can’t use an exchange to buy and sell that would give you a .csv, because all US exchanges are illegal in my state and have left. I’m coo-coo for Coco Puffs with it all.

That’s not iPhone 11; it’s 11 Pro.
Don’t know the validity of comparing apples to oranges. (That’s a joke, apples, get it?) One could argue that the phone is a depreciating asset if one were to trade it in to reclaim residual value, or merely an expense item (scratching my head how I’d classify it in double-entry accounting). Then compare it to BTC, a speculative venture. Since they are in different camps, I guess what is being said is, how do you want to spend you money...
As well, using a phone is realizing value as you use it. 
BTW, why is it always iPhone in these posts? Why not the Samsung Galaxy S10 lineup with the 5G weighing in at an outrageous $1,300? And Android typically depreciates faster than iPhone...
If the issue how one chooses to spend their money,  why not choose something really expensive, with great depreciation and costing bucket loads of interest like the black hole of a new car? Coincidentally I just read that cars have become so expensive and people are so strapped, that car loans are rising to 70 months. And with a loan that long, the car is depreciating faster than you are paying down the principle, so you are underwater for most of the life of the loan. Did you choose the  $25K Toyota Corolla to get to work? Or that $60K big-ass Ford F-150 with all the bells and whistles because you just had to have it?
An iPhone is minuscule compared to the ways people piss away money.

For iOS wallet, I use Co-Pay because it has 5 tiers of fees and it has a Send Max button. Otherwise I use Ledger.
At the time of this writing, [ shows the median fee at 200 sat/byte. I never go as high as median because I'm in no rush for anything.
Co-Pay reports the 5 tiers:
1. Urgent 314
2. Priority 209
3. Normal 209
4. Economy 200
5. Super Economy 180
When it's a crazy day like today, I'd not use a phone wallet, rather use Ledger for its custom fee and low-ball it at 50, but that's just me.
Or, wait for a slower day, check back in on a slower day like Sunday.
Many mention BRD wallet. I tried it. I really tried to like it, but all I did was hate it. (That and only 2 fee levels.) When the sync goes bad, it goes way bad.

Part 11: *CoinShares report: Renewable energy accounts for 77.6% of total Bitcoin’s energy usage...* And catastrophe ends with E. [
Part 12: I use crypto to top up the credits on my prepaid mobile phone. Paid for my VPN subscription with it. And I have a nice Ƀ coffee mug to start my morning. Plus, I give only bitcoin for christmas presents... Ain't nothing coming from the mall ever again.
Part 17: Your price goes to 9 decimals. The standard length is 8 for Ledger hardware wallet. I went shopping at All Things Decentral for a T shirt; the prices are quoted with 6 decimals.

OP's post reads like he wants to sell Ƀ for cash. Unless this is a brand new ability, Binanace does not do that; they are there to convert one crypto to another. You can only buy with cash via credit card, not cash out.
I'm in my Binance account now, and can find no such function.

I get that. Our hands are like hooks.

I’m missing something here. What is the motivation of someone setting out $500 worth of Ƀ for somebody to find? What kind of strange game is this?
I do remember there’s some chap in Santa Cruz who is just giving his money away, hiding money here and there on the beach. Is this some guy giving the money away high tech style?

In reality, it's a cardboard box most people throw out, or store your paper clips in. In person, it's a lovely box; I can’t bring myself to throw it out. It’s a good fairly shallow size and is great to put in your desk drawer to keep all those little things together, like flash drives, that float around in there.

It should be much faster than a week! We have one Ƀ ATM in my city and I’ve used it twice and both were between ½ hour to 1 hour to get confirmed.
Markup will be higher. As best as I can figure out, the markup is about 10% for my neighborhood machine.
The one my town shows on the 1st screen displays the Ƀ price. Compare that to Coinbase’s price to ✓ the markup.

The "gf" and the "we" really bug me.
I'm 100% don't mix love with money, not in dating, not in marriage. No way would I fall for that sly trick, "If you loved me, you'd share your 24-word seed and your PIN with me,"  or, "What? Don't you love me? Don't you trust me? If you REALLY loved me, we'd have a joint bank account," while making puppy dog eyes and sticking out their lower lip.
You have coin and a wallet; she has coin and a wallet. Learn from each other.  Support each other. Keep it separate.

That's the sentiment I learned from prison inmates with their real man talk. (Shall we say that was an interesting job.) Have a law you don't agree with? Break it because THE MAN ain't gonna tell ME what to do! Then you go to the big house, your family is destroyed, all your former friends avoid you, then you become bubba's bitch every night. Remember the beat of a butterfly's wing.

Perhaps try more upmarket cards? The two cards I carry have no currency conversion fees and have a foreign travel notifier on their websites so they know to expect transactions from those countries. American Express doesn't even have that because they pay attention to your charges. They saw I bought a ticket on Korean Air to BKK. I got an email this week saying, don't worry. We see you have a plane ticket; you don't even need to tell us that you are traveling. Relax, we got ya covered.
Charles Schwab debit is great. They reimburse you for all the foreign ATM fees! Popular with expats.

I don't get it either. I've read eye-rolling cheapskate posts about the "high cost" of hardware wallets. $60 for a Ledger and they will whine at  great volume and great length about how expensive it is. They can't get perspective that this is less than a single dinner for two out on the town.
One buddy is such a cheapskate I had to finally buy him a Ledger as a gift to protect his assets... and then it took him 6 months to get around to setting it up. Yep, Coinbase customer sitting there with his coin on the exchange.

I had to think for a bit to remember when I last used cash. Then it came to me. A week ago, $3 to a parking garage cashier after a cocktail party downtown.

Robinhood is not geared for people who want to hold their own bitcoin; you can't withdraw it from the account. You can only send it back to cash.

"Bitcoin transaction requires electricity. Which is even more inconvenient."
It's hard for me to think of a transaction of any sort that doesn't have some sort of energy expenditure.
Maybe you paid cash to put gas in your car. Electricity is needed to power to pump to get the fuel from the underground tank into yours. You go to the cashier in the booth to pay, but he has lights and air conditioning, a cash register and maybe a cooler to buy a refreshing drink.
To get that cash, the ATM uses electricity to operate and the bank branch administering the ATM is using electricity.
And electricity was used by the presses that printed the money, and the machines that cut the money and the lights and AC for the printing press workers, and... and... and... They might even have a fridge to keep their refreshing break-time drinks cool!
The cash infrastructure is a very large and very hungry Energy Monster.

That’s because, when you pay your $65 to buy the Ledger, they like you so much, they preloaded it with Ƀ1.5
