Somewhere between 8K and 75K.
I saw a big 1 little 2 in the charts.
@_date: 2019-07-04 13:11:37
Read into it.
Plenty of negatives.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:13:09
With Robinhood you don’t control the coins.
@_date: 2019-07-04 00:26:02
XRP is a shitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-05 14:36:04
If you are being frugal this isn’t great advice.
Let’s say you dca $100 weekly and the fee is 3-5%.
You are losing money from the start, to the tune of $156-260. Which isn’t a lot, but I wouldn’t throw away that amount of money for minimal work.
You also lose future growth on the money, which also might be minimal, but is still money.
If you schedule it correctly you will always have cash on the exchange and don’t have to be impatient and lose money.

Time to climb back over 10000.
Will this be the last sub 10K, prior to the Oct 16K foretold?
@_date: 2019-03-21 02:03:46
Wolf in sheep's clothing.

It's not, Jack just gets his balls washed around here.
@_date: 2019-11-09 01:29:38
Ballsack eyes probably going to try and short BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-18 16:45:21
This guy plans to unveil Tabula Rasa, his clean slate version of Bitcoin?
Sounds like they are using this as a promotion for some alternate shitcoin.
Maybe it is Nakamoto, but I would be highly skeptical.
@_date: 2019-08-28 22:45:50
If a recession comes to realization, people may cash out of BTC to access cash.
It can be a haven in a turbulent market, but if you need the money I’m guessing hodl goes out the window.
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:47:51
Seems like a lot of complaining for a minor dip.
Obviously I don’t know what the price will be and if it will continue to slip, but we’ve been wavering between 13K and 9K for some time now.
If you are fine with risk and taxes, can buy the low and sell the high. We have perfect brackets in between 9/10K - 13K. Continue to build up BTC slowly.
Otherwise, hodl and stfu ��������‍♂️
@_date: 2019-08-21 14:35:52
It’s been fluctuating between 9K and 12K for awhile now.
10.1K seems like a decent price given how it’s been moving lately.
Really as long as you aren’t planning to sell right away, the price doesn’t mean much.
If you are afraid of losing your money pick a price that you are comfortable with selling and execute accordingly.
Otherwise hold!

There is not a complete picture of Bernie’s finances.
We do know that he made millions off of books deal. Has three houses and has a facade of salt of the earth.
He wants you to pay more taxes so people can get free shit that really isn’t free.
As far as my own wealth and being taxed, I can only laugh at your projections.
You’ll never know how much I’ve have in any form so your weak attempt at trying to wealth shame me, is good for a laugh!
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:09:27
Well if you truly believe that, there is no reason for you to waste your time here.
No reason to have skin in the game, so pull your money out while you can.
I won’t try to convince you otherwise.
No one can predict long term what will happen with BTC, so it’s a fools errand essentially.
I believe in the tech and the growing ecosystem. If you don’t then okay, but save us the melodrama.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:31:39
One thing to claim ownership and another to harvest.
If you can’t get to the rock, and bring it home you don’t own it!
@_date: 2019-06-18 01:39:58
Great explanation. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-22 20:28:36
I tend to think that Litecoin is at the forefront.
It’s been the test to Bitcoin’s prod.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:52:26
You could probably pull this off with Random X.
Even then it still might take some time to recoup the cost of your Pi and the solar panel.
You could then convert whatever earnings to bitcoin, but would eat some in fees.

Most retirees aren’t trying to rummage in your pockets to redistribute it for ‘free’ programs.
I don’t read Breitbart, but I do know Bernie is a cuck by fact alone! His wife is a fraud too!
@_date: 2019-06-21 22:37:45
Those are temporary though, at least for the most part.
Watch the depth chart and they set them at a price and when it gets close they pull them and push it to a higher sell price.
@_date: 2019-06-30 15:56:31
Different algo, which if anything god forbid happens to SHA, is somewhat of a risk mitigation.
Speed and good miner backing.
It doesn’t solve anything unique but is different enough to provide value.
@_date: 2019-06-22 13:17:54
Nobody was arguing that the rally would go on forever.
It was in relation to the 'walls'. They move rapidly and often.
A pullback maybe eminent. Who really knows though? I've seen plenty of predictions up and down bite the dust in this sub.

The more adoption you have around BTC the better.
The blockchain is at the core of it at, but if you can get more solutions surrounding that, the better!
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:59:01
It’s unique enough to stand on it’s own.
Plus it typically is the faster guinea pig, which is pretty invaluable.
Not even close in terms of a scam coin like xrp.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:32:00
Of course he’s not against millionaires, he is one ��
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:36:55
Doesn’t hurt to diversify.
Monero and Litecoin are not shitcoins.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:02:39
Nothing. Up and down and round and round. Bitcoin rolls on.
@_date: 2019-06-25 03:21:16
You have the illusion of BTC and ETH.
Your cash is essentially tethered to the price of both, but you don’t have the keys.
Which if don’t plan to pull of off RH, that’s perfectly fine.
It’s a cash in, cash out.
@_date: 2019-06-29 01:06:31
It was more of a comment on ownership rather than the ability to do it.
At some point human progress will get us there. Until then ownership is nothing more than wishful thinking. You don't own it if you can't get to it.

The walls are always fluid.
You have to watch the depth chart and the book.
None of it is static.
@_date: 2019-06-23 01:30:27
Please listen to this guy.
Your financial future is much brighter with minimal debt.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:01:19
If you have any significant amount that you don’t want to lose, move it to cold storage such as Ledger or Trezor.
Ledger is pretty simple to use.
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:58:57
It will never be as private as Monero, but that’s okay.
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:55:21
Then we should feel sorry for him.
He a facade socialist.
Socialism for you, but capitalism for him.
If he was a man of real principle he should pay beyond what is required of taxes and not hoard the wealth.
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:04:14
Those walls tend to be fluid.

Shit, I've been reading Oolong all this time.

The last time I heard my dog fart it was over 15K.
@_date: 2019-06-22 16:16:52
Xrp is shit.
If you want to buy an altcoin, look at Monero or Litecoin.
They are unique in their own ways and have good communities around them.
It doesn’t hurt to diversify, but there is a lot of trash/scams out there.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:42:55
You are thinking in the wrong mindset.
Jack or Twitter doesn’t give validation to Bitcoin.
It can stand on its own, and Twitter is shit anyways. Bitcoin is better off without his support long term.
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:17:17
Good, he’s a turd.
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:50:54
Can you tell us what the price will be in your future world?
@_date: 2019-01-19 17:22:41
This has been in the works for awhile. Would be good to see it passed.
@_date: 2018-11-01 01:27:58
Bitcoin will outlive Twitter.
@_date: 2019-09-12 01:04:21
Actually he’s kinda of an idiot.
Negotiated his own contract with the Broncos and actually cut a worse deal for himself considering his position and what they make.
He then went to the Chargers who explained to him general supply and demand. He was then able to realize that he could make significantly more money and have it actually guaranteed.
Smart to try and get in on BTC, but not the best business acumen otherwise.
@_date: 2019-09-15 12:29:38
But what does Ja Rule think about BTC?
@_date: 2019-05-30 02:50:24
Yes. You can set a target, say buy 1 btc at 8500 and wait.
@_date: 2019-05-05 20:09:50
The old, I noticed you [insert excuse here] excuse.
Maybe next time have some real ideas.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:59:20
Fuck that.
Bitcoin is inevitable without Dorsey or his shit platform.
Twitter will be long dead while Bitcoin will live on.
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:56:52
Sounds like your out of luck.
Bake your own cake, problem solved.
Forcing people to do things isn’t freedom and your right to be offended doesn’t trump someone else’s right to refuse to bake you a cake on religious grounds.
That world doesn’t suck.
Nice jab though, you may have offended me ����
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:06:55
Sounds more like your ideas don't stand on their own and you are afraid of having your worldview challenged.
Slink away hiding behind excuses, thinking that you are better than everyone else.
Fine with me.
Read back through the comment string and ask yourself who was the first one to dip into the ad homs? Wasn't the MAGA guy...

If you want cold storage or more secure storage the ledger is necessary.
2fa is largely to protect your coinbase account.
@_date: 2019-05-05 02:51:14
This is stupid logic.
Go to a different baker, stop trying to save the goddamn world.
@_date: 2019-05-05 15:47:34
Guess what, we don't live in that world.
Furthermore, crying about it depends on the circumstance.
In the cake baker scenario, there is nothing to cry about. I wouldn't expect him to ask me to do something outside of my moral boundaries. Same would apply if a muslim refused to bake the same cake.
The key idea is that you are not entitled, even if you believe you are, to anyone's services. We have basic protections in place for discrimination, and they work well. Outside of that, if you want something done, you'll have to do it yourself if someone else refuses to do it based on their morality.
