Hey thanks for the good suggestions. We will definitely take your voice into consideration.
As for the password, we are going to abolish the need for it entirely in the next coming update. You only need to secure your passphrase and that should be the only thing for the user.

The API will be for both browsers and mobile although I cannot really promise which comes first and/or other details right now. But we will def keep you updated when the API become a bit more polished for testing.

Hey thanks, your recommendation means a lot for us.
IndieSquare Wallet is still far from perfect but we are making it better day by day and moving really fast.
Especially, when the dex on IndieSquare wallet becomes even more intuitive and user-friendly and if interesting projects like SoG keeps creating demand for trading of tokens, I think we are going to see a lot more interesting interactions between tokens from different projects using Counterparty. Cannot wait to see that myself.

Hi, Koji from IndieSquare here. Actually this is my first time posting on reddit...
Yes, we would really appreciate ShapeShift's recommendation. Right now, we are trying to keep the app simple as much as simple and intend to limit the tokens you can trade using ShpeShift API but later on, more extensive integration of ShapeShift API is definitely a possibility!

You will be able to integrate basic features of counterwallet using our easy to use API. You might want to build a mobile wallet for your own specialized token or some might want to use it to build an mobile app for gift cards for stores merchants. Literally, so much new stuff will be possible with some creativity.
Also, if you are a game developer, we are building an SDK for game developers so that building a game like Spells of Genesis will be simple and easy and potentially creating a whole new platform of Counterparty-based games with game items traded freely by users.
