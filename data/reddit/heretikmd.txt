the actual bitcoin.de market prices as determined by its users has rarely reflected gox the last few months, so i wouldn't worry about this matter too much (except on principle, maybe)
@_date: 2014-06-13 06:53:04
but there are a lot of great pools out there! slush's pool is great! i've been using bitminter for almost a year and it's awesome! of course variance can be a bitch, but the output is the same in the end. if bitcoin fails because the community is too greedy, lazy and short-sighted to change a single line of configuration on their miners, then this community and cryptocurrencies are simply lost beyond redemption.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:26:19
maybe because finally enough people complained about the disparity? the last few days the price on btcde followed bitstamp, being EUR 10-20,- higher at times, but never lower than stamp. btcde wasn't more influenced by gox than any of the other exchanges. it's not like btcde users don't track other exchanges as well. good riddance nonetheless, it's time for a new generation of exchanges.

I always saw failed/failing Bitcoin startups (Gox, Neo.Bee, BFL, 99% of Cryptostocks) as the equivalent to the dot-com bubble of the late 90s. Some companies managed to build solid business models on this new internet thingie (e.g. Google, Amazon, Ebay - all children of the 90's), some companies failed due to misconceptions of what would work with this new technology and what wouldn't. I think we might see the very same thing happening on top of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:56:56
you are assuming that other pools are less profitable.
eg. eligius also has a 0% fee. other pools charge 1-2% mining fee tops, which is still next to nothing compared to the power cost of running a miner.
Example: 550GH / 600W at current difficulty =&gt; BTC 0.716 / month. Cost: 1% mining fee =&gt; BTC 0.0071; Power @ 0.15 USD/kWh =&gt; USD 64.80 = BTC 0.108 (@ 600 USD / BTC)
mining at ghash.io right now is like shitting in the swimming pool because getting out first would burn too many calories. with so many economically equally good alternatives around there's simply no rationale behind it.
also, GH trading on cex.io is nothing more than hoping to find the next sucker for your overpriced hashrate once you're done with it. i wasn't aware how bad people are at math until cex.io came online.

what if asking people to be 'good' is part of the protocol, because everyone with skin in the game has the incentive to protect the network?
@_date: 2014-06-13 13:58:06
i'm not hoping anything. i'm just saying two things: 
1. people trying to drive miners away from ghash.io can be seen as a manifestation of an implicit proof of stake model inherent to bitcoin. 
2. how some miners can be too lazy to point their miners to a different pool is beyond me. it's literally done in seconds.
either way, the way i see it a serious 51% attack will cause the price to plummet, will have most short-term profit seekers leave the community, will have bitcoin and its infrastructure be able to slowly recover again - unless something better comes along, of course. a 51% attack will be a signifcant setback, but not the end of bitcoin.

Great to see the Trezor shipping! :) 
One question though, what do you think about the recent Bad USB attack proof of concept? Do you feel like a firmware based attack on Trezor might become feasible in the future or do you think that you have limited the attack surface tight enough? Are there any additional protective measures in place to ensure that the Trezor can only be updated with legit firmware (ie. certified / signed by Trezor)?
Keep up the good work, I now have another piece of hardware to add to my wishlist ;)

Personal reasons: I prefer cash to cards. I dislike paypal but don't feel like throwing my credit card data all around various web shops either. i'm kinda pissed at the banking system and have been looking for alternatives.
Use cases where Bitcoin came in real handy: Sending money to a friend. Exchanging money for goods and services with private individuals globally (no, not silk road you dummy). In other words - remember how the internet enabled us to talk and collaborate with other individuals all over the globe? Now you can just as easily do business with them, buy them a beer, etc.
Use cases where Bitcoin would have come real handy, if the exchange infrastructure where more distributed: Large international money orders, because holy shit look at those fees.
I would really love to see more crypto-currency acceptance and stability because the legacy banking / credit card system just feels sluggish and bloated in comparison. In my opinion of course.
Regarding your concrete questions:
1. Currently only fringe cases such as p2p business. For traditional eCommerce it probably makes little sense at the moment, other than giving it a try. Additional cost is neglible if you overcome the initial learning curve.
2. In case of widespread adoption: Store of value, instant transaction times, global p2p business, no need to exchange in local currencies.
3. Fraud protection can be implemented using a multisig escrow system. Not sure about what cash back, price matching and other perks entail as I'm not familiar with American CC offers, but I'm pretty sure that either you or the merchant pay for it in the end, which means, well, you pay for it in the end.

From what I understand the attack can go in both directions, as in a compromised host loading malevolent firmware onto a susceptible usb device (which then in turn attacks subsequent hosts).
Either way, good to see that Trezor is protecting itself against unsigned firmware, thus preventing these kinds of attack. Thanks for the fast reply!

is using the mtgox dollar price as reference outdated? yes. would a different reference frame be more suitable? yes. does it affect the prices on bitcoin.de? no. it's sub-optimal in that it can cause confusion, but if you look at the actual EUR prices the influence is next to none. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:01:57
There's no need for a pure bitcoin economy for bitcoin to succeed, it can exist alongside other fiat and crypto currencies and still prosper. In a way I feel like that is part of the point of creating (or rather enabling the creation of) alternative currencies.

Personal opinion: While I'm all for supporting Snowden I wouldn't focus on that executive order. It feels like at best and like yet another "illegal" way to use Bitcoin at worst. (Please be aware that I state this as someone who hasn't fully followed the discussion and lives outside of the US, I might be underestimating the situation)
Remember when Wikileaks got blocked by PayPal and most western credit card companies? *That* was fucked up. It affected non-US citizens as well and had tangible impact. No need for an official executive order. 
The situation is not about being able to ignore local, "inconvenient" laws. It's about independence from centralized entities like Visa or PayPal that may or may not be bullied into compliance by private or governmental forces. And I don't think that a term like "Obama Effect" does this justice.
Apart from that, hey! Sounds like fun!
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:46:48
PRish images for Bitcoin in general might turn out too generic and open in my opinion.
To clarify, I think Snowden himself (and the donation campaign) is a great prompt! I just wouldn't focus too much on *current* political developments (ie. the executive order) as the implications are still unclear. The last year offered more impacting revelations in these regards.
Either way, although I'm not sure whether I'll be able to participate again I'm definitely keeping an eye on what will come of this contest :)

Assuming Coinfinity charges the same fees at the Bitcoin ATMs like for their bitcoinbons, it's somewhere between 7% - 9% (  ) It looks like they increased their premium though, I'm fairly certain it used to be around 5%

At a market cap of 200 billion they're at about 1/20th of their gross dollar volume, which ain't half bad either. This would still leave us with a hypothetical USD 1,720 Bitcoin in that case. But yes, infering the bitcoin market cap 1:1 from the yearly transaction volume is a rather shaky argument. Me, I just want to get rid of PayPal. Fucking PayPal.

To clarify the bit about "trying to obscure the fact of that they [Mastercoins] where issued by a single entity": I'm not talking about JR's role in writing the white paper, creating the Exodus address, etc - I'm focusing on the following bit: "No one controlled the amount created, who created them or set any limit on their creation". To me, this sounds like you're trying to sell the Mastercoin distribution as a decentralized, neutral minting process. Maybe this was intentional, maybe it wasn't. I just wanted to point this out to avoid misconceptions by people that haven't been following the initial stages of Mastercoin.
I'm not saying a "single entity" being the spark is bad. I'm saying a single entity issuing all the currency is. And that's what happened with Mastercoin, no matter how you spin it.
I think the main issue I have with Mastercoin is the following:
Satoshi gave the world a protocol that is (hopefully) going to run for the next couple of decades, slowly gaining momentum and people step by step taking part. Initially the idea was to make it possible for *everyone* with a regular CPU to take part in this decentralized network and distribute wealth (in terms of Bitcoins) as evenly as possible. Then GPUs, FPGAs and ASICs came, but that's a different story.
Mastercoin was a 1-2 months sales pitch. Which means we have a huge disparity in wealth distribution (in terms of Mastercoins). I'm not sure if literally all the riches in the world (in terms of Mastercoins) being in a handful of people is a good way to start a financial revolution. Also although JR will not be in direct control of the network, he will still own huge percentage of all Mastercoins in circulation which gives him more than enough power over the system. Please correct me if I'm wrong, maybe he made a huge giveaway lately, but from what I remember he's having a huge stake in this project (which I respect, of course) and as a result has a significant amount of Mastercoins. Imagine Satoshi having all 21 millions Bitcoins minted within 2 months time, with him owning a fifth of it and then trying to sell it for USD. That would feel kinda weird, wouldn't it.

@_date: 2013-10-26 07:02:51
Please note that I have full respect for JR stepping up with this project. Just as I have respect for the guys working on Colored Coins, Bitshares and the team improving Bitcoin itself.
1. The process of distributing Mastercoin was as neutral and decentralized as a Central Bank issuing money. The process being "widely known" doesn't make it any more neutral or decentralized.
2. "A committee, collective, co-op or company" would still be a single entity. See Ripple. Alternatives are mining (see Bitshares) and a neutral approach of everybody being able to issue an Asset with the market finding the price (see Colored Coins).
3. Of course the distribution of Mastercoin didn't *need* a different approach. From a *technical* perspective. But from a social perspective, for a tool aiming to do for financial markets what the Internet did for Information, Mastercoin is doing nothing but trying to make money for the early adopters (ie people participating in the Exodus).
4. Ownership level: Of course everyone could have put up the same level of funding as JR. Then again everyone can send themselves money. Mastercoin distribution was more of an IPO selling shares of a company, than anything else.
5. How will the power law curve apply to Mastercoin just as it does in Bitcoin? All the coins have already been distributed. Now it's just Mastercoin holders selling their coins to the rest of the community.
6. Giving away 3.9 BTC worth of Mastercoin (based on the IPO price) in a thread of Bitcointalk is not really tackling the problem of uneven wealth distribution. It's more a way of marketing and pulling more people in than anything else.
Like I said, I find both the concept and the way it's being done interesting. But I have some problems with the way you try to sell it and with the way the issuing of currency has been implemented.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:54:56
Of course no one was "holding" or "premining" Mastercoin because they were generated on the spot by a single entity (ie. a script being run by dacoinminster). People got Mastercoin by sending Bitcoin to a wallet controlled by a single person, so Mastercoins were as a matter of fact *sold*. It doesn't matter whether it was an automated process or not.
I'm really looking forward to see how Mastercoin is going to develop in the future and the way the issue is approached both theoretically (ie the whitepaper) and practically (ie btc bounties funded by the exodus adress) is very interesting to see, but trying to spin it in a way that makes it look like the Mastercoins weren't sold and trying to obscure the fact that they were issued by a single entity leaves a sour taste in my mouth.
@_date: 2013-09-19 10:31:28
"At the end of the day, a lot of money is taken/given, and nothing of value was actually provided."
What will be provided is a global, decentralized, secure computer network that takes care of money transactions in a more transparent, less outdated and more stable way than banks or governments will ever do. And that's the beauty of it. Bitcoin is giving birth to itself, by transforming Fiat to Hardware to an currency independent of government control. (independent of government control in the meaning of: whichever country has the predominant currency [ie. USD, EUR] is the one with the largest financial influence)

as far as i know none of the major markets accept visa or paypal (too much of a risk that people just cancel the credit card payment as soon as the bitcoins arrive). for the european market i've come across bitcoin-24.com, which accept wire transfers via SEPA and other means. takes 2-3 days however. lately they've been experiencing occasional downtimes, but so far they seem legit.
@_date: 2013-06-10 08:32:48
That's why I love Bitcoin.de, it's awesome for Intra-European trading. If I recall collectly I only had to verify my bank account (they send you a small deposit, sort of like Paypal does with Credit Cards). After that you sell and buy from the members directly, using Bitcoin.de as Escrow. All you have to do are regular SEPA transactions which cost next to nothing as long as you're trading with EUR. It's a lot slower that way (you have to wait 1-2 days for the transaction to come through) but this makes the market more stable against short term volatility, you only pay for what you buy (there's a 1% trading fee that gets split up) and there's no central Bitcoin.de bank account that could get closed &lt;3
