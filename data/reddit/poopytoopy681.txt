Yes the new cards have more numbers than an interac card so they cant be accepted

My bank recently switched me to a visa debit interac card, which is not supported.

This looks like some sort of support for Intel Hardware has been implemented. Perhaps CPU mining will make a comeback.

It hit 1125USD ~ 6950 CNY on BTC China before it crashed.

Seems pretty easy, all we have to do is create a "public fund" for DPR's defence so all of us btc folk can help support the cause. DPR sends some coins through a mixer and donates to this fund.

If this is true, Bitcoin has really gained some new legs.

Even still, anything to keep the 600k worth of btc out of the largest group of international terrorists is good in my books.

Should accept it in their android marketplace Google play

That would be a glorious moment for DPR after all the sloppy mistakes he made in the past. Let's wait and see how this plays out.

I am so excited to try this when it launches, keep up the good work because Canada is lacking with BTC buy options.

As a former GPU miner, this intrigues me.

I mine....

Well if there is another copy of the wallet file floating around as a fail-safe, it would be quite easy to spend these coins if you knew the encrypted pass-phrase. Perhaps, DPR is just putting on a media circus and waiting for the right time to get this wallet moved.

I was just thinking about this myself. Maybe big pharmacy and science could take some of their R&amp;d dollars and offer some incentive to run calculations of a network similar to the bitcoin network

Thanks for the response! I just wanted to point out that the new visa debit cards don't work. But I have used your service in the past and it worked flawlessly, now we just need to work on that 0.4btc limit :)

This could very well be an option, although if true, once in a safe location DPR should be calling out the FBI's bluff. However, I fear they may have gotten the real guy.

This is the reason for "Satoshi Nakamoto".
