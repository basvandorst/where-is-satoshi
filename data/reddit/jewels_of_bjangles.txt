But what will happen when "it" happens

For me the whole allure of bitcoin was that it was totally free market

This in theory could hapen again and again though out the future

While thats entirely possibe BU is a responce to a legitimate problem with bitcoin functionaly. I dont know enough about it so i have to trust your opinion. But Is BU really not fiesable. Why is it a paper plane? Where will it fail?

Do you hold any other altcoin 
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:38:22
But it seems like if BTC could be fixed internally there would be no need for BU. It seems to me this is a forced hand that has to be played. In sure im wrong though

I also think the etf will pass . What makes your prediction  3000.. im genuinely interested
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:38:37
I appreciate your view . You have swayed me 
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:26:06
Thanks for the reply . But i was more asking about the specifics about the properties and how it will operate 
@_date: 2017-03-27 04:57:57
I mean free market after the parameters have been set . The whole allure for bitcoin was unlike fiat currencies they cant manipulate it. Its free of the hand of man. I was way off it appears

Wow i never knew bitcoin was this vunravle that people can just decide to go another way with it 
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:48:35
