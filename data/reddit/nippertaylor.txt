Fully agree - our CEO at FintekNews has been writing this for over a year.  It will be awesome when the CME/Royal Mint Gold's RMG gold-backed digital currency launches.  We are VERY excited about that product here.

That's a smart strategy
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:47:49
Fair question - not a clue.  A lot.

I think there are some ginormous operations - like Bitmain - that have halls of mining equipment and these are some of the whales that Wall Street won't be able to touch, b/c they own the infrastructure and coins they've mined to date.

This is interesting b/c the CBOE was originally launching in 2018, then the CME came out and said they'd launch this year (the 18th) in front of the CBOE, so now the CBOE speeded up their launch.

Yes, the gold will be held in the UK Royal Mint Gold vault - all tracked on the blockchain - with an RMG coin representing 1 gram of physical spot gold.  AMAZING product.

Very smart on your part.

Yeah, he really has a distinctive look.  A lot of the fund managers my husband used to work with in Chicago were pretty eclectic.  Good question on the target - so many predictions out there.  Just pick a number.

Not approved yet in the US, unbelievably

Thanks - Bill Taylor from FintekNews wrote this piece and he has a fun sense of humor, love his writing style!
@_date: 2018-06-29 11:37:33
This guy may be a "brilliant" economist but he is so freakin' out of touch on bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:29:11
Thanks for all the input.  We will post this more regularly in this forum - we've been publishing this Mon-Fri for over a year on FintekNews, and started when gold was well ahead of bitcoin. :)    
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:56:46
OMG - I know.  We have been waiting since before Christmas to get verified on Bitgold and we know the owners.  Finally have given up.  That's where the whole crypto universe is going to have to get there act together on servicing.  
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:22:41
Hi - it is open to the public now as of Tuesday, 3/13 - you can download it from the Apple I-Tunes App store or Google Play store.
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:20:36
Hi There - sorry for not responding back earlier.  As of this morning, I got an eblast saying it is now available to the general public, so you might try again.  This is the email I got this morning (Tuesday, 3/13)
Hi Cindy,
Thank you for your patience and interest in helping us test Circle Invest!
You no longer have to mess with TestFlight because...

Hi - as of Tuesday, 3/13 it is now available on the I-Tunes App store or the Google Play store.  Good luck with it! 
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:34:50
All the transactions costs are free - at least in the beta.  I am quite sure they are making money on the spread on the fill - they have to make money somehow, but I just like the app, bottom line.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:25:55
Yes, to both.  Down today to $9800 on the SEC talk to regulate the exchanges, which we view as VERY positive.  Thanks for your comments!
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:34:33
Our team at FintekNews is THRILLED to see the SEC take more intelligent action on regulating security tokens.  A long time in coming.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:39:26
Sorry - nope, you are SOOOOO wrong wrong wrong, my friend.  No compensation whatsoever, I just know someone on their institutional desk and got an email invite to the beta.  Didn't even know it (the app or the invite) was coming but am underwhelmed by Coinbase.  Though I think they are brilliant.  But really impressed with this app.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:35:34
No - just transfers to and from your linked bank account.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:35:35
I guess we'll see.  
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:25:19
Ignore my other post to you - I don't check daily.  Glad it got resolved for you and as of today, it is now available to the public anyway (3/13).  
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:25:54
 INTERESTING!  Reverse window dressing - not like that's never been done in the markets before!
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:03:27
No - that's the thing.  It fills instantaneously.  I could not believe it.  When I've bought and sold on Coinbase, it does take hours.   I imagine when the Robinhood app comes out, it will be pretty impressive as well.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:32:29
I am the original poster.  I am just trying out a beta app, no compensation, no shill.  Circle actually has institutional bitcoin trading, very little known about it, but they are very credible in the space.  I like it so far.  It just is easy to use.  I am sure many of you are far more sophisticated than me in the whole bitcoin buying/trading space.  I just really like it.  Sticking to my word.  A far as some of the questions, I don't have an external wallet linked - just a bank account.  
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:27:04
Yes, the wild swings are great, but efficiency will ultimately price in more consistency with more regulation and more widespread usage of the derivatives out there.  Thanks for your comment!
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:37:00
Yeah, I emailed them about something, too and no response yet.  I haven't experienced any problems, but I've gotten two updates since downloading the beta with bug fixes.  So far it's by invite only.  I know someone there on the institutional desk, so I think they just had internal employees share emails of people they knew and invited them to the beta test.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:34:54
LOL - wish we were that powerful!!
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:24:50
He didn't say it personally - it came from their research department - but it is pretty amusing given his prior statements and his proclamation that he would fire anybody stupid enough to trade cryptos from his trading team just a few months before. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:01:54
What is a stickied comment?  I don't know all the ins  and outs of Reddit yet but BashCo said it sounds like a scam, and it is not.  I am not getting compensated - just on the beta list (wasn't even expecting an invite - just on their email list from another connection at Circle) - decided to download it (which I never do) and I am really impressed with the ease and speed and thought I would share.  That's all.  No scam, my friend - you are wrong wrong wrong.  
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:55:13
Interesting - I didn't know that.  I think they are transacting in the billions now as well inc ryptos, but only on the institutional side.  I imagine there were too many potential legal liabilities on the retail side for them early on - just a guess though.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:21:29
There's probably 1000+ articles out there predicting a future price of bitcoin.  This one is pretty interesting given that it is predicting this increase yet within 2018.  I think they're smoking weed, personally to predict this within 9 more months.    
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:18:54
More to come no doubt.  I saw a billboard in ATL announcing over 100 bitcoin ATMs.  I forget who the vendor was - probably Coinsource, but the part that was amazing to me is that bitcoin promotion has now made it to billboards.  Thought that was interesting.
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:20:08
Ditto here!
