As bullish as I am on crypto I think we are getting ahead of ourselves, surely we need mass adoption first

Someone offer him a good deal on blockchaincoin, we need an ICO 
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:25:00
Am afraid I agree, will drop back down, we are not out of the woods yet, watch out for the bears!!
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:57:22
Definitely the correct attitude, hopefully they all share the same opinion
@_date: 2018-09-08 10:15:47
I know that works but only been involved in crypto since February, I must need to stare harder for longer, am sure it’s all about practice :)

Is this also the flat earth guy?
@_date: 2018-09-25 16:15:13
I will store my own coins, however many out there will never do that, so they can invest vía Bakkt, Bakkt will have insurance in case it is ever hacked, so nothing to worry about folks
@_date: 2018-09-16 20:05:15
You can’t buy tether with fiat, you have to buy btc with whatever fiat currency your country uses, then you can swap the btc for tusd, Gemini exchange is launching or has launched, not sure, their own stable coin, I believe you can purchase that with fiat currency directly
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:49:17
I can see me not getting my next 0,1 btc purchase under 7k as I hoped
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:15:40
Haha, I know the feeling, I bought a bit yesterday causing the second drop

@_date: 2018-09-22 16:11:30
I was referring to faketoshi, no one has the right to remove someone else’s coins, what gives you the right to decide?
@_date: 2018-09-12 06:53:56
Lol, was just thinking that, to scared to check the balance!!
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:28:00
Lol, sounds about right, what a shitpost

The deadline to decide if to approve, reject or postpone, they will pospone a few days before the deadline, so next decisión in to approve, reject or postpone will be 90 days after that

Or get the jokes in while they still can, it won’t be around for long

Have a read of these articles:
Information about Bakkt and institutional investments
Some information about bitcoin custodial services for hedge funds and investors:

@_date: 2018-09-06 20:15:29
Haha, I know the feeling, I bought a bit yesterday causing the second drop
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:34:53
It’s irrelevant, why should anyone have the power to remove someone else’s coins?
@_date: 2018-09-25 20:17:45
Lol, no that was his father
@_date: 2018-09-11 20:19:13
Well of course printing money resolves the problems created by printing money, then the real problem is the next presidents headache
@_date: 2018-09-04 18:31:27
Haha excellent
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:47:13
Something like that haha, I think we need more main stream exposure and regulation before investors will use it to counteract inflation, bakkt, ETF’s, countries adopting g20 regulations as of next month etc. I see the dinosaurs in the US government as a major hurdle, ironically they are the ones that have caused the need for crypto in the first place
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:58:22
Am good either way, I believe we will see a pump soon, if it drops I will be buying the dips regardless
@_date: 2018-09-17 14:45:38
Didn’t Mt Gox go under in 2014 when btc price was 500$? If you bought btc at 500$ and just got them back this year, would you not sell some?

Haha, I forgot he was in full billionaire mode still

Well done, be patient, it will not happen overnight
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:35:00
I fully agree, was being sarcastic, I am not a fan of Bcash or roger ver 
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:10:32
In spain I buy via bank transfer to coinbase and then send to binance and trade to other coins
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:04:22
No they are not
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:06:51
Haha, beat me to it 
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:47:56
But they are so cheap now lol
@_date: 2018-08-30 16:01:48
Lol, I will buy if it drops below 6k or goes above 7,5k, bear markets and dips are a great thing if you accumulate and hodl, just stop looking at your portfolio balance and think of the next ath, don’t buy more than you can afford and don’t get so stressed by someone else’s comments, life is too short
@_date: 2018-08-03 19:18:27
Same as he thought about Apple, google and Facebook!
@_date: 2018-08-19 16:34:10
Yes, Mt.Gox, the exchange that traded 70% of all btc got hacked in 2014 causing the long bear market, if Binance, Bitfinex, Houbi, Kraken, Hitbtc, Coinbase, yobit and Biteex all got hacked in 2018 then you could compare to 2014, aside from the above, the G20 are passing recommendations for global regulations, the SEC is looking into ETF’s, EU has passed regulations, etc none of this happened in 2014
@_date: 2018-08-22 14:56:35
I think the main complaint about coinbase is their charges, you can reduce them by sending a  bank transfer instead of paying with a card, when you convert though you will see the btc buy price is slightly more than the actual market price that they state also
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:31:09
It’s coming and hedge funds will use gs services for custody
@_date: 2018-08-06 16:45:59
They just don’t want us to get excited about it and buy more bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:40:32
ETF’s are for hedge funds 
@_date: 2018-08-19 13:04:42
How can you compare the crypto market in 2018 to the 2014 market? It is a different world.
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:02:42
Haha beat me to it 
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:48:16
Why would anyone sell now, it is time to buy not sell
@_date: 2018-08-06 05:39:59
But it is if we can walk into Starbucks with nothing but btc and walk out with coffee, I don’t think anyone expected to see a price of coffee in btc due to the price variations, the staff would spend more time adjusting the price board than serving customers
@_date: 2018-05-13 18:09:54
1000 in Spain too
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:22:17
5800 would be awesome, my finger is on the buy button
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:42:10
I get paid end of this week, please drop a bit further btc please
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:20:40
Why? Market has recently dropped close to 50 billion
@_date: 2018-08-17 15:45:20
This is in no way aplicable to me as I don’t have Netflix!!
@_date: 2018-08-09 10:18:41
More likely they are filling their bags will they see weak hands folding
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:24:26
Hedge funds will use this not us who hodl 
@_date: 2018-08-04 22:39:30
Main Street adoption as it will lead to lambos eventually, to be honest I wouldn’t  buy one, I would clear my mortgage and that will make me feel like a billionaire, I am not that greedy
@_date: 2018-08-22 18:42:38
I agree with all your points except the last section, the delays mean nothing as all other ETF’s have been delayed and then rejected
@_date: 2018-08-14 11:42:33
@_date: 2018-08-04 20:44:19
Have not heard of DED or RIP, did they have an ICO? Lol
PS comments like that will never make us hodlers sell
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:03:35
Ask me tomorrow and I will confirm for sure, before asking, please read my response again 
@_date: 2018-08-20 07:26:28
That’s amazing, am sure once the g20 issue regulations in October things will change, I think we will see a lot of changes in this space the next few months
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:06:53
You can buy small amounts of any coins via coinbase app once you have opened and account and confirmed your id, you can pay with a card, there would probably be a 1$ fee for the transaction, you can also send via bank transfer to them to avoid the card fee.
Once purchased via coinbase you then have the btc, you can use a qr code or address to move the funds to a wallet or exchange if you wanted to swap for other coins 
I have never tried to send funds to buy something via coinbase, however I suppose it will be possible via qr code, can’t see why not, any problems just send to a wallet and purchase from that wallet instead
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:08:53
Yes, once that has happened they are also going to turn the internet off, the post offices around the world are going to declare this email thing is just a scam
@_date: 2018-08-06 14:05:18
We will not use them but hedge funds will
@_date: 2018-08-05 06:16:55
I think the first response is the 16th, they could approve, reject or pospone decision 30 days, after the 30 days they could pospone a further 60 days, then 90 days, taking final response period to February 
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:58:20
Agreed, I think the ETF might be delayed and prices will drop mid August, it’s a win win though, if approved our portfolios increase in value, if delayed and prices drop and we buy the dip
@_date: 2018-08-03 17:23:50
I couldn’t finish it either, will also stop looking at CNET for reviews from now on, what a moron 
@_date: 2018-05-21 03:49:27
4 years ago about 150$, I didn’t buy any ������
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:10:10
I heard the Spanish tax office have asked Spanish banks to report to them about customers buying crypto, have bought all mine via Coinbase with a bank card, now my bank is very friendly with me and the assistant manager who deals with my account (have a good business account) keeps telling me how banks are in trouble and they are not making money, negative interest rates that cost them money on large current accounts, etc. I do not care if they know I am buying crypto, not doing anything illegal, will pay tax on what I withdraw, plenty of other banks to deal with if this one becomes a problem
@_date: 2018-05-29 19:22:18
It will moon very soon but I am not convinced in a financial crises it will do well, I think interest rates will spike in 3/4 years, if we get global adoption of crypto it might be a different matter, if not everyone will cash out as they will need fiat
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:53:58
29th of May 
 
@_date: 2018-05-19 17:36:42
My money goes from fiat to crypto, so I will keep using a fiat coin as a reference, maybe once I can live completely of crypto I will change
@_date: 2018-05-29 19:16:01
I agree, perhaps we will see another drop before it all moons
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:58:33
You mean not even Bcash? Lol
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:12:58
Awesome, buy the dip if you can, hodl if you can’t 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:18:16

And the whales were expecting us
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:55:08
Agreed, will have some red today or tomorrow again, regulations needed, I will be buying more soon, just waiting for the last small dip
@_date: 2018-08-10 22:04:45
Will put a note in my diary and we can discuss and resolve the problem in 110/120 years time
@_date: 2018-05-29 19:47:54
I can see another small dip, just have a feeling, lines can be broken if enough are dumped on exchanges, regardless, we are nearly there, what colour lambo are you going for lol? I really like how “Lamborghini Huracane Performante” sounds if you say it with an Italian accent
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:47:40
Yes agreed, definitely avoiding, thanks 
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:15:51
Preparing to buy the dip, so will be happy if prices drop, if not and prices increase my portfolio goes up in value, a win win
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:10:56
In 5 years we may have quantum computers and bitcoin might no longer be secure, I think you would double your money in less than 18 months with btc if not by August this year
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:49:43
Change banks if that is the case or ask ing if you can open a savings account and work with the bank, due to negative interest rates it costs them money to have cash in a current account, don’t get me wrong, am all for fighting banks but until we have a decent crypto debit card we have no choice but to work with them
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:57:47
Haha, I know the feeling
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:06:19
Hopefully they will approve something for October November  
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:26:56
Doesn’t Barclays work with Coinbase? I am sure I read something along this lines

@_date: 2018-08-24 13:40:27

And wait, and wait and wait some more haha
@_date: 2018-05-26 03:59:55
I would avoid it, a friend almost joined cryptominingfarm.io I looked into it and they have a great option for mining tether, it is not possible to mine tether, the highest rated cloud mining site is Genesis mining, someone posted here recently that it was also a scam
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:22:26
Interested also
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:30:01
They will once we have regulations but I hardly think the entire euro fiat system has collapsed yet, bare in mind every country uses the same currency
@_date: 2018-05-28 22:16:58
I agree, I don’t think they will go under till the next financial crash, I don’t think that will be in 2018 either
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:49:16
They will delay 9 applications in September 
@_date: 2018-05-30 03:23:14
Yes it it ������

@_date: 2018-05-27 19:29:34
It is scary that these idiots are the ones that will regulate crypto, let me see, let’s use the 80 year old law about securities to enforce rules on brand new tech that will change the world we live in

Do they accept crypto, do they have WiFi so I can check my portfolio 150 times a day?
@_date: 2018-05-29 19:14:43
I agree it will moon and I think soon, not just yet but soon, I doubt We will see stability in crypto for a while yet though, I couldn’t care less about stability to be honest, it comes with the trade as they say
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:13:04
Can I inspect the bitcoins first in my wallet?
@_date: 2018-05-18 04:13:58
So on that basis (0,5% this year, nearly 400% increase to next year) TA of this shows bitcoin will use all of the worlds energy in 5 years, is there an energy ico I can invest in, am all in on tether at the moment but should diversify a bit

Thanks for this, my friend went to a course yesterday and they recommended cloud mining and sent him a link that has a referral code included, been looking into it and came to same conclusion, they pay in usd that they convert to btc at the time and send btc, so your not really earning btc. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 21:01:27
I think once the g20 issues guideline regulations in July it will boom again
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:02:27
I have not tried withdrawing via coinbase yet, so what happens to the transfers you send them? I take they get returned? Silly question but does you bank account name match your coinbase name?
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:59:18
I think we are a long way from that
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:41:18

Its the custody of the coins that an investment fund will not have setup, they must be insured also so it will be cheaper for the investment fund to use a custody service than to get their own insured  custody service together, it’s how they play the game, as long as it results in a major btc price increase I don’t care what they do

@_date: 2018-10-08 19:11:26
So with a static bike you can generate enough power to turn on your phone and as long as the miners are peddling away like crazy somewhere else in the world you would be fine with crypto lol

Do you mean 10,000$ in btc or 10,000 btc? If it’s the latter that means 65.000.000$. However it would be great if the btc price dropped to 1600$, I could buy a few

Am with you there, my bank sent me a full questionnaire asking how much i earn, where my income comes from, what’s my job title etc. However that being said, it is all part of the governments kyc and aml requirements, so we can expect this crap from exchanges in the future too

Haha, angry old men are entertaining, he probably also did the space a favor, I have a feeling the commission saw how much he hates bitcoin and his arguments were more than just logical arguments against blockchain and crypto

I registered with binance and submitted id, I buy via bank transfer to coinbase and then send to binance, I do swap fiat for etc and send etc to binance

I fully agree, this is why ICE is launching bakkt, why fidelity is getting involved, why major US universities are investing in crypto funds, why the IMF has issued recommendations for global regulations, why FATF has announced they will blacklist any country with an exchange that has not complied with regulations by next June, why the G20 have been discussing crypto, why Spain is insisting all residents declare their crypto holdings, all of this is because it is going to completely disappear next week. You had better sell now, or better still, just send me your coins for free, it is so obvious nothing is ever going to happen in this space ever again, one of the best new technologies human kind has invented and it will just disappear without a trace the day after tomorrow. The internet will be turned off by Christmas and everyone is going to through their computers away, you had better invest in hammer and chisels as that is how all data will be recorded in 2019, by hammers now before the shops run out!!!!

@_date: 2018-10-22 08:27:58
Guess we will find out, I see how they could enforce regulations on the exchanges but in the new FATF publications they do state digital wallets as a regulation requirement

I agree and when I clicked on the article and read “bitcoin had its first major sell off in months last week” I just closed it. If the issue was just down to tether then surely they would swap to a different stablecoin

I agree, g20 meeting next month will be the start, weather this means the markets will surge or long term players will get out and price will drop before it goes back up I honestly don’t know, regardless, I am buying more crypto! As I buy a set amount each month, probably wise to save a bit till after the g20 meeting in case it does drop.
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:33:41
They can’t sell any till February 2019 though

It could go up but it could also go down, don’t invest if you can’t afford to leave the money for 3 years, or perhaps even lose it, the stress will not be worth it, take a small amount of money, what you can forget about and invest that only

I don’t think they would proceed without knowing they have all the boxes ticked so it would definitely be approved, it will be approved by the ctfc not the sec, the cboe already has futures approved so no reason why not
If they don’t, more cheap btc I suppose

No credit card debt at all, I did have 6k in card debt and a low paying job, I basically got my wages and paid the monthly card fees and live off the the valve I cleared, it was a horrible existence, never again, I do have a mortgage but I intend to clear that in the next 10 years and then live completely debt free, credit cards are a wage sucking, life draining misery that just naked the bank a shitload of money, my 6k card debt made the banks 1.2k in interest each year, you are better off getting a loan and clearing card debts as long as you have the discipline not to build them up again.
Get rid of credit cards everyone, then clear your loans and live debt free, do not spend your lives working hard to make money for banks, adjust your budgets as much as you can, every time you swipe your card think of the bank smiling and saying thank you!!
@_date: 2018-11-18 17:49:00
There is no bitcoin etf, so how can you compare?
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:55:14
So just like paying your taxes in Ohio then? You give them bitcoin, they give you coffee, as their suppliers don’t accept bitcoin yet they have to convert to fiat and pay suppliers and staff

I was quite surprised when I looked into this, with SEPA it’s 24 hours anywhere in Europe, I was also surprised to find out that Americans still use checks, I stopped accepting checks in my business a few years ago, I never use a check for anything at all, I don’t even own a check book

Woohoooo, we will be using crypto in the EU before the sec has finished reading comments from the public about a bitcoin etf!!
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:33:31
My understanding is that they can launch  and submit a request for approval the same day
@_date: 2019-01-17 21:43:13
Coinbase is not free, there is a charge when you swap from your fiat wallet to a crypto wallet of about 1,5%

I use coinbase and have no problems, I am in Spain, my bank can take up to 48 hours to process my transfer but it tends to be in my coinbase euro wallet by 8:30 the day after they have sent the transfer, even if the bank sends it at 15:00. Not sure why it would take 21 days for you.
@_date: 2019-01-17 11:26:50
Are they higher than coinbase for a fiat deposit?
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:45:51
Then we will get a 9x rejection
@_date: 2018-11-07 17:05:24
It might surprise you to know that 2019 is actually after 2018.
You have not read the article have you? November 5th was the deadline for anyone wanting to submit comments about a bitcoin etf. Then the deadline for persons submitting comments is finalized and the SEC start reading those comments after November 5th.
So back to my original comment, 2019 is actually after November the 5th 2018
The SEC has already said the need the exchanges regulated before they will approve an ETF, we won’t see a bitcoin ETF until all the exchanges have complied with the FATF rules that were issued a couple of weeks ago giving the exchanges till June 2019 to comply

@_date: 2018-11-28 07:30:41
I did not send them a selfie if I recall, just id but I opened my account on February, I have to say I have never had a single problem, my bank sent them a transfer yesterday evening and it’s available at 8 am today in my wallet too, very efficient service
@_date: 2018-07-18 19:46:55
That reference of crypto bring like a rifle that does not leave a fingerprint, the whole thing was a joke
@_date: 2018-07-10 21:12:52
I work in Euros so the transfer of the Euros amount just sits in the app until I decide to buy btc with it, in the app it gives me a wallet for Euros, bitcoin, bitcoin cash, lite coin, Ethereum, they are all the same and in theory I could swap between each currency as I see fit, I just HODL though
@_date: 2018-07-06 19:25:17
Totally agree, my life is so much better without Facebook 
@_date: 2018-07-11 14:24:14
Does anyone think this can be imposed on crypto wallets?
@_date: 2018-07-23 11:15:05
I read btc could be derailed by a central bank crypto as it would be competition 
How concerned are we that central banks legalize and validate all crypto by joining in and issuing their own coins and giving us a secure stablecoin? 
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:02:24
Your comment in the post heading made it sound like all ETFs would be delayed, I just wanted to clarify that was not the case
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:46:23
I use Coinbase but send them a bank transfer, no fees at all 
@_date: 2018-07-25 18:48:44
Which etf are you referí get too?
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:39:14
Maybe seeing what happens with end of July futures? Regardless, we are getting one hell of a support level for all coins
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:01:17
So there might be a delay with the VEck/SolidX ETF but other ETFs may be approved in a Couple of weeks, especially the CBOE ETF which I think is the main ETF!!

There will be no argument that a btc hater will agree too, what makes me laugh is why the btc haters follow the bitcoin sub in Reddit, I just checked and gold has increased by about 200$ an ounce if I am reading the chart right, about 20% since 2010, I think crypto is in its infancy so also not a fair comparison, I suppose we should compare the price of btc from 2020 to 2030, regardless, the next 6 months are going to be very interesting if you hodl crypto
@_date: 2018-07-22 09:38:43
What if that “better price” is all of a sudden 9k?
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:41:02
Thanks, just wasn’t sure, then I see this eu rule as very good news for us all then, role on g20 meeting next week
@_date: 2018-07-22 08:10:09
Now ask all of those who think that btc will drop in the next weeks if they have sold all their crypto with the intention of buying back when it drops or are they just hodling just in case it does not drop. I recommend buying some today before the g20 press release in a few hours (I think it is 4pm argentina time but don’t quote me on that) save some cash and if it drops further buy the dip

@_date: 2018-07-10 22:48:05
You definitely have to do your own research in crypto, spend the time looking into each project, the problem is anyone who has invested money will tell you the one they have invested in is the one that will triumph, I have only been involved in crypto since this February so I am also looking into good projects, also, once I have changed my Euros to crypto, I then send them to binance exchange and can there swap them to the coins I want to buy and keep, you have options to buy many more coins in binance then via the coinbase app, don’t keep too much on an exchange though
@_date: 2018-07-27 18:31:24
