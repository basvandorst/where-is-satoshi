Exact thoughts. You think how much the us govt exceeds it's authority. Imagine when it laws dont even matter. They just make them up.

Wow you actually responded to almost everyone! I'm impressed!

I'd like to caution you about his insurance policy. This would nt be covered under accounts receivable. Infact no insurance policies are currently covering it. 
I have spear headed within my company adoption of insurance policy for bitcoin. Needless to say I'm fighting an uphill battle.
Edit: this isn't a he should stop. I am 1000% on board with this! Especially in the auto industry. But more so he needs to be careful. 
@_date: 2014-04-29 17:04:11
Yes I have. About 10 seperate times.

On our side it presents that matter of which bitcoin is not currency nor is it property. It's in that legal grey matter. Until case law decides what happens.

This is awesome. I wish I had some btc. I don't yet :(
@_date: 2014-05-20 22:02:05
Absolutely! I just want some people to understand the legalities. Having btc stolen from you right now is a very large grey area.

I bet you someone brings the pain train to karples. I hope he has security for his well being.

Why not get alibaba asking it's merchants too as well
@_date: 2014-05-09 12:42:51
Absolutely it will. The officers had a legitimate reason to protect themselves.

Hey bud, insurance sales here too, you first need to convince our companies and industry to cover bitcoin like we do with money. That is going to be the first step for our industry. I am spearheading this as well with mine. Best of luck!

Bitcoin has been mentioned a Few times on almost human. Pretty damn cool. They had a "bitcoin stick" tonight where simply touching USB gave the other person money.
