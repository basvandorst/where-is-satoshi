Cash App's silence on this shit is deafening...

My feeling is, they are hoping people will do a "test" run like you did, then discover the impossibility of ever adding cash again coupled with trouble transferring to third-party wallets, and eventually chalk it up as a loss.
And, I imagine somewhere in your terms you agreed to, it says something like, "If your account is inactive for XXXXX length of time, we get to steal your shit."
There is no good reason for this not being handled quickly.
EDIT: And again I'm going to say it... THIS is what is holding the crypto-markets back. It is d\*mn near impossible just to buy some g\*ddamn crypto and get in in the market. Oh yeah, places like Coinbase will let you transfer out after 16 days, however on days like today, you get fu\*king murdered in the market because you can't even run and hide in Tether and are limited to 5 coins (which all happen to follow each other in the market). Tell me, how does the Bitcoin get to $1,000,000,000 per coin, if no one can fu\*king buy it? I just want to put my money into Bittrex/Binance and start trading for God's sake! This market is being cornered and monopolized (at least in NY) and the crypto-community needs to start being vocal about this sh\*t.

Same exact thing for me... Here looking for a resolution. Frustrated. Should be trading RIGHT NOW!

So, you had to give them remote access to your computer??? After they already hosed you... No thanks. We deserve better than that.
