Heck, in the US I was able to ask my Samsung GS5 "Okay Google, What's a Bitcoin worth?"  The TTS engine announced back "1 B.T.C. equals six hundred twenty five United States Dollars and sixty two cents."

Yep, TFA is actually quite lulzy because the guy is claiming the senator agrees with his untenable position.  Quite the opposite, the senator tells this joker to fuck off, citing the rulings from the IRS (and eluding to statements made by the chair of the fed).

Nice try, ISIS guy.

Likewise.  Your pseudo-intellectualism is showing.

Or, you know, don't to business with terrorists.  Unless you want a free one-way trip back to America courtesy of the Department of Justice.
Actually, cancel that.  If your business takes off, who knows!  You could get a free one-way trip to a tropical navy base in Cuba!  No drinks with little umbrellas, though. :( Sorry, chap.

I'm going to make a wild assumption and say that the vast majority of those immigrants are not trying to market an "anti USD currency" back in Iran.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:51:30
 &gt; Thats exactly what I also thought of! It can be advertised as an anti USD currency! If there are good incentives on BTC for Iranian government, it wouldnot be impossible that Iranian banks and government invest on it!
abeikverdi's post from the aforementioned thread.
Yeah, clearly there are no intentions of skirting international sanctions imposed against one of the world's largest state-sponsors of terrorism.  (If not the single largest sponsor... Upset because he got banned for trying to buy bitcoin from an American company, for use in bolstering a country whose motto is "Death to America" - oh the irony.  Irony that is no doubt further compounded when abeikverdi chooses an American-owned and American-run website to air his "grievances".)
Furthermore, expect that efforts to expand into North Korea will meet similar resistance.  Next time, perhaps try to start a business in a country that isn't considered a terrorist nation or rogue nation.

Uh.... What?  I'm just going to leave this here.  You know bitcoin proof of work is only possible because "encryption" right?  Encryption is just really "difficult" asymmetric math.

This is absolutely a brute force attack. It attempts every passcode combination possible and reports the success.  What part about this device makes you think it's *not* performing a brute force attack?  The relevant discussion to this case is exclusively tied to an iOS 7 target phone.

Looks like it's shaping up to be one hell of a double-peak.  Where my quants at?!

You've made my entire point.  It's stored thus readable.  If you make the key yourself, as with any other AES implementation where the symmetric key requires a strong passphrase, it would take a whole lot more than $100k to break the encryption.  You'd need what amounts to nearly limitless computing power and time, both of which are slightly more expensive than an electron microscope or chip rip.

Except there are very few fundamentals to the BTC exchanges, even MtGox with its  ranking in volume.  Trying to daytrade on traditional analysis is pretty silly.

Did you read the same document I read?  The only true secret is the device UID which Apple claims it has no knowledge of and claims is completely unreadable by any software or firmware. (Page 7 paragraphs 4 &amp; 5)
Claiming the UID is unreadable assumes that no one is going to be disassembling the hardware the intentions of dumping the defined "unreadable" bits.  You think the UID is actually permanently unreadble?  Then how does the AES engine use it to symmetrically encrypt (and decrypt)? The key must be read, and because the key is stored on-device and static and unchangable, the encryption is easily bypassed if the hardware is accessible and disassembled sufficiently.

As Butterfly pointed out, SSL does not equal integrity checking.  It does have some level of identity verification but that's easily forged.  DNSSEC might mitigate impostor downloads but that's about it in terms of what they can do server-side besides supplying the signature as they've done.  GPG signatures cannot be forged and they provide full integrity checking and identity verification.
