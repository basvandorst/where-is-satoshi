Felt lazy for asking, made it myself (not the best)

A good one I recently heard: If you bought high and you are down. Buy again at a lower price to lower your avg. buy in price

Where is this from?

I agree, it's still hard for people to take the first step. Anything we can do to make it easier for them will help BTC in the end.

What about tradin on GDAX? 0 fees, so no loss on the buy/sell rates then? I was thinking of just playing with maybe 100 bucks to see if i'm able to make it into more

Nice! I wish my friends would listen to me, i've been telling them to do that for a year now. Just a small amount each paycheck..

We use comma's before the decimals. Like: 10,99 and we use periods to show the one-thousand marks like: 1.000,99  
The dash is just to show the decimal is zero and it looks more fancy :)

Cheers! Thank you

Hey man, really like your style and your art! I've been thinking of getting a new tattoo. Would you be willing to help me sketch up something from my ideas? For Satoshis ofcourse

@_date: 2018-05-08 04:49:16
Looks awesome! But why they gotta show almost the entire movie in the trailer? I feel like i've seen the whole movie already
@_date: 2018-05-24 08:44:56

@_date: 2017-11-30 04:56:34

BTC is illegal in Thailand. You're not allowed to bring in or take out BTC of the country ;)
