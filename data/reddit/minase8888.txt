I didn't mean it's difficult to achieve technically. It's just that there needs to be an obvious demand and strong trust from merchant side to start implementing it. If we talk online we need to see the big players accepting it first (e.g: Amazon, eBay, Spotify etc.). As for physical outlets I would say the transition is even slower as credit/debit cards and cash are way too popular and I don't see why there would be huge demand to pay with BTC (especially while it's really difficult to buy some, why would you spend it on clothes or groceries?) There are several local payment methods in EU countries that work with mobile apps and QR codes (E.g: iDeal in NL, P24 in PL, Sofort in DE). These solutions allow instant payments, directly debiting your bank account. Unfortunately even these don't really make it to physical shops while they would be even more obvious. 
I agree with you, there could be some 3rd party solutions that process BTC in the background. For example some of the more advanced POS machines already ask if you prefer to pay in your own currency (e.g: when you pay with an EUR card in the US). This can save you some exchange fees and appears more simply in your statement. So a card (or other means of payment) could potentially process BTC in the background, but then again you lost all the beauty of (nearly) free processing and direct, anonymus trade. So why would you want to process in BTC again?

I get you and I also think that lightweight and user friendly wallet solutions combined with trustworthy protocols are the way to the mainstream. However that is only the tool. There needs to be more people who 'naturally earn Bitcoin to make a living and are willing to spend BTC'.
Now if you're a web dev and ask your client for BTC as preferred payment, most likely it is for trading aspect, rather than to buy groceries.
So yeah it would be refreshing to see BTC generally accepted both offline and online, I just don't see any immediate driving forces. Not nearly as much as there is on the 'owning a BTC for its potential future value' camp.

This would also mean they cannot take action on any fraudulent transactions within the blockchain. Only when it's related to real currency purchase/sales. It's pretty weird situation.

I fund it amusing to think that these are bankers and Wall Street brokers who passionately hate Bitcoin.

Maybe he legit supports bitcoin, but I can't help to think when someone does something like this they're just trying to boost the price so they can sell high.
