The owners are happy because of the item's value. It's not like they're playing games with antique furniture.

*Odysseus* is in the public domain, but Homer still matters. Just because the source code is public doesn't mean the person who originally came up with it is irrelevant.

You probably weren't the only person Mr. Casey spoke to, so why should it be your views solely represented in his article?

It doesn't really matter if the supply of bitcoins is kept under 21 million if people judge their worth based on the dollar, and that value can fluctuate so much that the value of bitcoin can halve in a day. Until bitcoins aren't judged based on their value tied to another currency, all they are is a volatile investment.

He has a point, though. Bitcoin does not have any intrinsic value that the dollar doesn't have. They are both fiat currencies with value predicated upon the fact that people agree they have value. just likes to circlejerk about how awful money is, forgetting that Bitcoin suffers from many of the same problems money has.

It's a B with a vertical line through it, like the dollar sign ($). There is no unicode sign for it, though some possible alternatives to adopt would be: 𝓑 (U+1D4D1), 𝔹 (U+1D539), or maybe even a B with a combining accent of your choice, or just use BTC.
EDIT: I stand corrected. Beer_is_Better found this: ฿

Now does it give out cash in exchange for bitcoins?

If those are U.S. dollars in the last picture, then yes, this is what we really do.

That's the problem, isn't it? If Bitcoin is a constantly deflating currency, there's an incentive to save rather than spend. If there is such a thing as a Bitcoin economy, this constantly deflating currency will hinder Bitcoin's presence in the market.
