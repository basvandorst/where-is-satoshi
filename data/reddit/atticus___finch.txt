It seems like op is trying to extract abstract value to blockchain(Bitcoin specifically) as a replacement/ alternative to the ubiquitis database solution to software problems.
I agree this is somewhat covered by "distributed ledger" but sometimes people need to put it into their own words to "get it"

I guess I mean: we can still store an updated state(with benefit of state reversion) in terms of Read operations without using the CRUD style replace/update.  
So instead of replacing ("President", "Washington") keypair db value with ("President", "Adams") we append "Adams" to the president branch and retrieve the value knowing what came before.

Well, given enough storage (distributed) isn't updating somewhat possible in form and deleting potentially undesirable?
Treating DB like we treat version control my have advantages.

To be honest I think a lot of what you are saying is just mental masturbation.  Of course humans are psychological creatures, but that is already priced in for the most part. The volatility is due to the lack of regulation and lack of confidence in market regulations and long term store of value . Beyond that you are just chasing your own tail.

I mean Im an early BTC investor so obviously biased, but I don't think it's *mainstream* yet based on what I hear daily from people outside those who have already invested in btc or crypto. We are still (in 2018) the early adopters, globally speaking. 
Once we get regulation and true govt approved legal status in more countries the trust in store of value goes up. It's a matter of time,. 1 year, 3 years, 5 years?  Just gotta weather the insecurity and panic selling which will continue and keep conservative investors sceptical until then.

I have no idea but I don't think they are even thinking that far ahead.  Central govt are reactive not generally forward thinking.  A concerted effort like that would take a lot of planning and forsight that I don't believe exists in the mainstream. Crypto is still small in most people's eyes ( false imo) but that's the perception.  Just look at buffet etc.. they think it's just a fad.
Edit: I mean sure, govt plans ahead , but they plan ahead based on the old rules. They are generally slower to adopt than private industry.

True, I see what you are saying and agree, the risk is worth it imo if you can handle the short term volatility.

I mean sure, anything is possible. If there is anything learned from  Long Term Capital Management(they had the biggest brains and the govt connections and still went bust)  it is  that the past  is not always a reliable prediction of the future. I personally want to bet on natural long term adoption not on Black swan events.

To be fair I think you are adding a few too many zeroes (and I know you meant as a high end low % chance) based on current value. I have btc hitting about 10-50x current value in the 10year time frame. Very optimistic but not crazy 1000x talk
