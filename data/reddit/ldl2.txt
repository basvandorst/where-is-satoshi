This is actually heavily out of context.  The entire thing is about how fascism served as a stop gap from socialists and communists from taking away all private property.  It should seem ironic that someone who is a liberal (presumed) should not understand this.  The current economic model is one not far off from the *economics* of fascism.  This is what you currently want and why you can claim "no, no, I'm not a socialist"  Private property exist so long as the government doesn't want to take it, but money and property are the governments at their behest.  So yes in comparison to a society that eliminates private property, one of that nature was considered favorable.
Here is the full passage if you doubt the context: 
Also keep in mind the time of publishing was during the Mussolini fascism 1929 this was published not following the Hitler rise.  This is not to say his rise was without conflict/deaths, but certainly not what was to come.

Here's from a wiki made by me.  I guess the wikipedia you meant is from the page I moderate and made a year ago.  




Tell me then is "communist" Russia closest to communist, socialist, or fascist in their ideal?


Wow red herring much?  What the flying fuck did corporations come into the picture since we talked.  Oh your just a troll I keep forgetting.  As long as I throw that in there you will keep responding and looking like the damn fool you are.


I could school you on the difference.  Easily.  You have no idea what the fuck you're talking about.  A piss poor standard for socialists.  Show where I conflated the two?  Oh you can't because I never mentioned communism or anything exclusive to it.  Here's the fundamental difference to me.  A socialist could work hand in hand with libertarian society with no problem.  A communist cannot.   -both precluding state socialist/communist which functionally is fascism.  If you can explain that you know the difference, but you don't.

Yea what an asshoel not hoping fro the ruination of a country.  Fucking read it outside of the quote you are handed from libertarian hating blogs.
That is the only wordplay, what is written and read from someone with a brain.
Yes I'm a liberal before fascists in America decided to take over the term because progressive stunk of too much shit.  In fact the quote you took if from Mises' book *Liberalism*.  You'd know that if you even half bothered to click the link, before engaging in your self validation and desire to argue.  What is the reinterpretation.  The common interpretation of liberal in America.  ffs I'm out of control, Hitlerian in fact. 
Wait is it because I ascribed fascism to current liberals.  Uh State run economies, and nationalism.  Why are neoconservatives called as such...they came from liberalism to conservatism in the late 50's early 60's.  It was their policy.  They were fascists in all regards.  So what a surprise they still use their economic policy of progressives/liberals in America.  We keep playing name changes through out history.


Bra-fucking-vo.  May your proletariat unite any day now.  Every attempt to make it so has resulted in fascism as well, which is why you get to sit on your laurels and say that wasn't socialism.

What?  So you are mad libertarians support "subsidies" by tax code but you support them.  ~The handouts we both want to get rid of?
Ok lets go to the next one.


1) Why is it low?  The current value is approx 6 times the value in the 1960's which was often considered a livable wage  It is almost like libertarians offer another reason how not to cause this problem in the first place.  If only I could remember what it was.  Something Something gold.
2) Who does this hurt?  These with the lowest skill sets.  Teen unemployment increases.  Those without HS educations are hurt as their job is replaced.
3) You presume a lack of minimum wage results in a lack of payment.  The rise of the [Chinese middle class]( begs to differ.  As unemployment drops something must lure the average work from one job to the next.

So the social contract is not morally just so what is its value in being argued here.  Surely then the argument is consequential?  But we already ruled out the consequence as being that of theft.  You have no justification for this proposed social contract other than to say it is the law and we must follow the law for no reason. Sorry if I don't buy that argument.  Ultimately now your consequentialist argument is you we steal from your wallet but buy you a cheeseburger.  But surely there is no other way I can achieve that cheeseburger...  


You are proposing something unreasonable.  There is no way to reasonably discuss it without pointing out there is no basis for what you say.  You find that offensive?  Sorry If I don' get giddy and you must accept that because you already did, wait when what.  It's a joke of an argument.  I made this up so you must follow it.  Why don't you cite god as the reason.

I mean their efforts to trap music downloaders only go so far, so the gut wants to say the digital world can stay ahead of them.  On the other end of that spectrum this inherently requires transactions to be valuable.  This is how they are able to monitor payroll, income and sales and all this for other taxation methods which is where this invariably leads.  Does it remain viable for small transactions.   Does it still serve as a storage for wealth?

Person A has position X.  
Person B presents position Y (which is a distorted version of X).  
Person B attacks position Y.  
Therefore X is false/incorrect/flawed.
-1 Society has decided that you're a bad guy if you engage in tax evasion whether you like it or not.
Position is society decides who is right.
-2 Society also decided to pretend the Earth is flat
Position society has decided wrong in the past, does that make it universally correct?
So lets go back:
Person A has position X. check  
Person B presents position X as wrong in the past, check, but what is the distortion what is the Y?


First, I consider T-O as a friend.  I will defend my friends against creeps.  If I think he's wrong I have no problem saying so.  e.g. I'm a Georgist, he is not.  I have no problem telling him I think his position is wrong and why.  I don't have much of a problem with you saying so.  But that isn't what you are doing.  You are following him around and slandering him personally rather than engaging him over 50% of the time (I suppose this here is a potential counter example to that).  But here and other times you are releasing personal information about him.  You can say well it is a matter of the public record, but so is where my gf walks.  If you are following her around, damn right I'm going to start following you around.  I've never felt the need to randomly post on t-o's comments before unless I felt I could add my perspective or a point.  That includes when he debates people, but you aren't doing that.
Not only that you are a coward about it, but I suppose most stalkers are.  You made a sock puppet to follow him around.  What's wrong don't want someone going through your goodies?

Relevance? 


[And]( by libertarianism


It is really a pain to try to compare countries especially when you are asking me to compare to several countries.  What is the cause of what.  Their taxes are almost the same as ours with the exception of the VAT in most these countries (except sweden).  Is it because of wars.  Is it because they are still having an increase in housing indicating a [real bubble existing still](  is it becuase They had a recession in 92' that far exceeded any we had?  Is it because some of them have been able to rely on oil to subsidize their programs when we haven't done that (well except alaska)?  Is it just not true when you group them that they are any [happier]( by any margin.  
@_date: 2013-03-20 19:16:44
The typical problem is a difference in terminology.  Those on the left identify special lower tax rates as subsidies while those on the right do not.  But those on the left believe in subsidies (block government spending (edit: to businesses) rather than reduced collecting) much more readily than others.  Green energy as a common example.  So I have proposed the middle ground many times and rarely get acceptance.  I will accept your definition if you are willing to say no subsidies, period.

Doesn't it seem odd that the vast majority of social contracts in history have proven shitty?  What is the cause of belief that ours is so much more special?  It relies on the same principles.  Implement the will of the majority on the minority (and sometimes the reverse for kicks) and force it upon those who disagree with us by jailing and hurting people.  That is *the* better system?  It must be comforting to believe that...Faith must be so wonderful.  
Faith consists in believing when it is beyond the power of reason to believe.

Overall, and interesting look into your motives I guess I'd call them.  In parts I agree and in parts I disagree.  Only a few of which I think I'll address
Generally speaking I don't have a problem with the fact it illicits an emotional response as you would put it.  I mean image the thought wow 
I'm a racist  
I'm helped out by another race  
my god I've been wrong the whole time (a la American history X)
It will form an emotional response, no matter what, to find previous actions have caused harm.  Assuming you feel feelings.
But you kind of need to walk someone up to that point logically and your real complaint is in being to aggressive those too far away are not able to make that jump, in fact think of you as too far to reason with.  The problem, I suppose, here is it is subjective from the consumer of the information where the point that you must be at before making that jump is.  Now what you are saying I assume is he is catering to a minority population, maybe extreme minority.  I honestly don't know.  I will tell you my own experience is I don't make perspective changes during arguments very frequently.  His style is very suitable to this version because it is quick and to the point and I'm just stuck rolling it through my head


I think you will see a different mode take place.  He is clearly a passionate individual.  I could be wrong but his passion wont be that which it is now.  It will transform from preacher to the best darn PR rep (passion for good v passion for bad).  I mean the entire reason I am on is him telling us why me what is so good about it, what can be done with it, how it is growing ect ect.  So I don't think this theoretical situation will be all that concerning with him personally.  I can see issues with it being over-run by conspiracy theory people, or similar situations that lead to this perception though.

Well the least densely populated place in the world is Iceland.  Lets compare their murder rate 1 per 100k to cities in the US shall we?

In fact it is usually the other way around.  But I assume this isn't what you really mean.  You mean places with developed governments compared to not developed government but began with a xenophobic approach that the less government places have nobody around and are backwoods.

This presumably is available on the market.  I pay for its use like anyone else, so I do't need to.  If you want you can convince government to place tarrifs on it or restrict it but that is uncommon practice these days with the exception of "axis of evil" nations.  Basically you'd have to pass a law.


Ok, that is again the government's right now are people allowed to voluntarily opt out of the government, because the list of private properties I could go to is going to expand drastically if I can get everyone on this belief.

I strongly believe that anarchy can only exist post-state, whereby the state does institute concepts like the rule of law etc.  People must learn how to interact with one another before they have the desire for systems independent of force to instill them.  Fortunately much of the western world and lots elsewhere too have lived in one.  Now it is time to move past that.

I didn't sign a contract and your response is very clear here.  Might makes right, because you have the majority.  This is a response that says if we make the rule that slavery is legal then it is morally just.  Leave if you don't like it, oh we made that illegal too.  Too bad, shouldn't have signed that contract by being born here.  That is the moral equivalent of what you argue.  Or more current, like homosexual rights, sorry you don't get those and it is moral.  Go bring those up to those communities, tell me how it goes.
