if you read the link, it leans more towards it not being fake. maybe non-official but it also says these suggestions are real. seems like b00mc1ap lacks reading comprehnsion.

Oh your comment wasn't asinine at all and added so much value.

But the reasons you gave are not limited to bitcoin. Happens to everything in the financial industry. Why are you so mad at bitcoin?

How so? 


It's not really meant as an investment instrument anyway


What? Have you ever even used it or do you frequently talk out of your ass?


The point is mainstream FI's are aware of the tech and many of their educated employees are also aware and very interested in it. These people and others like them could be potentially building the so called "killer app". The more an idea is circulated the more it has a chance to develop.


There's no evidence here of anything, just an anecdote I found interesting


I would argue that the buzz isn't around those who are already financially invested in it, but from those who keep their ears to the ground for disruptive tech. Again those who will develop the idea further.


You are funny, but probably don't work in a corporate environment or around the tech industry if you haven't heard that particular phrase. There is meaning behind it more than just fluff, but you need to educate yourself.


How so? Repeating ignorant statements is not really debate. Also, its lazy.


Again, I am not financially invested in bitcoin. I have used it, and I have played around with bitcoin investing using disposable funds. I have made and lost money, and there is no doubt that bitcoin is highly volatile. My real purpose is to see if you had some real reason to be so snarky regarding a technology. I really am interested in the whole story, pros and cons, but you only seem capable of snarky retorts. I'm bored now. You can continue your weak trolling, but unless you have something of substance I think I'm done reading your ignorant prattle.

I'll leave it at this - bitcoin is not perfect, but nothing is. The tech behind crypto-currency is revolutionary. Even if bitcoin fails, the tech is not going away. Even if it never becomes mainstream, it already has uses and benefits that are beyond what traditional currency and methods of value transfer simply cannot provide. Somehow, somewhere down the line this tech will become dominant, maybe not in its current incarnation but that's fine. For someone to be so vitriolic towards a technology is silly. The only reasons I can think you'd act this way are: One, you got burned or two, you are shorting bitcoins using daddy's money and want to drive the price down further.

Yea technology always loses in the end. Wait...

What about making an analogy to Linux? Something like "It's open source and the community is the true owner"

Hey fuckwad c'mon, tell me where the bitcoin touched you.

No, but there's a few other reasons. For example, their insistent attempts to monopolize technology which would stifle innovation from competitors. They tried it with their desktops, and they tried with the iPhone. Thankfully innovation outpaced them even though they are the innovators of the original idea. Maybe that's not evil, so much as pathetic but it's why I'm not a fan.

I was able to view the article once, but after my attempt to open the site again I got blocked by a subscription pop-up.

You still haven't made any points, just continue to argue and make ad hominem attacks. No substance all fluff. Personal insults don't win arguments in the real world but if you were more than just an angry loser you'd know that. 
By the way - disruptive innovation is pretty simple. Look at what the mp3 did to music. It was an innovation, and disrupted the music industry. It was a game changer.  I also see you use the insult frequently. Do you get mad at people smarter than you? 
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:00:05
Oh ok, so you are just a stupid fucking troll who can't back up shit and just talks shit. Ok fuck face keep going

I said 'a technology', by that I mean crypto currency, a broader category than bitcoin which you crticized earlier. I don't necessarily think bitcoin is a sound investment but the transfer of real money via cryptographic protocols over the internet is disruptive innovation and can't be ignored. Working in a financial institution with a computer science degree I paid for, I often participate in tech conventions that are internally hosted. Not all the sessions are popular but the one on bitcoin was standing room only, with both protractors and detractors eager to voice an opinion. To think the core innovation behind bitcoin is a passing fancy is to ignore history and the inevitable.

I was waiting for some money to clear to be able to buy. I missed the bubble but my bitcoin transaction has just been entered (as of 30 min ago). I guess I'll have to wait and see what price I end up paying...

Unrelated to bitcoin - any recommended books from someone that wants to start trading on the side? I've made a few decent calls and watched them turn out to be accurate. I think I might be able to turn out a profit but not sure where to start.
