In a interview the vice-chairman of RBI (the second in-charge of the Central Bank of India) said that they are fine with people trading and exchanging money for btc and vice-versa between themselves.  
Its not really much of a problem IMO -- The people here commenting don't know the reality in India. The reality here between the 'whales' or the big players in India is that they all are Black Money players afaik. They use cash and large large sums of it.  
This just prevents the common person from investing his $100 or whatever

When you have btc from 2012, having tens of em at least was quite normal.

Wish BTCC gave an explanation though so that we know if it's just a BTCC thing or all Chinese exchanges

Mt. Gox collapsed at a time just after $1200 per BTC. Lol. But yes it existed much much before that at the time when 10,000 btc would be spent for a pizza.

What happens to the excess Bitcoins / USD that will be left over since everyone is being compensated in fiat?
Also why is the forgot password feature at  broken? I have tried changing my password quite a few times in the past years but it just never works. The email will arrive at my gmail account a few days later instead of instantly.
