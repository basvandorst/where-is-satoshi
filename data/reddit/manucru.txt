Thanks for posting your experience.  I looked into BitcoinIRA also and was turned off by its 15% fee.  Great to hear the rate is negotiable.
This is an important topic as some would like to move their pension into an IRA that accepts Bitcoins, all without these exorbitant fees.  Hope competition drives the fees down.

You can also use Gemini's Active Trader.  It's like Coinbase Pro, but you can deposit and trade immediately.  Advantage is you don't have to wait a week for deposit to clear and can trade immediately.  However, you cannot withdraw your coins until deposit is cleared.
I had Coinbase Pro, and now just migrated over to Gemini.
