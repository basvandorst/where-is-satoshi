I've not tried them yet but the delivery seems similar to Tesco for groceries. I do intend to try them once I've got enough bitcoin to make it worthwhile.
EDIT: the prices for Tesco stuff seems almost exactly the same based on the conversion rate returned by this site:

Thanks for the extra information. I had less than £25 in the original grocery order I was considering, so that explains the larger charge. I'd consider ordering a larger grocery order once I have more Bitcoins.

I contacted them to say even though I wasn't in the position to book with them now if they did accept Bitcoin it would sway me to book with them vs someone else who did not accept it.

I just checked out Gyft, doesn't seem to be any UK giftcards at this time.
There is a dropdown for country though that currently only has United States on it. So maybe the website is ready for adding other countries at some point.

I thought it's generally considers good advice to never say anything directly to the police, only through a lawyer. I do think in this case the police probably would have been reasonable, but you never know.
He definitely shouldn't have used his personal account though, it's not the first time this has caused problems.

He tried using a credit card initially but the pizza sites in the US wouldn't accept his UK credit card for some reason. That's when he resorted to Bitcoin.
