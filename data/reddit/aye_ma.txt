I seriously hope nobody cares! I obviously got someone else to care though. It means a lot to have ones Reddit profile scrutinized.

I don't like wasting my time playing detective on people unlike whatever that person's name is... I'd much rather assume and be incorrect. So no, it doesn't really hurt to be incorrect. I believe you should feel that way also by BTCs current price? Can't always be correct bro :)

Quite the opposite my guy. Never bought into it, and don't plan on it in the near future. I'm content with my annual 40% stock return. It's not very chivalrous of you to channel your BTC losses frustration on someone else. Or am I making a false assumption about someone on the internet just as you did for me? Lol

With the amount of unecessary name calling, I'm going to ASSume, with high ASS confidence, that you're not :D
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:15:43
Obviously you haven't made a 40% BTC return or else you wouldn't have commented in such a way. Not really trolling if OP said this isn't a serious thread, so you and your diehard BTC fan club peeps are the ones who turned it serious.

The insignificant ones are those who threw their money into the dump and continue to convince themselves they're gonna buy their toy lambos next week.
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:03:55
*sigh*.. And the friend calls in for help and here comes the swoop! If he wanted this to end, he could've, again, grown up, and told me himself... Guy seriously needs a reality check.

WHOOOOA THATS CRAZY CAN U SHOW ME HOW I WANNA KNOW. No I don't. Its not like I already do....

"You ASSume more than you should"
Keep that smile on your face though. Its gonna do you great things in life buddy :D:D
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:05:04
ASSume an ASSumption? You're starting to lose me kid. :D

I'm on the other side here laughing as hard with you, almost feeling sorry. You sure like to stalk, but you sure don't know how to do it well... I challenge you to dig through more of my comments to find my income and find my return on investments through those beloved stocks. I, on the other hand, don't care about your social media profile and don't dare wasting time on it. I can't believe someone as old as you can again, act so immature. Grow up!!!
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:58:39
"Youre out of your league with me." Inflated ego much? Grow up.

I love love love this! Triggered yet another worthless BTCer to go through ends meet to prove something that means absolutely nothing. I applaud how much time you have to waste, but like you said, I am no one. You don't know who I am and what I use this profile for. So yeah, you can assume I'm a student with no income, but only an idiot would put ones true personal info, especially finances out there online. You keep playing that idea into your mind and get some satisfaction out of it. At the end of the day and referencing to my very first reply, it's so sad you have to go through people's profile to make a useless point. Its immature and petty, I don't know how many times I have to tell you, but grow up!
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:33:01
If I am no one, which is very true online, then that means OPs post doesn't mean much either. However, you sure love to stalk nobodies and care so much about their personal issues. As a teacher talking to a student (YOU), grow up. Please.

"I'm a retired professional forex trader"
Oh hey there btc-forextrader. The odds of such a coincidence are little to none. You two of all people should know a little bit of probability yeah?
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:23:00
If I haven't hinted it already and if you're mentally inept to understand, grow up. I advise you reread what you previously wrote and think about your behavior.
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:09:45
I can't believe you're such a die-hard BTC fanboy that you have the audacity of stalking a redditors profile. Worse, putting ones personal issues on full blast through another post. Who do you think you are that warrants such behavior? You and your BTC community should be ashamed.
@_date: 2018-08-01 07:32:35
That is correct.
@_date: 2018-08-01 00:01:50
Laughing at all of the idiots who put money into his bullshit
