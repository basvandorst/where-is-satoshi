Dodging a bullet if you ask me...

Yeah the parabolic downward curve price action since late Oct is an extremely good technical signal.

Usually a good contrarian indicator. When I start openly trolling. Bottom must be close.

Quality of posts going downhill fast.

I like how you have, like so so many before you, used gold coins to represent bitcoin. That always makes me happy. But I think to be more accurate you should change the gold with a B icon to the Excel spreadsheet icon.

How dumb do you think people are? Quality of posts here are going downhill fast. I dont want to be rude but thats really saying something.

Buy Bitcoin...and then sell it all Dec 2017. No position after that.
@_date: 2019-11-27 10:51:49
Ok. Bitcoin goes to $1 billion tomorrow. It still cant be used for anything but you can trade 1 bitcoin for a billion fithly fiat.
I guarantee you will sell.

Why not just cut to the chase and create a crypto that has only one coin. Then it will be instantly infinitely valuable.
@_date: 2019-11-25 10:32:37
Go all in. There is no way it could go lower from here.

Chinese miners say you buy now. Or at the very least hodl. Because if you dont then the price will really start falling. Such a huge responsibility. Do the honourable thing and salute as the water takes you.

I find it amusing that the price always seems to hang around round numbers. Except since late Oct where we see the parabolic breakdown.

Exactly. The US dollar is ultimately backed by this. [
And anyone or anything that threatens the US dollar will find themselves on the wrong side of it.

And a bunch of these...[

I would love to tell you what happens in the future but that will change the future, I forgot about that before I went time travelling.

With gold at 3k silver should 5-10x.
Might be worth rotating to silver for a while?? Or is bitcoin always the best place to be?
Always? Allllllllwwwaaayyysss?

I bet they prefer cash.......the fools.

Fractional reserve bitcoin loans? How? The supply is limited by design.
And if someone did devise a way to make fractional reserve bitcoin loans out of thin air (just like fiat) the whales would be the central authority. They would be the new Rothschilds with control over credit availability and could create bubbles and pop them at will.
Bitcoin as a currency would be heavily, profoundly deflationary, at least until all asset prices had revalued to the new very "hard money" system. Risk of a new dark age in that transition period would be very high. For bitcoin to become the preeminent currency, you're wishing for a dark age.
Bitcoin overlord/propaganda types know this, which is why its been repositioned as "the new gold". The test of its new stated use case will be during a world shaking crash where digital/paper asset prices are obliterated, where peoples faith in the stability of modern civilisation is broken and confidence is painful memory of the "good old days", whether people will be able to trust anything that is ethereal again for decades.
