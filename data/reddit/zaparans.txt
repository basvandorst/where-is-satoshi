You don’t seem to understand any of this. Growth can come from underconsumption. That growth comes from investment and not treating this like a currency.?

You posted a study on the Great Depression. 
I don’t object at all to what the study says. I’m speaking broader. I’ve worked for the imf and the fed. That’s not a statement of support for either entity but I’m familiar with monetary policy and currency. 
I don’t need a big study to make the point that a medium of exchange that increases in value is a poor currency. I’m not sitting at my computer on my jstor account. They are fundamentally opposed to each other and it’s not a point of contention. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:00:24

Sorry. You are right. Crypto is nothing like banks. It can’t do 90% of the stuff banks do. It doesn’t work as a currency. It’s only a speculative store of wealth like gold. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 16:58:03

There are far more bad actors in crypto than banking. 
It’s not hard to quantify. It’s a fact that banks have freed more people than crypto has.

Banks have been foundational to the economic development that has lifted millions out of poverty. I have no idea why you think giving away free money net and interest free loans are the way people get out of poverty. Sounds like some socialist silliness

Our banking system has been one of the most amazing Innovations in human history helping raise hundreds of millions of people out of poverty. Banks will also benefit greatly from crypto. They aren’t perfect and mistakes of been made and they have flaws but on the whole they have been exceptional And they will continue to play a vital role in economic development and growing prosperity.

It’s just historically accurate and continues to be accurate today. The shittiest countries don’t have basic banking. Banking gives flexibility to billions across the globe

@_date: 2018-05-08 03:56:45
A deflationary product will never ever be a good currency. A deflationary product theoretically goes up in value so spending it costs you gains. Btc will never ever be a currency in any significant form. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:34:28
I bet you are an anti vaxxer who hates GMOs
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:23:39
Ultimately btc is deflationary. Fair point that it may take a while though now body knows how much btc is lost in dead wallets or the ether. 
A “currency” that is consistently appreciating is not a good currency as it discourages spending it which is the point of currency. 
Btc can be hugely successful as a store of value. It doesn’t make sense as a currency unless we see some drastic leveling off of the volatility and the long term uptrend in value and frankly I like it moving up in value. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 12:51:35
There are tons of banks. There will always be some bad actors just like in crypto. BCash, bconnect, etc. 
It’s just silly to look at one bank and judge all banks by it.

@_date: 2018-05-16 22:38:31
It’s only chance is a store of value. Deflationary currency is contradictory and will never work.

What is a bitcoin exchange? I’m unfamiliar with exclusive bitcoin exchanges and unaware of any making big money. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:36:25
There are infinite alternatives to fiat. They just suck
@_date: 2018-05-17 12:50:50
No. Because they don’t work. They are inherently flawed. The purpose of currency is spending it but if it will be worth more tomorrow you don’t spend it. 
Btc can be a store of wealth but it will never be a currency due to this basic fact. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 14:55:49
That’s why you don’t hold fiat. 
It doesn’t change the fact that fundamentally deflation and Currency don’t mix. Deflation is completely at odds with every fundamental aspect of what currency is

Oh bah. Stop the banking FUD. There are bad actors in every sphere. Wells Fargo paid for their crimes and the banking crisis was entirely made by retarded us policy to put people who can’t afford homes into homes. Banks have done more to grow the middle class and increase prosperity than damn near anything. Central banks are entirely different than banks.
Banking was the original crypto. Before banks you had to suck the dick if a king for money and hope he didn’t slit your throat.

Yes I am aware that you could have an inflationary crypto. It would certainly be a better currency than a deflationary one

Never in the history of the world has a deflationary currency worked. Btc is a fine store of value and speculative asset. Banking on bitcoin aren’t the same thing so your analogy sucks. A better analogy would be bitcoin being Blockbuster and one of the new alts being Netflix.

You posted a study with very little historical data that focused on the Great Depression. The link shows no actual data at all outside unsubstantiated charts and it’s whole premise insinuates data that researchers know is limited and sketchy. 
This is a basic human issue. If you can buy two beers tomorrow with your currency would you buy one beer today? You would do everything to hold onto your currency today and that makes it a bad currency. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 23:54:27
I’m well read on the depression. If you have something that appreciates in value you are far less likely to spend it. This is a very basic tenet of human behavior.

Deflationary currency has the same pitfalls if fiat isn’t involved at all. Why buy one galling if milk today when you can buy two for the same btc tomorrow. 
Also employers will find a way to adjust your salary for deflation. They can’t keep paying you the same nominal amount of btc while it’s value climbs.

Nothing inaccurate with what you are saying but as I mentioned in the first post there are positives and negatives to this. “Mindless consumerism” is a massive driver of jobs. Those without jobs or the ability to save would be hit harder in a deflationary system.
