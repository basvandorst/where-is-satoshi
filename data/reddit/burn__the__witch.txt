My favorite piece from the article: “The bitcoin founder should be horrified seeing it rise so quickly, as any serious focus on it and its recent explosive move higher will soon end its freedom,” said John Taylor Jr, president and founder of research firm Taylor Global Vision in New York.

Haha! Alright, alright... you win. I don't have the energy to reread that twice.

This can only be sad if you chose to hold on at this point. You need to learn about purchase averages and the power of decrease in market cap and share price.

What percentage of circulating supply does he/she own?

It's nice to drink coffee out of a cup with a handle. That's the only hint I'm giving you.

I think people are underestimating the power of the strict investors, who don't mine at all, and the damage that can do to market cap/eps/price per share. Bitcoin has turned into an amazing investment opportunity with way higher price volatility due to its decentralization. 
We are going to see the price fluctuate at or around $2000 for a little bit as people think that this is a great opportunity to buy. They will quickly learn that fear of loss of value, uncertainty about the future of ABC/Segwit, and the deposit/withdrawal delays are going to sink the price per share well below $2000 and in return that fear will prove to a high volume sell off. 
I'm really looking for an explanation as to why holding on though this uncertainty is worth more than selling now and buying in again at a lower price.

I think you are one of the few who understands that not only is real money at stake here, but so is the reputation of bitcoin. If it splits, decentralization has been proven to be uncontrollable by the community that support it and that blockchain backed by centralized bodies are the only proper investments. 
The biggest money in the world is about to enter the arena and nothing helps their cause more than the collapse of bitcoin.

I really feel like at this point in Bitcoin, you need a basic investors understanding of markets and definitions. It is a dangerous game to play by having little to no financial understanding and purely buying in because of rhetoric or ideology.

There are plenty of classic investing books available. The problem with the older stock investment "bibles" is that they are pre-algorithm technology and a lot of the standard laws and practices have been debunked by computers at this point. Cross reference anything you read with sites like investopedia (investing for dummies, basically). The only way to learn is to make mistakes but I think it's a dangerous game to learn with big money on highly volatile investments like bitcoin. 
My prediction of the coming storm: Professional investors are going to enter the world of crypto-currency and chokeslam most people who are here now. The mistakes I am currently seeing people make is horrifying because crypto-currency has attracted a lot of people new to investing. Whether you are an active member of the mining community or not, this is purely speculating and investing.

Using your op powers to highlight your own political rhetoric, yawn.

Yeah this is far from being settled...
