As long as energy consumption is directly linked to global environmental changes, it will be a problem. The advantages of privacy/decentralization/whatever Bitcoin offers with its PoW algorithm doesn't worth its environmental impact. It could have been better if there were ways of protection from industry-scale centralized mining (e.g. China), but unfortunately Bitcoin doesn't provide that for now.

Hmm, very strange then. They generally refer to "late 2017" in their article, so maybe they accidentally or intentionally bumped old article.

I hope that this comparison now makes sense to everyone who were laughing at it just 10 days ago :)

Surely bitcoin is a bubble, but not in a traditional way. It's more like "iterational" bubble, better described here: 
Unfortunately, many people here can't recognize bubble pattern currently happening, obscured by "hodl", "I've seen it before, it happens all the time", "you are moron" etc. This is a bit delusional. People must understand they deal with highly speculative and manipulated asset, and a lot more time should pass before it becomes stable. Wild market must become mature, some rules must be estabilished, people must stop putting their whole life savings into crypto, carelessly dreaming of lambos. When it will all happen, then it will become stable.

Partially, yes. I'd say the problem fully resolves itself if along with switching to renewable sources, certain progress will be made in mining hardware technology, e.g. quantum computing etc., but it's a long shot.
Unfortunately, right now Bitcoin network is primarily powered by coal (source:

Price should return to at least 7-8k, worst-case is maybe 1.5-2k (prior to Nov-Dec bubble). It's completely healthy, cause such growth is unsustainable in long term. I'm really sorry for guys who bought at 9-19k, I bought at 9k myself but cashed out at 17k, when bubble started to fail.
I don't think it's strictly "redux" of 2013, cause the reason for 2013-14 crash was Mt. Gox problems, and currently there are no such major issues present. Even in case there will be bad news like trading or mining bans, decline will just speed up, but I don't think we'll see prices below 1.5-2k again.

Given that whole Bitcoin network consumes same amount of energy as Ireland or Belarus daily, and single transaction consumes same amount of energy as boiling 1000 full kettles of cold water... Yes, it is a huge problem indeed.

I tried to buy back two times with past year profit when it was at 6k and then at 5k expecting rebound, but quickly sold when I saw next dip is coming. I lost around 250$, after that I stopped trying and cashed out, but still retained major part of profit. The lesson here is - don't try to "buy the dip" and "hodl" unless you're 100% sure what's happening in the market. When you're 100% sure next bull run is coming, then slowly start to buy back.

Kraken is now A LOT better after recent maintenance that frightened people out. No more 5xx error messages, no errors when placing orders. Too pity they still haven't enabled stop loss orders.
