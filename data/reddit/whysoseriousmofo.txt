Oh..and presumably I can move the bitcoins direct from local bitcoins to say something like Bittrex etc right?

Ya. I'm keeping a close eye on things. Wondered whether to go in today or tomorrow!.

Thanks. I have already made a deposit yesterday (swift) not sure if it was Sepa as it was from GBP to USD. Last time the same thing took 7 days. :(

Nice one. Will look at the prices people are selling there for. May go to Coinbase instead depending on the price.

This is essentially how it will always have to work from what I can see. The premise that we can make do without FIAT and the banks seems hard to fathom at the moment (this has been popularised alot by many). Let's take an example. If some guy in Africa has found an old car that he thinks has value. How would he go about putting a value on it in BTC, given BTC is trading at a stable $10,000/1 BTC. He will always have to refer to prices in $/€/¥/£ or local currency to gauge the value, in absence of historic prices. It would be impossible for him to say I want 2 BTC for it, when someone somewhere is selling similar for $15,000. All else being equal, he can only ask for 1.5 BTC. He is forced to refer to FIAT values. This would just perpetuate FIAT use, I cant see BTC replacing it.
This would result in BTC simply being another currency (albeit a secure electronic currency), but not a system that replaces FIAT. Am I missing something?..

Totally agree. I think bitcoin will be cumbersome for large volume transactions..what about Litecoin? I can see this being proliferate more.. It will be interesting to see how IOTA disrupts this space..

$2??.. Dude.. If it falls to that, everyone would be too scared to put anything in and wait for it to go to $0.50.. But yes.. Good suggestion..

I better get some ripple in my portfolio.. I'm not the biggest believer of it, but I've noticed it's getting more publicity..
