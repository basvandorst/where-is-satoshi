Do you mean if you're a reserve currency, then as long your currency has demand you can print money and then you just have to worry about inflation because you're overspending? Taxes do slow down the velocity of money, so it's one method of controlling inflation, but it's not the sole reason for taxes. Also, it's important to have deals like OPEC and SWIFT and to have an economy that produces things other countries want to trade for to keep that reserve currency status and demand for your currency, but if you're funding your country through printing, you dilute the value of each dollar, which then causes foreign savers of your dollars to want to dump them. This then erodes the currency's reputation, and people will question its reserve status and not keep savings in that currency, which would increase inflation.

Banks pay money to guard your money and provide services such as checks, atms, etc. If they're not making enough money off of your money, then they need to charge for the service they're providing you.
You could consider inflation as a tax on your wealth though, but this is definitely not.
edit: After reading some comments down the line, interest rates are different and not the same as a service fee as there's a lot more involved, but this is definitely not a tax. And if reserve banks are charging negative interest, it means we're all probably in trouble.

It's a service fee, not a tax.
