Happy Tuesday!

I don't know if I can help you with external integration with your system but I'd be happy to help you take credit cards and bitcoin on your website. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 23:46:33
It's looking that way.

So how do I prevent myself from seeing their split key part while still maintaining offline and still being able to release cold storage in timely manner? 
@_date: 2013-03-17 05:43:06
Why can't we have a bet pool to get to 200 btc and then to martingale until have 240. Try simulation lol.

What..? I've been in web for more than 5 years.... Mobile for 2.

On phone so that's why it's vague when I get back to computer I'll give you a run through.
Edit: Okay so, I just wrote a long answer to this question and rudely Chrome lost it so here comes attempt two. 
In order to securely process credit cards transactions we turn to our PCI compliant processor Stripe you can learn more about their security system here:  We find that's a better solution as we would primarily like to focus on bitcoin security as it's surprisingly lacking In today's exchanges. 
So bitcoin security: My favorite subject, the first step of course is that we encrypt our wallets as is the standard but we also go a few steps more. For instance we also allow merchants to have their Bitcoins transferred to their own wallet instantly as it comes in. This method means that you will not lose all your coins from a server hack. The second feature we have is our dynamic cold storage. Merchants with high volume of bitcoin or anyone with an account can opt to put a percentage or a certain amount of bitcoin in cold storage however if your account has over a certain yet to be determined amount the cold storage will be mandatory for the sake of the service. This storage is completely secure and only one person in the world holds the encryption key in their head. One other copy of the cold storage wallet is stored in a safety deposit box also encrypted with a separate key known by a second trusted person in case of my death (please no). Users can schedule release of a certain amount of bitcoin from cold storage and the billing department will release on that day for immediate withdrawal or automated forwarding to a specified bitcoin address. This is to give the rightful owner a way to abort the cold storage release as they get notified via email (and sms potentially) when the release is scheduled. However the maximum withdrawal amount is available.
Exchanging to USD is handled by Mt.Gox, we don’t mean to get into the exchange buisness so we therefore just handle placing orders on the merchant's behalf. 
The advantage of our service is that with five lines of code (unless you want to do some fancy stuff with our API) you can add credit-card and bitcoin purchasing options to your website. Another advantage to our service is anonymity, the merchant is not told any information as to which bitcoin address sent the payment in, they simply know how much was sent to them, they are not told the receiving address either. Therefore they cannot link your identity to your bitcoin address. 
That’s just some of the ideas I have been planning (and most of them are implemented or close to it) The one problem we're having is how to efficiently handle USD withdrawals as it’s not really automatable. 
Thanks for the questions

We're debating between python, and nodejs.  Edit: I'm not associated with anyone else and we're not a python shop

But with the cold storage completely offline couldn't I just like.... take my friends key-part and still run away with it anyway lol. Why would you (the customers) trust "my" friends more then just me? They could technically kill me off and use their keys to simply send themselves all the others. Plus having to get a friend everytime I want to release some funds to the rightful owner would take significantly longer to release... The private key will be on the cloud storage computer and the safety deposit box only.

Can't do it. You can do charge backs months in the future.. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 15:29:38
Make it update bitcoin prices the moment it changes to keep it at the same USD price. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:44:10
Well we can build features after but basic posting would take less than a week definitely 
@_date: 2013-11-18 04:57:56
For 7000 bitcoin I would have had this site up in a week custom built. I'm a web developer and it's very annoying that this guy is not using the money. Someone have him contact me. 
@_date: 2013-03-11 14:40:22
If you want me to realtime your site i'll do for 2 bitcoin ;). Not kidding either.

I'm more of a node.js guy nowadays as I love the rapid prototyping of it. I honestly don't understand how this project could take months to hire.
