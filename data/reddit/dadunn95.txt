ok good, so why the hate against the bitcoin cash folk ? They are just offering an alternative client and competing aggressively. The core devs don't own the bitcoin brand.

what have they lied about and how have they cheated ?

bcash's block size is too big and allows fees to be low which increases throughput of the network and discourages the use of the lightning network

Nice, I downloaded your book, I've been trying to learn about blockchain programming but it isn't really easy to find good stuff. I'm a college student just getting started and I want to get into the bitcoin industry. Thanks again for making this book, although I'm more of a Java/C++ guy, I'm sure this book will help !

@_date: 2017-12-20 03:38:00

the price is probably going to drop more given the economic data making people believe that the fed is going to raise rates.
