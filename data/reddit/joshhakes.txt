Cool!  Any chance we can get a Windows 10 version?

This article tells me that they are working on Lightning but it doesn't tell me if their version depends on SW being activated.  It's my understanding that Lightning is *waiting* on SW to be activated before we will begin seeing it in wallets.

Strategically speaking it might be better to do lightning without it first but what do I know; I wish I could code :(

100% lie.

Human must consume therefore spending must happen so there wouldn't be a grind to a halt. The discussion is the change in spending one way over another.

I would like to set a maximum amount uploaded per day for listening usage, how do I do that?
@_date: 2017-09-07 16:51:06
keep in mind too that the savings will likely be invested which is great.
EDIT: a word

Where can I find bitcoin.conf?  I looked in C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin but I don't see it there.

User Activated Soft Fork Please!
@_date: 2017-05-02 19:19:17
OK cool did that.  Is there a way to verify I've done it correctly like from an outsider's perspective?
@_date: 2017-05-08 23:52:00
Yes and my node is indicating support for BIP 148 in addition to BIP 149.

The potency gets higher with interdiction efforts.

Is there a way to see my old account activity on the Mt. Gox exchange?
@_date: 2017-06-21 18:58:07
I know right, so let's get segwit and lightning going!
