Actually the conversion of Base2048 to WIF is detailed in BIP32 (deterministic HD wallets).  It's not a direct conversion as there is quite a process when working with BIP32 wallets.
@_date: 2016-08-27 19:50:19
Another important difference is that BIP32 wallets (generated from BIP39 keys in Mycellium) consist of many wallets, and they're not directly correlated.  There is no way to convert directly from Base2048 to WIF because that's not how it works.  Go look at the BIP32 spec to understand how keys are generated from a Master Private Key (seed).

Fair, but it doesn't even make that big of difference in privacy.
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:41:28
Wow that was a waste of my time.  The points in it, while valid in theory, are so incredibly weak that it pains me to read.  For example, moving bitcoins off the main chain isn't a flaw or reason not to invest; it's just one small possible advancement. This is just an extreme joke.  There are valid reasons, but not many are listed in this document. 
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:05:58
After the network reaches 75%, I suspect that easily another 15% will change over because there's a two week changeover period.
The reason they chose 75% was so that a single pool couldn't decide that they don't like the block size increase, and then simple not upgrade (because we all know that there's going to be one or two pools that are total assholes about it).
@_date: 2015-06-05 03:42:10
I don't think it's bad practice to use a single address for one employer.  I know that there's all these "perfect world" situations, but as soon as you give them a whole xpub, they've now got information about all your transactions...what's that you were saying about privacy...
If you give them a single address, it's easy and nearly impossible to fuck up.  This is how I manage my mining.  Everything I mine from one pool goes in address A, and other pool into address B (and I can easily manage addresses like that).
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:50:29
Not if the person isn't trying to be anonymous.  Using just standard Bitcoin 1.0 software to send money around, if I know which all the change addresses are, I can start to figure things out.  Say I hack an electrum server (I mean run my own and analyze it) to get a list of IPs associated with each address, then I can start to locate where these addresses come from.  Oh that's interesting that neighbour 1 paid neighbour 2 $100k, I'd be interested in finding out what they're hiding.  Now neighbour 2 is sending most of that money to some address in Cuba.  I can now see that neighbour 1 and Cuba may be related.  
Obviously this all goes with tremendous assumptions, *but* it does allow for another layer of investigation, above a physical layer (like actually spying on neighbor 1 and 2).

Well no shit, that's not what's in question.  It's whether an attacker can take over the network by owning 99% of the full nodes.

Theoretically, if he has 1/3 of the bitcoins, in strictly economic terms (and disregarding the lack of trust in the system that would result) the price would fall by 1/3 (so 2/3 of what it is now).
@_date: 2015-06-19 21:21:12
You're an idiot.  If 1 node is still good, then all the other nodes will go after the **longest valid blockchain**, which is the blockchain that the single node has.  As such, everyone will reject the attacker's block chain.  This is the magic of bitcoin, and clearly something you don't understand.
@_date: 2015-06-23 16:02:30
This happens all the time, there just has to be a single node that sees it and it will get propagated eventually, as long as the outputs of your transaction were 0.01 or bigger (just my experience).

I disagree.  I think that the way change is made, especially with things like this, is my bringing the issue forward.  This is an easy-to-solve issue, and if enough people get mad at that guy, then change will happen.

Do you know what the WIF-format private key is?
@_date: 2015-06-17 16:31:08
 provides a better option (around 3% per year), and it's been around longer and is probably more trustworthy.  I keep a decent chunk with them and make quite a bit per year, so you might want to check it out as well.
@_date: 2015-12-19 05:37:10
In what way?
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:51:09
No, you misunderstand this.  There is a hard limit that is set by the network.  Miners and nodes can't arbitrarily choose their own hard limit, because that causes a million forks to surface.  The thing you call a "soft limit" is actually the generation limit.  A soft limit means that the limit is dynamic and can be changed based on what miners want with either a voting system or something of the type.
@_date: 2015-06-29 19:20:51

In GitHub, there are over 8000 commits (I think...not 100% sure on that number).  Just go back to around the first commits (I think it's between 0.1 and 0.3), and you can see the original code, and how Gavin and the team wrote the code (when I say re-wrote, I mean went though, change variable names, fixed spacing, tested smaller parts, etc.) so that it's way prettier and accessible. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:45:07
Keep up the good work.  The bitcoin world needs more people like you!
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:07:29
Good for you, that's completely irrelevant now.
Now imagine a malicious person wants to fuck with bitcoin.  He mines a 10GB block, and then broadcasts it.  This is in the future where internet speeds are fast, and it doesn't take long to propagate (like 20 seconds to get to 50% of the nodes).  Also, there's no block limit.  Now the network has to store 10GB of useless data all because there was no block limit.
@_date: 2015-06-10 23:55:47
OP_RETURN and  are two things to look at 
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:57:33
Nope, not even close.  The pool operator gets to make the decisions within the configuration of their bitcoin core.  Has nothing to do with your miner alone because **you don't mine blocks, pools do!**
@_date: 2015-06-04 03:21:58
I like this, and I want to run this again in a year (when the block size change would actually take place).  A graph like this shows the increase and why we're going to need a blocksize increase.  Just because we're at 400k blocks today doesn't mean that we won't need more in the future (when the actual change over happens).
Another thing to point out is that taking out all those things you mentioned is useless.  They're going to be included in the blocks and therefore must be considered. 
@_date: 2015-06-29 20:25:16
The blockchain would be worthless if SHA256 broke though

Um not, we're talking about address collisions
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:34:57
Completely fair, yes
@_date: 2015-06-07 20:05:29
I don't think you understand how the protocol works.  They would have to pay **every single node that receives that block.**
With mining, you're only paying the person who mines the block.  If you're talking about propagation, you have to pay every single person who receives the block.  And every single person who will ever run a full node in the future of bitcoin.  I think your idea is pretty damn flawed.
@_date: 2015-06-11 02:41:29
It really is a great design.  I'm so glad they managed to figure out something like it to implement across the mining side of things.
@_date: 2015-06-04 16:43:00
Agreed, but the block size increase and whether or not they pay their fees are pretty unrelated.

Stay away from RoboCoin, they scammed a few people pretty good (makes me cry)
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:31:48
Um no, that's not an address collision at all.  An address collision is where two different private keys make the same address/public key.  Using the same private key will obviously make the same public key.  Therefore, this is not an example.
@_date: 2015-06-03 23:20:00
If the private key is empty, could you just post it here so that we can verify the setup?

Switch to Electrum and take control of your money.  It's an overall better system, and is way easier to use.
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:47:31
There will always need to be a block limit because someone could easily do a DoS attack where a miner makes a 2GB block, and then the rest of the network is too busy catching up and nobody can store the block and the network breaks.
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:40:16

What percentage of transactions are multisig?  What percent are mixed?  What percent are 1000-person-payments offchain?  I totally get what you're laying down, but I still think there's merit in it, such as checking for quality of mixing.  If it's a change output, that still shows that the owner could own both.  You can predict with a pretty good chance of being right in a standard person-to-person transaction which is change and which is where the money is actually being transferred. I know there are flaws, but in terms of blockchain analysis, it's a rather easy and effective method of getting a grasp on relatedness.  Now just to figure out how to calculate it....
@_date: 2015-06-17 05:43:57
As I read this, I just have Andreas Antonopolis's voice in the back of my head reading this for no reason.

I'm with ya there!
@_date: 2015-06-11 23:47:52
I think it is entirely irrelevant because miners are giant now.  They have very smart programmers and SysAdmins, and will make the decision to change their generation size limit themselves.  I suspect that if they choose to go to the new fork, then they will support making bigger blocks.
I think that a way to solve this problem would be to include an API call (or at least add this option to the bitcoin.conf file), so that they can easily and dynamically change that max generation limit without hassle. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:30:50
What?  I don't get it.
@_date: 2015-06-02 16:28:56

I'd use Electrum if I were you.  It's really easy to view all the addresses and spend from them.
@_date: 2015-06-02 22:30:58
Electrum doesn't require you to waste time downloading the blockchain, etc.
It also has support for STANDARD HD wallet formats (and not stupid, proprietary ones like Armory).
It's super easy to get started, you can easily see all your addresses in a list without it freezing or taking forever to load.
The list goes on, but these are just a few of the reasons Electrum is better.
@_date: 2015-06-23 02:04:20
That's not how the bitcoin network works though. Once it's broadcast, it doesn't just disappear. It might take a while to propagate, but it still will. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:31:16
No, actually you can't.  It would be adding the same work to the chain, and therefore their chain would be just as long as yours.  I'm not totally sure what you're thinking here, but it doesn't get you anything whatsoever.  This whole thread is just beginners trying to figure out why bitcoin is secure.

No, because regardless the ASIC would be checking:

Blockchain.info can't require you to set up SSL on your site.  Callbacks will still work fine.

Good idea, although Armory isn't the way to go.  The number of Electrum users is way greater than Armory now.  Not only that, but Trezors (which fit perfectly with that transaction broadcasting idea you had) use the protocols that Electrum uses, and not the ones in Armory.

The description isn't totally accurate.  You're not buying and selling tokens.  The tokens (by which I assume you mean keys) are how you access the coins by signing transactions on the ledger.  You're not giving anyone your tokens.

No, it's a matter of consensus.  You can't just go recompile the bitcoin source code and change the block reward to 100 BTC and make yourself rich.  Of course that's how it's implemented, but **everything on a computer** is a matter of implementation following your logic.

Wow, love it!!!  As we have to start hosting full nodes on services like Amazon Cloud Services and other hosted server solutions, systems like this are exactly what we need.  Further development should include possible implementations of Electrum-like deterministic wallets (I know that has almost no relevance to the current system, and I'm not sure how it could be implemented, but I'm sure there's a way to integrate it in), as well as a GUI that nearly completely matches that of the Bitcoin-Qt for the more beginner-type people who want to start hosting their own full node.

Electrum is based largely on BIP32 and 39. Really, those are the two parts I'll be borrowing for the Trezor v2 code. Thanks for pointing those out, much appreciated.

It says that previous backups become useless.  Does this mean that all funds are sent to an encrypted change/hidden address (during encryption), and any funds after encryption that are sent to an unencrypted address can be stolen with an unencrypted backup?  Thanks for your amazing answer!
@_date: 2014-08-25 06:55:43
I'm a native Python coder...been doing it since I was 9.  I know tons of other languages, so it would likely be mostly porting the code.
I can't say for sure whether or not it has higher security, but it is really easy to use.  I like the 12-word mnemonic. I like the fact that it automatically finds your addresses based on the seed.  I like that it is easy to do a watch-only system with.  It's been proven that it's secure...it's more that it's for integrations into current software, instead of running a proprietary complete system, you could just run a basic electrum plugin (still brainstorming...nothing set in stone).
Thanks for the note about the Trezor, I hadn't heard of that, but it is something I'll look into.

As great as your idea is (and I do believe it is, you've really thought it through), I don't think people care a great deal about security so far.  They're more concerned about regulation, accessibility, etc.

And thank god it doesn't check if it's been used!  If I magically generate a lucky address that *has* been used, I'm stealing that money to go buy a lottery ticket.
I was just reading an interesting article recently about this, but point is even if we started randomly generating addresses since the start of the universe (14 billion years ago), at 100 thousand addresses per second, we'd only be a fraction of the way through the address space.  There are more addresses than there are atoms on Earth.  You can think of it lots of different ways, but point is that the odds of that happening are so remotely rare that it doesn't need to be considered.  Similar to how it's possible a grizzly bear is about to break through your window and kill you, but you don't think about that now do you?
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:12:19
I'm going to suggest something, don't know if it works but I think it should:
Go download Electrum 2.1.1 from   Create a new wallet, and then enter your seed.  I think it's possible that it will work.
If it's not working anyway, would you post the seed on here and maybe one of us will figure out what to do with it and send you back some of your coins...what've you got to lose.  
@_date: 2014-12-31 01:08:35
Yeah, I'm waiting for the trolls to show up.  It can determine this with 100% accuracy, obviously.  It might be from multiple addresses, but obviously it has to know where the transaction came from.  Otherwise that would defeat the purpose of transferring funds, obviously.
@_date: 2014-12-13 05:07:03
Alright, let me explain my dilemma.  I just looked at that page not 20 minutes ago, and as enlightening as it was, it didn't solve my problem.
So if you look at [this offer here (on the Trezor website)]( you can get a discount by mining on their pool.  However, I need to buy 2 Trezors, and I have a 140 GH/s miner.  I want to split that 140 GH/s between two accounts, each mining for 3 days straight so that I can purchase two Trezors, each under a different shopping cart, at the discounted rate (to save a total of $80).  
I don't think cgminer natively supports this, and that's why I asked about a possible proxy, forked/cloned proxy, or horribly/wonderfully modified proxy.  Thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-29 15:39:59
I was in the same place as you.  What you should do is download Electrum.  Electrum is the best client.  It's easy and simple, and backup are so incredibly easy.
What I did was I simply sent everything in my QT to Electrum.  Then, in QT, I exported the addresses, and then imported them into a blockchain.info account (which I know you don't want to do, but hear me out).  That's just in case I ever received anything from those addresses.  Blockchain.info makes importing and exporting addresses so much easier.  Then if you ever get transactions to those addresses, you can just send it all to your Electrum wallet.  If you don't count on ever receiving transactions to your old addresses, then you can just backup the wallet.dat file and take a look at it a year from now and make sure nothing new got into it.
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:23:16
That's weird, I can get into my account just fine.
@_date: 2014-12-13 18:35:46
What you're saying is going to split the work.  However, that's not what you need to get this discount twice.  You need to be mining (with any amount of work) for 3 days straight.  The balance strategy splits the time you're working on the different places in two.
Actually thinking it through, I'm going to stop fighting it because there's an increasing change you're correct.  Thank you for your help, I'm going to look into doing it your way...I think you're probably right.

It certainly has its place, can't argue that.  And it makes sense to have an online version of it, you're totally right.  Downloading and parsing the blockchain takes too long for the home computer, so it would make sense to create a server/online version.  I think there would be more widespread use of Electrum, however.

You shouldn't be so dependent on JS, because things start going really weird when an error occurs.  For example, loading the settings in a bitch on a slow internet connection and typically takes 2 or 3 tries once the password times out, etc.
Everything else though, it's just that their appearance is pretty horrible for a **million dollar platform**.  It's not absolutely horrible, but something like GreenAddress is pretty great (although their API is a bitch to get deployed quickly and with minimal effort).
On the other hand, Blockchain.info's API is so simple to use that anyone could do it, which makes it absolutely great.
@_date: 2015-05-27 04:26:27
Your point about miners having to wait and see if invalid.

4. Use  to trade for bitcoins into your blockchain.info wallet

I have looked at that (and have actually worked on a piece of code with a buddy for that competition, obviously didn't have any success).  That's for analyzing the English language for linguistic compression. 
In this case, it would be much more of a standard compression technique, more like a ZIP file where all "1" is mapped to aaaaa and all "2" is mapped to alskdkfls, etc (depending on how frequently the various pieces of text occur).

If I use my address 10 times, I see a way to shrink that pretty significantly.
I see what you're saying, but also the distribution isn't really completely random.  Also, how many people do you think have a balance of 0.01000000 (which is a bunch of bits [don't feel like doing that math right now]).  Imagine being able to shrink that bunch of bits (which is probably like a double float or something) into "reference common amount  (which is basically how compression works, obviously).  It seems like an interesting enough idea.

BitVC.com...with a little help from Google Translate.  I've used it for a little over six months, and've loved it.  They give currently 0.011839% per day, although that rate varies between 0.01 and 0.02%.  They also provide compound interest for Litecoin.
There are similar things with other exchanges such as Bitfinex, but there's a possibly that the person borrowing your money may never pay it back.  In my experience, as long as you have a reasonable trust in Chinese exchanges, this is the way to store bitcoins/litecoins if you want to earn compound interest.
@_date: 2015-05-09 14:43:44
That's so untrue.  It was designed so that it could only be changed upon consensus over the network.  Duh.  Satoshi himself even said the blocksize was only temporary, and that it eventually would need to be changed.

Yes I understand that, I was just pointing out the concept that nodes don't have any affect regarding confirmations and confirmation time.
The block confirmation time is 10 minutes on average.  The transaction confirmation time of acceptable-fee transactions is theoretically 5 minutes if you do a theoretical statistical analysis (but that's not the block confirmation time).  
The thing about hashes is that their distribution is random, so you can't guarantee that it would be a third of what it is today (although that's a waste of typing to discuss because we assume random distribution.

You work as a relay for forwarding the transactions.  Instead of making everything go through a single, laggy connection, you forward it all around.  You keep a record of the database so that it can't be destroyed, and you help sync new nodes up.  You are also just actively participating in the network.  Maybe someone else can give you a list of a few more things...
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:48:04
Yes, if there was consensus it could happen.  But they wouldn't make a change that big as it uselessly introduces a very big hard fork (vs a little hard fork that extends precision).

I am so glad you've finally published this and material progress is finally being made regarding this fundamental and imperative upgrade to this already amazing technology. Thanks for looking into the future and making a required change instead of playing catchup like technologies so often have to. To everyone who complains about how it takes extra storage, etc., they should not be hosting a full node. Anyone can get 3TB for under $200 (and it's only getting cheaper), and the blockchain is going to continue to grow like a weed regardless of this change. Thank you for your continued effort in this project, we all appreciate it!

It's possible that the next block is mined in 12 seconds even though the miner speed doesn't change.  It's really random, even though the mining speed changes the odds relative to the difficulty.  I'm just playing devil's advocate because theoretically and applied statistics can (but in this case, most likely won't).

Do not follow instructions that involve depositing to somewhere and then withdrawing or exchanging around for different coins.  While these work sometimes, blockchain analysts can often figure it out if there's enough incentive.  Plus, the exchange's "petty cash fund" might not be much greater than your deposit, so you get the same coins (I say this figuratively because they're really UTXO's and whatnot) back, which defeats the purpose.  Also a master wallet shows association, which is bad and doesn't really mix either.

The thing that holds it back is that they will implement it in an update, but that update will say:
    if current_date &gt; March 2016 (or other arbitrary date) then
        allow bigger blocks
    else
        don't allow bigger blocks
This is to allow people to update and not be left behind.  Imagine how much work it is to update a system like BCI or other mass service provider.  It can't be done in an hour like updating your home node.
@_date: 2015-05-04 04:31:48
I wish I had thought of that, that's actually a pretty clever scam.  Thank god it was only $20.
@_date: 2015-05-30 23:01:11
Nobody's provided a good explanation, so here it goes:
A miner decides he wants to ruin bitcoin.  In 100 years when interest speeds are 1 TB/s, he creates a 100 TB block.  This means that everyone needs to download that and store it.  Now everyone's pissed off and people give up.  He could have created a bigger one, just to spam the network.
Maybe speeds and storage stuff hasn't gone up that much.  It would be similar to someone (in today's time) creating a 10 GB block (because there's no max size after all), and making the network sluggish and making everyone download a big block that's useless.  I know I'd be pissed if they did that once a week (because that's all their little operation mines) for a year (that's 520 GB at the end of a year).  That becomes really hard to distribute, and really cost-ineffective to store (as well as slow for parsing purposes and whatnot). 
@_date: 2015-05-03 02:01:20
Could you publish the seed here if it's empty so that I could verify that?  If it is in fact empty, you have nothing to lose.

1 MB at 10 minute blocks is 6 MB per hour.
1 MB at 1 minute blocks is 60 MB per hour.
20 MB at 10 minute blocks is 120 MB per hour.
We'd therefore need to do them at 30 second blocks to get the equivalent as his proposal.

Thank you, although I'm having issues with the libgmp dependency.  Apparently homebrew installed Version 12, and I need Version 13.  How'd you install this?
@_date: 2015-05-28 02:44:12
This is actually effectively a "double-spender", which is a service that most companies wouldn't develop.  There's no way to "add" a fee to a tx, you can only submit a new tx with a fee that uses the same inputs and outputs as the old tx, but that's a double spend (and then which ever transaction is confirmed first wins).
That said, I could totally see Electrum makes a service like this that makes an act like this easier.  Go submit an issue request on their GitHub (PM me if you need help, it's really easy tho).
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:12:03
But not everyone is going to ignore it, and that's how forks happen. So they would have been successful in screwing with the network. You just kinda proved my point.

I bought mine about a year ago from OneMiner.com and got a ZeusMiner Thunder x6 (20 MH/s).
Your point about the price fluctuating because of hashrate is not really true.  There's many other factors that affect the price.
If you look at a graph of the bitcoin hashrate, it's very unpredictable.  1 week it's x, and the next week it's three times that.  And then it's that same value for the next year, and then a mining operation opens up and it jumps again.  With litecoin, it's pretty much a constant increase.
@_date: 2015-01-21 21:32:34
Stawp being smart!  Leave me with my happy thoughts of the world ending. :P
@_date: 2015-05-30 19:54:33
I use a 20 MH/s Scrypt (litecoin) miner.  That's the key.  There aren't giant mining operations opening up Scrypt data centers, so that means the difficulty is pretty constant.  I am currently making a profit with this little beast between BetaRigs and Westhash, and would never go back to SHA256 (bitcoin) mining.
@_date: 2015-05-03 01:31:32
We would never actually change the denomination.  We would never multiply by 100.  Ultimately what we could do was change it from 8 places to 32 places, and then use pico-bitcoins or less.  That's very possible.

In the future, use Electrum on an offline computer.  It's so much easier, and you can have multiple addresses.  You can also easily view the transactions on an online computer through the use of the Master Public Key.  Also, and I highly suggest this, get yourself a Trezor.

The bitcoin blockchain will be able to handle it, I promise.  It's not doing anything negative.  Plus, looks like I've had a total of 0 users try this.  If I get 5 in the next year, that's still um, 0.0000001% of the total transaction volume.  The blockchain is versatile, and therefore can be used for many things.  This is one of those things. I'm paying a 0.001 miner's fee for every transaction, so it's not like I'm crazily harming the network.

Well that's nice and interesting.  This would be how you make it appear you have more bitcoins than you do: send to yourself, and as long as they don't confirm (which these ones will in the next few hours), it appears you have both the received amount and the sent amount.  Very clever, although I doubt that's what they're doing.

I know I'm not going to become rich off of this, so the main reason that I created this project was to put in my portfolio.  Dealing with bitcoin transactions and callback and validation and whatnot takes a decent amount of coding, and it's something that looks good to employers.
Also, I make everything really easy.  Yes, someone could come along and do what I did (and make it free), but then people have to configure it to use their own wallets during the broadcast, and that's more difficult that what I've set up here.
A year in the future, I might open-source...this was just a fun little project.

It does not have anything to do with block confirmations.  It does not create more confirmations (either at the same or an accelerated rate).  Locally it validates the block before broadcasting them to other nodes, but they do not verify blocks like miners do.  That's a common misconception among people that needs to be stopped right away.

Make a free website, scam people out of $20, go buy a real domain name with Namecheap maybe, code up a quick website, and then start earning $100 with that.  I'd buy a gift card on Gyft, go eat, and then keep going.  Maybe start the next Silk Road :)

Yes sorry, you're right about the balance.  
My point still stands though: Person A send Person B "reference common amount  BTC
Some addresses that have thousands+ of transactions could be shrunk to "reference common address  instead of 25 bytes of data (because that's how long an address is).
Even better, it could totally be applied to Electrum.
@_date: 2015-05-02 17:36:55
I'd use Electrum if I were you.  Although really, you can trust most online service providers as long as you don't have more than a few bitcoins in their wallets.  The ease of using blockchain.info (well, their API...their GUI sucks) far outweighs the risks of losing bitcoins due to hacking.  Just have it so that it automatically sends to a cold storage wallet when the balance exceeds 5 BTC, and then you can manually refill it.

Trezor.  Just use a Trezor.  It totally fits the "easily access from any computer".  Well, maybe it's not quite as convenient as remembering it in your head, but what I do is store my saving on my Trezor, and keep a "live" Electrum wallet with about 0.4BTC in it at all times that I can use wherever.  It took about a week, but I memorized the seed (yes, I have it written down in like 10 other places under lock and key [and by 10 I mean 3]), and now I'm good to go if I show up at a library on the other side of the world and need $100 in bitcoin.  Otherwise, I use my Trezor for bigger purchases.

Electrum is the one to go with.  It allows you to go pretty much every direction.  If you want to be a noob, there's a list of addresses and you can click send to send (it's that simple).  If you want to be advanced and have 100 addresses with a memorized seed and 100 Bitcoins, you can easily create offline transactions, sign them, etc. with Electrum.  It really is the most open and easiest to use wallet.  PM me if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2015-08-08 02:38:01
People are going to scream at me for suggesting the use of Blockchain.info, but they have a neat project that's great for transferring funds: 
Import it, and then within 10 minutes use it to send to a new address in Electrum.  You can also use it to export the keys and import them into Electrum.
Don't do this if you have more than a few hundred bucks in bitcoin because Blockchain.info isn't to be trusted with large amounts, but they work pretty well for smaller amounts.

I figured I'd give it a shot, because I'd still be pretty profitable with it.  Anyway, as long as it's not a huge chunk of money for you, it's a pretty spectacular deal, so I'd give it a shot.
@_date: 2015-08-21 16:39:40
I think 5x what I should need to pay is quite a bit more than I should need to pay.
For less than $100ish, they'd just let you go for free.  Otherwise you get to wait 5ish minutes, and they use an XT node that can view double spends to make sure it's going to go through.  For a $1k purchase, they'd make you wait for longer.  I think 10 minute final completion is pretty quick compared to other payment methods (like Visa, obviously).
@_date: 2015-07-06 05:07:28
I don't understand the objective, could you make it a little more clear?
@_date: 2015-07-29 14:31:07
Virwox lets you buy $100ish per day, so that should be good. If you're looking for something simpler, use weselldoges.com and then shapeshift.io to trade for BTC 
Best of luck to ya! 
@_date: 2015-08-13 18:28:11
I guy what you're saying, but SPV wallets, electrum, etc. all follow a similar server-client scheme. You do not have to host a node (or electrum server) to be a user of bitcoin/electrum.

Still though, BrainWallets are awkward to use.  And they're only a single address.  Reusing addresses is bad for a number of reasons.  That's why an Electrum seed is superior.

It's not just mining the new transactions, it's verifying all previous ones.  When you spread that, transactions become very cheap.
@_date: 2015-07-21 01:09:25
RushWallet is better for this kind of thing
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:36:34
So you do not buy a node. You set one up on am existing PC. 
However, it isn't that important. You cannot influence the block size change (not even by running a node). Full nodes are important, but whether you run xt or core doesn't make a huge difference in the grand scheme of things as they both relay and store transactions and blocks (and yes, I know that there is a difference in how they do that, but it's effectively the same for everyone else [exception is if you're a merchant]).

Just learn to manage it by Bitcoin-CLI.  It is so much more secure, and it's really not that different.  Your other option is to go and use a different wallet.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:19:58
With something like bitcoin (and open source software in general), I can nearly guarantee that the same software will be available (can't say it'll be around in general use, but it will still be available) for as long as the modern internet survives.  That said, both Electrum and Mycelium are cross-compatible in terms of the wallet generation from seed (they use something called BIP32).  The information for that protocol is available online in the BIP32 Github page (just google around).  Your bitcoins will be safe for a while, it's more just a thing of whether they'll have any value (but I'm sitting here assuring myself they will).  A Trezor is another great option if you're looking to be spending and using a decently-large amount of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:52:59
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:00:27
Practically, no.  There is no risk.  Privacy is the only concern.  However, if someone does get just a single private key, then they could get all your private keys.  However, the only way they could get a single private key from your Trezor is to have your whole seed, in which case, they already have all your private keys.  So I'd say you're pretty much safe.  The pros far outweigh the cons/risks.

There was a time when you were guaranteed 10 minute confirmations (not technically guaranteed, but politically and practically guaranteed).  That time has left...having to wait an hour because you didn't send a giant fee to get above a spam attack because blocks are so small is not fast, and it's not consistent.
@_date: 2015-07-21 15:08:26
Plus if you're mixing the drug coins back to your personal wallet so you can exchange them, it doesn't really matter that they know the address is related to your IP address.  That's why it's not a huge deal if you're going from illegal-&gt;legal wallets (I'm assuming dealers keep two wallets for this purpose), you could use your normal IP address for the legal ones.

@_date: 2015-08-20 17:23:54
Couldn't agree more, it really is kind of a joke to say that you don't care about it when it's one of the underlying principles of bitcoin...obviously you'd have to have some care for it.
Plus, in 100 years when bitcoin takes over and there is no cash, the whole "I already have those" argument is kind of lost because you'll have to wait until you're 150 for a transaction to confirm.
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:47:50
It's not insecure to perform this check inside Tor, because all you're doing is saying "I'm curious what addresses with *coin* [don't tell me they're not real coins] is associated with".  They can't see what you're searching for because that's not how the internet works.  All BCI can see on their end is that you were curious what the address has been used with.  Not insecure whatsoever. 
@_date: 2015-07-23 15:09:26
Yes, although not directly.  Likely what you'll have to do (to use a block explorer online - all bitcoin transactions are public) is use a tool to convert the private key to a public key, and then the public key to the address (yes, public key and address are different; no, it does not matter because nobody ever looks at public keys, and commonly confuses the term for bitcoin address) [note that most tools like Electrum wouldn't display the public key for your - they go straight to the address].  Once you have the address you go to a block explorer like Blockchain.info, search for your address in their search bar, and then you can see all the *addresses* it's sent and received to and from.  You cannot see IP addresses, or those people's actual identities though (because bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous).
@_date: 2015-07-23 19:10:29
Or they get 20 BTC, and they'll generously give him back 2/3 of what it is.  Odds are that's the only way you'll get help eventually (and just hope that an honest person returns some).

No, there probably aren't any
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:09:48
I'd definitely do JoinMarket...it's really easy and great.  With 10+ bitcoins, you'll be rather successful probably, and make maybe 1% per month, so in 10 years, you'll more than double it (in theory).  Set it up securely on a Raspberry Pi though (that's what I do).  If you need any advice, let me know...I have a bunch of experience with it and will be able to help you get started.
Another option is to remain 100% risk free, and just stick it on a Trezor and leave it alone.
If you're looking to have a little fun, you can play with small amounts on ChainProfit.com, it's a fun website to test your luck with (and currently I'm in the black on it, so that's a plus).

Everyone's making fun at this question, but this is a legitimate question and one of the possible attacks on bitcoin (see wiki page on this).
As far as I know, nobody will enforce it although they have certainly encoded such data in the blockchain just for this purpose.  It is not a legitimate fear to have though because so many people have a copy, and you're not doing anything illegal with that content.

We do pay for it.  We don't pay for it in the general sense, but for "free" services like Gmail, you're being marketed to.  That generates revenue.  Without it, Google would make significantly less money.  Just because we are not physically giving them money doesn't mean it's free.  Also note that this is fact, and not some "government out to get us" conspiracy.
There are other reasons too.  Spam prevention and transaction prioritization.  Making mining cost effective, and allowing bitcoin to continue.  It is a fundamental thing to the currency.
So let's say InfinityCoin is created where coins are created forever with no halving (I feel like it probably exists).  Then what do you do when you have 100MB of TXs to fit into a 1MB block?  The currency dies unless there's a way to order them that filters out spam somehow.
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:11:39
The thing with bitcoin is that there is no master codebase for you to analyze.  You could argue that it's the Bitcoin Core code that needs review (and the answer is yes, it has been reviewed and *completely rewritten* by the developers compared to what Satoshi wrote).  It's also been reviewed when other parties created the Java and JS ports of the code.
@_date: 2015-04-26 03:00:41
If you're being fraudulent, then it is.  However, merchants shouldn't accept payments until they've received a confirmation or two as that's the single most important thing to verify with bitcoin.

Can you explain what it is?
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:00:13
Electrum supports the standards for HD wallets, Armory has its own system (unless that's changed recently).
No, there is no IP address association.  That's only if you're using the bitcoin core (which can't really be done over Tor anyway).
Yes, Electrum sends your BTC addresses to the server.  No, this is not a bug, that's how it gets the balance of your addresses.  If you're really concerned, just set it up to go through Tor (it's really easy to configure a SOCKS[5] proxy within Electrum), although this is not necessary because quite honestly nobody cares and no server is logging all that information.  But just in case you do care, that's the easiest solution.
Remember that this is all about privacy, not security.  From a security perspective, it doesn't matter if they have your addresses (both IP and BTC).
For cold storage, I recommend a Trezor 100%.  PM me if you want a coupon.
I'm begging you right now to stop using Bitcoin Core (bitcoin-qt).  It is not helping yourself.  You should switch to Electrum and/or Trezor today.  Electrum is really easy to use, and allows easy creation of both hot and cold wallets.
Electrum is way easier to use than Armory.  I personally hate Armory because it's just a lot of work for gaining you almost absolutely nothing about Electrum.

As for the rest of the calculation, see here: 
Of course you'll need a little bit of extra math (time per 25 BTC to BTC per day...I'm sure you can figure it out with proportions and stuff from eighth grade math).

I agree mostly.  However, no other cryptocurrency fixes the problems.  While I know almost nothing about lightning, I do know that it has a lot of potential and likely will solve many problems.  Simply increasing block size, while I too like to think it will fix everything, will not fix everything.
It's not that devs need to look at the market.  There's nothing they can do there.  They are doing their best to ensure a solid foundation by ensuring code works great and has no basic underlying problems (like block size issues) that will prohibit growth in the future.  We still need a size increase, even for lightening to work. 
Additionally, lightening can work on any blockchain (or combination of blockchains), so there's that as well.

So use Namecheap.com.  It's incredibly cheap.  
If you want to be really anonymous, sign up with fake information.  If you do this through Tor, you have to contact their support team and tell them to sign you up.  You can use a free temporary email service online to sign up.
Then all you have to do is buy the domain (add funds through bitcoin and pay with account funds).  All in it's about $25 per year I think.  They give you free Whois guard, so that doesn't even matter (even though you used fake information to sign up).

However, if I decided I wanted to use a phrase that I thought of in my head as a seed, that's where the shitty ideas come in.  That's easily crackable, as BrainFlayer demonstrated (I'm assuming you've heard of it).

Dude, if you want to be anonymous (and be incredibly ridiculous about it), then use a real wallet like DarkWallet or something.
They use bloom filters which increase the anonymitity.
I use Tor a lot, and sometimes and I forget to use it.  What's to say that your IP address is the time you didn't use Tor instead of one of the times you used Tor.  Plus, you can connect to a different server every time, so nobody would be able to figure it out.  This isn't really a problem.

They first use a mixer so that it can't be traced so easily, and then they stick 90% of it in cold storage to take over the world one day when bitcoin is worth way more, and then start withdrawing their money slowly.
If it was me, I'd take like 5 or 10 BTC, say I bought them years ago (and somehow find proof or something; maybe talk to someone who actually did this and trade bitcoins with them), and then start up a ponzi scheme that pretends to be a mining operation (because we're already breaking the law by $15m at this point).  I'd "invest" my 10 BTC in it (only after like a few hundred other suckers do this), and then slowly pay out 20 BTC (doubling my money).  Then I'd "reinvest" this and get 40 BTC out.  At that point, I have enough to be happy with, I have a reasonable excuse for where it came from in the case of an audit, and I can keep doing this by creating various scams or using other scams out there like bitcoinpyramid.com (you'd loose almost half of what you invest, but you still have a more plausible excuse).  
Another option is just to go to Panama for a vacation, take out your money, stick it in a 2-foot-thick vault down there (probably cost like $15000 just for the vault and land), and then slowly smuggle it back into US/Canada/UK/where ever you live, and run away just like any other fait-criminal would do!
No osifer, I'm not doing anything illegal.

They wouldn't be stuck, people are just stupid.  You can send a receive like normal.
I'm telling you right now, you don't have malware on your computer.  Avast will tell you if you do. 
Also, the good think about Electrum is that you can view your addresses without entering your password (that's the HD wallet function).  It's actually a good thing, but it's perfectly secure.  It would be stupid to protect the whole wallet, because who cares if they can see how much you have as long as it's protected.

@_date: 2015-03-01 23:08:39
Blockchain.info is perfectly fine.  Tons of people use it *for small amounts.*  However, there have been glitches in the past with them (all of which were eventually resolved, but still...).  
I have switched wallets almost half a dozen times since I started using bitcoin.  Electrum is the wallet I fell in love with.  It's simple and easy, but still awesome.
If the Electrum website disappeared, you'd be fine.  Electrum works off of Electrum servers that people host in their houses and in datacenters.  You'd be fine if the Electrum website disappeared.
Alright, so let's say that all 150 of these privately-operated servers shut down at once (because the world hates you...that's why).  In Electrum, you can export your private keys, and then import them into a different wallet (just like you would with a paper wallet).
If the Electrum website disappeared and you didn't have the Electrum program installed, you could just download it from somewhere online.  As soon as their website disappeared, all bitcoin advocates would start posting the Electrum client online for download from other locations so that you can still continue to use it.
On top of that, there are other programs that support the Electrum seed format (BIP32).  Google around for more information.
In terms of your keylogger fear, I'm just gonna ask: does your computer have a keylogger installed?  If it does, I'm gonna say it's not secure, otherwise it's fine.  Really, you're being over-paranoid.  If you really want to be safe, just copy and paste the seed without retyping it (because ain't nobody got time for that).
Hope this helps! ChangeTips are appreciated :)

Is there a different block explorer that still allows it?

Probably mostly advertising (both getting your site out there and adding ads).  Maybe other coins (like Dogecoin and Litecoin) as well.  And possibly an explanation on how you know who to send the coins back to (because you don't give each visitor a unique address).
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:50:15
First, the transmission between the Trezor and computer are very limited.  This rules out that it's possible for key extraction or editing what's displayed on the Trezor screen.  What you see is what you get.
On that note, the Trezor asks you to confirm the transaction before you send it.  Therefore if the website were hacked to send an unsigned transaction to your Trezor that send all your coins to a hacker, you'd see this on the Trezor screen and decline signing.  
The link between the Trezor and the computer is not like a normal link where anything goes.  The Trezor is designed to only accept certain types of data (so no malware could be sent), and it displays everything it's doing on the screen so the human can verify it.  It would be very similar to a human manually typing all the data between the Trezor and the computer because we get to see it anyway.
I hope that this provides you with enough information to begin the removal of your head from your ass.

It's easy and open, there isn't anything hidden and everything is really easy to explain (here's your list of addresses, here's where your addresses come from [the seed], here's your MPK for offline use, and here's how you send).  That's it.
No funky hidden addresses or anything, and it's not all colorful and distracting like many mobile wallets.

With password, if you're hacked all you have to do is change your password.  With a phone wallet, all you have to do is get a new phone.

@_date: 2015-03-29 16:34:28
Use a deterministic cold storage wallet, it's way easier and you can keep track of it all in Electrum with the MPK.  It's what I do, and it's worked great for me.

App does not imply mobile.  App means application, which is a piece of computer software that includes a GUI.  The question was very ambiguous and should have included a requested platform.

I want one because they sound like awesome little beasts, and who doesn't want one.  I have been actively involved in the bitcoin community for a number of years, and am one of the few people who still run a little mining operation out of my basement.  I have a large amount of bitcoins that I've acquired through the years (since I started in October 2012), and am looking into different ways of storing them (currently using a Trezor, but they're so expensive).  This would be a great way to get started with a cheaper alternative, and would allow me to create a mass number of wallets efficiently to give out to people in a secure manner.  It is also a great conversation starter for other people getting into bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:16:07
Electrum completely.  It's easy and secure.  As long as you keep your computer secure, you're fine.  And then you can use Electrum to create a cold storage wallet, and be completely secure.  I always move &gt;1 BTC to my cold storage, and just the live wallet for everything else.

The problem with Electrum is that anyone could write an easy virus that uploads your wallet to an online server.  That same virus could have a keylogger and get your password when you send a transaction in Electrum.  It uploads that to the server too.  It now has all your transactions.  
With a Trezor your keys are stored on the device.  There's no risk at all of them just being taken off of the device.

In terms of being anonymous, you're not gaining much.  Tor already makes you remain partially anonymous by using bloom filters.  No Electrum server operator is going to look at your IP and piece it all together (Electrum server doesn't log connection data). 
The only advantage is bypassing firewalls.  At my workplace, they block all the high ports, so I use Tor to get Electrum through the firewalls (it's the only practical use).

Very true, I'm not even going to bother with the stupid hypotheticals so-called "nerds" would throw out.  But it's also a pain in the ass.  I used to do it before I got a Trezor, but it's a pain just to power up that computer in the corner, create the transaction online, save to USB, etc. 
That's the advantage of the Trezor over offline signing.  The argument about online vs offline signing though...that's the one I'll advocate heavily for.

Fine.  You win.  Lucky for me, I'm not a little dumbass fuckup like you, so I'd never fall prey to that kind of stupidity.  The Trezor is not insecure.  Facebook is not insecure.  User stupidity is insecure.  Same about computers and banks.  But I still have all of my 100 bitcoins, and you're down over $1000.  Sucks to be you, ya loser.
And I **do** look at what's on the Trezor, I don't blindly push keys.  Because I find joy in *laughing* at losers like you.  I'm not one of your kind, I have an IQ of over 60.
FYI, I've read the Trezor code.  It does not accept data that can change things on the device, it only accepts what's necessary to make the transaction.

Yes, I agree in general.
However, just because it's open source doesn't mean they have no obligation.  Not that it really applies to this project, but the bitcoin core developers have an obligation.  Even though they're not on a direct payroll, it is still their job to make sure that the bitcoin core code is maintained.

Depends what wallet provider you use.  Electrum would keep working forever because there are so many servers.  However, wallets like blockchain.info would require a large amount of work to extract the private key.  If Coinbase went under, everyone would be without their funds.

I understand that, but the point is Apple makes mistakes: they should have had a protection so that you couldn't brute force passwords on their servers (like a minimum of 1 second between login attempts, or max of 20 attempts per day, etc.).

To send, you have to use the online wallet (because it knows from which addresses [which have what balance] to send) to create an unsigned transaction in the send tab.  Then, you copy it to a USB stick, take it to the offline computer, go Tools &gt; Load Transaction &gt; From file...

It's a lot of work, I think you should just go buy a Trezor.  Let me know if you're interested, because I can get you a discount.

I don't think the current issue is that nobody can set it up...you download a file and double click it.  It's that nobody wants to, and nobody port forwards so that it actually helps the network.  That's what really needs to be done is the port forwarding step so that other nodes can download the blockchain from that node.

Good for you, that's crazy awesome!

That doesn't even make sense.  Private key and mining are so very different.

That is one sexy device, where can I buy one?

Not true, I pay my electricity based on size, not on growth.

The milliliter is not ml, it's mL (might want to update that in your units section)

As long as the device isn't jailbroken, I'd agree accept for the fact that you carry it around with you everywhere, so easier theft.  But in general, yes.  Trezor is just a better device that's not nearly as open to exploits as Breadwallet/iOS is (but after all, Apple never gets hacked - thought Jennifer Lawrence as her photos were leaked).

Best answer yet :)

Yes, sorry, you're right.
I meant large amount of effort to do a full wallet (quite a few keys), with payments continuing to come into those addresses, for the average person.
As a coder, it would take like 20 minutes to extract all the keys, import them, and get them automatically redirected.  As a normal person, that could be an afternoon activity (that, by my books, is quite a bit of effort).

Yus.  This is the answer.

Sorry, I should have been more clear.  The idea behind telnet is that if it doesn't give you an error, you've connected successfully (and can just assume that bitcoind isn't malfunctioning somehow).  However if it tells you it cannot connect because of a timeout or connection refused or something, this tells you that bitcoind stopped listening, your port forwarding isn't set up, etc.  It's similar to netstat. The idea is not to send commands, just hit "Control+]" and then type "quit" to get out of telnet.
Your problems are probably just because of bitnodes.io being weird, I had the same problem for a bit but then it magically fixed itself with them!  Give it a day or two and pray.

In all honesty, don't keep more than a few hundred bucks on your phone (keep the rest in cold storage with a Trezor).  Write down that seed on a piece of paper at your house, and leave it there.  The Drive is not giving you any advantage.

Can you tell us the character encoding?  Just verify that it's UTF-8?

Dude, reading the comments here seriously just made my day.  Thank you for bringing a smile to my face.

If I go buy other virtual currency (like a gift card [I know it's not virtual currency, but it's the closest thing we have]), I don't have to wait 24 hours.  That's what bitcoin should be like.

I guess you could say they are, but they're not just the third party.  They're the third through 100,000th party, and that's why the system works.
And of course you can get into 51% attacks and what not, but the odds of anything like that happening is so remote that it doesn't need to be considered or worried about.

Have you heard of Google?  It doesn't make fun of idiotic newbs like you.

Yus, someone needs to invent that right now
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:07:24
Go buy a Trezor.  I was skeptical at first, but you won't regret it, I promise.  They're nifty little things.  I've got a coupon for $20 one if you want.
@_date: 2015-02-14 19:50:20
That looks like a pretty radical website, especially with how provably fair it is.  Good for you, I'm impressed.  What are your future plans for the website?
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:48:59
It's up for me if you're wondering, tested it with telnet
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:21:09
Yeah, you don't have to download shit to use it.  The main servers who keep the blockchain will have 50 TB hard drives in a decade, so it really won't matter.  Go Google "Moore's Law", and see how it applies to this.
@_date: 2015-02-26 00:19:49
On a serious note, how do you hold these bitcoins?  Have you considered a Trezor?
If you're looking for a Trezor coupon, PM me and I can hook you up with $20 off a Trezor.

Can someone explain what OneCoin is?  I haven't heard about this new scam.
@_date: 2015-02-23 16:46:07
Look how much we have in common, I'm in Canada too!  (so yes, it does apply there)
PM me if you're interested, it's a $40 off coupon (technically it's 33% off on up to 10 Trezors in case you want to buy a bunch), and I'm selling the coupon for $20 (so you net $20 on a purchase of one Trezor, $60 off two Trezors, or $100 off three Trezors).

What if they come from multiple input addresses?  Which input address are they sent back to?
