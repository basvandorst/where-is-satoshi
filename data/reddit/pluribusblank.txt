spendbitcoins.com is based in Austrailia.  I don't know if they do paypal but they take cash deposits at Austrailian banks.

Great to hear!  Two companies that can help merchants accept bitcoins are  and paysius.com.  You may want to check them out if you haven't already.  Of course one of the unique features of bitcoin is that you can accept it yourself without a payment processor if you like.  Keep us informed!

I hear you.  I guess time will tell.  To me it's not so much a question of is it possible, it's a question of what is the goal of it and does it justify the cost?
If a government or coalition wants spend money to destroy Bitcoin, that means they are threatened by it.  Why are they threatened by it?  Because it's powerful.  Powerful for what?  'Sound' money, and payments.  Sound money and payments for whom?  Anyone, INCLUDING governments.  So if they want to benefit from it's power, they can't destroy it.  
Let's say the G8 decides to attack Bitcoin because they feel it threatens the reserve currency they control (which is a stretch for the next few decades at least).  That still leaves 200+ countries that may have an interest in preventing a G8 mining majority.
Lots of things are possible.  But I think worries of one government or multinational arbitrarily deciding to dump a few hundred million to destroy bitcoin are both over simplified and over exaggerated.

Yes, if you wait until the launch. What I'm saying is, the respective players knew that the others were working on A-bombs in advance.  
A government doesn't need to wait until an attacker actually launches a 51% attack to defend against it.  All they have to do is mine themselves at a fraction of the hashpower they think their opponent is likely to bring to bear.  It's much easier (and cheaper) to defend against a 51% attack than it is to launch one.

Is the country of the purchaser relevant when calculating VAT?  There is no VAT in my country.  
@_date: 2013-01-31 13:20:55
Agreed.  I just don't want anyone to mistakenly think those numbers are going to be realistic long term.
Definitely pretty awesome tho!
@_date: 2013-02-05 16:01:01
But in real life, major players do act against each other in concert.
Germany didn't wait until after the US dropped the A-bomb to start working on their own.  They were in fact developing in concert.  They were doing this because Germany's army of formidable eggheads was telling them the same thing that the US' army of formidable eggheads was telling the US government.  Namely, that an A-bomb was possible to build and if they didn't build one, the other side would and use it against them.
Granted, nothing is certain.  I'm not saying it CAN'T happen.  What I'm saying is that in real life, a given government has access to more or less the same information as other governments.  We don't know exactly what decisions they will make based on that information, but I maintain that if one government thinks Bitcoin is worth killing, chances are high that other governments will think it's worth saving and take steps in that direction.  I could be wrong.  We'll see :)
@_date: 2013-02-03 19:36:11
Understood.  What I'm saying is that if Bitcoin is powerful enough that the US (or whoever) wants to spend billions to try to kill it, then it's powerful enough for China (or whoever) to spend billions to try to prevent them.

You don't have to chose Bitcoin OR gold.  They each have different strengths.  You can do both.

This Wired article from 1994 shows some great examples of how typical people failed to see the value of the internet in the early years.
@_date: 2013-01-28 23:44:18
Interesting.  What if the purchaser is outside the EU?  
@_date: 2013-01-30 18:00:22
This will not happen because &lt;math&gt;.
If you're worried about it anyway, don't store your life savings in a single wallet.  Spread it out among 100 different wallets.  This way if one key is (somehow magically against all odds) randomly duplicated, you still have 99% of your money.
@_date: 2013-02-03 02:44:34
It's the same reasoning that prevents any actor from attempting a 51% attack - the benefits do not justify the cost.  
It seems reasonable that if / when Bitcoin grows to a point that any government feels threatened by it, then the other governments of the world will also feel threatened by it.  They will all have a vested interest in mining to ensure their own transactions are processed, and to prevent the other sovereigns from achieving 51%.  It would be an arms race that no one will ever win.
In other words, the Bitcoin network will continue to function the same way it does now.

Fair enough about miners having a short term incentive to discourage others from getting in.  However, you are forgetting that current miners have already purchased their hardware, and may have it paid off by now.  (Disclosure: I am mining bitcoins and my equipment is paid off).  For these individuals, their only expenses are operating expenses (electricity).  
New miners, on the other hand, will have not only operating expenses, but capital expenses, i.e. they will have to purchase hardware and break even on their investment at some point.  If we assume that ASICs will come out in the not too distant future, causing the difficulty to skyrocket, it is unlikely that a hardware investment in GPUs will pay off any time soon, if ever.  This is what current miners mean when they say it's no longer worth it to get into mining with GPUs.
If we assume that ASICs never come to market, then that changes the math.  But even if we assume that all of the current vendors advertising ASICs never deliver, it's only a matter of time before SOMEONE builds them.  When this happens, it will destroy profitability for GPU miners who have not yet broken even.

Agreed.  Except I would say Bitcoin now is closer to the internet in 1993 than 1998.  
I had to convince my blue collar dad to buy a first gen Pentium 60 for $2500 (printer included).  I talked him up from the $2000 486.  It did not come with a modem, I had to purchase that separately.  To get online, I had to purchase an ISP account for $20 a month (a bill that did not exist previously), and monopolize the family phone line for hours at a time.  
What could I do once on the internet?  Practically nothing, by today's standards.  No Youtube or video of any kind, no Facebook, no MP3s, no Skype, no online banking, no Google Maps.  Photos took forever to load.  Regular people I knew were vaguely aware of the word 'internet', but didn't really know what it was.  They were generally unfamiliar with the term 'website'.  The whole thing seemed like a weird, expensive waste of time to them.  But geeks like us saw the coolness and potential usefulness of a worldwide communication network.
As we used that communication network for our weird geeky hobbies and academic pursuits, over time, the rest of the world slowly started to see that potential too.  Now, the internet is so huge a whole generation of 20 year olds can't imagine life without it.  They live in an online world.  
Now, geeks like us see the potential usefulness of a worldwide payment network.  It seems weird and arcane to to regular folks now, but as they see us using it, over time they'll slowly begin to realize the value.
How long before they demand that their money moves into the 21st century?

From my perspective, the main cause of the crash was the Mt.Gox hack and subsequent week long outage.  All of the sudden people wondered if they were going to be able to change their coins back to dollars.  In other words there was a crisis of confidence in the exchanges and the online wallets.  The MyBitcoin online wallet disappearing act a few weeks later further damaged the public perception.  The press was full of 'The Fall of Bitcoin' but really nothing about Bitcoin had changed.  Bitcoin itself just works as advertised, and always has.  Those who were unable to understand that lost confidence, bailed out and lost money.  Those of us who remembered the fundamentals hadn't changed gritted our teeth and tried to think long term.  We knew (hoped) that other individuals like ourselves would continue to use Bitcoin for the things it does better than anything else.  Worldwide value transfer, in moments, for free, without permission from anyone.  There's still no other way to do it, and that's why Bitcoin is valuable.  It's just a matter of time until the rest of the world catches on.
The real trick is to remember that the next time the price drops :)

bitcoincharts.com lists most of the Bitcoin exchanges.  Mt. Gox is the largest.  Most have APIs. 
I believe Bitpay's solution involves averaging quotes from three different exchanges.  They can give you more details.

The short non-technical answer is that the Bitcoin network as it exists today cannot handle the kind of volume you are talking about.  However, this is not a show stopper.  There is quite a bit of room for the existing transaction volume to grow before any real problems occur.  The developers are well aware of the challenges and there are a number of potential solutions on the radar, should they become necessary.
Details (and a lot of other useful information) can be found here:

This... is actually really great.  
@_date: 2013-02-02 18:54:23
This is certainly true as of today.  However this situation will improve over time.
In my opinion, the computer security habits of non-geeks will have to change in the near future, with or without Bitcoin.  So much of our personal and financial lives are on our PCs and phones that those who fail to learn to secure them will get burned with increasing frequency.
@_date: 2013-01-31 04:01:52
Those numbers assume today's difficulty.  The difficulty will skyrocket once the other ASICs are brought online and the profit will drop by orders of magnitude.
@_date: 2013-01-29 22:40:07
Why not let the economists and investors decide for themselves?
Even if they don't all choose to participate, Bitcoin is a fascinating subject to study for anyone interested in market behavior and capitalism.

Nice.  File lockers are a natural service to benefit from payment in Bitcoin.  Although ideally, the fields asking for your address and personal information would disappear when the Bitcoin option is chosen, since they are no longer necessary for the transaction.

For what it's worth - accepting payments in Bitcoin makes sense for a business like cbtnuggets.  Your product is digital, the market you are trying to reach is tech savvy and potentially global.

Because if the cost justified the attempt, it wouldn't be attempted by only ONE government.  If the cost justified the attempt, then other governments and large corporations would also make the attempt.  The total hash power would rise each time a new player came in, making all of the attackers have to continue adding hash power ad infinitum.  They would all be throwing money into a giant hole because none of the players could afford to allow one of the other players to achieve majority.
