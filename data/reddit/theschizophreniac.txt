If you don't mind me asking, do you have any bitcoins stuck in Mt. Gox?
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:35:20
More like 500,000 times the answer.

Who is "they", how are they going to dilute it, and isn't 2^x or 10^x catchier ?

The main revenue generating services of banks are investment banking and securities trading.  Both of these only exist in financial hubs like New York, Chicago, LA, London etc. with New York dominating most other financial hubs by far. 
I'd venture to say about half of their revenue comes from activities this building. If you only look at private/commercial banking branch revenues and electricity consumption, I'm sure we'd see a different picture.

True dat. People talk about bitcoin electricity consumption as if it will melt half of Antarctica.

Those things are priceless to me as well. :)
I was talking about physical value, and another user has made the point that it saves money that would've otherwise gone to paypal or visa and thus actually does  create material value.

I finished all of my freelancing work and went to the gym today, met with my friends just yesterday, and college doesn't start for another 2 weeks. So right now, I really don't have anything better to do than redditing (which helps me with my English skills) and reading up on and writing about finance (which is my intended career path).
**TL;DR**: No  :(

I'd have to disagree. They make fees off of advisory services in which they find the most efficient way of financing investments and operations. They provide capital to individuals and enterprises who in return create wealth.  They create investment vehicles for depositors to generate returns for endowments, pensions etc. 
Sure, they do some shady stuff but they're not all that bad and probably a net positive overall.

Well, I suppose  some large scale aspects of consumer &amp; community banking do take place in the headquarters.
Regardless, that's a lot more than I was expecting for JP Morgan. But then again, they do own Chase. Would you happen to know  what percentage of BoA's revenue comes from corporate and investment banking?
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:34:49
Value as a method of payment. Excellent point.  
However, I think what really makes bitcoin intangibly valuable is the signal it sends to those who control fiat money. A signal that says "Don't mess  with our money, because we have a viable alternative."
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:44:05
Aww, thanks. I try to do my best.
@_date: 2015-08-13 14:30:45
BoA's total value : $ 244 billion - and the majority of its $85 billion worth of  revenue generating activities (investment banking and trading) take place in this  building.
Bitcoin market capitalization: $4 billion and it doesn't create revenue or physical value.
 
The BoA tower is more efficient in terms of both market capitalization and value created per unit of electricty. That is not to say that this makes bitcoin any less of a great idea.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:48:36
Well, as everyone on this sub would know, generating currency isn't generating wealth, which these banks are doing as I've discussed in other posts, but I digress. 
The comparison is a good answer to those who say that it creates ridiculous amounts of electricity consumption.
@_date: 2015-08-13 15:42:51
I appreciate it.  32% of 85 billion is still 27.2 billion, so I stand behind my point for electricity. 
On a totally seperate note, maybe one day we'll have a bitcoin based investment bank. One can only dream.

Through financial wizardry. 
Let's say google goes to BoA or Goldman Sachs and asks to be restructured. The bank comes up with a way to reorganize the firm and creates Alphabet inc. This process involves complex financial modeling and financing, so it can't be done without a bank. Let's say google's restructuring saves it 5 Billion dollars per year. There's 5 billion dollars (pulled that out of my ass but not unlikely for a company like google) that can be spent on other things such as R&amp;D, expansion etc. Poof! Value generation. 
When large multinational corporations do this kind of thing they do it in the banks' New York headquarters. All of the analysts, computers, capital finding people, dealmakers  etc. responsible for Google's restructuring are in that building. The tower itself doesn't create that value, but the activities going on inside it do.
The private banking that we see everyday is a drop in the ocean compared to the work they do with big corporations.
Edit: Okay maybe it's a bit more than a drop in the ocean.

I assume that you're talking about that Czech Tomas guy. Let's assume he was misidentified (seems likely at this point) and the thief is someone else. What if the thief decides to tumble the merchandise in small amounts like 10 bitcoins at a time? Could he get away with it?
@_date: 2013-12-03 20:03:12
10 ? 
All I can think of is asking the recipient nicely, and hoping they are a nice person.If they don't respond maybe you can contact coinbase. Sorry for the loss.
