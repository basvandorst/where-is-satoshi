As long as the crypto public blindly champions the concept of infallable immutability as the ultimate blockchain solution then these events will not only continue, but get worse and worse with zero hope of the other 99.99% of the populace ever using this technology.  
Time to consider a blockchain that has an integrated legal framework/mutability where agreed upon thefts could be remedied.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:02:49
This is the Achillis heel of all the fanboys who fawn over the great Immutable blockchain and it is also why no immutable blockchain will EVER gain mainstream appeal.
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:21:19
What all these never ending thefts reveal is that the claimed 'holy grail of Immutability' is not perfect and maybe there is an opportunity to have a blockchain based legal framework that determines a valid theft in which, in the next update would return the stolen funds minus legal fees.  
I think this is possible with Ethereum's codebase and possibly also bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:34:01
That list reveals the fallability of 'immutability is sacred' more than anything else.
To have the rest of the world use something, an easy way to correct thefts would stop 100% of thefts and attempted thefts as it would remove the incentive to ever try.
And that product is one that the rest of the planet can get behind instead of the just the lawless fringe as it is now.

This is actually a copy of Vericoin's tech.  You've been able to send Vericoins via sms for a while now and spend it everywhere just like Bitcoin too.  Good to see coinkite adding it to Bitcoin.  Find out more here.

He's the equivalent of a company that illegally charges peoples credit cards with fraudulent charges and then only refunds the monies of people who find out and complain.  He keeps all the rest which is most all of the stolen money.

You could do this first with Vericoin.  Nice to see its expanding to BTC.
@_date: 2014-12-08 18:24:35
I'm going to put this out there.  
The entire concept of having your bank account online in an identified public location where an anonymous attacker could take your funds without recourse........is flawed and actually kind of reckless.  Just because a business provides a service doesn't mean its a smart idea to use it.
Keep your funds at home, in your phone, in a safe, or under your bed......I don't care.  But putting them online and trusting a 3rd party startup with your funds is a very very bad idea.

Yes.  It does with the exception of a couple of SMS gateways with weird setups.  Plus you can earn interest holding VRC so that's nice and you can spend VRC everywhere that accepts BTC.
@_date: 2014-04-04 20:25:49
At this point I would not be shocked to see BTC continue to drift all the way back below $100.  "NO WAY!!!" You Say?
The reason is this.  Supply and demand.  Back when BTC exploded to $1200 it was new and there were far fewer bitcoins in existence so as China came on board, they had to buy this coin to get it.  Simple small supply relative to demand pushed the price up to tulip bubble levels.  Now that the ASICs are here and there are many more coins in existence and many more created daily, the supply is simply greater than the current demand and thus the price is waning.  People are mining it and selling for dollars but who new is coming in to buy those bitcoins????
The key to stopping this long slide back down is generating millions and millions of brand new users of Bitcoin.  And this can't happen until it is simple and easy for grandma or soccer mom to buy something at BedBath and Beyond or keep it safe in a savings account.  This is why regulation and clarity from governments is good.  It brings us 1 step closer to the masses being able to use this coin for day to day transactions and savings accounts.  All our efforts should be to support the entrepreneurs who are developing platforms that make it easier to use your phone to pay with bitcoins, or the bitcoin atms, and maybe even collectively setup an FDIC type institution that guarantees savers against losses for qualifying bitcoin banking institutions.  In my mind, this is the key to heading off the slow death that we have been seeing in the entire virtual currency markets.

@_date: 2014-11-02 00:33:26
Sorry, but you are thinking about this wrong.
Your divisibility argument is not a logical one to argue for a declining price.  Divisibility does not affect supply.  Very simply, when the daily fiat demand for Bitcoins increases to more than the number of Bitcoins being created per day then you will see the price begin to rise.  Currently the rate of new bitcoin creation is greater than the rate of new Bitcoin purchases so the price is adjusting downward.
@_date: 2014-07-28 07:05:03
I'll agree with this.  You have years worth of sell supply that previously couldn't get out and now it can be used to buy anything at Dell and a host of other major outlets.  Once that pent up backlog dwindles one could expect the price to rebound due to the sell supply drying up.
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:21:13
The guy is literally inserting his religion (even prayers) into the bitcoin code and wants everyone to bend to his will because he thinks he is doing God's work.  Just as ISIS thinks they are doing God's work when they chop off heads or enslave and rape women for lifetimes.  Religion is mind poison to justify evil.

Why would so many people believe that he is trolling?  It's not like any of the information is that surprising.  It makes perfect sense the FED would secretly research and try to understand Bitcoin's possible threat to them and it makes perfect sense that there is a scenario that takes over a decade but Bitcoin or a similar virtual currency becomes a default currency for many across the globe.
These are just models and they can also be extremely inaccurate for predicting the future.  For example, using Bitcoin's previous growth model when it was being adopted by the bleeding edge users to extrapolate forward for mass adoption and during Gov. regulation and attacks should have a high error rate.  The low hanging fruit of fast adopters could have already been claimed which would strongly change their models.

Picking it up on the cheap!?  
Heck, I bet you anything they were the ones behind crashing the price to sub $200 from $600 just so they could begin picking it up on the cheap.  They simply used the low BTC volumes to easily sell and short sell the price down.
Wallstreet doesn't like chasing prices so they simply "engineer" the price they want and boom, they suddenly got in at early 2013 prices.

POS has staking or virtual mining which also "maintains the network".  It just does it while using 99% less electricity so its an evolution forward.

So they've been officially broke since 2014 and officially running a ponzi scheme since 2014 taking in new money to pay any exiting withdrawals and they were able to successfully hide this fact for 1.5 years until public perception turned which made withdrawals higher than the deposits.  This effectively was the tide going out finally revealing that Cryptsy was naked the whole time.

Given the stolen BTC are still in the same address from 2014.  It makes you wonder if the perp has lost the private keys, or forgotten about them, or died.  
@_date: 2017-01-04 02:15:19
I forgot to ask this as well.  Who and how many people actually control the keys to the coins?  And is it in a multisig wallet? Offline storage? 
 Do they state the processes and manner in which the Trust safeguards and controls the funds?
Given its on an OTC exchange I think many buyers might assume a greater safety of their funds and probably don't realize the level of risk of the Trust being attacked in some manner and the coins stolen.

What if the real cancer is the people who continue to cause a worldwide transactional system to clog up, bog down, and spike in user costs; and seem to be doing it on purpose or otherwise could give 2 shits if the network worked for the users.
What if those guys are the real cancer?

Why does the network not work without being clogged and with massive theft fees?
Why is core or blockstream not fixing the problem?

Given Germany purposely hides the identity of refugee criminals to keep people from knowing how many rapes and violence they commit and routinely raid homes of people who simply tweet that the refugees are not good for their country and want them to leave, I'd say Leftwing Nazism or Fascism is a pretty accurate statement when referring to Germany or Sweden.

I guess this woman isn't being raped by hordes of refugees either.
Even the American reporter was raped by hordes of Muslims while her film crew was helpless.  
Because in the Islamic world.  It's not really a crime at all to rape a woman who is not covered up.  Especially a non muslim women.  That's actually the point Muslim scholars say to justify forcing women to wear Burkas.  If you don't wear the Burka, then you get what's coming to you.

The Native Americans were pro open borders too.  Think about that for a second and how that worked out for them in the long run.
Also you should know that the refugees have 6-10+ children routinely and 40% of German children 5 and under are Muslim children.  Unless German citizens wake the F up and get rid of Merkel and shut down the unlimited open borders, Germany will be a Muslim nation within 1 generation.
