The world needs a decentralized international currency controlled by no one. Government cannot provide this. The bitcoin protocol will continue for ever with proper updates when needed. 
Bitcoin ultimate does not care what people think about it. If someone is willing to (process transactions )mine it, Bitcoin will survive.

Many shitcoin will fail. Someone will figure out a use case for some of the coins/protocols. I don’t know who the winners will be, but I think their is value in decentralized censorship resistant bitcoin.

The real use case is international trade &amp; settlement. Bitcoin is not going to be a local transactional currency. Bitcoin is the glue that holds government’s money-creation-ability accountable. 
Why hold govt fiat when they change the rules monthly?  
In the past countries can use bronze coins as a local transactional currency, but wealth was always gold and silver.

I keep a ten word password phrase at work. If my keepkey is lost to fire or stolen, keepkey claims my ten word passcode is able to recover lost bitcoins. I don't understand the technology behind the recovery of a destroyed keepkey, but various YouTube videos vouch for keepkey.

Thanks, but I don't know if segwit is the best decision.
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:15:47
Buy now. I think the miners are calling our bluff. They will accept segwit. Btc will explode after segwit is accepted.

@_date: 2017-03-13 23:27:34
Segwit is a short term solution and 100% safe. BU is a long term solution and very risky b/c the hard fork =2 btc. And the price goes down.

Litecoin is trying to be money. They achieved this status. Litecoin is a dependable safe currency. Ethereum is not really a "money" ethereum is trying to solve some problems that will make the world run smoother. But neo is the Chinese ethereum and has an advantage to be the premier smart contract  currency in china. Tezos has supposedly made a better smart contract language called ocamel. E.g. Tezos has wall st. ties and maybe a easy smart contract platform. Ethereum could get left behind. 
Lastly maybe rootstock could be added into bitcoin and everyone else is wasting their time with their smart contract shit coin. Who knows.

Yes. I get the same feeling. Some people also made a large btc profit and now feel weird going back to bitcoin after it has gone up over a 1000

Btc don't care
@_date: 2017-04-29 03:14:18
You lost 1800 of a capital asset. You can offset gains on any passive income you receive. If you sell btc ( or stock equity) for 1000 gain you can use 1000 of the  1800 loss to offset the gain.  No offense, but you fell for a btc ponzi. I don't think it counts as theft. 1800 loss on a bad investment.
@_date: 2017-04-28 16:31:42

The world may see and understand the power of bitcoin, when there is turbulent times.
E.g., the communist part of South Africa is taking land from white South Africans. Soon the lives will be threatened. They only thing those people will escape with is bitcoin and the clothes on their back. 
E.g., Venezuela has destroyed the people’s currency.
E.g., North Korea and Russia have used crypto to get around sanctions. 
E.g., Wikileaks uses bitcoin
E.g., the alt right has used bitcoin
E.g., rich Chinese used bitcoin to go around capital controls.
E.g., if the eu fails, the euro fails too. 
Crypto currency is looking good. Bitcoin will probably be the winner.

Threatening to fork bitcoin two make a second/"fake" bitcoin cash is wrong. Segwit is not bad. If you don't like it, sell your bitcoin and move on. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:11:09
You are newbie. All the bitcoin newbies cry about "the price didn't go up yesterday"����

The investment trust put a large premium on their bitcoin. I would stay away too much risk.

Buy bitcoin the correct way. You will make you money back soon enough.

Free bitcoins for everyone!

Bitcoin could split into two on August 1st. You may want to wait a month.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:21:45
Buy. Buy. Buy. Who cares if you over buy a little. Bitcoin could explode to10k very soon.
@_date: 2017-05-12 18:29:57
I buy ever paycheck. Keepkey is my savings account.

No. There will be 2 bitcoins in September. Sorry for the pessimistic attitude, but there are no clear answers to the scaling debate. 
@_date: 2017-07-09 07:41:33
How much does you node cost? 
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:37:21
I think 10k is a big psychological point. May take a while burst through.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:21:27
Local bitcoin/ or bitcoin ATM buy bitcoin. Put bitcoin on poloniex exchange. Then buy crypto. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:58:45
Research ethereum more. Tezos , qtum, antshares, iota. All of those cryptos will steal ethereum's business. Eth has its own problems.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:54:59
Thank god.
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:27:23
Then sell. Bitcoin will go lower closer to August 1st hardfork deadline. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:50:31

I think you should try to buy some on exchanges. Use a good phone wallet like breadwallet to store btc. Also get a trezor hardware wallet to put your bitcoins on. 
Lastly consider buy bitcoin from a real person face-to-face. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:15:16
Pos is not for btc. Too much money in pow

Of course craig is a fraud. It's so obvious.

Btc Gotta scale. But nobody really uses ethereum as a currency. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:22:06
@ martketwatch.com they are having a field day. Most people will never buy/use bitcoin &amp; crypto.

Good answer 
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:05:21
It works well for me. Mostly b/c looks matter to me and the keepkey design looks cool. I cannot see the balance, but I have a good memory. The keepkey to me is a safe that I don't touch often. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:22:04
This guy is correct^
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:51:28
Sounds like the btc wallet failed you.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:10:41
I don't know what to make of this article. I think the btc network is value 
@_date: 2017-06-15 22:25:57
Long story short it's a joke from a Reddit poster urgently telling a btc user to not sell btc. HODL!!!!!
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:37:03
I am cool with the consensus and compromise.
@_date: 2017-06-19 16:31:57
Segwit 2x is a good compromise

@_date: 2017-06-12 06:58:31
As long as 5%~10% of the planet loves btc, we will be fine. Bitcoin is best for hackers ,drugs, prostitution, gambling and beating shit fiat (peso)currency. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:12:50
 and  lol. Maybe you can take advantage with many debit cards to stay under $ 2500 threshold. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 16:40:13
Anything above 2500 must be reported. Anti money laundering rules( AML) require companies to comply and turn people's info into... somewhere. USA and EU have tight AML rules. All non-shady companies will follow AML rules.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:03:12
I don't believe foreign media has any intention of telling the complete truth behind American conservatism b/c they are left leaning. Interesting to note: east Europe is most friendly to USA conservatism b/c of communist past?...

@_date: 2017-06-18 05:49:40
2011. I heard about btc at bar and thought it was gambling tokens and dumb. I heard about btc after mt gox and laughed b/c I was smart for not buying. Then in 2016 I just woke up( literally)and researched bitcoin and went ALL in. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 22:24:04
This is where we are at in bitcoin. Btc is new as fuck. The internet was invented in the eighties, but didn't get adopted until the 90s. Plus the internet was slow and limited. Decentralized crypto has not even started. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 18:13:13
Breadwallet- yes. Cold storage:Keepkey- yes trezor-yes
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:15:25

I bought bitcoin in June last year for the first time. I bought a fucking keepkey the same fucking day b/c I knew about mt. Gox. I knew that I would slowly buy bitcoin every month and bitcoin was a great technology. Why the fuck do people not protect their bitcoin?!?! I just saw a post about a guy deleting his private keys on a USB drive. He is getting married expecting a daughter and was laid off. He just threw away $10k that he desperately needs b/c he didnt want to spend $100 on a keepkey/trezor. Stupid is what stupid does.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:57:04
I would buy after aug 1st.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:03:32
Then segwitx2 is a solid compromise. Everybody wins.
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:48:51

@_date: 2017-06-03 19:47:19
Honestly you might want to wait after the potential bitcoin split.
@_date: 2017-06-07 19:56:19
Wait a year. Btc will increase in price too
@_date: 2017-06-28 04:13:35
There is no market for Onecoin. If your dad sells onecoin to someone, he just cheated someone of there money. Your dad's best hope to recover is to convince an idiot that onecoin is an investment.  I suggest that you get a Power of Attorney and control your dad's finances. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 02:39:39
I am not buying anymore until the scaling solution is Agee do upon.

Never put more than you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is very very very risky. The whole game maybe over in August. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 06:28:06
I'd say satoshi's btc is as good as gone. My guess 3million coins will never move
@_date: 2017-07-08 06:05:06
Buy it

Yes it is. Read the thread
