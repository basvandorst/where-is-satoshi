Dude get on a plane and go visit their offices.

Thanks for the responses and suggestions.  I will probably start with half and see if everything goes well.  Honestly, my primary goal isn't to earn money from BTC, so I don't really see it as an "investment".  I haven't really considered the risk involved.  The idea behind cryptos interests me more than the potential rewards.

I could Do that but they all have ridiculous fees and such.  The scam was that I would give him the codes before him sending the BTC.  He event went as far to show me a screen shot with my wallet address in the send field, googled his email and saw a bunch of scam warnings.

Thanks this is exactly what I was looking for actually, I don't want to risk money being frozen, etc; But still want to take advantage.  Do you own any shares of GBTC?
@_date: 2015-11-02 20:16:04
I'm 100% serious.  I would consider Coinbase. i'm just afraid some sort of issue would come up.  Bank Freeze, etc;

can someone explain to me exactly how the IRS is going to know he bought it in cash?  And how would they know he didn't get a loan against some other asset he owns, etc;
Doesn't have to be new income.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:20:04
Ok thanks but that doesn't really answer the question.
Hypothetically let's say the seller kept the cash and didn't deposit it.
Would the IRS know he bought it in cash?
I'm not talking about following the money trail.  I mean that specific transaction.  Would there be any indication of it being a cash transaction?  Is there something recorded in the title or deed that states it was a cash deal?
And is there any evidence that the IRS seeks this sort of things out?
Real estate people buy houses in cash all the time.

awesome, thanks

OK, and why is more BTC suddenly being purchased?
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:04:50
google is usually good at blocking out malicious sites, so this is surprising!
