Back in 1992 I printed out a chat session I had with a girl from New York.
I took it to school and showed it to my friends.
All I wanted to do was prove that I was talking to a girl.
But, they got all hung up on the what instead of the who.
They got all snarky and sarcastic with me.
Email, internet, chatting, text messaging...
They were all like bitcoin is right now.

I'm not thrilled about the idea, but numismatist is right. This will happen. I suspect bitcoin backed bank notes will reach more than a niche market. We can argue "with bitcoin you don't need to rely on a bank" all we like. The vast majority of people are fine with relying on banks, and they're already familiar with paper money. I suspect most of them think current paper money is backed by something. At least with bitcoin notes it would be easy to audit and ensure the notes are backed by something. I'm assuming the notes would be redeemable. The bearer of a note could take it to the bank and get the bitcoins.
Any other solution that involves trying to hide the private key will simply lead to ordinary people asking: What the hell is a "private key"?

But the cryptosphere simply has to weather hostility from the banking sector - what else did we realistically mostly expect? Cryptocurrency and blockchain technology is their kryptonite so they aren't likely to be welcoming it with open arms, much as I think it is still profitable for well-managed banks to profit with crypto just like they always have with gold. Although I won't forget the "seen a ghost" reaction when I casually wandered into a Commonwealth Bank branch in North Melbourne (Victoria, Australia) asking if I could exchange my wad of $100 bills for gold bullion!

@_date: 2014-09-02 20:51:47
It's really just a simple waiting game. There is a strong need for a world reserve currency (currently filled by USD, and somewhat my EUR). Fiat currencies have a 100% failure rate, and an average life expectancy of 27 years. Even USD we use today is only about 45 years old, since it switched from being a gold-backed currency to free floating fiat in 1971. So as long as you believe that bitcoin, being an open-source free-to-innovate platform, can continue to exist and be innovated on top of, it should simply outlast all other fiat currencies one by one, with the countries of those failed currencies adopting both bitcoin and the last world reserve currency. If USD collapses within a few short years, with bitcoin adoption still being low those countries will adopt both bitcoin and EUR. If USD lasts for a few more decades, most countries will probably end up using USD and BTC already, and will switch exclusively to BTC as soon as USD dies. At that point, BTC will have completely replaced all fiat.
There's also the black hole fiat collapse scenario, where if bitcoin gains about 50% of world-wide adoption, where it will not make a difference for a merchant or person whether he receives USD or BTC, at that point BTC's technological advantages over USD will kick in full force, people will start preferring BTC, and as a result, the balance of use will tip greatly in BTC's favor. This also means that with more and more people choosing to take BTC, BTC adoption and price will suddenly skyrocket, people will start dumping dollars to switch to BTC, which will make BTC price go up even faster, which will cause more people to switch, over and over in a self feeding cycle, with BTC literally sucking out all the wealth from the USD in a very short period of time. The 50% adoption rate is the "event horizon" in this black hole scenario, and if this happens, it will happen VERY suddenly and VERY quickly, likely causing a whole lot of damage to people too slow to keep up in the process.

The full proposal covers why Bitcoin is necessary: 


We should also clear up why Bitcoin is required for BitMedia to work. There are three main reasons that something like PayPal would not work properly for this system of donations and tips:
Microtransactions - The base fee on a traditional payment system is usually around $0.30. The 3% discount rate is then charged on top of that flat amount. This means PayPal and debit cards are impractical for donations, tips, and votes under $1.
Chargebacks - Chargebacks would also be a huge issue in this system. We cannot have people reversing payments after they’ve made a donation. Posting original content is basically an irreversible transaction because it’s impossible to get something removed from the Internet after it is already out there. Since the content creator is posting a piece of work that cannot be taken back later, the same concept needs to be applied to the donations and tips. Otherwise, there could be a situation where donors/tippers/voters take back their money after the content has been posted. The content creator would be left with no payment for their work. This is especially troublesome in the Bitcoin vote monetization model because the voters who are able to make chargebacks could impact the results of the poll without having any intention of making a donation.
Censorship - Bitcoin is censorship-resistant money. There would undoubtedly be unpopular content posted on BitMedia. People still need to be able to make their donations when this problem occurs. PayPal, Visa, Mastercard, and other payment companies cannot be trusted to always be fair when it comes to who can receive donations. When these companies blocked Wikileaks from receiving donations in 2011, supporters of the document-leaking organization were able to make donations with Bitcoin.

If they banned Bitcoin in Canada, the Co-op would keep doing what we're doing until literally forced to stop. I don't think the Foundation's Bangladeshi affiliate can be counted out, either. You can get away with a surprising number of things in South Asia if you have more money than the local police, which most bitcoiners do.

Agreed. Crazy commissions for money transfer is something that should've stayed in 20th century. 
With cryptocurrencies everybody has the option to send whatever amount of funds with a commission so low that it becomes practically free. Some currencies are even offering anonymity to this transaction, so nobody will gain an information about your funds or your identity and won't ask for some kind of documents.
