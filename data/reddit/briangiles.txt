Interesting idea. I have an idea in the works, nothing like yours at all, but *if* it got off the ground, paying employees in BTC would be a pretty cool thing to do.
Thanks for the response, and good luck!

I'm confused why would the card be hosting the funds and phone/desktop/account? You're less likely to find a place that accepts NFC payments, while almost all stores accept debit cards.

I could have been a little more wide, but I didn't want a huge long list which made the survey look longer than it needed to.
[There are 58 ways people choose to identify their genders]( 
I put 'other' to hopefully let people who felt they were not properly identified have at least somewhere to mark. I have a lot of friends who fall into those categories, and I sincerely hope I didn't offend anyone by not listing their gender identity.

Fist, I love data and I searched and saw we were a few moths past the last survey. Second, I'm trying to get a better idea of the breakdown of who is interested in, or who had a vested interest in bitcoin's future. I'm trying to see who 'we' are and I hope that this data will help others both users, investors, business leaders, get a sense of who the community of bitcoin is.

Transfer fees to my bank. Bitstam wants a minimum $15 fee to do that, coinbase wanted about $1 ish and circle looks like that's free on the transfer part.

Wow! I Swore that was in there when I wrote this thing up. Education section looks pretty bad now... Shit. If I fix it now it will skew the data, but without that question the data is skewed... I vaguely remember in the past that if I add another answer to that question that it might delete the current pie chart in the results which would make it look very strange to everyone reviewing the survey... Crap, I can't believe I messed that one up.
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:25:18
Yea and DOGE has been traded more readily than BTC, the article makes it seem like BTC moves more coin. Nothing against BTC at all, just this article has a clear bias and is not based on fact, just hope.

Do you remember that rant blog he made then posted on I commented on what a fucking moron the dude was for talking like that as the CEO of a company and most of the members defended him (shocker) that's when I packed my bags and stopped reading their bullshit.
I liked the community, but they were and are still way too enthusiastic about bullshit. It's like a giant cult of delusion where the winner is whoever can down the most koolaid the fastest. You try and talk reason and they just scream at you. Glad I moved my coin to BTC before they became even more worthless.
Anyone happen to have a link to that rant? I've been wanting to repost that ever since I heard the "news" that he turned out to be a scammer.
You know there are posts on saying things like "who cares about the whole moolah thing" as if it's not a big deal they all for ripped off.

I've been watching BTC for a few years on and off. I got into Doge for a bit, still have a lot of coin. I'm considering diversifying into both. Came to check back in on and was unsure what to think. Everyone is just telling each other to eat shit and die from the looks of it.

I love how you act as if I just insulted him. I gave him some of my coin to be nice, that was all. I didn't say fuck bitcoin leave it. I'm subbed to both BTC and DOGE, we're not at war with one another as it seems you think we are, so chill out.

For only 2 upvotes and 12 mintues I'd say (it's now at 4) is a great start.
I've done some surveys like this on (135 responses) and (920 responses) with some good success, just takes some visibility and time. 
If you didn't already do so, could you toss it an up vote to help get some eyes on it? Thanks!

I won't, at least I don't see hot it can. They have to cover their overhead. They can't run a charity. From a business perspective, I understand the want to keep things fee free to make consumers happy, but I think both parties have to wake up and realize that if a company is going to provide a service, they have to make money somehow. The servers cost money. The office space costs money. The developers cost money. The management costs money. The lighting to work in the office costs money. These are all overhead that has to be paid for, and you can't pay for them with good will and a pat on the back.
I'd love to see their business plan, because if they only plan to have no fee's for a year then in a year they're going to piss of their base. That sort of model will encourage others to do the same 'No fee' approach for a while, which will result in a giant race to the bottom akin to the daily deal business. The price of photobooks tanked and it cost businesses more money to make them then they brought it. Hundreds of companies went under because of the race to the bottom.
Edit: yes they are going to have "fair remittance fees," which should be expected, but they're going to have a lot of overhead to cover and they only seem to have one source to cover it so I'd like to see how fair the fees will be. We'll see soon I guess.
