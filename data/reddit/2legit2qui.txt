Yes, I reduced the price and didn't realize I needed to generate a new link. I mistakenly thought bitpay managed the price change on their end. Thanks for the heads up.  
*EDIT: Apparently I was deleting whitespace that corresponded to the button linking. It was not a BitPay issue.*

Can't believe I skipped over that (Fixed now for both BTC and USD).  Thanks!

I will do some conversions of my photos soon. Thanks for the tip!

Noted. Admittedly I tried via a homemade lightbox but I could use more practice, or maybe I should look into a professional soon. Thanks for the feedback.

I have seen some people do this with cnc machines and metal for keychains and such... very cool idea. For me, I like sticking to 100% handmade... and my hands aren't that steady, haha.

That's a good idea. Thanks!

I forgot to post the measurements you asked. 
Measurements (inches): 3.75h x 2.75w x 0.15d.
The site now also includes this :)

Thanks for the purchase and great feedback.  
  -The BitPay all-in-one cart system doesn't seem to have non-mandatory or drop down options. Other systems that I have worked with do, but I will look into BitPay first. I may need to integrate a custom order field with a BitPay post request. I agree that it needs to get easier(dropdowns are ideal)  
 - I will be scaling down the pics to jpg, it seems multiple users have had the same experience (too HighRes).  
 - I will add labeled images for each option to give users a better understanding of their custom wallet. Something like a sample image palatte for each feature.  
 - I have redirected the URL, that past one is another site I am creating to sell not wallet accessories (backpacks and such). That site is under construction.  
Thanks again!
