I've got 99 problems but a spork ain't one!

Maybe they don't want the NSA snooping in on their conversation? ;-)

I hear money can be used to buy drugs too.  Are you allowed to talk about that?

FTFY ;)
... not that I want to jinx you, of course!

Anyone have a link to a full-size version of the infographic at the top of the petition?

Nevermind. The [Confirmation wiki page]( (and attached PDF re double spending) cleared up my confusion.

I'm fairly new to bitcoin so I apologise if this is a stupid question.
How can bitcoins be used for such a Point-of-Sale transaction given that confirmation of a transaction is not instantaneous? I know that a transaction is irreversible, but is it possible that a customer could appear to have paid but then the payment never gets through?

Google first. Stupid questions later.

Because of the address?
@_date: 2013-10-04 13:47:21
That's why I left it as a question. I'm guessing that the address, which is referred to as the address for the "Silkroad Seized Coins", is used by the government to hold the coins.
