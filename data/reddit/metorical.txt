Haha that's a good idea... I think I'll just get my next coins in cold storage so there's no button to press.

Good point, although I'm not 100% convinved that works.  I actually thought the price differences between the exchanges were fairly stable and were due to other factors e.g. Bitfinex might trail $200 but never catch up, if GDAX starts gong down, Bitfinex follows immediately to maintain that $200 spread.

I didn't mean arbitrage doesn't work, I meant that this might not be an opportunity you can take advantage of.

So how many people here are cycling through altcoins to try and ride the highs?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:19:41
1. Bought at ATH
2. Sold at actual lowest price today :(
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:25:12
Yeah, still planning to buy a handful of alts at aome point.  Need to get on a sensible exchange though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:19:27
Makes sense, I'm considering doing the same myself.  The spread (between bid/offer) is quite large on some pairs so there's potential to take consistent small gains (but risk losing on a big price swing).
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:27:56
Buying at ATH was a bit of a blunder but the plan was to hold anyway til the moon.
  
The sell was a bad decision... friends all saying to sell and I let the voices get to me... then they didn't sell themselves.
  
But really it was greed (was picking up a few hundred euros buying/selling on swing before) - really through dumb luck.

Thank you :)  I honestly expected more lols than support but it's been amazing.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:47:19
Got it, sell low, buy high... thought I was doing it backwards. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:30:38
Great, I'll check it out, thanks :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:24:31
Thanks for the support.  It's interesting to experience the feeling of loss, although slightly expensive lesson.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:23:42
So why is there a 1500 euro difference between bitfinex and gdax that isn't correcting itself?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:29:18
Hopefully next time I can post the reverse :)

Given no special/inside information:
1. When the market is going down, don't buy anticipating the up turn.
2. When the market is going up, don't sell anticipating the down turn.
  
It's a lot better to miss the best price slightly than get the worst price.
  
Following these two rules is pretty much trading 101.  It prevents you losing it all on the worldcoms/enrons/marconis etc.
If you know you're a bigger fish then the guys shorting the instrument, sure go for it, but that's because you have extra information the market doesn't have.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:45:05
This has been the worst trade deal in the history of trade deals, maybe ever
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:30:02
Thanks, feel better now I've shared!
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:23:09
Yep, fortunately money I could afford to lose.  A good lesson.  A silly gut instinct sell rather than well thought out.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:19:56
Thanks, I nearly did this over a year ago but had verification problems... epicfail... guess I need to get on bitfinex
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:08:04
I think that pretty much sums it up :)
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:32:25
Sorry to hear that.  I guess I'm just waiting for a dip to buy back now... if I buy on the up the price will tank :S or maybe not haha.  Once I'm back in it's HODL and stop worrying about day to day.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:21:48
I had 1 BTC.. lost about 6000 euros.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:16:19
It's great when you see enough momentum build up and their wall get smashed... sure they are probably only losing a few % but at least the price can move fluidly.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:01:07
Thanks for your detailed replies :) I'm still new to these markets so the more I can learn the better.
