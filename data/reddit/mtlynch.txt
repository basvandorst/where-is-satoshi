A few months ago, I wrote about my experience stealing an altcoin from a user who posted a corrupted version of their private key to reddit: ["How I Stole Your Siacoin"](

Here's the URL for anyone who was looking for it:
This is pretty interesting. I'd never heard of this before. I've used Upwork and Freelancer.com. Freelancer.com is terrible and Upwork is passable, but I'd love to see a good alternative.
I'd like for there to be a way to use it without having to install client-side Python software because it means I can't hire nontechnical people (e.g. VAs), but hopefully a hosted solution is on the roadmap.

Sorry about your bad luck with BTCJam. I think this is less about the hopelessness of p2p lending and more about BTCJam's inability to minimize the number of scammers and pursue delinquent loans. The vast majority of users at and [LendAcademy]( have had positive, competitive returns with p2p lending on sites like Lending Club and Prosper.

I'm currently reading *Founders at Work* and I was surprised at the interview with Max Levchin, co-founder of PayPal, about how close PayPal was to Bitcoin in early stages (though still not quite a currency):

Link? A few commenters have claimed this, but I haven't seen confirmation.


Yeah, agree that it's weird.
I can imagine emailing files back and forth before she learns how to use git. I did that with a friend who I was teaching to program just because I didn't want to force him to learn git on top of learning programming right at the start. But I wouldn't keep that up for 3 months because that would be a huge hassle relative to the cost of eventually teaching him basic git.

Whatever the truth is, this is a terrible write-up. I'm surprised it's getting such traction because the "evidence" against her is pretty flimsy or non-existent.






What? You can't get the git history by decrypting an app binary.
The post shows a screenshot of a private git repo's commit history but no explanation of how it was obtained.
The 16-year old girl [claims]( that the other author has a high number of commits because he was committing code on her behalf because she didn't have a Github subscription for private repos. Fishy because that's a weird workflow, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.


Maybe this is lost on me because I'm not an iOS developer, but is the author just accusing the girl of poor technique? That seems to *support* the case that she's an amateur developer.


A non-existent library created the app? What is this evidence of?


Why are we not seeing proof that this conversation occurred?


Addressing another developer as "sweetie" is deeply unprofessional. This whole sentence was dripping with obnoxious arrogance. This is the "investigator" we're taking at their word?
In case the author changes the post, this is the version that I'm commenting on:

Ah, got it. Thanks!


My understanding is still that she claims she wrote the code, but her collaborator was the one who checked it in.
Not saying that's true or untrue, but I feel like there's maybe confusion between her admitting that someone else *committed* the code vs. someone else *authored* the code.

Are you taking into account frictional losses? For example, when you buy $10 worth of BTC on Coinbase, you're paying a 1.5% fee on every purchase. It's not much in the short term, but when we're talking about compounded growth over time, 1.5% makes a huge difference.
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:59:00
Ah you're right. I was thinking about 1.5% in terms of limiting the growth rather than limiting the amount you buy.
It's equivalent to buying 98.5% as much Bitcoin each week, so you end up with 98.5% of the final value.

Excited to hear that the backend is getting a total rewrite in Go! The old version seemed to have a lot of overhead and what seemed to be concurrency problems and it didn't seem like Python was the ideal language for it. Go seems much better suited to what the backend needs.
I am a bit worried, though, because I checked out [the new repository]( and it looks like there are zero unit tests, zero tests of any kind. Is this correct? The [Python implementation]( didn't have *great* test coverage, but at least there was something there.
Where are the tests?

That's a good sentiment, but I think that's similar to saying you'd love help adding security to your system. It's really difficult for someone else to layer on test coverage after the code has been written without testability in mind. If you want to follow healthy dev practices, testing has to be a first class citizen.
