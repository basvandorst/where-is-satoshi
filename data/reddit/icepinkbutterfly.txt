So here's the story: 
My fiancee is a miner and is avid about using bitcoin to buy stuff for our hobbies. He is also an electronic cigarette enthusiast and has been extremely pleased that he has bought everything related to his e-cigs with bitcoin. Over the weekend he told me that I could use some bitcoins to buy something I wanted. I was excited but in for a major let down.
Where are the shopping options for women? It was impossible to find something on the bitcoin shopping sites that a woman would really want. Given, I am a bit of a techy, but nothing really interested me. What I really wanted was some makeup. Makeup isn't cheap, and it has been a long time since I have had the extra money to buy something new. My fiancee was very confused that I would even want more makeup, but I didn't bother trying to explain it. I simply told him I was frustrated that I couldn't find any site that had name-brand, or at least decent off-brand makeup for bitcoin. 
After a lot of searching and frustrating dead ends, I gave up. Then I sumbled upon gyft.com. With hope in my eyes, I looked for a gift card I could use on a site I knew would have the makeup I was looking for. As if hearing my pleas, gyft showed me a Sephora giftcard on the front page!!
Over-joyed, I immediately showed my fiancee. He used his bitcoin app to purchase a Sephora gift card with bitcoin on gyft. Within minutes I had Sephora credit and immediately after it I placed my order online. I ended up paying $2.48 for the makeup I bought. As a bonus, I got a ton of free samples!
TL;DR: Buy your girlfriend makeup with bitcoin using gyft.com!!!
