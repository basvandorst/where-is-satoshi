I'm being serious here: saving is a sign of inefficiency and a hedge against uncertainty, two things which many societies strive to reduce.  This might *partially* explain why savings have gone down.
And taxes are necessary, so?  Are you saying we should be able to exchange currency to be able to pay for local taxes, sorta like what we have now?  Or that we should be forced to pay taxes in bitcoin (and how would that make bitcoin any less of a monopoly)?

News flash!  college freshman invents/discovers (yet another) radical new thing that no one has ever though of before, or done.

the original article, and you, both miss the point.  You go on and on about the infrastructure/algorithm, or what you hope will eventually happen, but the *actual* argument is that bitcoin is antisocial when considering the reality of how good it is NOW at buying/selling goods, or the fact that most of it is being hoarded (hint: the point of currency is not too hoard it).
You're like the guy who goes on and on about how much better google+ is than Facebook, except, you know for the number of people using it.

Well, put.  The best aspect of bitcoin are the features that reduce exchange barriers, and make in resilient and decentralized (algorithmically).  Not the features, such as fixed quantity, that most people seem fixated over (price of Bitcoin).

I know, I'm still waiting for those cities designed around the Segueway.

lol, that's a lot of conspiracies there....  if you feel so strongly the Krugman's wrong, you should go put all your money in the Euro... or better yet Bitcoin.
