What are you talking about?  Bitcoin is dropping like a hot potato right now.

He's probably dead already so it wouldn't have mattered.  And if he's alive he'd be too old to truly enjoy his lambo anyway,
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:28:58
How is he right about "shitcoins" when more than 20 of them have gained far more than Bitcoin within this year alone?
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:52:24
Better pull out now so you can buy more at the bottom!
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:54:23
Imagine if you withdrew  after the 21k pump and bought Atoms!  You'd have 37k% gains!  Lets say you had a measly 10k in bitcoin, that would be $3,710,000.00 in Atoms.  Those are nice gains for a 12 month  investment!
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:30:34
Luckily most of the top 10 coins have stayed in the top 10 all year so the chances of picking a superior coin (in terms of gain) would be very high.  For example, EGT has been dominating for 6 months now.  For all the people that bought BTC during its initial climb to 13k, they could have easily tripled their investment by now.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:10:16
and there are alt coins that have grown 26k% in the last year!
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:21:45
Why do people care about market dominance?  Did you guys invest in the early stages or something because if you invested this year there are over 10 alt coins that completely DEMOLISHED BTC in gains this year alone.  I mean I guess if you don' care about making money and just stan BTC for the tech I could see the point of these memes, but if you are trying to get to the money there are tons of altcoin holdrs that have true bragging rights and would make you BTC stans look like welfare queens.
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:45:05
I have a feeling they are.  Literally zoom out a couple of months and all the "shitcoins" have still had massive gains.  I wish there was another forum for Vets only.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:21:42
I guess if you want to buy during an all time low this could be considered good press lol.
@_date: 2019-07-10 19:17:00
See when you do clownery
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:59:33
Well 11 is  closer to 20 than 0 lol.  And those "shitcoins" in the top 5 practically rap$d bitcoin up the arse so I don't know why people on here feel that ALL altcoin holdrs are suicidal lmao.  I guess people gotta stan for their bitcoin like people do music artists or sports teams.
@_date: 2019-07-11 07:18:51
Trust me they are, step into the altcoin forums and you will see tons of people investing in every alt coin you can think of.  Just because you didn't luck up on the 10 superior coins doesn't mean others didn't get in on the gravy train.
@_date: 2019-07-11 00:06:34
Its not cringey when you look at the context.  Do I personally think BTC is a flop...no, but this person is ready to throw in the towel just because some alt coins are dropping when in fact everything is dropping!  If she were to scroll out she would see that 11 alt coins OWNED BTC in this past year alone, and the top 5 have brutally R it up the arse with how much more they've gained in price.  People dragging altcoins are the ultimate cringe because eventually the same little drop will happen to BTC (like we are seeing now).
@_date: 2019-08-14 18:46:32
Its the same thing over here with altcoins.  You guys aren't snowflakes lol.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:49:48
BTC Dominance is only worth anything if you bought in when it was mere pennies and you held on to it.  Many people have made more money money than you with "shitcoins" so don't get too boastful.
@_date: 2019-08-09 16:54:12
Next you should look into buying alt coins while they are still having a sale.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:49:01
You should have zoomed out a bit for the total picture,, we are probably going back down to 4k.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:44:35
who cares its 50 bucks.  You can make that by watching those little videos on coinbase for free!
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:34:16
How long have you been into bitcoin because 3k isnt  an unlikely drop.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:47:19
Except it was more like a hyped up frenzy to 14k which sadly roped in all the newbies and now you guys have gone radio silent lmao!
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:36:52
This ain't no dip hunay!  Its goin back to 3k by the end of the week!
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:20:13
get money bitch!!  Don't listen to the haters, as long as you monitor everything you should definitely come out on top.
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:22:34
I want to see the people that bought at 7k and didn't sell at 21k lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:38:36
I agree, get out now and buy back in once it dips to 3k next week.  Rinse repeat.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:17:23
The bull run started around 3k so I don't we can count out a 4k correction...especially with how fast its dropping.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:30:46
Imagine if the people who bought at 15k 2 years ago sold at 21k
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:55:58
Maybe next time you won't go meme crazy during a bull run.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:00:29
Once you finish that one you should click on the "earn" tab in coinbase and you will find even more alt coin quizzes.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:33:50
lmao this is quality trolling!
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:51:32
Tell that to the people who bought in at 3k 2 yrs ago and didn't sell at the 21k  mark.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:32:32
The face when you panic buy at 11k and now you don't know if you should break even or ride till the wheels fall off.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:11:49
Then how did it happen 2 yrs ago when we reached 21k?
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:39:33
But Bitcoins aren't even in the top 10!   You  guys are just salty you weren't smart enough to get in on the cheap alt coins and REALLY cash in.
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:44:34
But litecoin is  literally shitting on bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:53:12
Don't worry, it will be back down to 3k  by next week.  Then you can buy to your hearts content.
@_date: 2019-06-23 13:15:10
But some shitcoins have increased by over 1k%
