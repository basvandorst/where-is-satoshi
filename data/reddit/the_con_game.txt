Blockchain Gold has everything Blockchain NOTHINGNESS (Bitcon) has. When you put them side by side you can see how loony bin crazy overvalued Bitcon is. One emperor has no clothes.
If the pumpers like network so much, the network of people holding gold in India and China is much bigger than the Bitcon network.

When the Millennials ask the next generation to pay one million dollars for a Bitcon, the next generation says "Screw you! You white haired old geezers are off your rocker! We are creating our own network with 10 cents per token." 
And the joke is they make a clone that is an exact copy of Bitcon by downloading the free open source code, creating their own network overnight.
The great store of value Bitcon version 1.0 dies with the previous generation (if not sooner).

It is hilarious how software programmed difficulty and contrived rarity makes people think thin air is somehow valuable.
If Bernie Madoff had chained his thin air instead of selling it as a bag of thin air, he would be worshipped like Satoshi instead of in jail.

It is a huge waste of electricity. Wasted work. Like digging a hole and filling it back up again. When a simple database ledger does the same thing.
After all that fake "mining" work, you get back thin air, unlike real mining which gets back a physical tangible asset. 
You pumpers keep pointing to fiat thin air. Again, two scams don't make a right. Your logic is astounding...
Hint: Blockchain Gold is more sound money than Blockchain NOTHINGNESS created out of thin air from running FREE open source code that any dummy can download.

If Bitcon is decentralized, how come the centralized Chinese miners control it?

@_date: 2018-03-17 05:58:45
What happens to your HODL and Lambo dreams when those big addresses start selling?
If Bitcon plunged from $19k to $6k without them selling, what will happen when they do start selling? You are not going to get a timely insider trading notice when they do, only a swan dive off a cliff, with some lemmings (HODLers) following off the cliff too.

The network isn't going to pay for all your losses.
The network effect doesn't work when everybody is tired of a thin air fad and dumping.
MySpace used to have a network effect until the network decided to switch to the next fad. Not much of a store of value when the network can switch overnight and make the pieces of thin air worthless.
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:58:11
7000 sold today. Only 152,203 more to sell.
Funny how he tries to hide his large dumps by buying tiny fractions.
And there are a lot more whales out there from the top of the Pyramid who paid ZERO for those Bitcons. Satoshi and pals must have multiple whale like wallets. 
So keep on pumping to enrich the whales.
@_date: 2018-03-15 06:31:47


You just fell for the thin air scam. But don't worry, the cash you put in goes to enrich the few people at the top of the Pyramid who paid zero cash for the vast majority of the imaginary coins.
@_date: 2018-03-20 00:59:12


All that huge electricity is wasted. A study showed one transaction can power 27 houses. Low cost transaction is a big LIE.
You can't redeem your fantasy tokens for the disappeared electricity. Like digging a hole and filling it back up again. A simple database ledger can do the same job without wasting a huge amount of electricity.
You pumpers already said the difficulty scales with the size of the network. You don't need a lot of miners. More miners only wastes more electricity. Satoshi by himself mined without any help, and got the vast majority of imaginary coins.


Bitcon is easily counterfeited. Any dummy can download the free open source code and create a Bitcon clone. Bitcon is continuously being inflated by the miners. They are creating new Bitcons as you speak. When the limit is reached and the miners are not subsidized with newly created Bitcons, you can look forward to a HUGE transaction fee. They aren't going to waste a huge amount of electricity to mine for a tiny fee without getting free Bitcons.


Just look at the 1500+ created cryptos. A lot of them have Billion dollar market cap and hundreds of million market cap. 
Why do you think there are so many ICOs?
It is because cryptos are so easily created.
All the cryptos are loony bin crazy overvalued when they are so easily created.
@_date: 2018-03-16 19:08:10
Agreed, pieces of paper are contrived rarity too.

Don't worry, the great network effect will reimburse you for all your losses. Bitcon is backed by the network.
Oh wait, the network is too busy dumping and laughs in your face when you request a reimbursement. So much for Bitcon being backed by the network.

Two scams don't make a right.
Fiat is required to be used by law. You have to use it to pay your taxes and most everything. Bitcon is a con that enriches the few who paid nothing for it.
Instead of pumping another thin air scam to replace the old fiat thin air scam, you should be promoting Blockchain Gold.
Much better than Blockchain NOTHINGNESS.

Put a Bitcon in your hand. You can't see it. Despite all the drawings of a gold coin in Bitcon articles trying to fool people. It is a gold coin wannabe.

Bitcon is very simply valued. Its true value is what it is backed by: Nothing. Simply a chain of nothingness. All imaginary coins.
No, it is not backed by scarce rare math. The pumpers want to fool you into believing math can become extinct. And no, it is not backed by the network. The network will not reimburse all your losses.
It will have fundamentals when it is backed by something real like commodities and gold instead of thin air NOTHINGNESS.
Bernie Madoff might not be in jail if he had chained his NOTHINGNESS.

That is what you are wishing for. Others say it is a virtual token scam that can be easily replicated infinitely. By that standard, Bitcon is insanely loony bin overvalued when a new Billion dollar crypto can be instantly created overnight. A Blockchain of NOTHINGNESS is USELESS for storing value.

You have it reversed. It is a get rich quick scheme disguised as sound money. 
Get rich quick schemes can't be sound money. Not when a few people at the top of the Pyramid like Satoshi and pals make the vast majority of the money putting in ZERO dollars, while the greater fools at the bottom of the Pyramid pay their life savings to buy a tiny fraction of an imaginary coin.

HODL was invented to make the sheep buy at exorbitantly high prices and hold while the people at the top of the Pyramid who paid nothing for Bitcon cash out. It is the same for every thin air scam.

@_date: 2018-03-15 07:18:33
Bitcon is a store of value, so there is no need to diversify.
Bitcon stores a valuable chain of NOTHINGNESS, the exact same NOTHINGNESS Bernie Madoff was selling. You can sleep safe at night knowing that you have a store of value. If the worst happens, the network effect promises to reimburse you for all your losses.
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:38:52
The main argument of the crypto pumpers to fool people into buying thin air was pointing at the rising price. Now that it is dropping, there is no more fear of missing out FOMO. FOMO is getting replaced by FOLM now (Fear of Losing Money).

Look at the Google search chart. Google search for Bitcon has been plunging since Dec. People have lost interest. Looking for the next fad.
The pumpers can't point to the rising share price anymore to fool people into buying thin air. There is no FOMO anymore when the price is dropping. The thin air fad is over. Last one out turn off the lights.

That says it all, Bitcon is a programmed Pyramid Scheme. The top of the Pyramid get the vast majority of the imaginary coins, while the suckers at the bottom of the Pyramid pay exorbitant prices for a tiny fraction of thin air.
