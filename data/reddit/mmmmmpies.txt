I am big holder for XRB and was hit lightly during this bloodbath.  I agree with above.  Do your research and ask questions.   Ignore the herd mentality.  I went all alt coins because BTC has too many holes.  
IOTA, POWR, XRP, REQ, and many others are utilizing block technology.

I will leave this here
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:15:32
Look into Raiblocks or XRB.  Fast transactions and no fees.  We didn’t get hit pretty hard during this massacre.  Want proof?  Head over to Raiblocks section.  They just did AMA with the founder the other day.  And I will leave this video here because it won me over.   If it has IOTA market cap, its looking at 80 per coin.  
 
But either way, its a market correction.  Few times this year.  You should hold down to ur investments because it will rebound quickly in a week.  You can look at the previous dips for reference.

Correct.  Women’s mindset is short to midterm.  Spend the money now to impress other women.   Men’s mindset is midterm to longterm.  They are willing to invest in risker investments but frugal with money.  That is why u see less women in crypto.  Gtfo with ur shit articles.   Underrepresented bullshit.      Women rather spend their money on latest purses and shoes than longterm investments.

Funny how the timing coincides with Mitt Romney in  2012 when everyone thought he was going to win.  I bet she was going to blame him if he won, since he didn’t, kept it as insurance policy.   Ford can’t even remember the house, date of the incident nor where it happened.  But she sure can remember 4 names of people that was there.  Or was it now 6 people.   Still refuses to testify under oath because lying under oath would be illegal.   It’s a hit job.  Feinstein held it since July.   Why didn’t she bring it up until the confirmation is finished and ready for a vote.  That’s right.  Delay delay delay.  All the way til past mid elections and hopefully if Democrats pick up more seats and derail him.   Democrats playbook.  Call everyone rapists or nazis.   Funny how Ford deleted all of her social media and even her high school online year books mysteriously deleted.   Showed lot of minors binge drinking,  uncontrollable parties, bragging about passing out... in a freaking yearbook.   Out in the open money laundering.  Raised 170k for security detail on gofundme and should expect a book deal.  Riiiight.   No evidence to back it up but its gold for democrats.  Resist anything Trump right? 
Democrats and liberals are getting played.   Women are 100% truthful right?   Believe all their rape accusations?  Should read up on mattress girl or that Asia Argento.  Started that Metoo movement by sleeping with Weinstein for movie roles.  Or casting couch.   She got busted instead for sleeping with a 17 yr old.  More men are waking up to these bullshit accusations.  I wonder why marriage rates been tanking.   Look up no fault divorce rapes.   Women can sleep around and cheat on you, file for divorce... get your house, half of everything and alimony with child support til the kids are 18.   Very dangerous precedent.  Taking just a word from a accuser with no evidence that happened decades ago as fact.   Guilty until proven innocent?  How can you prove you didn’t do it? 
You really want to know what fake accuser Ford was like in High School?   They scrubbed the yearbooks online but luckily someone saved it.

Very true.  China right now is very scary with their pending housing bubble.   The whole world was in a recession in 2008.  China housing bubble never popped.  Was pushing 20% growth every year.  The housing market was 50% of their growth.  ��.  Hundreds of these empty cities scattered all of the country.
Imaging if the couple makes 6-8k a year and buying up property with nothing in there.  No kitchen, no toilets, bathrooms, no wiring.   Nothing for 150k. Sad thing is that the apartments and homes are already falling apart within few years.   No way they can pay off the loans.  Lot of their growth is faked.

Uncontrolled illegal migration is unsustainable.  Think about it.  All the low income housings are taken up.   So no more affordable housing to build a family.  Schools are full of kids.  More kids per teacher ratio goes up.  Property taxes goes up every year to pay for all this.   Good luck trying to get that starter home.   Crime is going up because anyone can sneak in.  Drugs flowing into the US easily.  Illegal immigrants tend to vote majority Democrats.  Gee I wonder why Democrats pushing pretty hard for open borders.   Give out free entitlements.  Free college, education, medicare, medicaid, housing subsidies, etc.   They also endorsing felons to vote and lowering voting age to 16.   Crazy.   Clown world.   Done arguing.
