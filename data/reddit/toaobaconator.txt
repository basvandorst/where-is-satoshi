why all the hate - there will be times when alts (and also bch) will rise again most likely - this stuff here doesnt help anyone. Just let them be and let time decide. At the moment its just all pumping into BTC - this wont last forever - and then?
Stupid community sometimes
Btw i didnt hold any bch nor do i care about them. If they are any good they will stay anyways - if not they wont. But atm its just btc getting much attention - nothing more

Pls do a close research and find that only those who got you buy in profit from thsi ponzi scheme. Crypto is way more that affiliate marketing \(multi level marketing\) that abuses bitcoin as a vehicle. Bitclub is not more, not less.
You are better off investing straight into BTC instead of paying their pyramid

Well, at some point banks will offer services for crypto assets and get their part of the pie if crypto gets a thing. I can imagine some wallets that are covered by some insurance so if you dont want to keep responsible for your stuff all the time. could work out as a business... lets see, they keep watching the market

In the end he is rigth - if BTC will do what its about to do, the dollar will get another meaning in the world and the US will loose power - nothing they can handle very well tbh

why selling today after 2 days of massive bleed? Likely they will recover now and you fomo buy less coins for the btc you just gaines the next days :(
