What rant? You're talking about the constructive article he wrote outlining his perspective? Cover up your bias is showing.
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:53:14
Yeah, it's a scary situation.
@_date: 2018-09-22 02:42:36
Alex Jones may launch a new Bitcoin boom if they keep banning him everywhere.
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:31:09
1. There is a BTC donation address in the article
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:54:58
By that logic you'd call BTC a scam coin. Are you insane?
@_date: 2018-09-23 15:47:37
That's great, let's not help out devs who find the most serious bugs ever because they are mean. That'll encourage future devs to totally make sure they'll report them knowing they'll get adequate compensation...
@_date: 2018-09-23 20:26:50
Are you illiterate? There is a BTC address in the article right under the BCH one.
@_date: 2018-09-24 19:03:08
Again, if you read the article there is a bitcoin address that he includes. If all your taking from the article is that it's political then you should try to understand how serious an issue it is and that his disclosure of the bug means.
@_date: 2018-09-22 18:59:05
So the Bitcoin Core devs are paying him in BCH? He also included a bitcoin address when he sent it.
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:07:22
Yes there is you have no idea what your talking about.
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:34:08
That's what I've seen a lot of in this thread. People who perceive others in the crypto community as enemies and won't support developers who find 0-day bugs just because they have a differing viewpoint.
@_date: 2018-09-23 05:29:03
Not enough clearly /s
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:03:57
As long as you keep referring to them as "scamcoins" and not "The Competition" and this mindset is held amongst the community. Bitcoin will never win the coin race. But no one wants to have an honest discussion on it. They just preach Hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-31 20:54:30
Again, your mind set of calling any coin a "scam coin" when it isn't is the problem.
@_date: 2018-09-23 01:08:11
The politics of the situation are important. If you read his post and you took away anything other than "The community has areas it needs to improve in" then you're missing the point.
@_date: 2018-08-03 11:16:14


I'm confused though. If they are competing with a fork which is how you compete when you disagree with what the direction a crypto is going then how does that automatically make it a scam. Aren't they as legitimate as any other crypto?
@_date: 2018-08-07 06:27:08
It's not so much this particular site so much as it's the general attitude of the Bitcoin supporters in this sub reddit. Bcash seems to be the only alt coin that they treat with such disdain and it's causing conflict in the crypto sphere where we should all be united and pushing the same technology.
@_date: 2018-08-07 03:40:21
Wow, this is such a bad move on Bitcoins part. I found out about bitcoin through bitcoin.com. Label it a scam and new people will associate that with bitcoin. Nice job everyone. Let your hatred of Bcash blind you to sabotaging everything we've worked for. You're alienating everyone and setting the community back years thanks to this nonsense.

This is bullish? $10,000 in bitcoin each week is a drop in the bucket. It's literally 500,000 dollars a year. Which seems like a lot but is inconsequential given how much the price of bitcoin moves every day. Jack has enough money to buy 100x that amount every day if he really thought it would be benefitial.
Think about it, he'll have amassed only 128 bitcoin by the end of the year if the price stays the same. And even less if the price goes up.

It's tether, everyone's bailing out of tether. It's going to lead to a huge spike for bitcoin and other coins as people bail but expect a hard crash right after when all the tether people are holding is deemed as worthless which will be a huge loss of value in the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:14:29
Tether is causing the BTC price to rise. People are selling tether for BTC to escape tether cause they don't think it's safe. BTC rising has never affected tether before like this.
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:25:26
Ok NPC, set a remind me for a week and we can see if your programming has buckled or not.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:30:48
Ok NPC, your clearly not paying attention. Tether is a shitcoin because it's "supposedly" backed by nothing. And there isn't enough TUSD or DAI for all of tether people to dump into without paying a heavy premium.
The simple fact is if tether crashes the price of BTC will spike shortly before it crashes suddenly as all the value of tether is evaporated overnight.

It's not though... compared to a credit card Bitcoin is inconveinient. Even BCH is inconvienent. Until these things are addressed Bitcoin is going to have a problem.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:40:32
Still not good enough. Bring it down to &lt;$0.25 and then it'll be usable for small transactions. Best of all would be 1 cent or less fees.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:42:54
Wouldn't we prefer bitcoin with low fees too bitcoin with super high fees? Considering it is achievable to have super low fees with BTC why aren't we doing this yet?
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:21:39
I feel bad for you :(
