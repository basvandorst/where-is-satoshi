Question:  What currencies are available?  It only looks like they have Bitcoin and Ethereum.

Please donate towards groups like [Khan Academy]( that are revolutionizing education.  Having better, cheaper, scalable education is needed to solve all problems.

They have some of the best talent, have high quality content, use data driven iteration and feedback, name recognition, and it's starting to be adopted in classrooms across the US.  They're probably not the best at everything and I wouldn't discourage if he wanted to donate to other similar causes.  They are kind of like Bitcoin as others mentioned, they are in the best position to revolutionize education.  Their success will only help all similar education platforms and organizations. Like the better Bitcoin does, the more people will adopt other crypto currencies and block chain tech.  
I may be biased but I don't know of an org with more potential or better return on investment than Khan Academy in education.  If there is a better one, then donate to that.

Question:  I've bought a good deal of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin from Gdax and Coinbase and have it stored on my Trezor wallet.  Is there a way I could quickly transfer my coins to an exchange and trade for US $?  Coinbase's maximum daily transfer limit is $10k.  
I have faith in the future of crypto but would like to be prepared for a worst case bubble bursting scenario.
