The cryptocurrency market has lost $340 billion of value since the start of January, with a severe sell-off on Tuesday and Wednesday. Analysts are variously blaming: concerns about regulation, light trading volumes in Asia, bitcoin futures, and an unsustainable price run-up.

Tether, the issuer of the dollar-pegged cryptocurrency USDT, said its relationship with audit firm Friedman LLP has ended.
@_date: 2018-01-28 06:12:13
We confirm that the relationship with Friedman is dissolved.  Given the excruciatingly detailed procedures Friedman was undertaking for the relatively simple balance sheet of Tether, it became clear that an audit would be unattainable in a reasonable time frame. As Tether is the first company in the space to undergo this process and pursue this level of transparency, there is no precedent set to guide the process nor any benchmark against which to measure its success.

A lot has been happening in the crypto world this week. Let’s start talking Bitcoin is facing resistance at the down trendline one. If the bulls succeed in breaking out of this resistance, we can expect a rally towards the down trendline two. Aggressive traders can trade this pullback. We’re on a downward trend, but there’s heavy potential after the bad news to watch it go higher as the ecosystem continues to price.

I'm starting to not like this shill. We have not adopted SegWit because WE DO NOT WANT TO USE SEGWIT! We blame the devs because WE NEED MORE BLOCKSPACE! More txs are happening every 10 minutes than we have blockspace for asshole! I won't use SegWit even if they manage to force CoinBase to capitulate. As a matter of fact, if CoinBase tries to force me to use ShitWit, I will use another exchange.﻿

You've been told Segwit is optional. And for non-mining nodes it is, just like for SPV nodes the block size is not enforced. For mining nodes (the only truly full node), Segwit enforcement is not optional.
