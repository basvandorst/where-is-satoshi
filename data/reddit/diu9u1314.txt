Honestly, who knows. Right now, people are saying that the bull market is over because the price dropped over 30%. When the price starts going up again, the sentiment will once again change. It's unpredictable.

Yep, just remember to increment your stop loss in the event things go south.

Pretty sure you only have to pay if you sell and pocket that $2. You won't have to pay taxes if you don't sell.

Really. So why didn't we go to 400 in 2018?

Lmao, you're a tool. Not sure where your comment went, but why are you getting defensive? As I have said, I am pro bitcoin. You probably don't know the answer yourself. I never said I didn't have an idea; I am just curious about yours. Turns out you're just another sheep. Simmer down.
And let me break it down for you, since you claim to know it all. The guy is pro block chain, not pro bitcoin. He is interested in the technology. Even more so as to why this doesn’t mean China is pro bitcoin is the fact that they are building up their own currency. Why would they be pro something they can’t control? Now this doesn’t mean that this is bad news, but I’m just educating your delusional ass. Don’t go after someone for calling your sheep ass out.

Man I really wish the prophecy comes true, but at this rate, doesn’t seem like it’s gonna happen with 3 days left. If the prophecy does come true, Im going all in

Hm ok, I am bullish, but the president said blockchain -- not bitcoin. So please explain.

Doubt it. BTC was way overbought at that point. BTC had gone up for 9 consecutive days, and yesterday, it blew past 11.12. and 13 almost. It was bound to drop. Technically, we still aren't at a lost because prior to the price hike, it was still trading around 10k and 11k.

lmaooooo, you can't be serious if you think any one person can give you a definite answer. But to say the least, if it goes from 11k to 14k in one day, it's bound to drop.  By how much? Nobody knows, but it's almost guaranteed to pull back.  
  
As far as 100k to a million, only time will tell. Nobody really knows.
