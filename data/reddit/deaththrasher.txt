I imagine her standing at the frontdoor of the Bitcoin rabbit hole ( called white paper), trying to understand a single bloody sentence...
When she says she will "look", that means, that she already asked some expert (who doesn't understand Bitcoin at all), who told her, that Bitcoin is used by criminals and that they need a regulation for that.
edit: maybe she 
@_date: 2018-01-23 08:20:19
Still the price won't go up. Possible that Korea FUD wasn't the reason for the drop?
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:29:45
Maybe start to get in with low % of your bankroll at 7k to spread. Depending on what happens until this dump, like price tops ath significantly, I would even get in at 8k - 10k.
If I hadn't invested long time, I would get in now, knowing the risk of losing more than 50% of my stack is very low and even then I could hold it and buy even more.

Name any big number in the range of sandgrains on earth, convert it into a Bitcoin address and you can transfer value to this address and spend it any time you want to any place you want and no one can take it from you. Amazing, huh?

I bought at 5000-3500 and sold at 7000-13000. Going to buy back when it goes lower than 6000. I'm glad. Holidays are paid already.

It's as easy as any exchange only that you don't need to go through a verification process.
@_date: 2019-07-20 10:22:54
Everything you wrote is known to me, though your calculations are based on today's price, which I think is wrong. Every halving leads to a basic problem for the miners: Is it still profitable for me to mine half of the reward at this price? Either the price goes up or the machines turn down. This will be reflecting in the total hashrate, mining difficulty and the price. As you said, more adaption will lead to price stability and what also may happen at this time is, that goods will directly be priced in Bitcoin instead of a national currency.
At that time we might need a fully new taxation system to hold up our infrastructure.

Is there a gun pointing to him while he says that?
@_date: 2019-07-07 10:24:57
I am trading on Bisq on a regular basis. Works very nice. The bottleneck here is bank deposits. You have to deal with the price fluctuations, because the international bank deposit can take up to 4-5 days. I prefer trading with peers that have a bank in my country.
Never traded F2F(facetoface), but there are situations, where I certainly would.
@_date: 2019-07-06 08:23:54
I heard, some cool early Bitcoin miner wanted to make clear, that CSW is not Satoshi Nakamoto and is paying the Kleiman lawyer.
@_date: 2019-07-20 11:47:41
All this leads to volatility until that very point of equilibrium is reached. Price will go up in the long run and will oscillate around that line of profitability. If you know the average price to mine 1 Bitcoin, you will have a basic idea for a lowest possible price at a certain time.
@_date: 2019-07-19 05:23:40
If you are using a shitty wallet, you can export your private keys from this wallet to a better one, that allows low fees.

@_date: 2019-07-20 15:53:53
Not a common fallacy and not a fallacy at all. History has shown this exact pattern and it will continue to do so for a while until it reached this equilibrium we both are talking about. I will be there at the next dump buying and sell maybe 80% with a 2x or 3x profit again. Dunno what you will be doing. Probably discussing the impossibility of knowing about the price of Bitcoin and missing your chances to stack some Satoshis, like some of the people I told about Bitcoins potential to disrupt the way we treat money and they didn't buy at 100$ nor at 1000$. Some of them came back at a price of 18k, where I told them not to buy, because the price was way to high back then.
If it goes up to like 25k or more and dumps afterwards, 7-8k is a strong buy and &lt;6k is a take-a-credit-to-buy-and-pay-it-back-in-a-few-month.

Well explained. Also the bottlenecks and risks in decentralized trading are only the centralized payment systems. 
Btw: BISQ offers F2F (face to face) trading.
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:52:03
OK. Just remember my answers, when the time has come and put some fresh fiat on the table. No need to sell your holdings. I upstock my offline wallet with some of my profits in Bitcoin. Just as I mentioned earlier: I have Bitcoins that are sitting in a wallet for hodl and I have fiat to invest at low prices, which I sell later with profit.
@_date: 2019-07-29 09:12:50
Not if the consent is, that taxation has to be paid. If people live in a democracy, they are free to vote for a tax free party. You don't do it, then you agree with the majority/consense.

I had some serious fun with the nigerian prince. Made like I was interested in this and I was letting him call me several times and holded him on the phone while doing other things. After like 3 times, he found out that I was scamming him out of his telephone bill and never called again.

What are you doing at a Bitcoin sub, when you can't even do simple math? Now go back to your 'please don't talk to me' school buddies. Have nice day!
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:19:44
If it doesn't, my long term hodl wallet will be looking very beautiful. I don't care if the price goes up or down. I just act accordingly. Buy low and sell high and save some of my profits.
Also if people put their money on some advice of a random internet stranger instead of investing in their own knowledge, they deserve to lose. If you heard something fascinating about Bitcoin, check for yourself if it is true or not.
Bitcoin would be pretty predictable for you too, if you invested some time to learn about it.
It is pretty clear, that Bitcoin will not go lower than 5000 (esp after the next halvening), which makes it a perfect investment even now at 11k. You can lose about half of your money if you panic sell at 6k, but you can 4-5 fold within a year if you make it to sell the on the tip of the next pump.
@_date: 2019-07-31 09:50:17

Btw, also mixed coins can be tracked. Exchanges can freeze accounts and they can also be tracked.
I would say, that using Bitcoins is the best way to get caught actually.
Criminals should stick to cash.

In my opinion 'normal' people would give their vote for somebody, who gives them freedom and peace instead of banning numbers.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:11:38
Yeah. It's like arguing that one could buy drugs with Bitcoin or Bitcoin is used by criminals.
@_date: 2019-07-20 08:51:23
All this might be valid for regular trading, but with Bitcoin you are playing with a completely different technology. 
* 1. Huge decentralized worldwide network
* 2. Guaranteed limited supply to 21Mio
* 3. Open Source
* 4. Secured by science
* 5. Useful and faster than traditional forms of payment systems
* 6. Any number can be a Bitcoin Private Key and you can store value behind it
... and there is a lot more that is new.
I bought my first Bitcoins in 2013 at about 100$. I did, because I thought, that this code/technology is revolutionary and it might have the potential to be used everywhere.
I was right and many of the guys I tried to explain about the potential of Bitcoins didn't want to understand and they were wrong.
Think about the halvening process (next one is not a year away) and imagine what this means for the miners, the supply and the price. Volatility btw is part of the game and it will still be for a long time until like 2140, when all miners do it for the fees only and price will stabilize.

Ehm.. what happens with these unconfirmed addresses if I find one of those keys bfore they are confirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:18:12
So you deposit BTC to an exchange and buy Monero.
If your BTC goes to a known exchange address, they can freeze your account and answer to any subpoena with logfiles.
You probably better could get the ransom directly in Monero. That might work.
@_date: 2018-09-20 15:13:55
Even when the mempool was spammed, the fees were actually a lot lower than people thought. Instead of trying a transaction for real, they kept repeating other peoples FUD.

The energy to sustain the Bitcoin network has a value, that is obviously less than the return. If not, miners would shut down operations.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:46:21
Points more in direction Dave Kleiman beeing the coder and Faketoshi beeing the investor only, who never had control over those 1 Mio Bitcoins. And even this story i will only believe when actual proof is presented.
If Craig would be able to sign the very well known GPG key or move some specific also very well known early coins, he would have done already to stop this discussion.

You tried quite the same analogy again, only this time with gold instead of water. What you don't seem to understand is that LE has a lot more tools available, than your forensic shop. There are a lot of examples, where LE cracked the anonymity of tumblers, which led to the arrest of the criminals behind it. Search for 'Welcome to Video' or read papers/articles like these ones:

It's not! It only takes a few minutes longer to trace. Computers can do the tracing relatively quick, especially when criminals try to tumble big amounts.
@_date: 2019-11-19 09:27:14
With small amounts, you can give them brainwallets, that are not made of known sentences, like 'to be or not to be'. Instead, put their name, their date of birth and a nice sentence, together with a manual how to convert.
i.e. 'CalvinHoppersted04202001HappyBirthdayYouSonofAGun'  
Sidenote: This is definitely not good for big amounts.

@_date: 2019-11-13 04:42:35
Take 1500BTC and try to tumble it without a trace and then trade it for fiat on coinbase and you will see how easy it is to trace it back to the original wallet.

Bitcoin technology was working before Ross has heard of it. Lets be real.

Probably not. Get your money out of the bank and buy Bitcoin here: [ or use Bisq 
@_date: 2019-11-01 11:39:01
Depends on where you live, you might want to try localbitcoins 
If you have a friend who has some Bitcoins, you can trade a small amount with him/her.
There are platforms where you can work for Bitcoins. I did some translation jobs, where I earned my wage in Bitcoins.
Here are some untested links 
 
If you don't find anything that fits, then you might need to register at a trading platform like coinbase, poloniex etc
Edit: You can also use openbazaar to sell things for Bitcoins.
btw, There are scammers on the internet, so watch out!

No I can't, because I have no motivation to do that. Also I would not be able to order subpoenas to exchanges and businesses. LE can do that and they are becoming more and more successful in tracing. Remember: the blockchain never forgets.

How can we know the '0' is not an 'O'
This is esp tricky because there are no 0s or Os used in Bitcoin addresses exactly for this reason.
You scan quality makes it difficult to distinct between certain fields, which makes counting fields senseless.

Great puzzle for people with a lot of time. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-11-14 10:08:50
I agree with you when it comes to small amounts mixing with small amounts, but if you try to tumble 1500BTC in a pool of small amounts, it will be much easier to detect. Especially after joining the BTC again to send it to an exchange with KYC. Your analogy with the ocean is weak, because you can't use a computer to do the work, while blockchain analyzis is easy to do with even using simple manual commands, like cat |grep. LE has programs to follow the money.
@_date: 2018-10-02 13:48:11

You dont need to 'cash out' in the first place. There are a lot of advantages, when keeping your Bitcoins.
1. Your bank can close your account and you still have your Bitcoins.
2. You can buy goods with Bitcoins, without the bank as a middleman
3. You can transfer Bitcoins worldwide, paying a very low fee
4. You can use it as an investement, hoping for higher BTC prices in the future, while the USD (and all other FIAT currencies) only knows one direction: Down (Inflation)
5. You can use BTC worldwide without the need to exchange it to local currency
@_date: 2018-10-11 13:51:29

@_date: 2018-10-04 13:59:18
People will put any hash of data they found in this field, because nobody knows what needs to be hashed. If somebody found a private key, he would not need to send a hash anyway, because he knows, that he has found the right answer and you will know because the found amount will be sent to another address. So you are expecting people to hash the private key just to inform you, that somebody has found it?
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:26:34
Exchanges tend to have higher BTC prices, when users have difficulties to withdrawal in FIAT.

I tried some gimmicks with GIMP and steghide and didn't find anything in the image. The numbers in the field can't be part of the private key due to the zeros. It also can't be part of a HEX code (letters like L and K)

@_date: 2019-10-29 14:00:55
What do you mean with client?
I buy and sell at Bisq  
You will need a small amount of BTC to start trading though
(There’s just one more thing to do before we can trade with Bisq: we need to send enough bitcoin to our Bisq wallet to cover a security deposit as well as trading and mining fees.
Security deposits help prevent fraud, so Bisq requires both buyers and sellers to post one (in bitcoin) for every trade. On the buyer’s side, this is usually 10% of the trade amount.)
Edit: The security deposit returns to your wallet after trading
If you have a small amount, then you can start trading within minutes.
To store my BTC I use Electrum, which is the best for day to day using.
For my offline wallet (long term hodl) I use Bitcoin Core (without downloading the entire Blockchain)

You mean wait for the next drop to 5k because you missed buying at 7,4k? Or you mean buying now at 9.5k?  
If I'd buy now, I would only do it to hold for a year or longer. I think 25k is possible within a year. If it would drop significantly (like &lt; 7k) after a buy at 9.5k, I would buy more. Panic selling is no option for me.

Halving was intentionally coded and has nothing to do with BTC raising from 11k to 19k in 15 days, just because it already happened before.
It could easily drop to 2500$ and then jump up to 30000$. Noone can predict that.
I agree with you, that in the long run the Bitcoin protocol could get you a very high ROI, but it's still too early to know if this experiment will be a success. It could fail at any given time and price could fall under a dollar.

I answered to this main thread with 'Be your own bank' and you directed to me, that 'average human on this planet is not willing nor capable of securing Bitcoins properly', which is utter bs.  
I AM an average guy and I CAN secure Bitcoins properly and I KNOW a lot of avarage human beings, that can store their Bitcoins properly. If you would start to read AND understand, you would've understood my answer already, but no. You as a self-claimed 'over-average' human can't even follow a simple discussion.

The 5 figures bug ...
@_date: 2019-12-01 14:21:50
I only said that Bitcoin was invented to be  'A purely peer-to-peer   version of electronic cash would allow onlinepayments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.'
Nothing more and nothing less. If you don't get it, its ok with me.
I am into Bitcoin since 2013. Bought for 100$/BTC and I learned a lot about it in these years. Yes I am an still the average guy and neverless I know how to store my Bitcoins properly, which makes all of your statements simply false and arrogant. In contrast to you, I don't think I am special just because I know how Bitcoin works.
My question to you was rather rethorical, because only a person who thinks who is better than others ('above average') can write this type of arrogant statements like you do.
Again: Average people can very well store their Bitcoins secure and use it in a way, that makes it different from existing payment and storing solutions, like fiat in regular banks or even PayPal. The fantastic thing about Bitcoin is NOT that you can store it in your bank account, like you could do it with fiat for a lot of decades before already, but that you can be your own bank! It is not in any way a religious issue, like you in your arrogant way tried to imply, but it is about financial independency for the people.
Bitcoins main features are: decentralised, open-source, peer to peer. Nothing that I would imply as features of a bank.
If you use Bitcoins in a bank, you are giving all of these features away from you to centralized, non p2p and closed source bank, that can close the doors any day and not give you your money back, even not your Bitcoins, because you don't posess the private keys.
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:27:34
Still you could call it something else. Fork Bitcoin and call it Lazycoin, Copycoin, Whinerscoin, Jesuscoin or whatever. Calling it BitcoinXXX makes them always look frustrated of not beeing able to make part of the real Bitcoin development. But they want to call themselves 'Bitcoin Dev' if you ask them what they do for a living.

There was a guy at bitcointalk who claimed he has found the hacker, like within a few hours after Theymos has posted, that he has recieved an email from the original email account of SN. He was praised as the new super hacking detective by a lot of people, but he was pretty quiet the following days and the Bounty is still there and the GMX account has beeing closed. We don't know how much information the hacker was able to squeeze out of Satoshis emails in the end.

I know that only using the word "Silk Road" brings bad publicity to the OB project, but I guess we have to live with that. People will definitely find a way to sell whatever they want on OB. They will also find a way to anonymize their connections and mix their coins. OB will be used, just like Bitcoin or cash, for good and also for bad things. There is nothing wrong with it.
@_date: 2016-02-20 09:03:40
OB is not working like torrent. The shops are not distributed to the whole world, simply by uploading. You need to put your shop on a webserver, which can be closed down of course. And when the shop is down, it is not available any more unlike torrent.

I think it doesn't matter, because the cost to accept BTC is very low (Zero if you want) and overseas transfer is a lot quicker and cheaper than traditional banking. So it doesn't matter if you have only 1 customer paying with BTC or thousands.

I didn't say, that he didn't contribute to Bitcoins success (which btw other people did too - and earlier than Ross), but I would not go as far as Ross beeing Bitcoins father, which is what Ross really seems to believe (and you too). Bitcoins success didn't come because an online drug lord used Bitcoin for payments, but because the Bitcoin code made him able to do exactly that. Other people have found this out long before Ross, as you can easily verify on the blockchain and Bitcoin forums. Bitcoin certainly would have had success without Ross, because the idea of Satoshi is revolutionary and not a drug dealers, who just understood this.

 Posted on October 8, 2017 by Rune K. Svendsen
To solve Bitcoin’s scalability challenge, many so-called layer 2 protocols have been proposed. All of these protocols operate on the same, relatively simple, principle:
    User deposits bitcoins (via the Bitcoin blockchain) into the layer 2 system
    Stuff happens within the layer 2 system – without touching the Bitcoin blockchain – which assigns arbitrarily small parts of the deposited bitcoins to other users (recipients) in the system
    Recipients withdraw received bitcoins (into the Bitcoin blockchain)
This increases the scalability of transferring bitcoins from user to user, since at Step 2 nothing touches the blockchain. In fact, since nothing touches the blockchain, the transaction speed (as measured in transactions per second) is theoretically unlimited, and in practice only limited by latency and bandwidth between nodes.
The problem, however, is Step 1. When a user receives money – which humans usually receive monthly as wages/salaries – they need to deposit it into the layer 2 system, in order for it to be available within it. At the current block size limit of 1 MB, the maximum number of deposit transactions per month – assuming the simplest Bitcoin transaction (single-signature) with a size of 224 bytes is used – is 20 million1.
This is a maximum, since a single-signature Bitcoin transaction isn’t very interesting in the context of layer 2 protocols (it essentially constitutes sending your bitcoins to a trusted third party). Thus, with more complex (e.g. multi-signature) deposit transactions, the number of monthly users will be less than 20 million. Furthermore, this figure does not include the withdrawal transactions (where recipients withdraw funds from the layer 2 system to their private Bitcoin address), which will decrease the maximum number of supported users even further.
In conclusion, if Bitcoin is to scale to more than ~0.2% of the world’s population, layer 2 protocols – operating on the principle described above – will not be sufficient. The Bitcoin blockchain will need to increase its capacity in conjunction with layer 2 protocols, or it will not have sufficient capacity to support more than – at most – 20 million users per month.
      1 1,000,000 bytes per block/224 bytes per transactions = 4464 tx/block
         4464 tx/block*6 blocks per hour*24 hours per day = ~643000 tx/day
         643000 tx/day*30 days per month = ~20 million tx/month

It is pretty dangerous to try to remember a seed for a longer time than a few weeks. If you lose only one association you made, your money will be all gone.
There is a story from Ephraim Kishon in his book "Noah's Arc, tourist class" about this problem. In this story he was trying to remember a street called "Helsingfors Rd"
He couldn'T remember, so he started with associations, like Helsin is like the Finnish city Helsinki. Add a letter "g" and "fors" is just like the car "Ford".
He was able to remember the name that way until he arrived a few hours later and the Taxidriver wanted to know the name of the street. He was trying to remember "City in Skandinavia: Oslo!, add a letter "g" and what was the name of the car again. Was it american? Yeah, it was "Rolls Royce". So he told the Taxidriver to go to the Oslogrolls Rd....

"Bitcoin is a threat to the current system.  It is a threat just by its existence alone. "
" This is why Bitcoiners must be extra vigilant against any changes to the network that would sacrifice any iota of decentralization, which is what keeps Bitcoin free from censorship or government coercion."

100% proof would be, if Satoshi has signed a message with his PGP key, where he makes this statement. It was important enough to do it. The reason why the person didn't sign, could be, because he wasn't able, because he was not SN.
For example: Someone found out the real person behind SN and killed him, thinking he could steal his Bitcoins. Maybe he was able to get access to some of Satoshi's email adresses. After he realized, that he can't simply transfer SN's Bitcoins to his wallet, he tries to make it look, like Satoshi was still alive at a later date to cover his crime.
It might be fiction, but still possible. It would also explain some of the occurences, like "why SN didn't move his coins" or "why did SN suddenly leave Bitcoin developent?"

You didn't get the point of his problem. To send the Bitcoins with Bitcoin-QT, he needs to download the blockchain, which he wants to avoid.
Btw most of the commands, that can be used in Bitcoin-QT are made for the "users" and I, for beeing one, have used the dumpprivkey function a lot of times, without having problems.
Since I would call that wallet less secure after having its privkey in memory and/or a textfile, it is indeed better to send these Bitcoins to a new address after the dump. That's the part where I agree with luke-jr.

Please stop! The seed phrase is not the password to access the wallet.dat, but it is the Bitcoin PrivKey. So when somebody has found your seed phrase somewhere (for example in an unencrypted txt file on your phone) he will not even need your wallet.dat file to empty that address.
If you forgot to encrypt your wallet.dat with a password (Yeah. This is the password you were talking about) you can also just take that file and empty the wallet.
The seed phrase is something like a better - because usually more complex - brain wallet, where you convert this phrase into a Bitcoin private key and vice versa.
Seed phrase  = Bitcoin private key = wallet.dat

For that, all transaction/trades etc had to be repeated with =&gt; fees in times where you wouldn't know, which fork to follow and you can also expect a strong downswing in price, which will be a disaster when people have to pay higher Bitcoin amounts for products, they had already paid for, before the fork. Therefore the risk of chargebacks is also pretty high. What happens with the products, that have been paid before the fork and the seller has already sent it to the customer. Doublespends will probably be one of the standard issues.
