I think adding hardware wallet support to Core would be hassle-free *if there would be a standard*. Core is probably not willing to implement a proprietary protocol that works for just one or two of the major brands.
Is late but not to late to work out a standard. But standardizing things mostly require a certain amount of time.
@_date: 2016-08-17 13:23:54
Bip39 and Bip44 are only slightly indirect related to hardware wallet support.
Bip39 is controversial, AFAIK, one of the original author even distanced himself from the BIP. Also, the additional password protection with PBKDF with fixed iteration of 2048 seems to be something that only makes sense on MCUs.
Bip44 uses non hardened public key derivation. This is risky. Losing the xpub of the external chain together with a single standard key will reveal all your private keys. This can make sense if used together with hardware wallets (which brings us back to the topic of this thread).
But I agree, Core is not very fast on the "wallet side" due the lack of developers willing to work in this area.
@_date: 2016-08-23 08:38:16
I didn't said rejecting...
BIP39 can be useful. But IMO there are better proposals for mnemonics-like "export" of a hd seed. BIP39 problems: missing version, fixed 2048 KDF iterations, inefficient checksum.
Also, what I kinda don't like is, that user thinks, with mnemonics they can switch to a different wallet application. In practice, this is non-trivial and can lead to losing funds.
@_date: 2016-08-10 18:54:10
Sure. These types of PCs are not widely used today.
But what would you prefer? Telling people to use App Store software instead and fully trust the app store deployment process and all entities in the upload chain?
Assume Breadwallet has 100'000 users with funds of 100USD each (=10 mio USD).
**This "bounty" is extremely high.**
All it takes is hacking an App Store account either through security vulnerabilities or through social hacking by trying to get the app store password.
This risk is even worse then the Bitfinex setup.
I would say: "wake up and start building secure platforms where we can see a save Bitcoin mass adoption". The current App Stores and its poor security/trust model are centrally not something we should encourage users to use.
@_date: 2016-08-23 06:50:20
Bitcoin-Core has full BIP32 support (deterministic key generation). There is no support (and also no planned support) for BIP39 mnemonics ("24 words").
There is also no support for Bip44 because of a slightly weaker security model due to public child key derivation.
With 0.13, you can export your xpub over the RPC command ("dumpwallet").
Importing a seed is not possible right now.

So, you are trying to create high quality entropy, but then, use it over your browser on bitaddress.org? :-)
@_date: 2016-08-11 10:41:38
I agree that iOS (not sure about Android M) is one of the most secure platform **when it comes to malware protection**. But there are serval security layers. On iOS, you have a single entry point that's under total control through Apple. You have no possibility to verify if that single channel has been compromised. You cannot install firewall services that inform you, when and if applications are using the internet (and its URLs).
Also, Apples code signing is not really useful. Users can't verify the signature. Once a hacker could get your app-store password, he can just create new code signing certificates and a new provisioning files and upload an Breadwallet update under his name which still appears as Breadwallet did the signing and upload. He could probably remove all the emails in advance so that you and your employees are not getting informed anymore during the review steps.
Apple probably did this, because people thread code signing private keys like emails... they just lounge around somewhere on your system.
I agree on "most secure mass market computing platforms **in terms of malware protection**".
But I disagree that current iOS bitcoin wallets offer better security then desktop wallets. The missing verifiability as well as the missing hardware wallet support could even allow one to say that iOS bitcoin wallets offer a slightly weaker security model.
Look what apple just approved on the app store (referring to this threat).
All the review, code signing and is useless regarding the trust-/securiry-model Bitcoin users should build in their minds.
But don't get me wrong.
I'm also using Breadwallet (although I have installed it with my private ADP). But as long as there is no hardware wallet support or a way to verify if the app was built with a certain github commit, I would strongly advice to not store funds larger then 1000USD.
@_date: 2016-08-10 15:39:36
What cryptographical proves are possible to verify that the app is built with the Breadwallet source code and not tampered durin submission to the App Store?
IMO such setups should not protect funds higher then 1000usd.

The problem with BIP44 is, that most people are not aware, that public key derivation (which is proposed in BIP44) will slightly decrease the security model.
Losing the extended public key at the BIP44 level where its using public key derivation together with a single non-extended child private key result in revealing the whole HD chain.
Also, people have started "passing around xpubs" (example: copay). A leaked xpub will not result in possibilities to steal funds,... but it's a significant privacy issue.
This (and others) are the reasons why Bitcoin-Core does only support m/0'/0'/k' (only hardened private key derivation) at the moment.
Everything else would be a tiny security weakens over the non-HD mode of Core.
@_date: 2016-08-10 17:19:58
What you saying is, that Breadwallet offers no way to verify if the app was uploaded through you or someone from your company.
Your basically saying "users have to trust you and your company".
An attacker could hack your App Store password and upload a malicious app that sends out all private keys (just the seed would be enough).
Or it could even be an Apple inside job.
Look what happened to Bitfinex (in terms of evil forces).
I disagree with your perspective on desktop apps. There are very strong desktop computers like the orwl  which are much saver environment to run bitcoin wallets. There are USB connectors for hardware wallets, software-firewalls, tor connection layers, etc. (most stuff is not possible on iOS, maybe on Android).
Your disagreement with the 1000usd figure means that you are saying to the users "trust us with our key-management (apple account) and trust our employees".
**But it is technical trivial for Breadwallet to steal all private keys while nobody could really detect this before it's happening.**
I'm pretty sure such carelessness of the security model will end up in an another large scale disaster.
@_date: 2016-04-06 09:39:01
Right. The security sticker was kinda wrong.
DigitalBitbox will now look for alternatives (probably three sticker per package).
@_date: 2016-04-06 11:37:04
Right. The DigitalBitbox approach is the following:
-&gt; Only signed firmware can be installed (only DigitalBitbox has the keys)
-&gt; User can download the MCU code sources, review it, re-build it deterministic (documentation available) and get the signatures from the official build (only matches for the identical build) and upgrade the firmware.
After this process you can (almost) be sure that the DigitalBitbox is running the software you have checked-out/reviewed.
Attackers cannot create malicious firmwares because it would require multiple signatures to pass the bootloader or a drilling into the epoxy and connecting pins on the MCU.

Use bitcoincore 0.12 and set `-maxuploadtarget=1`

The Digitalbitbox uses Copays backend (Bitpay Wallet Service). It's open source and you can setup the backend also on a private server (if you don't want to use your own backend) together with Bitcoin Core.
With that setup, it's trivial to find out the unspent outputs (because you can retrieve data from a fullnode).
However, we are working on a SPV implementation to use the DigitalBitbox with just the p2p network (more bandwidth but no dependency on a client/server backend), though, we certainly keep the Multisig feature where you can participate in a shared Copay wallet.
@_date: 2016-03-25 16:26:22
Yes. You do want to move a backup away from the device (in case you loose it). And a backup should not pass your computer (could be compromised). SDCard is a perfect medium. Most SDCards have a 20year lifetime guarantee. Also they are extremely cheep. If you want a paper backup, use a printer with SDCard support.
Writing down bip39 mnemonics sucks and reduces the security.

I haven't done the calculation properly. But you can calc the consumption by taking the current hashrate, assume everyone is using a Antminer S7 (or similar) and calculate the cost per block (~6 blocks per h). Then assume a transaction size, calculate how many tx can ~fit in a 1MB block. Divide cost per block with amount of tx per block.

@_date: 2016-01-29 08:04:33
Agree. Extending the block size will reduce kWh per block/tx. But hash-rate will increase, electrical consumption also. IMO, with current mining centralization (~15 main miners), I don't see electricity costs coming down.
IMO, long term with current PoW, only fees can calibrate this "issue".

This defeats the purpose of the hardware wallet. Why not using your old laptop with no internet connection as hardware wallet?


I'm not saying BIP39 is insecure. We just preferred using AES-256-CBC with a proper KDF to encrypt the bip32 base58c encoded master private key.
Also writing down a secret has serval "side channel attacks" when not using an additional passphrase. The underground below your paper, the printer could be compromised, somebody could take a picture (yes, this is paranoia-level now :-) ).
We just think SDCards are a very good medium for backups.

You can still communicate to nodes not supporting bip151 (unencrypted traffic). But, you can now communicate encrypted with other nodes. At the moment, your ISP/WIFI could censor some transaction so that they can't leave your node or won't arrive on your node.
@_date: 2016-06-09 13:58:04
Your right. But you can't solve everything in one BIP. Check the "Risks" section: 
I'm working on the Auth BIP (which eliminates the MITM attack vector).
The Auth BIP probably needs to be deployed along with Bip151.
@_date: 2016-06-15 13:44:21
bip44 was considered. But one baby-step after another. Bip44 would reduce security slightly (by using public key derivation).
I'm working on a pull request to at least allow to use Bip44.
@_date: 2016-06-09 18:58:33
It's a nodes local policy to decide to only connect to "encrypted" nodes. It not something the BIP defines. But I guess after a transition time, more nodes will set the requirement to only connect to nodes supporting encryption after BIP151.
@_date: 2016-06-09 20:09:04
What if you only want to talk to a specific node (encrypted)?
@_date: 2016-06-09 07:12:23
There are already many option to encrypt the traffic: VPN, curveCP, stunnel, etc.
But sadly nobody really use this. What we need is a simple, built in, dependency-free encryption that will be enabled automatically when you run bitcoind or any wallet that uses the p2p protocol.
@_date: 2016-06-16 07:15:30
BIP44 compatibility is something we work towards. A first switch from traditional key generation to HD should not reduce security.
With BIP44, there is a risk of revealing all your private keys when someone can access your extended public key at internal/external chain depth together with a single private child key (which slightly reduces the security model).
Right now I'm working on a PR to make the keypath (BIP44, etc.) flexible/configurable.
@_date: 2017-01-07 08:54:44
I think it will take a couple of month until this is stable enough to get shipped. Maybe 0.15. Depends how much of you are willing to test and report... :-)
@_date: 2016-11-14 12:39:00
Most stuff is already possible with Core. No need to a fork that needs endless rebasing.
Bitcoin Core can already create `OP_RETURN` (you call it null data) transactions. Check `createrawtransaction`.
In conjunction with `fundrawtransaction`, that totally sufficient to create OP_RETURN transactions.
To get OP_RETURN transactions out of a block, you could simple write a tiny shell/bitcoin script that parses out those.
(script could call `getblock`, maybe pipe it to a json parser [or directly in your script]).
@_date: 2016-11-30 19:15:31
Right now there is no internal way how to restore from an xprv. However there are two change requests that would allow a such operation: 
Also, I expect some third party tools (maybe a python script) that could take care of importing/creating a wallet with an existing xpriv.
@_date: 2016-11-09 17:08:36
Right. You can already use a VPN or similar. I guess BIP151/150 can make it possible for a normal enduser to run a thin-client against a trusted-node.
Electrum is a bad alternative if you just want to drive one or a handful of wallets.
Electrum servers indexes the whole blockchain resulting in tons of MB of data which will never be used by your thin-clients.
@_date: 2016-11-14 22:04:17
No worries. Your PR looks good and I think your C++ is better then you think.
I just recommend you to do it outside of Core or try to get PRs into master.
Otherwise you will need to rebase the PR every here and there (it's already out-of-date because of some RPC server changes).
If you attach to the REST interface, you script/app will "last" much longer.
@_date: 2016-11-10 07:26:41
If someone wants to block bitcoin traffic, there is probably nothing you can do.
Even if you run fully encrypted traffic on a different non standard port (lets say 443), one can analyze the traffic, burst rate, package size, etc. and find out, that this is very likely bitcoin traffic.
I think the only effective way would be a constant stream of data containing junk during the time when no actual data gets passed. But I don't need to state the efficiency of that. :)
I guess such traffic analyzing is also possible when using tor/i2p.
@_date: 2016-11-14 14:51:08
If you need performance, use the REST (since Core 0.12) interface and get raw serialized blocks (non JSON).
You could do that with a C++ program that uses libevent2 as http client. This would be almost as fast as it would be compiled internally.

The idea behind the new Icons is that they are look more professional, streamlined and clean, and – not to forget – that they support HiDPI (retina os OX).

Bitcoin-Core is open source, if you think a option to allow themes would make sense, try to implement it or find someone who can. But i think there are much more interesting things to do before thematizing bitcoin-qt.
The new icons are certainly a matter of taste... i have to admit i really like them.

Disabling firmware updates can make sense for a &lt;100USD device if it increases security. Given that you might store funds larger then you daily-spends of you physical wallet it can be worth reducing a risk by disabling update-feature.

I also had the chance to inspect the bitbox hardware wallet at the last bitcoin meetup in zurich. It is amazing!
The API is well designed (i like the very raw non-DER signing!) and there is no reason to use the internal chip based PRNG if you don't like.
Use multisig (maybe 2of2), create a master seed somewhere you think the entropy is save and allow your bitbox hardware wallet to sign/complete your multisig tx.
Maybe a even more reduced bitbox wallet could make sense. No PRNG, no backup, no SDCard. Just a HID which signs transaction with a given key at keypath. Of course you once need to set your masterkeys seed over USB.

Currently we see users shutting down nodes because they generate to much traffic. In my opinion a node that verifies and relays the last couple of blocks and all recent transaction - but - can't be used to bootstrap (IBD) new nodes and therefore saves up roughly 80% of the traffic is something that can keep the network healthy. If you have enough traffic to share, fine, then you should not use -maxuploadtarget.

We have decided last Thursday (IRC meeting) to very likely include  into 0.13 which allows to include the XPRIV into the walletdump.
There is no reason to dump the XPUB right now (because we only use hardened private key derivation).
Once we allow a flexible keypath, we certainly need a way to dump the xpub.
You need to see that the current BIP32 implementation is minimal (and came relatively shortly before the 0.13 release). I have written two other Bip32 patches before the one that actually made it into master (much more feature rich). The one that is included now in master is extremely minimal which allows to keep the risks at a minimum.
More flexibility with HD will be in 0.14.

Auditing/Watchonly wallet require public key derivation which is currently not supported in Core 0.13 (public key derivation includes some security risks).
Once we allow public key derivation along with something like bip44, we would also need a way to export the xpub (will very likely be in 0.14).
But right now with the xpub in 0.13 you could not derive child keys.
