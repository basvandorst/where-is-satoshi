Nice, good luck! Let me know if you find anything confusing in my guide.
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:39:09
Can you use "bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo"?
If yes, Eclair should be able to connect to the Bitcoin RPC with 
    eclair.bitcoind.rpcuser="raspibolt"
    eclair.bitcoind.rpcpassword="PASSWORD_[E]"
Can you check if the username and password match in bitcoin.conf and eclair.conf? Maybe try a simple password for starters, like "ABCD".
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:44:02
Glad to hear you like it! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:37:41
Not sure I get your question. The Pi runs completely headless, no screen attached ever. Are you referring to the image out there, where a Pi Bitcoin node has a quite matrix TFT text display? Me likes and thinking about it... ;-) 
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:19:26
PSA: I just updated the "Beginner’s Guide to ️⚡Lightning️⚡ on a Raspberry Pi" to today's new Alpha9 release of Eclair and added some information on how to kickstart the node (connect &amp; open channels).
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:58:55
See here, I opened an issue on github regarding this topic:
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:36:56
Sorry, my bad, yes you need the file "...../testnet3/debug.log". Maybe the last 100 lines are helping:
     tail -n 100 /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log
Can you copy paste them? The bitcoin.conf file looks fine.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:52:16
Thanks for the suggestion, will have a look at it. Disabling SSH seems not possible, how would you interact with the Pi? Would you say adding fail2ban is essential, even when one would use SSH keys?
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:42:03
Did you unlock your bitcoin wallet? I found that the error "incufficent funds" can also relate to a locked wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:21:48
Not really my area of expertise...
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:57:04
Nice! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:01:11
Thanks for all the love, guys &amp; gals! I will keep on refining the guide until we are live on mainnet. :-)
Keep the suggestions coming, please. I am not a sysadmin and am learning a lot myself. I will try to balance security with accessability, which is not that easy.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:10:41
The usernames &amp; passwords **must** match:
    bitcoin.conf: rpcuser --&gt; eclair.conf: eclair.bitcoind.rpcuser
    bitcoin.conf: rpcpassword --&gt; eclair.conf: eclair.bitcoind.rpcpassword
If you change just the eclair.conf file, the eclair service needs to be restarted. As user "pi" enter:
    pi $ sudo systemctl stop eclair.service
    pi $ sudo systemctl start eclair.service
    pi $ tail -f /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log
If you also changed the bitcoin.conf file, it's easiest to just restart the Pi. 
    pi $ sudo shutdown -r now
After that log in again and check the eclair log file. It's possible that eclair fails a few time, as it can only start after bitcoind loaded the blockchain index. Give it a few minutes.
    
Keep me posted of the results.
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:56:28
Good points, thanks for your thoughtful answer. Do the channels expire at a certain point in time? If so, and if there is no malicious counterparty, the funds would just be frozen until then, right? 
On the other hand, the Lightning node could be set up on a new device with the underlying Bitcoin seed (SPV or Full Node) and the next time the channel is - honestly - used by the other party, I would have a new transaction representing the channel state. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:39:43
I overhauled the Bitcoin Core verification section to get the key from MIT and use the sha256sum check mode. Would like to get your feedback!
@_date: 2018-01-27 09:37:44
Added an external article on how to set up ssh keys for the moment. Rethinking the structure once we hit mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:32:53
Dependencies errors with this official package seems strange to me. It's nothing special. What does it say? 
If you can download the driver, I'd use NTFS and maybe reformat the drive with "mkntfs". This way, you can still attach it to a windows computer.
If you can't install the NTFS driver, you can always format the disk as ext3 or ext4. Haven't tried it with these filesystems yet, though.
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:35:39
Did you check the logfile /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log? For testing purposes, you can always start "bitcoind" directly from command line. Any reason given in the log?
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:39:25
With this guide you are running a Bitcoin full node on TESTNET, and the Lightning node on top automatically also runs on testnet. The Bitcoin mainnet is actually blocked by the firewall settings, just to be sure.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:43:49
Addition: you MUST set the option `txindex=1` in the bitcoin.conf file, otherwise you have to reindex the blockchain on the Pi again.
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:54:04
Added fail2ban to the guide. Would you mind checking it?
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:06:06
If you did not configure your windows node to run with *txindex=1* then the blockchain needs to be reindexed by the Pi. Two options:
1) Reindex on the Pi, will take a few hours.
    bitcoind -reindex
2) configure your windows Bitcoin Core to create the txindex by setting it in the *bitcoin.conf* file (like on the Pi) and moving the files again. Should be faster, but more steps necessary.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:00:13
Is it possible to replicate my channel states in real time into IPFS, preferrably encripted using the underlying BIP39 seed? Do you have any specifics?
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:49:20
Ok, thanks for the nudge regarding SSH keys. And yes, obviously, physical access solves the backup login, didn't think about that... :-) Any suggestions regarding the save entry of the wallet encryption password, are there best practices?
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:00:43
Seems the Eclair service starts but fails. Can you check the logfile /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log? Will be back after dinner... ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:16:01
No worries. Check out their official readme first.
And maybe just restart the Pi (with user "pi"), if you haven't done so yet.
    sudo shutdown -r now
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:51:34
Thanks, already fixed points 2 &amp; 3. Will think about 1 and 3 when things slow down a bit... ;-)
So, everything is working fine?
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:13:41


Thanks, fixed the typo. :-)
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:39:59
It should be possible, but it can take ages (weeks). I would recommend syncing on your regular desktop / laptop. Just install Bitcoin Core, start it up and then it asks for the working directory. Point it to the external hdd (directory /bitcoin/) and let it sync. After that, attach the hdd to the Pi and mount it. The Pi should be up-to-date immediately.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:44:32
Addition: you MUST set the option txindex=1 in the bitcoin.conf file, otherwise you have to reindex the blockchain on the Pi again.
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:11:41
Ok, sounds reasonable. Will work on a guide to preload the blockchain to the hdd remotely, as this will definitely be necessary for the mainnet. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:36:30
That's normal, the option -f lets you stream new lines constantly. Best run in a separate session to monitor the log while you enter commands in another ssh session. 
In putty I close it with ctrl-c.
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:36:28
I updated the guide to install a different NTFS driver. Try this:
    $ sudo umount /mnt/hdd
    $ sudo apt-get install ntfs-3g
    $ sudo mount -a
Let me know if that helps.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:59:00
What result do you get with "bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo", is it still syncing? Eclair can only run if the blockchain is ready
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:02:46
I usually open two PuTTY sessions:
1. to enter commands
2. with the `tail -f /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log` scrolling away.
You then can see what happens in the log file when you enter a command.
See my two issues on Github:
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:21:55
Maybe try to get some funds to a new WITNESSADDR[C] directly from the Bitcoin Test Faucet?
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:52:20
The following should work:
    eclair.server.public-ips=["1.2.3.4"]
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:40:28
07:38:55 up 1 day,  7:57,  1 user,  load average: 0.08, 0.02, 0.01
with three lightning channels open and the bitcoind up-to-date. However, this is testnet... will be interesting on mainnet.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:17:48
Should just be a question of time until you see the "unconfirmed_balance" if you were able to send the tx and the blockchain explorers shows it. As long as you sent it to yourself... :-)
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:57:07
I think Eclair uses a queue that takes new commands. Somehow, this queue can be very full (in my case rechecking all 2000+ nodes) and new requests have to wait in line...
Nothing we can do at the moment, they are working on it.
No idea about mainnet. I support the idea to only deploy production quality... :-)

@_date: 2018-01-27 09:36:22
Hi Luccio, not sure what these error messages mean... But good to hear that you could solve the issue with going for ext4. Was the original file system NTFS? Keep me posted! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:42:25
Note quite. Install Bitcoin Core on your regular computer like any other program. But when you first start it, it asks for the working directory. Now you point to your external hdd (directory "/bitcoin/"), so all blockchain-related data is stored there. Let it sync and once it's finished, attach the hdd to the Pi and mount it. The Pi should be up-to-date immediately.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:20:45
Do you have access to the external hdd at all? Can you copy a testfile ? Someone else also had issues with a read-only external hdd.
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:46:11






It seems like your original copy of the Bitcoin blockchain was built without the option *txindex=1*, can you verify that?
Also, would you mind moving the logfile dumps to a [Gist]( or [Pastebin]( 
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:12:52
The first errors are to be expected, as the user "pi" does not know the RPC user &amp; password.
The user "bitcoin", however, should definitely have access. 
1) Restart the Pi, so that all services are restarted and the current configuration is used.
    pi $ sudo shutdown -r now
2) Please provide the following files, eg. using [Pastebin]( (make sure to remove your password):
    /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/debug.log
    /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
I'm sure we'll figure it out. ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:41:08
The 24 word seed is probably for the underlying Bitcoin funds, as the eclair Android wallet is also able to handle these. It just allows to derive the root key and all associated HD keys, but not the channel states.
I just set up a Bitcoin Core full node on Ubuntu with the Eclair lightning node on top. The Eclair node does not need any external private keys (and does not show any seed) as it communicates with the Bitcoin Core node directly via RPC. 
There is a eclair.sqlite file that probably stores all the channel states. This would need to be backed up / replicated in near-realtime, I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-24 12:50:56
Probably too many manual steps, would be outdated and not updateable in a week. I'll finish this project until it's production ready, maybe someone will dockerize it? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:39:47
Updated the guide. Passwords are now enclosed by quotes and should not contain quotes or spaces, just to be sure. I'll leave the oracle-java8-jdk for the time being, as it should always be available for the Raspian distribution and I have not checked with openjdk-8-jre. Are you running it this way? Would it be worth it to change?
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:23:50
Thanks for your "noob" feedback! :-) Please keep me in the loop how it's going and where you're stuck, so I can further polish the guide. Good luck!
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:45:26
Just for your information, I am checking the setup also with @_date: 2018-01-27 18:26:36
Whoohoo! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:36:59
I updated the guide yesterday to also change the root password. Will that solve this issue in your opinion?
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:53:37
Updated with video Blockaccino purchase using my RaspiBolt!
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:20:15
Yes, it's absolutely necessary. It's just a reindex, all downloaded blocks don't need to be downloaded again. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:54:42
Definitely, yes. Just download Bitcoin Core for your laptop and start syncing the mainnet. This will create a working folder with the exact same structure as the /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/ folder.
When you start the wallet for the first time, it asks for a working directory. If you don't have enough space on your laptop, you can point it to an external drive directly.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:50:24
You get this error when using `bitcoin-cli`or `eclair-cli`?
Did you replace the `PASSWORD_[E]`with your personal password? I would recommend something simple for testing first.
@_date: 2018-01-25 07:21:22


To run Bitcoin Core, only this command is needed. You do not need to manually copy additional files. But learning getting around Linux is time well spent. :-)


You create the bitcoin.conf file with the Nano text editor. It does not exist, so it's created. Is the following command too ambiguous?
    $ nano /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
And you are right. As the /home/user/.bitcoin/ directory is a pointer to /mnt/hdd/bitcoin/ on the external hdd, it is actually created on the hard disk. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:29:00
Yes, that does not reveal much... Let's go deeper. Login as user "pi"
    pi $ sudo systemctl stop bitcoind.service
    pi $ sudo nano /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf
Set you rpcpassword to something simple, like *rpcpassword=ABCD*. Save and exit.
    pi $ sudo systemctl start bitcoind.service
    pi $ tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log
Check if you find any error messages. If not and the node begins syncing with the network, exit with Ctrl-X
    pi $ sudo su bitcoin
    bitcoin $ bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo
Any luck?
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:03:06
I guess I would disable the SSH login by password completely using "PasswordAuthentication no", otherwise there's no point in adding SSH keys for enhanced security reasons.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:32:27
Anything telling in the debug.log?
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:16:19
Nice to hear! I think on testnet it's not worth the hassle to preload the blockchain. It usually syncs in 10 hours for me from scratch, including all indexing.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:58:44
My "Beginner’s Guide to Lightning on a Raspberry Pi" is based on alpha8, but I'll update it to alpha9 asap.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:10:40
Thanks for the further detail. For me it's important to run a full node, and if you do this, you cannot prune it. See 
 (the argument --txindex does not work with a pruned node).
The possibility to run LND with a Bitcoin light client (Neutrino) was new to me. Interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:09:32
Strange. If "bitcoin-cli" is working (like "bitcoin-cli getbalance"), the RPC interface is running. And Eclair just uses these two attributes to connect to the bitcoind.
Do you have the following lines in the bitcoin.conf file?
    zmqpubrawblock=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
    zmqpubrawtx=tcp://127.0.0.1:29000
Just to be sure: are you on Bitcoin testnet? Please check with `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo`, where it should say
    "chain": "test"
Not sure how to help here. Maybe you ask directly in the Eclair support forum? They are very supportive.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:18:28
At the moment, it's mainly a great way to learn about Bitcoin and Lightning. Later on mainnet, you can help keep the network decentralized, minimize the trust you need to put in 3rd parties (like exchanges or SPV wallets) and mybe even get some $$ for routing payments (more likely pocket change, but nice nonetheless).
This are my five satoshis, anyway. Not a real expert here, just someone who dropped down the rabbit hole... ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:56:34
Thanks for your feedback! Looking to add ssh keys, would make it quite more complex for beginners, though. And how would you handle a lost key? Are there best practices for a fallback login?
By the password, you are referring to the rpcpassword? It's easiest to enter it directly in Nano, both in bitcoin.conf and eclair.conf. Do you see more secure but still accessible ways?
@_date: 2018-01-27 14:02:40
No problem, this guide has almost become a mission... ��
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:47:30
The first issue might be due to a read-only hdd. I added the installation of an additional NTFS driver to the guide, in case your hdd is NTFS formatted. Otherwise you might just want to format it (eg. using "mkntfs", then you can still attach the drive to a windows computer).
I'd solve that problem before proceeding.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:16:09
That's normal behaviour. When starting, the bitcoin daemon loads all indexes and is rewinding some blocks. Should not take more than a minute. During this time, you'll get this error code -28
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:53:31
Not sure about any limits. I myself use 30 characters, with ! and - in it. Did you use any other special characters? Would be helpful for others to know, if some are causing problems...
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:58:39
I was also surprised that modern drives with a dedicated power supply are more expensive than the small portable ones. This is one of the reasons I opted for a HDD enclosure + an old hard disk.
You can always run a modern USB-only drive with a powered USB hub, though. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:54:27
Hi Elavid, thanks for your valued feedback! Unfortunately gpg2 is not installed on the Pi by default. This is why I opted to the curl command. Would it be worth the extra step to install gpg2 in your opinion?
Why would my article be a trusted place at all? I linked to the search functionality of the MIT pgp server to look up the Key ID  especially for this reason.
@_date: 2018-01-28 09:01:47
Thanks a lot for all this great input. This is exactly what makes providing this guide and refining it with the community such a great learning opportunity for everyone, me included! :-)
I will go through all your provided inputs and update my guide acoordingly.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:13:55
There is always a `bitcoin.conf`file, even under Windows. There, you need to include `txindex=1` like on the Pi, otherwise the blockchain will not be indexed and the Pi has to do all indexing again.
The download is not even what's taking so long, it's the validation and indexing. Thus, I would also increase the dbcache
Check out the bitcoin.conf generator by Jameson Lopp:
    # Set database cache size in megabytes; machines sync faster with a larger cache. 
    # Recommend setting as high as possible based upon machine's available RAM.
    dbcache=4000
    # Maintain a full transaction index, used by the getrawtransaction rpc call.
    txindex=1
@_date: 2018-01-26 19:54:29
Thanks for the suggestions, will update the guide. ��‍����
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:59:08
Yeah, this command also uses a channel to get all known nodes of the network. What does your eclair.log say?
The script "eclair-cli" does not parse the API answer correctly. I think the "return key" (CR/LF) at the end of the response is missing... Another issue for the github repository.
Logging out for the night. Will be skiing tomorrow. Have fun tinkering, I'll be back. Welcome to the early adopters! :-)
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:59:57
Yes. Maybe make two directories on the hdd (bitcoin-test &amp; bitcoin-main), then you just need to point the symbolic link (/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin) to the other directory. And open port 8333 in the Firewall.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:35:08
Definitely! The switch will hopefully be quite simple, mainly some more performance tweaking necessary due to heavier data lifting and additional security measures. 
However, I will not jump the gun before there are "official" releases for mainnet available.  is nice, but not for a beginner's guide. So I'm not sure when this actually will be the case.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:27:41
Thanks for the feedback. With Eclair you definitely need a non-prunding Bitcoin full node running. There may be other options, to my knowledge other clients need this as well. 
I never tried to run a Node purely on SD card, but constant IO (eg. with a swap file) is definitely degrading the card. Indexing transactions may cause be similar. See  
On the testnet, catching up with the blockchain is pretty fast, as there are many empty blocks. But on mainnet, it will definitely be an option to install Bitcoin Core on your desktop computer, point its data directory to the external HDD and let it sync with more CPU/RAM. After that, you can simply connect it to the Pi as long the directory symbolic link (.bitcoin) points to the right directory. 
Will add this point to the todo list for the part when we go to mainnet. ;-)  
@_date: 2018-01-28 08:57:43
Nice, congrats! Feel free to send me a test-tip! ;-)
@_date: 2018-01-27 19:38:50
Well, at the moment I get the same response. Not sure why, as I have four channels open and in state "NORMAL".
The strange error message is the alpha software speaking. You can do the same without "eclair-cli" and get the answer of the API directly:
    $ curl --user eclair-cli:PASSWORD_[F] --silent --show-error -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "method": "send", "params" : ["lntb1u..............qhs7nzp"] }' 
    The server was not able to produce a timely response to your request. Please try again in a short while!
That's alpha software for you. I am documenting at the moment to open an Issue on the Acinq Github. If you enter the "send" command, you can check in the logfile which channel is used and it fails. At my end, Eclair always chooses a channels with status "OFFLINE"...
Not sure how it's looking at your side. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:55:48
This is a very valid point, thanks for pointing it out. I will update the guide to avoid this single point of trust.
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:57:57
Also: make sure to dowload the mainnet blockchain with `txindex=1`, otherwise you have to reindex it again...
@_date: 2018-01-23 07:20:22
As I want the Pi to run headless somewhere in a corner, I guess I'm stuck with SSH. Will look to use ssh keys for login though.
Will try to incorporate Fail2ban and post a draft here. Would be great if you could have a look at it then. 
@_date: 2019-11-17 15:42:28
What products did you sell? Did you also buy them in the darknet, or from real life sources?

It is no longer maintained, as it's simply too much work to keep both Raspberry Pi and Odroid up to date. The RaspiBolt guide is applicable almost 1:1 to other ARM platforms like Odroid or Pine64, however.
I tagged the deprecated guide as a GitHub release for future reference:
@_date: 2019-12-16 08:46:39
Thanks u/TheGreatMuffin, much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:20:53
Yes, it keeps about \~40 GB or additional indexes.
@_date: 2019-12-16 08:56:08
You could run a pruned node, without the Electrs server.
I would not recommend it, however, as SD cards and USB flashdrives are not meant for constant writing operations and wear out very quickly. I guess your drive would die within a year. You should use a hard disk or SSD for something like that.
@_date: 2019-12-16 08:48:32
In my opinion, profitable Lightning routing will become a specialized area, with data scientists developing better and better channel management algorithms. This setup is not meant for professional routing, but as your own sovereign Bitcoin and Lightning node, giving you privacy and verifiability.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:53:40
Yes, just not as nice... �� It's tagged as release 1.0 on Github 
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:13:06
Electrs has a full index of every transaction and does not need to know what addresses to monitor in advance. So you can just ask it for balances and transaction history for any wallet, no biggie.
Electrum Personal Server relies on watch-only addresses in Bitcoin Core and does not have additional indexes. So you need to add your xPub to the configuration and then let Bitcoin Core rescan the blockchain. After that you're good, but you need to do that for every additional/new wallet you create.
@_date: 2019-12-16 20:57:59
Indexing is very heavy load, ~6h at 100%. But lnd and bitcoind can still run and are usable, just a bit slower than usual. Or just let it run overnight.
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:34:26

Best shilling ever! :-D
Yes, Lightning is fantastic. Yes, it will revolutionize payments. But it's only as strong as its base layer, and Bitcoin is the strongest one there is. 
Regarding $$$: I wouldn't run it for profit, definitely not on testnet ;), but also on mainnet the fees are expected to be very low (which is a good thing!). Barriers to entry for other participants are almost zero, so the fee market will tend to the bottom.
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:53:12
I completely agree. The main bottleneck is the necessity to have a full bitcoin node running, but that will change once Neutrino SPV mode is available on mainnet.
It's no problem to run your LND node on a RPi Zero in that mode. Check my  project for some pointers:
@_date: 2018-03-18 13:55:53
As you can see in the `lnd.conf`, the autopilot is active and will use 60% of committed funds to open a max of 5 channels.
I committed 0.01 BTC and it opened 2 channels with a total of 0.006 BTC automatically, including funding transactions. Not sure how fast this happens, though, as LND first needs to "understand" the network graph.
You can always open a manual channel additionally.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:00:36
Probably not possible at all, you need a different linux image to start with. But the setup process is mostly identical and if you use an external hdd on the Pi, you can just mount it on a different device with all the data downloaded already.
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:56:26
Yes, I completely overhauled the guide a few weeks back with Bitcoin Core 0.17.0.1 and LND 0.5, building a new node from scratch. It's as much a reference for me as for everybody else... :-)
BTW: I got rid of the nasty "getpublicip" script in that process, the setup now uses the LND UPnP-feature to get your public ip address and announce it to other Lightning nodes.
@_date: 2018-11-26 06:51:27
The wallet / seed only secures your on-chain balance. It is not possible to backup the channel state at the moment, so even if you could restore an old channel state, if its outdated your peer would think that you're cheating, with you losing all the channel balance.
Without the channel.db it's not possible to restore your end of the channels. However, your peers will probably close the inactive channels after some time and then the funds will return to your on-chain wallet automatically. So I'd keep the bitcoin / lnd node running from time to time over the next few months, chances are that your funds will be back.

@_date: 2018-11-23 16:47:42
The Pi is can handle this setup well, but there are some peaks in memory usage. This is why a swapfile is required. Not sure how much memory PiHole uses. If the Pi starts swapping constantly that could bring the whole thing down, but if it's pretty lightweight it could work. 
On the other hand, a Pi is the perfect tool to have usecase-specific devices. I'd never expose my Bitcoin node with more ports to the public internet than absolutely necessary.

As long as it runs a modern linux distribution (I recommend Ubuntu 16.04 LTS), there should be no issues. You just need to get the correct binaries (not ARM) for bitcoind and lnd.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:26:51
It's not really necessary for yourself, as bitcoind can still connect to other nodes. Other nodes cannot connect to you, however, eg. to download blocks and relay transactions. No big deal, it usually connects to only 8 peers anyway.
The same goes for LND, you can open channels and keep them alive, but others cannot find you and open channels with you. Here it has some consequences, as it's harder to have incoming liquidity (all funds are on your own side if you open all your channels yourself) and you cannot route transactions for other peers. It still works great for your own use, though.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:53:33
Minimum version of Go has been raised to go1.10 for building LND, please check the updated guide for details.

I know, this guide is a bit short on the basic stuff. Check out the referenced [Raspberry Pi guide]( it explains everything in more detail (including screen capture video).
Basically, you access it using Secure Shell (remote command line). The goal is to have a desktop wallet or mobile app connect directly to you own server, but I'm not sure if that's possible yet.

Make sure to include the argument `deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress` in your bitcoin.conf, otherwise Eclair won't be able to open channels due to the now native Segwit support of Bitcoin Core. See updated guide for reference.
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:52:13
Regarding your fixed IP: inside your home network, the Pi needs a fixed ip address. This can be configured in the router with DHCP, or you could tell your Pi to just use a certain ip (but then there could be conflicts with other devices).
Regarding the public ip address of your router to the internet: this is indeed an issue. On my "Thundroid" guide I have a script that detects this ip and hands it over to the Lightning client. I will also update the RaspiBolt guide in that regard.
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:51:29
Never measured it, but as it's capable of running with a 2A/5V mobile phone charger I'd say the node's energy consumption should not be a big deal.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:24:15
Nobody knows yet. There will be (minimal) fees for routing payments, but this is not why I'm running my own node. If it pays some pocket change in the end, that's great, but don't expect to get rich.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:32:00
If you're open for other SBC, everything with an embedded eMMC (eg. the Hardkernel Odroid series) can run without an sdcard and this memory type is much more resilient.

Shouldn't be a problem in regards to resources. I had several Pi running during that period, without issues.

Yes, it's possible to run your pruned node directly from the SD card. I would advise against it, however: sd card degrade very rapidly (life expectancy &lt; 1 year under constant usage) and you cannot really backup your Lightning funds at the moment. In the guide, only the operating system runs on the sd card, so it should last much longer. And everything valuable is on the hard disk.
Regarding mining I never delved into it, as it's completely pointless on a RPi (except for educational purposes, as you mentioned).
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:18:41
You could do remote desktop (VNC, XRDP...), would probably be more flexible. Keep us posted! ��
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:24:01
It includes a script that gets your public (dynamic) ip address every 10 minutes. This ip address is passed to the Lighting node on startup, but it is mostly used to announce your node to other (unknown) peers, or the Lightning explorer (I think). 
The Lightning node handles ip changes internally and connected nodes and channels stay connected anyway, even without announcing your IP address at all. 
So I'd say yes, it works. Maybe a Lightning service restart is needed from time to time so that the publicly announced ip address is updated.
Would be good to try, keep us posted! :)
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:36:58
I think the guides have different goals. Mine is more about learning and being the proud owner of a node you completely set up yourself. While the docker guide is certainly more efficient in just spinning up a node.  :-)

Thanks for the encouraging feedback, much appreciated!  
You are touching on a multitude of topics: basic Linux, program-specific configuration, Lightning internals, etc. I don't think an easy, comprehensive "book" exitst for that, rather many API documenations and the source-code itself.
For Linux, I can recommend the O'Reilly book "Ten Steps to Linux Survival" (also available as free PDF):  
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:17:09
Nobody knows for sure yet, heavily depending on your hardware and connectivity. But it's not really important, as payments are routed around bottlenecks, so the network as a whole should be millions of transactions / second

On the Raspberry Pi there's not enough resources to run a desktop as well, but I think with the Odroid there might be. Will look into it as well.
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:16:01
That's what I know:
    bitcoin $ lncli closechannel
    NAME:
       lncli closechannel - Close an existing channel.
    USAGE:
       lncli closechannel [command options] funding_txid [output_index [time_limit]]
    DESCRIPTION:
      Close an existing channel. The channel can be closed either cooperatively,
      or unilaterally (--force).
      A unilateral channel closure means that the latest commitment
      transaction will be broadcast to the network. As a result, any settled
      funds will be time locked for a few blocks before they can be spent.
      In the case of a cooperative closure, One can manually set the fee to
      be used for the closing transaction via either the --conf_target or
      --sat_per_byte arguments. This will be the starting value used during
      fee negotiation. This is optional.
    OPTIONS:
       --funding_txid value  the txid of the channel's funding transaction
       --output_index value  the output index for the funding output of the funding transaction (default: 0)
       --time_limit value    a relative deadline afterwhich the attempt should be abandoned
       --force               after the time limit has passed, attempt an uncooperative closure
       --block               block until the channel is closed
       --conf_target value   (optional) the number of blocks that the transaction *should* confirm in, will be used for fee estimation (default: 0)
       --sat_per_byte value  (optional) a manual fee expressed in sat/byte that should be used when crafting the transaction (default: 0)
Not much to go wrong, at least as long as tx fees are so incredibly low.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:09:30
You can run a Windows server, of course. But it needs way more resources and both Bitcoin Core and LND are not built to run as Windows services, but as applications. This is not optimal for 24/7 including monitoring etc. It works, but there's an incredible overhead.

Do you have a channel in state "NORMAL"? Or is it dropped / closed after a while? Check my discussion with UfoFood, maybe there is also an issue with "insufficient funds" (check the eclair.log)

Updating Bitcoin Core is straight-forward, see the FAQ section in the guide:
The upgrade to LND 0.5 is not as trivial, however, and there are some issues that can arise. I'd therefore recomment to close all channels before upgrading (again, described in the FAQ):
@_date: 2018-03-03 10:21:12
It's not per se the connection speed (you can use 100kb/s, no issue) but the overall bandwith. Without limits (which are possible), you can have 100+ GB up &amp; download per month. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:53:03
Yep, this exactly. If you just want to spin up a Lightning node, I'd go with some docker images (eg. from [SatoshiPortal]( or run [BTCPayServer]( on a cloud server.
&lt;shilling&gt; I don't think Lightning is stable enough to "just use it" without understanding the technical underlyings, so in my opinion it's worthwile to get your hands dirty and learn how to build the RaspiBolt yourself. &lt;/shilling&gt; :-)

1. I would copy everything, and replace the bitcoin.conf
2. Yes
3. Both work, as long as you are already in the directory "/home/bitcoin". In the guide I always use absolute paths to avoid mistakes, but you can also do `cd /home/bitcoin`, `rm .bitcoin`or you could also type `rm ~/.bitcoin`, as the `~`represents your home directory. 
4. Yes
5. See updated link. You might want to delete the old files in the download directory first.
No problem, it's kind of nice to help people out that are genuinely interested. ;-)

Wow, there really is something like a Garlicoin, lol
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:44:40
I can try. :-)
Starting with Bitcoin, it allows you to own digital value. You can send it directly to anyone in the world, without the need to trust someone and nobody can prevent you from doing so. For this, if you do not want to have a middleman, you need to run the Bitcoin software yourself (called a Full Node).
This value transfer is very strong, but a bit clunky, like moving gold. Everybody running Bitcoin worldwide will record your transaction. This is not very good for a huge amount of small transactions. Imaging everybody worldwide storing everybody elses email, that simply wouldn't work.
For this, the Lightning network could be a solution. You create real Bitcoin transactions, and exchange them with your counterpart, but do not send it to everyone just yet. But you could, anytime. You can exchange a lot of transactions, each replacing the last one. And you do not need to know your counterpart, as the network searches for a path with up to 20 hops. This scales to millions of transactions.
If you want to finalize your balance, or if someone wants to cheat, you can broadcast the latest transaction and the Bitcoin network settles the final balance. 
This guide tells you how to run a Bitcoin Full Node and a Lightning node that you can use to pay other people with Bitcoin (on the Bitcoin blockchain, or using the Lightning method).
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:42:00
I think you may have found an error in my guide... But don't fret, we'll get you through... ;-)

Your analogy is a bit flawed, as Usenet does not need consensus. It just is and nobody cares if you upload cat pictures that nobody wants to see. 
 
Bitcoin, however, reaches worldwide consensus of which bitcoin belong to which address every ten minutes.

As a believer in Bitcoin as a completely trustless system, however, I do not intend to delegate this to server farms that don't necessarily have my best interests in mind.

Yes, that would work perfectly well. Couple of points to check:
* I changed the guide to use the directories `/mnt/hdd/bitcoin_testnet/` and I will use `/mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet`later on. 
* You could have everything in the same directory, but with two directories, you just delete the symbolic link `/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin`and point it to the other directory (including the correct `bitcoin.conf`) with the `ln -s ....` command to switch
* so I would create a separate directory for mainnet, copy the blockchain data in it, setup `bitcoin.conf`completely without the "testnet" line (you do not need to have "testnet=0")
* I would also create a backup of the directory in case something goes wrong (otherwise you might need to rebuild the blockchain again...) --&gt; check out the `tar` command for that, eg. `tar cvf /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet_20180227.tar /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet/`

It makes sense to use the Linux-native file system "ext4" for reliable operations. As an alternative, NTFS is quite unreliable and a common issue when included in an earlier version of the guide. So, the guide uses ext4 only.  
Connecting an ext4 hard disk to Windows computers is hard (not sure about macOS) and only possible with additional (paid) software. This is why copying the blockchain using SCP is the easiest option for beginners (also: SCP, not SFTP, which leads to other issues).

You should do that every so often anyway. 130 MB is quite a big package, but that's ok, nonetheless. It goes to the SD card, but hopefully you have some space left.
You can `sudo apt-get autoremove`afterwards to clear unused stuff.
You should be able to upgrade everything with running services.

This sounds like you don't have write-permissions on the external hdd. What file system are you using? (ntfs, ext4...) 
Does the following command give you an error?
    touch /mnt/hdd/test.file
Can you run this command with the user "pi" without error?
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:34:43
Can you please paste that in a readable way? :-)
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:23:28
What I see is, that
* you have created the Segwit address
* all of your funds are in that one p2sh-of-p2wpkh address
* you unlocked your Bitcoin Core wallet for 10 mins
* the channel was created (probabliy within these 10 mins)
* the channel was CLOSED due to "insufficient funds"
I really cannot see why this wouldn't work. I had these issues myself, but I always missed one of the steps I checked above... You might want to talk to ACINQ directly, either
* by chat: 
* opening an issue: 
Let me know if you find out anything. AFAIK the next release is scheduled for this week, maybe this helps?
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:05:21
Are you running on the Odroid HC2? Or on a Raspberry Pi?
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:46:33
See here for estimated bandwith for Bitcoin Core. It is possible to throttle that, though, is on my todo-list for the guide.
Not sure about Lightning yet.
@_date: 2018-03-03 12:47:59
With Samourai wallet (highly recommended), it is possible to broadcast (send) transactions using your own Full Node. This is useful for privacy. 
Unfortunately, I do not know about a mobile wallet that can connect to your full node for receiving and validating transactions. This is maybe because the RPC api interface of bitcoind is not suitable for this, I hope that Neutrino could help with that, if it would be supported by bitcoind, but I'm no expert in this.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:13:52
This probably means that you try to access the Eclair API without the eclair.api.password that you set in the eclair.conf
You can either
* give the pw as a parameter like `eclair-cli -p MYPASS getinfo`
* edit the eclair-cli and store the password inside (as done in the guide) --&gt; check the part with `nano bin/eclair-cli`
If you already did that, maybe try a simpler password without special characters.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:44:59
Yes, it's important to publish your own public IP address (not starting with 192.168....., that's the internal one) so that the worldmap can locate you (at least on the right continent).
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:51:01
One caveat: the public IP is only passed to LND when the service is startet. I am not sure how to change it afterwards, but a service restart once a day could easily be scheduled as well.
The IP is only relevant for the announcement (like listing on the LND explorer), the payment network itself doesn't need a public IP for routing at all and handles this internally.
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:46:47
I think I need to add a section about using the command line. The following is true for PuTTY under Windows:
* you can copy everything inside SSH to your clipboard by selecting it with your mouse (no click necessary)
* you can paste at the current cursor position by right-click
* additionally, you can use the [tab] key to auto-complete commands, directories or filenames 
So you can copy the node address in your Windows browser, enter `eclair-cli send ` and right-click anywhere in the SSH window.
Does that help?
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:38:15
Are you using the new guide on github?
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:51:25
Yes, this is how you connect to the network and will be able to move value.
@_date: 2018-11-25 13:53:47
Basically none. You should run a Bitcoin full node to participate in the peer-to-peer network, validate your own transactions and not leak private information to centrailized services.
For Lightning it's the same. Run a node if you want to use and learn about the network. Routing payments will not cover your expenses at the moment.
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:17:14
Did you try unlocking it longer? Are any of your outputs locked?
@_date: 2018-02-07 20:19:19
You mean copy to the external drive for the Pi? Yes, as long as the blockchain is indexed with txindex=1
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:17:25
Things that have nothing to do with your sync process:
- UFW (you can still disable it completely with `sudo systemctl disable ufw`and `sudo systemctl stop ufw`to be sure)
- IP forwarding or connectivity type (wireless or wired)
I see that your Pi is under heavy load (which is not bad, this should stop once you're synced). And at the moment, I have 85 "block"-files on testnet, so you're getting there. Maybe the hard disk (or the USB interface in the enclosure) is the bottleneck, hard to tell.
Did the coins show up yet? As I said, I'm not sure if they actually should. I'd just wait until your node is operational. You might also start downloading the main chain (see follow-up guide), if that takes this long... ;-)
@_date: 2018-02-08 05:47:53
Alpha10 is due this week and should solve this 
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:35:14
Thanks. :-D
This is just a basic MotD shell script that's greeting me on login. Still WiP, I will share as soon as it's finished.
@_date: 2018-02-04 10:01:24
Please make sure that all installation is done as user "Pi", but only user "bitcoin" can use `bitcoin-cli`. This is intentional, as this user cannot alter the system.
As "bitcoind" runs with user "bitcoin", all configuration, home directory etc. needs to be in /home/bitcoin/... 
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:31:59
Cannot say for sure. What says the following as user "pi"?
    $ which java
    /usr/bin/java
    $ java -version
    java version "1.8.0_65"
    Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)
    Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)
Check the log files
    $ sudo journalctl -u eclair
    $ tail -n 100 /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log
Can you start eclair from the command line, as user "bitcoin"?
    $ /usr/bin/java -jar /home/bitcoin/eclair/eclair-node.jar &amp;
    $ tail -f /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log
If needed, you can kill the eclair process with `sudo pkill -9 -f eclair`.
@_date: 2018-03-21 19:34:43
Next thing on my list. And feel free to provide your own examples by pull request. :-)
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:51:34
I would think so, yes. Make sure to retrace all the steps, there might be slight changes. And disable the eclair.service, that's about it.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:05:47
Hm, I'm really struggling to understand why this does not work. Hard if there are no real error messages. 
* The symbolic link (/home/bitcoin/.bitcoin --&gt; /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_testnet) is working? Check with `ls -la /home/bitcoin`, the link must not be red (like [here](
* check if group "bitcoin" exists: `grep bitcoin /etc/group` (should output something like "bitcoin:x:1001:")
* Try to set the owner of the directory (with user "pi") `sudo chown -R bitcoin:bitcoin /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_testnet`
As user "bitcoin", try starting bitcoind without special configuration
* disable (rename) your bitcoin.conf `mv /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/bitcoin.backup`
* run `bitcoind -daemon -disablewallet -testnet -txindex`
* follow startup process (hopefully) with `tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log`
If that does not work, let's try running it without the external hdd (just temporarily):
* Remove symbolic link `rm /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin`
* start bitcoind manually like above
If it runs, you can stop bitcoind with `bitcoin-cli stop`, but only once it's fully up and running (can take some minutes). If that does not work (no rpcuser set), you can always kill it (with user "pi") with `sudo pkill -9 -f bitcoind`
Let's hope for the best...

I love to tinker and build stuff. I am also fascinated with digital currencies, so I built my own Bitcoin / Lightning Full Node with a simple low-cost Raspberry Pi. I now basically run my own bank using free open-source software and some cheap hardware.
This project was as much about the learning process as about the result. And I think I succeeded: I learned a lot and my node runs very well. This guide is my attempt to share my learnings and encourage you to run a node yourself.
You can follow me [ on Twitter for updates.

Thanks, I updated that part. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:02:12
1) Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) have been announced by LND "beyond beta" in their [Release Notes]( so still work in progress. Will be the next big thing, I guess.
Best option would probably be to close the channel and create a new one with sufficient funds manually. You cannot "top up" an existing channel without a new on-chain tx anyway, afaik.
2) Sent you a private message. :-)
@_date: 2018-03-10 13:59:15
You can simply rewrite the SD card and start over. The HDD will be formatted anyway.
Where did you get stuck? Any points that are unclear? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:03:53
You may be able to earn fees for routing payments and providing liquidity to the network by committing Bitcoin in a payment channel others can use.
In on-chain Bitcoin transactions, fees are depending on the transaction size in bytes, as the blocksize is scarce. In Lightning️, fees depend on the monetary value sent, as the available liquidity is the scarce element.
Fees will be minimal, though, don't expect to get rich... ��
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:00:12
Not on this mini-computer, no. You can run Bitcoin Core and a Lightning client on Windows, but I would not recommend running a "server" node this way. The idea is to have this running 24/7, for that Linux is perfect.

Thanks for shilling! ��
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:24:46
Doesn't say much, as the first entry is "shutting down" already. Can you reproduce the issue and use

@_date: 2018-03-02 07:14:05
No, primary usage is as personal Bitcoin &amp; Lightning wallet, plus routing Lightning payments for others (maybe earn minimal fees)

This lightning node works and can be used to make payments, but also to receive payments (on testnet at the moment). With the Lightning network, you cannot just send to an address, the receiver has to generate a unique "invoice" (see [Starblocks]( as an example). 
If you do not want to create these invoices manually on the command line, you need an API that creates these automatically.
Check out
* [Lightning Charge]( a native, non-custodian Lightning ecommerce integration, also using LND (so you could possibly integrate it with the Thundroid)
* [Acinq Strike]( a Lightning API service (custodial to a certain amount you define) by the makers of Eclair, that collects Lightning payments for you and sends you Bitcoin on-chain
Both very interesting projects. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:34:26
Thanks for your feedback. Yes, rpcauth could be added, but is not needed in this setup, unless you want to control your bitcoind from another machine.
Using the local user "bitcoin", authentication is handled via cookie, and Eclair Lightning is depending on the rpcuser / rpcpass for the moment.
I guess, they will switch to rpcauth in the near future.
@_date: 2018-02-25 07:52:16
Yes, the channel is now open until you close it. The coins backing the channel have been spent in the funding TX to a multisig address, so your Bitcoin wallet is no longer involved. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:11:56
Thanks for the hint, that was definitely a typo. Just corrected it.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:08:06
I try to set up the Strike Lightning service by ACINQ, primarily to experiment setting up a tip jar on testnet. Pointless, I know, but interesting to me... ;-)
I run a full Bitcoin node, including wallet and Lightning. I would like to use this wallet to get the funds on-chain from Strike. For that, I need the XPUB key (no problem with Ledger or other wallets).
**How can I get the XPUB key from the Bitcoin Core wallet?**
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:22:32
No, this is still the Linux user. Password B is meant to secure the bitcoind RPC interface.

@_date: 2019-01-02 16:03:08
In regards to the Bitcoin network, a node is a node. It depends what you do with it, but that's not a question of computing power. A node only makes sense if you use it as an "economic node" to send transactions (improve your privacy) and/or receive transactions (verify them yourself). If it sits idle, it does not add much value to the network.  
Note that this is unrelated to mining bitcoin. Miners also need a Bitcoin node to get the current network status and gather transactions to put into a new block. But the acutal mining is not happening on a Bitcoin node, but dedicated mining hardware.
@_date: 2018-03-01 22:20:08

@_date: 2018-02-23 07:30:11
Hm, up until now it's just the opening of the channel and then a lot of unrelated gossip. Eclair works with a "queue" where actions need to wait in line. Maybe your node is still to busy to process the request in time? Could you wait some time and grep everything regarding that channel?
    cat /home/bitcoin/.eclair/eclair.log | grep 024c873f489141f6581c78a8af32a6209eb23847ca55c18b4032e6789af1abfcd0
If it does not work after some hours, you might want to open an issue with the Eclair project. They are very helpful and working hard to improve the software also for low-end hardware.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:13:11
Thats the Raspbian distribution "version", should be fine. The problem is that your bitcoind does not start at all... You should always be able to start it from the command line. Maybe try without any options? Or download it again, in case it's corrupted. Otherwise, I'm at a loss, maybe open an issue at  ... 
@_date: 2018-03-04 20:52:33
No, the issue I was describing is for your Lightning node to know its own public IP adress (numerical) and announce it to other nodes.
If you want to connect to your node from the outside, Dynamic DNS is your friend. You basically have a service running, that let's a 3rd party service (like dynu.com) know your current IP address. This 3rd party provides you with a internet address (eg. raspibolt.dynu.com) that always points to your ip address.
See here:
You can then use this address in Samurai wallet to connect to your own Bitcoin full node, yay! :-)
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:05:30


Did you use that password, or change it? Maybe try something simple, like `ABCD`.
And maybe use `RestartSec=30`in "bitcoind.service", I just updated the configuration file here:
Does this command work? It creates a test file to check if your user has write-access to the directory:
    touch /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/test.file
    touch /mnt/hdd/test2.file
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:26:10
Hi Luccio, I wouldn't worry about the coins at the moment, but on the download / verifications speed. The Port forwarding is also not important at this time. But: you have 12 blocks, in what time exactly? There are over 1.2 million blocks... (one every 10 mins).
What is your setup? Pi, external hdd, internet speed.
Can you run `w` and paste the top line?
@_date: 2018-02-23 21:27:03
I can think of a few things:
* maybe the wallet was locked again once the funding tx was sent
* not all coins have been sent p2sh-of-p2wpkh address
Otherwise, maybe a Bitcoin wallet output is locked (see my issue on GitHub  Try reproducing with it 
* `bitcoin-cli listlockunspent` 
* `bitcoin-cli listunspent` 
If this is the case, please document in the issue on Github, as this is still unresolved.

Can you check, if the .bitcoin directory is actually linked to the hdd?

@_date: 2018-02-03 01:09:29
Check the log `eclair.log` for insufficient funds. Either not enough tBTC, a locked Bitcoin wallet or not all funds sent to Segwit (the part with the witness address) could be the culprit. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 06:39:37
Nice, thanks for your feedback! 
For the switch, you need to copy the whole mainnet blockchain directory (including all subfolders) to a new folder, eg. `/mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet`. I would download it on your regular computer, see this guide:
Make sure to stop bitcoind and lnd. After that copy the whole directory content into the new directory `bitcoin_mainnet` and edit the file `bitcoin.conf` (remove the line with `testnet=1` completely).
Before starting the services again, create a backup of the whole mainnet directory, in case something goes wrong or the tx index becomes corrupted.
`tar cvf /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet_20180308.tar /mnt/hdd/bitcoin_mainnet/` (
After that, delete the symbolic link and create a new one with `ln -s ...` pointing to the mainnet directory. Now you should be able to start bitcoind again. You don't need to start LND as it will fail, it is not yet mainnet compatible.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:32:18
Hej Elavid, I just updated the guide with your feedback, thanks again! :-)
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:20:59
Not sure how Bitcoin Core handles this. My guess it shows in "unconfirmed" until everything is synced. But could be differetn. 
For you to send the funds to a Segwit address (with the witness) you need to have the blockchain fully synced, unless you want to fiddle with sending unconfirmed coins and stuff. Not recommended... ;-)
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:32:26
No problem, keep me posted. :-)
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:48:31
I don't think that will amount to much. If your external hard disk is the bottleneck on your regular computer, this will also be the case on the Pi, and worse. Not sure why this would take **that** long.
As a reference, I downloaded the mainnet blockchain with txindex=1 from scratch in 18 hours, using a 4 year old desktop computer and an external HDD (2+ years old, but USB3).
Either download to your internal hard disk (if you have the space) or use a faster USB3 external HDD and then copy it to the Pi HDD.
Another alternative is  but I am not sure if this is fully indexed. I just shot him/her an email, let's see... :-)
@_date: 2018-02-22 09:19:06
Is your bitcoind already fully synced? Check with `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo` (with user "bitcoin")
 
Maybe try a very simple username / password at first? There are sometimes complications with special characters.
 
You can also try starting Eclair manually to get the output directly (exit with ctrl-c), with user "bitcoin"
    java -jar /home/bitcoin/eclair/eclair-node.jar
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:14:45
This shows your internal network address, not reachable from the outside. Try to get your external IP address here: 
After changing your `eclair.conf`you can then restart eclair (as "pi") with `sudo systemctl restart eclair`
@_date: 2018-02-22 17:54:51
I guess we are maxing out the Pi's performance as it is... wouldn't recommend a GUI. ;-)
I just let it boot and then interact with SSH, a browser, medium (and Spotify) from my desktop. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:27:08
According to the command help it expects the funding TX as argument?
According to the latest release notes, there's a command
lncli closeallchannels
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:48:52
You won't be able to sync it initially on the Pi directly. The guide explains how to do it on a regular comuter and then copy the blockchain via ethernet with SCP. After that, the Pi can keep up.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:00:37
Will do, definitely this week. ��‍��
@_date: 2018-02-18 14:09:49
Regarding shutdown: only the admin user "pi" can restart the system, that's on purpose. 
I would always log into the system as "pi" and then open a session as user "bitcoin" with `sudo su bitcoin`. You can then exit this session with `exit` back into your "pi" user and run the `shutdown`command.
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:41:34
Sorry, did somehow miss that comment earlier. Yes, the user "bitcoin" is supposed to configure everything bitcoin &amp; lightning related and has access to all these application directories. The user "pi" is system admin and can change global parameters (with the command "sudo").
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:11:22
Will have a look at it, thanks for the feedback! And good to learn that transactions only show up once the node is up to speed. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 16:37:26
What command do you use exactly? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:32:20
As Bitcoin Core now has native Segwit support and Eclair still uses the now deprecated rpcargument "Make sure to include the argument addwitnessaddress, bitcoind needs to be started with `deprecatedrpc=addwitnessaddress` in the bitcoin.conf, otherwise Eclair won't be able to open channels due to the now native Segwit support of Bitcoin Core. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 23:55:51
I think I deciphered it. Looks good. 
* Did you install `ntfs-3g`
* If it does not work, you can format the external hdd with `mkntfs`and try to mount it again (the UUID changes)
* If you want to avoid NTFS issues, you can format as ext4, which is perfect for linux (but you won't be able to attach the disk to a windows computer without additional drivers): `mkfs -t ext4 /dev/sd???`
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:11:35
Besides initial cost, there's primarily cost associated with internet bandwidth. I wouldn't run it for profit, maybe it will amount to some pocket change, but the main point is for personal use, learning and helping to kickstart the decentralized Lightning network.
@_date: 2018-03-03 10:12:01
Nothing, it's still on testnet. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:49:45
Same at my end, it rolls up the whole blockchain in the background. You can follow this process with journalctl. Give it some time.
 Could you check how long it takes for future reference? I don't know, I just let it run overnight. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 23:20:17
Hi, are you already on mainnet? This can happen if you have a testnet wallet and switch to mainnet and create a new wallet with a different password. In that case, I would delete the .lnd folder and start on mainnet from scratch.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:19:06
FYI: I could reproduce your error both on a Raspberry Pi and on the Odroid HC2. As it was working 3 weeks before, this has to be a change in the LND code. 
I opened an issue on the LND project: 
@_date: 2018-03-18 11:37:06
What do you mean with 64MB RAM? The Pi is already a bit constained with 1 **GB**, more is better. What hardware do you plan to use?
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:43:36
This is probably a timeout error, as Eclair is still processing a lot of network chatter in the backend. See my issue report ( it's classified as a known bug and will be fixed.
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:50:05
You can just install it over the current version, following the guide as you would the first time. Just like you described. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:20:51

I'd recommend opening an issue on their Github repo. RaspiBlitz is based on my RaspiBolt guide, but I am not directly involved with the project.

A wallet (software or hardware) basically stores your keys. This this one half of what makes you finacial independent. 
To send a transaction, however, this is not enoug, as you need to connect to the Bitcoin p2p network. This is usually handled by a centralized service, even for Ledger or Trezor hw wallets.
The same goes for verifying incoming transactions. You need to know the state of the Bitcoin blockchain to be sure that you actually received coins. Without your own copy of the blockchain, you just rely on someone else to tell you the truth.
These services are fine and much needed, but you could see them as a banking service (sending coins, updating your wallet balance...), even if you control your own keys. 
Running your own full node is the other half of your financial independence and gets rid of the trust you need to place in that central service.

That directory should be created once LND is started and the wallet is created.   
* Have you already created your wallet successfully?
* Are you on Testnet? (the mainnet directory is different)
Feel free to open an issue on Github, these are easier to track than here on reddit.

The bottleneck is the Bitcoin full node, validating transactions. I wouldn't recommend using a Pi Zero, as the limited RAM and CPU will max out at some point.
Running LND with Neutino or similar techniques without the full node below, however, is not a problem.

Autopilot? See github issue for more details.

It's not a perfect solution, as there is no graceful shutdown (a battery would be needed for that to power the Pi for at least a few minutes), but it usually can handle power cuts and starts again when the power is restored.
Worst case, however, could be that the blockchain data is currently being written and get's somehow corrupted.

I'm also very interested in the replies! ����

There are subtle differences between Raspbian and Ubuntu, but most stuff works for both distros. Check out my "Thundroid" guide in the same Github repo, that builds on Ubuntu.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:13:29
The current Raspberry Pi is actually version 3, so the Pi2 is quite outdated. Should work though, as it has the same CPU architecture (as opposed to Pi1 or PiZero).
@_date: 2018-12-02 07:47:12
This should not take longer than a few hours, mainly to convert the data structure. The blocks are not validated from scratch. Is this still an issue? What does the log say?
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:36:53
Awesome! ��‍����

Yes, I'm aware that it's very low level. As a complete beginner, it makes only sense if you're interested in learning linux on the way and have a decent amount of time and some stamina. But I'm happy to help and questions are regularly anwered on Github (in the issues section).

Electrum is working on Lightning integration:

Ah, I see. Not sure exactly what the consequences are. Could you elaborate what that means exactly? 
I experience probably similar issues when running a node over cellular data (tethered to my mobile phone), as you get your own IP address, but there's no way to route incoming connections to devices connected through that.
In that situation, the node still works though, as you can connect to Bitcoin peers from your end, and open channels with other nodes. But nobody will be able to directly connect to your node from the outside.
Is that comparable to your situation?
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:22:37
I hope the guide is straight forward and pretty refined by now. But it's hard to tell where you might get stuck. If you don't pressure yourself, you should be able to do it with some spare time over a few weekends.
Also, happy to help, just open a Github issue. But responses are not instant, obviously.
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:46:05
Yep. But you can still pay your coffee from home and get it later when it's cold... ;-)

The Tor guide builds on top of the RaspiBolt guide that uses "Raspbian Stretch". It's not possible to have both a very generic guide for various operating systems and still be beginner friendly. I added a note regarding the required os version to the guide, however.  
I also changed the \`lnd.conf\` section. Technically, the location of arguments do not matter, but I agree it's not very clear.  
Thanks for pointing these topics out!

I don't think anything is holding Lightning back from being used. The progess is incredible for a project that started a bit over a year ago. Tons of stuff is being built and new use-cases are discovered every day. Sometimes it's hard to remember that building systems like this is **really** hard and takes time.
The same goes for Segwit. It's adopted organically and nobody is forced to use it, as it's purely opt-in. This only shows how hard it is to "upgrade" decentralized distributed systems. The adoption curve is rising, so I don't think there's any reason to worry in that regard.

Hardkernel makes the great Odroid XU4 SBC. If you want to connect other stuff to it (like physical buttons or displays), this is the way to go: quite powerful and 2 GB of RAM.
The same hardware, but with limited I/O is used for the Odroid HC1, which provides an integrated hard disk / ssd case. It's a great choice for a full node. See my Thundroid guide here:

AFAIK that works without issues. However, I don't think that a real business should rely on a RPi for 24/7 availability, a VPS seems better suited for that.  
@_date: 2018-12-12 09:20:39
Not really. You can earn some pennies in fees, but at the moment awesomeness is the main motivation! :-)

Bitcoind and LND are able to handle that in most situations, using UPnP and communicating directly with your router. If your public IP changes, this information is updated on the p2p network. No need for a static IP address or domain name.

Thanks for this very thorough review of your experience with my guide. I'm always trying to improve, so very helpful! ��

There shouldn't be severe consequences, it's just the responsibility of your node to keep the connections and payment channels to your peers alive. 
The biggest challenge will probably be receiving funds over LN, as no other nodes can connect to your node to provide incoming liquidity.
