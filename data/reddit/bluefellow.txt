Nope. I never said it was useless nor did I ever talk about other forms of payment. I just talked about some of it's weaknesses. It seems a lot of people don't want to discuss anything remotely negative about bitcoin. Or if you do you have to include a bunch 'but it does this well...".

More resistant to what exactly? A stable value? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:55:06
A weakness of Bitcoin is that it can only be traded electronically, yes...
I certainly don't think requiring electronic communication is close to being it's biggest weakness. Nor do I think Bitcoin should have anything changed to counter this weakness. It's part of what makes it what it is. That does not change the fact that it is a weakness though...........................

What's in my comment history? 


I'm not lecturing you...


Good for you I guess, I don't know you. 


Again, I don't know you, I don't really care about your personal economics.

So you can't. Fake money is a problem sure. It doesn't answer or relate to my question though. I also have no reason not to admit problems in any currency. 
I don't know what the consensus problem is. But I do know of some problems Bitcoin address and other problems it creates. I am curious though, why do you view being able to print more money an issue? 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:40:55
Which country are you in? In most Western countries, that's not right and you can take legal action. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:12:19
It still requires electronic communication of some sort. To some people that is a weakness.

How do you use Bitcoins offline? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:37:06
Bitcoin is not their competition though. If Bitcoin becomes mainstream, there will be Bitcoin banks and you will want them. Banks are not currencies and currencies do not compete against banks. 
You are not required to have a bank account and you can store your traditional currency under your bed if you want. There are benefits to having a bank though and massive benefits to having a currency with lenders. Bitcoin will never be mainstream without people like Capital One dealing directly with it.

Do you think if Zimbabwe was not allowed to print money, their economy would be fine? Printing money wasn't the problem in those places. Printing money was a reaction to an underlying problem. 
Do you know why governments print money in the first place? 
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:17:22
I wouldn't close the account. It's good to keep those around. Just use it here and there. It's good to have long term credit history. 
It's likely they consider cryptocurrency an investment and investments are generally not allowed on credit cards. Investing on credit usually requires some sort of collateral. Look at the top posts of and they're all investment related, so their view really isn't bad.

You moved the goal posts, answering my questions with questions instead of answers which moved the discussion, don't blame me. You're doing it again. More answers with questions that are slightly changing the topic.

...Governments denying electronic communication to protesters is not a bizarre concept. Neither is a hurricane knocking out infrastructure...

 &gt;Capital One continues to closely monitor developments in cryptocurrency markets and exchanges and will regularly evaluate the decision as cryptocurrency markets evolve.

She ignored the debt for two years and you think it's unfair that she can't access her money? The creditor can only freeze the amount of money owed to them in the account. The creditor has exhausted their options to get the money from her, all of which were ignored. They're done dealing with her. 
Her account is frozen so she can't run away with the money. The creditor cannot take the money right away to give her a chance to fight back in court if it's wrongly frozen, otherwise in time, that money belongs to the creditor. She already had her chance to pay on her terms and blew it over and over again.

Can you walk me through this? Let's say I want to buy something from you. It's a $100 item. I cannot do any electronic communication during this sale. How would you give me $100 in bitcoin and how would I confirm that is $100 in bitcoin without trusting you? If you hand me a private key on a piece of paper, how do I know you didn't print out a copy? How do I verify how much is there? 
@_date: 2018-01-25 23:40:12
No access to electronic communication.

The comment tried to make 1,500 ATMs sound like a lot. It's not. Bitcoin's ecosystem is non-existent next to established currencies. Very few places accept it. Virtually none. Bitcoin is failing as a currency. It's acceptance in major stores is dropping. $20 a transaction and only 3 transactions a second. Wether you want to compare Bitcoin to established currencies or look at it on it's own, it's failing. 
Bitcoin is a niche investment in a small market today. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:30:52
It's failing as a currency, so in my view it's failing since that's the intended purpose. 
Also there are futures for a lot of things. You can get futures on how much a specific freight route will handle.

His firm lost %5 in 2017. Meanwhile S&amp;P 500 went up %19 and the NASDAQ went up %28. I'd be concerned of anything this guy touches.

When bitcoin gets banks what will stop bitcoin banks from doing the same thing? Bitcoin would replace the currency the bank deals in, not the bank. Bitcoin will never have widespread use or ever be competitive on a wide scale if there are no banks for it. Lenders are essential. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:06:37
Since 2013 there really hasn't been any success. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:00:10
The fuck banks mentality is weird. Bitcoin doesn't compete with banks. If Bitcoin is to be succesful you need Bitcoin banks.

Ah, it's not an uncommon view so it was hard to tell :P
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:42:54
Yah but on you need to be careful. Here a strong currency is one that only deflates. Banks are the enemy and their lending services aren't needed in a future economy. We're all going to be millionaires and Wall Street can suck it. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:01:58
 Fractional reserve banking can be done on any currency or asset. Bitcoin or the US dollar is irrelevant to that.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:09:19


Perhaps that's the problem?  It shouldn't be there to make money, it should be money. Deflation is not good for a currency either. Some will argue deflation is worse than inflation even. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:55:12
Just google effects of deflation and read around...

How is bitcoin competition? Banks are not currencies nor do they compete with currencies... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:02:15
How does bitcoin get rid of banks? Bitcoin is supposed to take the role of a currency. Ideally you'd want banks dealing in bitcoin.

Deflation is awful for a currency and ruins the banking system entirely though.

Not really though. A big fuck you to Ferrari would have been beating them in Formula 1 or at least somewhere on the track. Ferrari only sold road cars to fund their racing. Lamborghini never cared for racing.
