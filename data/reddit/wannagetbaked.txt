So it's creating a sensational event which will cause a rush of people to buy it driving it up until again the founders pull the rug out and sell off into the rally - it will have a draining effect on all listed Cryptos as people pull money out of their other coins to throw into bitcoin cash to catch a bit of the action. Coinbase adding it has lended additional legitimacy to the process of hard forking off Bitcoin. This will likely encourage every asshole with some VC money to fork off of Bitcoin for very little reason other than greed.

Okay fine. Are we thinking these AIs would be like human conciousness? With or drives and motivations? An emulation of the biological?

Okay but thats assuming its created already. Will all these options be programed in? These are the clouds available and these are the.... omg it just struck me. Theses problems themselves are valuable to be solved by agents. 
So there could be agents that publisize metrics in clouds. And agents that host repositories that allow programmers to upload code blocks for agents to try out.
There could be matching agents who help other agents find other succesful agents.
I wonder though would they ever really achieve indepence.

Well he's being asked if they can serve as a fiduciary for retirement accounts holding bitcoin.  I think the opportunity there is amazing.
Where things are sticky is we are wondering if he even has to hold the Bitcoin. What we are hoping is that the bank can serve as an accounting and reporting vehicle for 401ks and IRAs composed of Bitcoin. All they would do is internally marry your identity to a wallet address and monitor it for reporting.
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:18:47

This could work but it would have to be tiny amounts. And done more as a come get your  here or maybe just a sponsored faucet.
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:18:11
401k, Roth IRA, IRA, HSP, 403b, 529, SEP IRA are examples of accounts that we would try to make bitcoin friendly. The idea is to enable people to either buy bitcoins pre-tax or shelter future Bitcoin appreciation from taxes.
@_date: 2015-02-28 18:39:47
If you are still using them... 
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:10:32
Why? they can just buy in at a whim and engage in all kinds of currency manipulation with the assets at their disposal they could probably even get a 51% miner situation going. Should they decide to. Nothing prevents Bitcoin from being exploited by oligarchs even if we switch to a different monopoly money they still own all the hotels.

@_date: 2013-02-23 07:14:02
I see so you would say that at least some portion of the bitcoin community would be sophisticated enough to figure out what is happening and play the market appropriately in that scenario. What if he simply invested in a super computer that had other practical uses but happened to be able to severely over power the current hashrate?

Yea the lack of truly solid alternatives to mtgox is a little disconcerting. They could profit heavily with minor manipulation.
Also I don't quite understand where new blocks come from and how the complexity is calculated. How is this not a security vector?

Think of grinding a character in an mmorpg. The amount of time it would take to get that level of credit should discourage casual fraud. I am no actuarial but I think that there are more people in the world that are creditable and will pay you back than there are fraudsters. Eeither way they percentage of deliquency can be worked into the risk profile for new accounts. Like lending club.com

I have watched bitcoin for over 3 years now. I had technical support for the price level of $25. 
This was a very obvious speculative explosion plenty of people lost money here now and tons of people are calling it a bubble. The interest level will subside but the rest of us will carry on.
@_date: 2013-02-23 07:05:22
if bitcoin was perceived as a threat to the oligarchical stranglehold on banking?

The Bitcoin stores are still very early in their adoption. No Amazon has not started taking Bitcoin.
Volatility in an asset with built in deflation isn't the worst thing. Speculation and the wild media attention Bitcoin receives inflates the price in accordance with speculative bubbles.
