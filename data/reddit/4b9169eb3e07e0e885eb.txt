Oh, didn't know that, thought multisig keys were strings of random characters. Could you point me to more information please?

Right but now is too late for it, can't get shipment without shipping address. Earliest I can buy Trezor is Feb next year.

I want to use Electrum on Raspberry Pi as my cold storage (because of HD seed feature), only powered up and online when sending coins (hodler, so very rarerly), but I'm freaking out that PRNG might be compromised or something and my coins will get stolen. On the other hand I never heard of anyone losing their coins because of Electrum, but as said I'm afraid of the risk. I don't want to use paper wallets, and can't use hardware wallet for time being. What do you think?

GreenAddress seems to be HD and have multisig, but I'm not sure how I feel about web wallets after recent blockchain.info fiasco. Think I'll stick to dice roll trick as mentioned by another user below, should be good enough for couple of months until I get Trezor. Thanks for your help.

I don't want to use multisig neither, I am not technically inclined and I don't trust myself with keeping it secure and prevent from losing access to coins. With Electrum I can memorize seed, hide it scattered among my belongings and feel fairly safe. I have quite large stash (400+) which is 99.9% of my money, so I'm shitting bricks as you can imagine. But you gave me idea, I can generate seed on my desktop and recreate wallet on Raspberry Pi, that should work. Next year I'll get Trezor, unable now due to logistics.

I know, but I don't want backups that require digital storage which can get corrupted, lost or stolen.

Thanks, the dice method looks very good, I'll try that first.
