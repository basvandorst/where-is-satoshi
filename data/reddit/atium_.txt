He has skin in the game. That's worth a lot more than a random providing an opinion on something he doesn't own.

You can run a full node from scratch with geth's --fast-sync flag, where it will pull a recent state database and go from there. This works fine for me even on old hardware and syncs within a few hours.

Then at least do so with a link

Then you are going to have a tough time communicating with people.
When some say regulating bitcoin, for you it means 'regulating everything else but bitcoin'. When someone says they want to regulate and legalize bitcoin, I'm pretty sure they don't really mean they want to regulate transaction size and other properties of bitcoin.

Yeah, but only for the syncing stage. When it reaches the current block it performs full validation (and fully validates new transactions) and functions as a full node. 
So you are able to easily *run* a full node, just not validate the entire history as easily.
The --light flag starts up a thinner client.
