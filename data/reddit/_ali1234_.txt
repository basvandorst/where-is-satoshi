It isn't using the bitcoin port. It is connecting to the bitcoin port on another IP. There is no reason why that can't happen while you are running bitcoind.

No. Bitcoin is "purposefully not turing complete".

| You can add an incentive to remove money from circulation by paying interest on locked funds. (Like a deposit.)
This doesn't remove money from the economy. It increases it.
BitShares and NuBits are just two of the failed experiments I was talking about. BitShares are worth nothing. NuBits' parking interest failed, so they adapted the system: now they mint NuShares and use them to buy up NuBits. As a result of the hyperinflation this caused they are now in the process of re-denominating NuShares such that 1 new NuShare = 10,000 old NuShares.

I told you why I call them failed: BitShares are worthless, NuBits are propped up by sales of NuShares which are worthless as a result. Market cap is completely meaningless when inflation is so high and volume is so low.

Three times as worthless as Dogecoin, yes.

This has already been tried in multiple altcoins. The problem is that all you can do is inflate the money supply. You can never remove money from the system, so you can only force the price in one direction: down. As a result, all attempts have failed, with the price approaching zero.

Because reddit is more than 1002 people and each sub is basically a filter bubble with it's own unique type of groupthink.

And who could step in and host it instead, short notice?

How much are bitshares worth these days anyway?
@_date: 2016-01-21 18:55:07
Yes. Ideally it should only allow "buy it now" sales. I don't want to place a bid and then wait for a week to see if I won it or not and then repeat the process indefinitely. I just want to buy it now without having to worry about over-paying because of shill bids.

Also github stats only consider the top 100 committers, making it look like development is more centralized than it really is.

If you build a dam then tear it down you get a flood that wouldn't have happened had the dam never existed.

What is the point of the "tab" then?

One possibility is that they would do it to remove their own liability. Who do you sue if you get run over by a self-owning car? It's basically a really stupid idea in every way *except* from the point of view of self-driving car manufacturers/operators.

The article doesn't use it to justify a block size increase.

Still doesn't show anything for my contribution.
I mean I only fixed a denial of service attack on nodes, so nothing important.
Also it's not really clear whether the *participants* is everybody who can claim, or just the people who have claimed, which is why I was confused before.
@_date: 2015-04-11 10:49:13
Well there is your problem. The ContributorStatistics API is capped at 100 results. Bitcoin has 288 contributors.
See 
So yes I'd say this is somewhat unfair, especially as there's no mention of how github chooses which 100 contributors to list.

FYI: Mobbr's algorithm is broken - it doesn't work the way the devs believe it does. See 
@_date: 2015-04-05 19:56:15
I can confirm it DOES NOT work. I can't figure out how to claim for my contributions and the site throws cryptic errors all over the place. Their help section is full of spam too.

This is wrong and dangerously incorrect. The fact that the images are 8 bits per channel combined with the fact that the source information is 1 bit per pixel means that each pixel effectively has 23 bits of redundancy and there is a high chance of recovering the information even if you don't know the convolution parameters. Or put more simply, the fact that it was black and white before it was blurred make it much easier to reverse. Source: I have coded software which does exactly this.
Here's a paper on the subject, one of many:

That's really cool. I didn't expect it would happen that fast.
edit: Also I just noticed the thanks to in the proposal. A rare Bitcoin critic who actually makes insightful and useful observations, he doesn't get enough respect imo, so that's nice to see.
