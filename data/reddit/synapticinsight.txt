Gox apparently took bitcoin withdrawals offline.

BTC isn't any less refundable than cash. Also, there's nothing against refunding somebody with cash if they paid in bitcoin.

Out of curiosity, how do you do this? Generate and revoke starbucks giftcards on the fly, that is. I understand if you don't want to share, but I'm genuinely curious.

They automatically send a copy to my email anyway. If both Google and Blockchain's datacenters get destroyed, I'm pretty sure I'll have bigger problems to worry about than losing my bitcoins.


I don't know much about the bitcoinica case, but after some googling I see that the issue was that their master password was compromised. I don't see how that is a bigger security issue (in context) than your wallet encryption password being compromised directly. Either way your coins are gone.

Theoretically, Blockchain is no less secure than Electrum. They don't have copies of your private keys or passwords. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 17:28:37


Bullshit, I use a Blockchain.info wallet with 113 bits of entropy, which would take over ~~300~~ 150 million years for a GPU cluster that could brute force 1 quintillion passwords a second to crack. For reference, the fastest GPU cluster that we know of can't even do 1 quadrillion passwords a second yet. 
Anybody who encrypts their wallet with a weak password might as well not even use encryption in the first place. The encryption feature is there for a reason, you should take advantage of it rather than treating it as something that you shouldn't worry about.

Yeah, the one part that is vastly more computationally expensive than any other part. 


You're probably correct, but I wouldn't go jumping to conclusions either. As far as I see, the paper linked doesn't show any performance benchmarks, so I suppose we can only wait and see.

You take out your smartphone, open up your bitcoin wallet of choice, and send the payment using the QR code that the cashier will display for you.

I actually really like the idea. Your main bitcoin wallet is kind of like your bank account, and your NFC ring wallet is kind of like your wallet in real life - not very secure, and in the case of bitcoin, very convenient.
I would assume that you're rotating private keys each time money is added to the ring? This would ensure that any stolen private keys wouldn't be very useful, as long as people are smart enough not to put large sums of money onto their ring. If people follow good practices, then this shouldn't really be any less secure than an actual cash-filled wallet.

Personally, I use a password manager. However you can create an equally secure and memorable password using random english words.


So I don't have to download the blockchain or the blockchain headers. So I don't have extra software that I need to run on my computer just to send/receive bitcoins. So that I don't have to worry about backing up my wallet myself. So I have access to my wallet from anywhere in the world. Also, I like blockchain's interface. 


Such as?
IMO, blockchain is not much less secure then using a full desktop/phone client. In both cases, security is an issue. If I needed to store a *lot* of money, I would go with a paper wallet without even thinking twice. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:55:13
Best way (imo) would be to generate a bitcoin address on a machine that isn't connected to the internet and is running on a live CD (in order to ensure that malware isn't watching). Take that, write down or print out the private key and address. Shutdown the computer.
That's it. Now you can send funds to the address you wrote down, and the private key will never be compromised unless you physically lose the piece of paper.

And so the problem becomes one of redundancy.
@_date: 2013-11-16 23:57:50
If you wanted to get bitcoins out you would have to import the private key to a wallet software and make a transaction. However, keep in mind, that once you do this you lose many of the security benefits of paper wallets. The best use (imo) for a paper wallet is cold storage of bitcoins that you don't want to touch for a long time. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:24:06


This logic is somewhat flawed. If your computer is compromised then they will have access to both your wallet file and your encryption password. Since your computer being compromised is the most likely way of losing your locally stored bitcoins, two-factors practically turn into one. 


Correct, but I'm not relying on SMTP to secure my coins. I'm relying on AES-256. The wallet file isn't emailed unencrypted.

I may very well be an outlier, but my point is that encryption is implemented for a reason, and those that have a weak password should expect to suffer the consequences accordingly. It's their problem, not Blockchain.info's problem, if their password is weak.


I didn't use anybody's estimator, I did the math on my own. You simply divide the number of possible passwords by two times the rate at which passwords are tried in order to get the mean time to crack.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:46:46


I like how you quote the word "deserves" as if it came from me, even though I never used that word. No, the average person doesn't deserve to suffer for not being a security guru. However, life isn't exactly fair these days. It's just the fact of the matter here. If you use a weak password, there can and likely will be consequences. That applies to blockchain.info and any other site that protects your secrets with a password. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 00:04:00


I'm well aware of all the technicalities. SMTP is irrelevant because in this case the security of my wallet is dependant on the strongest aspect (AES encryption) rather than the weakest (sending it the clear over SMTP).


I'm not saying its more secure. I'm just saying its secure enough for me, and I would argue that it is almost as secure if not as secure as a traditional wallet software. 


The author of a bitcoin wallet software could do the same thing... Alter the code to their advantage and release an update. I use signed and downloaded javascript code, not the code directly on their website. If I turn off automatic updating and wait a few days before updating manually, it is not any less secure than a traditional wallet software in that sense.
@_date: 2013-11-16 22:27:55
Once you send coins the public key will be publicized, yes. But that isn't really a security issue as long as you generated your wallet using a cryptographically secure solution.


You're thinking of [BIP 0032]( And to answer your question, no, that wouldn't be useful for security purposes in this case. 
@_date: 2013-06-16 02:48:10
How would you transfer them to someone else without spoiling them? Surely just handing over the private key isn't secure.

Just a quick bug report: When I signed up, it said username already taken (which I doubted, since it was pretty unique). So I picked another and it worked. I realized a little later that the first account creation went through (since I saw two emails in my inbox), and so I ended up with two accounts under the same email, with separate usernames. They both work.
