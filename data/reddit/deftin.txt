The divisibility is currently 100million satoshis per bitcoin. The satoshi is the smallest unit at this time, but the network could be updated in the future to recognize smaller denominations. I suggest 1,000,000 Szabos per satoshi. 
In this way, even if there are only a few accessible bitcoins, it would still be enough for the community/world to transact.

Bitcoin had no on-chain fees at one point too. The fact is, when there's demand for a coin, there will be fees for on-chain transactions. The other coins have low fees because they aren't filling their blocks.

Market dominance is a broken metric. I could create a coin, premine it, sell a tiny fraction and immediately have a multi-billion dollar market cap. This is literally what most of the ICOs and altcoins are doing. Don't get scared. Bitcoin is still king and will be for the forseeable future.

The number and expertise of bitcoin devs outweighs other cryptos. Bitcoin has the greatest network effect, which is where much of its value is derived.  Other coins would need to surpass bitcoin on these fronts, which would be nearly impossible to do.

Some of us don't plan on selling. We philosophically believe in bitcoin. After hyperbitcoinization, we'll be able to spend bitcoin as cash. We don't need the immediate money and are content to wait for greater rewards. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:49:50
Are you serious? There are more pulls for bitcoin updates than any of the other cryptos. The thing about communication is that it doesn't work the same for bitcoin as it does for others because there is no central authority driving it. Just a lot of individuals, spending their time and effort trying to improve it, sometimes for no pay. There's no PR fund for bitcoin. If you want information you have to go find it.

That’s not how it works. A channel is essentially a record of balance between two parties. When the channel closes, the latest balance sheet is referenced and the balances are distributed between the two parties appropriately. This is a single transaction with 2 outputs, one for each party. So, the micro transactions don’t each get processed on the main chain, just the net effect of those micro transactions.

The exchange owns the private key where those coins are stored. The exchange can be hacked. If you hold your own private keys on a hardware wallet, they are much more secure.

95% of people don't follow the day to day news about the new tech coming to bitcoin, so you are overestimating how quickly that will effect price. Between 2014-2016 the price was largely stalled. Bear markets happen, but bitcoin has always rallied.

This is a hilarious re-imagining of history. Napster was a company using centralized storage for much of their data. Bitcoin is a protocol that is actually decentralized.

ICO's are crypto cancer. Almost nothing novel about 99% of them. Most of them only serve to enrich their founders' bitcoin positions at the expense of uninformed noobs. Any 'development' occurring there is of little purpose.  Ethereum has its own scaling issues and was hobbled a virtual pet game, not to mention having Vitalik as a single point of failure for a 80billion dollar project. I'm troubled that more people aren't troubled by these things.

Since anyone can launch a shitcoin, which will cut into all other coins' shares, this metric is a stupid way to look at it. Alts are garbage that may be momentarily useful, but the majority of their use cases can be usurped by changes to bitcoin in the future.

No, all addresses in your wallet are derived from the private key. So any bitcoin associated with any of those addresses would be tied to that private key.  Moving the bitcoin from one specific wallet would require making a transaction on the blockchain.

I'm not sure what you're implying. That Satoshi is the government? And that they released bitcoin to control the money supply?
I hate to burst your bubble, but even if some government agency had created bitcoin, the fact that it's open source means they cannot rein it in now. Maybe they own a large amount, but they would never move it until bitcoin is ubiquitous, and at that point, what difference does it make? They still cannot steal any bitcoin from anyone else. 
So kindly, sit down son. Real work is being done and you should watch.

The point of bitcoin is you don't need a 3rd party to transfer your payment. So you barter, directly using bitcoin. Why convert back to fiat?
Additionally, even if they can prove you once had bitcoin, they cannot prove that you still have it. Maybe you lost your private key.

We'll know if this is true if it ever gets any actual usage. Additionally, it's premined and doesn't seem to provide any incentive to maintain the network, so no, it won't take bitcoin's place.

So the theory is that hodling will lead to increased price (as it reduces the on-hand supply), which leads to increased media attention, which leads to increased awareness and adoption, which reinforces to the hodlers that their actions are correct. Repeat the cycle.

Personal anecdote: I was around back in early 2013 and saw it go from 30 to 1200, back down to a few hundred dollars pretty quickly. I guess you could say I lost interest or "faith" in it for a little while. I only started looking into it again a year ago.

Transaction fee too low. 50/bit won't do it. You should be up around 200-250 per bit. Most wallets should do this on their own, but if you're setting it manually this is likely the reason. You might have to wait out the 72 hours then try again.

Personally that would be fine with me, but it would be up to consensus as to whether it were successful.

@_date: 2017-03-23 15:13:23
I agree with you that miners who disregard the underlying principles of bitcoin will kill any altcoin they HF off of bitcoin. If there is inflation, then there's no point of using the coin as a speculative investment and what they have essentially created is a more-difficult-to-use version of cash.
But there does need to be a somewhat reasonable incentive to mine bitcoins. While we've entered a funky stage where mining in many countries is not reasonable and much of the mining has centralized in China, I see a scenario in which large businesses invest in bitcoin and then set up their own mining and node centers in order to protect their investment and the strength of the network.

Yes, it would essentially split Bitcoin into two coins, hypothetically referred to as BTC and BTU.  If you originally had 5 bitcoins you would now have 5BTC and 5BTU.  There would initially be a danger when performing a transaction, as it could cause you to send both types of coins instead of just the one you are trying to trade. 
The values of the new coins would likely differ, but the combined value would probably drop well below current value for a while. Current projections show BTC maintaining more value than BTU.

Essentially a large group of miners want to make the rules so that they control bitcoin moving forward. Their plan is to fork bitcoin, then attack the old bitcoin in the hopes that people jump ship to whatever abomination they create. 
BitcoinUnlimited's code is shit though and the introduction of Emergent Consensus creates an unpredictable environment that most people who value bitcoin would not want to invest in.

@_date: 2017-03-23 13:57:45
Do these people(miners) fail to take into account that a fixed supply and increasing demand increases the value of the currency and therefore the block reward and fees' value? There's no reason that the fees collected couldn't adequately compensate miners in the future so long as bitcoin's value continues to increase.

I feel like the block size increase, while it would affect storage space on nodes, isn't the primary concern with BU. Even if the block size increases to its theoretical limit of 256MB, Bitcoin still doesn't scale to the level of Visa's tps. This shows that BU's assertion that this is needed for easy transactions is disingenuous if they have bothered to consider the long-term.
The emergent consensus is the really dangerous part as it fundamentally shifts the power and decision-making toward the miners, disrupting bitcoin's underlying principals and threatening the balance of the system, weakening user confidence and ultimately the value of bitcoin.

Bitcoin's code can be changed, but it requires a large plurality of those running the software to agree on a change (that is, update to a version that includes the change.) A single user could change the code and attempt to run it, however if the rest of the network does not recognize it, then it will have no real effect. 
The developers you mention are volunteers who work together to craft improvements to the bitcoin code. One suggested improvement is Segregated Witness. The more recent versions of Bitcoin Core software include this improvement and anyone who has installed it is signalling that they want to move forward with that update. 
Another group called Bitcoin Unlimited has their own group of developers who have other ideas about improving bitcoin. 
Neither proposal has the support needed to move forward with the new code currently.

Always transfer your coins off of an exchange when you are done purchasing/selling. I purchased off of Mt Gox a few months before shit hit the fan and remember hearing stories of people who used their Mt Gox wallet as their wallet. Sure, it's easier than setting up your own, but you are placing a lot of trust in a 3rd party that you have never actually met with a currency that can't be confiscated, even by the good guys. 
I purchased a KeepKey recently and I couldn't be more glad I did. I've heard Trezore is pretty good too. It essentially allows you to keep your coins in a wallet that is completely offline as soon as you unplug the device. Your wallet is therefore much harder to compromise.

If your hands are weak, you should not get involved in crypto. Look at it this way. If you had gotten your coins immediately, they still would be worth less now. Would you have sold at a loss?

Governments who issue their own currencies never fail to inflate that currency. So anyone holding it has less and less purchasing power over time. We've come to just accept that as how money works and governments happily use this "feature" to pay off their debts. 
Bitcoin has a capped supply. Holding bitcoin does not innately cause you to lose purchasing power over time. A government cannot raid your bitcoin like they can your bank account. Bitcoin provides a currency/value store with properties that have not been seen in modern economic systems before. Governments, if forced by the will of their people, who operate in bitcoin exclusively would lose the ability to wage unnecessary wars and rack up debt on silly projects.

The thing is, at any time when the price was 16k, it could have gone up or it could have gone down. It's easy to say in retrospect what someone should have done, but in the moment you just don't have the information.  When you look at long-term trends, they are upward, so the safer way to invest is to buy and hold (averaging in) and wait until it's either enough value to purchase life-changing things or until it's a unit of account. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:15:25
If you have an amount of bitcoin that it would be very bad to lose, you should move it to a private wallet. Preferably a hard wallet like trezor or ledger. When you keep your coins on an exchange or a wallet website, you essentially have an IOU from them, not actual coins. If something happens like the exchange gets shut down or a rogue employee somehow manages to steal the coins and run, you will never see those coins. 
Examples: Mt. Gox, BTC-e
People will say "Oh but the exchanges are much better regulated than they were back then," but you're still taking a risk. If you're planning on sitting on those coins for a while, get them off the exchange.

The concern with BCH is that it is largely controlled by the miners. Even the developers are working for the miners there. So there's nothing from stopping them from implementing increased block rewards for themselves or increasing block size to the point that only a few datacenters hold the blockchain. These datacenters would be easy targets for a government looking to crack down on crypto. In short, centralization weakens BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:04:50
It will resemble an asset for a while. During the adoption phase, value will increase so people will not want to spend it. That's just basic economics. Once it is widely adopted and the price variation becomes small, more people will start to spend. By that point, tools will be in place to allow for micro-transactions and just about every business will accept bitcoin because it will be proven as valuable. There's a logical path of progression here and many people fail to see that.
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:47:19

When a fork happens, if you have Y amount BTC, you now also have Y amount B2X. Many people will likely try to trade their B2X for more BTC. Because the B2X programmer(s) did not implement replay protection, trying to send B2X coins may cause you to accidentally also send BTC coins, risking your money. Trezor implies that they haven't ironed out a safe way to do this immediately after the fork, but to stay tuned for further announcements.

I like Trezor. I think they have a new version coming out shortly, but the original is very easy to use. The hardware wallet holds the private keys so they are not exposed to the network and are safe. When you set up the hardware wallet, it will ask you to copy down a series of random words. Do this very carefully. These words can be used to recover your private keys if your hardware wallet gets lost or damaged. Store the words in a safe place and don't tell anyone unless you trust them completely.

When you buy from an exchange, the coins don't actually move until you withdraw them and send them to your private wallet that is separate from the exchange. You are essentially purchasing the right to move the coins at a later time.

It's wrong to assume that for one person to benefit, another must lose. This way of thinking is how progressives push heavy taxes and creep ever further into private finances. 
The fact is, if you buy bitcoin, and the value goes up because of increased demand, and you then sell bitcoin, both parties are benefitting. At that moment, the best interest of each party was the exchange. Based on the information that both parties had, they agreed to that. The price may dip, but that still does not mean the person holding bitcoin lost anything. It's only a loss if he sells at a lower price. 
Ultimately, hodlers only realize their position when they exchange bitcoin for some other good or currency. So hodling in itself is not necessarily a winning or losing venture.

Lightning network and sidechains. Essentially, multiple transactions processed outside of the main bitcoin blockchain that eventually are all settled to the main blockchain in a single transaction. 
For example, if parties A, B, C, D are always exchanging money, each exchange on the blockchain carries a cost. If they track how much each owes one another and then tally up the balances at the end of the month and settle, it reduces the costs. This is theoretically how lightning network will function.

1. An emergency PoW fork to make BTC immune to miner chain-jumping is probably preferable to letting bitcoin die. 
2. You can't prove the motivations of all miners, but you have to imagine that some would stay on the BTC chain out of principle regardless of profitability. (Slushpool situation supports this theory as their BTC-specific hashrate has grown significantly lately.) A painfully slow network is a possibility, but the difficulty would eventually adjust.
3. Most people see the team behind BCH as a bunch of hucksters and frauds and would rather chop off their arm than get into business with them. 
Obviously no proofs, but there can't be. We don't have perfect information. This is all game theory.

Because the development of BCH is largely sponsored by Bitmain and other mining corps. Inflation only hurts those at the bottom of the economy. The first people who get the currency get to spend it when it's most valuable. 
Look at how the Fed does it. They print money and give it to the banks who can spend it before the inflation is realized by the economy. By the time the money gets to the little guy, the inflation is realized and it's worth less. So any Cryptocurrency that is open to increasing rewards will introduce the same issues we see in our current state economies.

Probably not. The reason taxes work now is that if you don't pay them, you'll be thrown in prison and your bank account garnered. When the government can't access anyone's funds, it takes away a big part of the threat. 
They could lock up a significant part of the population, but how would they pay for it?
I suppose they could raise point of sale taxes for companies, but this would probably just encourage more black market trades. 
Ultimately an advanced, more anonymized bitcoin would handicap the government's ability to carry out massive government programs. In my opinion, that's a good thing.

Any currency that is issued and is not backed by something of value. Essentially all government currencies, as they carry value that is based solely on the understanding that others accept it has value too. Of course, Bitcoin could technically be called fiat using this definition, but Bitcoin has a scheduled supply that will eventually cap at 21million. Governments never stop supplying and inflating their currencies. Bitcoin also has a level of security that some would consider a value. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:46:37
No. The mining and processing of transactions is based on hashing difficulty, not number of transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:53:11
An amount of miners will leave in a way that will likely maximize profits for the miners. We can guess that the market equilibrium here is around 15% based on futures estimates. Even at double that, assuming some miners actually believe in B2X, that's 30% of hash rate on the B2X chain and 70% remaining on BTC. As time goes on though, and miners realize that the coup doesn't have the traction they want, some start to defect back to BTC since it's underserved by hash and more profitable. Hash rate will trend toward the profitability equilibrium. 
The people pushing B2X rely on high transaction volume to be profitable. Hodlers and those that believe in the bitcoin technology as a politically and financially disruptive tool can survive much longer without making transactions. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 21:09:33

Making changes in bitcoin protocol is supposed to be incredibly difficult. This adds security. Additionally, if 95% of people agree with an action, more people are likely to have reviewed the new code, used it on a testnet, etc.  I know it seems like a hindrance here, but it's a good feature. 
Also, with Litecoin's consensus level of 75%, this means that they can approve and test new features more easily and once proven effective, that could help bitcoin reach its higher standard of approval.

There will likely still be depressions under a deflationary system, however the boom and bust cycles are a direct result of the poor inflationary policies of our governments. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 15:49:33
That is doesn't increase the supply though, it just makes it more divisible. Inflation is a different beast because the added supply is not evenly distributed among those in the economy, so there are people it benefits more than others. Moving the decimal point evenly affects everyone who holds bitcoin. 
And yes, you can do sub-satoshi transactions. It would be applied to frequent, regularly occurring payments and based on probability. For instance, a music service where you pay .1 satoshis per minute or something like that. Every minute a RNG would run over a 1/10 probability. If it hits 1, you pay a satoshi, if it doesn't you wouldn't pay anything. Over time, it would average to .1 satoshi/min.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:45:08
I don't think you can break a satoshi, but when using very small amounts very often, a probability can be assigned to transactions, so that 1 in 1000 uses pays a satoshi, so the effective payment is 1/1000th per use.

There will certainly be periods where bull runs and new platforms cause transaction spikes. While these spikes can be painful to users, it definitely is a motivator for everyone to use the tools at their disposal to streamline their processes. That motivator is completely removed if the block limit is removed.

Many people here (and especially those who have been around a while) see bitcoin as more than a stock type asset to sell for a profit after a while. We see it as a possible world-changing technology where we never sell it, but it becomes valuable enough to purchase things directly at a later date. We also revere its anti-fragility and ability to undermine establishment power structures. It's hard to do that when you're still playing on their field (fiat).

I think there will likely be "fork-fatigue" (I'm coining that phrase) in the near future.

BTC should not need to raise block size for a little while. Once schnorr sigs, MAST, LN, bulletproofs, etc are live and we've exhausted other efficiency methods, block size can be revisited.  Keeping it low forces users to be good stewards of their transaction methods. Just look at how coinbase is finally coming around on segwit and batching.  If we had just raised the block size, they would not be incentivised to make those kind of changes and the blockchain bloat would accelerate.

I'm not sure that ethereum can offer the same level of security that bitcoin does though. Not so long ago, under the direction of Vitalik (a single person should not have this power over a crypto) the blockchain was rolled back to fix an exploit.

I think you are missing my point. Bitcoin was supported initially by those that disagree with the current financial landscape, i.e. anarcho-capitalists and libertarians. Inflation is a hidden tax against people who hold a currency. Tax is theft. Therefore inflation is theft and inherently wrong. Bitcoin has a set creation schedule. The fact that it is know allows everyone to plan their decisions around the currency, from the individual citizen to the upper echelons of government. (But the real benefit here is to the citizen.) Reintroducing inflation weakens the position of the little guy.

The fact is nobody can tell you what will happen. The last fork caused a price explosion after the uncertainty had passed.

Exactly. The false argument that is always given by Keynesians is that people will never spend any money if it's deflationary. They literally think people will not buy food and gasoline and necessary goods. Even luxury items need to be replaced.

I think if you haven't held the bitcoin for a full year, then you're going to take a pretty sizable hit on the taxes. If you've held for more than a year, it's comparable to capital gains tax. But the main concept you lay out is correct. Cash out enough to cover your initial investment and the taxes on it, keep the rest safe or gamble it on the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:24:24
As someone who's been here almost 5 years, I agree with you completely. It is important for bitcoin to show that it is a store of value (and a more stable one at that) before it can be used for small daily purchases. 
That said, when it does stabilize and the 2nd layer scaling solutions mature, I think that will lessen the friction and allow it to evolve into a more cash-like system.  That stability will require a higher valuation on the markets and a greater percentage of the population on-board. BitcoinCash makes the mistake of trying to put the cart before the horse.

If the amount of available bitcoin were evenly divided among the population of the planet, each person would get .002 bitcoins. That's $10.40 USD.  So $500 would get you almost 50x that.

So, it's important to recognize the difference between public addresses and private keys. Each private key can be used to create many public addresses. The dividend of a transaction will return to an address derived from the same private key. If you're sending from an exchange, you don't have to worry about any of that, they'll handle it in the background. 
If you are using a wallet where you control the private key, it should also automatically set the change address to one you control.

Money is not created in a fork. Pre-fork tokens just exist on both forks. The sum of their value immediately post-fork is the value of the original chain pre-fork. Any price change in either of the forks is the result of increased or decreased confidence based on the specifics of each fork. For instance, after the BCH fork, confidence in the original Bitcoin chain swelled and the price followed. It may have seemed like money/value was created by the fork, but that's not how it works.

Look up Mt Gox. If it's on an exchange, it's an IOU and in times of security failure, you're fucked. Hardware wallets can be restored with a passphrase, so losing it or destroying it doesn't destroy your coins. You need to do some more research here and think adversarily. The point of bitcoin is that you don't have to trust a 3rd party to ensure your funds.

There won't be a 'donation' address. Most wallets have the ability to create multiple public addresses that you can use to receive bitcoin. Using those and changing every once in a while is a good idea. Don't use a web wallet or an exchange. They are subject to hackers and less secure than holding your own. Ideally, you'd want to get a Trezor or other hardware wallet to maximize your security.

You misunderstand the nature of deflationary currencies. Should bitcoin be adopted ubiquitously, "buying in" at any point would never forfeit value. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:38:20
The release of the new bitcoins is coded into the software that miners and nodes run. When a miner solves a block and the nodes all agree, they are agreeing to create the 12.5BTC in the ownership of that miner. If someone ran customized software and tried to solve a block or give themselves extra BTC, it would be rejected by nodes on the network. So, you can't just create bitcoins and give them to yourself. Everyone on the network has to agree on the creation and transmission of bitcoins for them to be valid.

@_date: 2017-05-09 15:52:25
One advantage to Bitcoin is that the supply is known. Governments endlessly print their currencies. This is essentially a method of theft they use because when the money is first spent by the government after it is printed, its value is higher. As the supply disperses into the economy, it weakens the purchasing power of the other dollars, pounds, whatever. This hurts the common citizen. Saving money under your mattress means you lose money every year.
Bitcoin's supply on the other hand increases by 12.5BTC per 10 minutes currently, and halves ever few years, eventually ending at 21 million total bitcoins.  It is more divisible than government issued currencies, so that's not an issue. It also is naturally deflationary, which allows it to function as an effective store of value (assuming wide adoption.)
For people that hate how government handles money, Bitcoin is brilliant.

Think of it this way. If someone else has the hardware and could mine with it and make a profit, why do they need your money?
The answer is because they are skimming off the rewards that you make with your purchased hashrate. They are minimizing their risk and maximizing their profits while allowing you to absorb risk.

There will be some that continue to hold. There will be some that choose to cash out when the price is right for them. Everyone functions differently based on their perceived best interests. If you're 70 and you want a nice car, you aren't going to wait 10 years for your bitcoin to be worth more. Lots of other similar market situations can occur. 


Currently, I don't know that there is a ton of incentive. Others who offer that would have to chime in on their reasons. As fiat's inflation continues, people will be more likely to store in bitcoin and avoid fiat and cards altogether. So there will be a point when there is more incentive.

It would be more likely that initially the value of both coins together would equal the initial value of the bitcoin.

A new proof of work is one level of contention. Targeting individuals, no matter how terrible you perceive them to be, by wiping their addresses is a whole other clusterfuck and would kill the new chain before it started. No one is supposed to have that kind of power. That's the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:45:26
Bitcoin is functioning as a store of value rather than a currency as of right now. While not the original purpose, there is nothing wrong with that. It actually buys the network time to scale.  Eventually, as the value increases, this will pressure more people to spend bitcoin, as that is the only way they can actually recognize their gains. So it will transition into more of a currency over the next decade or two, in my estimation.

Yes, mining will be incentivized solely by tx fees. The plan is for BTC to be so valuable at that point that even a small fee will be well worth the effort. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 19:33:35
Totally agree. Telling people to buy bitcoin isn't a good strategy. They will buy and then panic sell 99% of the time. Instead, educating them on the purpose and function of bitcoin might drive some people to purchase it, and they will me much more likely to ride out the volatile fluctuations.

You'll hate yourself when they reach 500. BTC  isn't a get rich quick scheme. I put some money into them and consider that money gone. I now have bitcoins and will only cash out/start spending when I can retire on them. Might not happen, but I'll have no regrets.

The fact is, "Not your keys, not your coins". A lot of people got screwed by Mt Gox back in the day. Mt Gox seemingly exited by absconding with a lot of peoples bitcoin. No one could withdraw from the exchange. It was bad. So in the future, get a hardware wallet and be sure to transfer any purchases to it for safe keeping.

If enough miners/hashrate is running BIP148, the possibility of the legacy chain getting re-orged into the BIP148 chain grows. This is an economic incentive to mine the BIP148 chain so that you are not wasting your energy and resources. There would be an avalanche effect and eventually everyone would run on BIP148. 
This is tough though because it's estimated that 20% of the hashrate would be needed to get the ball rolling.

As value of bitcoin increases, mining becomes more attractive and people who may have stopped will return. Also, some people will mine just to add strength to the network, even if they are just breaking even.  So, the only reason I see for mining to collapse would be if everyone woke up tomorrow and decided bitcoin was not worth anything. I don't see that as likely, since it is a service(non-obstructed fund transfer) as well as a currency, which gives it inherent value.
@_date: 2018-12-14 19:31:22
That's just irresponsible. Bitcoin is a finite asset. It's not dollars that the FDIC can make you whole on. If you lose the bitcoin, you're boned, so you better be practicing very high level opsec.

Also, wouldn't reverting back to the current bitcoin protocol essentially be splitting the chain? So they'd have a new chain that no one would recognize and the segwit chain would continue chugging along.

No. The difficulty is set every ~2 weeks based on the total network hash rate. The block reward is currently 12.5BTC per block. It will halve to 6.25BTC/block in 2020 I believe, and continue halving ever 4 years or so until 2140.  The block reward will not change dynamically otherwise.

I'm pretty sure one of my parents could build a road by themselves if they really wanted to. The fact of the matter is that when the need for a service/item outweighs the cost, then things get done regardless of what parties are involved because the creation of that service, even temporarily, provides a net benefit to all concerned parties at a cost that any given party is willing (Voluntarily) to pay. Government has broken this principle of economics.

The way I tend to see it is the government takes $10 in taxes. It spends 3 dollars on its employees. Another 2 dollars on over-paying for goods and services and then distributes 5 out to some industry/people/whatever. $5 dollars is effectively destroyed and another is allocated in a way contrary to market pressures.

Your claim is completely flawed. MtGox as a company can have requests lobbied against it by its users. Users requesting that 1000 transactions of .001 BTC at a single pricepoint be instead a single transaction of 1 BTC are not asking for some ridiculous government control, nor are their requests conflicting with libertarian/anarcho-capitalist fundamentals. MtGox ultimately gets to choose what policies to implement and that will either help or hurt their customer base. There is nothing wrong with suggestions that will streamline the exchange process.

The problem I have with this is that the government did not pay for our education and roads. Our parents and grandparents did. Government does not really create value or contribute to the economy, they siphon off of it. 
The govt has overspent on taxes they have collected by 16 trillion dollars and you are advocating that we voluntarily give them more because it will give us the warm n fuzzies inside? That's lunacy. 
Bitcoin's entire purpose is to undermine the government and its participation is Keynesian economic theory.

You won't make your money back in any short time. The fractions of bitcoins you may mine will only cover the costs if price increases dramatically. I've had my jala running for 1 month and have earned about .2 BTC. In that time, difficulty has increased more than two-fold. I may make 1 BTC if I keep it running for two years but that's being optimistic. You'd be better off purchasing BTC straight up.
