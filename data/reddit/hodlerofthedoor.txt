If Elon uses my future moon deed as toilet paper I'd be honored. He poops gold. He'll probably even give me a free ride to the moon if I let SolarCity lease some of my land for solar panels.

She can buy 6.59 iPhones right now. She's ecstatic about that. While we wait for my art career to really take off her short term plan is to HODL. I think that's a great idea.

You'd be surprised at the amount of people who buy into something someone else declares valuable simply by printing something on a fancy piece of paper.

"The UN Outer Space Treaty of 1967 stipulates that no government can own extraterrestrial property. However, it neglects to mention individuals and corporations. Therefore, under laws dating back to early US settlers, it is possible to stake a claim for land that has been surveyed by registering with the US Office of Claim Registries." &lt;----Don't worry there is plenty of space, you can stay in my guesthouse. Apparently it is a good time to buy land now, my real estate broker says they aren't making more of it, especially on the moon.

Hmm....well really its up to her but my real estate broker tells me at the spot price of BTC right now I can purchase 220.67 acres on the moon. 
I prefer to wait a little bit longer until Elon Musk's Tesla Model 12 can fly me there. Give or take 2-3 years?

If you zoom in enough you'll see that those "insects" are actually children, left to right ages 5 and 4 (this one is adopted), and a baby that is 8 months old and crawling. Sometimes the finer details of my drawings are lost on the non art crowd.

Okay so the moon isn't for you (more real estate for us). If you want to stay on Earth 1 BTC is worth approx $6600 now which with some decent leverage you could have purchasing power of approx $33,000. 
That is enough to buy 20 acres of rural land right now. Each acre can fit about 242 parking spaces on it, so mgbyrnc can fit 4,840 of his lambo's on that.
