Don't make this about evolution. This is about the absolutely asinine statement you used in an attempt to support your position.
The reasoning you're attempting to use goes something like this: "Science tells me that HIV can lead to AIDS, but i've never seen nor experienced it, so i don't think it's actually true." It sounds ridiculous because it is.

Defeats the purpose of mint; the value is whatever you input, and wont change with the market.

I'd think it's more likely that they're mining CPU coins like QRK and SRC.  Mining those with a botnet would have the greatest return, as all your computers are on 'equal footing' with everyone else in the network.

What you're suggesting was essentially done years ago before bluetooth was big. All the best phones/mobile tech had IR tx/rx on them, allowing  devices to pair with each other and send data. 
The primary issue is the pulse time of the LEDs. From what i can find, most phone LEDs have a minimum pulse time of 60ms+. That's just not fast enough to do anything with.

Why is LTC unsustainable? People are saying the same thing about BTC. 
Regarding quark - that's just a scam. It was premined all to hell, and all anyone wants to do is argue semantics over the definition of 'premine.'

Tell that to entropy!
But you're correct, *could* be never.

Because everything else in the supply chain is fixed US dollar price. The only people to price fully in BTC have margins so large that 25%+ fluctuations don't really matter.

Stupid question;
If the prices fluctuate by less than the amount of time it takes to transfer BTC, how is anyone able to take advantage of the price difference?
