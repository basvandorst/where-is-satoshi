Stock sites don't even send you certificates you tend to pay a huge administration fee if you want it on paper......

It says they will pay bonus to those with btc in partner wallet. I don't see much info though, there is a few options but is it worth transferring since the high fee/time? Anyone used hitbtc, verification looks difficult and don't want money to be stuck forever..

Okay, this is useful information. Who adjusts the difficulty, or the program itself maintains this? Since there is no "head of bitcoin" how is the difficulty set?
With regards to solving the blocks. Can one decide which transactions to process individually. Ie. I could 'mine' my own block with my stuck transaction?

Maybe she's just playing the altcoin market and you're a bit slow?

It's very easy to trade bitcoin. Daytrading however... I would never do it. I don't think it's any different to gambling.

This is highly worrying that they don't have enough money.......

So for me I used coinbase but then found out about GDAX. So I use that now. If you post limits then you don't pay any fee to sell btc. If you want to remove money from platform a SEPA is €0.15 it says and ACH is free, or US wire is more but fixed rather than % based.
As I'm in the UK and our banks are not happy about SEPA payments I got a revolut bank account and that does free currency conversion from gbp/usd/eur whatever for free so now I use that bank account for all bitcoin related stuff because it sends SEPA for free where as UK banks charge between £9 and £25 per transaction!

I try to tell my family that they should just put £100 in. They don't trust it or understand even when I explain. They want to have it where they can hold it (in a BANK). Yeah right as though you can quickly withdraw from those savings accounts, as though you know HOW the bank actually generates money to pay you your 0.1% interest per year.

Why? What if the bitcoin are just sitting there, and did not sell them for ££££?
If bitcoin isnt' regulated, then are they even allowed to tax them (the btc itself)?
