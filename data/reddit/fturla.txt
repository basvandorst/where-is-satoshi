My nephew bought bitcoin when it was at 40 dollars a coin. He sold most of his holdings when it went past 200 dollars per coin. Did you think he imagined it would pass $1,000? Now it is over $10,000 a second time. If the blockchain network can handle higher transaction volume with lower fees per transaction then the value of the could have a chance to get over a million dollars a coin.
 Remember for the first three years of bitcoins life the value was less than 10 cents a coin then it jumped to around ten dollars in 2012. In 2013, it reached $200 but dropped to 100. In 2014, it rose to 800 dollars but it stayed between 250 to 400 for two years until 2016. In 2016 the price went from 400 to over $1000. In 2017, Bitcoin basically went straight up from $1,000 to almost $20,000. In 2018, the price dropped to as low as $2300 and is mainly in the $4,000 range. In 2019, the price went from around $4,000 to over $13,000 just last week. The current price of BTC is now $11,000 give or take a few hundred dollars as of 06-30-2019 at 6 pm pacific standard time. 
If you think the trend is your friend, then it is likely that within 5 years the value of only one bitcoin will be worth over one million dollars.

Always prepare yourself to learn about cryptocurrency specifically bitcoin first then realize how to store it (wallet), buy and sell it (fiat currency or altcoins), and transfer it (blockchain).
Personally, I can purchase it from Coinbase, Cash App, and Robinhood App but you need to know and accept the transfer fees and additional costs with each type of transaction. 
I also mine indirectly other cryptocurrencies and acquire additional BTC. At present, I believe I can get at least 5% of bitcoin every year so if the value of one coin goes to one million dollars, I would be earning at least 50,000 dollars a year just by mining 0.05 BTC. I could mine a lot more but mining is a small hobby.
If you can't acquire BTC directly from the blockchain or mining pools and you won't mine other cryptocurrencies, see if you can get someone to buy the coin for you directly from an exchange and then send you the amount while you pay them a fee that is less than the fees many companies charge you for buying the coins. The ATM bitcoin exchanges charge at least a 30% fee while many public exchanges don't tell you their market sell rates until you complete a sale then you can figure out what fees they charged. 
Most bitcoin users rarely sell much coin because the appreciation rate is better than most other assets. If they do, the sale price is often at least 10 percent above the market rate.
Am I willing to sell some BTC? Yes, I sell usually to buy other cryptocurrencies I am looking to hold long term as a gamble.
I am guessing you are paying over ten dollars to buy 80,000 satoshis which currently is valued at about $8.75. In essence, you are paying over 2 dollars or over 25% in transaction fees. That is too much. It's cheaper to pay someone to buy the coin on an exchange and send you the amount into your wallet such as at Blockchain.com.
Good Luck.

I agree in that most of the people against cryptocurrency don't know that the characteristics of bitcoin and all the other coins are very different than other types of assets. You can't make fake bitcoin, you can't give it to someone that doesn't know how to own it, you own and buy bitcoin because you believe that it is worth more  than the fiat currency you just gave to get some. Bitcoin survives because people are willing to use it as an exchange medium than the fiat currency they normally use. And the biggest aspect of bitcoin that most people don't get is that if the currency is used and traded with a consistent level of activity, the price will most likely go up forever because of the likelihood that the supply will almost always decline over time.

I would love for most people to panic and attempt to sell all their crypto-currency  because the exchanges will either adapt or die and the peer to peer trading will eventually happen and my buy orders at much lower levels will get filled. 
Not going to lie but as long as bitcoin and all the other currencies are hard to use and trade, the average person will never ever be able to use it and the demand is unrealistically too high given the difficulty to use when governments don't want you to have it at all.
Bitcoin gives people an opportunity to have a chance to get off the grid without people knowing about your life and that's a relief many people want because the control aspect of society is getting too much especially when the rules seem obviously too arbitrary determined by the most powerful and not by merit.

The current coinbase minimum fees without the interest or transaction fee is $1.49 for less than $25 bitcoin purchase and I think for every $25 level the  fee goes up $1.50 therefore you will always be paying over 6.5% of your capital every time you buy. I think something is wrong here?
