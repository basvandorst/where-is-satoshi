It's called simplecryptolife, it's not live yet. Just wanted to test the waters.

My question is why can you only trade in BTC, ETH, &amp; Monero. Those are the only coins available to trade with on exchanges. Why is this?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:27:24
objective af. It's a place to discuss and learn about the technology and speculate on coins &amp; ICO's

Nobody knows mate, most people predicted a bit dip @ every 1k interval, but it blew past all those. We could be seeing a huge bull trend till 50K, the truth is, nobody knows!
Use your intuition and knowledge to make a prediction.

Same. Papa bless. I don't care if im up with cryptocurrency, and it all fails and im left with nothing but a loss. I'd rather chance and have a good chunk of my investments in crypto. As i believe in the technology and zero confidence in fiat &amp; the government.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:14:53
i recommend CoinSquare
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:51:30
Well it's the one you need in order to get the alt coins. And it's the "Brand name for crypto" lots of reasons why it's unique and valued imo

Exactly, imagine going all in, and the next day it plummets. Thats a risk i personally, am not willing to take. But indeed i can go the opposite way to and you could potentially double your profits within a couple days.

Stellar is doing quite Stellar rn. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:14:37
They don't trade in Canada tho
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:44:15
And what is the main goal by doing this?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:01:30
Ok fill me in on the lingo, what does HODL &amp; FOMO mean.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:28:14
There's nothing wrong with storing your value with one type of currency. Do you spend precious metals like you do fiat? No, different purpose, until they figure out the scale-ability issue.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:21:14
It's not me, it's the system. Spending bitcoin isn't even possible. If it were as easy i would. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:25:54
Hopefully when that time comes we all realize just how shitty fiat/centralized currency is and just use this ecosystem from now on!
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:05:18
This is why i don't think it'll crash. The majority of investors get exited about the thought of if going down to anything less than it is now!
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:22:02
Ok let me make this simple. Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark Bark.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:17:11
like 1bitcoin? lol if he meant anything elsethats just pathetic bahaha
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:48:46
aah yes thanks haha
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:35:47
Ok guys when an exchange says this "You are trading at a price of: 0.00007688 BTC = 1 CAD" How do i convert that to show what the exchange is trading at?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:31:23
coinsquare also :(
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:34:43
ur a good person who ever you are!
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:29:41
Has anyone heard of nTrust? i want to make sure im not entering a scam.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:51:41
It's best used as a store of value. Right now using it in the same manner as lets say visa, it's just not feasible due to the slow transaction times, and high fees. Stop assuming stuff mate. Im not tyring to get rich quick. I'm investing long term into an idea that i agree strongly with(de-centralized ways of doing things.)

Whats the "m" in mBTC mean?
