I'm interested. How user friendly do you think this process can be made to be? Is it going to be suitable for every day non-techies?
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:43:06
Every time there is a pullback these jokers pop up. Most of them (that don't create a new reddit account like this one) are obviously gold holders. They have been sitting on their stash for years and it's made nothing while if they had been in Bitcoin they would have made a fortune. They believe it's too late to jump now so have become bitter trolls. Throw them a tip. :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:21:12
Yea. Fuck Blockfolio
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:56:40
Yes. And that was 8 years ago and where are we now? It's taking too long.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:02:14
In some way's it's a relief. Towards the end of 2017 the whole market felt like a boil about to pop. A 50% pullback is probably healthy. And maybe the influx on people buying on credit cards and remortgaging will stop (at least for now). It all felt too crazy and needed to cool down. I don't like the losses but in context (of buying in around Sept.) they are not bad at all.

I suspect your going to have a lot of new 'Internet friends' before this finishing syncing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:37:09
But he is the 'Bitcoin Jesus' so obviously he knew the future price and was rightly pissed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:42:42
It will be 50% off soon. BOGOF!
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:39:07
Unbelievable. His advice is to hold your Bitcoin on an exchange so you can sell it for BCash. You would have thought he might have learnt from his part in the MtGox debacle.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:27:55
I was just about to post. I am sending some BTC to Coinbase. I used a LEDGER NANO and set the fees to HIGH. 6 hours later not a single confirmation.
A while ago there was a strange blip in the Mempool chart where it seemed to go to zero for a while. 
Did someone turn Bitcoin off? :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:23:45
Maybe we should give thanks to Roger for his 'project'.
Bitcoin needs to be tested. It's almost a decade now and let's be honest. We have not come far enough. The slightly whiffy breeze that is Bcash will be nothing to the storms that approach as Bitcoin grows. What happens when Bitcoin get's to $50k? $100k? $500k. They will come from all directions and by then we will need to be strong from root to branch. 
Right now we have a cut and paste fork with a bigger block size and a rotated Bitcoin logo. Tomorrow will bring much worse and lessons need to be learnt and work needs to be done. Hopefully this will galvanise both the community and developers. These are growing pains, nothing more. But we do need to grow and adapt. 
Thanks Roger.

A promise is a promise. You should have done your sums before you opened your mouth.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:23:51
When you say 'lost' what do you mean? I presumed they would always be returned.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:29:43
lol. Just like the old days. If that happens you can keep your pizza. I'm loading up on $5 Bitcoins. I always regretted not getting in early enough so a second chance would be nice. Unfortunatly I'm betting it won't go much below $10k at the lowest. Unless Tether collapses and then maybe another $2 or $3k.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:41:44
People are going to feel scammed by this. RV has seriously lost the plot. He probably feels he is in an unregulated space and is rich enough to do what he wants until he gets his own way. Hopefully one day he will be held to account.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:42:48
It's a dip. Not even a big one by BTC standards. Please refer to the historical charts and take the tin-foil hat off.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:19:24
Usefull. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:02:46
I'm thinking it may drop as far as $11k. Maybe more if BCash has another pump which looks possible.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:44:29
Thanks for the reply. Is this on a roadmap anywhere? If so where is it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:58
Don't give Roger Ver too much credit. This correction is overdue. He probably made it a bit worse. That's all.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:00:29
For those with small ammounts of crypto a hardware wallet may be too expensive. Paper wallets can be just as secure but make sure you take some time to do it properly (offline in a secure browser mode). Worth taking time to read up on before you start.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:52:55
The moon... Seriously, are you aware how fast Bitcoin has risen lately? It's overdue a decent pull back and it's a healthy thing long term.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:33:46
How were you to know. This BItcoin rise has been unique and may not be repeated. You came out ahead so feel good. Who knows, in a couple of years there could be some major event and Bitcoin is worthless again. I hope not but anything is possible.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:00:07
Don't give him any more please. Too much money can mess people up.
@_date: 2017-12-12 10:35:14
It has a psychological benefit. That's all.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:51:02
Street Triples are awesome. They do everything (apart from keeping the wind off). Much better than the psychotic and totaly road-unsuitable R1 I just got rid of.
Well done. Much more fun than a Lambo any day. And you don't look such a tit riding one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:22:29
They will be adding Bitcoin Gold next. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:47:46
I met an old guy in a betting shop on the East coast of England once. He was drunk and smelt of piss and kept telling anyone who would listen that he invented 'TIT COIN' and was a millionaire. He obviously didn't have any money and no one took any notice. This was in 2015. Looking back I wonder if he with saying 'BIT COIN' but his speech was bad because he had no teeth.
Maybe nothing. Just thought I would share...
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:15:48


And the moral of this story is don't listen to your wife.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:17:38
Couldn't have happened to a nicer guy. If we had more people like Andreas speaking up for the Crypto world the petty divisions and in fighting might not be as bad and the future would be much more secure (or at least the ride might be less rocky).
It's good Karma that RV's insults and rants indirectly made this happen.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:36:40
It is depressing to see the value go down but actualy I feel relieved also. It's like having a big boil on your face that keeps getting bigger. The relief when you finaly pop it is nice...
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:06:57
Me for the last few weeks... At least if there is a decent correction I can forget about things for a while and do some work. I don't even own much Crypto but it's fascinating to watch.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:31:05
If you do that it will crash badly and you will be stuck with the tattoo. It's called sod's law.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:11:39
Litecoin usualy follows BTC down in the dips. As does everything else. And don't mention Tether.
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:40:08
Not after they have seen the same crap 1000 times they don't.
@_date: 2018-05-24 06:37:52
Why does shit like this get up-voted?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:50
Having trouble getting on Coinbase too.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:16:13
I think Institutional Investors have helped push up the price. I have to say I am tempted to pull out and take my gains but despite all the concerns (and there are a number of potential issues on the Horizon 2018) I just feel it could have a long way to go yet but there will be bumps in 2018 I'm sure. 
There are a lot of red flags on the International scene relating to economies. I feel the dollar is fucked long term. In the UK and Europe there are storms brewing relating to debt again.  All these things could send Bitcoin rocketing further.
For me holding is the percentage call but if I couldn’t afford to lose what I have in Crypto (and it's not a lot) I would take it out. These posts about people investing their life savings give me a real bad feeling.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:03:18
Ahmen to that. Simple thing to remeber: If you can't afford to lose it then don't invest/gamble it.
@_date: 2018-11-27 12:17:36
What about the other impending clouds of doom such as the Mt.Gox distribution/dump and the investigations?
Maybe these are starting to be priced in?
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:27:29
Any Crypto related post headed 'This is huge' is not.
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:01:10
They should use this on the Powerball TV adverts. I hear players are declining. It makes the odds of winning look relatively good.
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:03:27
And what exactly made you jump in at this point?
And what do you think about the charts, ongoing investigations and up coming Mt.Gox distribution in terms of price movements?
