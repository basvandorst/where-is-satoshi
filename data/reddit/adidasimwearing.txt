If you think it will be rising buy the dips. If you think it will not, sell. Own the Bitcoin until you feel it owns you.
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:56:46
Although...possibly they bought through Mt. Gox?
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:42:18
Definitely and thank you for going easy!
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:56:56
I want to go on record to state that I have no idea what this is or means. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:27:56
I've got a small position and ready to make a bigger position. The ETF has me wondering when I should be buying. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:06:34
Monday is 3/13
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:11:02
Just wait...we're going to see the Treasury department issue their own cryptocurrency "Patriotcoin" or "Freedomcoin" so they can control it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:31:56
Damn. You are so right. It's not worth sitting on the sideline.
@_date: 2017-03-11 06:07:04
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:09:01
What happened to the 13th?
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:29:25
So if the ETF get's rejected you think that the price will dip? Makes sense because hedge funds won't be buying in if that's the case. 
Suddenly I'm paying attention. This got exciting. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:07:55
I saw it at 1050 on my Coinbase and I was just *sure* it was going to plummet to $700 and then bounce so I was definitely holding off to buy. Like an idiot I went back to work and lo and behold...
The strength of Bitcoin support was/is astounding. What a display today. Awesome.

Hello Mr. Zuckerberg! My wife is a big fan of FB. You can see our meals there. Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-03-07 00:12:58
Damn. That's awesome. I'm in the position of getting in at $650 and $800 and just sit and watch. Truly remarkable. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:23:31
I'm very worried that Bitcoin is proving to be massively too unstable for this thing to get approved. I have $10k cash ready to buy and nervous as hell. 
Is it too early to start drinking? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:07:49
Best advice here. Buy whatever however and then hold on tight. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 22:13:29
You spelled HODL wrong. Have another drink. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:12:58
Nice. I did witness it at 950 (Coinbase) but again I was just so GD smug about this sucker bouncing hard off of 700 so I stayed on the sidelines. I wonder if I had pulled the trigger if Coinbase would have given me that price. A lot of people were reporting "errors". 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:55:16
Well as much as I was right about the approval or lack thereof I'm beginning to think I smell a wolf in the hen house. The government obviously can't control Bitcoin so I wouldn't be surprised if they come up with a cryptocurrency of their own. Possibly hijack an existing cryptocurrency in order to control it or at least attempt to. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 01:28:34
My goal is to buy a car with bitcoin. I don't know where or how yet, new or used, but that's my goal. 
@_date: 2017-01-10 04:55:42
I bank at Bank Of America and Chase and have made one transaction to Coinbase via BofA. I have multiple accounts with both and several big loans. Please provide some proof OP of said action.
Anyone have problems with US Bank?
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:10:57
Uhm, only that I have cleared cash waiting to buy in my CB account!
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:09:46
With all the turmoil in the world I don't see how it could drop right now. I see gold increasing and in today's world I think Bitcoin is going to go along with it. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 22:54:41
Soooo...what price are we buying at?
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:18:23
Bitcoin is more and more fluid every day and has no borders or time constraints. I'm in since fall of '15 and bought just under $300. Totally forgot about my purchase until I heard in the news it hit $1k. Now I'm taking Bitcoin very seriously. 
@_date: 2017-01-30 04:08:42
So I had this dream where it dipped to $200 and I wanted to buy more...
@_date: 2016-12-25 01:57:59
Then who should we use?
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:22:38
MUCH better idea than Cryptosteel.Thank You!
@_date: 2017-04-29 19:57:57
That's awesome about GBTC. It's been hard to find a group that talks about GBTC. If you have a link I'd appreciate. I just started in my 401k and don't even care about the price currently. Just want to be in. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-05-11 23:31:34
Wake me when we're worried about Y2K again. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:36:26
That argument is valid for many countries not just the US. The rise of Bitcoin and crypto currency is a global movement.
@_date: 2017-05-24 06:05:11
I care, I mean, I pay someone to care now.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:55:47
For that much coin (joke intended) I hope you contacted the exchange privately. So tell us...what was your average strike price?
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:59:14
No kidding. There's quite a lot of activity like this in the alt-coin-verse that belongs there too. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 02:07:07
I love this time of night. It won't be long before NASDAQ decides it wants it's drive through open 24/7.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:03:18
With all due respect to OP...I worry about all this "dumb" money flowing into the market on the whole and the whales pulling profit creating unnecessary warbles in our time continuum. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:00:21
Guys stop with these shit coins. I can't even see USD on the exchanges.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:52:58
Fucking great meme. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 20:18:58
No QRC? What a bum.
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:19:46
Ew, like weird Becky.
@_date: 2017-05-01 13:10:33
I think it's both however any panic selling isn't going to show up like in the stock market. A panic sell would simply slosh around the exchanges with strong increases in BTC &amp; ETH. These are exciting days.
@_date: 2017-05-09 13:01:00
Possibly a wild piece of fiction. I've got an emergency fund I'm itching to put in play but I know better.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:56:19
I'm going to say he is lying but I'm doing it under my breath so he doesn't hear. 
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:57:48
The entire market is rising. The "Dumb" money has begun to arrive.
@_date: 2017-05-26 00:53:20
Yup. We don't want no parabolic shit coin drop.
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:13:37
You spelled 'hold' wrong. It's 'hodl"   
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:40:52
That is awesome! Please consult a tax professional before you get into any escrows.
