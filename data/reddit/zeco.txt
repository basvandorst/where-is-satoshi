Wouldn't it be more practical to chose a completely different word in order to prevent confusion?
It's a bit as if the Dollar was divided into 100 "Dots".
Also, I thought the mBTC denomination for 1/1000 BTC was called "millibits" already.
Aren't there any more distinguishable words that might make sense, like the one we already have for the smallest unit?
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:23:31
This is being pointed out very selectively though.
MtGox going belly-up? *This has nothing to do with the protocol!*
Spaceflights bought using bitcoin? *Hell yeah- good job, bitcoin!*
It's like insisting that Linux is merely a kernel. It's true on the technical level, but you know that it also refers to the wider ecosystem on top of it.
MtGox is definitely a part of the Bitcoin story and we would be wise to accept this, and to learn the right lessons from it.
@_date: 2014-03-02 15:18:08
We're gonna have to have a conversation on this regardless of what happened at MtGox.
Sooner or later the operators of the exchanges (and their families) will be scouted by criminals who wouldn't stop at anything for even 1/1000th of the values that are stored there.
Maybe there's some way to combine the blochain.info online wallet model with an exchange? (the trivial implementation would be to bothersome I guess, when each transaction would have to be done via blockchain)

There's a thing called [stylometric analysis]( which allegedly allows you to identify authors with an 80% success rate.
The Unabomber's correct but rare usage of the saying "you can't eat your cake and have it too" (instead of "having your cake and eating it too") was instrumental in identifying him. Back then the FBI published his writings and his [relatives recognized his style]( A high profile security expert like Nakamoto might be aware that he might be tracked through online data mining and adopt a kind of drunken writing style. (In theory. I'm still not convinced that this is the guy.)
... So just in case someone tries to stylometer my writing: Wassup y'all? whoo! me nogood Enrish .

Thank you, very interesting!
So according to [bitcoincharts.com]( the date when 1 BTC crossed $0.01 was July 12th 2010, 2 pm UTC on BitcoinMarket.com.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:04:29
For all I know it's got to have been at some point between May 22nd 2010, when the [2 pizzas were sold for 10k BTC]( (so 1 BTC = ~$0.0025) and July 17 2010, when the first exchange price was recorded at 1 BTC = $0.04951.
I guess the exact moment when it hit $0.01 can not be determined.
EDIT: Turns out the date could be determined after all. Chart updated.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:16:50
Eh, it's just what it is.
Bitcoin's been through a lot, good and bad. The later fate of MtGox († February 24th 2014) will always serve as a Memento Mori to be mindful of.

Did you backup the blockchain app using Titanium?
This might have made the data available to apps with access to the SD card.
In case the data were stolen using root access that would mean that other app data might have been compromised as well. If you had a private ssh key stored in ConnectBot, I recommend you generate a new one and replace the public key on your remote hosts' .ssh/authorized_keys files.

There's so much spam and misinformation out there that I didn't even bother to watch the video. Now I myself [documented]( such an issue. How on earth are you supposed to recognize serious concerns among all the BUY! SELL! PANIC! chatter...
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:29:08
nope, I don't want any of it.
I want this whole thing reversed, no matter where the other exchanges' rates are when btc24 resumes.
(I wanted to cancel right away but I thought what if the Euro balance isn't restored?)
I also think this is the only viable solution since the tradebook was completely messed up so no transaction should count after the first problems occured.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:06:02
Services like bitpay are great, but they're centralised and prone to having service issues, vulnerable to hacking etc. Also they're not suited for any size business.
It'd be much better for Bitcoin if transactions would take place without 3rd parties (while they're still useful for shops who don't want to handle the tech themselves).
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:16:49
holy cow...
I googled "BTC24 SEPA withdraw" before I ever put my money there to check whether there were any complaints. I didn't find anything back then but perhaps I haven't looked closely enough?
Have you tried to contact the admin?
Does anyone know if this is this a bigger issue?

bitcoin *acceptance* is at risk. People in the nonspeculative parts of the bitcoin economy (vendors, service providers) still have to be wary of the exchange volatility even if the exact rate doesn't matter to them.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:16:24
Still. The volatility...
Bitcoin won't succeed much if these kind of swings stay common. It just took Mtgox 30min to fall from $1000 to $840. So in the average time it takes to get 3 blockchain confirmations you can lose 16% of the value.
So far the overall swing this weekend was -32% (most of it today). I remember occasional 20-25% swings from the beginning of the year but I was hoping these would wane as Bitcoin got more circulation.
Of course you can catch the train in the other direction too, but I don't know whether regular shops want to put up with this.

I think this will also strangle the market for smaller payments, which could be really important for Bitcoin.
Wanna sell a newspaper for 50ct? since the standard transaction fee is 3.9ct right now, that'll be a 7.8% transaction fee. (rising fast)
I think a certain fee is justified, but a fixed one that's completely oblivious of market rates is just a bad idea.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:38:56
btw the [btc24 hotwallet]( was empty since about an hour before the trading issues came up ([this]( being the last notable tx) so nobody was able to run off with those faulty Bitcoin gains. So the admin should be able to revert the trades without missing any money.
The question is merely how and to which point the trades will be reverted. No matter what he choses here, some people will incur losses through this if the other exchanges don't happen to be at roughly the same rates as they were before this issue.
@_date: 2013-04-13 09:57:51
This must be very stressful for you but the sooner we get any info the better (no matter what it is).
What about this trading bug, which is the actual issue that triggered the site's emergency halt yesterday? How will the faulty trades be reverted?
btw I'd say the trading api should also be suspended for now since it's probably pointless and it's weirding people out to see the movement (EDIT: apparently the API is disabled, but some people circumvent cloudflare by using your mailserver's IP and log in that way via Web interface).
@_date: 2013-04-02 08:36:35
depending on the nature of the flash drive there sadly also is a chance that the internal memory controller frequently resets storage cells that have been marked as deleted on the fat32 filesystem (to increase writing speed for new data).
casper-rw is an ext2 image inside a fat32 filesystem, so I'm not sure how data would be handled that have been changed inside that file.
It probably varies by flash drive models (I only read about this controller behaviour when I investigated why writing speeds on an ext-formatted SD-Card of mine dropped significantly compared to when it was fat32)
Could OP perhaps tell us the exact USB stick model that was used?
Another thing: It appears that OP searched for possible wallet file sizes of 8-50000 bytes length. The recovered .info file (that matches the [lost address]( however said "property,walletFileSize,104". So the only size to look for is 104 bytes (tested myself, this property always exactly matches the .wallet filesize).
Isn't it a good sign that the .info file could still be recovered? Since the [source code]( says that both files should be deleted using the same secureDelete method, if it didn't work with one, why should it have worked with the other?
