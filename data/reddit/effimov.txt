Who cares. They are helping to undermine states. If they don't support a stateless society they still help make that a reality by investing in bitcoin. Shout out to all the money hungry braindead bitcoin investors out there.

Taxation is theft.

Do you suddenly stop supporting a cause that you like? Yes if you can't afford it but No if you can afford.
Don't invest braindead in other crypto coins, many of them are terrible especially Ripple (XRP). I don't get why any, especially from the bitcoin community, would support a centralized coin.

A lot of Coinbases newer customers probably don't even know how the bitcoin technology works and that, if bitcoin were to become widely adopted, it will destroy not only banks but also states. They are simply joining the bitcoin hype because of the money instead of supporting the idea of a decentralized payment system. What will happen when all the "modern slaves" realize this? Will they simply keep their stake or sell it all in fear.

WAIT: So you support bitcoin and recommend people to pay their taxes at once how does that make any sense. If the people who keep printing more money didn't exist in the first place, bitcoin might not have been needed.

While we are at it please put the IRS at fire as well.

If it cant be controlled it cant be taxed.

I have seen multiple good bitcoin paintings on r/bitcoin but this I don't see any deeper meaning in this. You answered my question with a question so I take it as a no.

Maybe, no one can for sure say that we would not have achieved the same results without government funding. 
In wartime, some very important things have indeed been developed by government funds.

So because they pay for some education system you never really asked for/wanted you are now forced to pay taxes? What sort of mafia methods is that?

Where power can be abused it will be abused with certainty.

You deserve an upvote. All government fiat is trash. Real estate is useless, you never really own it, the government does, through taxation.

What sort of delusional socialist are you? I never claimed to not pay taxes. The blockchain technology is not meant to be controlled by anyone. Taxes are great to keep the local community running but obviously, the way taxation is working right now is not right e.g fundings wars for a hidden agenda. The so-called Democrazy you probably also support and believe in is nothing more than a modern way of slavery. You are not truly free, your body is owned by the state. Have fun in your bubble.

Does it have any deeper meaning or just some painting with a bitcoin logo on?
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:53:48
wOOOT the first?! I thought they already had plenty there ....

This sub-reddit got filled up with statists in the last year. I'm out.
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:53:08
How long does it take to pay in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:06:07
I know there have been a few cases where people were able to deactiviate their 2FA by emailing bitstamps support!
@_date: 2017-07-03 13:07:47
Even though you just started have anyone paid in BTC yet?
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:54:36
What a piece of junk..
@_date: 2017-06-27 12:49:17
The crypto market has and still is getting flooded with money hungry investors. Not a single top 10 crypto coin represent its actual value. Too much hype, not even worth holding atm.
