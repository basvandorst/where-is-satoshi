This is correct. We are in contact with top regulatory counsel to ensure our business stays compliant, and we are also staying aware of developing regulations.
At this stage, just like on LocalBitcoins, if a user is selling in a manner that makes them a business, they are responsible for making sure they are also compliant with their state laws and FinCEN if necessary.

Thanks a bunch! :)
Us and Libertyx **feel** very similar to the user, but function very differently of course. Libertyx directly sells Bitcoins to users leveraging their network of convenience stores. BitQuick connects buyers and sellers, and has buyers pay at a local bank branch.
In either case, you are going to a physical location, and depositing cash.
LocalBitcoins on the other hand is like the wild west. Browse through 100's of payment methods, and different offers, make sure the seller has a positive reputation, and then keep your fingers crossed you haven't stumbled upon a hacked LBC seller account.
Long story short, there is too much risk associated with LBC. There is no risk whatsoever with BitQuick.

Hi there,
Wondering what forum we "spammed" you at? We targetted LocalBitcoins users and asked them to provide feedback for our developing service.
We do not intend to ever engage in deceptive, or spamming tactics.

Unfortunately PayPal is not the safest way to sell BTC. What a shame, considering the fact that it is obviously in demand.
However, if you would like to sell your Bitcoin within hours and receive payment instantly, look no further than [BitQuick.co](
If you would like to sell via BitQuick, all that's needed is to fill out the form at [bitquick.co/sell]( fund the provided Bitcoin address, and confirm cash deposits to your account (if your coins are reasonably priced, they should easily sell within less than one business day, often even the same day).
You can find more details at [bitquick.co/how-to]( but please feel free to give us a shout if you ever have any questions!

You will need to sell either 1 BTC or 3 BTC to receive the $5 or $10. 
However, there is something for everybody in this promotion. We have waived withdrawal fees as well, so selling on BitQuick is absolutely 100% free! No transaction fees (there never are), and, for the duration of this promo, zero withdrawal fees. I'm almost certain that at the moment we are the only service around that lets you sell for free with no strings attached or hidden mark-ups. So even if you do not have enough BTC to qualify for the free money, you can have the absolute freedom of selling Bitcoin on your own terms and receiving cash into your account instantly.

Hey there, BitQuick.co here! It looks like we had actually sent you a message right away informing you that your ban had been removed, and we did not receive a response until 10:00 P.M. EST (about 7 hours later). The hold was removed because you needed to send a picture of your receipt to us so that we could know that you had paid, this can be done by using a link that is sent via email to upload it to BitQuick. The link will not work if it has been more than 3 hours since you have placed your hold, per our policy. 
We are going to get this taken care of as soon as we are able, but we will first need a photo of the receipt. As stated, your ban has been removed, and you will not lose your money. In situations like this, we will have the seller refund the buyer's money if there are not enough coins left for sale in the order. 
Thanks for your time, we look forward to getting this resolved as soon as possible. We'll be happy to answer any additional questions that you might have during the process as well.

Founder of BitQuick here, Jad. I'm also the founder of the Bitcoin Group here at The Ohio State University and just wanted to say that after watching both documentaries in their entirety, this analysis was spot on.

Hello, Chad from BitQuick.co here!   
I am very sorry to hear that you were experiencing reservations about our service. I would like to emphasize that we are an absolutely legitimate and professional business, and have been proudly servicing the Bitcoin community since July of 2013.

We also have a page on BitTrust.org that allows users to rate, review, and compare our service. To date, BitQuick.co has an aggregate user rating of 4.78/5.00 stars out of 63 reviews. Our BitTrust page can be viewed [here.](
We have an [Angel List page]( as well if you would like to view our team, and our support staff is always happy to address any and all questions or concerns that you may have. If you would like, you can reach me personally at Chad
Our service offers a unique marketplace-style platform that can serve as a safe alternative to the many other slow and cumbersome services.

[Check us out!]( It's only 2% to buy, and always free to sell.

Are you angry that I am making you look on the website to answer all your questions?
All the answers to your questions are literally a 30 second scroll on these two URL's:  
The questions that weren't answered, such as who is our lawyer and company lawyer, were not answered because that is inappropriate without context.
We use Cloudflare Advanced DDOS protecton and the website is secured by HTTPS throughout. Most importantly, all Bitcoin are held in cold storage.
We realize that not everyone reads Reddit so we figured it would be useful to have all that information easily accessible by all of our customers.
And I still disagree that every new Bitcoin business deserves a hostile welcome. I think we should encourage innovators. We've been around for 6 months by the way. So we're not new to everyone.

Correct, our initial live version did not have timestamps. 
Regarding the order IDs, your suggestions have been noted and will be acted upon.

edit: The order ID's have been updated. Before, it was actually set so that orders could have 7 or 8 digit IDs but it has been adjusted so that order IDs can vary all the way from 5 to 8 digits, greatly reducing any odds of a collision. There is also a collision detector just in case, which will generate another unique order ID.

When we say "No Fees. Ever", we are referring to the fact that there are no transaction fees for sellers. You can leave your coins listed for sale until they sell, free of charge. There is a conditional 5% withdrawal fee if you wish to withdraw your order since it is free to sell, but it is capped at 0.02 BTC. This amount can eventually decrease as well if the price of BTC drastically increases.
We specified that we were only referring to selling in that text, we have never claimed that we charge no fees for buyers. The fees do not add up either, they are separate. Sellers sell for free, and are only charged the withdrawal fee if they withdraw their order. Buyers are always charged 2% for each transaction unless we are running a promotion.
@_date: 2014-03-24 01:48:08
We do not.

Jad Mubaslat, Founder and CEO of BitQuick.
Wow! First off, this post is riddled with falsehoods and is certainly done from a disgruntled individual with a personal agenda no doubt. The plethora of personal information is interesting as well, but nothing you can't find out about us by digging on the web! Check us out: [Linkedin]( [YouTube]( [In depth article on behind the scenes at BitQuick](
First off, the individual **Justin McCarthy is not an employee of BitQuick. We have verified this post was not made by an employee of BitQuick LLC**


Doesn't seem you tried the service. Also, who calls us BitQuick LLC? We are always known as BitQuick.co


You can be the judge on my professional experience, this article gives an in depth look on my background: 


Chad Davis is 2 years into his studies and has put his education on hold to focus full time on BitQuick. Are we really about to criticize a college student for dropping out to run a startup? I think we're past that: 


No we do not. We are currently on a shared server and will be moving very shortly to new servers. We are well aware of the risks associated with a shared server, which is why no sensitive financial information, or private keys are ever stored online (nor need to be).


We cannot disclose our verification system in depth as it would defeat the purpose of such, but essentially, yes, we do implement a variety of checks to verify the authenticity of the users on our website as we have a strict stance *against* money laundering. A great portion of future funding rounds will be used to make our system more robust than it already is. To date, none of our users have ever been scammed from their money by using our system and we take pride in that!


Our mailbox is in Cincinnati. And yes, of course we work on our laptops. We're a tech startup! 


Only 2 employees have access to the private keys. **This also just seems racist.** 


We are frequently consulting legal counsel and this is not a matter we take lightly. We are not operating illegally.


Once again, feel free to be the judge:  I am the founder of the Ohio State Bitcoin Group as well and Alan also is an adviser on that group but that in no way causes any inherent conflict of interest.


Hopefully after seeing how ludicrous these concerns are, you'll see the claims made are nothing to be take seriously. If anything, we recommend you give our service a try! 
Or come see me Chad and Alan at our Columbus Bitcoin Meetup! 
Nervous? Check our plethora of reviews! Please ignore the first one that is angry about us being college students, it seemed to have been posted at the same time as this post! 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:24:11
They're us! Same team, but we allow the trading of Altcoins. They will be receiving a site upgrade soon as well.
@_date: 2014-11-14 23:08:06


Well, I would first like to say that users do not even need to sign up! No accounts are needed to use our service. 


This question was addressed in our most recent Bitcoin Magazine article, which was linked in the description of the video (I've added some additional notes in bold as well): 
"I will just go ahead and list the reasons for you because there are simply so many:
– Never leave the comfort of your home. **(Sellers can just link their account and receive cash).**
– No fees. Ever. **(Selling on BitQuick carries a transaction fee of 0%).**
– Quick: receive cash deposited straight into your bank account within hours. **(If coins are listed at a reasonable rate and aren't priced too much higher than market rate, they are almost guaranteed to sell within 1 business day after you list them, maybe even the same day if they are near market rate. Our buyers are always looking for a good deal).**
– Protected by BitQuick’s seller guarantee. No more scams! **(Unlike LocalBitcoins, we offer secure and consistent arbitration here at BitQuick. If you confirm deposits within 3 hours, you will protected from any fraudulent deposits, and the money you receive is 100% guaranteed).**
– Set your own price and order limits. **(Set and change your own minimum sell amount and price any time you like. You can also peg the price of your order to the exchange rate of BitStamp and BitFinex, as well as Bitcoinaverage.com).**
– Fair playing field for all sellers. **(All sellers are on the same terms, so there's no need for reputation or ratings for sellers since BitQuick is the one that distributes the funds to the buyer, and we always do so in a timely manner).**
– Simple. **(Our service is very simple to use, and you can get started right away! No hoops to jump through, just link your bank account and receive cash).**
– Insured deposits with Xapo coming soon. **(Soon, Xapo will be providing multi-signature capability and insured deposits for BitQuick. Xapo is a trusted company that has received $60 million dollars in venture capital funding).**
When consumers want Bitcoin immediately with cash, many find themselves resorting to the Craigslist-style marketplace, LocalBitcoins. The problem with LocalBitcoins is that there is no secure arbitration or consistent guidelines. Scams are rampant, and if you get scammed once when trying to obtain your first Bitcoin, you could easily become deterred away from the process and end up being too afraid to try again. People seem to find themselves more comfortable with using a trusted service that makes sure that each transaction is handled smoothly and safely."
Those were only reasons why selling is better, but many of them are the same for buyers, and buyers receive some of their own unique benefits from our service as well.

Hello, BitQuick.co here!
If you would like to make a deposit, you can go to any local branch of your order's bank. 
For example, if you place a hold on a Bank of America order, you would receive your bitcoin in 3 steps:
1. Go to a local Bank of America branch and make a cash deposit using the details given to you.
2. Send a photo or scan of your receipt to orders
3. Receive bitcoins! 
It can take up to 3 hours for coins to be sent, although we usually try to have them sent in less than 90 minutes. 
We are always open to talk if you have any further questions about our service, please feel free to ask!

Hi there,
This statement seems to assume that we either (i) are actually accepting deposits directly or (ii) that our customers are MSBs.
(i) is not true, as we are simply connecting buyers and sellers, not directly accepting any cash.
(ii) is not true. Our sellers (who are bank customers) may end up being characterized as MSBs, but only if they deal in sufficient volume and frequency.
We're constantly consulting top regulatory council in the ecosystem to ensure our system stays compliant in a constantly evolving landscape, and that ultimately we make our best effort to protect our consumers.
@_date: 2014-06-10 20:07:19
Jad here... we publish public proof of our reserves and keep all Bitcoin in cold storage. We take extensive measures to ensure the security of our users, and we're never complacent either. We're always looking to make the system more robust (i.e. implementation of multi-sig escrow coming soon!)
We are raising funds now because I know that while we are a small team currently, everyone needs to start somewhere. We are a team of young entrepreneurs becoming professionals everyday. We will not become the next Mt. Gox. I am not afraid to ask for help, unlike Mr. Karpeles, and am always learning more.

Any of you can act as a third party to verify our funds.
Here are some instructions to verify yourself:
1. Find an order on  and place a hold on that order for a small test amount.
2. Visit  and find the escrowaddress for that particular order.
3. Pay for your order and see if the address you receive your Bitcoin from is the same as the escrow address you found in step 2.
Also we would be more than glad to do a test transaction from any escrow chosen at random displayed on the API page. :)

The buyer's 2% transaction fee is irrelevant to the seller, as is the seller's withdrawal fee to the buyer. 
The way our service works:
Sellers place orders for sale. Normally services like Coinbase and LocalBitcoins will charge a transaction fee for users that wish to sell Bitcoin (I believe they each charge 1%). We do not. To offset the fact that we allow users to sell Bitcoin without a transaction fee, we have added in a small withdrawal fee. It is not at all used to "trap" sellers, typically the only reason sellers are unable to sell coins is because they have them priced too high. For those intending to sell bitcoin for a reasonable price (but still pretty much always above market rate by some margin), the withdrawal fee should not be an issue, especially since they are using the service for free anyway. 
Sellers are able to set their own rates for their orders (we do not buy or sell any bitcoin ourselves, we are a marketplace and just arbitrate transactions between buyers and sellers). If the seller marks their order above the current exchange rate, this does not have anything to do with us or our fees. The whole point of selling Bitcoin on BitQuick is to sell at the price of your choice, we do not determine any prices. 
As for buyers, they are charged a 2% transaction fee. So if a seller sells 0.2 BTC for $100, they get all $100, but the buyer will have a 2% fee subtracted from the 0.2 BTC that they are buying (so they will end up receiving 0.196 BTC once the transaction is complete). We provide a service to our users, so unfortunately we do need to charge some fees in order to keep the business going.


I'm not quite sure what you're saying here, but here's a TL;DR of our fee structure again:
**Transaction fees:**
-Buyers: 2%
-Sellers: 0%
**Withdrawal fees:**
-Buyers: 0% (N/A)
-Sellers: 5% (capped at 0.02 BTC, meaning it won't ever go higher than that) **NOTE: At the moment we are running a promotion, so until 12/1/2014 there are no withdrawal fees.**

We don't need to be prodded to make our customers happy I assure you, we value each and every one of them!
One of our biggest values is our [seller's guarantee]( which is used for mistakes made by us. In addition, we don't shoulder any fees to the seller. You get what you ask for on BitQuick.
I do appreciate you looking out for the community in any case though! Had we failed to responded, this would have been good action to take by OP.

Hi there,
We're certainly not a scam! But we do apologize for the inconvenience that you have experienced. Unfortunately we don't have a record of an unfulfilled  $500 transaction, could you please email orders with your order details so that we can look into this further?

You may want to try out [BitQuick.co]( We narrow the process of buying (and selling) down to a couple of simple steps.
To buy, just select your order that you wish to purchase from via [bitquick.co/buy-2]( place a hold on the order, and go to your local bank and make a cash deposit, or SEPA transfer for EU customers. Once you upload a photo of your receipt to BitQuick, your BTC are sent (they are sent within 3 hours once you upload your receipt, usually within less than an hour).
You can find out more at [bitquick.co/how-to]( but don't hesitate to [contact us]( we'd love to help!
Welcome to the Bitcoin world!

Thanks for pointing this out! We set what we thought would be the most reasonable terms. The terms are 10% ABOVE market rate, not below. So, you can price your coins at a 10% premium (above current prices), have them sell within a day (or perhaps not) and receive money for at the very least having them listed for one business day with the price being no greater than 10% above BitFinex's last price.
You can also sell as little as 1 BTC to earn $5 or 0.013 BTC (whichever is greater).
Edit: Thanks for the heads up about the description, we've just changed it.

Hey Jad Mubaslat, CEO/Founder here.
First of all, I want to sincerely apologize for any headache/confusion our system may have caused. We do have a few quirks with the website, but are continuing to improve all the time. The invalid entry bug has been noted.
Also, we offer a [seller's guarantee]( so you will be reimbursed in the case of an accidental hold, or system malfunction. I'm not sure which pricing bug you are referencing in specific, but you should have been compensated in full, as per protocol.
Now I think there is some confusion. I looked into this issue in specific regarding the $200 and this was a simple miscommunication. We've emailed you back, but to be short, a hold was being replaced for the buyer. An issue with overselling occured, which is not systematic but an error from a buyer, which we cannot control. Please see: 
Full summary:
* You will always be given a refund/compensation for an error on BitQuick's behalf, [it's our guarantee](
* We do apologize for any bugs in the system, "Select a bank..." shouldn't be an acceptable bank option. Please contact support, and we'll give you a small bug bounty reward as well.
* No ghost orders, just correcting a buyer misstep similar to what happened [here](
Most importantly, our customers should never have to endure any type of fiscal loss due to fault of ourselves. If you do, contact us and we will happily reimburse you promptly.
We highly value our customers, and aim to make each of you individually pleased. I am sorry that our service ultimately made you feel this way, but do want to make sure you feel like right has been done by you.
Please contact me or support directly for more assistance on this issue.

Hello - Chad from BitQuick support here! We've just contacted you regarding this order, we apologize for the delay.
@_date: 2016-12-10 21:32:03
Sorry for the inconvenience you're experiencing! We're open and processing transactions currently.
Delays can happen for a variety of reasons, including late deposits, improper writing on the receipt, etc.
I understand it may not necessarily be one of those. In any case, feel free to shoot us a PM with more details so we can look up your order!
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:39:58
The email he showed is a screenshot of is his confirmation email. He uploaded the manipulated receipts, so an email was sent saying he'd receive the funds within 3 hours. We send another email once the funds are actually sent.
Now of course once we noticed the receipts were manipulated, we could not send funds. And from our perspective, if the ToS is not violated, then the uploader is the same person as the buyer. If an uploader uploads a fake receipt, they would have no reasonable expectation of receiving funds. In this case, the buyer was not the same person as the uploader, which allowed the buyer to be scammed.
We have this clause in our ToS specifically for this reason (in addition to KYC/AML reasons)
@_date: 2016-12-03 13:42:34
This is another good example of why we can't permit third party deposits. While some people have legitimate use cases for doing such, it opens a risky can of worms.

Glad to hear it! :)

Hi there,
We have been in communication with you this evening via email. It seems that what happened is you are reselling Bitcoin to other individuals. So you are placing an order on behalf of them, and uploading their receipts. This is a violation of our ToS. 
Due to fraud risks, we can't allow that type of activity. What happened was you were sent 3 fake receipts from your clients. You released BTC to them before we had ever completed your transaction. We could not complete the transactions because all the receipts were manipulated.
We understand your frustration, but unfortunately there is nothing we can do. 3 fake receipts were uploaded and we were then unable to proceed with the purchase and ban you from the serivce due to ToS violation.

We allow anyone, even the unbanked to buy bitcoins instantly with cash anywhere in the USA. We're geared towards the small time speculator (~$300 purchases usually), and people looking to spend or send BTC instantly (i.e. remittances). We're not aimed towards those who want to stay off the grid, or perform black market activities. We provide privacy from other users, but not anonymity from law enforcement.
I'd say something that is truly unique about us is that we're the only USA P2P marketplace that offers a guarantee against scams!

It seems many companies received funding, then outspent their budgets to make investors happy with rapid growth.

It's split pretty evenly among everything to be honest. Which can be difficult at times. But it's important to keep all fronts moving, and I believe it is important for our customers to be able to see tangible progress. It's easy to get caught up in regulatory affairs, but at the same time you have to just go out and create something. Always be making that best faith effort, have strong morals, and things will typically work out. It requires dedication, and extreme time management as well.
I'll be honest though, I love every minute of it. It doesn't feel like work. It's amazing to be able to service hundreds of customers each day, and continue to work on a product you genuinely love.

We're hoping to integrate other online payment methods soon enough. It's difficult because we connect buyers and sellers, and don't directly accept payment.
For now, we're doing cash, but that'll change soon enough! I really appreciate your detailed feedback sir.

That is correct though, we did recently integrate with Coinkite! We've seen a couple users each day from it, and it seems to have been super helpful for newbies onramping for Backpage.com.
They sign up for Coinkite.com, then without ever needing to leave Coinkite, they can buy bitcoins from BitQuick. Love it!

But then we expose our customers to the risks associated with pure P2P trading.
While that may be ideal for advanced users, and those who want to stay "off the grid", that is not our end goal. 
We are providing a service that the everyday consumer can use, and will ideally suit the mainstream consumer as Bitcoin adoption grows.

We don't have any plans to lower the fees yet, as our prices are still very competitive amongst other marketplaces. We're open to feedback, but we feel the 2% buy fee is a fair charge.

Hey guys,
We're looking to integrate new payment methods and wanted to know what payment methods are most in demand.
We also want to know what additional features would help you P2P sellers.
We've already implemented our [seller's guarantee]( which means you cannot be scammed when selling on BitQuick, something no other P2P platform can offer.
We're also looking to develop a way to forward compliance information to seller's who consider themselves MSB's and have registered with FinCEN. This would make compliance a cinch for very large sellers.
Feedback? We will be tipping top quality answers here, and on ZapChain. Feel free to comment on either.
@_date: 2015-08-29 00:31:04
Already answered, please search :) Still have a tip though!

Hold up! Not "BitQuick.com" it is **BitQuick.co**
.com is a scam domain.
For large transactions, we do require ID as well though, so unfortunately, we may not be the best place if you have issue with ID.
Fortunately we provide guarantees on every transaction! We review each transaction to ensure there are no scams. If anything gets through, we take the loss. Never our customers.

As a regulated financial institution, we're not aimed at people who want to remain anonymous, but those who want to remain private.
None of that information will be disclosed to a third party ever.
At that, it isn't enough information to withdraw any money from your bank account.
We'll certainly look into supporting PGP, it just isn't in demand from our mainstream audience at the moment.

The part with the 0.98 and the fee is just all.. screwy.
Would love to hear more feedback from the community how to make this process even easier!
Also we have a short 3 step guide for [how to buy bitcoins on backpage](
@_date: 2015-07-23 23:12:15
No, no, no not the logic here at all.
My logic is I presume it is legal for Backpage.com to operate because they accepted CC until the CC's pulled out, and still accept cash and openly operate within the United States.
It's not inherently illegal like the SilkRoad.
It seems they have a pretty strong legal standing:

That is correct. Just the account name and number is disclosed.

Simple, we implement various measures to ensure MITM and other sophisticated scams don't get through. Your job is to make money trading. Our job is to weed out fraudsters. When we both focus on what we're best at, we all benefit.
So in the specific case you mentioned, our measures will likely cases prevent that MITM, but in the case one slipped through, we would simply reimburse you in BTC in full if the bank ended up seizing any $$ whatsoever.
Also, the reason I am being somewhat vague about our fraud detection measures is because it does defeat the purpose if we disclose exactly how we weed out fraud. But the important detail being, if we didn't do our job, you get your $$ back ;)

As we have expressed to you through our support team various times, this issue will take time to resolve and we will have to wait for the seller to initiate a refund.
Not only did you initiate an ACH transfer, you sent 2 of them by accident (double paid the seller for your single order), and then uploaded your proof of payment late after your order had expired, so the BTC were no longer available. These compounded issues have resulted in delays processing your refund.
We are doing everything in our power to assist you. These issues can easily be avoided by paying on time, and using accepted payment methods (cash deposit) only in the future.

BitQuick.co here - sorry for chiming in late. We're glad that you found our site and have considered using it! We wanted to address some of the concerns that were mentioned. 
While you won't be able to know the exact identity of who you're trading with, unless you're granted access to our compliance API as an MSB, our protected escrow/arbitration system and seller's guarantee are what sets us apart from other peer-to-peer trading services. We eliminate the need to know who you're trading with and arbitrate the transaction for you. Having been in business for more than 4 years, we are very familiar with 3rd-party scams that are out there, and how to prevent them behind the scenes with our own proprietary fraud prevention system.
Regarding the reversibility of cash deposits - while it is not 100% impossible to reverse a cash deposit made at a bank branch, for all intents and purposes it is the most immutable payment method available in the United States, making it the most suitable way at the moment for trading Bitcoin peer-to-peer.As an added layer of protection, in accordance with our seller's guarantee, you will be reimbursed for any fraudulent reversals as long as you confirm or dispute deposits within 3 hours upon request. We would encourage you to try our service out!
Thank you,
BitQuick.co Support
@_date: 2015-04-05 17:07:01
Actually we collect receipts from the buyer so we can look out for that. In addition, we ask that seller's confirm the amount is in their available balance. A check will result in some pending balance amount. We're always on the lookout for the next fraudster.
We do perform KYC/AML utilizing [NetVerify by Jumio]( to verify ID's. We will soon be implementing SMS verification and [Blockscore]( verification as well. Our aim is to serve the whitehat portion of the LocalBitcoins market by implementing reasonable KYC/AML procedures to ensure consumer protection.
Thanks for your support!

It is not included in the 1.5595 BTC being sent, so you would send 1.5597 total, with 1.5595 BTC arriving to BitQuick.
So you're understanding is correct.

Hi there,
BitQuick support here. It is not a support error that is occurring, but a customer error that we can't control.
When a buyer places a hold, they have 3 hours to make the deposit into the seller's account. If they make the deposit after 3 hours (as is the case here), we have to contact the seller to see what type of resolution is amicable.
We can't allow holds to remain longer than 3 hours because then there is a huge volatility risk. If you ever receive a late deposit, we recommend you deduct any losses from the BTC amount you agree to give to the late buyer.
We also incur the buyer a late fee for having BitQuick and the seller go through the resolution process.
Please email jad regarding the 8+ BTC error, we will always reimburse a user for a mistake like that on BitQuick's behalf. I do apologize if you did not receive reimbursement in a timely manner, as you should have.
I hope this was helpful in clearing up some of the confusion!
@_date: 2015-09-01 03:11:32
Hi there,
Sorry to have made you uncomfortable, we certainly are not stealing your coin! The order had to be manually set live because the exact amount of BTC were not sent to the order. There was a mistake doing the manual update, so it took an additional 2 hours for us to correct that. Your order is now set live!
We had no intention of lying to you, just a small mistake. We wouldn't want to blow our reputation over a small amount of BTC.
I guarantee you the rest of your selling experience will be very smooth. Just sit back, and wait for the cash deposits to arrive!
Sorry for your worries,
Jad Mubaslat
@_date: 2015-04-28 20:18:56

The next step is for services to use Bitcoin in the backend and actually make these processes automatic.
Needless to say, we're working on it ;)
@_date: 2015-09-01 03:52:17
You would send 1.5595 BTC, and an additional 0.0002 BTC fee.

Hey all,
We've received a few emails regarding this, some sellers asking how we protect against MITM attacks like the one described. BitQuick.co is a platform that allows people to [buy bitcoin]( with cash instantly from listed sellers in escrow.
The matter of the fact is that we take on the responsibility of weeding out MITM attacks, and cover our sellers with our [seller's guarantee]( Weeding out fraudsters involves various data analysis, and we can't reveal all of our tactics for obvious reasons. We've been fully aware of these scams even before we launched in August, 2013.
But that is the key difference of our platform. We have the ability to collect enough information to weed out scammers, and protect sellers. Other marketplaces put that responsibility on the seller. We allow Bitcoin sellers to focus on profits and providing liquidity instead of weeding out fraudsters.
For compliant sellers, we even have an API that streamlines everything for you. Contact us if you're interested!

Hi Frankenmint,
I think you may be confusing a few things! We are being offered an additional 300 BTC by Draper Associates, not Coinbase. Coinbase is unrelated to the 300 BTC entirely.
Also, the only information you are given from the seller is their name and account number. This is not anywhere near enough information to commit fraud, or more importantly, any type of withdrawal or debit to the account.
It's completely safe, and this is less information than you include when writing someone a check.
Hope you'll give us another look and reconsider! Happy to answer additional questions you may have. 
We're not trying to be just another exchange, we're trying to change the way that peer to peer trading is done. We want to be the next Bitcoin marketplace that makes it truly simple, safe and quick to sell or [buy bitcoin](
I also want to take a moment to emphasize that we are the furthest thing from Mt. Gox. When Mt. Gox went under, we became the first Bitcoin marketplace to implement publically verifiable proof of our reserves. BitGo also provides our holdings with up to $250,000 of insurance. We value the safety of our customers. If you'd like to read more, [click here]( and [here](

If your coins are listed within 2% of market rate, they'll sell almost instantly via cash deposit. So you'll have access to your money instantly, instead of waiting 3-5 days for a bank transfer to clear like most platforms, and fetch more $/BTC!
We are similar to LocalBitcoins in that we are a P2P marketplace, but have some major key differentiators:

**Edit**: We need to be fair to Coinbase too. To be clear, Coinbase is NOT going to steal your money. You are not going to need to file a police report. Coinbase has $75M in investment money, they're not going to steal from a customer. They simply don't need it. Now unfortunately they do have a strict compliance program, but honestly they are a pretty smooth on ramp for most new Bitcoiners if you don't mind a 3-5 business day wait for your first purchase and have a bank account.
Wanted to go ahead a plug a reminder about our service, [BitQuick.co]( too. We're a little less known than LBC, Coinbase and the likes but have been around since August, 2013 and have done over 7500 transactions to date.
We're changing the way peer to peer trading is done, making it safer, simpler and more intuitive.
* No meeting in person for trades, it's all done with cash deposit
* No bank account needed to buy
* **Only service that can guarantee BTC in your wallet from cash in your pocket in under 3 hours**
* No risk of being scammed - we got your back
* Holdings secured with BitGo multisignature wallets
* A [Boost.VC]( backed company

Jad Mubaslat, CEO of BitQuick here. 
Wow! Lots of interesting feedback here. First of all, I want to point out that **this is not a paid article**. [Diano Ngo]( of CT spoke with me to get the article done, and had previously covered our expansion to the [Middle East]( and implementation of [Multisignature addresses]( I understand some of those things may not be interesting to everyone, but I think they are at the very *least* worthy of being reported on.
Also, **yes, Boost.VC is invested in us**, Adam Draper is the CEO of Boost.VC and we were accepted into Boost.VC Tribe 5, the largest Bitcoin business accelerator. I think it is a bit farfetched to imply that a Bitcoin business getting into Boost.VC is not worth being reported on.
Also, we do not engage in coin tracking. Please understand that we need to collect personal information if we want to offer consumer protections. **We do not have an anti-privacy stance.** I personally do not believe  LocalBitcoins is sustainable or conducive for mainstream adoption. I understand that one of its heavy selling points is you have the option of 100% anonymity. But that comes with risks for uninformed consumers. How can you tell if you're about to get scammed or put in a dangerous situation? 
**At the end of the day, both us and LocalBitcoins want to drive mainstream adoption, but we have different philosophies on how that can be achieved.**
Also regarding the  that is a completely different service. They sell bitcoin for vouchers to non-US customers. Unfortunately when I started this back in August, 2013 bitquick.com was taken.
Happy to answer any more questions as well here or you can email me, jad

I would definitely stray away from buying or selling over the counter due to the high risk of scams. This risk is highly prevalent when using services like Ebay and LocalBitcoins to buy and sell Bitcoin.

Thanks! We just had a brief chat about BitQuick and what we do; it was great to hear that he immediately recognized the necessity for a safer bitcoin trading marketplace. It was obvious to both of us that current platforms like LocalBitcoins are plagued with scammers.
Pretty exciting to have more validation :)

Hey plazman,
Give us a try:

We're the quickest service out there, we'd love to hear your feedback!
@_date: 2015-02-12 01:56:13
All correct except for the fact that we do not handle the cash. :) The cash still goes directly into the sellers account from the buyer.

Posted this in the other [Coinbase thread]( For the record, I think the heat towards Coinbase is a bit much. They're a fine company, but unfortunately they do have a pretty strict compliance program. It's a great place for people to start if they aren't concerned about waiting 3-5 days for their purchase to go through and want to use a bank transfer. 
For those who would rather pay in cash (sorry, we aren't anonymous, we collect ID for transactions above $400 or suspicious transactions):




* No meeting in person for trades, it's all done with cash deposit
* No bank account needed to buy
* **Only service that can guarantee BTC in your wallet from cash in your pocket in under 3 hours in the USA**
* No risk of being scammed - we got your back
* Holdings secured with BitGo multisignature wallets
* A [Boost.VC]( backed company

We **do not have an anti-privacy stance**. 
I do appreciate the strong feedback from the community, but want to also let you know we're all in the same boat here. We're all bitcoin enthusiasts trying to figure out the best way to drive mainstream adoption. For me, I envisioned a marketplace that newbies could go to and trade without worry of being scammed. You're still anonymous to other users, but ID's are kept on file to offer consumer protections so that criminals and other obvious bad players don't meddle in the market. In my opinion, that's how you get people like my mom and dad on board. Some people think different, and I surely don't fault them for that. We're all trying to get the same thing done.

You should try out [BitQuick!]( Our fee is 2%, but that is because we allow you to place a hold on an order, make payment, and receive your bitcoin, all in the SAME day! Payment is made via cash deposit, so transactions settle instantly. 
There's no extended verification process, and we only request ID for larger orders (even still, you will be able to complete our verification process in less than 5 minutes).
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:29:37
There's a general range that we do not disclose for security purposes, but to give a loose range, ID is typically automatically requested for orders over $500. 
thanks for the heads up, we'll be looking into this!

Funds confiscated for what? That would be the largest seizure in Bitcoin history. You are spreading irrational fears. Since when is FinCEN prosecuting owners of international Bitcoin exchanges? And do you really think BitQuick.co is as big as ThePirateBay? We aren't even as big as BTC-e...
And unethical? How in the world do you derive unethical from the situation unless you aren't a Bitcoin supporter?

Traffic definitely does fluctuate. We're working on big unique projects and it's providing waves of users. We are trying to get our price ticker up on Bitcoinity.org, and the admin has told us he is working on it. Our API is already set up. Hell, if anyone is curious:  filled buy orders
 for sell orders
We're also working on getting a Blog launched and having quality articles written on there about our development. We're really shooting for quality in everything we do. 
As for the donations, we appreciate the offer but we're getting enough money. Money isn't really too much an issue. We believe we have plenty of great ideas to push forth on, and no one involved in the project is greedy by any means haha. If you do want to send donations though (we have received a few before!) shoot us an email.

The info simply is not relevant though. All our support is efficiently handled via email. We're not trying to hide.
And there is certainly no reason to ever go scam. Going scam would assume we withdraw the funds in escrow from the sellers and attempt to disappear. First and foremost, that would destroy our reputation. Second of all, it makes more money to operate than for a one-day payday. From the buyers side, we can't even scam because buyers deposit the money into accounts owned by the sellers.
And just like any exchange, don't put more on than you would feel comfortable losing. Many of our sellers sell 0.1-0.5 BTC at a time and just refill their escrows. There are ways to mitigate risks and overall, once people use the BitQuick system, they love it. It's the easiest way to hit the Bitcoin market right now without having to go through hoops and loops.
@_date: 2013-10-05 16:27:50

Just because we aren't state of the art, there is no reason to throw around the word scam. Especially considering we've given outstanding customer service to all of our customers with zero complaints since launching.
Call us risky, fine. But don't call us scam. That's just disrespectful and hampers progress in the Bitcoin community.
At that, we keep all our private keys stored offline in cold wallets so I can guarantee you your Bitcoins are safer on BitQuick.co or BitQuick.in than they are on Mt. Gox, Coinbase, Bitfinex, CampBX or Bitstamp.
Also I'm assuming since you've been trading Forex for 5 years and only use reputable exchanges, then you probably don't trade Bitcoins at all. None of the exchanges are insured in the case your money gets stolen.

Hi everyone, official BitQuick.co reddit account here.
We do apologize for the lack of sell offers recently. You'll see pretty much all our coins got snagged up yesterday:

Thank you! There does seem to be a lot of confusion. But the system itself is quite ingenius. There's no Bitcoins that can be hacked/stolen because they're all stored in cold wallets offline. Even if the website were shut down, only the domain could be seized at worst. Just pop back up under a new domain :)

There is no catch! Its simply a great system. Why nobody didn't think of it first beats me but we're here to stay.
Volume on our website is around 50 btc per day but just last Monday we sold 122. 
We are also constantly doing work to grow the website.  We'll have our first developmental news blog post next week giving a brief overview of everything happening behind the scenes. 
Are there any specific questions I can address for you? We have a lot of sellers just selling a BTC or two at a time then filling another order.

Love to hear it :)
@_date: 2013-10-05 15:15:06
1. The rates are custom chosen by the seller. Then your order goes live and you wait for users to buy BTC from your order.
I think understanding the buy side will help iron out any confusion. Transfers of any kind other than SEPA for our EU buyers and sellers, are prohibited.
So to pay for a buy ordee of Bitcoin on BitQuick.co, the buyer goes to a a local branch of that sellers bank and directly deposits cold hard cash into the sellers account. 
Then the buyer emails his receipt to orders and we confirm with the seller if needed, and send the Bitcoin. This is why we have solved the USD withdrawal issue in an ingenious way by decentralizing the sellers user base.
2. Our largest purchase was for ~30 BTC and purchases above 10 are not uncommon.
3. We service all of EU via SEPA transfer and anywhere where banks allow customers to deposit cash at a local branch. We are extremely flexible because there is never a middle man for the FIAT exchange. The buyer directly pays the seller.
4. We aren't officially based out of anywhere at the moment since the entire system is virtual.
5. We are a very small group of individuals that know eachother personally. Trust is huge so we don't outsource anything. 
6. We were launched in late July as BuyBitcoin.US and rebranded to BitQuick.co August 10th, 2013

There is nothing wrong with encouraging good habits.
You can live that way, but then you're always at risk for something like Inputs.io happening, or even getting your account compromised on whichever exchange you use.
If you know how to manage your own private key, I would always recommend someone do that as opposed to trusting a website to store their Bitcoins for them.

Official BitQuick.co reddit account here, we are adopting this and will add the option to change the layout on our website from BTC to  mBTC and will use the symbol ₥ where ever ฿ is used.
We expect this to be implemented by the end of November. 
Let's hope others begin taking suit. The important thing is making the transition into mBTC from BTC. 
Exactly what we call it, the "mill" or a "milliBitcoin" or a "millicoin" isn't so much important because all of those make sense intuitively. What's more important is making the move to mBTC from BTC as a community as a whole.
We're starting.
@_date: 2013-10-01 15:54:34
We are an exchange, not a seller of Bitcoin.
That's where your confusion lies. When we sell 1 XBT, we're not really selling 1 XBT. The seller is selling 1 XBT, and we are giving 98% to the buyer, 1.5% for us and .5% to charity.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:56:32
Because we aren't trying to encourage using those methods of contact for support. That information is not easily found on most of the other exchanges as well. View Mt. Gox, Coinbase, and LocalBitcoins for example.
At that, the infrastructure that BitQuick provides allows us to be free from having a physical entity as we only directly interact with the Bitcoin network. Even if you view our system as risky, it only has risk from the seller side. Furthermore, you can personally mitigate that risk by not selling huge sums of BTC at once.
The platform can be utilized safely by buyers and sellers and is the easiest method to obtain and sell Bitcoins on the market today. Your other options are other exchanges that involve several steps of identity verification.
It's also important to note the distinction that we are more like a P2P exchange, like LocalBitcoins, than centralized exchanges such as Mt. Gox and Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-09-26 21:41:47
We have spoken with a lawyer regarding our business and it does not seem that registering would do much for us and the necessity for it is muddy at best. As it is, we do not touch any FIAT. We completely deal with BTC.
@_date: 2013-09-26 20:44:38
...How are they similar in any way other than the name and the fact that we are both fast?
We have no transaction limits, you pay anonymously and you pay in cold hard cash only.
Not to mention we aren't selling the Bitcoins, other users are. Its a decentralized P2P exchange.
Also I am not sure your higher volume claim is accurate. We're currently transacting ~60 BTC daily.
@_date: 2013-10-01 16:04:54

Hi there,
Your order in specific was placed on a JP Morgan Chase order. Considering you are outside of the united states, you cannot pay for this order. Cash deposit means you must physically go to that bank and deposit cash.
You should wait until a SEPA transfer orders pops up for sale and you can pay for those.
