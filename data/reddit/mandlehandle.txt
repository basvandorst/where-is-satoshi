so is this an indication of where alts' prices *should* be in theory?
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:39:56
if I'm hearing you correctly: now is an appropriate time to sell your entire position

the article provides no TA or evidence to support the claim in the title
the article does however ask for subscribers to this guy's page

my hunch is RH sells users emotional-trading metadata
metrics on when users panic-sell or FOMO-buy could be extremely useful data in the unregulated crypto market

will Bitcoin ever have another 'crypto winter' (like after the pop in 2013/14) though?
the asset should correct substantially in the short-term after doubling in price in about a month
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:21
but with the rest of the options large markets like coinbase keeps adding to their exchanges, how will the price of BTC withstand that redirection of capital (for the next impending cryptomarket-cap explosion)?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:43:53
there wasn't much price movement after the 2013/14 bubble

sounds like something Francisco D'Anconia would say

I’ve always wondered this myself, what if my long is to never have to liquidate to fiat?
@_date: 2018-10-16 21:43:51
did anyone else read that weird and sciencey, like “cryptocrancy”?

Invest now in my new startup enterprise-internet Blockchain protocol Bitcoin Brass!!!
It has no material innovations whatsoever, but gives investors the Bitcoin-backed brand name value without the catchy misleading buzzword suffixes 
There’s no white paper, just this comment
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:57:17
BTC didn’t break the psychological $4250 resistance (same resistance as around late December 2018)
So it dumped. It may or may not dump again
Next support post-recent-dump is ~$3600 +/-$50. If it holds, expect a break above $4250 within the coming weeks and say byebye to sub $4K BTC (my hunch would be push for/stabilization around $4800)
If the $3600 support breaks, BTC clearance sale for all

The market’s also very fractal over a given period of time. So all the tests/retests/general bouncing around can typically be explained by ever-exhausting fractal measurements

[I’ll oblige]( 
I am not claiming to know the future so everybody should invest like me. I’m not a big whale in the game. I’ve been watching the BTC charts ever since my first coinigy free trial ran out 
I’d like to think I have a good hunch when it comes to BTC volatility, sometimes I like to test it out 
Edit: please disregard the weird right angle squiggles
@_date: 2019-04-04 11:47:30
The market is extremely likely to move opposite of most people’s expectations in the short-term
*comparing the current charts with the 2015 winter may elucidate some interesting patterns*

thank you, Tide Pods ��

I assume a government would tax the utilities used for mining, instead
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:56:25
well, Allianz is using the blockchain framework **HyperLedger Fabric 1.0** to communicate the flow of data/$ between entities on the captive insurance policy renewal process
each participant of the captive program will have to integrate the framework into their operations, to allow for faster transmission of information 
at best, I believe this is just a trail-blazing venture that may set the precedent for all different types of insurance policies, premiums, claims and settlement to allow for insurance mechanisms to operate more smoothly with higher visibility 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:42:36
are you working on any cool projects you can let us in on?
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:33:18
well, I guess that question revolves around the paradigm of money in the future
I don't think a government can necessarily tax **BTC**, but I don't see why they wouldn't tax your net gain if you cashed out for **$$$**
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:31:28
can you elaborate? What do you do?

blockchain has some potential in the [insurance industry]( with regards to how Uber-large companies insure themselves to reduce their ***total cost of risk***
this can be done through the formation of a **captive** which is like a hybrid of a shell company and an insurance carrier who provides the parent company(s) insurance products, and can transfer risk away from the captive through a reinsurer 
often times, there are many more third-parties involved in the system besides just the reinsurer, such as the staff that run the captive, and, in some cases, a fronting insurer which fronts the captive the *paper* needed to place insurance
Allianz is thinking about implementing blockchain into a prototype captive insurance program to increase current liquidity and such

I imagine it's funny when professionals use HODL to mean Hold On for Dear Life. 
Even the most well-informed and educated are uncertain
