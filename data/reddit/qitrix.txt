My point exactly.
With your own example, coins from Schnorr could be seen as riskier, or more likely to come from criminal activity.
What about yourself? Would you rather recieve a freshly minted bitcoin from a coinbase tx  or one that has gone trough multiple mixing processes?

Segwit is not a privacy layer. It doesn't obscure the transaction history. It's just a way of packing multiple transactions into a block.
There are numerous examples of exchanges freezing your account because you received "tainted" coins though. Example:  [

Not just bitcoin btw. 
You will most likely be able to buy tickets with every coin listed on their new exchange.

The real Satoshi could easily prove his identity with a single transaction. Could even do it anonymously with an attached message.

Nothing specific. The desired protocol might not exist yet.
My argument is simply that opt-in privacy won't bring fungibility to bitcoin.

Oh he's on SOMETHING

That would add optional privacy. but wouldn't make bitcoin fungible. 
Bitcoin will never become truly fungible without a consensus change (hardfork).

And what if they get "hacked"

Coinswitch using the ol' HitBTC method to scam their costumers. 
Seems like a profitable scam these days.

Sure. but what value would remain for the investors?
It doesn't matter if they are liable for a trillion dollars if there is no value left in the company.
They might be able to track the bitcoins, but eventually it would be traded into Monero trough OTC or decentralized exchanges.

empty shelves. So i guess they sold out?
