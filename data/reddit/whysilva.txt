Your scenario is flawed, if someone breaks into a house there may not be a safe full of cash but there will be things of value. That’s going to be 95% of the reason anyone breaks into anything , crypto is just another form of value so literally your just worried about being robbed. In which case get a security camera and some guns. Just because crypto has the potential to be a thing of great value it’s no different than anything else with high value other than it’s actually harder to steal if stored properly.  Also nothing in the real world  is or should be “fool proof”. In life there are consequences for being stupid you either learn or go broke and die. A fool and his money are soon parted.

It’s because 90% of these exchange do not actually have they Crypto’s they claim. With no regulation and massively manipulated volumes it’s not on purpose attempts at obfuscation its them trying to actually scrape together your withdrawal.

If you have actually have over 3 million in fiat to invest and can prove it any major custodial exchange will probably send a cypher punk, lawyer, and accountant in a helicopter to do the transaction for you.

@_date: 2018-05-18 21:50:29
According to the articles “facts” its already invalid as we have already bounced over 8200 today, so what’s the “fact” based point of this article? Market cap goes up and down by 20 billion in a blink these days.

You could make desktop wallets on an old comp and not leave it hooked to the net, don’t leave your crypto’s in exchanges. If you truly feel these two exchanges are your best options then all you need to answer Is where you do you live? If Asia probably binance if USA or Europe then probably Coinbase good luck.
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:04:46
Did not say desktop, comp could be laptop raspberry pi, smart phone, smart watch etc. there are options depending on your level of  tech know how...

Short answer yes. There are lost coins easy to understand examples are coins sent to incorrect addresses or coins in wallets with lost keys.

If bitcoin fails “Blockchain”  goes with it, period saying anything else is not understanding what is truly revolutionary about the this whole space.

Side thought if your going from fiat to crypto through your bank account as often as it sounds and your account is linked to your parents, not sure on the tax codes where your at but you might want to check cause you could end up screwing up their taxes

Keep your cash outs below 10k fiat equivalent, at one time if you want to limit issues
