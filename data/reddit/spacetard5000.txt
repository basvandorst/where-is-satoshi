That's what I kept seeing on the top of the their sub when I'd peek in during June.  Haven't really payed as much attention to eth since it dropped and it's not what I'm set up to mine.  Google Russia Ethereum.

The thing that gets me about ethereum is all the accusations of centralization while the "good news" posted about its development being picked up usually links back to Russia's oligarchy,ie tests by Russian banks, Russian industry, butters meeting with Putin.

Yup. Why would Russia want to back out of the dollar? Oh yeah that's right Putin and Co had their assets frozen in America and giving America Trump didn't fix that.  Not that Russia is actually going to back out of the dollar yet.  Putin wants that money back it's just too much to be left on the table.

I wonder who buys used miners instead of waiting a month or two for the next batch.  Granted I wouldn't buy a s9 in any case because the competition with the big Chinese miners leaves almost no real profits anymore.  Now the L3+ on the other hand...

Maybe he has a stock of miners for people to buy at scalpers prices?  Could be wrong but that's what it sounds like to me.   Frankly I detest scalpers jacking up to costs of hardware be it miners or gpus.
