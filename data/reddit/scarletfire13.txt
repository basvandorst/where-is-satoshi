So if I use square for my business in California, can I accept Bitcoin with it now?
@_date: 2018-06-19 00:43:45
Well I guess if anyone here likes cool crystal specimens, you know who takes Bitcoin ;p

If you think I'm serious about the paid troll shit lol. The market is in a shitty place just will make the good days even sweeter.  The coin I'm mostly invested in is actually doing alright despite the bloodbath.  I mean relative to what good is right now lol
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:19:50
haha, I wonder why he got banned.
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:23:35
Make sure you wash your hands.

Btw I'm a redditor for over 6 months so I have extra troll credit. Idk why it says 3? I just saw other people being accused of being paid trolls and thought hey,  I'll put in my resume.

I'm semi concerned about the guy who said he'd eat his own dick if it hit 11k two days ago. He's usually a frequent poster, haven't seen him at all since. Either he's hiding for fear we will hodl him to his bet, or he did it and he bled out.... 
@_date: 2018-03-12 05:57:22
Like the argument but I find your use of "ain't" distracting. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:30:52
Backed out of that whole god thing ahwile back but may Jerry Garcia grant us a miracle so we can stand on the moon. Lol
@_date: 2018-03-05 21:14:52
this feels like de ja vu.
@_date: 2018-03-02 16:30:15
Hey so did anyone watch that live stream from yesterday? I must've missed it and I don't see him, hoping he didn't bleed out from the bet, that or he is hiding.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:18:51
Anyone else see the glitch to 58000 lol.

So setting the course for Uranus is an overshot?
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:27:39
Yeah, but then the next day he made the same bet, and it did, then he disappeared.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:31:09
So it just broke 11k....
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:29:50
Okay but now Marijuana is legal in California so. And also the alleged crime never actually happened so why are they trying so hard to stick him with a conviction for this, seems a lot like grasping for straws and entrapment.

I prefer to say Uranus's Moon.

Well that's a relief, I was worried you chopped it off before you used it, which I suppose is still of high probability.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:23:40
Probably shouldn't have made the same bet two days in a row, unless you were planning on gender reassignment surgery anyway, in that case, great foresight!

I don't agree with you that court appointed lawyers are all decent. It depends. A lot of court appointed lawywers are buddy buddy with the district attorney so they can work their way up in the world. They will try to get you to take whatever deals the DA wants if they are corrupt like this.

Can anyone explain to me why on coinbase, when you go to buy and sell, no matter what the price of the coin, it is always 50-100 higher to buy it, and 50- 100 lower to sell? ( ie. price is at 8500, to buy its 8580, to sell its 8420) Am I misunderstanding the interworkings of it by thinking that seems scammish? I tried asking them and got no response, so figured I'd consult the "experts" ;P. Sorry if this has already been posed and answered a million times over.

Curious to know when numbers like 666 show up does anyone get excited or panic sell. I personally get excited, not just when 666 shows but other numbers too. It would be cool to study the frequency of numbers with certain symbology behind them affect the movements.

Not guarenteed, but generally it goes up friday and saturday, then dips sunday. But like I said I could be wrong, its not really predictable, if some crazy good news comes out it could shoot up, you just never know.

I thought I saw someone else saying this but wasn't sure if it was in reference to the same question I had, thank you for the response, now I understand. Can you place a limit order on coinbase/how?
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:30:04
Anyone else regretting not buying more at 10.2-10.3 yesterday? Had so many opportunities...

That's what I assumed but I wasn't sure...And that's on top of the fees they apply to transactions.... I should've researched more I suppose but I was having trouble getting other sites to work on my shit computer.

You know they have to dumb it down for folks, calling it a protocol kind of whisks over a lot of peoples heads I think. I'm on the fence about whether investment is the right term to describe it, I think it needs a lot more explanation than that.
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:47:45
This followed by her checking the price and consequently beating him for not buying the dip.

I know the number $1,000,000 by 2020 sounds awesome but is anyone else hoping it just grazes like $999,999 by 2020 so McAfee has to eat his dick.

Couldn't he have assumed that the dude had sold it legally, seeing as there are quite a few states who are recreationally legal, not to mention states that have been medical for years, California since 96 I believe. We've heard news about these high grossing markets in Colorado and what not.... like I said this seems like a far reach for feds. Don't they have better stuff to be doing.

Why would they kill one of their best puppets yet? The only reason they would do that at this point would be advance some form of gun control. The average American  understands that killing people is wrong, just because some kids get brainwashed into killing and dying for our "freedom" doesn't mean we're all prone to violence...As much as I pray the Simpsons predicted it once again, only time will tell. An aneurism would be such a blessing

A lot of us don't support our wars of terror. Like I said, brainwashing impoverished young men into dying to protect pipelines and poppies is wrong. Youre right the prison/police state is fucked here. You have to realize these things aren't necessarily approved by the people though the big cheeses that run everything might want to portray it that way. People are losing faith in the system while others ignore it and continue to consume... Its easy to distrsct and Set us against each other on issues. Divide and conquer. Shits rigged.

I sell crystal specimens, mostly in a music festival setting, but I also live near silicon valley, I think my customer base might have a decent percentage of crypto users, and my father is a hodler for a few years now, I'm a more recently onto the scene but am enthusiastic and really want to incorporate it into my business. What info do I need to have ready to offer crypto payments into my current account or do I need to have a shopify to do so?

Bear claws.
@_date: 2018-04-05 08:04:55
So I'd just give them my wallet address if it were in person, but I'd have to have bitpay etc. Or would any of the platforms work? Ie: coinbase, gdax etc.
@_date: 2018-04-01 07:40:57
Don't worry, according to the Simpsons it will be so. Also, he's been a good puppet, no need for any govt agencies to take him out yet. Most Americans genuinely believe killing people is wrong. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 16:55:33
So wonderful you are doing that for her. I  have a gem and mineral shop and Ido have a 5 inch quartz crystal ball, never used so no bad juju or whatever. Its beautiful. You've actually just sparked an idea that I cannot believe it didn't occur to me already, that my business should accept crypto. So thank you, I have three daughters and I'm working on doing the same for them soon, I've been building up to it though.
