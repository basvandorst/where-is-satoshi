And that shit is going to get much worse- the BTC futures trading they announced is an instrument to manipulate the price of bitcoin. Downwards. Into oblivion.
We are going to have to fight the real dragons now.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:41:12
That's irrelevant in relation to the first factors listed.
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:33:02
FAKE BOT! FAKE LYESING BOTSES!
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:27:19
And the value of those things?

If he could just go ahead and give us the chart by the end of the week that would be greeeeeeeeeat.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:36:32
How did you do that?

Time to buy a new girlfriend!

I buy bitcoin with my fiat salary. That salary came from my boss, who doubtlessly borrowed money from a bank to get it started.
Does that mean that I am investing bank debt into BTC? That would be cool.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:24:04
Ooooooooh snap, that's a brilliant thought! What would you name the parties? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:09:02
Well said.

Go chomp on a womp rat, Yoda.

"Titles"? "Titles"!? "TITLES"?!?
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:14:04
That will *never* get old.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:43:27
Could you, or someone else, please explain to me how to math a problem such as this, because it's driving me crazy:
How much USD would I have to invest in BTC to be able to live off the returns given a projected increase in BTC value of 15% a year and living expenses at $2K per month?
I would be very happy for A) the answer to the question, and B) an explanation of how to think of it in math that makes sense, because I really don't know what to google for...
Very much obliged, thank you and please.

Thereby undermining bitcoin.
If you were so inclined.

When it becomes a threat the governmental bodies have a way of shutting the whole thing down.

Tulips are pretty. Bitcoin is a currency. It has uses flowers don't.

Society came about as a result of human cooperation. Our current society is based strictly on competition.

Wow that's a short book!

Game theory does not explain human motivation, nor does it dictate it. We have free will to choose.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:28:40
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:34:02
Wow, that's the official line? Because if so then it's an extremely weak argument for it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:19:54
We're going there in fucking space lambos!

It's ok, he is alive, because people don't die as a result of you misreading headlines.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:32:44
Awesome! Thanks a lot for helping a math moron out, I could actually follow along and understand that. Thanks!
Edit: Also, that's doable. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:21:53
Does n have any relation to the mathematics of fractals? I mean, like calculating a coastline where it gets longer the closer you measure?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:47:43
Yeah 10k is probably this year.

Patience is engraved into the Chinese soul. They will just wait for the bamboo to grow so tall it'll snap, or some wise allegory like that.

What this dude said. I'm on board the fucking spaceship.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:20:21
Well, I mean it runs the Universe, so...
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:42:01
That's oddly specific...

Dollars derive pretty much their whole value from the fact that all oil trade in the world has to be traded with them since the 1971 and 1973 OPEC agreements.
Oil is going, the dollar is going, an the United States, FINALLY, is going, along with its never-ending wars for oil. Maybe one day the rest of the world can have peace when you are gone.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:13:04
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:03:08
And what is the value of the thing it pays for?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:15:51
The only thing that scares me about this all is that if BTC ever becomes the dominant currency, or even A dominant one, is the absurd concentration of power it would bring.
It's really not a good thing when single individuals wield extreme power with no accountability whatsoever.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:41:33
To become poor? WHY?!
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:12:58
I mean, if that happens, wouldn't we all be fucked either way? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:37:15
I'm don't think that's right but I don't know enough about math to dispute you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:02:40
I would love to read about that! Could you point me in the right direction? Russell wrote so much...
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:36:59
I had no idea, I'm from Europe and don't use Coinbase at all, it was just the first name that popped into my head. The power of PR, I suppose.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:44:39
Well if that's what everybody thinks and everybody knows that that's what everybody thinks then people will sell before the fork, causing the price to drop at that time instead wouldn't they?
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:02:21
They are getting on board so that they can sink the ship. This hit me like a ton of bricks right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:25:25
We should Annexit.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:38:40
Look, you can buy any amount you want. You can buy $0.1 worth of it if you want.
Simplest way would probably be to head over to Coinbase.com, make an account, deposit USD, and buy BTC. Done.
Then hodl.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:50:25
Is there a good YouTube video explaining this? I have a hard time keeping up.
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:24:56
SPACE lambo!
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:29:36
I would like to take this opportunity and say: Hodl on to your grandmas! This rocket's taking off!

A billion times this. My funds were frozen on KuCoin for over 6 months, due to, uh, no reason whatsoever. Never got an explanation or anything. Just "lol nope".

It began over a hundred years ago. They already have most of it.

When it dies, we die with it. There will be no magic transition period into better and more fair alternatives- when the vaults come crashing down we will be buried in the rubble. It will be the Dark Ages 2.0, and honestly, I'm beginning to think that such a thousand year hiatus from capitalism is the only hope we have to survive as a species on this planet.
Vast, vast numbers of people will die, life will be brutal, nasty, and short, but it will be another chance for us to keep civilization going. In a millennium.
