It's a bit *"roll-your-own"* and perhaps not yet for the masses, but CSipSimple (on Android) or Jitsi (on Win / Lin) used with your choice of VoIP provider e.g.  getonsip.com (for simplicity) or ostel.co (for the paranoid) or any of literally dozens of other carriers (great for local dial in and great rates on dial out to the PSTN) makes for a very workable, can-be-secure solution.

True, but for most UK users, international bank transfers are expensive and have a poor exchange rate, as well as taking a couple of days or more. It's probably worth while for trading large amounts, but as many threads in this sub show; a lot of people just want a cheap &amp; quick fix.

The option to paste a seed in hexadecimal was removed from the Electrum GUI -- presumably because of the risk of people trying to be smart but failing, and ending up with less secure wallets. 
AFAIK the option still exists in the console, but if you really aren't sure what's meant by "converting a &gt;10 word seed to hex"  there's absolutely no need to seek it out. Just trust the 128 bit seed and the 12 word mnemonic that electrum gives you, you'll be much safer.... but you asked for an explanation - I'll try to keep it simple:
Various algorithms exists to calculate a hash of any given input (in the case the randomly generated pass phrase), such that a) it will always be exactly the same if the input is unchanged, and b) is highly unlikely to produce the same hash for a different input. Even a single space or . will alter the hash significantly. The hash is written as a string of hex digits - how many depends on the algorithm used. e.g. the sha256sum hash of "*Can you explain what you mean by convert to hex to use as electrums seed?*" is 
      748d86d2950b01e0404f88059d676034e9d3e0f2a2a80a146f1501d7281d6a5f
Simply removing the "*?*" gives: 
      98379be4afb3d722a9c2b787eeda7988f074c2bfeb8ac9ed718e2f510f193c04
for comparison, the sha256sum of "*a*" is: 
      ca978112ca1bbdcafac231b39a23dc4da786eff8147c4e72b9807785afee48bb
Cryptography works because the same hash can always be derived from a given input, but the input can not be derived from the hash.
To the human eye, they all look like a nice long hard to guess password, so you might be tempted to use any of those as a seed for electrum but that would be a really bad idea and almost certainly lead to the loss of your bitcoin. The true randomness and the amount of entropy generated are the important factors in securing your wallet.

Nice subtle promo for your deal on the paperwallet kit, but unfortunately the term "hooked" already has rather negative connotations for the recipient, (e.g fish get hooked - bad for the fish, smack addict gets hooked - pleasant feeling, but bad outcome eventually, etc.) 
Since we believe bitcoin to be ultimately beneficial to the world in general, it would be better to get folk enthusiastic about it, without the use of language that has these negative connotations which may reinforce the kind of scam / ponzi accusations we already have to overcome.

[Diceware]( is a good method to generate random pass phrases. You need ten words from their list of 7776 for the same 128 bit entropy that Electrum gives, and you can go higher if you're really paranoid.
You'll need to convert it to Hex to use as Electrums seed, but probably the safest method if you really want a brainwallet.

Hey, thank you for a sensible response. Could just be another case of language evolving, but seeing "get them hooked" just felt a bit too insidious to let it pass without mention.

Explain why your search for bitcoin in published standards finds nothing? Because there isn't a published standard that mentions bitcoin yet.
However there is [ISO4217]( can buy the whole thing for 140 Swiss Francs) that defines the standard for international currency codes which are  in turn based on *"ISO3166 which lists the codes for country names. The first two letters of the ISO 4217 three-letter code are the same as the code for the country name, and where possible the third letter corresponds to the first letter of the currency name."*  
Since 1974 `bt` has been the country code for Bhutan, hence BTC for bitcoin is incompatible with the standard that defines currency codes. Since Bitcoin doesn't have a suitable country code, the standard dictates that it should start with an X as does Gold (XAU), Silver (XAG) and various other entities used internationally.
You're right in that XBT hasn't yet been rattified but it does have a certian following with the likes of Bloomberg, XE etc. I also agree that Bloomberg *et al* don't get the final say, but nor do you. I don't always agree with  ISO standards, but I've spent enough of my life working with them to anticipate your disappointment that BTC won't be official no matter how often we use it in the real world. No reason it can't exist like that though - there are other non-official codes too. [ for more info. Personally I think XBT is a bit short sighted as there will likely be other crypto-currencies in future, so perhaps something line XCB would work with the C standing for *Cryptographic* and the B for *bitcoin* leaving 25 other possibilities for any current or future alt-coins. I guess we'll have to wait and see.

Depending how many special characters are available to be chosen, a 30 character password has an entropy of between 178 - 195 bits. Pretty strong but hard to remember. 
14 to 16 words chosen properly using the [Diceware]( method and word-list gives greater entropy (180 - 206 bits respectively) and is easier to remember / conceal. Only 10 words from that list gives &gt;128 bits of entropy  - widely regarded as more than adequate.

Frankly there are bigger problems here. Outside of the main population areas basic infrastructure is one of the biggest hurdles - e.g about 20 mins ago, the power came back on for the first time in over 24 hours. The generator ran out of diesel yesterday afternoon, and the battery / inverter died last night. I'm not complaining though - a few Km up the road they don't even have running water. Not being able to take these things for granted puts a lot of barriers in the way of even being able to learn about bitcoin, let alone how to use it safely. Having said that, I'm still trying to help some locals get to grips with it, and hope to help them accept it online in the near future.
So it's gonna be a long slow process... meanwhile keep sowing the seeds - asking if people accept it, setting folk up with android or paper wallets etc.
