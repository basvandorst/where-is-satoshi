Anonymity is a must, in my opinion. As soon as there is a digital currency that offers anonymity, it will take away the ability to apply pressure. Then the states can circlejerk endlessly on how they don't like it, but they won't be able to do anything about it without attacking the internet itself (which they're poised to do).
Unfortunately BTC is now almost exclusively a tool to move finances where people have been prevented for a long time. I hope that eventually, maybe after that cat is totally out of the bag, people will not see BTC as a way of transferring wealth, but a medium of exchange directly to whatever product or service they need. Right now it's a pressure release, and there has been a lot of pressure built up.
It's the exchanging to/from BTC that is a problem that isn't inherent in BTC itself, and where the banks/states will be a pain in the ass. BTC is just so volatile at this stage that most people aren't willing to accept BTC aside from it's exchange-ability to their local legal tender.
The US dollar will continue to be devalued, and when perception turns against it... being that it's the world's reserve currency, this will cause perceived/actual value to drop across the board, except for the commodities like gold, &amp; silver, and then not only should BTC rise in value... but when the local devalued currency become so terrible, I think we'll see people happy to stay in BTCs, and not look to transfer to another plummeting official currency. This may have the effect of BTC being a currency for the individuals, and small businesses, and not something accepted at Walmart (which isn't necessary).
