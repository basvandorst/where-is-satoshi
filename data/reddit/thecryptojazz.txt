You can’t compare bitcoin with the current, dated monetary system. It defies any rules you are already familiar with, and that is the point. The point is to decentralize money. Give control back to the people, and shed oneself from corporate and government control. 
Sounds dramatic but a group of people saw what the banking system was doing for years which eventually resulted in the GFC, yes the GLOBAL financial crisis and decided to do something about that corporate and government greed. They created a decentralized, global currency, one with a finite supply and a public, trusted ledger. When you put the puzzle pieces together you will understand why Bitcoin was created and what Bitcoins value is. 
10 years later what we see is something different and perhaps the original intention has been skewed. Bitcoin has been hijacked to some degree, by the very people it intended to make obsolete, but the original use case is still there, so if you believe in it, then use it!
Adoption is coming in some form or another. It isn’t going away because people like me believe in it and are fed up with power and greed. 
I’m 29 by the way, I don’t own a home, my family was low income and had nothing to “pass on”.  I have no formal education and I work a full time job for pennies. That may help you understand my point of view and that of many others.
Perhaps we will see stability as distribution spreads but I’m not gonna pretend to understand how billion dollar markets work. I don’t trade. I HODL.

I believe how the tech works, sure. I believe in decentralized value transfer and its ability to give me freedom. Sure. Does that change Bitcoins speculative price and create fluctuations? Sure. 
Are there Fiat whales who wield supreme control over your life? Sure. 
As for “Failsafes”?! Haha they just repackaged the same shit and gave it a different name. It’s still happening, the system which created the GFC is still “full
Steam ahead!” Oh and it helps if you can just keep
printing money, creating fake industries and fake profits. At some point the ivory tower will fall.

His address didn’t change because it took hours, he’s just trying to double dip. Scam. As long as you sent the bitcoin to the address he originally gave you and that is visible in the TXID then just tell him to piss off.

How much did this setup cost? And when did you buy majority of it?
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:17:26
A correction was always bound to happen, god this last month has been insane across the board. It’s gearing up for 2018, but some profits had to be taken. The world still operates in fiat. 
The smarties took out their initial investments, the traders made bank, the hodlers well... hodl’d and the noobs lost money. 
There is definitely something disheartening with the whole Btrash/Bitcoin scenario (downvotes for Btrash!)
And 100% it affected the current state of the market. 
There is ultimate greed and power at play here.  These are guys who 10’years ago were like you and me, they wanted a better, fairer world and had the foresight to invest in an incredible opportunity.. and now look at them. No better then the bankers they once despised. 
Just keep believing in the tech and be smart with your money guys.

Fiat whales are doing the same thing but in trillion dollar markets so the ripple effect is less noticeable but trust me, they’re also making a “quick buck”

Your aren’t the only one, I can’t stop finding ways to make more money so I can buy crypto. It’s priority number 1 �� l

You guys never stop promoting your scam exchange �� haha

How specific does your dollar predication have to be?
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:40:04
Your buying paper BTC on Robinhood. You can’t actually withdraw or spend BTC.
@_date: 2019-02-27 22:06:36
Call JP Morgan, they’d probably put it in The lobby ha! I don’t know man. All I would do is try speak to a few local business’ and hopefully find someone who’s sympathetic/ awesome and see if you could loan some wall space �� 
What about galleries? If you were in Aus I could probably hook that up 
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:01:27
This the same dude who posted a pic of himself with a Lambo?

Can someone outline and eli5 what I need to do to run a node/ lightning node?
@_date: 2019-06-19 11:27:06
Don’t be fooled either, BCH is not Bitcoin. Buy BTC
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:07:54
Holy shit this is cool! What did you use?Paint? Ink? Etc 
Especially love ‘Loss Vegas’ haha 
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:47:48
Does how accurately you predict then determine your payout? Relative to your original bet of course.
@_date: 2019-06-20 01:20:05
‘You’ll never get your money out!’
Edit: I then proceeded to transfer $15 worth to the exchange, market sold and withdrew to my bank account which all took a total of 3 minutes in its entirety, money in my account and all!. Felt good debunking that one.
@_date: 2019-06-30 08:38:54
It’s simple man, just wait until your in the green and sell when you feel comfortable. You may miss a few hundred (thousand?)in gains, or you might time it perfect. The one thing to NEVER do is SELL AT A LOSS. Just HODL if in red.

Risky business getting your ‘boss’ involved lol
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:47:05
Be prepared to answer some hard questions if prices slump or they don’t cash out. My old boss insisted I set up a wallet and purchase LTC at its ATH for him after seeing my stupid gains. Admittedly I was confident it would hit 1k and well we all know what happened... I ended up leaving my job mid bull run, and mid 2018 I got several calls from him, which naturally I didn’t answer haha ��
I think this time round we are still early days so fingers crossed, but be sure to explain the risks involved.
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:14:56
Good strategy! Haha
@_date: 2019-02-27 21:40:11
Very cool,  maybe try  some well known bitcoin enthusiasts on twitter? I’m sure they’d see this and shout it out / appreciate the work, even Joe Rogan would probably praise this publicly if you tagged him, he generally gives credit when credit is due. If you manage that then I’m sure you’ll find a home for it!
Good luck 
@_date: 2019-06-23 06:38:38
It’s Tether printing fake money to buy/pump bitcoin then selling back their bags for real/fomo money, thus creating cash out of thin air to fill up their non existent ‘reserves’.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:38:33
Time to sell
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:53:08
Hope so
@_date: 2019-06-16 09:39:21
By the end of 2017 I was checking prices several times an hour and basically about to give up my job as a carpenter.  My 40 year old boss who was tech illiterate wasn’t even mad because the FOMO had taken over! He convinced me to help him set up a Coinbase account and he bought 2 LTC for $1000(including fees). It was the absolute peak. I should have known to sell at this moment lol
EDIT: $1000 AUD

I have had this happen several times and absolutely loath the eBay/PayPal combo. It’s the most backwards system.
@_date: 2019-05-29 11:52:04
Told all my mates to buy at $4900(AUD) and they shrugged me off. I bought.  5 months later, NOW they buy lol ��

It’s actually a lot easier to predict if you just take control of your emotions. Think long term and gather information from multiple sources. When you read articles shilling the fuck out of crypto go and read more critical analysis and try to develop an unbiased opinion. Both sides of the fence have valid arguments. 
Disclaimer* I’m a noob and don’t know anything but... 
I bought in a few thousand dollars worth back in September 2017 and managed to sell all of my holdings by Feb 2018. 
I read a lot and realised the down trend whilst many were still praying for 50k bitcoin. 
I held tight through 2018 and only just bought back in 2 weeks ago. 
I made money in feb and had the self discipline to not spend a cent until now NOT because I know the first thing about trading or financial analysis but because I read both sides of the story consistently, on a daily basis and I do this to gather a better idea of what’s going on within the market. 
All I would say is use your head.
@_date: 2019-05-14 08:12:30
Me and my bro were going to buy mining gear when it was about $250 in 2013 but the bank wouldn’t lend me the $5k I wanted. In hindsight I should have just bought some bitcoin then. Ended up getting in early 2017.
