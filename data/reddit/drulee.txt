For German BTC exchanges like [bitcoin.de]( have a look at its [imprint]( You see the *Court of Registration* and the *Handelsregister*.
With the following websites: [site1]( [site2]( [site3]( you can find information about:
* When was the company founded, what is its share capital, who was its founder, when was he born, was the company renamed or bought, get all the historic data
* The comany's annual balance sheet. Usually 1-2 years belated.

Well I could not believe it myself, but double checked it. Here is a [screenshot](
I send Euro via bank transfer to WU, the artist gets RSD in cash at a WU local office.
For 100€ the Serbian gets 11470 RSD instead of 11570 RSD (current exchange rate reported by WolframAlpha and Google), that's why it's not 0% fee, but the amount I calculated.
Fee becomes way higher, when you use credit cards.
Edit: Still actually do not believe what is written in the calculator on the WU website. Haha... Well, I will see what will be the fee in fact... I'll report here.

I think for me it sounded more like he wanted to express that Dorian could have written the code, but **obviously he hasn't** because the code is not his style, as it is spaghetti code which needs to be restructured etc.
He says that newsweek chose him because Dorian has only the profile to be creator of BTC and that newsweek apparently failed in searching for the creator of BTC and he states that **one does not simply find people by checking their characteristics** (dragnet investigation).

Great that you feel this excitement! You could help in many ways, depending on your ambitions and skills:
* Tell your family, friends and everyone you want to about BTC.
* Read news about bitcoin and post new articles or write something yourself in r/bitcoin
* Read the [bitcoin wiki]( and the [normal wikipedia article]( to understand how it works. Update the articles.
* If you are a programmer, help the project on [github]( or build BTC plugins for web shops or participate at other projects
* If you are a web developer, consider integrating BTC payment methods
* Make a list of the BTC advantages and try to convince shop plugin creators or web shop developers to make BTC payment available. Find out how to make BTC payment available in "offline" shops and convince them.
* Trade, e.g. at the BTC exchanges (except for Mt.Gox) or at localbitcoins.com
* Get some BTC, spend some BTC for something useful for you. Maybe donate some BTC. 
* Try out BTC ATMs and give feedback to the developers.
* Ask journalists, newspapers, blogs to write about BTC.
* Convince people of BTC's advantage. Learn BTC's disadvantages and try to find ways to fix them.
* Join BTC meetups, BTC forums, r/bitcoin and the other BTC subreddits you are interested at, maybe create your own BTC club
* What does the world need? Or your town? Or some merchant, business man or shop owner? How can BTC improve those people's and companies' situations? Make your own innovative BTC project and find guys to team up with.

Nice project, wish you good luck!
Btw from a technical point of view, the Android app is at 16k, the web app at 24k and the iOS app at 38k Euro. I am not too familiar with mobile app development, but since you plan to release apps on all platforms, why not make one single web app instead and build it with Phonegap to make it available on all your desired platforms then? Wouldn't that be cheaper? Maybe your background as an Android developer makes you prefer native apps, but have you considered the Phonegap app anyway?

Never used it, but maybe on  customers can buy bitcoins via credit card instantly without registration. [Here]( in the forum they say they provide an API so your customers use dollars while you receive bitcoins.
But it sounds easier for me if you
 * let customers who already own bitcoins pay with bitcoins
 * let customers who don't understand how to buy bitcoins pay with paypal.
Why don't you let them pay with SEPA? Does it need to much time? Or are you outside EU while your customers are in Europe?

Not sure, what is her website hoster? Looks like you get redirected to perfora.net/westbrookscannery.com/shop/ when shopping. Thus it could belong to 1and1.com. They offer different ecommerce solutions:

Bitcoin.de if you live in the EU or in Switzerland.
* Seems very legit: Imprint points to a company in Germany, which can be checked on [bundesanzeiger.de]( Cooperation with a [bank]( from Munich/Germany.
* They had a fast reaction regarding the transaction malleability and have a blog ([de]( which is always kept up to date.
* You interact directly with the users via SEPA transactions, e.g. when you sell BTC for €, you get the money directly from the users.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:13:31
So, I emailed them. Verification is still needed to withdraw. OK, that's alright, but:
Total **fee to withdraw RSD is 6.5%**.
Thought the low fee was an advantage of BTC. Doesn't apply here. Not gonna do it that way. I'm pretty disappointed.
Edit: Want to do two transactions, 1st about 100€, 2nd about 130€. Here is a comparison of money transfer fees from Germany to Serbia:
* 1) Deposit Euros: 0€, Sofortüberweisung.de
* 2) Send money: 1.0%, maximum of 10€
* 3) Receive money: 0€
* 4) Withdraw money: Bank transfer 2.95€
* Total for 100€ + 130€: 1€+2.95€ + 1.3€+2.95€ = **8.20€ total**
* 1) Receive BTC + Withdraw money: 6.5%
* Total for 100€ + 130€: 6.5€ + 8.45€ = **14.95€ total**
Western Union:
* Total for 100€ + 130€ (Send € by bank transfer and receive RSD cash): ~~0.86€ + 1.1€ = **1.96€ total**~~ Edit: I don't know how much fees for withdrawing RSD. The Serbian got asked whether to withdraw RSD or €. Chose €, received the exact amount of € I've sent, **no fees**.
* Total for 100€ + 130€ (Send € by bank transfer and receive € cash): **0€ total**
Bank transfer (depends on the bank of course):
* 1) Send money: 19.95€
* Total for 100€ + 130€: 19.95€ * 2 = **39.90€ total**

* They had a fast reaction regarding the transaction malleability and have a blog (de/en) which is kept up to date.

Good idea, and let's collect some information here before writing the letters.
1) What are the main advantages for the company to accept BTC?
* small fees (about 0.05$, maybe only 0.005$ soon)
* payment could become less complicated than Deutsche Bahn booking
* worldwide fast transactions ([instantaneously in only a few seconds via bitpay](
* open protocol, support from the community
* highly secured transactions through encryption
* transactions are irreversible!
* **unique selling point** for the bus company which adopts bitcoin the first. e.g. easy to advertise in the BTC communities.
2) How would you do the implementation of accepting BTC? (Maybe if you already have ideas about it, it will seem easier to implement then)
* Maybe [BitPay]( I don't know, never worked with it.

The only strange find I had in the *mtgox_balances* file were some
* Extremely high *Balance*s up to [4 trillion BTC]( and up to [257 billion US$]( each in a single *User_Wallet__*.
* Negative *Balance*s in *User_Wallet__*s: Up to -199 million $ and up to -8 billion BTC ([image](
I don't know what kind of accounting that is.
Edit: Silly me. Assuming the BTC amount is in Satoshi and the US$ in US$ cents, we have:
* 44548 BTC at maximum in a wallet
* **2.57 billion US$ at maximum in a wallet** - still pretty much.
* up to -1.99 million US$ and -85 BTC at minimum in a wallet

* 48.000 Intel Xeon Phi 31S1P with about [20 GH/s each]( = about 960 TH/s
* **in total**: not even 1 Petahash/s or 1 BTC every 10 minutes
* Costs of [390 million US$ once and 17.6 MW power consumption](
* Hardware break even: &gt; 10000 days

So, I've sent 100€ by WU, Serbian could choose whether to withdraw € or RSD, chose €, and received exactly 100€. Absolutely **no fees**.
The only trick is: Initiate the WU transfer online, transfer the money not by credit card, but by instant bank transfer to WU (in Germany we have sofortüberweisung.de for this). And maybe withdraw in the same currency you've sent to avoid a bad exchange rate. But can't say how good or bad the rate is.
