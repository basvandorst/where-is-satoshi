At my office, Becky was selling candy for a fundraiser. John asked her, "Do you accept cash?" So, I replied, "No John, pay her in Bitcoin."

This is the expected behaviour of futures upon introduction to the market. Going forward, futures will bring bitcoin up. Look at the history of s&amp;p 500.

This is so wrong, we either never reaach it, or reach it by the end of the week. Look at the weekly MACD and RSI

The probability of my guess is a lot higher.

Is this post a trigger for the biggest bitcoin crash ever. Atay tuned for the next reason bitcoin will crash.

This is up to 2013. How does it look now?

I think these results are pretty close to reality.

There is no catch. You are just sending $80.

To be fair. He is taking the right steps to evaluate bitcoin. He just hasn't completed his research. 
At first, I was also heavily criticizing bitcoin. I thought that it's a byproduct (garbage) produced by computing power  (proof of work). Therefore, it led me to believe that the only thing that gives it value, is speculation. I didn't think it had much intrinsic value.
Then, I truly grasped what blockchain technology really means. The public ledger alone, is enough to justify bitcoin as a legitimate currency and give it intrinsic value. Then , the limited supply allows for proper valuation of bitcoin's exchange rate.
It comes down to whether or not one believes in blockchain technology. It is obvious that this author doesn't understand the uses of this technology, and therefore he disregards it's value.

Those things are not a waste. Those are the things that money was made for.

Well, at this point we are talking about use cases.
I agree that it isn't used much as money to pay for goods or services.
But there are couple of other uses:
1. Store of USD value.
2. International money transfer.
3. Money laundering and pseudonimity.
4. Investment, speculation or a hedge.
These are all use cases and this is why bitcoin has value.
In my opinion, it isn't used much as money, because currently fiat currency still works better for that.

Yes. This is a time value of money formula. Thanks. How about the interest rate. Where can I find historical data?
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:21:01
Yea, the argument in this post is irrelavant. It doesn't matter if it's used as money or not. Blockchain is proof that its being used.
The first guy doesn't understand that bitcoin is different tyoe of money.
The second guy doesn't understand that the first guy wants more real world adoption.
Or they know but are just trying to piss each other off.

Did you make this yourself? I would love  a link to a dynamic table like this. Lmk.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:56:19
Thanks. Might do my own calculations based on this.

Is it gonna bounce today?
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:11:02
Lets do this!

Maybe future contract?

I agree that bitcoin is a solution for Venezuelans, but I want to add that bitcoin is complex. It's anti-dollar, so it also depends on USD. So, I think Venezuelens use BTC more as a store of USD value, rather than an alternative currency. 
Please correct me if Venezuelens actually value things in BTC amounts, because that  would mean that bitcoin is finally truly independent. It would also mean that it's actually working as a currency.

Do people actually make more money gold farming in popular MMOs than they would working a job?
This is somewhat bitcoin related, as I imagine they would sell the gold for btc.

The current market fluctuation is technical and is simply a result of supply and demand. Other than that, you are absolutely right.
