Another pump and dump?
@_date: 2014-11-22 01:51:39
Coinkite just announced their implementation of m-of-15   and they did an AMA yesterday.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:55:55
It's amazing how afraid they are, if they weren't why acknowledge Bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2014-12-10 04:50:02
This one is for Coinkite  I don't know about the H.W1, ask @_date: 2014-12-24 03:28:56
That tool also helps you generate the key, encrypt it and upload, then you just need a passphrase.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:16:09
I love the new [multi-signature]( feature that Coinkite offers, it lets me generate keys offline.
@_date: 2014-04-14 21:14:46
You have a point about taking their symbol, but I think it's too late now, Bitcoin is more important than the "Thai Baht".
@_date: 2014-11-19 05:46:45
Maybe that customer is a scammer have you checked any facts?
@_date: 2014-12-09 15:09:44
That seems to just about cover it, I had a 3-of-5 but was not thinking it this through. I may copy your setup.
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:09:35
Yes, this is not related to Bitcoin, but "Money" sites need to be more careful.

I bought terminals from them before without any issue, have had only good experience with their support.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:34:20
This is a huge opportunity to inform Russians about bitcoin, as it looks like it will be much more stable then Rubles. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:22:02
zz ZZ ZZZZ indeed!
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:30:46
Although this is clearly becoming a religious topic.
I'm a big fan of Coinkite for my holdings and also use Breadwallet for small amounts.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:28:07
These are amazing stats, BitPay is doing an amazing job at spreading Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:30:16
Very happy with Coinkite, the offline tool works great on my air gab machine. 
@_date: 2014-11-18 23:33:42
Yes, 15 units, delivered on time. I know a few other terminal owners none of witch had issues with them before. And I must add that every single time I reach out to support they responded with the hour. You should know that international shipping for large size things, for example multiple terminals come in bundles of separate boxes, and its normal for some to be delayed by carriers. 
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:33:59
Yes, you only upload the xpubkey. This way you can use them for everything, address generation, notification, co-signing with multiple ppl, etc... but they don't have the private key.
@_date: 2014-11-22 16:36:31
I'm tired of FUD in this subreddit. 
**All lies**, this guy left the shipment to rot in customs until the bitcoin price was lower and is trying to scam coinkite. Look at the dates on invoices and shipment dates here  
from this thread 
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:44:28
Seriously? They are just trying to provoke for page views.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:20:46
I use Coinkite for that, they do it very well. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 04:41:34
They are both good, I'm very happy with with Coinkite, they offer a lot of features I use. 3-of-5, Bitcoin Forwarding, Send to SMS and Testnet.
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:25:42
I use Breadwallet for pocket amounts and Coinkite for large balances, happy with both.
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:08:46
I will give it a go, seem like a nice pocket money wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:50:41
Not like this, no.
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:32:20
Multisig on an Air-gapped computer. 
@_date: 2014-11-19 05:52:15
Maybe that customer is a scammer have you checked any facts?
@_date: 2014-12-07 22:49:53
This is pretty cool, I just wish there was less squatting.
@_date: 2014-12-28 17:28:51
Neat! is this a RPI?
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:33:13
The drama never ends, popcorn in the microwave.
@_date: 2014-01-09 14:13:38
I lost some money there, would never use it again. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:41:05
I've being telling you since the first day, you need a free option, now you do! This is the best wallet available, with the most amount of features. Well done.
@_date: 2014-12-24 02:51:06
I have a similar scenario, where I generated 1 key offline and uploaded the extended public key with the  tool and the other is a "Passphrase" type.  Then I use my phone with the "Passphrase" and their offline tool to also sign transactions with the other key. Mind you, you can do both if you upload the private keys encrypted to them, the main issue is the phone can't do offline key stuff.
@_date: 2014-12-07 19:56:20
Unocoin is a great company.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:39:35
Coinbase is killing it with merchant adoption, great job.
@_date: 2014-09-12 15:22:44
Do people still use windows?
@_date: 2014-12-10 05:00:05
That's a lot of coinage, It's amazing how the war on drugs is just a laundry machine.
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:27:16
I think so, as it removes single points of failure specially if you want more people involved. 
@_date: 2014-12-10 05:01:15
Doesn't matter how many they take it down, another one will always come up. You can't kill decentralized systems!
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:38:10
Works fine, I didn't have any issues. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 16:06:11
I second Coinkite.com they have an .onion and I can send Bitcoin via SMS with it.
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:13:00
This have been completely over blown as usual. There is still nothing that can be enforced.
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:09:59
Why don't you move them to Coinkite, I keep mine there because it's full reserve, I can audit my coins anytime and I can Auto Forward a percentage to other accounts.
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:31:31
Whats the app store link?
@_date: 2014-11-18 14:48:03
This is amazing. I have being using your service for a long time and this always bother me. Now I can have more funds in Coinkite with 2 of the 3 keys being generated offline.
Great work guys.
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:20:10
[Coinkite]( does that, I have mine setup to send me an SMS for when the transaction gets broadcasted and for when I get 4 confirmations. 
You can use them as the wallet or have them just watch-only the addresses for you.
@_date: 2015-05-10 14:20:46
Don't listen to this trolling post, you offer an amazing service and I'm happy to pay for it.
@_date: 2015-05-13 04:37:10
I suggest Coinkite, works well for me.
@_date: 2014-11-06 05:58:45
Dvorak is a grumpy old man.
@_date: 2015-05-19 14:22:21
This is so cool! I like how you blocked 911, we have enough drama in this industry.
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:10:46
Works for me. As soon as H.W1 supports, I will use it to be one of the keys in my multisig.
@_date: 2015-05-26 16:24:24
Here is 1,000 u฿  
Sending PIN by PM
@_date: 2016-03-31 16:37:24
Looks like the you create your own private key when you set it up, there wouldn't be a bitcoin address at the production time yet.
@_date: 2015-01-12 19:17:38
Not 100% sure, but I think only Coinkite [let's you upload more than 1 public]( HD key (make them offline)
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:29:18
Thanks for making this video!  100 bits
@_date: 2015-05-03 16:31:10
I can't find the App Store link to get this.
@_date: 2015-07-01 15:05:05
I will make an attempt at the SVG changes.
@_date: 2015-07-01 14:56:05
Great looking buttons, can I change the color?
@_date: 2015-04-15 00:28:36
You definitely have a point about cost. I'm not sure how just one hope effectiveness will be.
@_date: 2015-04-14 22:11:11
BTC =&gt; [BTC-e]( =&gt; BTC =&gt; [Shapeshift]( =&gt; DRK =&gt; [Shapeshift]( =&gt; BTC =&gt; [Coinkite P2SH]( Multisig
Edit: thanks for the Gold
Edit2: added BTC-e in the mix
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:14:13
- Purse very creative way of buying stuff, discounts, remittance with unocoin
- Coinkite crazy good multisig, wallet API, privacy and security for bitcoin
- Coinlocks clever fix for volatility without ever messing with fiat
- Shapeshift no account and easy to convert alts
- Bitrefill top up the phone credits
- OpenBazaar Decentralized market for a decentralized currency
There are many more.

I think it's panama, you can always add more hops. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:28:06
Thanks tip!
@_date: 2015-04-14 21:32:19
Where is this happening?
@_date: 2015-09-23 21:28:40
Great work! Best API and available. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:10:59
This is quite the offering, I started using the co-sign API with out internal accounting system. 
PS: Thx for the testnets.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:09:01
Nice work guys. I'm not sure if he is the right kind of spoke's person, but he does have a lot of coinage.
@_date: 2015-03-17 13:09:29
It's an open system, If you have issues with it, contribute. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 19:31:03
Openbazaar is a game changing project, it just needs to ship.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:02:36
Don't do that. Your phone is not designed to hold secrets and be reliable.
Use multi-signature for large amounts.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:00:06
Big fan of this one, I use 2/3 to store my savings.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:10:32
Overall very positive, this should bring a lot of newbies. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:38:59
I upvoted right when I saw the post! Not sure about the other 10 but I'm a fan.
@_date: 2015-02-23 15:00:59
Small amounts Mycellium large amounts Coinkite
@_date: 2015-02-17 18:39:59
Sorry, I don't mean to be negative, but; 
why shouldn't I just use a secure and on-chain options like [Coinkite's Nyms]( or [Onename]( 
The added miner's fee is minimal and I get all their other features, like Tor.
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:34:38
@_date: 2013-10-18 14:53:18
Coinbase sucks, takes for ever to do anything.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:44:09
I've seen you present about Bitcoin, you are awesome.
@_date: 2013-10-13 21:14:09
Coinbase is the most amateur stuff I see around. So much problems with so little functionality. These guys just know how to do gem install on rails and build a site. They only do plug and play code.
I can't trust my money with them.
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:58:00
They have a very shitty system, and have you seen how it looks?
@_date: 2013-09-24 15:15:34
How do i do book keeping?
@_date: 2013-10-04 03:13:51
It's very possible you are correct. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 04:34:23
Are you sending to Germany?
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:34:30
1 plz, already signed up.
@_date: 2013-10-20 03:35:38
@_date: 2013-10-18 20:25:12
They don't have the funds. Just like banks they are playing with your money.
