I think Joe's approach there is to keep an open mind and keep questioning. Just because an authority states something doesn't mean you should believe it.

Nice post. Thanks for the situation summary. Any hope that we'll see a response?
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:15:17
I haven't moved to using bitcoin instead of dollars, but I think of the ethical implications of using dollars. Every dollar you use is supporting the banking cartel, drug cartel, the prison industry, and the war industry. How many slaves must be murdered before we have our collective moral outrage?
P.S. by slave, I mean anyone using dollars. Dollars represent debt, and when you're in debt, you're a slave.

Yes, just with better distribution.

Could be a ruse, a perfect ruse. But then again, they probably have the wrong guy.

You are right. Government is just a word for people that assume power over others. What those people do with power is what I'm describing. Absolute power corrupts absolutely.
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:58:05
I think it will take them forever to sell. They're just thinking about it now. Think about it this way, if they sell it's an implied endorsement of bitcoin as a currency.

@_date: 2014-03-14 20:43:30
Good point. Do you have any sources that shows how many total businesses accept Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:49:38
True, they need to do better marketing.
@_date: 2014-01-23 17:23:52
They are also trying to make bitcoin relatable to the 'old' people. 'If Edison thought it was a good idea, then it must be good as the idea of electricity.'

Bitcoin doesn't need permission from the bankers. The bankers need permission from their clients.
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:22:54
Well, if the government did it, it wasn't to get more control over people. It gives control to people and decouples control from the state.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:55:09
You may want to also consider pitching the option of paying their employees in bitcoin. More savings!

Peter Schiff does not conceal his disdain and ignorance on the idea of Bitcoin. He prefers gold. He wants a gold backed ecurrency, but what he fails to understand is that gold is a weakness to a digital currency. It centralizes the value so that if the company that is backing the currency has their gold stolen, the news of the stolen gold would collapse the currency. It's what we've already experienced with the dollar. $20 use to be the standard price for an ounce of gold. What happened when the gold was confiscated? The price of gold in dollars went up, waaay up, which means the value of the dollar dropped.
@_date: 2014-02-03 16:21:37
Does it matter where it came from? It is open source. If you know computer language you can read it and understand it 100% without any mystery. Knowing who Satoshi Nakamoto is does nothing for the function of bitcoin.

Yeah, that would be lame. Apple bucks sounds like it comes in a cereal box.
@_date: 2014-03-19 15:43:36
Got it from following the logic that fiat is created by debt to central banks. 
To be more specific, debt isn't a sin, but making profit from debt is a sin.  search 'undue profit'.
The undue profit by debt of the central banks is a sin (according to Islam), and by contributing to the system, we are contributing to the sin.
BTW, I'm not muslim, just an observer.

I think their main point is that the state police don't know how to deal with reports of Bitcoin theft, and are doing some CYA steps to prevent the state from being blamed for not enforcing trade laws regarding Bitcoin.

When most people talk about Bitcoin, it exposes their ignorance regarding money. Most people don't know what it is or how it's made. They also don't know how bad the current system is, and how much is stolen from them by the banks through QE.

Also great for Coinbase. They need these big profile customers for their merchant services to get more big profile clients.

But not too much. Some people have encrypted themselves from their own bitcoins.

Threat of force is only allowed by government in our current paradigm. They are abusing this monopoly. Regulation by threat of force is inefficient as it requires investment in tools of force, which do not contribute to quality life.

The dollar's value stems from the threat of force of not using it as the global means of exchange. Any country that attempts to sell oil for anything other than dollars learns this very quickly; Libya, Iraq, Iran for instance.

Bitcoin can make government better. Imagine a fully transparent government. It can be done with Bitcoin. It should be proven first at the city or municipal level, but I believe it can be scaled.

So it means businesses can't display prices in bitcoin in public. This is not good for the Russian economy.
