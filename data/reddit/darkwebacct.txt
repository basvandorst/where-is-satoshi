I'm having the same problem. Coinbase is limiting to $250-$300 per week. I need 4x that. Please let me know if you find something.

If you were ok with being charged a large fee, what would be your first option for instant Credit Card purchases?

That's funny you should say that, I created this username as a throw-away when I had a question about the darkweb but have actually gotten too used to this account being my primary. I enjoy trading BTC, I used to trade with coin.mx and got pretty good at it but then the site shut down. Much more fun and much cheaper then trading stocks.

Does circle require you to use your real name like coin mx did?

They offered free BTC to any regular users who plugged them on reddit or other various websites but I wouldn't have said it if I didn't love them. Before Coin.MX I had to wire funds to India to get my BTC and it was a very expensive service. Coin.Mx is very stable. I'll take some free BTC to plug a site I genuinely believe in, wouldn't you?

Sorry, I was offered free BTC to explain my experience and I trust that service. You'd do the same thing. I always see posts of where people want to know how to buy BTC, hopefully my post was informative. It's the only service I've been able to find that I trust. What do you use?
