Much better, 
the 'wow' is still missing!!!
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:36:28
Nice try, your smoke and mirrors might work on the other shills and the dim-witted but a quick look at your posts tells the story to anyone with enough of a brain.
But hey, whatever you say.
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:59:49
I actually put the time to check the facts just to shut your mouth.
Outside of r/bitcoin (and the guys does spend some serious time on r/bitcoin, I'm somewhat... impressed?) that guy you accuse me of being an alt account spends his time on r/interestingasfuck
You can check my history, I've never ever posted in that sub... Has to be a coincidence that I would never ever post in a sub I enjoy because I'm on a non-bitcoin account right?
I suggest *you* get that help you are talking about.

Nice one! Another great example of how technology can empower people to fight for their freedom!
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:21:39
That's how it works most of time, technology always end up as a game of cats and mouses with either people or problems.
People will find a way to "route" around it.

Say I want to add some virtual items to a game that would represent financial transactions (like giving out a prize once someone accomplish whatever tasks) using the techs from Counterparty, is there any kind of resources available to help the development process of such items?

That guy suffers from the mental issues he accuses others (paranoia)
@_date: 2014-11-23 22:26:33
He is right.
The guy did a good job covering his tracks though (aka deleting).

If "Huffington Post" was not enough of a flag for an easy, run-off-the-mill article...
@_date: 2019-04-28 12:17:49
Escape Government control.
You think the Commies and that government will just lay down and take cost of the crisis they created and nurtured?
No, they gonna make the suckers, their people, pay instead. And cryptos are the best way to counter the mosquitoes when they eventually come to bleed you dry.

If you are talking about the "financial inclusion" that gives them more and more power over the lives of people, *they have damn well succeeded at that*.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:46:06
It's painful because it's true.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:49:36
They actually will.
Has Mom, can confirm.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:51:06
ooooooohhhh shit!
That was unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:54:48
Clinton shill.
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:17:50
I saw your shilling over the sub.
Decent job, dishonest but decent.
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:25:24




If it was just one, nobody would care about that article.
You are not fooling anyone.
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:52:35
At the end of the day it is a bet we are all making. Whatever the technology it always had its share of detractors, some believe bitcoin and its protocol will outgrow those problems, others don't.
The number of transactions a day is definitely a problem, but one that if it gets resolved will open a *world* of possibilities.
@_date: 2017-07-14 13:00:23
You Know It's True.
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:56:03
[What about this one?...](
@_date: 2013-05-04 16:46:59
The amount depends on the participation. Each Voucher add ~$0.5 to the total pot, probably not much but it is the first event for the game, there will be more and the pot will grow over time!
I can see it being complicated, although you don't have to create a Script you can just join a Noxious Hunt as a player as long as you have the Voucher, if I could make it simpler without killing what the game is about I would!
@_date: 2013-05-02 17:49:29
Thank you ^ ^
I hope to be able to make it so that people can freely trade and gain items and Bitcoins in the near-future, all depends on if people actually like the Events and Hunts.
@_date: 2013-04-09 12:48:51
I could but this guy is doing that for a gambling game and mine is a legit game (most game don't want to be associated with gambling)...
Plus I have no money I can spend to do that...
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:48:26
I thought it was 15 mBTC that's why I was not suspicious. Oh well, no fret!
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:21:59
I can relate to that.
Bitcoin is by far the only alternative for a lot of people in order to do business on the web, you don't have much of a choice when most payment providers either tax you to oblivion, takes forever to get certified for, or just refuse to deal with anything that doesn't have a US Bank account...
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:31:40
Would help a lot if people also invested in the ideal alongside investing for the money, that way they would be okay with whatever might happen. Would add some tranquility to the frenzy...
Even if the price crashes, the genie is out of the bottle, people know they can use it as a valid currency and a way to safeguard/transfer wealth, and in the worst case a good bunch of people using it right now would still stick to it!
@_date: 2013-04-10 13:47:59
Yep, I meant safeguard your money from the current currency risks.
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:36:08
I will be around answering questions if anyone has any!
@_date: 2013-12-10 14:57:17
I think he could care less
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:14:57
Invest in the idea, not in the bubble!
It's not too late as the price is likely to increase as more people like you try to buy the remaining bitcoins.
HOWEVER there are absolutely no guarantees the price will stabilize. If you are to invest do it because you want to help the growth of a de-centralized fixed-supply currency.
If you didn't understand those last few words , you should start researching.
