You give me more hope. I new that on my city there are 5 places that accept BTC. Now I see that there are 10 :D

I don't understand very well. Why are we having discounts there? Why if I buy on amazon it costs less than in amazon? o.O

Yes it said the fee but I did not see it before. Anyway, the point here is that it is very expensive in comparison with banks...

Open Bazaar seems to be the best project we have. Anyway I have read that EBay is considering to accept BTC too.

Look for a local BTC ATM. That is always the best option. You put notes and you receive BTC :)

I looked the price of the BTC. But I just saw the cost of the service when I received the printed ticket :/
