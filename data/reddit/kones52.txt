IS IT THE END OF BITCOIN?
I hate to say this but 1Btc might be worth $500 right now, but in reality, people lost twice as much, had they the opportunity to sell on a cyclic upswing (1BTC:$1000) which would have been inevitable prior to the MtGox crisis.
But now the question is ... Is Bitcoin over?
NO, its not over, but it is severely damaged. People who sit on the sideline feeling wonderful that they didnt store their coins on MtGox seem to be oblivious that their pockets were emptied just the same by this crisis. Prices are falling.
Articles are being written right now claiming or suggesting the end of Bitcoin.
My opinion: Bitcoin is not over, but it is severely damaged.
This will take a while to get over. Depending on how long the story of MtGox continues in headlines. Healing wont start until their is closure of this current situation. Even after then, it will require alot of effort by the Bitcoin community not to see further subsequent hacks and crisis. Time for general investors to forget the fear of losing all of their savings.
Whilst, many of you tech savvy investors realise that this was the fault of MtGox as an exchange and not Bitcoin as a currency. The general investor who would play the critical role of investing big money into Bitcoin, dont see it that way. They dont make the distinction. They see and hear articles about that MtGox thing where everyones money was stolen.
I dont think there is a doubt that virtual currency is the future. But I dont think we are going to see a recovery in the next few years. 
Anyone who was not looking at this as a long term investment is stuffed. I feel bad for all these people who relied on this money.
