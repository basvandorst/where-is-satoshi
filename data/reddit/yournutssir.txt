Please quit with these naive responses.
When it comes to positions of authority or access to a companies inner workings or finances..,
Rule number 1.
The Japanese do not trust foreigners.
Rule number 2.
Foreigners in Japan do not trust foreigners.
Yes he was incompetent. Stupid, most definitely. If you saw his online forum posts asking for help with a PHP authorization script he was working on where passwords where being **passed in the clear as GET vars** you would throw up in your mouth.
Yes he knew he needed help but reasons 1 and 2 above win over the latter or your explanation of his inability to communicate.
I know. I transcribed the leaked bankers meeting tape.
He had no fucking trouble communicating.

Sounds like a hooker is bitching about her now locked up pimp because she feels 'safe'.
I'll be sure to check out the Peak Bar though.
Will have to turn a trick or two to be able to afford it but thanks for the pro tip anyway /s

Someone totally missed out shopping some missing coins QR coded addresses.

No, seriously. Black &amp; white like that and in a hat. Clear sign of split personality / sociopathic tendencies.
If they can pin something on him within the first 48hours he'll get 21 days of lock up to allow the poreece to dig deeper.
Otherwise he's a free man from hour 49 onwards.
Having said that, the Japanese poreece prosecute 99% of anyone who has the honor of wearing the steel bracelets.

Instead just chose to stay around for the easier pay check.
Integrity shines through with this one.

Mark: I'm fucking dodgy
Adam: ok, cool
Mark: you work for me now
Adam: ok, cool
**Whose zero integrity are we talking about here?**
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:06:44
I'm confused. You gained employment in Japan without giving proof of your visa status and whether you are allowed to work or not.
So Mark didn't pay taxes on your salary and was paying you in cash?
It's pretty damn near impossible to open a bank account in Japan under a false name. With 'borrowed' non-photo ID it may have been possible 4 or 5 years ago but either way you would be committing fraud. Not that I'm against an individuals right to maintain a level of anonymity and privacy but if Mark was happy to pay you cash or to pay into a bank account not in your name and ask you to be CEO then surely your spidey sense must have pinged.

He wasn't interrogated nor has he signed a contract.
The Japanese poreece asked Adam to talk to them with no obligation. It's called 任意捜査.
Basically collecting publicly available information on a voluntary basis without a warrant.
He can come here and say what the fuck he wants and it will be absorutree no skin of the poreeces nose.
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:50:29
Mark is obese. Japanese holding cells are not air conditioned nor do they have an all you can eat buffet service. 
Yesterday was fucking hot and humid and this weather will last for more than the initial 3 weeks they will interrogate him for. 
The Japanese poreece know exactly what they are doing.

I've often wondered why Israel. Is he Jewish?
Or were his 'clients' Israelis?
Your world view seems naive yet again. What is there about Israel that is cool? I don't find a country that openly and systematically commits genocide to be cool.

Please forgive the cynicism. I have absolutely nothing against you personally but the naivety you display is cringeworthy.
Any real funds that were up for grabs were pulled out in that hack, by Mark or someone employed to do so.
Emails about an SQL injection vulnerability 3 days prior.
Come on... 
@_date: 2015-08-01 22:32:49
Dude, are you a stand up comedian?
The Japanese poreece already have you well and truly in their sights. They are just squeezing the lemons in order of big first.
And in the 3 weeks that Mark is going to be interrogated for 16 hours a day, every day, you are dreaming if you think he won't say enough to pull you under.
Furthermore you have no idea how the Japanese underworld works.
You snitched on your pimp. And you're not afraid?
The only saving grace would be if he was never approached by the yakuza and/or doesn't have enough real cash to make it happen.

You son, are fucking gold.
A mix of naivety and zero integrity.
How is the high life with your $12 mil golden egg?
Have you stopped to read what you are posting?
Let me help you
Mark: I'm crooked and incompetent. You work for me I pay you. Ok?
Adam: ok, cool
Mark: you know too much, fuck off now and be quiet. Here take this money.
Adam: ok, cool
Adam: hello people of reddit! I'm here to tell you about how fucked up Mark is and how rich I got in the process
Thanks for doing this AMA. It's been an eye opener.

Japanese prison is a breeze compared to the US.
The people replying here don't know shite.
Strict yes, will you get raped no, will you have to shank someone or run risky errands in order to be accepted into your particular ethnic group no.
Unlike the rest of the world, Japanese prisons attempt to rehabilitate inmates.
Don't forget 90% of the US' 2.7 million inmates are in for drugs and or drug related violence, the majority of which are black.
I'd choose a Japanese prison without a second thought in a split second over a random US lock up. 
@_date: 2015-08-01 23:03:43
Prison is not a fucking holiday camp.
And Japanese prisons are 1000% safer than any other correction facility in most of the developed world.

Thank fuck. At least someone knows what they're doing.
Women know shit about high tech stuff. Plus he has redundancy figured out too.

Ex USMC who decided he'd rather stand in the way of 'our' bombs than guide them on to their targets.
If you'd like to hear him rip politicians and news people apart on air then YouTube is your friend. This guy is no nut job. Are you? Am I? Who knows... But not this guy. 
I'd be surprised if he doesn't get offed sooner than later. 
Why is this here?
Because bitcoin has big fish who could help if they cared.
Oh, you really need to watch a few of his videos. He loves tyranny empowering cynics like yourself. It's never to late though ;)

My humble apologies.
I've been away from r/bitcoin since after the mtgox fiasco.
Back then it was all about changing the world.
After a quick scan I see it's all about dildos and cam girls.
