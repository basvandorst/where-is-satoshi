yeah, anonymous comment on reddit, someone claiming to have won some BTC.  I'm sure the IRS with their depleted resources will put a team on it right away.

The code will not lie, it can't.  I've created, decrypted and swept near 100 bip38 wallets without issue.  Somehow the password you used as the passphrase and the password you think it is, is wrong.  I always create my passphrase in keepass, super strong and then copy paste it as my bip38 phrase.  If I have a large amount then I'll do a test decrypt before depositing funds (for my own peace of mind).  Somehow you have a password incorrect.

I'm not sure I get you here.  What constitutes reusing an address?  Are you talking public key, private or both?  Can you outline a realworld example of how an address is reused?  I have several cold storage wallets and am 100% confident the private keys have never been seen by anyone (created off-line, etc).  If I continue sending coin to those wallets is that "reusing" their address?  If so how is anyone going to know my private key in order to compromise security?

What?  There is nothing wrong with BIP 38.  I would argue 'keep it simple' as possible.  BIP 38 wallets in several locations with a decent pass phrase will be plenty secure.  I could send you my BIP 38 wallets right now, you're going to crack my 30+ character pass phrase?  I don't think so.  And what about my non-computer genius wife when I get hit by a bus?  "Dear wife, i have 7 armory multi-sig wallets scattered throughout the globe, good luck".  I have her and my kids trained to use BIP 38, it's secure and a nobrainer.

The last year I've done bank transfers to guys on localbitcoins in exchange for bitcoin.

I could say I had a gambling problem on darknet, was buying bitcoin from people and lost it all gambling or watching porn or live webcams.  Then what would they do if I never cash out?  They can't tax me for buying bitcoin.  Will they look for evidence of me gambling it away?  Sorry, I used VPNs and proxies and the gambling sites were temporary and no longer exist.

I agree with some others in that big corps and politicians see bitcoin as the ultimate way to exchange bribes.  Corps can easily obtain "clean" coins to bribe politicians with.  Lobbyists will be shaking hands and exchanging paper wallets.  Politicans can then use the Bitcoin for prostitutes, gambling and drugs, etc.  It's likely already happening, their young techie aides helping them secure the coin and show them how to use it.  No way they will shut down the best thing to happen for them in years!

It depends how big the Bitcoin economy gets. It could be savings across the board, down to the raw materials to create a product to a finished delivered product to me which I then sell. So if I am selling a widget that costs me $70 wholesale, total profit is $20 after sale. Maybe in a bitcoin economy the widget now costs me $60. I make a profit of $30, but I offer 10% off for bitcoin. My profit is now $27, up from $20.

It depends how big the Bitcoin economy gets.  It could be savings across the board, down to the raw materials to create a product to a finished delivered product to me which I then sell.  So if I am selling a widget that costs me $70 wholesale, total profit is $20 after sale.  Maybe in a bitcoin economy the widget now costs me $60.  I make a profit of $30, but I offer 10% off for bitcoin.  My profit is now $27, up from $20.

I've done one better.  Several copies of steel BIP38 wallets securely placed in my vicinity (home, bank, etc).  Family are aware of this and each family member has a USB drive with keepass.  The encrypted keepass database contains my BIP38 passphrases for the wallets.  On event of my death or what have you, my attorney dispatches my keepass password to my wife, who can then open keepass and obtain the passphrase (she also knows where the wallets are).  If my wife is dead keepass password is dispatched to next in line. etc

This discussion in many ways shows that these security issues, concerns and lack of cohesive layman's method for securing BTC does not bode well for Bitcoin.  What good is ease of use for buying bitcoin if the average consumer doesn't understand how to secure it?  Multi-sig, Hardware wallets, hot wallets, mobile wallets, cold storage, etc -the consumer does not want to deal with this and they will not deal with it.  I'm confident in my storage but I'm also an I.T. geek, but when friends want some BTC it is difficult to explain to them how they need to go about it.  This should be in the background.  I guess the killer app is type of storing and using coin that is absolutely fool proof and my grandma could figure out.  Hmm

"Many security experts have already voiced concerns that fingerprint scanners, such as the one in Apple's new iPhone 5S, are flawed and not as secure as their makers claim.
Now one leading security researcher has taken this a step further suggesting the technology could actually lead to an increase in crime, with the robberies potentially becoming more brutal.
Marc Rogers from San Francisco-based firm Lookout said: 'Fingerprints are not fool-proof and can be duplicated and as the usage of this technology increases, we can expect that duplication technology will improve as well.
'Thieves in some regions have worked out that you can force a victim to unlock a secured device,' and in extreme cases this brutality could lead to fingers being cut off."

I still don't quite get this re-using address vulnerability.  Let's say I purchase some bitcoin at an exchange, when I do this the coin always arrives at a new address that is generated by the exchange.  I log into my exchange account and transfer the coin to one of my paper wallets.  Is there a vulnerability in sending additionally purchased coin to the same paper wallet?  The paper wallet has never been online and never been spent from.  Wouldn't the vulnerability require spending from the paper wallet multiple times at the least?

Interesting. So what about BIP38 paper wallets that have had coins sent to them maybe 3 times?  Does BIP38 add another level of security to this attack vector?

@_date: 2014-12-14 22:22:01
I still see no technical description on how re-using a public key compromises security whatsoever.  If your private key is secure there is no issue.  I could "re-use" an address 100,000 times without a single security risk.  The only drawback I can see is people might know how much you have and come after your physical personhood.  But as for having your coins stolen because your public key is widely used over and over isn't possible imo.
