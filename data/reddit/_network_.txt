You mean when person a invest with you and you say you the cash then person b invests with you so you use that mo ey to pay person a and when yoj reach the end and there is no more money everyone looses out.  That ponzi scheme.  You do understand that without an exchange your btc is worth nothing?  How do you convert it back to fiat?  Not funny thing that mt gox was shown to have actually stolen btc feom itself before they announce the lost of all those btcs.  So to me it's a ponzi a lot of people lost loney and they stile some of it.

Well just look at the closure of btc-e as an example.  I mean I'm no rocket scientist but when you see that all exchanges that start to make btc to fiat conversion more practicle start getting shutdown for various reasons,  it's hard for me to believe the ability to cash out will be there forever.

Yes I will shelter and feed a family off reddit gold.  What we buy and what we need to live are not always the sMe.  Can I do groceries with bitcoin?  Pay my power bill?  How about gas and oil for home heating?

Was there not already a known flawed that asic systems use?

Because no one feels like bartering anymore?  Also what do you produce of any worth?  If you have a garden and you give your neighbour produce and he in term cuts your lawn.  Well congrats you just used a form of currency that is not issued by the government and doesn't require to be taxed.
The fact is most people would not be able to live this way because we were brought up in an age of consumption, work to make money, so you can spend that money.  How many of us would even know where to begin if say 50 of us were placed ona  remote island with sufficent natural resources?   Do you think the general populous would have the work ethics and know how  to till the land, find seeds and plant crops?   You would be hard pressed to get all 50 persons to work together.

Your money is insured at the bank even if it gets robbed you still have access to your money...

When you cash out and there is an extra 100k in a bank account under your name the IRS will have some questions about where the money came from.

Correction, a closed source coin that is made based on an algorithm created by the NSA...  and we sll know they would never ever ever have any kind of backdoors or know  issues that trhey could and would exploit...  never

Ture but your btc has no real world value unless you can convert it to fiat somewhere down the road.  It seems everytime an exchange starts making btc to fiat a normal process they get shutdown somehow.
It's like me selling you a goose that lays golden eggs but no one wants to buy gold...

I see it as a modern day ponzi scheme.  Early adopters are ok but you will reach a point where you are unable to get your investment converted back to fiat when you need/want to do it.
You always hear about the big exchanges failing, either by being hacked or because they were deemed to facilitate money laundering and their assets get seized.  
To me it really sounds like it's just a crisis waiting to happen.

So anyone that invested btc into mt gox and lost it all did not loose their investment?  But some people that invested after them but cashed out before them were able to o tain their investments again correct?

No but it is a great trick lol
Here people waste a bunch of energy on something you could achieve by simply bartering with your neighbours.
21.1 houses could be powered for one day by the energy required to process 1 transaction on the bitcoin network.  It’s literally a way to get people to consume more energy for no reasons at all.  Even if all the energy used was from renewable sources it’s a huge waste.
Edit:  if treated as a country it would be  in terms of power consumption.  Let that sink in,  some countries use less power then the bitcoin network.  And that is just the bitcoin system we are not including all the other crypto currencies.

I’m not sure what your experience is with satellite based internet,  but there is more then you and the satellite involved in that network.  While we do have bi-directional satellite internet we still require base stations to talk to the satellite and for the connections from satellite A to be able to talk to the connections of satellite B.   Also there is tremendous latency over satellite and blockchains have a first come first serve approach to validating new found coins.  Not to mention your connection is highly weather dependant and needs constant calibration to handle the fact that your structure will settle and your alignment will get skewed.  
It is also crazy expensive to do any kind of physical maintenance on a satellite.   It is not a very robust technology when it comes to upgrading.  
You are all free to believe in what you choose,  I just really don’t see a future in crypto currency.

I really feel as is crypto currency is a big can’t see the tree from the forest issue.  We are constantly trying to be greener as a society but the energy consumption of the bitcoin network would rank it as the 40th most power hungry nation in the world.  It’s basically just another way to inflate the value of the U.S. dollar.  Since the U.S. dollar is how we trade crude oil, and crude oil is still one the most popular way we generate electricity,  a rise in electricity use means a rise in demand for crude oil which in turn boosts the u.s. dollar.   
I know I go against the grain on this one but I really don’t see a net benefit to crypto currency.  The main argument of separation of currency from state completely fails to address the fact that it would just not work without state provided networks (ie the internet).

It was accessible before then it is now...
If you look at bitcoin as being the most mature crypto currency,  you would see that when it came out anyone could mine via gpu.  Now unless you are part of the asic gang you can forget about mining.
The intention was good, with a big mining pool a lot of people have a say into how the tech should progress, but in it's current state the asic miners have more pull then the devs and the people using the currency.
