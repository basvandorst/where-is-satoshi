Sell wall at 13k. Seems like it even grow a bit
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:41:15
Its been there for a few hours already. If its keep steady it might just keep on nibbling from it?
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:37:19
Today is a bit early it all depends. I think we gonna try 12k -13k first. If we break thru there we go up, if not we might see it going down to 8k. Anyway everybody is just guessing. Its like gambling. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:42:44
We should to it in every major world city at the same time fore exposure. New york. SanFran. London. Paris. Berlin. Tokyo. Lots of homeless everywhere and its all winter atm, so it hard times. Not sure about Cork? City. Never heard of it.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:01:59
I'm 100% with you
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:45:22
Will they pay taxes on their capital gains?
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:11:47
nice selling wall building at 11K, you will have to wait for your 20 a bit. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:21:49
China is waking up lets see what happens now.
Edit: ffs didnt even finnish my sentence and saw a big red bar
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:48:05
Lets hope
@_date: 2018-01-28 19:32:58
I wonder if it already happend. Thats why everything went up?
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:29:07
Services like steam and stripe stopped accepting bitcoin. So we even got a degrade adoption :(
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:49:29
When is that news coming?
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:23:02
To be honest alts always make me sleep bad. Such a volatility. But thats probable beacause I dont want to hodl them like bitcoin. Back to some good nights of sleep.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:15:06
Yest yesterday. Sold at night. Wont buy now its going down
@_date: 2018-01-20 11:38:22
Well to do that you will have to hold 
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:46:05
Go bitstamp. Thats what I use. I have a euro account tho not sure about pounds. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:58:23
I think it will go down. Unless it goes up of course. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 23:14:11
Somebody quoted this:
My breakdown is... Bitcoin falls...Alts fall harder,
Bitcoin rises...Alts rise slower,
Bitcoin is stable...Alts pump
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:19:53
Yeah its very close to 10.9k now. Let this be a lesson, nobody can predict bitcoin. And be carefull with reddit financial advice.
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:58:35
Bold statement! 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:55:02
I'm sure brexit will make things even more easy
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:50:34
Is it too late to say sorry?
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:11:25
Now you're up all night, checking your phone, in the hope she texts you.
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:01:56
Most alts look like just bots. Highly manipulative market.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:11:20
Thats coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:55:22
Germany also is 0% after 1 year
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:07:19
Bitcoin is dropping too
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:15:56
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:16:02
Still waiting for mine too. Ordered 18dec. Had to find support email in reddit. They removed all contact info from their website.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:15:46
Unless.you think it will go up. But i woudnt risk it for the short term
@_date: 2018-01-22 13:31:00
I can also assume that there are a lot of trading bots running. Hence the similar market changes.
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:53:09
In 3 days the first futures contract ends no? Seems like someone is trying to get his/hers target.
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:50:13
Buying orders coming in now. Lets see how the resistance is to go up. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:37:40
Thats strong. Dont sell now. It will go back. Give it a few months. I know its hard. But you managed to hold until now so. It might even drop more to 8k or so. Definitly dont panic sell then, it will start rising from there on.
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:41:10
Lol same here. After all this holding I sold my alt coins yesterday, with this bitconnect incident I felt unthrusty towards alts. Its all up by 40-80% now. Ffs
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:23:02
Am I looking at the wrong graph? Mempool is still same size as 1st of Jan. 
edit: ok I was looking wrong.This one is more like it 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:30:15
Just bought 50 tulips today, price was 9 euro. Think was quite fair.  
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:48:55
Im guess we have to wait a couple of hours and see if it holds?
@_date: 2018-01-28 15:48:48
Audit news? You have a link?
Edit: just did a quick google, got it
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:24:24
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:12:42
Sorry had to move some coins arround
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:11:16
RemindMe! 2 days
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:42:10
Nowhere, all is going as expected searching 8k levels
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:07:19
I dont understand either. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:26:08
I read this with the voice of Tommy Wiseau.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:00:36
they are one of the biggest players in ecommerce payment service. Unless you're not running any online business, you probably never heard of it yes.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:23:15
It already went to 10.2k today
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:00:47
Like every body always says. Relax zoom out the graph. See we are still up. Nothing to worry about
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:59:12
1. most coins are traded on bitcoin
2. bots control the crypto market
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:51:50
Nice video
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:23:57
It will relax give it a year .. or two 
@_date: 2018-01-20 20:32:52
Same reason why bitconnect went back from 8$ do 50$
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:01:50
Use bitstamp
@_date: 2018-01-04 00:34:54
I would say yes, did you read the article?
@_date: 2018-01-20 13:26:38
You are the 3th one talking about tether falling down today. Is there any news I missed? I just check tether price. Its still the same?
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:47:30
Every time blockfolio struggles to load/update, you know something is happening with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:14:19
Depends on the exchange. And the fee you pay.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:19:13
I upvoted hope someone can help
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:53:29
Buying orders are getting eaten and sell wall is building. Tough one. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:32:00
Looka like its tilting again, but you never know
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:20:53
Forgot, dodging taxes 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:17:05
They are saying this since oktober. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:38:30
Ow shit :D
@_date: 2018-01-03 11:10:36
Fair enough 
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:20:44
I think so yeah
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:28:35
I dont think almost nobody here is all-in on bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:16:57
Doesnt the article say it's for current users with a virtual account to switch the a regulated one? And not for new users, they still have to wait.
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:27:24
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:09:22
I have been recommending bitstamp since September. Somehow people just keep on asking about coinbase.
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:10:18
A seamammel 
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:14:06
Own damn 2018 doest have this crash drops yet like the other ones. So looks like we are still will be going more down
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:15:47
COULD. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:14:33
Intersted too
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:02:56
Some people still believe the earth is flat
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:50:29
Polititian? Lol, he sold some firecrackers/explosives in the past, not a polititian.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:20:23
Well some of the altcoins still rose 50% overnight so I felt a bit gutted. Maybe it was for the best, looking at it now.
@_date: 2019-07-09 09:30:20
Newbies sold under 10k again. You will hear their moon howls when they buy back in at 16k.
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:54:59
Yes move to the Netherlands and become resident. In europe you pay tax according your country residency. 
@_date: 2019-07-05 07:33:57
100k or? Haha those kids, lollipop money
@_date: 2019-07-05 07:32:50
So the first question he asks is “what is the right price to buy it at”? Not sure if he understood it then.
@_date: 2018-01-05 09:10:52
Is it happening? Sold all my altcoins yesterday for btc. Fingers crossed
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:11:51
I think we will start hearing some news cover on the radio when it hits ath
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:03
yeah logged in had a look around didn't sell. logged back out. all good 
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:18:52
This shows how many people are in for speculation. 1 tiny news-flash and vast majority starts selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:17:48
Whit bitcoin volatility you gonna hit that every 5 minutes?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:16:41
That would be sweet. But that's wishful thinking.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:45:46
Price of bcash is rocketing and coinbase hasnt even opened yet. I'm very curious whats gonna happen. I wish I had the same amount in btc as in bcash then I woudnt be so nervous.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:25:21
S punches the lights out in step 1 and runs with cash. Done
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:52:29
They already dropped last 2 days
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:00:03
30% is still very good.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:45:52
yeah goes really quick. This is just some whales making money. Gonna sit this out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:52:07
Ive started 5 months a go still dont have a hardware wallet. Just start. Buy some coins or work for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:17:51
Same here!
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:52:54
Or at 100$
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:30:26
If i was a miner and see I would overmine and have to give 1btc extra to my investor, I would shut down ny operation for that month and save massive on the enegry bill for that resting period. Dont see why I would keep on mining. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:28:49
Plastic in the ocean is one of the major problems these days affecting everybody sooner or later. Would love you seeing throwing som bitcoins towards projects trying to tackle this problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:19:49
I heard it acually just stores the private key. Not your coins. So its basically a 100$ usb stick and cant even store 5 private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:54:57
Oh boy fasten your seatbelts
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:02:42
Correction last week
@_date: 2019-07-09 22:18:00
There will be for sure some fireworks around 20k
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:53:13
Is this world wide or usa?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:10:28
How and where you can track this? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:23:38
Jup one of the only alts which stays fairly stable
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:24:59
Is this for real?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:46:07
Dropped pretty low tho :D but yeah back up
@_date: 2017-12-25 14:02:29
Anybody's thoughts on Dash. Maybe it sounds more centralised but I like what they are doing. Also makes bcash absolute, since they have the same purpose.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:37:43
Wtf litecoin. Bonkers. Im not touching that. But great for the people who got in 4 days ago.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:18:27
Lucky you! Wish i had some spare money
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:38:17
omg it's going strong 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:39:31
Just surf and enjoy life there
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:10:42
Why? Its still hovering around that price. 1000 less or more is nothing
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:22:58
Thats a new feature for xmas. Think xmas lights. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 11:54:33
I agree 10 is still too high
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:29
Its cool to see bitcoin rising. But al my other coins getting some serious beating. Everybody selling to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:24:49
Looks like bcash is loosing hight now
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:21:38
Wtf I went to the toilet and 1k plus
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:12:25
Which retards were even buying bcash at +-9000$. Maybe good they halted. Some people where about to loose a lot of money. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:19:02
Thata exactly what bother me the most. He thinks himself he is the CEO of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:43:12
This guy has balls. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:46
wha massive sell. Somebody is buying a tesla 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:33:09
This is mind blowing. yesterday I celebrated btc reached 10k euros. Today I woke up and its nearly 13k. Not sure how to feel about that.
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:45:33
Price of bcash is rocketing and coinbase hasnt even opened yet. I'm very curious whats gonna happen. I wish I had the same amount in btc as in bcash then I woudnt be so nervous.
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:06:32
Damn reading this makes bitcoin gold even more making sense
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:12
If you want to buy btc with it you would avoid paying 2 times fees for example
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:36:30
Haha bitter
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:18:49
Why dont you sell bch for usd and then buy btc? If you really dont want to wait.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:34:10
Here we go
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:25
Yeah man at least you got safe. We might end up with nothing if it goes as quick down as up. Im holding anyway. Wanna see how far this goes
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:14:38
Very good video!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:58:43
Lol for real?
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:33:47
Acually it was super bitcoin wich was today. Where you got that 15dec date from?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:38:54
Fasten your seatbelts! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:22:29
Make sense cool. Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:50:48
I can imagin some people also placed market orders
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:09:33
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:51:50
Or sometimes per day :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:50:49
Isn't bitcoin illegal in Indo?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:04:11
I woudnt be to sure about that. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:48:24
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:21:22
Why would you do that?
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:26:43
? On bitstamp 300 to go
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:36:02
Slowely? It went up 2k in the last 2 days. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:22:03
i use it works well. When coinbase crashes they most likely still work
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:11:22
No huge sell well at 4k why would they buy at 9?
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:52:22
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:47
Small for now. There will be some small ones of course
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:47:46
Dip was 2 days ago, off to 12k now. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:20:41
Its been pretty quiet lately. Looks like a lot of newcomers are buying alts because of the cheaper price tag.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:19:53
t at 11 and 12 and ...
@_date: 2019-07-02 23:15:05
He’ll buy at 12, then it goes down to 7.2 where he sells. Then it goes up again, he buys at 9.1 and hodl. Then he sees it rising to 35k and is euphoric, he’s calling moon 150k. But the price corrects and drops. But he hodls, cause he knows better now, but then the price keeps dropping. Flash crash to 5.5k he panics he sells all. Price bounces back above 10k.... he buys in again at the same price we are now but with 1/3 of his money left.
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:05:25
Nha looks like its stable
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:49:23
I love those posts, so many of them lately, no wonder price keeps on rocketing. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:49:32
Why? We are driving 14 hours back home from a 3 day ski-trip. Just had BurgerKing. Now checking Bitcoin in the car. Perfect Xmas!
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:09:13
And a new crypto scammer has been born...
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:28:44
S11 e9 i think
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:13:48
Since when is -3% dark red? Thats nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:37:45
What? Where you read that? Impossible.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:11:38
Yes. But you can mine other cryptos too.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:08:48
You probabaly few more hours
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:12:51
The trading volume dropped significantly. I hope it's safe to say the price is stabilised for now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:49:18
Yes its very stable
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:15:36
you mean 15K wall
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:43:04
Bit late to sell you should have done at 19 or 17 better hold now. Not worth the risk
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:54:36
Correction. Tripled. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:33:05
If you have bitstamp in your country i prefer that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:33:55
I hope you bought 15 min ago :D
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:50:49
Usdt is worth slightly more then usd
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:35:33
Juat leave it in a paper wallet. Why would you wanna move it to coinbase? To sell it? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:55:02
Today is a crazy day. I feel we gonna end it with a little sprint from btc as well.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:51:20
19.3 usd? bitstamp highest was 16.2k? that's a big gab. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:28:22
He lives of pizza orders
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:56:10
So if that is basic economic thinking, why did the price of bcash tripled last 2 days? Just trying to understand.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:17:36
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:11:30
The second it hit it.. wha what a drop.. but then the speed of going back up . Insane
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:22:09
Dont worry there are worst things in live.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:41:08
They never gonna open the trading
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:19:00
You have your screen upside down? Mine shows a big green dildo. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:53:41
Overvaluation. Bcash attack. Network clogging. Hight transfer fees. All at same time
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:14:17
Maybe they are already sitting on some significant gains and rather sell and waiting out this shitstorm.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:28:30
Im glad im seeing this kins of questions too. Instead of, when will the price drop/ rise?
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:26:03
Scary obsessive
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:34:45
jup looks like it
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:21:58
The graph represents that yeah. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:51:31
Just hodl and by the end of 2018 it might be £120 and you can buy yourself that wel deserved supersized BigMac Menu at McDonald. To the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:34:20
its already half way back up
@_date: 2017-12-25 12:45:13
Yup looking good
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:09:50
Imagine if bitcoin still doubles or tripple in price. There will be more 1.8M withdrawals and something tells me there will be a lot of money missing to pay this out.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:11:39
Your ledger wont pay you dollars

@_date: 2017-12-26 18:50:37
It just went from 20k to 10.5k You will have to wait a bit now for the next correction
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:53:34
I would have kept it 50/50
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:43:19
Maybe at a time slot too
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:20:03
Just send it to a wallet on your account on the exchange
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:42:01
Holy you are right. Sell walls still rising. What gonna happen when things go live? Cant believe people still buying bch on for example bitstamp exchange. This doesnt look good or?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:55:56
You guys celebrating 12k while euro is still trying to hit the 10 :D
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:51:18
Trading volume very low since a long time. Good sign!
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:24:47
they approved futures trading in US this morning so its going up
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:46:34
Question, what if I for example buy LTC with my bitcoins and 2 days later do the exact opposite. So i never convert to euro's or usd. I would still pay tax right on this conversion to a different crypto? Or?
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:56:17
X10 is an illusion. I think people still dream about that. Not saying it might never go x10 l, but at least be prepared to wait a couple of years. Its not gonna be in 5 months. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:00:20
Its like playing poker. You think its gonna drop, you sell, and before you know it raised 1k. Think about the people who sold and still are waiting for a dip from 6k 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:10:30
Maybe just leave it at coinbase for now
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:38:04
So you are saying if it would hit 20k it could drop to 4k? Uahaha sounds like xmas. I think 4k everybody would just buy a lot
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:53:17
Or the price might be at 20k end of month and you might regret not to have put everything in at once. Or it might be at 5k and you feel relieved not to have wacked in all. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:20:35
1 - 2 years maybe
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:31:51
There is one today as well
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:03:44
Only after big rises or bad news/ uncertainties. So I guess the futures launching may be the next one. Then again you never know if it will or will not drop. Just hodl. I tried a few times to sell and buy in the dip. Sometimes it works most of the times it doesnt. At the end of day I still missed out on 2k if I would have just hodled. Its tempting thinking you might quickly earn some extra cash. But its totally not worth it in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:56:45
Dont, just hold. Unless you wanna lose them. 1/5 times you trade you gonna loose some, lots have people have this experience,, its impossible to time the marker unless your maybe running some algorithms 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:53:55
the amount you invest goes up as fast as the market goes up. if it's $200 or $1k obviously that doesnt make a difference. It can also go down slowly. Just put in what you are willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:08:51
Have a good sleep first. Take a holiday. Go for a hike a few days. And then ask yourself the same question. Don't make any abrupt decisions, especially when you are exhausted. Whatever you do in the end, it doesn't sound like you have much to lose. You're in a luxury position, good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:36:28
I also bought on 5000. Then I waited. Eventually bought again big at 9000 wich I thought was risky just before the 10. Well its 17 now. Not too bad. Maybe this moment could be the same before the 20. You never know.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:16:01
Ok btc as wel as bch are going up now. I'm confused. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:53:30
Looks like bitstamp is hitting the 17k wall for 2 days now. No coming thru. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 11:26:40
Yeah but you would get less then usd so in the end its the same
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:25:38
Kraken is always a bit lower. Today on bitstamp was 9950! so gdax probabaly over 10.000 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:34:36
Im acually more comfortable with this then ot rushed from 10k to 19K in a few days
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:29:01
They only thing a gov can do is not accepting bitcoin as official payment in general
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:32:11
Transfered some bitcoin arround yesterday to different wallets paid arround 11$ all was confirmed in 10 minutes. Why would you pay $40?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:31:53
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:43:32
Damn bit too early. Riding down again
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:08:24
Which dip? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:46:04
Bitstamp. So far i hadn't had any problems with them. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:33:53
I think we are ready for another run up. Think the weekend is gonna be maniac

@_date: 2017-12-28 06:54:23
So many trading bots running
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:13:03
there are people who are saying that since it was hitting 5000 :D (probably even before, but that's when I bought in, no regretz)
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:15:52
It feel like 50,% of the people only heard or got into to it this week :)

@_date: 2018-05-30 01:47:12
Damn so much euro fud. I bought back in since 2 months. I still though bitcoin would go lower. But with whats happening in Italy I'm willing to take the risk.
@_date: 2018-05-10 18:36:04
I would say support 8800/9100 is strong. But if we break that I could see it dropping quite quick.
Edit: big IF

If you want I might be able to help out with some Ui/design of I find some spare time. Let me know
@_date: 2018-05-09 01:05:04
Yeah right. 500 euro for a ticket which you can only buy with visa/mastercard/AE/ bancontact. What a joke, cant even pay with bitcoin?

No its not. Wait until there is no uncertainty in the market.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:43:26
maybe its good all these exchanges are down. if not, a lot of people would have sold at this moment. which would have been way worse. price is already back up. just relax. hodl
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:34:04
If yoi are too worried about it then better sell now. But best thing is to just hold and dont panic as well.
@_date: 2018-06-10 23:25:53

Im just thinking about this this Dutch guy who sold his house, kids toys, bought bitcoins and move with the family in a caravan. He might be rich in x-years, but I'm highly doubtfull he's living a nice live atm. The emotional rollercoaster must be immense.

Aah this one again, bullish sign!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:04:53
relax people had the same yesterday. No access and gutted they couldn't buy in the dip. Guess what, it's even lower now. Wouldn't be surprised it takes another swing down. 
@_date: 2019-06-22 10:48:33
Nobody is making returns atm, cause nobody is selling.
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:09:44
wait until they wake up and also want to take profit
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:00:12
thats scary man. I checked a few addresses where those "compromised" wallets send their money to. And found within a few second already 2 wallets which received between 1M - 2M Btc. This can be a coincidence and looks very organised. or?
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:42:35
Whats the point of never selling. Its like buying a car. But never drive it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:28:36

@_date: 2018-03-02 13:12:44
Wow you just opened up a whole new world for me. Never thought of it looking at it from this angle. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:30:40
Or until after september when we know what mtgox is gonna do with his remaining 160k in bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:03:41
I think we will have to wait for a while. Maybe after bitcoin hit another ATH, they will do another run?
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:54:57
Might be a bull trap tho. See first if it holds there /s
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:06:22
That means if bitcoins goes back to 18k i can buy 2 beers! No thank. I will wait for a good entry point to invest some real money. And I think a lot of people are waiting at the sideline atm doing the same.

@_date: 2018-03-08 01:03:12
Which year?
@_date: 2018-03-01 12:52:05
It mean thats the reason we are at 10.7k atm
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:28:51
? I think you have your screen upside down buddy
@_date: 2018-03-30 22:07:05
It doesnt even manage to go above 7k what are you talking about?
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:38:25
Look at the in year chart. It pumped, now it's dropping
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:52:35
is this a comment from October?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:20:55
So it the china total ban that causing the drop atm?
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:31:22
I must admit its very unlikely. The only way I see it happen when something bad happens with Tether.
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:10:25
of course, everybody is trading to tether now. To secure their profits.

Yup idem
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:50:42
Just wait 5 years, all will be good
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:11:47
It went over 8k?
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:27:56
Im still waiting to drop more, this thing is still too expensive for something that im not gonna use. Maybe people will use it in the future, maybe not. Mut 9k is too expensive for a gamble.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:58:32
Haha true
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:48:21
Mine where as well then there was this day a week back were there was a lot of fud about usdt. I bought back in cause I didnt want to have usdt. Im starting to think, I fooled by the community, just trying to force people to buy back in. Wish I would have waited.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:02:11
Wha what a service. Kraken is cracking up their game.
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:43:58
To be honest that makes most sense for now. I dont think we can justify bitcoin price higher then 12k just yet.
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:01:52

You know a lot of people make money by shorting atm. For them it doesnt matter. Bitcoin up - down. They make money either way. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:18:32
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:42:53
if we go down now we will fall thru 10.8k
edit: looks like the buy wall is building back
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:29:28
Well wich ones would have sounded best? i think he made the right choice. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:13:29
If he's cashing out he doesnt loose money. He realizes profits. Which is never a bad thing. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:14:48
I rather buy bitoins for 9K than 12K. What the hell, if it reaches 9k I will wait until 6k. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 10:49:22
So what is this big red one? A more centralised node?
@_date: 2018-03-08 07:56:38
'jumps' lol there will be plenty of time to buy back in. We knew 11.7k was a break or make. If people wanna gamble let them gamble. Once we pass 12k we can start talking again. Until then only way is down.
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:46:18

@_date: 2018-03-05 14:09:26
I dont think the risk award ratio is high enough. I wait until we pass 11.8k this few 100's not gonna make the difference if we go to 17k later. If dont break the 11.6 - 11.8k today. I will find a better point to re-enter.
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:01:37
What happened to that 8k wall??? Jesus, not even a tiny bounce back.
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:43:12
Thats why they will buy monero ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:05:48

Damn thats cruel. But probabaly true.

If you wanna buy 10 bitcoin better to do it on a verified trading platform. Of course they will need your id verifiction. Buying 10 bitcoins anywhere else on a shady exchange seems highly risky.
@_date: 2018-02-19 13:45:23
" it's more healthy that it's slow instead of crazy indecent rises."
It just rose 85% over the last week. That's indeed a very slow healthy rise.

I dont see how we could drop under the 10.3 support level looks too big? Same happend on 9.3 two days ago. We bounce a few times from it and then we continue up.

When I woke up everything was bright green. I almost bought back in, then somewhere in the back of my head said: do the opposite of what you think. So glad I didnt.

Is the us and asian stock market dragging bitcoin down as well?
@_date: 2018-03-14 20:51:51
They will be stuck in a wallet just to look at. Maybe in many years with quantum computing we will be able to hack those old wallets and retreive some lost treassure. Is it good for bitcoin? It means less bitcoin in circulation, higher value.

If that is rent money for september you might be ok. If that is rent money for next month I would cut your loose here and work some extra hours the comming days. Betetr be safe then ruined.

I think too many people are too eager to pick up some cheap coins. From the moment we drop and they will find out/ think they missed the last dip they will fomo buy back in.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:36:10
Like happend 2 days ago?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:48:08
did the same in okt, nov, dec. Then said the same as you. "from now on I only HODL" HOLDed all the way down. Great! Sold yesterday when I was about to make losses. Shot up straight after. FML!

I agree. You read all this storries and thinking this will never happen to me, almost happend to me as well once. Just thru circumstances not paying attention I almost lost acces to all my wallets. Since then I lost a bit a faith. You can argue to not trust a 3th party . But not sure Im ready to trust myself. And I'm sure the majority of people are not ready for this.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:07:50
Well there will also be less Bitcoin dumped on the market since its only half. So demand &gt; offer which also influences the price.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:01:50
