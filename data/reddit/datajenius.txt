I've been a developer for 20 years, currently transitioning my career into ML. Pursuing an MS in Computational Statistics and pursuing all the education I can get on Coursera, DataCamp and Khan Academy. 
After 20 years in the business world, I'm trying to break into academia. I'm not the biggest expert. The more I learn the more I realize how much I don't know. That is why I am seeking collaborators. Luckily I'm just smart enough to realize I'm an idiot.

I have not read either paper. Can you link or give me the titles, please? I'm adding all the papers I can find to the above thread, except a few I've found hiding behind paywalls (e.g. "Application of Machine Learning Algorithms for Bitcoin Automated Trading" by Kamil Żbikowski). 
75% accuracy sounds great, but I would love to know more details. Did it catch the dip over the past few days? Please feel free to pm me or discuss right here in public; whatever you prefer.

I would love to read your paper. 
Your points on cross-validation are well taken, but in a time series, we can't simply randomize our data, so I'm curious how your team selects the train v. test v. xvalid sets. 
Speaking to pure mathematics, what I can't get over is how, on a long enough scale, BTC appears wholly logarithmic. In fact, the recent correction is bringing it back to where it should be, following the curve to 100k. And to be clear- I am a total skeptic. But hell, weird is weird.

Great subreddit. Thanks!
I am reluctant to use S&amp;P 500 or other stock indexes as a model here because BTC is such a different animal. For the sake of perspective, S&amp;P 500 gains 12% a year while BTC can gain 12% in a day. It appears almost perfectly logarithmic, and that *could* make sense if we look at the intentional design of the algorithm to restrict supply coupled with the adoption curve of cryptos in general. 
But there I go talking out my ass like everyone else. I want **data**. Opinions be damned, right?
