Some people I know said that it had gone up too much already, and to show them it doesn’t matter I am buying $100 every day for 20 days. Today was day 11.

I’d eat John McAfees dick.

 I got it at a 50% discount to the ticket price, I buy the dips and spend on up days. The bitcoin I spent is worth more now, but once it leaves my hand it isn’t mine anymore.  But that’s how bitcoin encourages saving over spending, the cash you hold is worth less every day where the bit coin is worth more.

I got about a 50% discount on all the money I spent that weekend, my cost on bitcoin is always less than the current high, I buy it on the dips, spend it on up days. If it’s down I use cash or credit cards.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:39:47
This is the correct answer, plus I buy on the dips and spend on up days netting a discount on everything I buy.

Do you have or use bitcoin? Through Coinbase I got a shift card, it swipes anywhere they take credit cards. Whenever I swipe, they transfer the approximate amount of bitcoin (usually +10 to 15%) to the card. When the transaction settles, they credit the difference back to bitcoin in Coinbase. This works anywhere that accepts credit cards, not because San Francisco.

Plus we’re not buying Lambos any more, we’re getting Tesla roadsters...

 We’re getting teslas now, keep up.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:38:16
Shift card does it all automatically, it settles in a couple of days.

 Think of it like planning a tree, it would’ve been good to do it five years ago, but five years from now you will still have a nice tree.

 You know what other form of payment people use for prostitution and drugs? You may have heard of it, it is called cash. The beauty of bitcoin is you don’t need a bank to use it, it is stored on your phone or computer and can be transferred between individuals safely quickly.

So in this scenario, who has the incorrect assumption of worth?
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:24:38
No, they weren’t. You are looking at a split adjusted price.

 Not to worry, I have been buying every day, a set dollar amount right when I wake up every day just to prove a point. Tomorrow is day 7 of 21.

Are you aware that you can buy from your bank account without transferring first? Coinbase locks in your purchase price.

 I went to a concert in San Francisco month ago, used bitcoin to buy the tickets, pay for the hotel and buy all my food and drinks for 36 hours I was there… I don’t know what you’re talking about when you say you can’t use them for anything.

Coinbase, link bank/credit card, order shift card to spend. Done. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:42:56
I spend bitcoin all the time using my shift card
