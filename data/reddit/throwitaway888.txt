You’re right. Just checked and it’s $200 more than gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:44:36
A 1300 fee to sell 4800 is way too large of a fee...what exchange are you using 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:56:26

Honestly would not doubt it. 25k by Christmas 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:50:33
Just my .000002. We were all hoping it would somehow hit 10k by the end of the year and now it’s 14.4k. We were hoping it would hit 13k by the end of today, now it’s 14.4k. It’s going fast. 15k by tomorrow morning.

@_date: 2017-12-07 00:47:29
Are you talking about that guy who made a post here and said he was from 2025 and bitcoin went too far?
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:41:27
That’s insane i would not sell it right now with whatever exchange you have it on
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:13:37
i read a post on here from a guy desperately pleading for help recovering his account with multiple coins because he wrote down all but one word and planned to remember the last one. Exact same thing you are trying to do. Just write it somewhere separate. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:23:16
We already did....it hit 19.3k today and corrected down to 15k.

Just remember we were all hoping that it somehow would hit 10k by the end of December...now we are sitting at 13k and not even halfway done with December. i think it’s possible.
