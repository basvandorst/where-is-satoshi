Try blocktap.io
Small result sets are free to query, and larger result sets you can pay-per-request with the Lightning network, no account required.

You can perform advanced querying of nodes by using the SQL-like query syntax. If you click on the "I" icon next to the query box you can see the operations that are currently supported.  One the list is filtered, you can highlight those nodes or redraw the force-graph with just those nodes in it.
We plan to add more features to this project as we get more feedback.

My understanding is that the network graph is dependent on a node's view of the peer to peer network.  It will be different depending on how long a node has been online, what peers it has connected to, and what channels/nodes it has seen in the past but are no longer active.

Put this together over the last few days to give more information on the nodes that are running.  Source available here:

That's something we will definitely be adding in the future.
