of course with the spread of connectivity they can use bitcoins to buy server space and that sort of thing, possibly even items from websites to have shipped (etsy shops?) to them - for a lot of people if they can exchange [int.] labour for goods and services without having to go through their dodgy banking / gubment then all the better.  (i suspect hongkong will ship them exactly what they need, marked as 'gift' :) )

yeah the 2nd one was kind of compelling, i love the idea of bitcoin and used right it's awesome - of course this society is going to fuck with it, years from now we may shake our heads to read corporate interest actively worked to discredit things like this. but still even if that is true we should actively work to discover and iron out any problems, when you're involved in projects like bitcoin you should know you're paying to be part of an experiment; if it doesn't pan out then you're effort isn't wasted and in a sense you just paid for a step in the right direction.  Maybe the next step will work better.  
  
Keep the money flowing, when you've earn't some spend some - don't think about things is terms of traditional means, don't expect perfection and improve it whenever possible.

Run! the Paultards will kill us where we stand!  
  
Have you read, [Progress and poverty]( it's a really neat read and deals with what you're talking about.  Proper economies that can work and false economies which are bound to fail, he has a really good way of explaining things - well worth a read.  
  
I completely agree with what you say by the way, hoarding certainly hurts economies.
