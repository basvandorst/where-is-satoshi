Bitcoin owners have become greedy like the bankers. They want a bitcoin monopoly.
The discussion shouldn't be bitcoin vs litecoin. It should be crypto vs fiat. Centralized vs decentralized.

I do the Daily Tactics everyday.... I only get 3 of them. I'm a noob chess player tho.

How do you withdraw money? Is it secure to do that from a BTM?

Good points. I believe we should be aware of the flaws of Bitcoin and point them out-not to destroy Bitcoin but to improve it and make it better. To do what we originally intended with it not just to make a quick buck.

Buy a car wash and tell your friends you made the money from gambling... Have your wife launder the funds through said carwash.

He lives in Japan and I live in Canada. We message each other via Whatsapp. He got carried away... but I still think he raises so good points.

I think I need to learn more about BitPay but wow that's an amazing service to be able to guarantee $xxx=1btc with how the price is going up and down right now.

I think BitPay is a great, forward-thinking idea. When bitcoin prices stabilize it will have a greater value. Can you set how quickly you would trade bitcoin to cash?

I disagree with you. I think he wants this thing to work but he see's these flaws with the system. 
I raise them hoping to see if we as a community can nullify these points with constructive criticism or build on Bitcoin to make it more robust and dependable.
