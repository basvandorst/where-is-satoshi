Good article, though I wish there was something a little more substantive and definitive about the taxes and accounting.  This is the bigger challenge for me, and I think is just as big a barrier to entry for a lot of small business folks who do their own bookkeeping.

Yes, this is shameless self-promotion, but it's well intentioned.  We're doing our darndest to promote Bitcoin and hope to make a difference.
Now if only our suppliers accepted it.

Democratizing manufacturing, democratizing currency and finances.  I feel like they go well together.

Just curious where we met you, and who you are!  Feel free to PM!

Glad to hear you're happy!  We really do try.  Between now and the fall we should have some pretty disruptive stuff hitting the market.  We're getting excited.

HA!  I'll do that.

There are a number of printers that use 3mm PLA, including older Makerbots, Trinity Labs machines, Printrbot, etc.  RepRaps are whatever the builder wanted to use.
There are benefits and drawbacks to each diameter.
If you're interested, we've got a blog post that has a table of different printers and extruders with the diameters they use: [3D Printer Filament Buyer's Guide](
Here's another post that's got much of the same information, but formatted differently and is a little more to-the-point: [What Plastic Filament Does my 3D Printer Use](

We love getting payments in BTC; we don't have to worry about charge-backs (we recently had a couple bite us pretty hard), and it's just awesome.
Thanks for your business!
