Turns out I mined a total of...£0.07 worth of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:48:03
No, it wasn't Deepbit, but I can see why you might think so. Thank you though!
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:51:49
Yes! That's it. This is why I love Reddit. Now to figure out my login details.

In the space of about 90 minutes, it dropped $300 and then regained $300 just as quickly. Is this a bug with the chart or is something actually happening?

Graphic designer here. Can I suggest some helpful formatting tips to help get the most out of your book? Specifically, increase the line height to make it easier to read. There's so much to take in, but the tight linespacing makes it more difficult.
See example: 
On the left is mine. On the right is yours. Just a few little tweaks make it a more enjoyable read.

Except none of that gave me advice about my actual question, unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-11-07 19:04:51
See title.

Just trying to seek some help from what I thought was a helpful community. If you can't help with my issue, just move on without being flippant.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:46:29
Can I ask why an individual is better than an exchange?
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:47:29
This is great advice, thank you.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:27:29
I'm not selling it immediately. Why would you be so keen to buy?
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:01:49


Can you tell me more about what this is please?
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:17:24
Can you tell me more about these potatoes? 
@_date: 2019-10-07 04:30:59
Thank you
@_date: 2019-06-20 17:34:55
I understood some of the words you said.
@_date: 2018-03-13 13:46:28
This is how Eastenders will begin from now on.

As a fellow average investor in Bitcoin, I would say change your thinking. Stop thinking "Will the price go up soon?" and think more "Is this a useful technology and do others think so?". If the answer is yes, guess what, the price will go up. If might not be $1,000 a day. You might even have to wait five years for it get to a point where you want to cash out, but it *will* go up. Don't wait for a dip because if you miss it, you'll be asking for a dip next time too. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:55:55
You don't have to buy 1 whole coin. You can buy 0.00000001 if you want to. In ten years, 0.00000001 might be worth $1,000 on its own.

What if I want to pay CoD?
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:50:23
Imagine if this was the Facebook logo and how uncool and weird it would be. It's kind of the same with a cryptocurrency logo.
@_date: 2018-03-04 02:47:32
1 Bitcoin can be split to 8 decimal places. I think that's what some people forget. Yes, only 21 million full Bitcoins, but you won't be using a full Bitcoin for most transactions in ten years.
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:07:59
What would the main downsides be if mining as part of a pool? I understand there's a fee involved, but anything else?
@_date: 2018-02-13 02:15:58
Appreciate the help, thank you!
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:28:19
I get that the price fluctuates, but why does it seem so systematic over the last 24 hours? There are clear rises and falls that follow a pattern. Is this just a chart rendering issue or something else?
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:16:29
Except it didn't - I trade stock already. However, I didn't have to go through such a rigorous verification process for it. I didn't have to provide scans of my passport or bank statements. This is much more arduous.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:32:25
I looked at bitbargain and it looks promising. However, signups have been halted under after Christmas so it's useless right now.
Bittylicious however, is not something I'd heard of and so far, this looks promising. I've submitted my verification details...again.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:07:50
It's been two hours now. Shouldn't it have come through by now?
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:44:46
So what you're saying is bitch ass shit mother fucking mule bullshit shit shit bitch shit shit?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:55:03
That's what I did, but it doesn't seem to have worked. I replied to the bot with the withdraw all message and my Bitcoin address. I've been waiting for it to show up in my account. I thought that should happen within ten minutes?
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:39:02
To perhaps put things another way, this is the address of the deepbit.net miner: 1MHiYYKmXJPLhbEq2oihAHaHHmwveSm8bU
I can see that there's over $100,000 gone through that address because the address is the only one they use at the bottom of their website. I understand that it's *possible* to have multiple addresses/wallets, but if you've only got one, then that opens you up to a lot of unecessary privacy issues.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:24:37
Did you just tip me $5? That's pretty damn generous of you. I don't know why I keep getting these tips from people especially when I'm having trouble withdrawing them, haha! Thank you so much for your generosity. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:26:18


@_date: 2013-12-02 18:33:44
I think my point still stands though? If I know that X address belongs to Y person/business, then I have a better idea of how much money they have. If I have an account number and sort code of someone's bank account, I certainly can't access their finances with it.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:45:17
By all means, point me in the direction of something better please.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:18:55
I got a message from the bot saying "Pending tips to you have been finalized." a while ago. Shouldn't that mean that it was sent to me? Here's what I did:
I accepted the tips by sending the bot "ACCEPT".
Then I withdrew money by sending the bot:
**+1Dgs3tFj993hSudvodYsniR7PcjZ179XH9 $1**
I seen the dollar amount, but thought this was a tip for the bot to actually support it. So then I sent the bot:
**+1Dgs3tFj993hSudvodYsniR7PcjZ179XH9 ALL**
The bot said:








A while later, I sent the bot a "BALANCE" message. 








So now I'm really confused. Where is the money?
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:12:51
I got your 1mBTC! I can see that in my Blockchain account. Thank you for doing that! At least I know that it is actually working.
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:40:50
I received this tip and MrMeem's tip further up (for which I'm amazingly appreciative!), but I don't think I withdrew the balance properly as my Blockchain address 1Dgs3tFj993hSudvodYsniR7PcjZ179XH9 still shows as 0.
Did I do something wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:21:17
As most people have pointed out, localbitcoin is great if you're ok with meeting people. Me personally, I want a digital option and that is what my post was about - the hoops you have to jump through to buy online.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:53:00


@_date: 2013-11-30 03:01:09
I personally have chosen to keep mine on Blockchain.info. It's basically online banking, only with Bitcoins. That was definitely the easiest part of beginning my journey into Bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:37:29
But it's not the same. If I give you my sort code and account number, you can't go see how much I have in my account, but you can still pay me.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:26:14
But that's my point. As soon as you give out an address, you're opening yourself up to a public audit. Why would any business want to do that?
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:38:07
I received this tip and bryanmicon's tip further down (for which I'm amazingly appreciative!), but I don't think I withdrew the balance properly as my Blockchain address 1Dgs3tFj993hSudvodYsniR7PcjZ179XH9 still shows as 0.
Did I do something wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:24:32
I got my account roughly four or five years ago via iii.co.uk. I needed to supply a few details online and on the phone. Received registration info via post. It's why I'm so frustrated that buying Bitcoins is so much more difficult when I'm used to trading stocks with a lot less sign up effort.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:12:05
Because buying a digital currency with a physical transaction really does defeat the purpose.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:12:48




Which is why I was even more frustrated that they turned down my documents.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:25:39
It's very easy to see the difference.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:59:30


It's that kind of elitist attitude that makes an otherwise attractive prospect unappealing.
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:47:41
Is coinbase *only* for US residents? The site doesn't make it clear. I'm in the UK.
@_date: 2013-11-29 22:10:00
I don't think you understand. They want to see it's on paper.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:06:36
Yep. That's exactly what I did, though as a jpeg, not a PDF. They specify no digital documents allowed. It's quite silly. It's like the fidelity of the document is somehow important, rather than the information.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:21:40
Blockchain has a page that references SMS deposits: 
However, when I log in, there is nowhere to find it. Confusing.
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:23:20
Could you help me figure out why the other transactions didn't go through please? See my reply to tastycat:
