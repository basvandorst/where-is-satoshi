Regardless of any fork, would it be possible to smooth phase in a second PoW algorithm over say 2 years? 
You know, so that it starts 100%(2SHA256) : 0%(XYZ) and ends in 2 years with 0%(2SHA256) : 100%(XYZ).
This could really help decentralizing Bitcoin. Anybody wants to code some pull request for this?

To me this looks more like P2SH AKA multisig

After the next 2 halvings smaller miner will depend way more on tx fees than larger miner. So larger miner can push smaller miners out of operation by shrinking the block size.
BIP100 heavily biased toward smaller blocks which will result in even more mining centralization...

A compromise would be **BIP101/2MB**: using BIP101, starting with **2MB** instead of 8MB.

In this interview Rusty says that the lightning network basically needs much larger block than we have now. He even estimated that if we had the lightning network from day 1 we would have had full blocks already 4 years ago....

@_date: 2015-08-30 18:12:28


The sad thing is that this will likely be prevented by BlockStream/BIP100. A single 20% miners can keep the block size at 1 MB. Lightning+BIP-one-O-one would be a perfect match

Hoping to get some huge reward from government/banks once they have succeeded in destroying bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:11:08
There are 2 options to make bitcoin able to handle more transactions per second:
a) increase the block size by changing 3 lines of code 
b) "invent" a huge and complicated workaround and try to get rich and famous by doing so
Half the core devs prefer (b) because $$$

Yes, that was the intention. Now carefully read this comment and look above who has written it: 


It seems that those who have financed BlockStream to improve Bitcoin have found out that BlockStream has a different agenda...
@_date: 2015-09-05 09:31:10
This graph is just FUD. I run several Bitcoin nodes, and it only occasionally reaches 10kB/s.
BTW, you can even calculate this yourself. Because of an issue that will be optimized in the future, a block has to transferred twice to each node. So currently we have 2*1MB ever 10 minutes = 2MB/10min = 0.2MB/1min = 200kB/1min = 3kB/second ~ 30 kilobit/second.
Lets to the same math for 8MB blocks: 2*8MB/10min = 16MB/10min = 1.6MB/min = 1600kB/10min = 1600kB/1min = 26kB/1sec ~ 260 kilobit/second.
So even those "huge" 8 MB blocks stay well below 1 megabit / second. But it seems today nothing is easier than to spread FUD...

Address reuse is of course supported. But I agree that it should be discouraged to do so.

So you did not get my play with AA, WWW and TCPIP?
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:16:22
Block propagation happens in 2 stages.
At first only the block header is sent to all peers (80 byte regardless of the block size).
After this each peer that does not already has this block downloads it. But this download happens only once per node, because there is no need to download a block multiple times.
So on average each node can relay each to only 1 node. Keep in mind, that in a system with "n" nodes there are only "n-1" possible receivers, because 1 node mined the block and hence already has it. You are very fast running out of possible receivers.

@_date: 2015-09-04 18:19:13
Exactly, now you understand! By limiting the block size (and trying to remove SPV), BlockStream tries to force those people to either use some BlockStream technology or nothing at all. The real block chain is either too expensive (very high fee because small blocks) or not reachable (no more SPV) for them.
@_date: 2015-09-04 15:29:22
I don't think it is that black and white.
I think that this "stress test" is actually healthy for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a system that is not protected by law but by actual math and technology. Once we start replacing this armor by "law and order" we have already lost, since a real criminal would not care about the law. Even worse, we would basically lose the trust-less aspect of Bitcoin, because once we have to trust the law to protect the Bitcoin network, we can just trust our fiat money with all the implications. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:44:46
It is you right to deny the truth and believe whatever you want.
@_date: 2015-09-07 20:31:14
Your math is wrong. 16MB/10min == 16000kB/10min == 1600kB/1min == 1600kB/60sec == 26kB/1sec ~~ 260kbit/sec
Regarding internet connections. Just take Africa, as an example. When those folks use Facebook, ever single packet/image/message/whatever has to travel across the ocean to reach some US based server. In contrast to this, Bitcoin is P2P. It is enough when 1 fast local node transfers the transaction/blocks in and out from Africa. Other African nodes can now connect to this one server. Bitcoin adapts somewhat automatically to this. Beside this look at the above bandwidth values and compare them to internet connections speed that you have all over the place. You need an order of magnitudes more bandwidth to only have Facebook in a single internet cafe in Africa...

Because BlockStream is anti-Bitcoin. BlockStream could be very well be the only force that actually manages to destroy Bitcoin. One of the fundamental things is that miners secure the transactions by investing huge amounts of resources. Once we rip miners of all their funding (no more block subsidiary, and almost no fees because of small blocks) they can no longer mine, and we will have no longer any security. You cannot have the one without the other. BlockStream tries to grab the whole fee revenue by establishing a network above Bitcoin. The only solution for miners would be very very high fees. The end result is basically the same as our current banking system.
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:15:31


Not necessary. But then why do we even have Bitcoin? We already have the SWIFTNet, WesternUnion, Target and other settlement networks, that no one can use. If we are forced to use a local let's call them "bank", why Bitcoin?

No need to trust me, or actually anyone. Read it up yourself. Read Wladimir ("lead" dev) comments about SPV. Those BlockStream employees produce enough texts for everyone to understand the bigger picture. Unfortunately, I have to add. It would be great to have back the Bitcoin as it was all those years under Gavins lead.

See, he is really good at tricking people.
For example replace-by-fee destroys zero-confirmation usages, even for those $3 coffee. If you carefully read the dev mailing list, you will find out that he entered the Bitcoin world with the intention to make double spends easier - replace-by-fee is only the newest reincarnation of this attempt.
In recent years he got really good at playing the good guy. Still, every little contribution from him contains something that indirectly weakens Bitcoin. But these days it is no longer as easy to spot as it was in his beginning.
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:51:49
To some extent you are right, but keep in mind that all those "3rd world countries" also have excellent internet connection, just not to every home. And I frankly don't think that all those 5000 full nodes have to be in extremely rural Afrika ;-)
EDIT: I recently read that the BlockStream cartel also wants to remove the SPV interface. Most probably because that enables all those rural areas to use SPV wallets. Now if you look at the smartphone rates in, for example, Afrika those are rising at a very fast rate. So in a few years everybody in rural Afrika will be able to use Bitcoin, using some SPV client. If the BlockStream cartel has not removed support until then....
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:31:19
Not who, but what: just $21M that have been invested into BlockStream.
Really, since the LN uses hubs it would be inconvenient to use some other hub then your transaction peer. Enter network effect. In the end everybody will be on the same hub, or at least using some hub of the same provider, AKA BlockStream

Satoshi had a brilliant understanding of economy, and apparently we has also a good developer.
Then came Gavin, a very good developer, but sometimes does not understand how economy works.
Then came the current one, also a good developer, but without any clue about the economy. 
Am I the only one that sees the fatal pattern in this succession?
@_date: 2015-09-04 16:48:24
Yes I know there is no magic involved. Only a few, but quite good, developers.
This is why I think you are wrong. We know, developers tend to be "busy" as long as there is no urgent need to fix anything. They like to code something more interesting. So those "test" put pressure on them to enhance the armor.
Every attack vector has some solution, however, if it is a lot of work and the solution could cause some controversy then developers tend to say "busy" as long as there is no urgent need.
Since Bitcoin is global, you will always find a place where the attack you are planning is actually legal. But I admit that it is most probably some never ending arms race, which in itself is healthy.
I know you disagree with my position implicates that you, Gavin and a few other devs have to enhance the client "for me". So in some sense I implicate that you work for me, without even asking.
In the end, what are you suggesting? Using PayPal, because it is perfectly protected by law? I even can charge back!
Or maybe some world police that catches every person that makes some unnecessary transaction? We could call them USA, one day they will have their own payment service, let's call this system "dollar"... oh, wait!

I am sure you also believe that the NSA does not exist, and Snoden is just a imaginary person... Sometimes the truth is just the truth, and not some conspiracy theories... But I understand that sometimes it can be hard to accept, because then you have to admit you have been fooled by someone.

Either you have some fundamentally misunderstanding, or you are a time traveler from the distinct past...
Yes, it will be as hard as it is today to run a full node over a satellite link in the middle of the jungle. Everybody else has no problems running it, even on some private home computer. In a some huge parts of the world you even can no longer order any internet connection below 1 Mb, and 20-100 Mb is the usual household size. So welcome to the present :-)
Ever heard of netflix? People are downloading data the size of the whole blockchain on a daily basis. With your amount of fear, netflix would simply not exist.
Or BitTorrent? Anyone that has ever used a BitTorrent client just laughs at this tiny block chain size. And we have only 1 block chain. BitTorrent has thousands and thousands of files this size. The whole Bitcoin network is not even 1% of the BitTorrent network.
EDIT: and that is even better than Satoshis vision, because in his written vision the full nodes end up in data centers....
@_date: 2015-09-04 20:47:37
Sounds like a good idea.
@_date: 2015-09-03 11:12:45
Increasing the max-limit does not increase the block size, but it increases the maximum *possible* block size. Miners will still produce small blocks because otherwise their blocks could be ignored by other miners.
Similar VISA also has to plan for extreme days like black Friday, but that does not mean everybody buys more each and every day, just because the VISA network can handle more transactions per second.

You are not alone, most of the developers have no real clue. Listen to that interview with Rusty. Even he admits that he does not understand all....

Quite interesting results there
@_date: 2015-09-04 17:44:09
So you actually undervalue yourself. Without this upcoming fix the client could crash, now it will be able to sustain. Perfect! So it seems this "stress" test has some intermediate result, since the upcoming release will be able to handle it. Of course, it will right now not be able to prioritize it correctly, but lets do it step by step. BTW, thanks for doing this work :-)
In the end there will be no way around some block size increase. That is the ultimate defense. I could easily write a script and overload my local bank with transactions, but it would cost me some unimaginable amount of money. Bitcoin is only vulnerable because a "free transaction slot" is a way too scarce resource. So to fix this there are only 2 options: a $100 transaction fee, or more capacity. This "stress" test could help to open the eyes of small-blockers that we only have this 2 options.

If BitStamp would be Gemini the buyer could now easily have this trade to be reversed.
It is such a weird feeling to notice that an exchange does actually honor the trades. As far as I can remember even the worst scam exchanges did at least honor trades and not reverse anything because some large customer wants it to be revered...
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:00:33
It would be interesting to at least force them to state what the actual threshold numbers are for being "erroneous". In other words how much do I have to overpay per coin to have the trade reversed? Or is it the total? It seems that Gemini does not specify rules and therefor can do as they like. Or maybe it just depends on the bribe...
@_date: 2015-11-15 01:27:31
I see. So the only good use case for this "reverse feature" is to safely trade in a fast moving market. If it did go wrong claim the trade to be erroneous. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:23:52
They tend to steal customer funds by disabling the account...
@_date: 2015-11-15 00:35:14
I am pretty sure this can somehow be exploited for profit. Sell a huge number of coins flash crash style. Buy most of them with a second account and immediately withdraw them. Then claim for the trade to be reversed and withdraw the coins a second time.
Anybody already working on such a scheme?
