You are probably seeing that error message because you are using a proxy. We had a few cases of abuse and had to restrict access for proxies. 
I just updated the error message to actually explain the cause of the error.

Working with banks is proving difficult, we have been running against limits set by them. We're working hard to improve this.
Thanks for trying us out, hope you liked it!

Unfortunately not for now. We only operate in Spain, but we're definitely working towards expanding to more countries!

Please accept my most sincere apologies for this. Our agreement with the bank specified a daily cash flow limit we didn't even think we would come close to when we signed it. Now, a few days after launch, it turns out we're having so much volume that we are exceeding that limit every day.
We are hard at work renegotiating a higher limit with the bank, and talking with other banks, to make sure we can fulfill all demand. We expect to have it sorted out in one or two weeks.
We just opened the service again with today's limit, if you try it now you should be able to send 200 euro.

Prior to launching this service, we were a Bitcoin ATM manufacturer, and we manufactured ~10 ATMs. This service works not with our own ATMs, but with existing Spanish banks ATMs.

Just woke up to this. It's great to see so many encouraging comments! Thanks everyone.
We are definitely planning on expanding to other countries and ATM networks. We're also working on the Buy feature.
If you have any questions for us, just ask!

Feedback taken, thanks a lot!
The SMS is sent by the bank, we'll see what we can do.

This is correct :)
We update the exchange rate in realtime too.
