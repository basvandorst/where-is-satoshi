thank you for the response...Like I said I've been reading and researching BTC for the past 72 hours constantly. The CIA meeting with top developer is very telling..

Are you trading daily? is that how you're making bitcoin?

This is all very fascinating. I'm new to bitcoins and have been reading feverishly about it over the past 72 hours since purchasing.
I have a very simple question, what happens to the viability of BTC when say, a large gov't (US, GER, CHINA) bans BTC altogether. They just make it illegal to own or operate with BTC...Wouldn't that slow or even halt the growth rate because "normal" citizens won't be inclined to purchase them? Idk ,I'm just throwing something out there that I was thinking about.

Where are you coming from that brings you to Chico?

Yea, but I'm talking in terms of large merchants like an Amazon not being allowed to adopt it. Isn't that how we expect BTC to rise in value, if big time merchants allow it as form of payment? You get my drift? If the common man (don't care if it's not PC) isn't allowed use BTC for daily activities such as shopping, business deals, etc, then how will it grow? Maybe I'm not thinking this through.

And I understand that it will always be a viable form of currency/payment on the internet for the purposes it is being used for right now, but if legitimate businesses aren't allowed to adopt it, then what? It will never grow to the size we hope/anticipate, correct?
