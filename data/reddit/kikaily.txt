Thanks. I check that stuff, but now months later this is my situation.. =( It's bad, but my spirit will recover, and I will hopefully learn. Thanks.

I sent it from Binance and I don't think it was a wrong address, it isn't similar to anyone I use or used in the past... I simply forgot in which wallet I had it, as incredible as that might sound... =(

I also tried bringing this up in the Star Citizen community which I am part of too. Many downvotes as you say.
Well, we'll have to wait to merge those worlds... Crypto and games.

No, I burned the original paper after placing in in a few other places. What I mean is that the one I burned was probable correct, since it had 24 boxes where to write the words. The other ones are just normal papers.
@_date: 2018-07-04 19:16:58
What do you mean?

Well, if you have absolute control over your assets (not their market price), you have absolute responsability. You can buy Bitcoin and have it in an exchange and that would be like a bank or a stocks company for all I know, but the asset beeing Bitcoin. That is possible and plenty of people do it. The rest usually prefer to own their money instead of having it tied to their name and legally own it but not technically or phisically. For me, it's the security of exchanges beeing hacked, unable to re-compose. Also, they sometimes freeze assets, deposits, site goes down, etc. =)

I meant a crypto exchange, which happens a lot. Stock the risk is grand manipulation of big money, i guess, but i know almost nothing about stocks.
