I'm not talking about unionisim or in it's void case, seperatisim.
The interesting thing here, at least from the point of view of an american, is that, at least these past 5 years, we see in the NYT, CNN, Reuters, the massive protests. It's been goinig on for a long time, so it seems either the spanish government are inept at solving a political dispute, or the catalans are fucking crazy (how spanish people lead me to believe). Frankly, it seems that it's the former. And I imagine, it's for lack of interest of the parties in governance, correct? Which in the end, gives validiacy to their movement. 
I say free catalonia and free bitcoin.

Exactly, so allow catalans to vote.

Do you know what happend October last year to Assange?
@_date: 2017-09-22 22:28:05
Yep. You compare Iraq to Barcelona. 
As unamuno said, you are all Barbarians that cannot be reasoned with.

Juan Carlos.
Whatever, all spanish shills are the same. Pride will be the end of spain as has been for the loss of their empire.

I'm american and been in iraq. 
There were spanish soldries that were called siestasoldiers by americans for how bad they were.
You all are a liability. Unamuno said it best, you are nothing but barbarians.

Juanjux? Juan.. You sound like a Spanish shill.
Even if it's true, you sound so "simplistic" I don't buy it.
Didin't this start 5 years ago when the spanish government declined talks about a new form of finance governence in Catalonia?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:43:35
It's rhethorical. 
I'll be happy to go and ask in Catalonia. 
Nice try spanish shill.
