Not a horrible analogy when you look at btc as a store of value as many people are saying.
More people are viewing it as a hedge against things like inflation. Younger generation is turning to it over traditional stocks/funds for retirement. Its being called digital gold; and its liquidity destroys gold, and fractions of bitcoin still retain their net worth just like smaller pieces of gold jewelry. Popularity + first-mover advantage for a store of value commodity?
MJ rookie card sounds about right. Alpha/Beta Black Lotus if you prefer.

These excerpts were taken from wiki page of Gold-as-an-investment:
- Like most commodities, the price of gold is driven by supply and demand, including speculative demand. However, unlike most other commodities, saving and disposal play larger roles in affecting its price than its consumption . . . (on liquidity): Most of the gold ever mined still exists in accessible form, such as bullion and mass-produced jewelry, with little value over its fine weight — so it is nearly as liquid as bullion, and can come back onto the gold market.
- Gold, like all precious metals, may be used as a hedge against inflation, deflation or currency devaluation . . . "The currencies of all the major countries are under severe pressure because of massive government deficits. The more money that is pumped into these economies – the printing of money basically – then the less valuable the currencies become."
I believe bitcoin is becoming the "digital gold" more than it is staying branded as the currency first proposed for it. I think comparably, the above illustrates why it's working and may continue to work for the same lengths of time proven by its physical, tangible counterpart; bitcoin, like gold, can be speculation-driven. And it's easy to argue bitcoin is far more liquid than gold could ever hope to be. You combine these factors with the increased adoption of cryptocurrency (and the most popular one with first-mover advantage) as people hedge against things like inflation, and well it's just a recipe for increased demand on a supply that is harder to come by with each passing day. Rocket fuel, if you will.

It's the weight of one over the other on the whole.
If you watch the buy orders and sell orders actively, you'll see the movement of price coincide with the last highest order, regardless of whether it was the buyer or seller's price. More of one side will dictate which way that price movement goes for a given period of time creating cool things like candles and wicks.

Haha, forgive me for making a parallel to gold, a time-tested commodity for thousands of years.
Actually don't, that would imply something religious and you're not about that. If you let any amount of risk consume you with paranoia, then I don't know what to tell you. You should probably stop using the dollar then, or at least don't save any in the bank. Spend every last cent you acquire, quickly, every moment you can. If you want to talk about inherent value due to faith, look up how fiat works.
Good luck.

I can't afford a whole lot, but I am going to cling onto the little I have for dear life. I also wish I didn't spread it into so many alts; I picked some winners sure but my overall bitcoin went down. I suspect this may be the case for some time to come, that is, bitcoin outperforming most alts. Add up all the value or "free money" from past and future forks and you'll be sitting pretty.

And people probably have hoped, or still hope, that gold jewelry can be more than some kind of status symbol, or gold bars can be more than a hedge against inflation or the USD losing value. But it hasn't stopped it, and with a lot of the early adoption coming from millennials, I can see bitcoin/digital gold being used a status symbol as well. Its liquidity justifies the growth in my opinion, and in 2018 we're about to see an explosion of adoption from the older dogs as well.
This "price going up" that we're seeing is nothing if you ask me. So if you suspect these current gains are blinding people, then I'd find some really dark sunglasses for the next few years. The 50k valuations are just as real as the 100k ones. I'm skeptical about 1m, but once we're at 100k it will become feasible. The goal post really is just getting pushed further and further back as someone recently illustrated. And the people who are keen enough to pick up on the fact that a real transfer of wealth is taking place will likely want to retain the wealth they were already storing. In the form of bitcoin. It's speculative. It's a bubble. It's a bandwagon. But I personally don't think any of that matters in the scheme of things. The bubble-popping even the most paranoid of people are worried about is likely still very far away. All of the "crashes" from here on out will just be minor blips that recover quicker and quicker. To me, there is no wrong time to buy (if you can afford the swings or discipline yourself to ignore them completely) UNTIL the price of bitcoin is 100k+

You'd do better to avoid the masses of "masternode coins" that are coming out by following this logic, not avoiding the one, true bitcoin. There will always be an attempt to takeover bitcoin, but all have failed. So long as you know which one it really is, there's no issue in the price going up. In fact what you're describing is exactly why the USD should be of greater concern, and may even be contributing to the transfer of wealth we're witnessing as it seems to decrease in value.
EDIT: People have taken risks to get burned by bitcoin for what 8 years now. And every dip has been insignificant so far. One day, you might put your faith in that track record, like people do today for something like the Vanguard 500 which has had double digit returns since its inception, regardless of risk. That day may never be too late, but the longer you wait, the less your returns and growth are likely to be.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:52:01
What it means for investors as in, long-term-don't-give-a-fuck-about-dips-holders?
Not a damn thing! You'll see more volatility, but you'll also see a lot more volume. Even if it were to dip to 5k, as long as you don't panic and stay true to holding, it will probably be fine, bouncing back to not only 15k, but 20k and beyond. 2018 is likely to finish much higher than 2017, regardless of what occurs in the short-term.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:24:17
Not probable. Notice how the crashes don't last very long anymore?
You said you bought around 16.5? It's been what, two, three days? Get through December without panic selling, and you'll probably be happy. Hold until 2022 and I firmly believe 100 bucks today will grow into 3000-5000 ish. Not much right, but that's if you didn't buy anymore at all.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:33:00

I know this sounds dangerously naive, but I almost think it doesn't even matter whether bitcoin evolves to solve any problems on its own. Other cryptos can do that.
Staying with the precious metals analogy, you have many other metals that can do things better than gold (or at least, much more inexpensively). So those metals will be used for the majority of applications. This isn't to say gold isn't exceptional in some cases, because it is, but even then it's use is uncommon or small enough to ignore the premium rate. And you even have rarer metals like platinum and palladium that should be worth more on paper or even as jewelry, yet today, they are worth less.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:37:55
Would you be taxed even if you sold for Tether and waited on the sidelines?
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:49:56
That's a bingo.
Gold's present marketcap is &gt; 7 trillion. And that's with another (unspecified) amount to be mined over the next few decades at least. That's with a giant volume being bought and sold, and it's more or less in line with actual gold mining, refining, and processing costs. Its value arguably supported by those costs and, obviously, by everyone else believing their precious, rare metal is valuable should they ever choose to sell it. This exists in bitcoin too, just with a few exceptional qualities:
Bitcoin has a known, scarcer quantity, and its own production costs will only increase over time and with scarcity/difficulty. It will explode in demand (and price, naturally) as more people want it just as a store-of-value kinda commodity. One that's more liquid than gold and arguably more secure if you take the time to learn what you're doing. Now, if it does what some people like Steve Wozniak are hoping for in replacing fiat altogether as a global currency, then the price and demand doesn't just explode ... it becomes something else entirely.
**It would be like Neo asking, "What are you trying to tell me? That I can sell my bitcoin for fiat then buy lambos?" And Morpheus replying, "No, Neo. I'm trying to tell you that when its ready, you** ***won't have*** ***to."***
In that scenario the dollar will be so inflated and worthless that a bitcoin will be worth a ridiculous amount of dollars. In that scenario, people who have held fiat over the years leading up to it will be the true bagholders, wanting to get a piece of the bitcoin pie lest they get left behind completely. Some of the fiat-richest people in the world won't care about their losses, and buy bitcoin anyway. But most of the fiat-richest people in the world, will already have secured their place with bitcoin far before this reckoning. I really think ETFs will pave the way for such an influx. A transfer of wealth.
But diversify. Out of crypto, too. Land is just as scarce for instance. Good luck out there.

According to Warren's logic, there should be \(and would be\) a lot of people upset if the US Dollar, or the national debt, were criticized.
He fails to acknowledge the percentage of people invested in bitcoin who *likewise* don't care about its price going up or down and will hold no matter what. Sure there are people who jumped on board due to speculation, but guess what's provided this day in age? Access to information and learning what you're getting into at a much quicker pace than what was previously available during his prime.
Also ignored is bitcoin's store of value property; it's arguably more rare and more liquid than gold and, even if its valuation is derived from methods similar to fiat, so what? As long as there is demand, then the money spent in purchasing any denomination of bitcoin is not only inherently retained, but can be expected to go up if you are an early adopter of such liquidity.
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:23:47
Isn't the volume being "traded" on exchanges like a small fraction of the total supply? I think if the majority of bitcoin owners are holding, these pivotal movements \(including downward\) are a good sign. When the real volume picks up again from new investors/money, it's pretty clear what can happen because we've seen it before.

Hold, but in the sense of not checking price. If you focus on things like using it and ignore volatility, your overall belief (and long-term faith) should pay off in spades. I'd call that beating the volatility.
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:41:56
All I know is if you were someone who got in near the ATHs, it'd be downright silly to "cut your losses" if you're like 90&amp; of people who do so... they never buy back in. Then when the market picks back up and surpasses previous ATHs that's when you're actually wrecked.
Everyone talks about buying back in lower if they sell at a loss, but they forget all the stories about the people who accidentally woke up rich because they didn't touch bitcoin for a couple of years. Holding works, and if the downswings are that troublesome then you've invested more than you're okay with losing. And likely forgetting you didn't really lose your crypto stash until you convert it back to fiat, either.

Tech is the equalizer here.

But energy may become so affordable one day that none of that will matter.

The point he was making was the moon landing analogy and space travel is apples/oranges. At least with the way you've presented it.
You've both suggested that you think 10k is the moon, but that it also hasn't peaked. So the room you're leaving is supposed be analogous to space travel that humans have yet to achieve? But then you leave room for drones. If bitcoin blows past 20k and 50k, will you next say but, but rovers! Cassini! Not to mention you took quite the leap from that 10k moon to 1 million.
Whatever platform you depict bitcoin riding "to the moon" in, space shuttle, or unmanned drone, just stay in the same one. I'm pretty sure it's going beyond your predicted moon, and that milestone will surpass what we've done with manned missions...

Smart move. I'm almost in the same boat, and while the logic is sound there's something to be said about using not "hard-earned" capital necessarily, but fairly easily-earned capital, akin to winning the lottery. Also I stumbled across this article by Dave Ramsey at   .... where a quote stood out to me:
**"If I’m wrong and you wake up next spring and you hate having your house paid for and no money in your brokerage account, go get you a mortgage. You can always undo this. When you pay off your house and burn the mortgage, take off your shoes and walk through the backyard. The grass feels different under your feet. The borrower is slave to the lender is deeper than just a mathematical discussion. It frees you up in places you don’t even know you’re stressed in until you don’t have the stress anymore."**

Good. But people need to believe in the tech more than anything.
If you think about it, you can replace the name we've ascribed to it (bitcoin), for just about anything else. Blockchain Bucks. Digital Dollars. Whatever, right? And at the end of the day you still have this very early adoption period of a technology that certainly seems like it's not only here to stay, but will also only get increasingly adopted over time.
We're in that premature stage where we can convert our fiat into this technology at a rate that will most likely be much more inexpensive than those jumping on board later in the game.
The supply/demand economics of this revolutionary technology make it pretty easy to see what can and probably will happen. Cheers.

Definitely a babo then.
Because it's 100% hilarious how you don't see the price (relatively speaking) is irrelevant. 1 BTC = 1 BTC. When someone buys it at 1k or buys it at 100k, they are simply parking their money into a new, technologically-backed and sound asset class.
Your fiat gets converted into the BTC and, as an early adopter, it's probably going to be at a steal compared to what the landscape will likely be in a few years if demand (and holding) continues to increase.
More people are going to want to park their fiat into this finite space. Not just to "make money" or jump on a bandwagon, but due to the realization of why many including institutional investors, have even bothered buying any in the first place. It's a mass transfer of wealth. Converting your constantly-printable, inflationary fiat into a digital, secure asset that is not only anti-inflationary, but can suddenly be sent to someone at the furthest part of the Earth without any outrageous wire transfer fees let alone government intervention. It is more liquid than gold, a hedge against inflation, and at this pace will continue to be more sought after as time goes on.
Some of ya'll keep laughing about bitcoin bags, but you're going to be the ones holding the heaviest fiat bags in the end, likely at a time when 1 BTC will be able to buy all of them.

First mover advantage. Bitcoin is often referred to as digital gold. "Better" may come along, may already be here, but for now it doesn't matter because of dominance/adoption.
Gold is worth a poop ton in the scheme of things. Silver, less. Now the most liquid coins are even more inexpensive metals or alloys. Yet gold is rarer and valued as such because it's still liquid and in demand for more reasons than just currency. Store of value on top of it all, as you said.
Even if someone came along and minted a handful of rhodium coins, they'd technically be worth more due to scarcity, but probably much harder to move.
Bitcoin borrows from more than one sector and digital gold is accurate, IMO. Its first mover advantage here against every other alt coin (and every other alt-crypto store of value) is tremendous. Keep an eye on its dominance though, because who knows.
