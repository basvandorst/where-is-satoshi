You're weak AF. Go live your life for a month and come back. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:47:46
Did you sell your btc because you don't like coinbase? Or simply move them off of their exchange. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:42:33
Only if you can tell the future.
For now, just buy it while it falls. Buy the dips. This will lower your overall average buy in price. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:36
I caught at 15k. Then at 13.8k. Just keep catching.

I felt the 1.0 club slipping through my fingers when we were there about 5800, so I bought the last chunk needed to reach it at all costs. No regrets.

People screw things up. Bitcoin meanwhile, is working perfectly.
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:17:33
The fact that the one of those entities would make their 'bitcoin' makes it not Bitcoin.

He doesn't hold that Bitcoin. It gets settled to USD immediately. But yes, he is just another goon and happens to have a gold business - he'd be shooting himself in the foot to support Bitcoin.

Coinbase. But the fact that you're asking that question and want to buy 5 coins is a bad mix IMHO
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:26:49
Great response - thank you. I had mentioned the age/risk ratio in my reply email to him to remind him of why I personally am going after it more aggressively than he might like me to. Had to remind him I'm still young!

If you buy with a credit card in coinbase you get it right away. If you fund it from a checking account it takes a week or so. You buy it at whatever the price is currently, it just doesn't hit your account until later.

Vote skewing aside, Reddit mostly rise's upvoted stuff to the top, if memes get to the top, people wanted them there. Flagging posts as memes so people can filter them is an option, but if people feel like the sub is mostly memes and not enough meaningful discussion I urge you to hang out in 'new' and 'rising' areas for this sub and vote early on posts and join in on the more serious posts that don't go on to become more visible on this sub. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:29:37

You think I haven't already? I just keep enough in my checking to pay for the immediate future. People say not to go all in, but I'm only 28 and can take a hit if it all crashes, which is pretty hard to imagine at this point.
@_date: 2019-04-10 17:37:11
I haven't added them all up, but yeah, maybe like 400-500k Bitcoin.

Back in late 2014 coinbase was giving 1USD worth of Bitcoin if you opened an account, so I did. Forgot about it. I checked it a few more than ago and it was worth like 5USD when btc was at 2700. That's what got me hooked.

moved everything to my ledger nano s last week, i feel so much better about my coins now. i'd say to anyone reading this who keeps their money on coinbase/other exchanges, buy a hardware wallet if you have even only a couple hundred dollars in coins. might seem unnecessary to buy a ~100USD wallet for only a couple hundred in coins, but you need to think of your coins in their future value.

And yet they are the best exchange to send someone to that is brand new to bitcoin. That's the trade off. They're the Apple of bitcoin exchanges. Nice interface, but you pay a premium. It's worth it for that purpose to help adoption.
