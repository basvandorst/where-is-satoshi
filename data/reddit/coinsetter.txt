We hadn't thought of this idea previously - thanks for the suggestion! If there is a lot of customer demand for this feature, we may offer it in the future.

We are referring the fact that the entire chain is linked to accounting balances, but those balances aren't linked to actual assets. Maxwell's system is a solution that verifies an exchange's liabilities but doesn't verify its assets. Therefore, an exchange would have to prove that it has the assets (i.e. bitcoins or USD) separately, possibly through signing messages with private keys or some other method. I'd love to hear thoughts on if the Maxwell methodology is thought to be sufficient for tracking exchange liabilities, as well as any ideas you and others have on proving asset ownership.

Hey Cubicle Jockey,
Although I can see why you would highlight this concern, Ticketometer was discontinued in mid 2012 and hasn't operated for over a year and a half. Coinsetter on the other hand is growing, active and secure. You can read about our security practices at the link below, and we're happy to answer any specific questions you have/get your feedback at wecare

Thanks, noted!
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:07:06
This is something we have put thought into. It's very interesting and likely will be created by someone in the future, but it is extremely hard to implement without progress made in multisig wallet development. For example, if you place an out-of-market limit order on the exchange, you shouldn't be able to send that amount of bitcoins from the wallet until that order is canceled.
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:31:33
Hey all, we're excited about our new rebate program and are here to answer any questions you have about it. Feel free to reach out to us at wecare

These are great ideas. Thanks guys!

Hey all, thanks for following us. I agree that today wasn't our best appearance, and it can be difficult to speak in great depth on a five minute news segment. While I believe in the message we conveyed on bitcoin's present and future, we'll work on communicating this in a clearer way going forward.
In regards to security, I very strongly stand behind my position. Bitcoin is still not easy for the average consumer to use, and I encourage developers to continue building creative apps that can bring bitcoin to the masses. This is a priority for us at Coinsetter.

@_date: 2014-03-17 16:18:17
Thanks for this. I appreciate you commenting on bitcoin's security and usability from a mainstream consumer perspective. Most people using bitcoin today do not understand bitcoin security, and as someone who uses bitcoin daily, it is easy to forget about some of its drawbacks/challenges. I am very passionate about making bitcoin safer to use and feel we shouldn't ignore the ways in which we can make bitcoin better for the non-technical user.
@_date: 2014-08-13 19:44:06
Good news - this is now available to most US customers!
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:40:35

Thanks for your patience despite the difficult US regulatory climate, and we expect to bring this functionality to you by year end.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:47:51
Absolutely. The situation was a bit overwhelming and caught me off guard at points. I believe that if most of the people on this forum commenting on my poor performance met me and had a conversation about bitcoin, though, they would be excited that I'm leading an exchange. I strongly stand behind what we're doing at Coinsetter.

We are not presently licensed, though we are federally registered as an MSB. This is a complex topic, but it is our intention to be a fully-regulated exchange in states where our customers are primarily located (New York, California, Illinois, etc.) as licenses become available. 
This is something that is being worked on behind the scenes right now but will take more time.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:04:36

I started Coinsetter in November 2012 when bitcoin was a very different place. I still love bitcoin for some of the "libertarian" reasons that appealed to me when I came into it, but my views on the space are much deeper and complex than they were originally.

I am basically only passionate about products focused on remittances right now. That market is served primarily through Bitcoin ATMs and wallets. That is the "low hanging fruit" to disrupt, and every other market (credit card processing and bank transfers) will be much more challenging. Fortunately, the remittance industry is a $500 billion market.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:21:38
People should ask them which bank is supporting them on this. Until it's actually in the market, it's not real.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:33:50
It's easier to provide a reliable product without external dependencies. The Bitstamp team is a group of solid guys, so it has nothing to do with them personally or even the hack really. We can just make our order book more reliable by not aggregating third party market data.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:05:27
We have a group of awesome market makers and traders who have stepped up to the challenge. We also introduced new $100 and $500 trading credits to allow people to trade successfully despite the reduced volume. 
I expect order book depth and trading volume to be back to normal in 6-8 weeks, but with no external dependencies.
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:38:30
This was answered elsewhere, so check out the other posts.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:14:50
Good question. It takes a lot of time to build a business, and a lot of the largest exchanges have been open in the market for 3 years. I'm confident we'll get there.
PS: I don't think foreign exchanges "go away"... They serve a different customer segment of the market.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:06:19
Not that we're aware of.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:13:07
We're not afraid of competition. We have built an insanely awesome product, and I don't think they could compete with it anytime soon. Anyone looking to trade bitcoin on a truly high performance, institutional-class system should try it out.

1. It has attracted multiple hedge funds to our exchange.
2. We don't have negative feeling about the BitLicense, we just hope for a licensing path to open up so we can offer domestic US bank transfers to our customers.

A list of our unique features is listed on this very AMA. Here are a few of them.

- Fast customer support
- Openness, you can meet me in person
@_date: 2015-01-09 17:39:51
Since Coinsetter uses Sparkasse Bank Malta, we thought we would clarify one aspect of this. The issue is related to a specific branch of Sparkasse Bank in Germany and does not affect Sparkasse Bank Malta.
@_date: 2015-01-23 17:04:24
I find it funny that the whole AMA would be a waste of time just because we didn't answer your question, but I'll answer it anyway...
We are still a pretty new exchange. We didn't open our doors until August 2014, and it takes time to grow a business. We have also learned a lot about what our customers want since then, which took additional time to incorporate into our product. I can confidently say that as of January 2015 I am extremely happy with the product we offer to the market.
We don't have the limitations on jurisdictions that you are referring to.
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:23:28
If we're not aggregated into a forex ECN by this time next year, I would be very surprised...
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:10:11
We had a meeting with their group in late 2013. We do our best to prepare for licenses when they come out, but we don't have a lot of clarity on when that will be. Hopefully soon so we can have certainty on the requirements and open up US bank transfers to our customers in New York State.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:02:29
That is me (Jaron), glad you're liking them!
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:09:33
We do monthly balance reconciliations internally right now. We do plan to offer results publicly at some point in the near future - probably after our first third party audit.
@_date: 2015-01-23 15:18:31
We use the term "institutional" but are really referring to our technology. If you looked behind the scenes of our exchange, you would find a properly constructed platform built by low latency trading system developers. It took us over a year and a half to build it. Any company that takes less time than that probably has a very buggy product. Things we offer that are unique include:
- Millisecond latency trading
- Institutional FIX API
- Very solid WebSockets and REST APIs
- High uptime
- Compliance approved bank accounts
- Fast customer support
- Openness, you can meet me in person
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:30:55
Regulation is a hurdle that definitely makes this a challenging business to be in, but I wouldn't say it impacts our competitiveness versus other exchanges.

We offer pro trader/institutional technology to all people that are actively buying, selling and trading bitcoin. There's no reason to trade bitcoin on a system with inferior technology (unless you require margin, in which case Bitfinex is the place to go).
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:26:41
If you're having a good experience with them, you should stick with those exchanges. Jesse is a good guy!
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:22:00
Bitfinex is awesome - they're crushing it. We have also done pretty great volumes ourselves. We're rebuilding a bit after removing Bitstamp from our order book, but we'll get back there. We're working hard to bring more market makers online, many of whom are developing to our API right now.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:52:14
Yes true. We'll need to change that wording.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:16:50
This has been answered elsewhere. I don't think any answer I could give on Reddit could sufficiently explain this complex topic. But I can say it's a high priority for me.

Our international bank has requested that we don't make public announcements our relationship.

Running a bitcoin exchange has potential liabilities if people misuse it, so you might call us overprotective on this. I know it's an issue for some people and definitely understand reservations some people have.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:29:01
This sounds like a pretty limited view of the tech stack to me...

@_date: 2015-01-23 18:24:17
No, I'm a healthy dude.
@_date: 2015-01-23 18:17:45
This isn't a problem on our exchange, since we require users to designate one bitcoin address in their personal wallet to send bitcoins to. Our users send bitcoins to themselves. This has an important security benefit, since even if someone hacked into your account, they could never send bitcoins to anyone besides you.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:27:29
It takes approximately 3-5x longer than you think it will.
So in our case, it took us about a year and a half to build. These are very complex systems, and while the common thought in tech these days is to get out to the market quickly, that's pretty hard to do with an enterprise product. People trade real money on our exchange, and these products need to be extremely reliable.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:07:46
For bitcoin to become truly interest to institutional players (i.e. large hedge funds and banks), there needs to be substantially more non-speculative usage of bitcoin.
Bitcoin ATMs are, in my view, the vertical of our industry that will make this happen over the next two years. As more remittances are sent over the bitcoin network through Bitcoin ATMs, both daily trading volume and the bitcoin price will rise.
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:17:18
Exactly. The important question is whether $250,000 FDIC coverage applies to every customer separately or customers as a whole.
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:00:30
Yes we are definitely considering that, as well as Stellar and Tether. No decisions have been made yet as to how we'll proceed, so it's probably more of a 2H 2015 item for us.

I tried figuring that out early on in my bitcoin days too – overly difficult. You should skip the hassle and try Coinbase (assuming you're located in the US).
@_date: 2012-12-13 20:18:45
This is an interesting idea, but I see an issue in that the currency exchange kiosks at the airport pretty much have the same business model as any other bitcoin or currency exchange (i.e. they hold or have access to multiple currencies and charge a fee/aggressive conversion rate for accepting currency A and giving you currency B). They are just able to charge higher rates because they're conveniently located at the airport. I feel that bitcoin has more potential to undercut credit card companies than the currency exchange market.

ECN-style platform refers to the fact that Coinsetter is not just an exchange, but a platform that aggregates multiple exchanges to offer deep liquidity. We will launch with both Bitstamp and Coinsetter's own high performance exchange, and we plan on adding more exchanges over the coming months.

Hey danperegrine, you're probably right about that. However, feel free to get in touch with us via the contact form on our landing page, and we'll soon replace it with a beta site that I think you'll really like. You can also see some screenshots of what we're building at the links above.

Thanks for the question. One of the biggest challenges we've faced as a company has been operating legally while still getting into the market quickly. A big first accomplishment we have made on this is finding a US bank that would partner with our company. That took months to achieve, but we were successful on it recently. We are now working on a strategy that will allow us to accept deposits from US customers, which I am hoping to offer in the next 6-8 weeks. Being able to offer ACH deposits to you is a huge goal of mine right now.
@_date: 2013-11-21 04:47:47
This is a really important point that is worth open discussion from our end. I agree that personal privacy is very important. I guarantee that we will never sell your social security number or personal information. In addition, we take strong measures to maintain the security of your personal data, in addition to the bitcoins you hold with us.
While I know that this is not ideal to some users, we obtain this information in order to be certain that we know who our customers are and make sure that our platform is not being abused as a center for money laundering and other illicit purposes. By collecting this information and holding it securely, we believe we can become an important US financial institution that shares your belief in bitcoin and its ability to make the world a freer place.

You're right. This vision is from a bit of a futurist perspective, but it's something I see really clearly and strongly believe in. We at Coinsetter are working hard to build what will become the liquidity backbone of the ecosystem that will make it all possible. But there are so many other businesses just waiting to be built on top of bitcoin, and a lot of people don't see what they are yet. I'm going to start writing more on the topic, and I really encourage other entrepreneurs to come in and build businesses that enable fiat-to-fiat global payments over the bitcoin network. I invite everyone to reach out to me personally if you ever need help.

I usually shy away from making commercial posts on Reddit, but we're going to be launching a leveraged forex trading platform for bitcoin next month called Coinsetter. We're a US-based company, and I guarantee that we're going to be unmatched in terms of quality and transparency. You can join our beta launch at 
@_date: 2013-05-08 14:58:03

@_date: 2013-09-24 18:05:47
I agree, the world has changed a lot since we first announced our investment earlier this year, and we have had to change along with it. We haven't rushed to launch a mediocre product, and we have been laser-focused on legal aspects of our business to make sure our customers are working with a company that will be here for the long run. I can promise that the wait will be worth it. Thanks for being patient with us!
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:10:15
Hey Chris, thanks for the enthusiasm for our launch! Most of our platform is built at this point, and we are now in the final phases of connecting the different parts of our system together. We will launch internally and be testing our own platform very soon. The pieces we have built already (our matching engine, for example) are functioning well by themselves and are extremely high performance.
As you have probably read, there are new regulatory hurdles that we and all Bitcoin companies are working to comply with in the US. We are spending a lot of time with our legal advisors to make sure we are operating legally in every state and produce a plan that lets us get to market as soon as possible. You should expect us to launch with coverage for a limited number of states and international customers at the end of this month and over the month of August. We will also be purely focused on providing a high performance trading platform that aggregates the feeds of multiple exchanges in addition to our own millisecond trading platform, leaving the launch of leverage and shorting to later this year. There really isn't a reliable way to trade Bitcoin yet in general, and I feel that this is an essential need in the market right now.
Hope this gives you some insight on our path forward, and feel free to email us directly with any questions.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:08:06

Hey zeroblock (and everyone), I just wanted to give some color on this in my own words. We often use the words "trading platform" when referring to our company, but a better way to think about us is that we're an ECN-style exchange that aggregates the liquidity of other exchanges. At launch we will aggregate Bitstamp and our own internal millisecond exchange, adding other exchanges over the coming months. We just went into a friends and family beta, and we're aiming to open up to real customers in September. I really appreciate you all mentioning us in this post, and I'm really happy with the quality of the product we've built. We won't let you down!

Hey guys, thanks for bringing this up. You're right that as of today, the liquidity is fairly low. But within the next few weeks, we will be launching our integration of Bitstamp's order book, which means you will have not only the liquidity available on our exchange but that of Bitstamp as well.
@_date: 2013-09-24 18:56:53
We will have our own order book, on top of being a meta-exchange. We're not making our US timeline public yet, but it's very promising.
@_date: 2013-05-30 21:40:39
Hey all, we're working to bring our platform to market as soon as possible. The most important thing is that we deliver on our promises of quality and not launch something before our platform is ready. Our capital raise has allowed us to hire a lot of developers with deep Wall Street experience, and we're building something that is better than I ever could have imagined even three months ago. Quality development takes time, and I promise that when we do launch, we won't let you down. Thanks for being patient, as tough as it is (for us too!)

Hey all, thanks for posting about Coinsetter! Just thought I would give you the "inside scoop" on our launch. We will be launching live trading to international customers in the next few weeks. I'm excited to say that we have secured a compliance-approved bank account to ensure that our customers' funds are kept safe and accessible. On the U.S. front, which is important since we are based in NYC, we are in talks on a partnership that will allow us to open up in all 50 states. More to come on that later.

In the near term, our value proposition over Mt Gox is 1) we offer leverage to users (more info on that in the bitcointalk forum), 2) our platform is enjoyable to use, and 3) we're going to have the best API on the market. 
We don't operate differently from Mt Gox in terms of single-currency access, and during beta, all of our trades will be run through their exchange. We currently provide the same trades as Mt Gox, but with leverage and a user-friendly interface. We will release our own exchange in the near future but will continue to focus on providing customers with the best prices on the market. To clarify, loans will be available in both USD and BTC depending on the trading position you take (long or short).
On the legal side, we are and will remain in compliance with all U.S. laws. The benefit to using Coinsetter is that we are working to provide a transparent, best-in-class platform that has users in mind. More over, traders who want leverage will be able to accomplish their trading strategies more effectively with us. We have already received quite a few positive emails from bitcoin traders who are excited about our platform, and my goal is to work with them during our beta period (and beyond) to build the best bitcoin trading platform on the market.

Hey all, just thought I'd reach out and give you some insight on our launch plans. We're going to launch to the first 100 people that subscribed to our beta in late July, continuing to open things up in the same order after that. Our initial focus will be on exchange aggregation and unlevered high performance trading. It's all about offering a reliable place to trade Bitcoin that people can count on. We'll then layer on leverage and shorting later this year.
Thanks everyone for the excitement you have been showing for our platform! Jaron
