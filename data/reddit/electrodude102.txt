I have a circle account, I'm having issues verifying my bank and they won't let me make a deposit until someone manually checks over my account (fraud prevention stuff) so I have to just sit and cry at the low prices.
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:03:47
I would explain it like this (ELI5). Bitcoin is much like a pre-paid gift card where the account number is your "bitcoin-wallet" (there is no physical card). The "bank" is the blockchain, a transparent-ledger agreed upon by all the users. You can cash in/out at a "bitcoin-exchange"(stock-market) where the coin is bought/sold to a bidder. bitcoin may be spent anywhere that excepts this form of payment.
bitcoin can be stolen if a person was able to find the private-key to a wallet (the pin number to the prepaid card)

I'm just here to complain, kinda off topic.
I'm still trying to get verified on Circle, signed up in ~November, uploaded docs, waited for micro deposits, they never arrived, account was locked to make sure I'm not a fraud(?), contacted support  was told to re submit my docs, nothing happened, contacted me, had me re-submit my docs (again), now I'm waiting on the micro payments to confirm my bank, again. would have bought at $195 if this whole thing hadn't happened. My $100 isn't going to be worth any coin by the time I'm able to deposit UGH. also coinbase isn't available in my state :/

who really cares if an exchange is fully licensed? yay taxes?! I mean, I guess its good that your coin will be backed by usd fiat (cause you know banks never crash :/), why trust your coin to an exchange when you can keep it safely in your own hands. (educate me pls)
@_date: 2015-01-22 01:59:22
any suggestions on where to go?
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:18:15

Well, checks are tied to your bank account which requires vast amounts of personal information to open, and is trackable, and will be slammed with fees etc.
Bitcoin rbf tx are more like gift cards, which are surrendered upon use, and not swiped until 10mins (to several hours) later, and may actually be empty. Thus you havent paid until its confirmed.
I can see how rbf could be useful, but its also exploitable. I feel like its a good idea but we aren't ready for it yet. (like how the doritos-taco campaign failed in the 70s, but is super poupular now XD)
@_date: 2016-01-17 03:10:17
Why did the coins never exist, I thought he mined them himself...
@_date: 2017-08-01 21:35:10
they only had support for 3d party usd withdrawls, so like a money-gram or whatever and it takes a week or two to process/arrive. tbh you are better off withdrawing coins and selling them locally or through a regulated exchange.
technically, they could pay the 110M fine and become regulated (probably not) then i dont know.

satoshi is the creator of btc, he has a stash of like 1,000,000btc from the Genesis block(or whatever) that have never been moved/touched. Someone is pretending to move them, probably in hopes to make everyone dump there own coins; becuase, 1mil btc falling into the marked would severely change the price.

I have a circle account, it was kind of a pain to verify my account initially, but I have never had any real issues; given I don't frequently transfer *large* amounts of money. $50 transactions are indeed instant and I immediately move funds to a local wallet. I have never spent from circle directly.
@_date: 2015-08-04 21:47:47


so blockchain.info is just a fancy GUI for the network, it just displays information fed to it, and currently doesn't validate the signatures on transactions, thus, not removing the invalid ones. It's only a spoof on the GUI front, and no coins are actually moved. I wouldn't really consider it "compromised", its just not filtering out the invalid stuff, if that makes sense.
this shouldn't mean anything for wallet holders as your coins are still intact.
**tl;dr.** its like trying to cash a voided check, its still a check that says $500, but the bank wont accept it, and the funds may or may not exist. 
note: same disclaimer, i'm a noob correct me if wrong, please.
note just fyi "blockchain.info"(GUI) is not "the blockchain"(network).

You bought 5, holy crap! Price jumping/falling is normal, it's been everywhere between $200-$300 since January, but it has spiked to 1k as mentioned, in the past. lots of people are *in it for the long run* which means they will hold on to their coins for 5-10+ years in hopes they will be worth several thousand dollars each. (ignoring the 1k spike-crash, bitcoin has been steadily increasing in value over the years), sadly I'll  probably end up withdrawing mine way before that happens, because rent, but whatever. I usually keep [bitstamp open in a tab]( so I can keep an eye on it. and yup that was me, thanks for the kind words :)

Am I the only one that thinks bitcoin will be surpassed? I'm sure it will be huge in years to come, probably the main currency for a while, but Bitcoin now is an infant. I am 100% sure it will be completely replaced before we mine 21mth coin (due to moores law). (i mean it will still be used, someone will mine that coin/satoshi, but by then "we" will have migrated to a newer, *Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger, More Than Hour*, oops, a new currency.
