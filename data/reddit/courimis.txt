Simply because Morgan Stanley deals over the counter with financial institutions, an ETF is a security listed on a market and anybody can buy it as opposed to the MS derivative product

Man what a toxic community over there. I am not a huge fan of Bitcoin (33% weight in my portfolio and not what I consider the most interesting part), however over there 50% of the posts are about /rbitcoin and how shitty bitcoin "core" is and how uneducated other people are. Anyway I'm relatively new to cryptos, joined many communities in Reddit, /rbtc is the only sub I unsubscribed from due to high toxicity...

I perfectly agree with you, ultimately it should be the ETF provider and the broker giving access to that ETF that should give the investors the proper warnings. It is the investor's responsability to understand the risks associated with the security they wish to purchase, the SEC to give general guidelines and the ETF provider/ broker to provide investors with clear information.

My take is that if they have to stoop this low, they will be soon out of arguments. Not that I think that the ETF is what will drive a long term adoption, but it would be great to just get over with it

The SEC has in mind the adequacy of the product with those who can buy it. The SEC considers that given ETFs are regulated by them, if they approve one and retail investors suffer heavy losses, they would be held responsible for that. However, since this derivative product will be available only to financial institutions over the counter, that doesn't fall under the SEC responsibilities.  
Edit: I am not addressing the point of whether having more derivatives is a good or bad thing. My personal opinion is that the more instruments traded on bitcoin / cryptos; the more legitimy and liquidity they will have which is ultimately a good thing. I do understand the flip sides but they are true of any asset and if the value proposition of cryptos doesn't grow outside of "store of value", they will deserve what they will get pricewise

These derivatives are available on every single major asset class and for decades. My point is, picking gold and predicting a similar story is not relevant.

I get your point, crowdsourcing comments is a reasonable thing to do, however I still don't get what they might expect by asking if the price will be out of reach.

this comment is not high enough. Spot on man

I was wondering about the second part of applauding :D

Banks all found "respected" scholars to certify that their products are Sharia compliant. I'm no specialist but just wanted to bring a nuance to your initial comment.

they know for sure, the IT guy will have to expense your fee to the finance department that will require all the details about how the payment has been made, beneficiary etc... Most likely it was the finance departement that took care of arranging the payment. This is coming from someone working in an investment bank

This is a misconception; I would invite you to look up the Sharia Compliant structured products market which is quite important in the UAE and Saudi Arabia. Many banks offer these (JP Morgan, Citibank, Societe Generale, BNP) and very soon the one I'm working for. Cheers

To express concern over valid points is one thing, but to request comment on whether retail investors have the means to buy a share of the ETF worth 25 bitcoins is in my opinion pure trolling. We are beyond babysitting!
