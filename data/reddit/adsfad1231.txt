maybe not.. but when it shot up in dec/jan they had to stop signups on most exchanges and sell off some of mtgox's stash to get the price back down.. could happen again, I suppose but if not it could  fomo even higher.

You don't need a static IP to listen on a port.. it just means they don't guarantee that they won't change your IP sometimes, but that's irrelevant. Here's a [video]( of someone forwarding a port on bell..

Berkeley DB is just for the wallet keystore.. it uses leveldb for the actual blockchain database :p

imo there won't be one

sounds legit!

Less than half based on BCH movement since the fork.. counting satoshis wallet (which imo is not lost) it'd be less than 45% that is potentially lost.. maybe half that down to 23% for a finger in the air guess.. but it could be less than that.. maybe even less than 10% lost.

You could use tor or a vpn or satellite to try and reach other nodes.. by default though they can certainly reject your transactions if they want (or just disconnect you from the internet?).. if they block your transactions you'll figure it out fairly quickly and probably connect to a different network.. 
maybe they could trick you into thinking you received funds by mining a slightly less than 50% attack and feeding it to you on all the nodes you think you're connected too.. that's probably the worst they could do.. but it would still require a significant mining effort in addition to the mitm.

Yea.. I guess a zeroconf + mitm attack would work pretty well.. maybe the seller spoofs the starbucks wifi (or arp poisons the default gateway on the real one) and tricks the customer into connecting to it.. then the customer forks over cash for an unconfirmed transaction that was never broadcast to anyone but him and has already been spent on the real network.

Interesting.. and basically proof that exchanges are extending credits of fake btc to some customers somehow.

sidechains and ln will sort it out.. there won't be any significant increase imo.

maybe we could see a significant ramp up in drone based cross border smuggling, financed by crypto payments :p not sure if drones can be made to carry steel efficiently enough though.
