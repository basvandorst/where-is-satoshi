I also thought about this option.  It appears attractive because I would still be making a large dent in my debt, while keeping myself in the game long term for bitcoin.  It seems like a good hedge because whichever way bitcoin goes, I win.

My assumption is coinbase directly into my bank account.

When I first heard about bitcoins they were not accepted by anyone, and really still just a concept.  But I thought it was such a great idea that I kept tracking it and eventually bought some.
So I know very well that the value is all over the place.  But it seems to becoming more widely adopted.  If that adoption continues then keeping some of the coins will really pay off in the future.  But being debt free would change my life in a meaningful way right now. I've been pondering this for a while because I thought "in a few years, this day may come." But suddenly it's that day, two years sooner than I would have thought possible.

Hi, thanks for having a sense of humour about it.  I tend to reach out to many different resources for advice, thoughts, and comments.  Reddit is just one of those.  It's very interesting to hear different points of view and sometimes a completely new one.  It's all food for thought.

Quite a few finance sites are using the Open F2 container framework now for things like tickers and charts.  Have you considered this as an option so that maybe you could license your charts to others?

Ah, I see.  But my house, accounts, life are not in Puerto Rico so I don't think this is an option.

I already max out the 401k each year.  Definitely thinking along these lines though.

I don't get that reference.

My car is not fancy, and has only about 1 BTC outstanding (assuming rate around 800USD).

I understand your point.  My payments are very easy for me to meet at the moment, there are certainly no money problems here even without any bitcoin on hand.
