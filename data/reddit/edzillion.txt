It still seems ridiculously easy to move the market right now. I would say it would be relatively cheap (if you picked the right day) to move the market in a certain direction for the best part of 24hrs.

I noticed the thread on bitcoin.org and read it, and while a lot of the technicalities are hard to understand, I get the impression that this idea has a lot of promise. Unfortunately I haven't seen any explanation of how this would work in practice.

It's way over the 30 day moving average, don't even start with the 100 day. I am loathe to use analysis that is based around the behaviour of more traditional markets but it is fairly logical to assume that the recent run up in prices will (at some stage) attract more sellers to the market - which will depress prices.
My personal view, though I haven't been watching the market for too long, is that the price should be around .80c -&gt; $1.20.

I've been noticing this all day. very strange range-bound trading between about 19.60 to 20. Just heard about the fact that dark pools can trade on the open market on a thread on bitcoin.org - which is very strange when compared to other markets.
Are you sure this is the case though? I am looking at the charts and the candles are stopping at 20, they are stopping at anywhere from 19.90 to 20, so there is some movement in the dark pool asks?
@_date: 2011-06-20 02:32:23
But that means that this attack wouldn't work. It's a good exchange - it is probably the most above-board of the exchanges out there - but it is a different type of exchange since you don't trade with the exchange directly, you trade with other users, and that has it's own security implications.

@_date: 2011-04-22 23:22:23
You know, I hadn't thought of it like that. I have a general philosophy of treating people as if they are as intelligent as me, which of course can not be true in all cases but I find that being optimistic about a persons ability to understand you has generally good results. 
Of course I agree that there are dangers in coming across like a pyramid scheme seller, or encouraging others to do so, but I have noticed that the bitcoin community, being made up of a lot of technology freaks and tinkerers is highly skewed toward the the more thoughtful and intelligent range of the human condition.
What I am saying is that we can and should be advocating bitcoin in a here-are-the-facts take-it-or-leave-it way. It seems to be that there are many people who will be interested in the information but not see the real potential in bitcoin and therefore not have much enthusiasm for it. For the foreseeable future it will be useless for day-to-day transactions and that rules out anyone who is not a tech freak of some kind. The people we want to attract are the people that are like us, which is why I have more hope in reddit than most places. One interesting thing to note is that it seems to attract the right wing libertarians (anti-federal reserve, anti-government) and the left liberals (pro credit union, cooperatives etc.) in fairly equal measure.
Here is my suggested elevator pitch for bitcoin: 


That statement isn't necessarily all 100% accurate but it might be a spur for some questions that can help clarify things.

I was thinking about what would happen and I decided that, counter intuitively, it looks like BTC will rise in price (at least at first). This is because many are in the same boat as you (myself included) and want BTC not $s. [I did a poll on bitcoin.org:](
 
**If you are leaving mt gox, how will you withdraw your funds? (cash or btc)?**
* I will take cash 	- 4 (10.3%)
* I will take bitcoins 	- 35 (89.7%)

Apologies for that, glad you liked the change.
@_date: 2011-04-29 09:23:05
I accept that due to the anonymous nature of bitcoin means that is probably not possible for an exchange to be transparent in the way a traditional stock market would be, but there is so much that MtGox could do: how about a TOS? How about some general guidelines? How about some kind of guarantee that the market is not being manipulated?
This is a good question and I don't have an answer right now (though I intend to look at the problem in depth when I get the chance) but my warning above still stands.
@_date: 2011-06-13 23:06:47
I have been watching this for about 20 mins and the feed price and price displayed on the website have gone out of synch as much as +-$3 - the feed went down for me earlier today for a few hours so I wonder is it related to that. Still this is pretty worrying.
Ok, reddit is killing me atm and mangled the last post I made and 502 another two. Apologies for the spamming - I have deleted the dupes.
anyway, what is also alarming is that there has been [huge price movements over this time]( - I wonder are bots using the price feeds ?
@_date: 2011-10-13 17:45:08
I am interested to know if this breaks the rules of the SC2 EULA? I presume the reason you don't see cash (fiat) games of the big competitive computer games is because they generally ban it.

No because it is possible to implement a client that doesn't have to download/store the whole blockchain. Only miners have to have the whole blockchain and we can assume that they will have for the relatively low increase in blockchain size when compared the the growth in Gb/$.

So if a large trade moves the market (like happened at 15:00 UTC yesterday on the chart) would show different circles at each price point where a trade happened? (volume for each transaction rather than the whole trade)
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:49:33
In fact I think the BTC price will rise on MtGox, at least on the short term. Most users will withdraw their balance in BTC or want to - therefore there will probably be a lot more buyers than sellers, so the price will rise. How much depends on how big a stampede there is.
@_date: 2011-06-14 18:36:14
That is all just opinion. 
Sure, it would always have been better to invest earlier, that's what hindsight is for. You could have said that at the start of 2005, when googles stock was $100; because you missed out on buying it when it was $50. Subsequently it went up to $650 (though it didn't stay there for long). You could also have said that in 1981 when gold was worth $850/Toz, only for it to crash to $250 dollars in the space of 6 months. 
I get the impression that you don't know what you are talking about:


Bitcoin wasn't around *years* ago. Gold and silver is still a viable investment on a lot of reasons (inflation hedge, global macro-economic risk, financial freedom etc.). 
When putting forth a view on the future prospects of an investment it helps to include some reasons why. 'because it was cheaper before' is not one of them.

Interested to hear what the lowest price anyone here got was? lowest I got in was 10 :(
@_date: 2011-06-13 18:47:27
No worries, I was finding it hard to explain. 
When you look at a point on your graph where a big order has obviously come in to buy btc up to a price of, say, 20 bucks. If the price were 15 at the time and the order was big enough volume, all the sellers up to 20 would sell to this buyer. That would show an upward spike on the graph, but would it show a different circle for the volume for each transaction as all these sellers sell him their btc, or just one volume circle for his initial buy order?

I disagree. There is a large amount of community activism in bitcoin. It can, and should be used to improve things. Look at the bitcoin video for example: the bounty system *does* work - something that is more of an achievement considering how the system is implemented (on a forum with the worst BB software of all time, no guarantees of the money being paid, the problem of bitcoin changing value etc.)
**Genuine enthusiasm and the willingness to provide your time and effort without immediate gain are the hallmarks of all the most powerful and revolutionary companies and organisations in history.** To ignore this is foolish and companies most certainly don't, trying to foster this kind of community spirit between co-workers (look at Google, Nike etc.), if you read the literature, these companies often attribute a large degree of their success to this one factor. 
So maybe bitcoin isn't a company, but it is a community, and I see no reason not to encourage those who want to improve things for everyone. Perhaps you might even take part yourself.
@_date: 2011-05-29 22:56:58
yeah like others have said on this thread, I would advise you not to discount investing in gold/silver so quickly. There is a very reputable gold dealer in dublin called goldcore - they will sell you physichal gold/silver at pretty reasonable % over spot.

I think this is your biggest problem, at least at the start. I would say a lot of users will be unsure if the system works and will bolt if they see a lot of contracts defaulting. 
I think if you can get past this stage, show that the system works, you will have success. This is far more important than graphics etc. SSL is definitely required, what other options do you have other than password auth?
@_date: 2011-04-28 22:38:27
I would just like to remind people that MtGox is *not even slightly* transparent regarding who is doing the buying and selling. It was suggested on the bitcoin.org forum that the owner of MtGox owns/controls about 1million btc in total. 
Think of the amount of manipulation that could occur if you controlled ~16% of the market **and** the exchange where international prices are set.
I am not saying that MtGox is manipulating the market, just that it would be very easy to do and very profitable. Due to MtGox's lack of transparency we don't/can't know what is going on, and I think it would be wise to be somewhat cynical of these prices.
@_date: 2017-05-03 16:47:42
Good question. It's probably what we'll end up doing. I was just looking into the options. 
It would be useful to have some kind of patreon like system so that we wouldn't have to worry about hosting multiple wallets, converting between wallets, getting payouts etc. I'd be willing to pay a decent commission % for that service.
Since the crowdfunding website we are using won't allow us to display the various addresses, it would be nice to have a central 'official' page which hosted all of this. At the moment I am just thinking of listing the addresses on our website, but maybe there is a better option?

Totally agreed, he should have a pyramid of sell orders so that he can take advantage of the upward market pressure. One huge order  that is bound to overwhelm any buyers, in a situation where shorting is (mostly) impossible just makes no sense to me.
@_date: 2011-05-20 13:06:12
Thanks for the explanation. 
I don't know if you have ever studies the psychology of art, but it is an interesting reason why fine art sells for so much more than music. The reason rich people like art so much is that it is exclusivist. *I own it and you don't*. My Rembrandt is worth orders of magnitude more than your absolutely perfect copy of it. Both are great art but one is worth far more. The medium (oil on canvas, painted in Holland, late 18th centrury) is more important than the message (the art itself, perfectly reproduced by a high quality canvas printer).
On the other hand you have music. A recording of a song is a recording of a song is a recording of a song. There is some market for original vinyl copies of famous records but it is not huge, and the perception people have of a piece of music is that *it is separate from the medium*. 
What you are trying to do is turn the egalitarian world of music into the exclusivist world of fine art. Why would you do such a thing? You want to turn the world of music into the world of art galleries, where a bunch of self-important gatekeepers get to tell everyone else what is valid and what isn't and generally reflect the aims and aspirations of their social group, not yours.

The sea is also full of the stuff, it's just in such small particles that it's hard to extract efficiently. If the price of gold goes up to a point where it becomes profitable to do so, then companies are set up and more gold comes on to the market. More gold in the market helps to suppress the price in a similar manner to inflation in fiat when more money is printed.
On the other side, if gold becomes very cheap (like it did in the 90s) then a lot of these companies (mining companies, generally) go out of business and there is less gold coming on the market which drives the price upward.
This has been going on for centuries and is a well known economic fact. You should do more reading. Gold is a very useful financial instrument and won't be irrelevant any time soon. A wise investment strategy is diversifying. Bitcoin *could* go bang tomorrow just like the world economy you all deride, so don't get your bitcoin fanboying get in the way of being smart.

well if you are buying regularly you should probably be buying btc regularly too. just buy a certain amount in £ every time you get a paycheck, just buy at whatever market is at don't think about it (the difference in effort to buy at the right time is probably not worth the difference in price). that should even out the price a bit and it will make some nice savings for the future.
