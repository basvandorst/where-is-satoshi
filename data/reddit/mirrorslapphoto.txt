I'm still waiting on the first Bitcoin car dealership.

Thank you! I can't wait to test this on a few Bitcoin projects I've been kicking around in my head.

This will probably be my last resort when I can find the right seed password. For now.. I'm still out of luck.

Yes, I already backed up my wallet after importing them. I also have a backup of my wallet from BitcoinQT. Unless I've been hacked.. I still have BTC.. somewhere.

Apparently, that was an old seed address. I may or may not have saved my new seed. I can't seem to find it anywhere even though I know I wrote it down somewhere. :/ 
Yes, most of my addresses were imported keys as I was tired of using BitcoinQT -- it kept crashing and locking up my PC.

Thank you so much for posting these step by step directions! I just added one of my businesses to the map. 
It's great to see the Bitcoin merchant list growing every day.

Couldn't get that to work either. I appreciate the thought.

Oh, media... way to connect those dots. 1 + 2 = cat

Sadly, turning off UAC did not work. 
*thinking outloud* Is there any program that shows what is blocking apps from opening?

Is this a late April Fools joke?
