"Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful" -Warren Buffet
Usually media are the latest to pick up on trends, so it wouldn't be a bad way to invest.

Ok, I stumbled on them as well.
Bearing in mind that the bank transfer can take up to a week, will that be an issue?
What kind of "bank account verification" is needed? I don't have access to the account transfering money in (it's one of my clients), but I have no issue with confirming identity otherwise.
Also bear in mind that my IP is in Copenhagen and client is in UK, so will that be an issue? I have access to HMA, so could switch to UK proxy....but they seem to frown on that.

Localbitcoins is probably more lenient, since it's "normal" people? As long as the name on the bank account matches the person transfered to, then I would assume they were willing to play?

And are the reputable sellers generally able to sell around 1500 EUR worth?

Everything leaves trails, so if someone wants to find out, they will!
But as you say, a black box like off-shore accounts would be best for something like this. But the problem is getting it in to an off-shore account using "normal" means.
I am pretty sure something like Transferwise won't be too happy to move money in to an off-shore account! :)

Well, thanks for spending all that energy on it, anyway.
You have convinced me to just bite the tax bullet until I get clients that are willing to pay in BTC and I can uncouple completely from the "analog world"! (With your "they are watching even BTC" caveat in mind)

Ultimately I want to avoid paying taxes, but still want to have access to my funds via whitewashing, all done in ways accessible to the "average IT joe", since we aren't talking more than around 30k EUR a year, so I wouldn't have access to Private Banking services (which would make this ridiculously easy). 
1) I need to buy BTC to have some BTC trading credibility. If I just sell BTC, with no trade activity that would be more suspicious.
2) SEPA bank transfer from UK to DK or from UK to Austria?
UK to DK it leaves a trail, and if I would get examined by the IRS, then they would also get access to my bank account.
UK to Austria, nothing wrong with that, but client might think it a bit suspicious.

I know. But I don't have a problem IDing and can provide passport copies etc and client is a legit UK company in a legit business, so question is how much they need to ID?
We aren't talking 100K EUR from a shady company in Gibraltar :)

Denmark, actually. Skattevæsenet wouldnøt make much sense to non-danes :) So the Danish IRS.

It seems that transferwise facilitates transfer directly in to bankaccount (UK banktransfer -&gt; transferwise -&gt; DK bankaccount). Do UKforex do the same?
Are there any reputable fx transfers that allow you to "store" your balance online, a la PayPal (but not as draconian)?

I have clients in the UK, that pay me via normal bank transfer. It is too shady to have them pay me in BTC directly, so they insist on using bank transfer (SEPA).
Having money transfered to an off-shore account is also very shady, having it wired to Austria less shady. Using something like Transferwise as go-between would allow the UK firm to transfer to Transferwise -&gt; Austria (or off shore) -&gt; buy local Austrian BTC -&gt; sell local Danish BTC.
In Denmark, profit from BTC are untaxed (they are considered in line with Poker), so I would need to somehow show, that yes, I do trade in BTC. So I would to be able to show that I have bought BTC in DK as well.
So I would need to buy local BTC in DK as well, sell it in Austria and deposit to Austrian bank account. I would hold these BTC as short term as possible to minimize variance.
If asked about the BTC being sold, I could A) refer to the BTC I am also buying ("I trade") and B) refer to the fact, that I have had BTC from the start, "but I have had them in a paper wallet" or something similar, that can't be traced.
At least that is what I have come up with in order to avoid taxes and still use commonly available methods.

If purse.io can give you a 25% discount when paying with BC....what price over spot are they buying BC at?
Especially when looking at the whole set-up: they need to manage BC, manage lists, match wishes and manage Amazon integration/interaction.
