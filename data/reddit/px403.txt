This is the sort of thing that makes me think that we're going to be alright as a species.  The majority of people I know with large Bitcoin holdings are also just awesome people working towards making the world a better place.
In addition to all these amazing donations, I would recommend taking a page from the book of Elon, and start investing in companies directly involved with fixing the world, and founding companies in spaces where none exist.  Companies like Neuralink, and other biotech firms are going to need all the help they can get if they are going to successfully overcome the established medical industry and overhaul what it means to be human.  Most importantly, this technology needs to belong to the people, not the violent and the wealthy.
You're awesome and I wish you the best in all your endeavors :-)  I hope I get the chance to buy you a drink or something some day.

The hard fork should have been done years ago.  Gavin started pushing for it *hard* in 2013.  That would have bought Bitcoin plenty of time to develop better L2 scaling technologies without losing so much of their user base.

People with that much BTC tend to be patient, 10k a day is more than enough, that's still over 3.5 million dollars per year.  There are quicker ways to sell if you're really impatient, and need the money for some medical emergency or something, but most people don't need to be swinging around 5 million dollars here or there on a daily basis.

Sure, emergent consensus and real pruning.  If there's any congestion, miners are incentivized to "make the blocks bigger" (in Bitcoin terms) and collect the higher fees until the congestion dies down.  That means that while congestion does occur during popularity spikes, the matter resolves itself quickly, so it's never a problem for more than a week or so.  Also since the ethereum blockchain gets pruned nicely, there's no extra baggage, which is why Ethereum is processing more than twice as many transactions per day than Bitcoin is without bloating their blockchain.
EVM attacks where people spam the network with CPU intensive contracts have been mitigated by reweighting the instruction costs.  It's been a long long time since any of those were a problem.  Ethereum figured out most of your concerns many years ago, and it's working great.

Do you really think Core is going to ever push for a hard fork?  To my knowledge, the only hard fork they've even discussed in the past two years makes the block size *smaller*.  They're stalling and stalling, because they know that with every day that passes, hard forks become harder to pull off, and their inaction becomes more justifiable.

The users are the miners, and the miners are the users.  I mine, and you could mine if you wanted to.  The debate is about giving us, the people, control over the network, and taking control away from those who have managed to play king of the hill with the github repo.
This is Nakamoto Consensus.  The miners, more than anyone else, are invested in the future of Bitcoin.  They secure the network and give it value.  If someone threatens the value of bitcoin by trying to deprecate its utility as a currency, they should expect resistance.  Core has been shitting all over the community for years now, it's shocking to me that anyone still mines for them.

Seriously WTF.  The mining community is by far one of the largest stakeholders, and this entire drama erupted because they aren't even being given a seat at the table.

It's almost as if that was the exact thing that every major mining company, as well as Adam, Luke, and a bunch of core developers signed on to at the round table consensus meeting last year.

Geez, my post got downvoted in like two seconds.
Bitcoin has a thing called BIPs, or "Bitcoin Improvement Proposals".  Developers write them, people comment on them, and they may or may not get implemented by various implementations.  If there aren't BIPs, there aren't going to be comments.  This is how the community gives feedback to proposals.

I've read the BIP100 series, and Luke's BIP??? that wants to make the blocks smaller.  The latest BIP100 is my favorie among them, but last I heard everyone who worked on the 100 series was removed from Core, so they aren't really considering it.  What are the BIP numbers of the proposals from existing Core developers?

Did you miss all the coordinated attacks where people were scanning and exploiting bugs to crash as many BU servers as they could?
@_date: 2017-03-26 02:58:29
Right now the only people who can change the consensus rules are the core developers.  What BU does is it gives people who mine the ability to signal scaling requests by editing a config file, such that they can coordinate and execute a hard fork without needing to edit any code.
At the moment, BU miners will only accept 1mb blocks, but when the time is right, everyone edits a config file to say they'll accept 2mb blocks, and once enough people claim to accept 2mb blocks, everyone edits their config files again such that they start generating 2mb blocks, and then we have 2mb blocks.

1. The network is on fire.
2. A hard fork is required to fix it.
3. Core won't do a hard fork.
I believe these three things are true.  If these three things are true, the *only* way forward is to support another dev team to fix the network.  I have heard sensible arguments against each of these points, but as every day passes, I see the network become more inflamed, hard forks becoming more difficult, and Core continues entrenching themselves deeper in their "this is fine" mentality.

That's the whole reason why Linus refuses to work for any companies, and why the Linux Foundation was created, so all companies that benefit from the existence of Linux can pay the Foundation out in the open, and the Foundation can fund vendor neutral development.
The existence of the Bitcoin Foundation was 100% to prevent the situation where a company like Blockstream comes in and buys a bunch of developers, and creates a conflict of interest.  I'm pretty frustrated that the Foundation got shit on for trying to be a central authority, and Blockstream, a for profit VC funded company, was able to waltz in and take their place unopposed.
Even if there isn't a conflict of interest, simply creating the illusion of a conflict of interest is damaging to the community.  I'm glad that companies like Blockstream exist that can help fund Bitcoin development, though they really do seem to be getting preferential treatment by the core development team.

My miners are vulnerable, and they're still cranking away.
Also, it's not "fried".  They just stop mining until you turn them off and on again, which I've never seen happen.  Anti-theft telemetry is stupid, but common, and fairly benign in this case.  Getting a DNS hijack on my miners isn't really a likely scenario.
Much more likely is for someone to jack the domain itself, BGP hijack the IP range, or if it's hosted in a shared data center, ARP poison from a neighboring machine.  Each of these attacks can, and have been used much more profitably to just hijack mining traffic.
@_date: 2017-04-28 14:22:46
It's an anti-theft feature, similar to the anti-theft features built into many of the other devices you own.  "Backdoor" implies it would give BITMAIN some control over the device.  It literally just hits a web service, asks if it was stolen, and if it was stolen, it refuses to mine.
Even if BITMAIN wanted to abuse the feature, there are simple workarounds, and it would cause irreparable PR harm, so it would accomplish nothing and ruin the company.  The idea that anyone would do that is ridiculous.  It's just as dumb as saying that any mining pool could shut down a huge part of the network by setting a firewall rule blocking anyone from mining on their pool.  Why would anyone do that?

Against whose claims? Unlike block explorer, blockchain.info has "first seen" for each transaction. This data is acquired by connecting to as many nodes as possible (your client likely lists you on irc), and recording the ip of nodes that pass along transactions. The more nodes they connect to, the more accurate their results are.
Check out a few of the recent transactions you have done. There is a pretty good chance that some of them will have your home ip address, which can easily be traced to your real world identity.

Linking mining to something like seti or folding was discussed early early on, but work units for those networks come from central sources, so it would not be hard for someone to take advantage of that and claim a significant number of coins.  Mining works because the challenges are random and globally agreed upon.  The structure of the challenges also makes it really convenient to adjust difficulty so that a block is solved every ~10 minutes or so, while still being non deterministic.  Seriously, someone might get lucky and solve a block on a TI calculator before a datacenter of ASICs.

The problem with torrents is that data in the torrent is static, it takes up a lot of space, and is only useful if many people are seeding.  Individual torrents can also be attacked in a pretty similar manner as bitcoin's p2p network, so there is a lot of expense, with little gain.  What would be nice is a more robust node management system.  I don't really have a lot of faith in the current IRC bootstrap + hardcoded dns fallback system currently in place.

I have a rule.  Private keys should never leave the macheine they were generated on.  This goes for SSL certs, SSH keys, and sure as hell, bitcoin wallets.
If the funds are to be distributed among a few people, everyone can either use their own wallets, or trust a centralized service that users need to log in to when they want to send coins.
Wallets to generate receiving addresses could be stored on web facing servers, and then have the contents dumped to more trusted wallets at regular intervals (the more secure wallet doesn't even need to be online for this to happen).
In the end, this is just a bit of code moving around, and is a hell of a lot easier than dealing with banks, direct deposit, ACH transactions etc.  Intuit and ADP etc make a fortune because dealing with US dollars is hard, whereas you could probably pay a highschool kid a couple hundred dollars to do something similar with bitcoin.

Okay, so you now control all the ASIC mining, and dominate the bitcoin economy.  This allows you to sell coins and buy more hardware, giving yourself a shit ton of coins.  Bitcoins are worthless if you hold them all, and selling them all without giving anyone else a chance to mine their own coins would severely damage the market.
Starting up a company that actually sells the devices still gives you the chance to mine with your test units, while making bitcoin mining significantly more accessible for everyone else.  More people mining means a larger user base, which means a stronger economy, which is awesome if you are the selling the best mining units.

There's no such thing as crypto with a shelf life of more than 10 years.  If bitcoin intends to last more than 10 years, it's going to need to keep up with NIST recommendations at the very least.  SHA2 (of which SHA256 is a subset) is bleeding bad, and NIST is right about to recommend that everyone move to SHA3 as soon as possible.
I don't expect Gavin to push the change until 2016 or so.  If he doesn't, I predict that coins are going to start mysteriously disappearing around 2020, and then there will be a mass exodus to a stronger blockchain like litecoin, strongcoin,  or something better.
In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if many blockchains pop up with various crypto schemes, and the markets fluctuate based on academic findings that weaken the various schemes in use.

Ya, of course.  Many of the payments were done through google checkout.  I used their highest standard of fraud prevention, which under normal circumstances would have meant that google would have covered any chargebacks.  All payments were from users who had legit gmail addresses, using a card with the same name as the name on their email addresses, how had that card connected to their account for a significant amount of time, and the ip of the payment came from the exact region that matches the card, and the user's google profile.
About half of the attempted purchases were morons trying to clean dirty credit cards, and they never got any bitcoins.  The ones that actually got coins were the ones coming from infected clients directly (I know there was some of this), or even worse, just assholes who did a legit payment, and issued a chargeback, which I have determined is impossible to stop.

With my service, anyone can download the handshake and give it a shot.  I don't do any of the cracking.  More importantly, with my service there is a new way to earn bitcoins.
Interesting site though, I hadn't seen it before.
WRT reaver, ya, that's super useful, but not everyone is on WPS (and likely less in the future).  It's also an online attack, so it can't really be distributed out very well :-)
The site was originally md5/sha1, and has been up for about a year and a half, but never really gained much traction.  Most people looking to crack basic password hashes like that either had huge hash dumps (and didn't feel like entering the hashes one at a time), didn't care about bitcoin, or already had their own infrastructure for doing such things.  At DEFCON this year I got the idea that WPA2 might be more practical for most people.  I will likely bring back support for those hashing algorithms, and also bring in support for things like MS-CHAPv2 and A5/1, which could make things pretty fun.
The service is open source too, so anyone can set up their own if they want.

This is exactly the brilliance of satoshi's contribution.  All crypto currencies before worked the way you describe, but satoshi came up with a relatively fair way to distribute coins evenly among the community.
Before, I could have some coins, and sign them over to a friend of mine.  He could sign some over to a friend of his, and so on.  The thing is though, what incentive do people have to have faith in the value of the currency when it is only being passed out by a central group of people.
If users are able to mine for coins, users who don't even know the developers can get involved, and they have access to create their own.  Bitcoin works best when everybody has a few coins, because only then is there really a concept of relative wealth.

The profits nearly made up for the losses, but the btcnow project was never really about profit, it was about making bitcoins as accessible as possible, and yes it was chargebacks from many many customers.  I would say maybe a third of my customers issued chargebacks.  As part of my anti fraud, I limited the amount of coins a single person could purchase at a time.

Ya, I remember when all that went down.  If it hadn't, I probably would have started accepting Dwolla back in July.  Turns out that google checkout is much MUCH worse at dealing with fraud, and Dwolla has stricter verification procedures in place now so stuff like that doesn't happen as often.
We'll see how it goes :-)  I treat bitcoin like play money, and any dollars I make from it are kept in separate bank accounts that I only use for bitcoin related purchases, so I am not really kept awake at night worry about these issues, though they have hurt me pretty bad in the past.  My goal is to make it as easy as possible to get involved with bitcoins, I have a regular 9-5 job that I pay bills with.

If you want to use instawallet, then use an address from there.  If you are using the local client, then you can generate a new address there, and use that one.  I have not used that particular service, but it sounce like it should just be a bitcoin address under your control.

If implemented correctly, maybe.  I would like to see something more like the DHT that freenet is using, and possibly even web of trust on the nodes.  Of course, direct connections to bitcoind over tcp should always remain an option, I would just like to see more diversity in transport protocols.  Hell, even bitcoin transactions over carrier pigeon would work fine in a world where large parts of the internet got shut down.

It's also against ToS.  Yes, you can stay under the radar longer if you avoid the chargebacks, and prevent people from saying "bitcoin" in the transfer description.  They eventually found and suspended my account, and I was only working with trusted clients.

It's a gamble.  Right now the mining community is pretty well established.  Some sell their coins instantly, some try to get a good price for them, and some are mining just to hold on to them long term.
When the ASICs start shipping, and the reward gets cut in half, GPU mining will be a thing of the past, and there will be a whole new generation of people mining.  If the number of sellers/holders changes, the price will be directly affected.  I plan on holding my coins, so if most people are like me, the price will go up.  There is also the chance that people who jumped on the ASIC preorders are only in it for the dollars, which means insta-sell, and a pretty hard price drop.

People ask me so often why it's so hard to buy bitcoins with credit cards, and this sort of thing is an awesome example.  These companies give out play money that doesn't actually exist to people who can't afford the interest, and then the cc companies turn around and screw over the merchants every chance they get.  The system was not designed to be secure, and there is no way to glue on security after the fact.  Eventually the overhead of all this fraud is going to crush them, and rightfully so.

I've found that the top selling point that potential merchants haven't considered is that there are a ton of people with bitcoin just waiting for something to spend it on.  If you can open up a corner of the market that is less explored, then there is huge potential for increased sales.
To OP: More importantly, if you allow your artists to earn bitcoins through your label, then I would also predict an explosive growth in that area, since there are a significant number of amateur musicians who are into bitcoin, and would love to have a new way to earn them rather than buying them from the various pain in the ass markets.
Imagine all the 14 year old musicians in Sudan, and Mongolia who would now be able to earn something real that they could spend online without having to worry about the layers and layers of fees normally accumulated during international payments (especially for people who can't get bank accounts yet).

This article gave me a random thought.  It occurs to me that bitcoin is used wherever it's more convenient than using US dollars (or gold, or chickens, etc).  As long as the dollar stays safe, convenient, and easy to use, it will always dominate the bitcoin economy.
This can actually apply a significant amount of pressure to keep the dollar relativity unregulated and safe to use.  Each time new banking regulations are added, each time cash payments are discouraged, each time ATM or credit card fraud hits the news, bitcoin will gain support.
In this way, the mere existence of bitcoin keeps the US dollar safer for everyone.

What I would really like to see is a bitcoin client that lets you manage various methods for connecting to the p2p network.  The crypto junkies have created a really nice and solid way to verify transactions, but they really need to bring in some p2p people to make the p2p network robust.  The IRC channel thing was good for a proof of concept, but it's a shameful joke compared to the transport methods that are available today.
The default client doesn't even let you view which bitcoind servers you are connected to, let alone let you chose, or see any meaningful trust relationships about those bitcoind servers.

Brute forcing the key is, by definition, the dumbest way to break it.  There are always collisions and reductions, and more get discovered all the time.

PKI is more than just transferring ephemeral keys though, it's about authority hierarchy, and chains of trust etc.  Also, even if the short distance thing was solved, it is extremely unlikely that you will be able to do this over anything but a dedicated point to point fiber connection, which absolutely does not scale for consumer use.

The point of FPGA/ASIC is that they use significantly less power.  If you are running a mining operating out of your house, you will eventually get to a point where you are blowing circuits.  With these you can stack 10x-100x more hashrate with the same grid.
As they get more and more mass produced, the price will also keep dropping.

There seems to be a significant amount of effort around avoiding signing up for a dwolla account.  Seriously though, sign up for dwolla, verify yourself, and send it money from your bank.  It takes a couple days for the money to transfer, but then you will be set, and easily be able to get US dollars in and out of mtgox.  Also, my site at btcnow.net will send you bitcoins within seconds of purchase if you buy with dwolla.

Yes, there are criminal hackers that use LR, but it is extremely common for any other facet of cybercrime as well, and actual hacking is really only a small fraction of what goes on in cybercrime (credit card theft, money laundering, extortion, piracy, etc).
Also, a vast majority of hackers, even the darkest blackhats, tend to pay their bills with money earned through totally legit work, and have no need for LR.

Hey, I know we are on the same team here, so don't take this as any sort of argument, but you should know that there is no chance of chargebacks or fraud with bitpay (unless the bitpay people themselves go crazy).
The risk comes when converting dollars to bitcoins.  When converting bitcoins to dollars, it's significantly safer, since the crypto protects the coins (which has always been the point of bitcoin).  This means that bitpay is able to send real dollars directly to your bank account within seconds of when the bitcoin transaction is sent.
This also means that there isn't even a real risk of bitpay getting hacked, since they never need to store significant amounts of bitcoins.  In the worst case scenario, some transactions might get intercepted in the short gap of time between when the site is penetrated and when the penetration is detected.
Either way, I think third party gateways for sites like kiva are much more realistic in the short term.  The next few months of bitcoin is going to be a bit stormy though while people adjust to the payout split and the new world of asic miners, but as the economy stabilizes I'm confident that the reputation of bitcoin will improve.

The price has been pretty stable recently, so it might be as good of a time as any.  Don't get too caught up on prices though, and I would definitely advise against buying bitcoins with money that you need to survive on.
I have seen too many people making the mistake of converting their life savings to bitcoins, planning to sell off a bit at a time to live off of as the price goes up.  The price always seems to drop from under those people, and they usually end up panic selling.
If it's an amount of money that you would panic over losing, it's not worth putting into bitcoin, or the stock market, or really anything with a high amount of associated risk.

In my opinion you want to buy food locally, so why not use your local currency to buy it?  The areas where bitcoin dominates is for things like games, art, code, etc.  Places where people can contribute and consume online, and don't want to deal with the burden of exchanging via whatever local currencies they use for day to day transactions.
Of course there should always be exchanges between bitcoin and local currencies, and maybe it will be more convenient for in person transactions someday, but I think focusing on online applications will be the most fruitful in the short term.

Check out the associated IPs.  These coins are rolling all over the place like crazy, many of which being moved by IPs that have never before been seen on the network.  Could be tor exit nodes, VPNs, or just owned hosts.  Poking at it for a few minutes, I don't see any obvious IPs that stand out as suspect, but someone else might have some better luck.

Right, it looks like there are three fallback nodes at the moment, since the bluematt.me node is down.  The xf2 node and sipa.be node didn't come up yesterday because I was looking for dnsseed.* in the code.
I'm not sure if I agree with your use of the word "route" (seems to imply that part of the path has been blocked, not the final destination) but yes, of course once people are aware of the problem they can do some manual workarounds.  I never said this attack would be completely devastating, infact I think I said the exact opposite.  The point is that enough users would be knocked offline for a while that it would start to affect the economy.
My main gripe about their P2P is that you can't view and manually add/remove nodes that you are connected to from the client.  It would be much easier for users if, once the attack starts, you could eliminate misbehaving nodes, and drop in a few .onion nodes or something.  Even if it could be done from the command line in real time without having to shut down the server, edit the file, and start the daemon back up.  Yes, things have improved significantly since the IRC peer exchange, but there is still significant room for improvement.

First off,  the 51% attack was described in detail before the first line of code was written.  Second, it doesn't give you the entire bitcoin network, it just let's you forge transactions for a few minutes, letting you fake out people who don't wait for their incoming transactions to verify properly.  Third, even if someone wanted to do this, it would always cost significantly more than could possibly be gained.  Finally, even if someone was dumb enough to do this, people would just move to using other block chains that aren't getting shit on by some asshole.

You don't route around DDoS :-)  You either move, or filter, and attempt to do so quicker than the attacker is able to adapt.  The reason I am saying what I am saying is that the current setup of the bitcoin network is relatively entrenched in its central servers.  Yes, they would be able to provide moments of temporary relief, but to actually solve the larger problem would take a month or two of non trivial development time.  The main developers, however, seem uninterested in solving these problems (and numerous solutions have been proposed in the past two years) until a credible threat emerges.

I used to buy coins from him in blocks of 100 and 500, and I was one of his smaller customers.  He has an extremely good reputation for being able to move a ton of coins very quickly.  I never invested in his savings and trust though.  From my observations, his business would be greatly helped by the higher liquidity granted by large numbers of investors, and at the premiums he charges for large volumes of bitcoins transferred quickly, he could easily pay back 7%, at least for short periods of time.
The 7% was his highest rates too, and he dropped them when he had more investors than he needed.  When more investors dropped out than expected, he likely got frustrated and decided to go back to handling the liquidity himself.
That said, it will be very interesting to see of he can pull off a clean dismount without going broke himself, but I do think that it's very possible.  Will be fun to watch :-)

Funny trading story that I heard once.  So, in India, the wedding season happens every spring, and since gold is an extremely important to Hindu culture, demand tends to go way up during that time period.  The question then is, why doesn't the price spike every spring?
The answer is that experienced gold traders **know** that demand is going to go up in the spring, and they trade accordingly.  By buying early, the demand gets artificially inflated during periods where practical demand is low.  Thus the total demand is almost always constant, and the price remains relatively steady around predictable demand spikes.
The only time that there is real price fluctuation is when something unexpected happens.  If, for example, gold demand in the spring is lower than expected, the price will drop, even if demand is much higher than other times in the year.

Doubt it.  Large volume trading is a huge pain when the price starts going wild as it has been in the past couple weeks.  There was no way he could keep his returns steady, so people decided to withdraw.  Once enough people withdrew, he couldn't keep up with the high volume orders he was getting, so he started losing customers.
Think about it, you sell a couple thousand bitcoins to someone, and before you can buy up new coins, the price goes up 10%, and you are left with less coins than you started with.  Then someone wants to buy more coins, and before you can restock, the price goes up 10% again.  In that sort of economy, there is no way someone can offer competitive prices **and** provide the insane payouts to investors the way he was doing.

I thought everyone figured out in the 70s that being "backed" by something like precious metals was massively damaging.  Yes, it's nice to say things like the dollar is backed by gold, but is it really realistic to think that the price of the US dollar is going to be able to keep up with the price of gold?  How do you think we would be able to compete globally if 50 dollars was still worth the same as an ounce of gold?  In my opinion, pegging the dollar to gold was extremely arrogant in the first place, and we are better off with floating currencies.

The way you get your 50 bitcoins is by taking a given chunk of data that everyone has, and appending some data to it such that it has a certain number of leading zeroes.

Ideally, it would present a new donation address to each user who accesses the page, or at least generate a new address every couple minutes if the load gets too high.  The problem is that you have now associated that address with your personal identity.
This will show potential IP addresses of everyone that has donated to you, and will also let people see where you are sending those particular coins from, and potentially get your IP address, and then look at all coins sent from your home IP.
I'm sure all this is fine for your purposes, but anyone taking donations for something considered controversial should look into using a bitcoin php library or something to dynamically generate new addresses for each transaction.

I don't quite buy that people are using "bidwall" strategies to manipulate the market.  Is there any other market where this phenomenon occurs?  In my opinion as a computer scientist (thus totally qualified to comment on economic phenomena) bid walls are simply an indication that actual humans still dominate the market.  This is why you always see bidwalls form around nice round numbers.
A well programmed bot wouldn't care about round numbers.  In fact, when placing an order, it is *always* better to place orders away from bid walls, since as a merchant, you are always looking to slightly undercut or slightly outbid your competition.
To me that looks like some guy placing 25k usd buy orders every 5 cents up to 100 dollars.  That is an extremely human thing to do.

*"At its roots, Bitcoin is based on some rather clever mathematics, ironically the same primitives that keep our credit cards secure when buying things online."*
Hahah, absofuckingloutly not.  Handing over a string of numbers to every vendor and saying "Here's my ID number, trust that I have money" is completely different than using PKI.
My absolute favorite thing about bitcoin is that when you buy with credit cards, you are literally handing out the exact information needed to steal your identity.  When you are buying with bitcoins, you are just signing over coins, which gives almost the absolute minimum about of personal information to the vendor as possible.
Right now, if I want to steal your identity, I just need to compromise any store or website that you have ever purchased anything from, but with crypto currencies, the only way to steal someones identities is to steal them from the person themselves.

Ever think of the merchants?  Any service that takes credit cards can be trivially ripped off by malicious customers, and there are a hell of a lot more malicious customers than malicious merchants.  If you can't show visa tracking and shipping confirmation, you lose any chargeback dispute, so nothing digital (apps, media, content subscriptions, donations) can safely be sold online with credit cards.
There is absolutely no recourse against scammers when they pay with a credit card, and I have lost thousands of dollars in revenue because of it.  In an online scam, you can stay safe by only purchasing from trusted merchants, but how is a merchant supposed to sell only to trusted customers?  You need either complex and difficult to use webs of trust, or highly invasive identification and verification processes, since digital ID theft is trivial these days.

TLS is completely unrelated to credit card security.  You would be shocked at how easy it is to dump credit card databases of 90% of online shops out there.

The whole notion if a "reversible transaction" is pretty ridiculous.  Maybe it makes since with credit cards because they are trivial to skim, and every time you buy something from someone, you give them enough information to steal your identity, but that's really a limitation of the technology that they chose to trust.
Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed.  Bitcoins also cannot be forged, duplicated, or sent without the explicit authorization of whoever holds the private key.  Both the customers and the merchants (especially the merchants) have significantly fewer exposures.
You are entitled to your opinion, but I think that in the rapidly growing information economy, bitcoin is often times a more sustainable option than credit cards, just look at how huge the infrastructure is to support the credit card system, and how rampant credit card fraud still is.

Sellers are afraid to sell because now the price is going up so fast.  Less sellers means coins are harder to buy, causing the price to go up.  There is also likely quite a bit of panic buying from people who wanted to get in while the price was low, and are afraid that they are missing their chance, so they are more willing to buy at historically high prices.
I for one hope that the coming crash happens soon so the price will stabilize and we can get back to being a productive and stable economy.

Sorry, dwolla got hit hard with some massive fraud a few months back. and they don't play well with the bitcoin community anymore.  Wire transfers or ACH deposits straight to mtgox or bitfloor should work.  Remember to withdraw coins right when you purchase them, they are much safer on your local machine (assuming you know how to keep your system reletivly clear of malware).
@_date: 2012-08-24 16:20:49
5 years is a pretty large range IMO, especially since rule number one of NIST crypto standards is that no crypto algorithm will ever withstand scrutiny for more than 10 years before being rendered unsafe.
@_date: 2012-06-21 09:16:35
Do you know why yet?  When I got my Dwolla suspended, it was because someone sent me money who turned out to have committed ACH fraud.  Your account also could have been compromised.  If you didn't attempt to steal from them, then you're probably fine, and have nothing to worry about.  They seem to have just gotten a bit jumpy from all the ACH fraud they have been dealing with lately.

Yeah, if someone gets root on your phone they can take your coins.  I guarantee that the same is true for the SafeWallet app that they're trying to promote too.
Unless you're doing some hardware backed key management, your private keys are going to eventually going to be decrypted in memory in your phone, and even with hardware backed, root can modify the UI on your next transaction to make look like the transaction you want, but actually empty your wallet.

In theory, if it's an obvious scam, google should be able to notify visa, and visa should absorb the loss.

See, I don't think the potential really lies in getting existing companies to start accepting bitcoins alongside US dollars.  There is a strong real potential for entirely new products and services to be created that were not possible, or not as feasible when bought and sold in US dollars.
Even business models that have failed horribly in the past, like paying for bittorrent downloads, or paying for wiki entries and news articles, might actually succeed if the incentives are structured properly.  A lot of crowd-sourced data aggregation services failed because payouts for producers were too small to be useful, and consumers were unwilling to pay even small amounts for content just out of convenience.
Imagine if you could buy/sell reddit karma for bitcoins, and also use karma to buy special powerups :-)  It would be a totally different site, but I think it would work, and I think it would be interesting.

@_date: 2011-09-27 19:28:58
And there are significantly more coins in actual circulation.  When old money cashes out, it drops the price and makes bitcoin more accessible.
Also, when the price says "30 dollars" on mtgox, that just means that one person was willing to pay 30 dollars for one bitcoin.  Then the people willing to buy at 30 got what they wanted, and no one has been willing to buy at 30 since.  It doesn't mean that every coin is worth 30 dollars.

Most of the "early adopters" weren't hoarding bitcoins, they were using them to encourage growth in the economy.  I think the coin distribution as it is today is a lot more even than some people think.  Yes there are people who have disproportional amounts, but I would bet that there are just as many wealthy bitcoiners who started in may 2011 as there are who started in may 2010.

There can be more than one blockchain currency, but but it's pointless to have another currency with the same distribution system (mining).  If you were to change up the distribution system, like by tracking BOINC points, or pinning it to the US dollar etc, you could make a new and entirely valid crypto currency.  Then it's just a matter of getting people to use it.

It's very interesting.  I just added in the anti fraud detection as suggested in the developer guide, and it looks like it triggered.  As near as I can tell, they had their card linked to a fake address in Israel.
I'm actually pretty impressed that my code didn't automatically send them coins, google does not really give any details on why they think a transaction might be fraudulent, but this makes me feel a hell of a lot safer selling bitcoins like this.

Bitcoins aren't some horse at a racetrack for you to bet on.  Don't buy bitcoins unless you intend to use them.  If you are a merchant that wants a truly secure global currency, free of chargebacks and artificial manipulation, then start selling things for bitcoins, and start setting up bitcoin based services.
Yes, it is a successful currency, but buying them now just so you can sell them back for USD later is a dick move.  Hoarding currencies is damaging to any economy.

Online mining service?  Where do you do that at?
The sending address won't get you much, you need the actual wallet.dat file, but I would suggest just running the main bitcoin client on your primary computer, and transferring the coins from the online service to your own receiving addresses when you can.

This is a very untested legal area, but I am curious how sure you are of your methods.  To me it seems like nothing more than adding a popup box that asks "do you really super double dog promise to pay?".  I wonder where the line is.
Technically, they do have to create an account, their google account.  Does the US legal system really care so much about a scribbled name on a piece of paper?  
Ideally I would hook everything into a magical web of trust, and only sell to people of certain status in the trust network.  Maybe I could require that they connect their purchase to a bitcoin-otc account, but that would be a huge hassle for customers, and sort of eliminate the "now" from btcnow :-)

@_date: 2011-08-14 19:38:10
IMO the best thing about bitcoin is how difficult it is to counterfeit, which is where a significant portion of the anti fraud effort resides.  Wallets are also totally different than credit cards numbers.  Credit card numbers are easy to steal because they are used in every credit card transaction.  Bitcoin wallets use private keys that are never supposed to leave your system, so they are much easier to protect.

The global hashrate is just under 8th/s, which means that people who start mining again now will be getting 50% more coins than they were getting back when the global hashrate was 12th/s.
@_date: 2011-09-18 18:54:22
Having bitcoins isn't the problem, but hoarding massive amounts for the sole purpose of selling them later is.  For an economy to work, it needs to be easy to make money, and easy to spend money.  The goal is to increase the amount of movement relative to the entire value of the economy.  When people hoard, it takes it out of circulation, which artificially inflates the price, which I believe has a destabilizing effect.
@_date: 2011-08-16 17:04:55
Ha, either way works.  After the hack, mtgox took about 50 of my coins and held them for almost two months before I finally got them back, so I don't really have a lot of faith that they actually are holding 100% of the coins.  Online wallets work, but it's always nice to have your private keys on your local system.

@_date: 2011-09-06 02:39:18
Imagine that there are a significant number of people saying to themselves "when the BTC price hits 10 dollars, I'm selling".
The "wall" references the high number of people all looking to sell at the same price, and when people actually start buying the price, the wall starts getting shorter until all the 10 dollar coins get sold.  This usually doesn't happen, and often the price moves back down, which is like a retaining wall holding back a tide.  If you want your coins to get purchased first, you need to make sure that you stay back a bit from the wall, like selling at 9.97 or something.
Check out the market depth at 
You see a ton of people looking to trade at 9, 10 and 10.5 etc.  These are naturally round numbers that humans tend to focus on but they really have no significance on a continuous system like bitcoin prices.  Since trades happen automatically, it is to your advantage to undercut sales, same as in any market.
If you are at a market selling hats at 9.99 and everyone else is selling at 10, everyone is going to buy all of your hats first, while still getting a pretty good price for what you are selling.  Of course, if someone comes along and starts selling at 9.97 9.95 etc then they get to undercut you.  That happens a bit in bitcoin, but so many actual humans are executing the buys and sells, you see prices at nice round numbers that are easy to undercut.
@_date: 2011-08-22 23:49:40
Each coin splits down to 10^-8.  You aren't going to have 0.00004364 coins, you're going to have 43.64 micro coins (mc, mBTC, whatever), and at that point there is going to be more than enough to go around.

Right now I have more buyers than I can really keep up with, but as that levels out, I will probablly start selling at goxhigh*1.2 then 1.15, then maybe 1.1 or 1.05 if I can get the volume high enough to make it worth it.

Nothing **is** anonymous though, it's a relative term.  Just remember who can track what and how they track it and make decisions wisely.  You don't need a photo id, so it's more anonymous than western union for online transactions.  You can say cash in person is more anonymous because there are no records of the transaction, except that it's in person, which has it's own risks.

Just went online today.  It's still a bit flaky in places, but it works.
code is here   
Just looking to get some real usage data on the site right now.  Only hex encoded md5 and sha1 are available at the moment, but we are looking to add more soon.  If you want to add anything like new hash verifiers, rss feeds, xmpp alerts, cleaner APIs or anything fancy like that, let me know.  I will pay out for cool features like that, or any others you can think of.
edit : how it works
1. submit your hash, server responds with email containing activation address
2. send an initial bounty to the activation address so it shows up on the site
3. someone cracks the hash, and submits the solution
4. the server verifies the solution, emails you the solution, sends bitcoins to solver

xilinx fpgas are more expensive, but are quite a bit faster than the cyclone FPGA in the original SDK that code was released for.  There is also a ton of commodity hardware around to fit 10 xilinx FPGAs into a single PCIe card.  With two of those, and some private FPGA code, it looks like someone on the forums was running desktops at 10gh/s at significantly less power than any of the GPU mining rigs.  
Now that xilinx code is public, anyone with that hardware laying around (I know a few people) can easily start cranking out bitcoins like mad.

The original order was sent on August 16th.  I got the payout ~10 days later.  The chargeback happened a couple days ago.  Even if I lose, I'm not sure how google intends to issue the chargeback since they suspended that checkout account.  It will be interesting to see how it all plays out.

Not complaining, just curious if there was some hole in my logic that I missed.  My comment seemed pretty straightforward to me.
@_date: 2011-08-19 20:09:45
No, not rewritten, the crypto in the bitcoin client is abstracted, and from my talking with the devs about it, it seems they intend to bump the algorithms to meet NIST recommendations from time to time.  Everyone needs to agree to use the new crypto at a given block, and then everything should continue like normal.  There are many emerging technologies that threaten to break keys quicker than we can imagine, so don't focus too hard on quantum.
Also quantum cryptography is not what it sounds like.  It typically refers to a few methods of implementing a one time pad like solution by taking advantage of properties of quantum mechanics.  It has nothing to do with public key cryptography.

On my old amd 2200 I mined 900 coins in 2 days, then I stopped for a while because it was making my desktop a bit laggy.  I started mining again back in june at around 500mh/s and have maybe gotten 50-60 or so coins since then.

Special request :
I know you are likely working on a ton of features right now, but could you make this embeddable in a website?  Good for you because, presumably, you are running the pool and get to take your cut, and good for me because it could replace advertisements, and as more webcl capable browsers come online it makes a lot more sense than bombarding your readers with ads.
@_date: 2011-05-25 07:52:53
When I first started, I thought I was getting into it late because I was only generating 450BTC per day (on an amd2200).  At the time I calculated that it wasn't even worth the cost of electricity, so I quit, and I'm just getting back into it now.
Buy a 5870 or 5970 and point it at your local bitcoin pool, and you will see a bit of income.  Even that small trickle can end up being worth a lot some day.  More importantly though, remember to buy what you can with bitcoin, and get involved with selling services of your own via bitcoin.  You will probably want to buy some bitcoins with USD to get started though.
@_date: 2011-08-16 04:52:31
Ah, mtgox probably waits for confirmations.
I'm seeing 1 confirmation so far to the XXXyoG and none yet to the XXX6if address.  When I was testing sending to the official bitcoin client, I was able to see the transaction hit the network almost immediately.

No, I used wire transfers.  The best way to get coins anonymously (a relative term) is selling digital content.  You can't spend US dollars on anything and expect to remain anonymous. 
@_date: 2011-06-17 06:09:00
bitcoinpool.com is nice.  They only take a cut of the payouts if you want them to, so their payouts are generally higher than other pools.  They have some downtime issues (rapidly expanding to handle load) but you can always just mine on two pools at the same time, and if one goes down you can still submit proof of works to the other :-)

You should have seen the original concept, without mining.  The reason previous crypto currencies have failed is because someone always had to start with all the coins, and distribute to friends etc.  Satoshi's primary contribution (in my opinion) that lead to the success of bitcoin was the concept of mining, so anyone anywhere can download the client, start generating coins, and get involved with the community.
Yes, there are a few old money bitcoiners out there, but almost every one of the "early adopters" started cashing out when bitcoins were worth a penny, then 10 cents, then a dollar.  You've seen the posts on the bitcoin forums where people are buying pizzas for thousands of bitcoins right?  Even the lead developers of the project aren't rich.  Gavin has said he has a few thousand laying around, but even some merchants who came in in April have more than that.
There was obviously quite a bit of old money selloff around June, but every day it's getting more balanced.
@_date: 2011-09-07 08:53:11
I've sold maybe around 200 coins so far, and while most of them were in the 1-10 range, there have been a few in the 20-40 range, but not generally anything larger than that.

Thanks for the concerned emails, and for those that didn't notice, my checkout account for btcnow.net was suspended.  Google claimed that I was taking orders from sites other than btcnow.net, which doesn't even make any sense, except that I did a couple test orders during the development phase to check my instant callback before I set the domain up, which I guess is a big no-no.
Anywho, the launch of accesscoin.com lit the fire under my ass and I got the site back online tonight, and just because I'm a dick I set my price to 8.5 USD per coin (accesscoin.com is selling for 8.6) :-D  If you recall I also pay out instantly, which no other site I know of does.  btcnow offers 24/7 instant bitcoins over google checkout.

@_date: 2011-08-12 23:16:06
ECC is correct.  Also, talking with the devs it seems that they intend to cycle to harder crypto every 10 years or so to keep up with NIST recommendations.  In 20-30 years it will likely be feasible to crack large abandoned wallets that haven't made the migration.
@_date: 2011-09-10 23:16:51
Who said illegal contracts?  And where have you ever seen crime for hire with bitcoins?  In the software world, contractors are people who write random apps tools games etc in various languages.  They tend to live all over the world, and have a hard time receiving payment in USD, making bitcoin an ideal method of payment.  I have hired contractors with BTC, and have sold code for BTC.  No one is excellent at all languages and platforms.

protip : don't try to make money with it right out of the gate.  Start off with a few under priced plans and increase rates as demand grows.  If you already have the hardware then it's almost no cost to you and you get a steady income of coins.  Getting a good happy customer base is more important than profit early on.  Most restaurants operate at a loss for their first 2-4 years after opening.
@_date: 2011-07-29 16:17:43
What it probably means (scary enough) is that they haven't detected any malicious behavior.  Maybe they just have a high enough profit margin that they can cover fraudulent transactions.  Either way a whole legion of scammers just had their ears perk up at hearing the news :-)
@_date: 2011-08-17 12:40:24
So far google has stopped 8 or so purchases for looking malicious, and I have stopped one in response to failing google's chargeback guarantee check.  I guess we'll see at the end of the month if any went through.  So far, everyone who has purchased any coins from me has used their real email linked to their home address, and they seem like upstanding citizens for the most part :-)
It looks like my biggest exposure is someone getting into the account of someone with a good google checkout history, and burning it by buying bitcoins, and even then there is a pretty good chance that google or visa will absorb the loss.
It's bullshit like chargebacks that just reaffirms to me the need for something like bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-08-08 02:50:19
If you encrypted the password for your Swiss bank account with 30-40 year old crypto, and posted the ciphertext publicly, would you expect that to be secure?
Storing coins on a USB stick like that is very secure, just remember to bump the crypto from time to time.   If you are really paranoid about it, spread the coins over a few wallets to reduce risk.  You can't do that with gold :-)
@_date: 2011-11-07 03:43:45
As a protip, many bitcoin-otc sellers will sell you all the coins they have though MoneyPak, since it seems to completely eliminate the risk of chargebacks.  You can buy them in conveniance stores all over, but I have had the best luck finding them in stock at Rite-Aid.

Ya, replacing the dollar is funny.  It's about as silly as having the potato chip replacing the dollar.  In my perspective, bitcoin is just another form of bartering that is more conducive in certain environments.  Environments where bartering has been notoriously difficult until now.

Secondly : As fun as custom URL schemes are, they are super dangerous and I would never want to connect one to my bitcoin client.

I was half thinking about an interesting scenario for physical delivery networks earlier tonight.
A customer wants something delivered, so they push out a promise that they will pay 50btc to the sender.  The messenger can promise to deliver it in 5 hours or less.  The package gets delivered, the customer "signs the package" and the sender (whoever they are) gets paid.
Now add in a whole chain of messengers, each allowed to cut 5-10% in such a way that the moment the package is signed, everyone gets paid.  In theory, I don't even think that the original messenger would need to know the final price that the customer paid.
Now add in the concept of insurance and liability such that every messenger needs to put down collateral to transport the package and if delivery fails, the cost will fall on whoever is holding the package.  The one who failed is fucked, and everyone else gets paid out in full, and they don't even need to know the final status of delivery.
I have not looked too deep into contracts and scripts, but do you think something like this could be possible?  I was originally thinking of payments with bitcoins, but contracts dealt with via a totally new distributed storage network, but it very well may be possible with just bitcoins alone.
@_date: 2011-09-13 15:41:11

Ya.. about that.  I made it whitelist only a few weeks ago, and google didn't seem to care and has still been hunting down and banning my merchant accounts.  The site might might be down for a bit, and when it comes up, it will likely still be whitelist only, and I might be doing processing with paypal or something, but hopefully I will be able to sell to the general public via moneypak, wiretransfer, etc.
accesscoin is good when online, I have purchased quite a bit of coins from get-bitcoin.com, and as always the nice people on  but they are less helpful to people with no reputation.
Fuck everything about credit cards, bitcoins are going to make things so much easier.
Thanks for the plug though, I appreciate it :-)
@_date: 2011-08-27 21:04:10
Except it doesn't end up happening that way.  The balancing force of the market is always stronger than any momentum one person could throw around.  The moment you start selling for no reason, people are going to start buying in response.  If you had a significant hold on the market, the price probably will end up lower, but the moment you start buying back, the price will start going back up.  In the end, the price will probably be just about where it was before, but you will be down maybe 10%.
Remember that real high volume trades aren't going to be filled at all once.  If a company's stock price is 10 dollars, you can't just buy half of the company for 10 dollars per share.

Hey, btcnow.net should start accepting credit cards in the next week to two.
How are you protecting against chargebacks?  I am looking at very liberal usage of the fraud APIs through my ACH provider, and a whitelist based system that is quite a bit more lax compared to what I have been doing for customers buying through paypal and google checkout.

It is still a bit flaky, but usable.  Obviously don't put in any serious amount of coin, but if you have some spare change why the hell not right?  You will notice a striking similarity in site design to btcnow.net, which I also run.

Hey, I run btcnow, been selling bitcoins over google checkout for a while now, and you have no idea how crazy things are.  Do you understand the concept of chargebacks?  If you were to buy some bitcoins, then call your credit card company and say you didn't authorize the purchase, you would have your coins and your money back.  Selling coins from credit cards, paypal, google checkout, etc is EXTREMELY risky to the seller, so it will be hard to purchase coins without undergoing a personal background check, or becoming involved in a web of trust, such as the bitcoin-otc model.
This is one of the primary reasons bitcoin was invented, to make online payments simple and safe for both parties.  Credit cards make things super easy for consumers by pushing all liability onto merchants.
@_date: 2011-08-08 02:58:24
I disagree, eventually the signing crypto will get bumped.  After that, all transactions will end up in more secure wallets, so active wallets will be more protected.

I can do lamp, but I am neither a fan of apache, mysql, or php.  Recently I have been using hosted services like google's appengine, and that seems to work really well.  Of course the important stuff is still off on my magical linux vps somewhere, but I feel a lot safer using google's hosting and data APIs so I don't need to be quite as paranoid about things like ddos and sql injections.
I've still got a few ideas for services I would like to set up, but if you have more that would be fun.  I have been doing my recent appengine stuff in python, and I have a full time day job, so I really work on these projects on the hour long train ride to and from work, and a couple nights out of the week that I have set aside for personal projects.
I've got some crazy ideas for things like an ebay clone, a content delivery network, and even a savings and loan.  The reason that I did btcnow first was so I could generate some solid BTC income that I could use to pay contractors to help with the other projects :-)

Ah, I was wondering how beneficial a tutorial would be.  For some reason I just assume that everyone reading from would know what bitcoin is :-)
If you go to bitcoin.org, you can download a program that will manage your bitcoin wallet.  In the top of the program, you will see a bitcoin address.  If you buy the coins from me, my website will take your checkout payment, and send the bitcoins to your address.  They should appear almost immediately, and can be used to purchase a growing number of goods and services all over the internet.
All transfers are cryptographically verified and distributed globally, so it is near impossible to counterfeit any money in the system.

My credit union lets me do cash advances with no fees or penalties.
@_date: 2011-10-20 18:14:47
Yes of course, this idea has been around for a while, but the hard part is implementation :-)
For free, we have services like BOINC, but ideally it would be awesome if people could get paid to contribute to those massively distributed problems.  Bitcoin is a perfect avenue to pay people for that, especially since miners could switch the rigs they already have between networks as one or the other is more profitable.
The next problem is to find people with large data sets that they are looking to calculate, and are willing to pay for.  This sounds like something everyone would jump on, but in reality it seems like everyone who needs their datasets crunched already has a pretty decent setup to do it, thanks to university funding, or the dataset is something they want to keep secret until they can publish a paper or whatever.
My attempt at starting something like this was hashbounty.net.  It was going to start with cracking hashes, then become more cloudy and support more problem classes.  I had plenty of people with rigs willing to solve problems, but there just didn't seem to be a market full of people that 1. had bitcoins 2. had this type of problem that they needed solved.
It's a good idea, but without significant startup costs and risks, I haven't been able to come up with a good way to make it real.
@_date: 2011-08-08 02:34:30
Exactly, that's why forward secrecy is getting more popular, like OTR and DH in tls for web  :-)    Bitcoin deals with this really well in my opinion.  New wallets generated after the bump will be more secure, and it will be trivial to migrate your coins when it does happen. 
@_date: 2011-10-02 21:28:58
You can sell them to me.  If you send 50 coins to 17CDUizrsxAqsV4ARnYQUoU6qZ6spPytB3  I'll pay 5.20 each for them.  Thats 260 US sent via paypal to whichever address you chose.  I sell coins on  and like to believe that I have somewhat of a good reputation to uphold, so you can be assured that I'm not going to be playing any fancy tricks with the paypal.
@_date: 2011-12-18 19:19:51

Holy crap, that's the entire point, it's not an investment and people need stop thinking in terms of gaining/losing value vs the USD.
Bitcoin has a great potential for enabling **new** markets.  Any sites, services, or games with karma, or points could let you buy in or cash out with bitcoins.  Imagine being able to transfer all of your slashdot karma to reddit, or turn unused WoW gold into mafia wars items.
Bitcoin has massive potential that I think people aren't seeing because they think of it only in terms of selling it for US dollars.
@_date: 2011-09-28 13:42:08
If anything the mtgox information makes it more likely that it was him, since it proves that he was into bitcoins months before he made the transactions with me.  Gmail did forced password resets on all connected accounts, and the physical address on his credit card matched the geoip for recent logins etc.
@_date: 2011-12-22 15:49:33
Have at it.  Others have tried, and some people seemed to even have some pretty good business strategies build around it, but the ideas have all fizzled on implementation.

But when 90% of the buyers are hoarding, you get something like gold which doesn't really work as a viable currency.

The card was bound to his gmail account.  Google is good at making sure names on cards match names on email addresses on credit cards, and that addresses on credit cards match locations that the user is logging in from etc.  He also emailed me later when his purchases started failing.

Saurik got his first million quick with cydia, so even indie appstores can be extremely successful.  Good luck to your friend, and I hope they keep bitcoin open as a good payment option :-)     so much easier than dealing with ACH

I can confirm that get-bitcoin is legit.  I have purchased a few hundred coins from them, and always gotten pretty quick delivery.

It's not feasible today, but when it is (maybe 30 years from now) newer wallets will presumably be signed with more advanced crypto, and there will likely be long abandoned wallets with significant amounts of coins in them.

Purely technical analyses are really only interesting in stable markets.  Unlike most major world currencies, I would bet that there are more humans using coins than robots.  You need to understand who these people are that are buying in and cashing out.  Who is genuinely interested is acquiring coins, and who is just using it as a way to make USD?  Fundamental analysis is critical for currencies this young, and it goes far beyond news articles. 
@_date: 2011-08-08 02:07:44
When the signing crypto gets bumped, just create a new address and move the coins.  Trivial, and you should only need to do it once every 10 years or so.  I doubt that this will ever actually effect anyone who still knows their keys.  It would only really effect wallets that have not been touched in 20-30 years.  This is how crypto works.
@_date: 2011-09-16 16:31:43
The first 4 years is still early adopter territory.  It's about getting coins out there.  As mining payouts get cut in half, the economy will stabilize.  You could argue that miners who instantly sell are better for the economy than those that hoard, since at least the coins are getting into circulation. 
@_date: 2011-09-10 19:42:05
There are a few other onion based trading areas that you have never heard of, and plenty of people willing to do contract work for BTC.

I frequently crack hashes as part of taking apart embedded devices.  Mostly though, I do some pen testing in my day job and need to crack hashes on a regular basis.  I don't do it frequently enough to set up a dedicated cracking rig, and it seems to me that people that set up rigs never really have much to crack, so setting up this website is a win win for everyone :-)

Right, gox and tradehill have been floating just below 7, and bx has maintained well above 7.  This happens when the buyers are hanging out more on bx, and the sellers are hanging out more on gox and tradehill, and the arbitrage bots work to make up the difference.
Please keep in mind as well, that google takes their 3% from my sales, I am exposed to significant fraud risks, and I have a 10 day window between when the order is placed and when I actually get paid.  As these exposures die down, I will be able to safely be able to reduce the price to even more competitive levels, but don't think for a second that what you see on realtime charts is the "real" price of any currency.

Kadaffi could send you a million dollars in Bitcoin and there isn't a damn thing you could do about it :-)
Clarification: A transaction is you using your private key and signing over some coins to someone else's public key, and then you upload it to the global block chain.

FPGAs are nice because you can use them for other things later :-)
I can confirm that the tutorial is good.  I bought and FPGA SDK with no prior FPGA experience and got the miner up and running with very few hangups (and all of them related to me porting the startup scripts to linux).
It was about 500 dollars for the board and is mining at ~50mh/s.  Not great, but definitely a fun experiment.  I just noticed the xilinx port though, so now I think things are going to get really interesting.

I'm not saying that there shouldn't be a US dollar market for bitcoins (I run one at btcnow.net).  I am just worried that so many people seem to think that bitcoin is only useful as an alternate way to send US dollars to people, and I would encourage people to think beyond that to really understand the capabilities of the currency.
@_date: 2011-08-16 08:16:24
Google actually has a very good system in place for fraud detection.  It turns out that my third customer was trying to use his girlfriend's credit card to purchase coins (he assures me it was with her permission), and the payment was rejected.  Very unexpected and happy surprise on my end for sure.
Since I am using that system (it's opt in) in theory if a chargeback does occur, google says that it will take the hit rather than me.  The program only really covers physical items that are being shipped, but anyone can subscribe to the notifications, and I am quite impressed so far.
@_date: 2011-11-17 07:44:00
We are still in the first years.  Bitcoin is less than two years old, don't forget that.

Or you can use btcnow.net and pay for the coins instantly with a google checkout account :-)
I will be lowering the price back down to 14-15 or so in the next couple days ,once my first payments start coming in from Google.

US taxes are less mandatory than you think (if you are cool with living in the woods), and tx fees are going to become more and more mandatory as volume increases and mining payout decreases.  In the future, miners' income is primarily going to be from tx fees, and there will be a huge volume of transactions to put in the chain.  If you didn't tip well enough, your transaction isn't going to be rolled into the chain that round.

The problem is that proof of works are much more difficult for these kinds of things.  The important part of this service is that it works and is extremely simple.  I'll let other people figure out how to safely distribute work to untrusted users.  I expect that some people will be setting up pools (with various trust models) and taking some off the top, but it's not a problem I want to try to tackle now.

Ha, how would an "accident" like that happen?  I think it's fun that the coins can be used like piggy banks, but that would not be a normal use case.  I'm sure one of the bitcoin mobile apps will eventually add in support to OCR a casacius coin and verify its value.

It's nearly impossible to a bitcoin merchant to scam customers, especially customers paying with credit cards.

I doubt FPGA mining will ever be cost effective, even though I have done it in the past just for kicks.  ASIC mining will only be cost effective when it can be mass produced, and I'm hoping at that point the units will be sold publicly.  Even if it's kept private for a while, designs will get out.

You do know that even the most hardened algorithms are never given more than a 10 year lifespan by NIST right?  Even ignoring the looming advancements in memristor, quantum, bio, and optical computing, there are **ALWAYS** collisions and other keyspace reductions, and implementation bugs like prng weaknesses that drastically reduce the difficulty of the problem.

I am on a 10 day payout schedule with google checkout, I have this fear that the price is going to spike between now and then :-)  After 60 days my payouts should be more regular and my paranoia will go down.

Remember that firefox and chrome browser extensions are written in javascript :-)
I suppose as long as you pay to have your applet signed, and keep that key safe, then that raises the bar a bit for injecting a fake applet, but an attacker can still upload a self signed applet with your name, and it would look pretty legit, or they could pay the money too and no one will be able to tell the difference.

Coins are not lost forever, that's not how crypto works.
It will eventually be computationally feasible to crack old wallets and move the coins to live wallets.
@_date: 2011-06-12 05:28:33
No need to panic, this is just old money cashing out.  It means there are more coins in the global market which will make the economy more stable.  As long as people are using the coins, the value will continue to increase.

If mining wasn't profitable, it wouldn't be the largest globally distributed computation network.  Obviously, since the network has dropped from 12th/s to 8th/s there are people who haven't figured out how to make it work, but why does that matter?
Truth : mining bitcoins is no longer a viable get rich quick scheme

This documents in in the API callback, it's a special notification you are going to have to listen for (in addition for new_order and charge_amount).
The payment guarantee information is here  
When you look at your orders in the web interface, you will see "Covered by Payment Guarantee".  By default, checkout **will** process orders that are not covered, but I do not.  It always makes me worried, because that notification normally comes in less than a second before the payment verified notification (when I actually send the coins) so it always feels like I dodged a bullet.
I know that I won't get the payment notification until the risk notification returns 200, so I don't think there is any actual risk but it's still scary.  This has triggered twice, and it happens on cards that will verify on any given register, but google thinks there is something sketchy about their identity information (google account name doesn't match name or location on card or something).  It's a damn fine service.
@_date: 2011-07-18 17:14:01
Sorry, the emphasis was supposed to be on "ensuring".  The way to stabilize BTC is not to peg it through another currency (which also fluctuates relative to the value of any given item).  If you are a BTC merchant, it is best to work from the perspective that BTC is stable, and it's the other world currencies that keep moving up and down.

I don't have a lot of experience with PoS coins, but isn't this what proof of stake is?  I know I never got PoS payouts unless my full node was running.
The difference is that you need to be holding a stack of coins on the node to get a payout, which is how they prevent someone from spoofing a thousand nodes.
