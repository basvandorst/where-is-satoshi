I just didn't understand why you needed to put $100 in your statement. I am actually not a BCH.BTC side shill, I do whats best for me and this drama helps no one in the crypto sector. However, facts are facts, and bitcoin has been dragging it's feet for a couple of years about some serious issues with transaction times and fees. The main reason BCH is even around and became somewhat of a cancer to the crypto-world is because bitcoin allowed itself to fall way behind.
I am glad you only lost $100 if it was only a fraction, but it seems negligible in this discussion because I am sure some people lost deep 5 figures today because of the shit that happened.

Don’t feel bad, 2013 was traumatizing. I sold 75% of my holdings at 2700 right before the bitcoin cash fork. I was way too anxious about what all would happen. I still got 6 figures in BTC but damn.....

An exchange like coinbase would benefit hundreds of time more by being honest and being/becoming the leading bitcoin exchange. 
The more people that buy into bitcoin the more money they make in transaction fees.

I feel like this is being looked at in the wrong way. Encouraging people to"hoarde" bitcoins and not spend them is not ideal for long term growth. Current holders of bitcoin need to spend the bitcoin and then rebuy the coins they spent. They need to do this at every possible purchase. 
This will cause more business accept bitcoin which will further increases bitcoin companies. Once bitcoin ATM are plentiful more and more people will become interested and say "hey it's that bitcoin thing, I'm going to buy $10 of it and see what the fuss is about. The CASUAL buyer of bitcoin is who we need to grab.
It would be so much better for 10 million people to own $10 of bitcoin than to have 100,000 users own $1000 worth of bitcoin.

You spend your bitcoin, then replace your bitcoin by buying the amount you spent. 
Example. You buy something that cost $100.00 worth of bitcoin. Then after the purchase you buy $100.00 worth of bitcoin.

I am honestly trying to buy as much bitcoin as I can within reason because I feel like bitcoin is a snowball effect. Unless the government sees bitcoin as a threat and puts all kinds of loop holes to try and supress it bitcoin will eventually blow up.
It might take another 5-10 years, but there will come a time after the next half (or maybe the following half) that bitcoins are just too damn rare to buy except in micro fractions. Companies like Google Amazon Microsoft paying part of their employee salary in bitcoin will dry up the market really fucking fast. And honestly that very well could happen if more and more businesses take bitcoin. 
Maybe I'm totally delusional and every finance guru who is circle jerking over this QE bullshit stock market would call me a retard. But when bitcoin takes over, get. Ready because it is going to take over REAL FAST.

@_date: 2014-03-20 21:31:04
It is only "bad" ( i actually dont even think its that bad)if people buy bitcoin and just sit on it. People that hold bitcoin, I urge them to spend it wherever they can and just refund your bitcoin for the amount you purchased. 
I honestly think doing this is the best way a bitcoin holder can help aid te growth of bitcoin.

I guess this might be a good place to express my current feelings about bitcoin. I really like the idea of bitcoin, the entire concept of The Fed with QE bothers me and makes me feel uneasy and I think bitcoin is a solution to some of the corruption that is happening. 
Then I take a step back and ask myself, "am I crazy, the federal reserve has some of the best economist in charge, who am I to judge what they are doing?" I don't know sometimes I feel llke I am drinking the bitcoin Kool-Aid when I get excited about some of these post, then the next day something happens and all the post are extremely negative saying bitcoin will crash and burn and we are all morons. 
Today reading all the investments going into bitcoin, how GBTC is doing, some of the big names joining/managing/funding bitcoin start ups, I mean this has to mean something right?

200K is a lot of money even to someone in their 50's. Is it mind blowing oh shit lambo money? No, but I can guarantee if anyone in their 40's/50's woke up and lost an overall networth of 200,000 they would be extremely disturbed and panic. That would not happen to someone who considers 200K a "very low amount".

Community college is free, transfer to a state school with grants and a degree is not unobtainable. Having an educated population is about what a single person puts into the education process. I have met plenty of business majors/liberal arts major who skimmed by in college and now wonder why they can't get a job. The market is flooded with Bach. of Arts and the majority of them are really not that knowledgeable about the field they studied considering they spent 4 years focused on that material.
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:11:29


There are plenty of ways to be educated without offering free college. Education on a subject matter is what you put into learning that. Requiring 4 years to "study and learn" the history of literature that is now all over the internet seems ridiculous. This is the whole problem with this education and college system. People believe that receiving a diploma is required to be labeled "educated".
If you want to discuss how the vast majority of college should be offered online and can be free, then that is one thing. However, this whole "college experience" of going to football games, and living on campus is more of a privilege and should not be labeled as an "education investment/expense"
@_date: 2016-06-29 11:16:33
Public grade schools suck enough already, drag that into college and i'm not sure how well the investment will pay off. I get having an educated population is better, but honestly the vast majority of college degrees are little to no benefit for the workforce. Thus we have an issue that students have to obtain a Masters.

So I want to start this off by saying I have a fairly large amount of my overall net worth in precious metals. 
Precious metals like gold and silver are honestly a terrible overall investment. You really won't see an amazing ROI and the only reason you would see an insane ROI is if the global financial sector went to hell.
Hypothetically if we want to put tinfoil hats on and say the global economy is on the verge of collapsing what would happen to gold/silver? Even if the price shot up would you want to trade it for paper money that is being seen as worthless? How can you go to the store and buy things with gold and silver? 
I like PM's because honestly it is a fun hobby to get into that in a sense does retain some of your "wealth". There are lots of coin series and stuff that is cool to collect and I am ok if it loses 10% here and the next year be up 10%. Collecting PM's is just a fun thing to do and it is hard to describe the feeling of owning PM's.

I know there have been several auctions for a couple hundred thousand bitcoins. That plus a possible deal with the big miners to buy off exchanges for over spot could be done easier than people in this thread are making it out to be.
@_date: 2015-07-03 04:45:19
Just curious how you predict this plays out. We are talking HUGE money if/when these tycoons feel the need to go all-in. They won't be happy with 10-20% of bitcoins in circulation, they wil want as much as they can get. So will they secretly buy small amount over time and then when the price slowly rises to 200-300% of what it currently is at they go all in and buy everything or will they still slowly collect coins. I'm thinking it's the first when it rises to 600-700 and people see a quick profit (ie 200-300^%) they go gang buster and buy everyone out.

You made a claim, send me some sources or examples because I’m 99% sure that is wrong. Stock price is determined what people are willing to pay for it. Some companies lose money and the stock goes up. 
 If anything it’s the opposite of what you claim the addition of dividends would increase th desire for the stock, raising the price. Did apples stock fall when it announced dividends? Hell fucking no

@_date: 2018-02-09 05:30:17
Last response because I honestly think you are one of the type that thinks they are right, but refuses to research their claims. Just google the question “how dividends impact stock prices”. Take Johnson&amp;Johnson, Coca Cola, and McDonalds. They have increased dividends every year and their stock continues to climb. AAPL says they are going to start dividen and guess what? Stock goes up. BUT BUT they should go down since they are giving more money away!!!
No, because companies who cut dividends... well their stock drops. Companies give dividends because they have so much fucking cash, so much that they can’t use it all to grow the company because it’s already too big. However, I guess companies having so much money that they can’t even spend it should save it, because maybe Apple should hoarse the 270 BILLION they have just sitting in the bank... using it would be a liability. 
Do some research before you continue to argue bull shit and just spew what you think is right. Skip looking up the actual truth, I’m sure you will go far... ignorance is truly bliss.

@_date: 2018-02-08 15:58:41
Dividends are from companies who have more positive cash flow than their operating cost+R&amp;D. They do not come out of the stocks price, they are based on a % of the stocks value.
