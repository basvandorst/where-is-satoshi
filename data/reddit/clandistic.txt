in my area you can pretty much find any breed you want at a shelter, there is so many and i think if one just took a trip to a shelter first, even if you have a specific breed in mind, you will without a doubt fall in love with someone there that you'll want to take to their forever home regardless of their breed or age. 
Pet shops need to stop selling animals and rather use their premises to promote shelter adoptions. Buying from a pet shop just supports breeders.

Would be great if it reached 13k by Friday, just imagine the memes.

Congrats, now Hodl. Have cash available to buy in again, it will dip but when it does, dont panic, use that advantage to buy in. have a goal in site, eg: 1BTC and work towards it.

I would maybe spend 20k now and then spend 20k after the new year, in Jan. I spent 10k usd but bought in batches over 2 months, some i bought on a high and some where it dipped (back when it was still 4k and that seemed crazy high for me). Its on a massive surge now and i suspect that will only increase on Xmas day when some people get BTC in their stockings, then in Jan, i reckon the hype will go down a bit and it'll dip? BUT, the good thing is that you are buying regardless.

Why did it dip so much in Nov 2013? It took like 4yrs to recover from that dip.

Is GDAX international, would one be able to link their bank account that is outside of US?

Why buy when you can adopt? So many at shelters looking for homes.

OR is actually thoughtful enough to visit a shelter first before buying.
