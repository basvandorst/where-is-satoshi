Most people are ignorant to how security works.  It's not simple, and exchanges make it seem simple....at the cost of security.

We need to be using private wallets, not regulation.  People unknowingly were trusting exchanges, when bitcoin as designed is immune to this crap.  People need better education on how to securely use bitcoin.

ಠ_ಠ.  Yes, I'm underestimating your ability to provide a concrete response.  I'm still of the belief this will become an eventual issue.  When the cost of technology needed to mine becomes such that only an elite few are mining, we'll be facing the 51% issue.

Yup, my $11.00

There is no way for anyone to accurately provide you an answer.  Setup a new  cold wallet anyway to be safe.
@_date: 2014-02-24 00:15:44
Isn't that the current reality?

It could explain why so little credible info has come out

Great post, i would add that it "Separates money from politics"

When you have time, you do that....I assume there was not much time.

This video is manipulation, to get buyers into the current sell off (or just really poor timing)

When the coin is in an exchange you are trusting that coin to the exchange...until you withdraw, it's not yours

The 51% problem and cost to competitively mine

The truth is, no one can be trusted.  Therefore trust yourself, be your own bank.

He's one of the first geniuses to try with crypto currency.  Doubt he'll get far without government assistance.

How is this only a problem in early years?  It is likely the number of miners is decreasing over time.  Additionally we are seeing pooling today, and less individual miners.

At least this should become the first embezzlement case where it could be 100% verified!

From the latest, It sounds like they maybe under a gag order and their accounts are frozen.

Ok, I'm retarded.  I found a resource to explain why this is unlikely in a mature block chain.

This is not exactly the answer you're looking for, but research these concepts and you'll pull together something great!
Think of bitcoin as an "app" running on the block chain.  Now realize in its current state is similar to the iPod.  Ethereum (another new thing you've likely not heard of) is the equivalent of the iTunes store.  Soon we will see the iPhone of this market.
What you should focus on is explaining the blockchain, and the power created by the idea of decentralized trust accounting.
At their own pace, the audience can put the pieces together, and see the value of bitcoin.  
- decentralized banking, no fees, nearly instant transactions, secure SHA-256, free market economics, paradigm shift

If properly educated, no one would hold the majority of their funds in an exchange.  That was the largest failure here.  
@_date: 2014-02-23 06:20:16
I agree with you on liquidity, but that is not related to the 51% problem.
