To be honest genesis mining isn't a Ponzi. A bad investment? Yes. No profit and only losses? Yes.
But you get what you buy: hashing power.

Do not preorder on businesses you do not know. Learnt this the hard way with miners.
That said, have fun.

So demand is a pyramid scheme? 
Buying stocks is a pyramid scheme?

It is a high risk investment, but the price is rising every year except the big crash (Mt. Gox bubble).
So if you are interested: set yourself a limit (what you could afford to lose) and buy a little amount every week (dollar cost average effect).

Pretty easy. You could sell it to a bigger broker like gemini or coinbase or you could sell 10 bitcoins per day at an exchange.
You could also buy a house for bitcoin if the other guy is okay with it.

Why do people buy stocks or penny stocks then?

Are you feeling good now? Never get why people shit on things. You don't like it? Okay no problem. But be a little more gentle.
What do you even expect? Downvotes? To make someone angry? Are you mad you missed Bitcoin when it was a few cents? Having stress in life?

How much do you take per minute/words? And do you do the voiceover aswell or not?

There is no endless growth and yes it does sound like a scheme when you say it like this.
BUT there is no guarantee!!! that the price of bitcoin is rising. And Bitcoin does not need new people to survive - that is false. It does not matter if bitcoin is 1 cent or 1000000 million Dollar.
Bitcoin needs miners who are "responsible" for the blockchain and those are generating new coins through a complex mathematical algorithm. The concept behind it amazes me to be honest. You could compare this to gold mining/miners.
But the price is also rising because of supply and demand. The more people get in and hold (don't sell the coins for some years) the less bitcoin are on exchanges - there are max. 21 million bitcoins available. That is just simple economics.
But you are right that you don't invest in something you don't understand. It is still a high risk to invest in Bitcoin. But look up Onecoin - countries ban it because it is a Ponzi - but they did not ban Bitcoin because there is no MLM scheme.
Hope I could help a bit :)

Hi buy the Dip, it's me, Dad.

I think that "currency" alone does not describe Bitcoin very well. A better description would be:
A high risk investment, often seen as digital gold (asset), that can be used like a currency.

Don't know but they are not supporting segwit. If you do you should switch pools.
@_date: 2017-06-12 21:10:07
All cryptos are rising as fuck. Crypto bubble or rising demand?
