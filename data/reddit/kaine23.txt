Ive noticed crypto goes up more weekends when the us markets are closed. 
Been doing this 5 months, still hodling but wary.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:04:11

404 lie not found.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:50:19
so since coinbase disabled paypal for now, to withdraw you can send it to your cash wallet or your bank account?
@_date: 2018-02-10 14:33:20
I miss having my total coinbase account up higher than it is now before the big drop. lol
