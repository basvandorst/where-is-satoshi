not sure, I placed the market order when it was falling to 19000 and in the hiccup somehow someone (a bot) placed a limit 19200 and I scooped it up.

entirely up in the air. Your guess is as good as ours.

Every sell/buy I made at Coinbase (before I heard of GDAX) went through at the amount I confirmed.

transfer the BTC to GDAX and then transfer it to your other exchange's BTC address. Should be free last time I checked.

most exchanges are first come first serve, so it goes in order of who placed the order first.
If you request a buy at a price higher than the equilibrium, then as much of your order as possible will fill as a market order up until that price point and the rest will be placed as a limit order.

because we're not psychics and can't say for sure where the bottom will be. So we spread out the buys to make it more likely we get some of the buys executed even if it doesn't drop all the way to the bottom buy.

they're processed first come first serve so if there are a lot of people selling, there might be no one left buying at 15,000 by the time yours gets processed. Assuming you mean a normal exchange. I'm not sure about on-chain exchanges, and as for Coinbase, they charge a premium on the purchase to cover any variability in the price that actually hits their exchange, GDAX.

I fomo'd at 17800 and sold at 19200

followed that rabbit hole of heirarchical wallet withdrawals a long long way and found this address that still has almost 3000 BTC (~$57 million): 
Was active as recently as September 2017

Oh, if you're talking about Coinbase rather than GDAX, then not sure. Sometimes they take a good bit of time to process direct coin purchases. But they're guaranteed at the price they show you as far as I know.

GDAX login is the same as Coinbase.

the trick is to have invested $100 in 2011 and misplaced the private key until 2017

stop limit order is ok too. it's the stop market order that contributed to the crash.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:35:25
Sure, assuming that the price does indeed recover completely
@_date: 2018-11-25 17:26:05
lightning probably

why can't it just be textbook mass adoption theory?
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:25:51
I definitely agree. I would add that you could add in mega-satoshis too for more expensive items.
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:24:42
That's good news for me, I suppose. Less supply.

You need to get some financial planning people to set up a will for your descendants to use your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:24:52
how is that determining "on track"? Linear model? Parabolic?

If bitcoin is ever worth $1 million I just feel like there will have to have been a full financial shift to cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:46:46
Yeah, definitely. I just mean I am in favor of popularizing the use of a unit other than a full bitcoin.

by that point in time, the reference to dollars and cents will be useless because the dollar will cease to exist.
