But if you read my post, it shows that they said they were working on a solution. I just wanted to know if there was any progress on that.

How does that work? I tried importing the 24 word mnemonic into a Mycelium wallet and no luck. It shows a 0 BTC balance when in fact it is 5 BTC in GreenAddress.

Thanks for getting in touch. I think there is one way you can be sure that I am not an attacker: I can sign a message using the PGP key that was associated with the account. Let me know what you think.

The wallet always demands the 2 factor auth token for any actions. Supposedly the way around it is to use the nLockTime feature. However, that feature depends on having an email address associated with the wallet. However, adding an email address now requires the 2 factor auth token.

I've tried contacting them in various ways including email, Twitter and GitHub. On GitHub they specifically ignore my ticket but respond to others.

I tried following that guide but I run into the same 2-factor issue because at some point I have to send the funds out of the original wallet into the new 2of3 wallet before recovering them.

I just wanted to publicize my experience with GreenAddress thus far. Thanks for the link to the FAQ.

I set up 2FA and let the wallet sit for 6 months. I eventually had a friend send money into it but I forgot that I had since upgraded my Android version (which deleted Google Authenticator). So anyone can send money into the wallet but no money can leave the wallet. There is no way to recover because I did not connect an email address to the wallet. I have since started using [Authenticator Plus]( which survives an OS upgrade.

It's been so long that I've since lost hope. There are just small bursts of hope when the bitcoin price goes up. The cost of fighting them in court is too high considering the price of the wallet. Maybe if it rises above 15K again. I'm considering suing Blockstream in the US since it would be cheaper.
