Hey all, Our app is now live (post-whitelist) in the US. Yah, there are other round-up apps out there...that said, there are some features we'll be rolling out soon that we think will help w/ improving the avg. profitability of longer-term accounts. Eager to get feedback - what's good / what we should change - please let us know!

Hey all, Built this fully functional web app. The waitlist is just for demand planning and we bulk whitelist on a regular basis. Any feedback, questions, comments are welcome!

Currently it's BTC only but we're open to changing that depending on user feedback. Which ones in particular would you want to see added? We're currently sourcing from major US exchanges though we're considering adding others when we launch in other markets.

Yah, definitely we are planning on adding support for arbitrary email sign ups probably at some point in the next month or so... The gmail only option has provided for a very nice, super quick sign up experience so that's one reason we've started there.

Thanks for the feedback! We'll likely add ETH as the next one, and may be rolling out others over the next few releases. We'll keep you posted.

Thanks for letting us know! Should be working now, but please let us know if that's not the case on your end.
