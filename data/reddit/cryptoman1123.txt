Coinbase pro has really nice fee rates, just one has to use it. I really like their business model, if you are stupid, pay the fees, if you are smart and use pro, you get almost 0 fees.  
Do your own research or pay for stupidity...

Pls tell me you haven't used your real reddit account for this.  
Or if you did, then you have never ever posted anything that can be linked to you IRL.  
Think about this, and decide if you want to show off with your ballance. Remember, this is the money of the dark net, there is no kyc after an 5 $ wrench attack...

One wallet can have multiple public addresses  see [this]( . According to the [blockstream explorer]( that address has received bitcoins ( 0.04225494 BTC ). 
  
Sometimes wallets only show transactions that have certain amount of confirmations, so either the wallet did not show it because of this, or he is trying to scam you :(.
Also, whenever you post something bitcoin related I'd advice you to use a throwaway reddit account to avoid the 5$ wrench attack.

I'd say you should come up with a limit, lets say 60k/coin and then sell x percent of all your holdings. Lets say 20%. This way you will get back your house and have enough to get to the moon. Hope you succeed, God Bless!

Why not use a mixer in order to wash it clean and then do whatever he wants?
@_date: 2019-10-15 11:31:09
If you don't know the answer to that question, then you shouldn't. This is not just bitcoin specific thing, whatever you invest in, if you need such advice then you are not prepared.  
Do your own research, invest when you don't need advice, believe me, you will hold trough dips if you know into what you have invested and why.

I've just found this recently, watched like 5 videos so far, as far as I can tell this is the best technical playlist ever. Send me other if you feel like you have better :)

This sounds like an excellent idea, also a big bitcoin tattoo, and maybe some facebook posts with your address and bitcoin related information.   
If I were a criminal and I'd like to know who has got some sats I'd advertise something like this ( not saying that you are, just saying that you are kinda unexperienced when it comes to OPSEC  )

Please don't share personal information when you share stuff about crypto.
ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU NEVER POST WITH YOUR MAIN ACCOUNT!
You can get yourself robbed killed and stuff... Just google it, this is serious! Also never brag about crypto.  
Edit:  
Take care kid, I'am proud of you :)

Actually your alts are not loosing hard. They stay on the same value while btc's value goes up. So basically you are not loosing your alts, nor money, you are just loosing BTC.
For me the thing that changed my mind from alts to btc was the fact that I've realized with holding alts I wanted to reach higher profit, just because i wanted to get more BTC in the end of the day. ( After loosing a lot by trying to time the market, and breaking even thanks to Roger Ver's operation dragonslayer... I went full btc and never looked back )

I think it overestimates it. Currently it shows 88/byte for fast but according to  [ there are 1300ish 70+ sat/byte transactions. With this in mind if I'd have to make a transaction i'd put it for 60 ish sat/byte.  And i'm pretty sure that would clear in the next hour whereas your meter displays 72 to 3 hour. Since I have not verified this, it is mere speculation.
I'd say you could tweak the algorithm a bit more.Anyway good luck with it, it's a nice thing for the community
Edit: made some changes because i failed to read the graph for the first time :D
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:03:27
Note: there is only 18 sat/byte difference now in my intuitive prediction, and your program. But I wonder what would happen if the fees were that high as they used to be back in 2017 december

You clearly don't get it. In order to fix "double spend" problem, exchanges should use MORE confirmations NOT LESS. In order to double spend you have to make a transaction, on the currently longest chain, then get x confirmations so the exchange accepts it, fast cash out on exchange, get more than x blocks on sidechain so you earn the longest chain. Simply put with more required confirmations, you'd have to get more blocks in order to do "double spend"
Not sure if this is called double spend. I mean it could since the traditional one does not exists when it comes to bitcoin.  
Also, not sure if you know what double spend really is, and how to profit or loose money with it

Crypto backed loans would mean an end for anyone :D Just imagine you take a mortage loan for 20 years backed in crypto, lets say you have to pay back 5 btc. Then halvings come and you will never ever be able to pay back that 5 btc. But it will be a nice story for the grandkids, somehting like this: "I took an 5 btc loan back in 20xx and now I could buy Albania Romania and Greece combined with that much money"
