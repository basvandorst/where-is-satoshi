I received the same email. I have never used my PayPal account for cryptocurrency transactions so I was confused how I got flagged. I contacted their support through their chat and was given the same response that this was fake. All emails coming from paypal will be service and not paypal I was asked to forward the email to spoof so they could review it and would update on any further recommendations.

I've seen IBM with blockchain commercials. Seems very odd of them to have anything to do with something that promotes FUD of cryptocurrencies.
