I think your criticism of fiat is wrong, it's like saying "bricks are no good because assholes build houses". There's nothing wrong with a society saying "this is acceptable for the paying of taxes" while pointing at something... essentially that's all "fiat" is. I dunno, maybe you're against taxes, but if you ask me the problems we have in the financial system today are (as usual) about power. When everyone used gold and silver the problems were still about power, and in future if everyone uses crypto-currency.... I think the miners have shown that it will always be about power, regardless what you paint numbers on and accept for goods and services (who controls the paint, who says what denominations, who controls the place where the things to have numbers painted on them come from, who has commit rights, who has the force to just take them or just take the things you're trying to buy instead of messing about with numbered-things, whatever they are... etc) .

Great post, and I agree. I stopped taking an interest in the politics of bitcoin when I realised that how the money is run isn't what makes any difference to the power structure. Power dictates everything, communist or capitalist, theocracy or fascist there's always a powerful 1 percent that sit at the top and pretty much do what they want. Cryptopia would be no different.
@_date: 2017-08-31 11:51:08
I reckon armies are moved by the exact same two forces that move markets: Greed and Fear. I'm pretty sure that Power is perfectly capable of making for itself a good home in any market-system. In the book Debt: And the First 5000 Years the case is made that the market was actually created by centers of political power. With the invention of the market- it was no longer necessary for the King (let's say) to arrange for all the material needs of his army through centralised management, instead he could just melt down plundered gold and distribute coins to the troops, where all in the land controlled by the king have to acquire a certain amount of these coins every year or something horrible would be done to them it becomes easy for a soldier to make his own arrangements. If I recall correctly the system could even be run on bits of wood (tally sticks are actually pretty cool in my opinion- the information is what really matters, not shiny pretty metal- turns out wood grain makes for a pretty good authenticated ledger system, that was more about tax collection though, rather than markets and mediums of exchange).

Don't get me wrong, I haven't needed to read your link to know what you mean (beleive me I know enough about that sort of thing, World Bank, IMF, WTO, NAFTA, theEU, NATO... I'm always pointing these things out to people who hate on 'economic immigrants' as to what decades of all this and neo-colonialism have done to the global South such that the people are forced to follow the money to the capitals to which all wealth flows and become rightless immigrant dish-cleaners... but usually the Alt-Right "SJW!" screeching idiots aren't big on joined-up thinking enough and just want to feel like the '*real* victims'- anyway all that's another thread).
But even without the current structures, Power will make new structures to ensure that it remains Power. Isn't that precisely what we've see happening in crypto recently? Cryptopia is no safer from Power than any other form. On paper, just like Communism- fiat currency used by a democracy should be a perfectly decent system to be getting on with, or you could use Gold if you want, why not. It's not really about the money, it's about things like Power and who controls distribution, the system or "the people".
@_date: 2017-08-04 10:53:37
Sure it could hurt demand... but ultimately that would be good for the environment, the life-bearing atmosphere and seas... a switch from a debt driven system to a savings-driven system would also lead to less debt as a necessary part of the system I guess, less of a ceaseless hunger for expansion, more capable of a more sustainable "steady state system"... so choose your liquid.
@_date: 2017-08-31 09:38:10
In the hierarchy of these things, Power is above Money. Power clicks it's fingers and Money comes running. Money buys what it wants but Power takes what it wants. Money has no value if Power doesn't enforce the contracts Money is involved in. What Power says is now Money- is now Money even if wheel-barrows are involved.

My impression was that Einstein and Chaplin (like all the finest minds) were both Socialish/Leftish? 
*"I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society."

I disagree with the fancy new coin talk, many of these other coins are fast because they don't have the same volume. but aside from that, fancy new knobs and whistles don't necessarily mean a better coin, there are more features to potentially be gamed for example, and there's certainly more to test. Additionally a cryptocoin is not just the technology, it's also the "fan-base" (I consider the Bitcoin Religion to be amongst the strongest out there... possibly giving actual Religion Religions a ru for their money in terms of pure fanaticism and vision) the politics, the balance of interests and the cultural... thing. Tech is just the tip of the iceberg. And anyway the UNIX principal is in my opinion a large part of the reason why Bitcoins first-mover advantage has been so well made use of (do one 'simple' thing, do it very well). A lot of the knobs and whistles on other coins wouldn't do well in a fight like one of the bitcoin communities nasty ideological jihads for example.

I guess I'm taking the piss out of something that does seriously kind of bother me about Libertarians. You see, essentially I get the impression that Libertarians just plain don't like humanity. They don't like being part of a community of people, they don't like paying taxes for common goods, they don't believe in the concept of common-goods, they seem to overall resent the fact they have to share the planet with anyone else at all and disaprove of any interaction between 'economic participants' that is not transactional via the Sacred Metal of 'sound money' because all over forms of human interaction that don't involve sound money is a plot by Marxists  after their precious bodily fluids probably. 
Anyway these are my impressions, they are only impressions mind... but every time I read this forum I see a hand full of messages that reinforce that perception. No biggy, who cares right? I am allowed to express my thoughts on the matter right? Apologies if I have in any way interfered with your Galt given right to misanthropic sociopathy as a principal and that you have to live in a society with collectivist wretches that just want to keep the libertarian superman down.

I just don't see the CCP viewing crypto-currency as some sort of existential threat is all, perhaps a source of potential inconvenience for awhile. Anyway even in Roman times, the 'worlds' gold strongly tended to migrate to China over time, the same pattern happened to all that gold the Spanish plundered from the Americas, and even happened during the British Empire which is why Britain went to war to force them to buy Indian grown opium so Britain would have something to redress the silver trade-imbalance with China. We've seen that with T-Bills, and even with Bitcoin, China just keeps turning out to be something of an economic gravity well for world trade, like a big fat money-Jupiter. Whatever happens, my bet is that China will do all right regardless of what we chose to buy things from them with. I doubt they'll bother trying to control Bitcoin as was described, they do well enough just to be China and "hodl" as far as the patterns of world trade are concerned.

Core is a fundamental shift on the layer beneath all cash, it's true digital gold. fuck coffee, what about my life savings? In my opinion the way things are shaping up makes sense. Cash will also have to contend with L2 payment solutions built on Core though but that's fine, payment processors should have to compete with each other. Core as settlement layer is about more than companies competing with each other for Profit, Core is a revolution of Power.

Libertarians just don't seem to grok anything outside of what they think money is about and also slagging off the Fed.

I called my idea, "The Super-Dollar".
Hodlers keep the supply of bitcoin tight, they buy up what they can and park-it off the system, releasing it again only for the things in life more important to them than money. You got a problem with that? Why not go use.. dodge or something.

The media is doing their bit, the economics and sanctions guys are doing their bit, the military guys based over in neighbouring Colombia have been waiting and stand ready and the internal 'opposition' of Venezuela's 1% stands ready too as they did back when they tried (but failed) to coup Chavez. When it happens it will be a "spectacular" again, the narrative being as is the usual method about brave people that just want their freedom heroically resisting the evil horrible government that responds to their calls for change with tanks and sniper rifles and police beatings. Like with Ukraine we might even get to see that narrative outlined even as we are shown images of cops armed with batons and shield being set on fire by masked men sporting fascist symbols and armed with Molotov cocktails, chains, axes, guns and shields of their own. They'll probably even also wave flags and banners all produced in the identical tens of thousands by the same mysterious supplier. Y'know, like usually.
I'm pretty sure Venezuela's government is making all sorts of mistakes and misjudgements, meaning that the country probably will not fair well because Monroe's wolf is at their door.

It continues to astound me the kind of people Americans think are "left wing". Of the names listed, only Bernie is an actual self-described socialist, the rest are right-wing neo-liberals of various kinds who've never given a flying fuck about the working class. To Clinton, blue-collars are 'despicable' input factors for the business interests of her Saudi and variously corporate friends- until their jobs can all be robotized and done away with anyway. Then they can be encouraged into the military to go fight one of the many interventionist adventures she's always in support of to make the world safe for Capital.

There's been talk of Russia moving to a gold-backed rouble, they've been buying up gold for years now and it's well known that the Americans don't like Russia- so it's in Russias interests to move away from the dollar. If they do move towards a golden-rouble then I don't think they have so much to fear from crypto. They might still have concerns about crypto but those concerns may well be addressed by the optimal strategy of just having more than anyone else- or at least more Bitcoin for instance than their ill-wishers do. Crypto-mercanctlism could become a thing, a thing that Russia is already making a start on while China (also into gold) seems to have got wrong and is currently holding upside down with crazy ideas about making their own central-bank tardy-database internet-money.

Perfect example of how one mans poorly thought out and terribly bad idea can be immediately implemented by millions of people with no critical interference whatsoever. To give them their due, I don't think the CCP make that sort of blunder any more, it's a very conservative and bureaucratic organization now and that's a good thing I think, no Glorious Leaders any more- just pragmatists that wear suits and attend meetings a lot. China it seems to me is balancing the risk of missing-out on early domination of bitcoin with the risks that bitcoin poses to the Chinese economy and political order, they're right to take the matter seriously. In Chinese history, the standard body-count of a bit of political bother and strife with underlying economic causes is usually in the multi-millions. Like that guy who reckoned he was Jesus Christs brother, something like 30 million dead once the dust had settled. Let China be boring and conservative and choose stability over innovation if they think they must, the costs the Chinese pay when they get something wrong are... alarmingly high in volume.

That every coin they spent represents an uncapped opportunity cost. I remember a freind telling me about how her boyfreind was using Silk Road, and knowing that I enjoy the flower she asked if I had used that service yet. I told her I considered Bitcoin far too valuable to spend on drugs. That was like four years ago, the other month I met her boyfreind at a party and asked him how he felt about Silk Road, Bitcoin etc. 
In Britain we say "gutted" for the feeling of profound dissapointment, defeat or loss, and that's the word he used... "gutted", you could almost see long glistening coils of gut spilling from his belly. A few mushrooms a few years ago cost him tens of thousands of pounds he could have had now. You gotta spend Bitcoins at some point or what's the point- but better something really important, a home you own for example, or I once spent a couple coins to take my partner on a holiday and propose to her... you know, the sort of things that are more important to you than money although needing money to facilitate. Use disposable fun-budget fiat income for the likes of drugs. Or better yet- grow your own flower.

Actually, white-supremacists tend to hate America too, but only because they thnk it's run by the jooz. Anyway who cares what the Alt-Right etc think, they're idiots. 
I also think there's too much China-bashing where other idiots don't even know whether they're talking about the people or about the governments policies... frankly I don't think they care. Try not to forget how racist the West is generally, we've mostly learnt it's not cool to be overtly racist against black people who are also Westerners... but when China, Russia or the likes of Iran comes up it becomes obvious how closely Western racism works with the policies and objectives of Western governments... it's like the original purpose of why industrial-scale racism was constructed in the first place, except this time not to grap land and kill off the poeple living there, or to enslave millions and turn their flesh into sugar and cotton for the European market in coffee, cake and nice-threads... but rather to boost NATO spending, control the middle east, and lay claim to the right to run the South China Sea or whatever throat through which the Chinese economy breaths. Only the other week an American General was telling us how "Russians are genetically inclined to fuck around with US elections"- not an exact quote but those are the lines along which this guy is thinking. We in the West are racists, we always have been- don't be surprised at how eaily we slag-off the Chinese as a people.

Your culture is American (probably). Islam has sold all sorts of people into slavery, actually by the track record- Africans are their favourite to buy and sell (where do you think Europeans got the idea?) And even today Qattar does a roaring trade in Indian workers and Philipino women. It's not really a surprise for a religion that seems to worship a cosmic slave-holder in the sky. But then all religions practice all sorts of awful crap- most people in day to day life just try to ignore the whackier pronouncements of whatever holy book their lumbered with and get on with life like sane people. Alt-Righters have far more in common with Wahabists and other genocidal supremacist weirdos trying to lay some sort of claim to the artifacts of nature than they do the rest of us.

Saving is a perfectly legitimate use-case for Bitcoin, who are you to judge. It's still an economy if people just want to acquire Bitcoins and hodl.

It does. The history of Europe is centuries of white christian people beating the shit out of each other (thirty years war, hundred years war, inumerable shorter wars, slavery, genocide, the crusades also marched East where they slayed hundreds of thousands...). I don't like islamification either, but this Alt-Right noise that comes storming out of America is just consistently fucking retarded. Never has the need to colour-code life been so blatantly the preference for the simple minded. Colour-code and big letters spelling words of one syllable. And yet when it comes to opposing the wars that generate refugee floods, when it comes to opposing the economic policies that collapse peoples ability to see a future for themselves in the homelands where they were born because all the wealth and sovereignty is hauled out to London or Paris or New York (and this too because of the banking elite and neo-liberalism that even the broken-clock Alt-Right aren't too keen on) where are these muppets then? Nowhere, because for them life is a simple matter of melanin count and nothing more. fuckwits. Americans are mostly responsible because none of them even know what identity is, it's all just a load of Disney Land nonesense. "I'm Irish" or something, they will say. No, you're not Irish, you're from Boston and have fuck all idea how life is lived in Ireland. You're an American- thus it's possible for you to think "white people invented everything cool" because for you wallowing in your utter ignorance of history outside your bloated imperialist burger-spewing country is an act of pride, so fuck off with your "identity" that you think you have.
