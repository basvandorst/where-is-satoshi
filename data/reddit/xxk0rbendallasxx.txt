The non-tangible aspect is not the problem. The problem is it's driven by scarcity which isn't backed by anything tangible (unlike gold stock). While the internet isn't palpable, it does however offer our species wealth of knowledge (which is priceless). Movies/video games at the beginning of development may not be tangible, but the end product however is (you won't loose a game or movie, unless you sell it). Investing in scarcity is not a bad thing (precious metals, diamonds, etc), as long as you have something to show for it.

When you see one individual shifting the charts of all four crypto currencies on coinbase...of course it's going to be a bubble. Non-tangible scarcity is a ridiculous investment.

You're a smart man, the IRS is not to be messed with. If the government wanted to stop bitcoin...trust me, they could. Just like Russia and China.

That's the thing though, governments can take it away (they simply deny access to it). The difference between gold and crypto, is that gold will always be worth something, even if everyone else unloads their shares. If you are the last to unload your bitcoin...it will literally be worth nothing (while gold and other precious metals can be used to make other tangible products). Also, crypto is becoming regulated. Governments are now creating their own or simply taxing everyone on their transactions. If you use coinbase for your transactions, I highly recommend you pay your taxes to the IRS (they will be cracking down hard going forward).

Your examples are tangible, bitcoin is not. It's much harder (almost impossible) to regulate physical objects than cryptocurrencies. The end of net neutrality is a step in this direction (of course, "if", it happens).
