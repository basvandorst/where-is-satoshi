Why did you multiply with 6\*24? You need to divide by that to see how many days you need.

When I saw the title I was opening Kraken and this in the same time, ready to panically market sell everything.

Main network should only allow putting and getting money from LN. That would reduce contention, as it would make majority of transaction processed on LN.

That is the problem with the big blocks, you can see that a lot on BCash. The miner starts mining headers while waiting for transactions to download and after they are downloaded then they mine the block with transactions. Every once in a while they will be lucky to mine an empty block while downloading transactions. If block is big that would happen to often and that is the problem in going to that direction. Lightning network is the way to go!

I am aware of that but after each block is generated you need to download it to see which transactions are already in the blockchain so while you are waiting for that to download you start mining on the header only. It is a very very short time to download the whole block but enough time to have some empty blocks mined once in a while.

So many benefits of crypto will be gone, like anonymity. So no difference than the system now, except that if I am allowed to use only certain wallets and government can track all my transactions, because of the public ledger.

That is called a fractional reserve and it will also work with crypto in the same way. You can create money that way and if there is a run on the banks that is when everything will collapse.

So, I have a full-time job and I want a mortgage, can I get that from a peer-to-peer platform? Or a car loan? And if I decide not to give back the money spent, how will that p2p platform get its money back?
The point is, the banks will continue to exist but they might use crypto instead of fiat money.

No? You mean, I will be able to earn for my house from one monthly salary? I don't think so. I think that I would need someone, call it p2p platform to lend me the money/bitcoins that I can repay. You know who lends the money? The banks.
@_date: 2019-05-13 10:00:24
But what is then the difference between lending fiat vs bitcoin? The p2p platform that would give me a loan is the same as the bank.
And what do you mean by blockchain credit record? I would use a different unknown wallet belonging to someone I know, or I will create a new one.
