But it is an attack. How do you think governments get away with everything every single time? Because they always spin everything and the population falls for it over and over again.
It's the same exact pattern and yet populations never seem to evolve from this.

No, in order to manipulate price they set the price in futures and that futures price-point influences the actions of traders who try to keep ahead of the market, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.

This is another attack on crypto - using "ratings agencies" to try and influence emotional sentiment.
If they lower the rating, it lowers the confidence people may have in the crypto. They can manipulate the ones they love and hate by influencing sentiment. Once you understand how banking/government works at the highest levels, social control is their key objective:
Investors with deep pockets will be particularly easy to influence as they will be looking for signs that their investment is "quality" and if they trust the ratings agencies then they may end up swayed against it.

You're not considering emotional sentiment. When the Weiss ratings were released this week, all the top dapp coins listed went up between 5 - 25%.
In total that is BILLIONS of dollars flowing into them. All based upon a ratings agency that nobody has heard of before.
This shit definitely matters, futures manipulate emotional sentiment and that is a big issue.

But with POW people can still technically enter mining with more money and bring in new competition. Whether or not one or the other is more centralized now, at least it is theoretically possible with POW.

A deflationary spiral only sucks for the little guy (and broader economy). An example of this was during the Great depression where everything was basically closed because there was very little business, and everything (such as factory equipment) sold off very cheap relative to the dollar to pay the bills.
The wealthy did very well during this period, as they could purchase goods and services very cheaply and in vast quantities from the hoards of desperate lower and middle classes who'd do anything for a dollar to survive. Those who held dollars prior, or who still had access to making more of it made a killing due to the deflation.
Saying that BTC is bad due to deflation is wrong. That's fiat banker propaganda. I'm sure there will be a point where BTC hodlers would release their BTC during a "deflationary spiral", especially if you could buy 10 houses for 1 BTC or whatever - there would be a point where people would trade BTC for other stuff. Every hodler during a deflation has their price.
@_date: 2018-03-26 07:35:21
Man you gotta do your own research on fiat currencies. Look up **fractional reserve banking** on youtube or something. The way fiat works is that only a small fraction of your savings are actually stored in your bank account, and the rest has been loaned out as credit for credit cards, mortgages, car loans. It's not sustainable.
There is so much wrong with fiat currencies today and the community that started this whole Bitcoin thing knew all this and these days all you noobs know fuck all haha, go watch a few documentaries on central banking and all the stuff they do, there is so much wrong with today's banking system and Bitcoin is a path to liberation from these legacy banking systems.

Credit is not free. Credit is created by transferring wealth away from the savings of savers into the pockets of people to spend via credit/loans.
So what this post actually means is that $71 trillion more of other peoples money has been spent since 2007.
With fractional reserve banking, the bank only stores 10% of your savings, they lie to you by showing your full balance but the truth is they have actually lent it to others to spend with as credit.
**Quantitative easing is spending other peoples savings to prop up the economy.**
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:10:45
It's the same concept of wealth transfer. Quantitative easing is not "free". You can't just magically print food, cars, materials and energy into existence by clicking digits on a computer. That is literally impossible or else we could all have free food and stuff forever and there would be no problem here.
What is actually happening is that stored wealth is being transferred through a complex financial system from savers to spendors as credit/loans. 
I dislike people like you that act like you're knowledgeable when you have no clue at all.

POS means that future token issuance is monopolised to those who already own a larger share of the network. If they don't sell, they will always own priority over new issuance of tokens. 
At least with POW a new player could enter the market with more powerful mining equipment or cheaper power. Although difficult, it's still a possibility and this ability for continued competition is incredibly important.

There are much better memes out there, much much better. I also didn't care about the picture at all, i just responded to your comment. At least we now have a somewhat informative discourse that has occurred underneath in the comments here.
Energy is a big concern for me too. That's why you hedge BTC with Gold. Gold matters because the Elite think it does, the old money. They love it. And when it's already mined out of the ground there is very little energy upkeep if you bury it in the ground or whatever. 
The internet won't die, because then the surveillance apparatus fails, and that won't ever happen. Centralized mining might actually be good for BTC in that it means those with access to cheap energy (such as hydro-electric dams etc) take responsibility for maintaining the network.
If the security apparatus wants to keep an eye on people (and not lose control of society), it will need the internet at all costs, which means they will find a way to provide electricity  to homes somehow.

You can predict the price by trading the underlying asset - if you think it is going down you sell, or up you buy. We don't need to create an artificial futures mechanism to do that.
If you truly understood the futures market you would know that they are incredibly damaging to the average person (and society) because it gives banks the ability to manipulate and thus control prices of crucial resources (in their favour).
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:44:35
1% growth with a stake size of 20% is a lot more (cumulatively and compounding) than 1% of a 1% stake. 
Perhaps my example was rather crude, but over the long-haul those with a larger stack have an unfair competitive advantage over future token issuance and once that point is reached where the remainder of tokens available for sale is less than the amount being held by early investors, there's no way to enter the market on an equal footing - you can't compete.

"*Fractional-reserve banking* is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities."

A lot of people don't like that banks spend $90 out of every $100 they deposit into a bank, with Bitcoin nobody is loaning out your coins, so your money is still there at the end of the day and not being used to prop up the housing market or stock market.

You missed the point. By investing in Bitcoin you are removing yourself from the fractional reserve banking system.
When you open your Bitcoin wallet and see 1 BTC, there will always be 1 BTC there and nobody else controls the access accept yourself with your own keys.
However with a fiat bank account a majority of your money is being loaned out (to support the consumption of others via debt), with only a fraction of it actually held as a reserve. So if this debt bubble goes, so may your savings.

Inflation is the next step. One part of this rampant inflation occurs because peoples savings are being issued out as loans/credit which means everyone gets a mortgage or car loan and this inflates/raises the price of those assets due to the increased demand of those assets relative to how much money you earn or you have saved in the bank.

Yes but as we know there are very deleterious elements (and given the choice many people would prefer their savings were not used for investment in asset bubbles), for example during a market crash in the cycle of a market, when everything valued in debt has reached a peak e.g. sub prime real estate, it starts to crash. The savings in reserve (fractional reserve) are so small they cannot support the crash in price of all the inflated asset classes. This knock- on effect can result in reprecussions, such as bank "bail-ins" where a bank can use up the reserve of peoples savings to catch the fall (bank insolvency), leaving little savings left in the banks for people to withdraw.
The classic historical context of this occurring is called a "bank run" whereby people line up at ATMs to withdrawal their cash in order to protect their wealth.
Savings are a backbone of an economy and modern economics has done a good job of promoting credit over wealth accumulation. i personally would rather my own savings remain just savings, in order to reduce risk that my wealth is wiped out or devalued in a crisis.

I just read the synopsis of that and it does nothing to alleviate the fact that real-world examples of financial crisis do occur and people are impacted regardless of "emotional sentiment". I'm not interested in herd behaviour, i'm interested in a savings vehicle *that sits outside of the banking system*.
Also I disagree with your second paragraph (this whole currency vs storage of wealth argument), you sound like a Bcash kinda guy but I will post my belief on what Bitcoin is.
Storage of value in the purest sense is money that:
**a)** retains value over time and
**b)** increases in value over time (deflationary).
*This is why Gold is a tier 1 asset (see "Exter's pyramid") despite never being used to buy groceries, coffee, entrance fees to clubs or pay bills. Storage of value rates higher than medium of exchange, otherwise fiat would be considered better than gold for reserve purposes but it isn't, (it's trash for storing wealth e.g. housing, healthcare and food all increasing comparatively) but makes an excellent medium of exchange - the functions are seperated.*
*Most Cryptos are probably both, but private storage of wealth is more critical at this point in time as we already have fiat and credit for shopping but not many avenues for savings that outpace inflation.*
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:51:13
The more debt a nation accumulates, the higher the interest payments. Without perpetual infinite growth this burden of repayments becomes untenable. What you are proposing is infinite growth and that is simply not possible - which is why many like myself plan to hedge against future risk by investing in **an asset class that sits outside of the banking system**.
I have already stated quite clearly the clear risks here but you have failed to digest them. An argument is not won by linking me to a Central Bank website - the fact you cite the Federal Reserve is a clear demonstration to me that you are following the herd narrative.

Because with Bitcoin you hold the keys to your stash, the bank and nobody else can access these Bitcoins of yours unless you give them your password.
Meaning that these Bitcoins cannot be loaned out. They stay in your address where you left them.
They have tried and failed to create a futures market for this purpose - people are waking up to the tricks.
