Mark is eating my ass right now. He told me to tell you "mhmhmmmhmmmhmhmh."
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:22:01
most people didn't exactly know that at the time. They say "no... they could never get away with that!"
The difference here is that we do know.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:04:44
what makes you an authority on what someone knows and doesn't know?
I myself, truthfully heard about this 3 years ago from someone that was inside btc-e reading their mail. But unlike OP, I knew it would fall on deaf ears. So, each to his own. We are all in it for

how in the fu... I don't want to know.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:08:47

Not really idiots, they just didn't know 80% of bitcoiners are thieves.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:14:17
Before I got into bitcoin, I had never seen so many people, so willfully ignorant in my entire life. They give the benefit of the doubt to any fool on the street as long as it might mean there's money in it for them. This is how so many of these stupid motherfuckers get scammed, and it's funny because bitcoin will eventually make counterfeiting obsolete.
I can manipulate these people so easily with lies, because they love being lied to. But the people that come around actually telling the truth.... you're the fucking ENEMY!
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:02:52
Because it's true. It's so sad that willful ignorance of the masses will silence OP. Just like all the warnings about MTGOX.

would you like to suck on my giant bag of dicks?
just say yes.
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:34:25
see, that's the difference between me and you.
You care, I don't, why would I give out verifiable inside information, for free?
See, you give out your benefit of the doubt, like obama gives out welfare.
are you willfully ignorant like 100's of millions of others? YES you are. 
you like all the others, give out your benefit of the doubt like it's your duty.
and criminals LOVE this, because they run freeeeeeeee!!

That's the arbitragers job. It works against volatility.
@_date: 2014-03-03 05:05:11
you're == you are.
I see you need to go out and explore the other subs, because you clearly just violated an important rule, and problem is you are on reddit.

I know it's on everyone's minds, so I'm just going to get it out here.
How in the fuck do we get free bitcoins by filing false info???
We need to get in on this QUICK! Let's setup a brainstorming session. I WANT MY MONEY AND I WANT IT MEOW

reality check. keiser is also an idiot and doesn't know what he's talking about; these morons are eating it up.

Don't beliebe me? Check the paper!
@_date: 2014-03-04 11:40:47
I guarantee no one here will get anything.
@_date: 2014-03-03 06:37:22
because the bitcoin foundation is a scam, and gavin should go with those two. They are probably the only smart ones in it. Them leaving makes them both look reputable. After all that has happened they are the only two out of all of them I would trust. Everyone knows or should know the bitcoin foundation regularly conducts business with known criminals and unsavory types like black hat thieves.

have a nice day, I love you.

Dazzling Greed, I am constantly reminded how much they deserve it, just because they need to learn.
