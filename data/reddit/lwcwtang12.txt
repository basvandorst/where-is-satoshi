The idea of exchanges being judicious is in itself inherently anti-crypto. If crypto represents libertarian ideals and a decentralized future in which no central power dictates what is bought and sold on the open and free market then exchanges picking and choosing what can and can't be allowed on the market and readily available to consumers is wrong. The future is truly decentralized exchanges that can't say who's allowed on the market and say yeah pay us $70,000 and we'll list you. It's up to the consumer to do due diligence.
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:33:00
Yes... I'm obviously talking about ideals and a potentially impossible future, but I think exchanges playing the god role in determining what can and can't be listed is a pathway to a dangerous situation/future. Decentralized exchanges are something I think we should at least strive for.
Edit: I think that there is a world in which fair regulation and an open market can coexist. When I say open market I do not mean an anarchist state. I don't want markets where the coins available are only there because they bought there way. I want a market where the best products win because they're the best. Also, you really come across as condescending., but whatever, everyone is a know-it-all in these crypto subs.
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:26:27
Hahahah lmfao
@_date: 2019-07-26 18:28:29
No, I want decentralized exchanges and centralized exchanges to coexist in a free market so consumers can choose which they want. I will be choosing the version where products (coins, tokens, etc.) are not listed because they purchased their way onto the exchange. I prefer to do my own due diligence in determining which coins are truly the best products and not let the centralized exchange predetermine my choices to an extent. This issue came to light recently with BSV. Am I going to buy BSV? Absolutely not. Should it be delisted? No. I can think for myself.

There are a number of them that are decent. I'll admit many are in infancy with low volume. I'm more referring to an ideal future that may not ever come to fruition. I do hope though, that for the best interest of the most people, we do have a decentralized future for the trading of financial assets. There is FAR too much room for people to be taken advantage of and corruption when a central entity controls the way we use and trade money.

So yeah I was aware of this to a degree. I don't think the whales and pumpers, for lack of a better way to describe them, are necessary to keep that volatility you speak of. It may decrease by a decent margin but personally, as a long holder, I don't rely on these short-term swings to make anything. My bet is with what these coins future values will be. I think it would bounce around quite a bit regardless anyway. Also, I think with less volatility you could see more people dabbling or adopting crypto and in turn prices rising. I think some regulations regarding this would help to soften people up the trying this stuff. More people= more investors= more money for all. That is if you invested early and if you're here right now, you have.

Well that's subjective ain't it... Bitcoin serves a singular purpose as a currency and provides no value as a utility. It's simply a means to transfer value and it'snot even the fastes one at it. As a currency, yes you may be correct but it's not  platform for app creation, it's not a anonymous coin, it's not solving voter fraud and there are tons of holes to be filled and right now many coins have to die to be fill those wholes well.

People like bill gates are more invested in cryptos than you are. 
Some, like Warren Buffett for example, are perhaps too old to understand. When asked about it he said it was stupid but he also said he doesn't invest in things he doesn't understand.
I see you're new to reddit which could explain that you have yet to learn that posting random opinions on any trading sub is generally not the move and people will eat you alive. Since you're new to reddit maybe you're new to cryptocurrency as well which would explain why you don't understand that they're insanely volatile and their value fluctuates massively in a short period of time. Going from nearly 10,000 to 8,200 isn't too rare.

@_date: 2018-05-24 15:49:17
Nooo! Media manipulation!? It can't be. hahaha but yes I think we're basically on the same page here. There was a CNBC article awhile back and its headline was basically "Young kid uses bitcoin to build drug empire" with other sentences like "bitcoin, long used for shady purposes like drugs and money laundering, was the boy's primary currency." Like first off cold hard cash is less traceable and has forever been the go-to for the drug trade. They were just over-highlighting bitcoins place in all of it when the article should just be "boy made an opiate empire and is a scumbag." This kind of thing is just an example of so many others, unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-05-15 20:53:59
There are so many coins that already have these features and more and are further along on their own roadmap than bitcoin in terms of additions and adaptations to their coin. To say there's only one coin is like saying there should only be one fiat of which there are countless of. Also, so little of the population have even started dabbling in cryptos as a whole. There is nearly unfathomable room for growth for a ton of them. Granted, many will have to die off so we can establish the best, most advanced systems to use for IoT, money transfers, app creation, etc..

@_date: 2018-05-25 19:59:57
Get a wallet. Maybe exodus wallet is a good start for a beginner. Then make a coinbase or Gemini account. Both are exchanges. Geminis super simple and reliable and so is coinbase. Buy bitcoin on the exchange and then send it to your exodus wallet for safe keeping. From your wallet you can send and receive to whoever. If your sending to someone you simply need their wallets address and if they'resending to you they need yours. Easy as your abs. Ideally you should get a hard  wallet which is like a thumb drive where you store your coins on. Ledger nano s is probably the best option with those. This is probably the most simple user friendly way I know of.

Can robinhood be hacked? Absolutely. For personal information and surely the "bitcoin" that they claim to house. 
In terms of safely investing, storing, and actually owning bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, you can easily register for an account on coinbase.com, gemini.com or a number of other "reputable" exchanges in the industry. It's VERY important to understand that these exchanges can be hacked the same way robinhood could except that you're not insured so your bitcoin effectively disappears. Important to note here that you never actually own the bitcoin you buy in robinhood because you cant take if off of their platform and place it  in your own wallet. The exchanges mentioned above are safe places to exchange your dollars for bitcoin etc. Its just important to not let your bitcoin sit on said exchange for an extended period.
It's worth it to use these other exchanges because you can actually own your bitcoin and do with it as you please. Trade for other currencies, buy things, etc. It is essential, though, that you remove your bitcoin from these exchanges after you've purchased them. You can create a number of wallets to store them on you're computer, but that is really no safer than it sitting on an exchange in regard to hacks because they care connected to the internet and your computer is subject to hack. The safest place for storage is offline in a cold wallet. One of the wallets that crypto holders prefer to use is the ledger nano s. 
I HEAVILY suggest that you watch some youtube videos on safe ways to store crypto before you do anything. Start learning and reading up.
Hope that helps.

It has value regardless of it being used as a currency or not the same way gold does. Gold holds value because of its rarity. Bitcoin is inherently valuable because of it's set quantity. Why now make a cryptocurrency that can handle the massive amount of transactions that the globe needs to operate and have it strictly backed by bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-10-17 17:25:59
Valid question. For the purpose of this I'd use U.S. bonds. Also, for this I would use all the stocks listed in spx, nasdaq, and djia. If I could somehow track everything on a list along with the top 100 cryptos by market cap it would be awesome.
@_date: 2019-06-12 18:08:57
I personally think people are looking at bitcoin entirely wrong. Bitcoin can never support the amount of transactions that the globe needs. Bitcoin is the new gold and we should have a cryptocurrency that is solely backed by bitcoin that can handle massive amounts of transactions.
But that's just my opinion.

Get a hardware wallet and teach whoever you would like to be the beneficiary the pass-codes and key. Keep it in a safe somewhere that they also know the codes for. Of course, this person must also be very very trustworthy. This way, when you die, they already have the access they need.

@_date: 2019-05-31 15:15:14
The bitcoin that you "invested" in lives strictly on Robinhood. With cryptocurrency, you dont own anything unless you have the key to the wallet that it is stored on. Essentially, robinhood is allowing you to "buy" bitcoin and store it with them but you do not literally own anything. If robinhood were to be hacked (brokers and exchanges are hacked all the time) then "your" bitcoin would be gone. If you would like to truly own bitcoin you must buy it from an exchange that allows you to withdraw to your own cryptocurrency wallet. Only then will you truly own bitcoin. 
Robinhood bitcoin or crypto investments are akin to investing in forex with traditional forex brokers. You dont actually own any of the currencies. You can't go withdraw euros from an atm with euros you bought via a broker.
