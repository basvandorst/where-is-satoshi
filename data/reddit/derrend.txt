Your account probably isn't being logged into, I trade on btc-e and I get those emails sometimes but they're always fake.
Even if your account was compromised the attacker wouldn't be able to withdraw any BTC unless they also had the password to your email account and so could click on the withdrawal confirmation link when it arrived.
Also use keepass -

Definitely insider trading happens, first from the exchanges directly, then the devs close to the project and finally the executives at news outlets (coindesk) and their staff. It would be naive to think otherwise imo.

3 hours is not a reasonable length for a show, I like to keep up with bitcoin as much as the next guy but I have a life too.
I would like to listen but I don't have time and that's a failure on the the part of the shows producers imo.

Being able to easily deploy private blockchains has many uses, personally I have been performing double spend attacks, It's based on bitcoin because it seemed like the one people would want and expect. Litecoin will likely be the next candidate.

Because it also deals with BTC, the idea that companies that do not deal exclusively in Bitcoin cannot be discussed is not sensible.

I ordered four Jalapeños in April 2013 with the understanding they would be with me in 12 weeks, those fuckers delivered four paperweights almost a year later and refused to refund me. I'm not saying I want them to get leukaemia but if it has to be someone well.....
And I bought them through paypal but because my 90 days were up when I complained they wouldn't help me either even though they had dozens of complaints from people just like me, their American branch refunded people in the same situation but the European branch gave it's customers the finger (I was in the UK)  so FUCK YOU TOO PAYPAL.

Can you imagine the community uproar if blockchain.info or any of the bitcoin exchanges pulled this stunt.
You've just got to wonder who these idiots at the top are who think it's a valuable use of time and resources to do shit like this. Also the pin they sent me is one I set myself using an ATM after first receiving my card too.
@_date: 2014-10-12 05:32:49
Why not simply follow the coins already assigned to that address (which you must already have), why waste a satoshi and let the owner know you're surveying them?
@_date: 2014-08-06 05:44:50
This situation has always confused me, so it goes like this:
Customer vs DigitalOcean
DO - "For x price you can have x amount of resources on our servers for x amount of time.
CU - "Fantastic, I would like to use 100% of my resources 100% of the time please"
DO - "Oh no, you cant do that. It's against our TOS"

@_date: 2014-05-08 06:52:56
The only people who call coinjar an exchange are people who have never used it, here are no graph, you cannot place buy or sell orders either, you can just 'buy/sell them' on the spot for what ever the price is at that moment which you also don't know until you click the quote button. It's a shop let's at least make that clear. Australia does not have a real bitcoin exchange yet.

@_date: 2015-05-15 22:30:58
You can verify the source as often as you like but if your item is perishable and fresh out of the packet then you might be sceptical if it has been scanned before, if it was something like a second hand fashion accessory then you might allow for half a dozen scans before becoming sceptical, or if the number of scans rises and you are not the party responsible.

The risk is rationally acceptable imo.
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:24:52
iirc it was because the devs decided to implement a new algo into an alternate project (frycoin) before their own because they were greedy and destroyed community confidence. Try reading the bitcointalk thread rather than just linking to it ;)

When the bus is crowded I take the train, if the train is crowded I take a taxi. It's not avoidance it's choice and when there is a cheaper alternative that achieves the same result which I feel confident in using (litecoin, monero, ...) I use them like any other rational person would.

I believe LTC to BTC conversion fee is 0.0006% on btc-e.  
It costs 0.0006 BTC ($0.72) to convert 100 LTC into BTC.

I agree it's an unfortunate situation. Some people won't have a problem with it and that's fine. I suppose I'm a bit fanatical at the moment, maybe it will wear off with time and my confidence will grow back :)
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:24:49
LTC's liquidity is unquestionable, more than $2,545,650 have been traded in the past 24 hours alone.
Spreads and slippage work both ways so you also stand to make a profit but neither of them are relevant to transaction fees imo.
A blockchain's value comes from its immutability. ETH is not immutable, it lost it's integrity when it reversed a bunch of transactions at the behest of a 3rd party application provider who lost investor capital due to incompetence as I understand it.
Do you think ETH would say no to a government who ordered them to reverse your transactions or do you trust they would not do that from their behaviour (presidents set) in the past?
@_date: 2017-03-01 10:27:22
@_date: 2017-03-01 06:43:01
Tradeoffs and advantages. I agree.
@_date: 2017-03-01 04:05:40
Depends on the size of your transaction I suppose but my point is that the fees on the alternate networks (LTC in this case) are substantially cheaper than the BTC network.
@_date: 2017-03-01 06:41:35
I'm not saying any of those things, simply that the fee I paid for my LTC transaction was over 99% cheaper.
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:39:51
I appreciate your analysis very much and thank you for taking the time to post that information.  
You raise many interesting points there.  
It is a conundrum. Hopefully someone as smart as Satoshi might come along one day and come up with an innovative solution to this problem :)  
You raise some good points regarding double spend attacks too, having to the confirmation limit would be a shame, a 10 minute wait is already long enough imo but you've definitely given me a few things to think about :)

I just woke up to find 8 games have been played on bit-chikun since I posted on reddit last night!  
My many thanks to those brave enough to give it a try. I wrote the first draft of this code over a year ago and it's feels very satisfying to finally see it doing some work :)  
My heart felt thanks and appreciation to the great community on redit! :D
@_date: 2016-06-06 13:12:18
aka, you want to see the source code.  
Humm. All the transactions are published and charted for all to see on the results page but would I be satisfied with that... dunno, probably not if I was in 100% alert mode.  
Wait for the source code would be my advice if you feel that way but I would say "Have you ever reviewed the source for satoshi dice?"  
I bet few people have but they still play it.  
Don't trust me. I'm a bitcoiner so my philosophy is **trust nobody**.  
The code base is quite small but it's a django project and the private key is in plain text in the views.py file (for payment processing purposes), give me a few days to abstract it and I'll happily publish the code :)
@_date: 2016-06-08 01:14:12
Well spotted, I will fix it as soon as I get the chance, thanks :)
@_date: 2016-06-07 04:56:03
I understand completely and I 100% see where you're coming from, I wasn't trying to sound frustrated in that last post at all, I was just trying to throw as many bullet points into as small a space as possible :)  
Your point of view is absolutely correct, you should never trust anyone now that provably trustless systems exist. If someone suggests you trust them when it is not necessary then you should definitely be on high alert.  
I do think though your point that it seems this game cannot be proven to be fair beyond reasonable doubt has been made, and I acknowledge it.  
Thank you.
@_date: 2016-06-11 06:36:08
Because we would move to the litecoin and they would have to buy them all over again, or so the theory goes.
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:28:33
Cannot argue with that. Good advice is good advice :)  
Apparently P2P messaging may be added to the btc protocol in the near future. If that is the case then perhaps the participants will be able to contact each other and verify that the winning addresses are not controlled by the admin?  
Still early days I suppose.  
EDIT: I just looked on the bitcoin bip page but couldn't find the proposal, perhaps I was mistaken.
@_date: 2016-06-06 23:30:06
Ah yes, I must have stripped it out when I revamped the site a few months ago. It was only the registration cert from UKCS.  
I'll remove it from the announcement page on bitcointalk.

@_date: 2016-06-06 21:45:58
Understood and I can appreciate where you are coming from. An interesting experiment though I think. There have been 8 results so far and some have been quite close together. I'm guessing that may have been someone betting against themselves to test the water perhaps.

The game of course, not bitcoin :p  
For full details you should take a look at the 'about' page but I was hoping that if the game became popular enough there could emerge an ecosystem in which wealthier players are outnumbered by less wealthy players making smaller bets and so act like predators and prey.  
Sometimes though wealthy players would be matched with each other and so goes the power struggle.  
All feedback appreciated :)  
...  
**WE WANT TO SEE THE SOURCE CODE!**  
You (and me) are the bitcoin community and yes of course you want to see the source code so you know I'm not secretly trying to rape you on the back end.  
I'm working quite intensely on  which is my latest startup so give me a chance to review the chikun code, strip out the private keys and modify the page to page access codes, I'll post an announcement as soon as it's up on github.  
Would be nice to have some beta testers in the meantime though if you're not feeling too paranoid.  
I've got my tinfoil hat on ;)  
...  
**EDIT: Source code now available on github:**  
  
...  
I was also thinking about organising a kickstarter campaign and offering 10% of the business to donors in the form of dividend paying shares issued on counterparty or some other similar platform. Would that be interesting to anyone?  
I only ask because I was considering doing the same thing with cryptoproof.info in an effort to raise funds for code review and security auditing.  
Still undecided on this point though.  
Once again, all feedback appreciated :)

Nothing reflex about it, he's 100% correct. If fraud occurred (rogue employee at the token factory) and there was more than one token in existence with the same private key how would you ever know it?  
Successfully decoding messages can be done by anyone who holds a copy of the private key, Being able to tell if there is more than one private key in the wild is THE HOLY GRAIL of this industry.

Well I suppose all I can say to that is if it was ever discovered that I had been abusing the site then my career in IT and IT security would be over. My other projects such as  would be ruined, I would be convicted of a criminal offence because everyone knows who I am on linkedin, stackoverflow, redit, tradingview, bitcointalk etc, the work I have done for the Queensland police department (which was bitcoin related) would be brought into question and potentially criminal cases would have to be re-examined  I would be deported form Australia (because I'm  a British citizen on a migratory visa) and my new found fame as a bitcoin scammer would render me impotent in this incredibly fertile and tightly knit space which I love working in forever.  
So from a risk/reward game theory point of view I'd have to be downright pathological to go to those lengths and risk all that for 0.00472537 BTC or $2.79 USD -   
We live in the real world and to be honest I'm just too damn lazy for any of that garbage ;)

Nothing plausible about that. If I'm a cop and I come to your house I know that the person who ordered the package knows your address and the name of the person who used to live there. Since the only beneficiary in this situation is you because you're in possession of the package and you know both those pieces of information, you would fit my suspect criteria perfectly.
Incorporating details relevant to your life/identity is what f**ks people up in the end. It's the equivalent of signing your work.
@_date: 2016-09-01 00:57:18
Send it to your house but use a different name and don't open the package for 24-48 hours.
That way if the cops land on you, you can simply claim that you assumed someone had sent the package to your address by mistake and your intention was to return it to the post office at your earliest opportunity.

database available for public audit :)
@_date: 2016-05-18 06:40:33
In a nutshell we log subkey addresses of the submitted extended public keys to a desired level. Users can then submit these addresses to the website and discover who it is associated with.
We keep count of the number of times the address is submitted so you can know if there is more than one copy in the wild.
We give an example in which we create verifiable photo ID in the about section of the website.
I should also mention it is the sha256 hash of the address that is stored in the database and so no use to hackers. The extended public key is never written to disk.
We don't log hits into the blockchain, so no bloat.
No trust required. A live snapshot of the database is available any time from '

In this case what we mean by 'pollution' is 'you shouldn't Impact the blockchain unless absolutely necessary'. :)
It's good that the OP_RETURN data can be pruned but your node still had to download and verify it.
If a company can function in such a way that it does not impact the blockchain then in our opinion they have a social (and business) responsibility to do so.

@_date: 2015-10-12 06:11:27
Let me first of all say that you are the first person in the last six months to give me some real feedback regarding this tech and I cannot express my thanks enough.
I do suspect, as you mention, that much of the audience so far has misunderstood the project, some of the questions I receive on bitcointalk are not relevant to the sites functionality. I hope to continue to improve how it is presented but my main focus at this early stage is making the site work and everything else has mostly taken a back seat thus far.
The kickstarter video for instance really is a tutorial and not a business pitch.
-Who is my target market?
In my opinion this technology has most potential regarding 3D printed products in whichever form they may take. A realistic solution to detecting cloned products which 3D printers will be able to recreate perfectly has not yet been proposed to my knowledge and it was this point which was forefront in my mind when I began developing the system.
-When will you start making enough money to pay back the 30,000GBP?
To be quite honest I wasn't planning to pay back anything. I was hoping for the crowd to realise the potential benefit to society as a whole and donate.
-Is Bitcoin widely used enough for this to be an effective anti-counterfeiting tool?
I would say yes to this because the fact that the subkeys, or rather 'sub-serial numbers' are also valid addresses on the BTC network is irrelevant if all you are interested in is product origin or counterfeit detection.
As more BTC services appear then the more relevant BTC becomes and so the Bitcoin aspect will hopefully become a self fulfilling prophecy over time.
-How will you grow beyond the initial target market to start serving companies who maybe aren't sold on the whole Bitcoin thing?
Getting people to listen in the first place in order to explain what benefits the site offers is the hardest part, for this I need publicity and for publicity I need funding. I have consolidated all the relevant software on the user side into docker containers with copy and paste commands and a video tutorial for simplicity but still a learning curve remains. I am working on the android app right now and will continue to think of new ways to make cryptoproof more comprehensible to the lay person as development continues. As for the Bitcoin aspect I would again mention that the word 'subkey' is interchangeable with 'sub-serial number' and so any company not sold on Bitcoin would still be free to use the service and simply ignore the cryptocurrency aspect if they so wished.
Please don't hesitate to contact me with any more feedback/questions/suggestions you may have. I am definitely still learning as I go with this :)
Thanks again.

onename and world-citizenship store data inside of the btc blockchain because they consider it to be a security feature.  
cryptoproof does not store data in the btc blockchain because we consider it to be pollution.
Pros and cons??
@_date: 2016-05-22 22:31:24
cryptoproof was designed from the ground up to be trustless, users control 100% of their data. We would be happy to contribute in any way we can.

That will be because no extended master public key that produces any of those addresses has been submitted to the website.
The database will only contain addresses belonging to users who have registered with a empk. It is through this method that we associate identities with bitcoin addresses.

Thanks for the 3D printing leads I'll get straight on to them as soon as the android app is functional and more visually appealing.
Haven't really looked into the state of that sector until now, propositions such as quantum dots and imperfect crystals embedded in things seems a bit overblown in my opinion and I haven't seen another cryptographic solution yet which is reassuring, especially one involving a blockchain.
I very much appreciate the encouragement and offer of help, you sound very clued up regarding this space and I'm quite sure I don't have if all figured out just yet :)

The code will be opensourced once we exit beta. The technical answer to your question for now though is no.
It would not be in our interest or make sense for us to be dishonest, we can perform the same service without behaving fraudulently so it would be logical for us to do so.
The site is designed from the ground up to require no personal information, there are no email addresses or passwords. Our policy is to operate as if we expect to be hacked and so we make the information stored within the database useless on purpose and publish it.
We started to opensource some of the sites tools already on github '

And now I'm in suspense... ;)
@_date: 2016-05-18 08:40:25
Only if you opt in and only if you give them the subkey address :)
They cannot get that from us because we do not store it in plain text.
The idea is to use the addresses as single purpose barcodes for various purposed which can be cryptographically associated with an origin.
@_date: 2016-05-20 02:24:33
It seems to me that the qr code must be imprinted or embedded onto the item it corresponds with, as a certificate of authenticity it would be useless but there may be cases in which you do not want the address to be exposed and so it would have to be discreet in some way.
EDIT: Unless it was intended to become useless after the first scan. Medication for example could have a code on the bottle and not the individual pills.

Private blockchains are not worthless, competing entities such as insurance companies who wish to share data in a trustless way without involving the public would find them very useful.
Families of the future may wish to mine their own blockchians at home and issue the tokens to their kids which they could redeem for treats from the crypto-fridge to limit their sugar intake. The list of use cases is literally endless.
Private blockchains are extremely valuable, you would be naive to think otherwise.

Untrue. You just need it to be a lottery and there are many ways to do that. You could set up a network limited to (lets say) a dozen nodes and augment the source code to pick one at random at what ever interval you desire. This is possible because you know the size of the network in advance, minimal computer power required.
