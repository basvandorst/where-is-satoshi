I did, but I'm afraid they won't reply (I looked that up on Google and there are way too many cases). I know my coins are safe, I just have no idea what's going on with the Secondary Password and don't want to get them locked in there.

The problem is that I had 2 imported addresses there. That phrase doesn't recover them too, does it?

A 0.00025BTC fee (the one I chose for the transaction I linked in the OP) means less than 2sats/byte.. I didn't know this would happen if I receive a lot of micropayments!

What do you mean? Is "change address" the one Blockchain mobile app automatically creates for new transactions? I'm just afraid my money is gone .. the mobile &amp; the website are showing two different things.

Thanks for explaining. I knew these addresses existed, but I thought only the sums I type in are going to be sent (for example, if I wanted to send 0.05BTC, that sum is sent to a Change address and then to the destination address, not more) and this is why I got a little bit worried about it.

I've been using Blockchain since 2013 and I had no issues until they changed the user interface last year or two years ago.. it worked perfectly until then. After the "update" my secondary password wasn't recognized anymore (and I wrote it down on a paper when I set it, and I have even the mnemonic for it), and it is annoying to get a new address every time I want to receive BTC.. I guess (and hope) this is what happened and my money is still in my account..

I don't think I need a Trezor. My country has just under 10 places I can pay with BTC at. I was trying to find a way to store my funds somewhere, and I find paper wallets the most convenient for me as I just want to keep it at home safe.

Thank you, sir! Best regards.

I think (and hope) I have eliminated the risks as soon as I have created a bootable Live Linux CD that removes every change when being powered off. After I have created the wallet, do I have to send coins before printing it out or it doesn't matter at all? And can it be imported into any wallet I want later?

In the second question I was asking how can I get my paper wallet funds back into a Blockchain wallet, for example, whenever I need it. As soon as I'm using the paper wallet does it become unusable or? I don't really understand how can I exactly use it.

What do you mean? I have just tested this by printing out a paper wallet and adding $0.2 to it. As soon as I have imported it into my Blockchain wallet, I am starting to see the transactions. So now I should simply transfer all I have from that paper wallet to my main wallet and then throw the paper away &amp; create a new one? It's the only thing I don't understand at this moment: why all the balance and not just part of it? 
@_date: 2016-09-12 06:37:31
I see, thank you for the reply!

Do you think there's a problem if I'm going to print it in black &amp; white? I don't have color right now on my printer. Sorry for so many questions, I'm just a little bit scared as a noob with these paper wallets :D
@_date: 2016-09-13 09:41:12
I'm trying to transfer 0.01, not 0.016. I don't think the transaction fee is 0.006, it doesn't even make sense. 
@_date: 2016-09-12 06:25:50
I'm looking for a way through which I can store BTC safely to later be able to use the funds with any wallet, not just Electrum.

We always have regrets during these violent cycles: "I could've bought cheaper", "I could've sold earlier", etc.
We really cannot accurately predict crashes/booms every time as unexpected things almost always happen. What we, crypto enthusiasts &amp; "veterans", know is that it will not be the **end** of Bitcoin or cryptocurrency, it's still in its infancy BUT we have seen an unbelieveable rise of market caps, prices, total amount of crypto investors and a rise of the number of existing cryptocurrencies like never before.
I think it's naive to say cryptocurrencies will never go down. Any market has its falls and rises, but it's almost impossible to have an investment that will get you profits forever.
I don't want to convince anyone to sell, buy or hold, but I'm sharing my thoughts on this so-called "crash". I will keep holding and buying although my total portofolio is 8x smaller than just 3 months ago. Look at all this immense projection of prices and the extremely rapid growth &amp; adoption of cryptocurrencies. This is a different kind of bubble than those of real estate, fiat &amp; other industries.
EDIT: Take my message only as a personal opinion of mine. I've been through most BTC cycles and I took most of the wrong decisions during price plunges or extremely high rises. So I would rather not take any action and leave my portofolio untouched until it's over.
I wanted to say nice comment, but I forgot, haha!

Does the paper wallet become unusable after it's being imported? 
@_date: 2016-09-13 10:31:38
I understand. Which wallet would you recommend me then? Coinbase? 
@_date: 2016-09-12 06:29:48
Oh, I see. So it's just a paper wallet to which I can send funds anytime that I can import to any software/browser wallet whenever I want to. Thanks for the reply.
