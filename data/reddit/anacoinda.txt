Thanks! Yes that's where Python comes in handy. I have been thinking about other aggregations such as  "former Soviet Union" or "bottom 80% currencies" but not sure how much value that would add.

Thanks for your kind words :)
I personally prefer transactions, especially for poorer countries which I think are more positively impacted by Bitcoin. In short, more transactions = more users.
However, it should be relatively easy to add a few buttons to the tables to allow you to sort on tx and USD volume.
Weekly instead of daily - I'm going to take it into account!

Thanks friend!
I think there is a reset button in the plot windows (look for the looped arrows). Please let me know if that solves your problem. 
To be honest I'm not sure if zooming is such a great feature in this case, I might disable it altogether.
The y axis formatting is a well known issue, thanks for reminding me - it should be easy to fix.

Why wait until Sunday when you can see CNY volumes [every day]( :)
I have daily LocalBitcoins volumes in USD for over 80 currencies and 9 aggregates.
Please let me know if you have any feedback!

You can zoom the axes individually by using the scroll wheel when hovering your cursor over the respective axes.
But yeah the box zoom thing is not very useful :)
Thanks again for your input!

Shameless plug of my Venezuela chart which has USD value by default: 
(check out the other currencies too!)
@_date: 2017-02-07 11:37:11
Shameless plug:  shows you a rolling 7-day average ($60k per day as we speak)

Of course this has knock-on effects for Latin America, which is now doing $140k, 700tx daily:

Exactly - it's really fun to watch countries like Morocco (MAD) or Tanzania (TZS) just "waking up" out of nowhere.
Because trading on LBC comes with a high fee, people will only buy from it to hold - not for daytrading. So these are "real" trades. And seeing LBC volumes going up exponentially makes me think that's the most bullish signal you can get - real people from countries around the world in it for the long haul. (Except maybe in Nigeria where there's a pyramid scheme going on involving Bitcoin :/)
There's 14000 tx worldwide per day on LBC which is around 5% of all Bitcoin transactions, another sign it's a big deal.

Via LocalBitcoins, around $20k per day at the moment, and rising fast.

Hi, thanks for your comment!
Yes, full currency name is something I should add - I know myself what RSD stands for but the average user probably doesn't know it's Serbian Dinar :)
Growth is another great suggestion, I'll probably end up adding a growth percentage in the aggregate table that you can sort on.

Would [USD]( be OK as well?

Most currencies on LBC show a drop in the weekend (last 2 days). Nevertheless, for CNY, the past 7 days have been bigger in terms of USD than the week before that if you add up those numbers.
You can get the data on a transaction level via LocalBitcoins' API: see here for more info: [

Note that this is the 7-day rolling average.

Don't forget:
* Ukraine (UAH): 
* Pakistan (PKR): 
* New Zealand (NZD): 
* Tanzania (TZS): 
* Middle East: 
EDIT: 
* Last but not least, Nigeria going ballistic:

You're welcome!

VEF volume going up, up, up even in USD terms (over $60k daily as we speak, and that's the 7-day average)
