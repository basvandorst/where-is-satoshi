You can open up a brokerage account with most banks.  This will let you trade stocks and bonds.  In order to actually exact the trades most banks have an app that lets you do all your investing through your phone.  If you are afraid of banks like many in this sub are then you could look for a firm which strictly acts as a broker.  If you are in the USA I would recommend Robinhood because there are 0 transaction fees \(although they charge interest on money in your account which you have not invested\).  Overall, the key difference between stocks and bonds is that bonds are safer than stocks due to greater protection for holders of debt than there are for equity holders.
If you want something to start off on, then I would recommend investing in index funds \(particularly those that match the S&amp;P 500\) as they are a low risk way to ease yourself into investing.
Finally, you may hear people talking about options.  Don't touch options until you thoroughly understand what they are and the risks associated with them.

Because you can pay taxes with it?...

In the same way that telling someone to go to the doctor is an appeal to authority.    Appeal to authority isn't trusting an economist about economics because they are an economist, Appeal to authority is trusting an economist about things OTHER than economics because the are an economist.


That's true.  But I'd be willing to put a bet that the percapita density of economists on this subreddit mostly dominated by economically illiterate teenage libertarians and ancaps is less than that of economists in the general population.

Your comment is so generically lolbertarian it is hilarious.  The Austrian school is trash. End of story.  What pushed the US out of the recession in 2008? Keynesian Bailout.

I'm sorry but who are you? You talk like you're some big shot on this sub but I've never even seen you before.  Beyond that, your analysis is bunk.

Looking at his post history I am inclined to agree with you.  Smh this guy is so typical reddit it's almost comical, conservative "libertarian" misogynist MRA that has an infatuation with bitcoin and hates the federal reserve.  If I had to pick one person to represent reddit in a concentrated exaggerated way it would be this guy.
