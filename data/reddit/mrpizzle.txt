if you still happen to have your the confirmation email that Mt.Gox sends you when you first open your account, your UUID is it the confirmation link.

I'm getting the idea that she's purposely keeping the pressure on in hopes that the real SN comes out and settles the debate once and for all.
Too bad Leah your career won't last until then lol
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:42:17
Works fine here as well.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:54:00
You're asking us to allow a "1%" type situation with Bitcoin, the very same ideal that originally caused the financial crisis and one of the many reasons why bitcoin was created to begin with?  No thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:38:05
Doesn't anybody else see this as a potential flash-mass-murder-for-bitcoin waiting to happen?  This is real money you guys are talking about here.  
Say someone accumulates about 2 Bitcoins worth of "game money" (using the 0.1 as base like in the video) and then someone attacks you in-game.  You lose your 2 BTC and now have to scourge around to picking your dropped coins, meanwhile, asshole besides you is doing the same thing, but only picking up your coins in return.  Coins you spent time finding and picking up.  
There's some serious potential for violence here.
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:45:30
No problem :D 
What audience are you aiming for, casual enthusiasts or general public? 
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:19:27
Nope, never ever. The odds are orders of magnitude larger than your powerball example. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:07:16
I don't get why this is necessary with the onset of multisig wallets.
Would someone care to chime in?
@_date: 2014-03-17 19:18:05
If that's the case then Desjardins offers something of the like but it's only for a certain function.  Nothing for online banking.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:43:25
It should be noted that your UUID can also be found in password reactivation emails from Gox
Edit: Also only accounts that had/have (ha!) a balance (BTC, US, etc) are listed. If you always had a 0 BTC / 0 USD balance you're not listed here.
Edit 2: Reason why I believe accounts with any kind of balance are the only ones listed, here's sql code that dumped the table, notice the **!=0** *"mysql&gt; SELECT * FROM platform.User_Wallet WHERE platform.User_Wallet.Balance != 0 ORDER BY platform.User_Wallet.Balance DESC;"*
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:24:56
Better to be safe, even if it isn't.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:34:48
These guys also funded Ripple :/
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:46:41
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:18:54
Also I should mention for those who have aren't exactly sure of their balance or date of transactions, if you still happen to have your the confirmation email that Mt.Gox sends you when you first open your account, your UUID is it the confirmation link.
It matches up in my case, happing analysing!
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:12:40
Doge did it not long ago so technically possible but would require a good fork.  Now whether people would still use it if it comes to that is another story.
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:38:38
I'm liking this idea, kudos guys
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:52:00
I'm amazed he thinks he'll find sanctum in Canada.  
@_date: 2014-03-19 16:50:31
I'm convinced that they're baiting the general population to save the business.  I mean, what else do you have to lose on a sinking ship besides your morals?
@_date: 2014-04-04 00:35:36
Thanks for this
@_date: 2014-03-10 00:07:42
This online search doesn't seem forgiving for wildcards, so looks like you have to be exact in your UUID.  If you grab the excel version you can do a partial search for a better chance of finding what you're looking for.  Also from what I've noticed is that the list only contains accounts with balances, so if you never had a balance, you're not listed.
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:29:47
I wouldn't call her a liar, just misguided in thinking she had the real deal without any significant proof.
Shady as fuck as how she went to report it tho, nothing solid at all but hey, let's post it anyways!
She got duped by an old guy who wanted a free lunch.  They both got screwed here.
Edit: typo
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:12:33
The April date is more of a public dismissal of support for the general populace.  On the enterprise side of things they're still supporting XP for some of the bigger corporations that haven't completed migration yet for a bit longer.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:52:07
He called a satoshi a hitachi lol

So is Desjardins

Sounds like the guy who's trying to spam every once and an while.  
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:32:33
Thank you

Any time there's an elected board there's corruption that looms around the corner, regardless of ideal and goals.  There's always preferential treatment and gains towards the "right" people.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:49:47
I think you may mean trading fee, it's 0.2% per trade.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:30:59
Is part of your bank's app or a stand-alone app similar to Google Authenticator?
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:59:35
Don't forget, if you're going to download something unknown of this caliber, it's best to use Tor and a VM to download and view.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:21:18
sipak, please check my comments for info on how to find your UUID! :)
@_date: 2014-04-06 23:30:48
I second this question.
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:13:09
If you do a fixed width split in the Stamp column, Excel's filter will do a much better job at separating dates.   
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:40:20
It really works if you want something minimalist and I see your point.  
If I may make a slight suggestion, perhaps add the option of having some  indicators made available?
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:30:08
Oh snap, 344
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:22:59
It's not that all surprising really, most of the DVR's run a linux kernel as a base and go from there.  Security's not exactly on the top end here either.
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:31:57
Have to agree here about it not being that funny, otherwise the art is nicely done.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:02:39
Password recovery emails I just noticed also contain the UUID in the confirmation link, hopefully this could help!
I have a habit of keeping my emails :D
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:03:33
I'm glad you you elaborated on this in more detail. 
Points 1, 2 and 3 I have no problems with.
Point 4: I don't have a problem with this assuming the game isn't "always on", if it is then I can see this as having a virtual roadblock put up on your daily commute for example.
Point 5: I guess it wouldn't really, but due diligence is needed on both parties.  Like Consumer A who's trying to rip out Consumer B's eyes while Store A is turning a blind eye. (Ha!)
@_date: 2014-03-17 14:27:23
It's nice and simple, but what would be the advantage of using this compared to bitcoinwisdom.com?
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:28:51
347 :)
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:23:35
Also I'd imagine that if such a fork were to happen, a rebranding would be required or turned into a new coin completely to avoid tarnishing the original ideology of Bitcoin altogether. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:20:32
Oh it got publicly leaked alright.
@_date: 2014-03-08 04:28:37
She doesn't understand the idea that someone who's holding a gun to you and your family's heads can walk away with a paper wallet worth billions.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:39:21
True.  But we didn't factor in 2FA, I'm hoping that it's the final wall but at this point who knows.
I'm guessing that the first thing that Gox does, if ever it comes back online, is to completely reset passwords for every one.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:51:25
Her twitter has been awfully quiet today
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:28:59
The user/account mapping wasn't exactly like how it's setup on the gox website but people that knew how to find their UUID were able to verify their balances.  
Both my balances from the leak and from the website match up.
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:59:20
Just mention Doge in the trollbox and you'll have at least two mods knocking at your door lol
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:23:37
Seems like they're based in Toronto as well.  Time to take a visit?
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:25:58
I'm getting API errors left and right... 
Edit: Missing user error on top of that
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:49:23
And even then, the mining difficulty is so high up there that you can't do diddly squat with consumer hardware.  Like he says, it's best to buy in at a good price and go from there.  Otherwise you're wearing down your Mac for absolutely no gains.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:24:21
Not here in Canada.  Both TD Bank and Desjardins neither use 2FA.  
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:18:27
It's a reference to the current trade fee, not for using the api.  If ever the trade fee changes, this is the variable for it.
@_date: 2014-03-23 13:29:02
I'm guessing if anywhere, he'd be in the BC area.
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:36:12
True, good point.  Mindbogglingly improbable I'd say.
@_date: 2014-03-16 19:27:19
Cold storage perhaps?
