It's not about licensing phones, it's about licensing software. All software is licensed, unless you're purchasing the source code, IP, and often patents, outright. However, I don't think customers want to pay for a billion dollar piece of software. So, as with pretty much all commercial software for consumers, it's licensed for their use.
If you want take apart a physical iPhone, or smash it, go for it. It's yours. But, the software (including boot loader, rom, firmware, drivers,  OS, etc) are all licensed software and are subject to the terms of use accompanying them. Don't like the terms? Don't use the software. But, good luck trying to get a piece of raw hardware with zero code on it to do something. It wouldn't even be capable of attempting to boot because it wouldn't have firmware.

Take a look at the other exchanges in realtime as well. It isn't *that* far off. Certainly not below $500 USD. (At the time of posting)

Entirely possible, and even likely. But, if all exchanges are staying around MTGox...and MTGox is staying above OP's 'below $500 and we don't know'....doesn't that make the fair market value *everywhere* at MTGox's advertised price? Which would invalidate his point of $500 being the current market price?
It's possible I'm entirely wrong on this...but the above makes sense to me?

How about not pimping out your site where it isn't warranted or wanted?

An average is useless for comparing exchanges.
No where on that page does it mention the names of any exchanges you used to compute it.
The word average appears 3 times on your page. None of them reference that computed number.
It doesn't document its time scale for updates or delay.
Not going to debate the semantics or usefulness of the information included in all of the write-up as I'm sure at least some of it is useful for beginners. But, definitely going to argue that your real-time ticker of exchanges has no source listed on that page, no method of calculation named, and no list of exchanges included in the calculation.
Without any of those things, and without an individual breakdown of exchanges its fairly useless for analyzing trends or comparing exchanges in any meaningful way.
Right now an exchange could be at $500, and the rest at $750 and you will have produced a completely ridiculous number that was relevant to no exchange in the real world...with no way of finding out why or what calculations were involved in that number.
Edit: Just found the rollover on the coin image that tells that its an average. Consider putting that somewhere NOT hidden. Still missing exchange information, however, and that is key.

This site seems to be drastically lacking in useful information in comparison to the one I posted. What was your point? I provided legitimate evidence to the contrary of OP's post with tons of useful information and charts of the exchanges in question....You provided an aggregate price of exchanges with no breakdown or comparisons, and a site explaining the concept of Bitcoin. Plus, it seems to be just posting a link to your own site.
I'm fully aware of the goings on in Bitcoin, and the sheer number of exchanges. However, the timeline and graph of the top 4 exchanges (that I provided) is plenty of evidence to the contrary of the OP and is undeserving of your rather insulting "do your homework" comment.

Thought so... Just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing something!

I did. 4 of them. You provided none of this. No sourced or validated data on your site, no breakdown, etc. Nothing useful. Not even a named exchange.
By avoiding your page and going to actual exchange comparisons, I'm practicing what I preach. I prefer data that's actually useful.
