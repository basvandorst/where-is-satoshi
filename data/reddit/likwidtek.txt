What's with the clickbait title?
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:38:45
Forgive me if I'm crazy here, but where the part about "Including via Windows update?"  
@_date: 2012-12-21 13:59:30
Thank you I'll give it a shot. 
@_date: 2012-12-20 23:24:06
Hmm, looks like this feature is under developement and will be released with 0.8.0  
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:25:24
Yes. That's exactly the point. Investing IS gambling. That's entire fucking point. You risk therefore you are rewarded. 
You think investing is some magical process where you are just given free money? You're making a gamble. Always. Investing. Gambling. Hedging. All the same.

Perhaps you are not a native english speaker but "take risky action in the hope of a desired result." is the actual definition of gamble.  When investing there are all types of risk exposure.  Investing in some type of low risk exposure mutual fund or IRA, while low risk, is still a gamble.  There is still risk.  HIGH risk exposure investments like IPOs, options, venture capital, or honestly any high yield investment is the literal definition of gambling.  
If I'm wrong, I'd love to see your diversified investment portfolio and you can school me on what a novice investor I am.  Educate us all.  But it very honestly sounds like you may simply not understand the definition of the word and are assuming it means "casino games".

Does anyone know a support phone number for these guys?  This is nuts. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:26:26
Also, looking through your history here, ok.  We get it.  You're a girl.  You like bitcoin.  You seem to really enjoy the attention you get from being a girl with an interest in BTC.  Ok, now crush the stereotype and become an expert and put yourself in a position where people look forward to hearing from you because you bring more to the table than "well, I'm a girl".  This is going to sound dickish but if you want that sort of attention, just post sexy pics of you holding computer or gaming equipment in one of the gonewild variants.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:37:58
What are the rates per money hop?  Could you tell me what, in the end, one would pay in fees (total) to convert $1,000 USD to BTC?  Also, what's the turn around time?
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:14:25
Your best bet is to get on  or  
@_date: 2013-07-16 18:38:51
I don't think so, no.  I believe that is only impacting sending BTC *TO* CampBX.  I'm trying to make a withdraw.  
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:17:46
Yup, same issue here.
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:22:40
Would you mind reading and replying to [this accusation by MagicalTux]( stating that you added OTP *AFTER* your account was compromised?  I'd like to hear your side of it.
@_date: 2013-06-18 05:13:33
It sort of looks terrible.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:16:42
Ugh... the beeping.  I'm not trying to be that guy but it really sounds like you're just rambling about something you're not really familiar about.  Also, in what way is this video catered to women?  
I hear a lot of "I believe in it" and "I get to control my money" you know... idea statements but no meat.  Nothing really tangible being said here.
Also, you're saying things like bitcoin is advantageous over USD because there are no fees, no middle men, easy to obtain, and you never have to worry about your money disappearing..   Almost none of that is true.  
Hear me out, Currently if you want to convert $3,000 of your USD savings and exchange it for BTC, you're telling me that you can do this with no fees, quickly and easily, with no middle men?
Currently it's very complicated, time consuming and very expensive to obtain BTC in decent amounts.  Keeping any bitcoin or money in exchanges is also very risky right now.  
Please don't take this reply as just nitpicking, I just don't see how your video "gets women interested" let alone provides a total bitcoin noob any facts or information.
I say don't give up, just research, think about the message you're wanting to give, write down some talking points, and deliver a video with less hyperbole and "I believe" and more meat.  :)  Good luck!

Awesome!  Thank you so much!  Many things are out of stock though.  Although you do have the Nexus 7..  Any idea when the iPads will be back in stock?
@_date: 2013-07-16 18:49:53
Thanks.  I'll post an update as soon as I see a change.  :(
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:20:40
Edited the original post:  "Update - 3 hours later and the transaction finally hit the blockchain. Confirmations came soon after that. My advice, until CampBX gets their servers upgraded/migrated, Don't rely on them for instant or quick transactions. I really want them to succeed but they are just getting crushed with demand. They should have put a cap on the number of users until they upgraded. This is just very poor service. Still, I really really want them to do well."
@_date: 2013-04-20 02:34:22
Yikes.  6% though plus a fee?  Nuts.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:50:36
Hmmm, so I actually attempted to place an order, but they're only valuing my bitcoin at the weighted average price.  Is that common?  Because that's a pretty decent chunk of change less than current value.
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:09:30
So am I reading this right?


OP is caught lying?
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:04:22
This is great, trouble is, finding someone who is "at the ready" with large amounts at all times is sort of tough I guess.  
@_date: 2013-04-19 20:02:53
Mining is in such limbo right now.  With all the delays with the new 5Gh/s equipment out there.... no one is getting into it right now.  It's just not profitable.  
I really do need to network with local bitcoin miners though.  Would be nice.
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:58:01
Not sure.  Can you break the process down and list each company's fee?  Also, how many times have you done this?  People keep complaining about Bitinstant.
@_date: 2013-07-16 19:41:04
Heh, sorry.  Thanks for replying.  To explain, basically I will sell BTC in person, online and other places to help people get access to bitcoin who either can't buy them on an exchange or who want to remain anonymous.  Usually I keep my BTC in my wallet however all of it was stored at CampBX.
If I sell some BTC to someone, meaning, trading them BTC for fiat, they give me USD, and I send them BTC.  I've sent from CampBX before and it shows up on the blockchain instantly.  However you just wait for confirmations like normal.  
Today, when trying to transfer BTC from CampBX to an outside wallet... CampBX would deduct the BTC from my account, and show up in my transaction log however it does not show up on the blockchain whatsoever.
It's just frustrating.  What makes it more frustrating is that if they're having issues, they haven't made a peep about it and they aren't answer emails or support tickets.

Hmm. I've only withdrawn from gox never deposited. 
I dunno, maybe I'm crazy then. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:36:43
They were lagged.  See original post.
@_date: 2013-05-12 15:51:28
Yup.  This. 
@_date: 2013-07-16 20:23:45
No.  Just two different people's wallets. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 19:53:18
Pretty awesome stuff.  Does/will the site cost anything to use?  How will you be monetizing the site?  Link for the lazy:  
Also, needs more wubwub.
@_date: 2013-09-13 21:36:15
You're incorrect.
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:56:58
Very awesome of you to speak openly and honestly.  Good information in this thread too.  I'm sorry you lost money but it seems that it's been a learning experience for everyone.  
The best thing for everyone to take away from this is MAKE SURE you have yubi or / OTP enabled not only for logging in, but also for withdrawals and everything. 
Regardless, thanks for being clear and honest OP.
@_date: 2013-07-16 21:37:29
[They replied on Facebook](
@_date: 2013-07-18 05:10:21
So with today's BTC price, what will those shares pay you out?
@_date: 2013-07-22 18:12:16
Exactly. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:33:26
Neat.  Any others have good luck with this site?  It is reputable?
