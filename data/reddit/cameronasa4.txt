exactly what I was thinking.. But they realize they cant stop it therefore they are going to have to do something about it

and where did you get it from? I never saw it drop to that on coinbase
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:29:53
I never saw coinbase at $400 is simply all I am saying. I saw it at $496 last night but that was the lowest I saw it go

I just went ahead and bought 10 with my first purchase, so thankful I did because they have already gone up over $100 from when I got them!

unfortunately I don't think it will fall below $450 again.. Last night may have been the lowest price you would have ever seen again at $490 each on coinbase

Amen man, thanks for your input. When I bought my bitcoins I told my self this is long term and it is still that way. no thoughts about cashing out

Sorry, I am just not familiar with reddit as I have not been using it a long time.

wait, how long did it take them to flag you as risky? mine should arrive on monday November 18th. No reason it should be flagged as risky as I have way enough money in my bank account. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:14:33
thank you! I didn't know about that!
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:24:37
Hmm, well I am talking in regards to coinbase, and coinbase is currently at 620 a btc.

he said his life doesn't depend on the 4k he is about to spend..

I consider it more like stabilizing. For one, it never dropped to $400 it was more or less around the 500-550 area. Also that 500-550 is 200 bucks more than it was last monday
