Liberty is everyone having the right to copy whatever they want using their own tangible property. Tangible property is anything you can touch- land, tools, materials etc. As long as everyone has the right to utilize their tangible property and personal knowledge to produce or reproduce whatever they think they can sell, the result is a free market in which consumers have multiple sources for similar or identical goods and more people are able to employ themselves and become financially independent. This reduces dependence on jobs and welfare, which improves wages and benefits and lowers taxes.
The only way copyright can be enforced is to deprive everyone of their tangible property rights. This doesn't secure liberty, it destroys it. By giving anyone ownership over the knowledge and ideas in other people's minds, the law is essentially giving them ownership over other people. The result is a captive market in which there is very little competition or opportunity for self-employment. Big businesses and local governments routinely collude to plan the economy out for years in advance. More people depend on  jobs, keeping job markets constantly saturated, depressing wages and benefits and increasing demands on welfare. If you've ever felt like a slave, it's because you are.

It doesn't take 30 minutes to clear a transaction. It might take 30 minutes for miners to confirm a transaction but any business running a full node can validate a transaction instantly with the right software.

This isn't pointless. The point of removing inputs is to eliminate the ability of 3rd parties to track our spending. The point of pruning spent uxtos, empty blocks and old blocks is to greatly simplify and speed up transaction confirmations and eliminate a great deal of blockchain bloat. And the point of regenerating lost coins through the block reward is to maintain the coin supply so it isn't drained out of existence. Reversing transactions would not only be theft but a potential attack vector. Transactions should never be reversible.

I bought 0.3 BTC for $100 back in Nov 2013 when the price was $333 and thought the price was high. Then life happened and my attention was focused on other things until June of 2014 when I discovered that the price had fallen to around $290 so I cashed out. Now it's easy to see in hindsight that the price was actually very low and the price drop was nothing compared to what we see all the time now. The same will be true ten years from now when the price is well above $20k. Think long term.

Why wouldn't it 100x again? As it becomes more widely accepted it's going to disperse and become more scarce and scarcity will force the value up. As the value inclines, the prices of goods in BTC will decline while the price/conversion rate to USD will incline. This makes perfect sense since the dollar is constantly losing value due to inflation while Bitcoin is constantly gaining value due to deflation and popularity. $10k is nothing! 1 BTC will soon be $100k and then a $100m. There will only ever be 21 million coins but there will be 2.1 quadrillion Satoshies!  At some point a gallon of milk is going to cost $10 or 149 Sat.

You can't validate a blockchain based on it's transaction data. You validate it based on it's proof of work. If an attacker manages to convince the network to accept a fake blockchain, the fake transaction history can only be used to validate fake transactions.

Exaggerated estimates of the ecological impact of Bitcoin are almost always based on the simple assumption that the miners are all running off the grid. Bitcoin actually incentivizes miners to seek far cheaper sources of power. They use solar, wind, geothermal, and hydroelectric power as much as possible. They also tend to be located in colder climates where cooling is free. Some farms are so efficient they even reclaim energy from venting warm air.
@_date: 2019-11-20 18:17:29


I'm not talking about deleting inputs, I'm talking about not including them in the first place so that they're not part of the merkle root or block hash and therefore not required to validate them.


I'm only saying this about old blocks, not new ones. New blocks would still be validated by the network as usual so even 100% hashrate isn't going to permit forgery. But, by the time a block has been buried under a hundred other blocks, the risk of it being altered or replaced in any way is so immeasurably small that it's no longer necessary to retain inputs just so everyone can re-confirm what has already been confirmed a million times.

I would NOT buy Bitcoin. I would contact the developers and ask them to change some things:
1. Make the output structures of all coinbase transactions the 'coinbase' and omit the input structures.
2. Omit the input structures from all non-coinbase txs in new blocks before they're hashed.
3. Always prune spent transaction outputs and discard empty blocks when they become the oldest (last) block.
4. Discard blocks older than ten years or 525,600 blocks to get rid of lost transaction outputs.
5. Subtract lost coins from the coin supply and extend the block reward so that it returns to 21 million.

As long as you have the genuine blockchain, you don't need transaction history.

How so? Nobody can spend a transaction without a valid signature. This isn't changed.

Nodes can still validate blocks using the transaction data in their mempools. Of course, you don't want to discard that data until a block is at least a few blocks deep on the main chain. At that point, new nodes don't need to bother repeating the work that was already done for a block to be where it is. The blockchain itself validates it's UTXOs.

To create fake coins, an attacker would need to overcome two obstacles:
1. The network of honest peers who only relay valid data
2. The total hashrate of honest miners
To overcome honest peers, an attacker needs to circumvent them with his own network of dishonest peers that relay his false data. Synced nodes can't be fooled by this so his only potential victims are nodes that are currently trying to sync with the network. They go by the rule that the genuine blockchain is the longest blockchain with the highest average difficulty. So the attacker also needs to control one or more mining nodes that possess more CPU power than the honest network. Thus the hashrate of the honest network is what prevents
forgery, not transaction history.
@_date: 2019-11-03 00:02:25
Even the largest mining pool doesn't control enough hashrate to manipulate the price as you describe. Even if they did, the trade off would be worse than the gain. Miners would lose both mining opportunity and create volatility that would jeopardize demand among consumers and merchants.
A Ponzi scheme is about fooling late investors into believing that the profits of a non-existent company are coming from sales rather than the funds of early investors. So the only Ponzi schemes in Bitcoin are those who treat it like an investment. It's not an investment! All this speculative day-trading is why the price is so volatile and volatility is what's making adoption difficult. My pricing formula is designed to stabilize the price so it can become the currency it was meant to be.

Nodes can find the inputs of every transaction in a block by matching them with the transactions still in their mempools. At that point, they don't need the entire history of transactions to validate (or invalidate) those inputs, they just need to confirm that they point to valid UTXOs.
@_date: 2019-11-20 02:16:12
Everyone would know that all transactions expire in 10 years, or block height 525,601, therefore, everyone would make it a point to spend their coins back to themselves well in advance of the last block to prove that they aren't lost. Wallet software should do this automatically.

Bitcoin has two hash chains- the blockchain and the hash chain of transactions. Both do the same thing in recording a history of work. But the hash chain of transactions was only necessary before the blockchain was added to the protocol. Now it's redundant.
@_date: 2019-11-15 23:42:40
First we use proof of work to identify the genuine blockchain during network sync. After we download the correct blockchain, we can use it's transaction data to validate new blocks we get from miners.
But we don't need to trace every input in a new block back to the genesis block, we just confirm that they all point to valid UTXOs. We can do that with our mempool data so transaction inputs don't even need to be stored in the blockchain.
Transaction history is only good for enabling third parties to trace your transactions and for taking up 250GB of storage instead of 25GB.

New nodes can identify the genuine blockchain by trusting the longest blockchain containing the greatest proof of work. This is based on the assumption that the majority of CPU power is dedicated to protecting the network. It helps to secure transaction history but it doesn't depend on it.

@_date: 2019-11-16 21:20:09
I think you're confusing blockchain validation with new block validation. Blockchain validation is based ONLY on proof-of-work because nothing else can be trusted. Once you have the genuine blockchain you can validate new blocks. New block validation depends on confirming both the proof-of-work and transaction inputs. Transaction inputs can be confirmed with mempool data so it doesn't need to be saved in the blockchain. I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking about.

Whether it's land, art, coins, comic books, stocks, bonds, or Bitcoins, if you have a hundred thousand units of something worth $10,000, that makes you a billionaire. The trick is seeing the potential value of something early on and grabbing as much of it as you can before the market realizes it's value.

Bitcoin is a fixed money supply which means it doesn't support savings. In order to support savings, a currency needs to be inflationary. This is why governments support fractional reserve banking. Bitcoin is at risk if being hoarded out of existence before it achieves mainstream adoption.
Bitcoin needs three major changes before it can achieve mainstream adoption:
1. Become inflationary by maintaining a constant block reward.
2. Improve privacy and reduce the size of the blockchain by omitting input data.
3. Make pruning mode the default mode for all nodes.
4. Make all transactions expire after 525,600 blocks, about ten years, to eliminate lost coins.

If not, it will likely be outlawed and lose all value.

The intrinsic value of bitcoin is it's security- the fact that it can't easily be counterfeited. The security of bitcoin is directly tied to the hash rate of the Bitcoin network so that's what should determine the price, very precisely. We need to devise and standardize an unambiguous process that anyone can use to determine the price based on the current hash rate. Something like $1 per 10k TH/s. That would put it at $10k at 100M TH/s.

Ya, that's the problem. As long as the market completely disregards the hash rate, the price is a minimal incentive for miners to mine therefore it does little to improve the hash rate. On the other hand, if the market price were pegged to the hash rate, as it should be, it would become much more of an incentive to mine and the price would follow the hash rate.

A  VAT does NOT work like a sales tax. It's not applied once at a single point, it cascades like a tariff applied every time something moves, at  every stage of the production and distribution pipeline. A 10% VAT could  easily cost you 50% or more. That's why it's usually a much lower  percentage, like 1% or 2%. Not only would a VAT disrupt domestic  productivity, consumers are already taxed too much on income and charged  too much on sales. A VAT is an unnecessary double tax we can't afford.
A  better idea is to replace the income tax with a national consumption tax but instead of applying it exclusively, like a typical state sales tax, it should be included in the shelf price. The elimination of payroll taxes would allow employers to cut wages and salaries so that current net incomes remain the same. This, in turn, reduces the wholesale cost of goods allowing the sales tax to be added without raising prices. Follow this up with a monthly refund of the tax to all citizens on all spending at the poverty level and you have the fair tax.
