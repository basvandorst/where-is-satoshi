Where do you live and what constitutes 'I can't get a gun'? As far as I knew, guns are sold at Walmart. Are there differences across the states? I'm not from there so genuinely interested to see how it differs. On that, I'm 4 years into a law degree, currently studying constitutional law here in Australia. Our constitution is obviously quite different from yours, but one of the overarching principles of constitutional (and also statutory) interpretation is that literal interpretation does not and should not be considered appropriate as a blanket approach. The intention of the framers is irrelevant; the constitution is its own entity that has a status separate from the ideals of your 'founding fathers'. To apply a literal approach to its interpretation in accordance with their views would be to apply legal doctrines to situations in current society that could not have possibly been contemplated at the time of their creation. That's not to say that there should be discretion to interpret it as one sees fit, but there is scope for rights and duties to be implied from the text as a whole. Otherwise absurdities or errors in its operation that may yet to be uncovered would have to be strictly adhered to with no recourse (other than an amendment, of course).

Mate you can brag to me all you like about your country going to shit... I would love to see that.
That aside, I do see what you're saying and I agree on some levels that governmental power in the States is indeed corrupt, but I'd say that's more to do with corporate lobbying and the banking system than the failings of the Constitution. 
I've really told you all you need to know, so no need to argue further. The bottom line is that the Constitution carries much more weight than you seem to think. If you really think that it can simply be interpreted with unlimited discretion, than you obviously didn't take the 10 minutes to read up on the information I gave you. Also, if a Constitution is only worth as much as it's ability to withstand change, why are amendments a thing? Simply astounding logic, mate.

Except it does? Isn't that the reason your country hasn't enforced gun control to deal with the problem of people getting shot all the time - because of a piece of paper?

I never said you could glean from it whatever you want.

Just because I agree with established principles does not mean independent and impartial thought was not used in drawing that conclusion. You just want to be edgy. Nobody gives a fuck.

Thanks for enlightening me oh holy edge lord. How could I have been so blind to the truth? You are my greatest saviour.

Correct me if I'm wrong but isn't the separation of powers in your country constitutionally entrenched?

??? The entire common law system is based on the doctrine of precedent. Google 'stare decisis'. To use 'logic' would be to rely on judicial discretion as to what is 'logical'; you are literally defeating your own point.

No, it's whatever the person(s) appointed to have judicial power to oversee interpretation of the Constitution in accordance with established legal principles and the rule of law decides. The rule of law underpins any decision of the judiciary in ensuring its validity. To interpret the text literally would be to undermine established principles of legal interpretation. 
For example:
In a UK case from 1955, Section 8(1) of the Food and Drugs Act 1955 (UK) prohibited sale of ‘any food intended for, but unfit for, human consumption’. Children asked to buy lemonade, and a man sold them corrosive caustic soda which they drank, causing serious injury.
If we were to interpret this literally, there would be no breaking of the law, as caustic soda is not 'food', nor is it normally 'intended for ... human consumption' under the literal reading of the provision.
Seeing as this was obviously absurd, the court used a purposive approach to interpretation to hold that the expression 'sells any food' must be taken to mean 'sells anything (whether a food or not) as a food'. The purpose of the legislation was to protect the public from harmful products being sold as food, so this interpretation had to be the correct one. The man was found guilty and justice was served, as you Americans might say.
I hope that paints the picture for you.
The same principles apply to the Constitutional text; albeit there are much more nuanced rules and different theories for how it should be done in practice. Most interpretation is textual, in that the purpose of the material is gleaned from the text itself and not extraneous materials (such as parliamentary debates in forming the legislation). However that is not to say that it is LITERAL, which would be extremely inefficient and produce absurd results as demonstrated above.
Read up on [Strict Constructionism]( [Textualism]( and then  [Originalism]( and ask any questions you might still have once you've learnt a bit about how it all works. It does seem that in the American context regard can be had to the original intention of the framers, though their intention is not necessarily the overriding consideration in coming to an interpretive conclusion.

They don't, did you read anything I said? Go back and read.

What position? I literally disputed everything you said.

There's at least one of us that needs to use their brain more and it's not me.
