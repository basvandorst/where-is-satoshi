i bet that entire industries are built around the cumbersome traditional "proving business" and won't fall quietly

if this isn't hardcore evidence of usury I don't know what is

real money, as opposed to bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-03 14:17:58


if due to an arbitrary limit placed by your bank, then you should really change banks

sorry i made &gt; 9k edits to my other reply, please see it again
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:22:21
sorry just had another editing fit, please see the parallel comments of mine

why are those people so snobby and "head in the sand" about bitcoin
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:10:21
yup, that key point about the systematic depreciation of wealth
some will kick and scream and become petulant saboteurs before resolving their cognitive dissonance
there's been  some evil manipulation of mankind going on for ***far too long*** and it needs to stop now
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:00:41
that's kind of the mentality of central bankers when they print funny money, 
but in actuality they're siphoning wealth from some people  to some other people, and (nearly transparently) destroying all wealth to boot!
scarce money like gold was basically the only stalwart against this tyranny, until now
very exciting indeed
dollars to donuts (no I've never used that phrase before)  that there are people long past (talking centuries) whose plans are still in effect because their opposition's money became merely inflationary currency and inflated into oblivion.  Those diabolical schemes wouldn't have been possible with the prominence of sound money.

humans in general are not "soft hearted", so why would Wall-Street inhabitants be any different?
@_date: 2014-01-04 12:44:34
doesn't matter who it is they will exploit and take advantage if they're bad wall-street person or not
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:59:26
How many times do people try to judge the volatility of Bitcoin and fail to realize the speed in which traditional currency is designed to depreciate?
If you don't have the whole picture then you might as well be mentally falling down some stairs or something.
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:35:59
war and poverty depend on the central banks' ability to sap and channel mankind's energy, at least the kind of wars we've been in since the Vietnam War.
all of that will change when sanity starts to kick in due to *real* and sound money
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:21:23
I'm somehow missing the connection with what I said about "systematic depreciation of wealth" and the reason you said this.  but I agree.  The Internet might be a prime example of wealth from nothing.  wealth in the form of trust is one too I suppose.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:44:44


you really should coin a new name for it
FDIC and crypto currencies together just seems like a broken marriage
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:51:29
the price of Bitcoin most definitely is correlated to the deflation of funny money
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:15:06
maybe not the individual bankers themselves but the system they are using remains, always ripe for the current trendy methods of abuse, and there are some who may be more aware of it and abuse it and are never caught.
then there are some who see the dysfunction but have no choice but to participate because taxation by force and all that jazz
you can't even "own land" without being a slave to somebody by owing taxes on it, so eventually any land is essentially rented and there goes any hope of having any resemblance of soverignty
stake a claim my ass
"and then we told them dot gif"
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:42:25


I've heard this before but I'm skeptical.
I think the central bankers will erect ever changing barriers to entry that will slow growth, even more than their already snobby semi-illegal attitude towards "bitcoin customers".
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:24:21
the hardware would remain the same i would imagine
bar mining techniques
And there's no reason that POS hardware can't support a wide variety of altcoins.

@_date: 2014-01-01 21:11:00
frankenmint didn't say that it's a "means to an end"
edit:  money isn't, but stable money makes life easier and I think BTC is magnitudes more sound than whatever wannabe money currently in opposition
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:31:39
true because backing fiat with guns and debt is definitely a weightier factor
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:17:16
Some see motivation negatively because they hate themselves.
You don't even have to blink in their direction, just keep on keepin on!

they were
about the same time revelations about the automatic GPS tracking scandal
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:32:37
they thought of something a bitcoin proponent would say and then transposed it and blurted it out.


seems to happen a lot when there is no actual reasoning to be done


no fucking shit captain obvious

tax via deflation
so basically either devalue your savings by participating, or you go to jail by force
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:45:42
apparently Charles loves talking to himself
@_date: 2013-12-31 23:27:02
the government has no money
deflation is the new taxation/slavery/whatever
you go away
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:45:44
currently or 100 years from now
bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general
who can claim to know all these things is full of shit
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:53:17
at least it's having them think about what "fluctuation risk" is
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:47:41
same as with guns and drugs
the same self serving bullshit-loop
@_date: 2013-12-25 07:43:10
i can see employers demanding no qr codes be revealed OTJ and to do so would be to "subvert the establishment"
of course the state can't ban bitcoin it would prompt the state's demise
@_date: 2013-12-28 08:50:02
"fluctuation risk" won't be avoided by buying USD
