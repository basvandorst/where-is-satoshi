I love 4 figure BTC. It'll be tasty when it reaches 6 figures.

That's nice of you to let us buy your BTC at a discounted price!
Seriously though, that sucks. But to reduce that just buy now and hodl like hell.

I think he's related to the hacker known as 4chan

If you use a VPN to search it, it will change the exchange rate shown (based on country) but still shows the same currency results.

I get same thing in incognito. Maybe try it to see what comes up in your country

Nope -- same thing in incognito mode. Used a VPN server in different countries and the USD to local currency result changed, but not the recommended currency searches.

Tried it with a few VPN servers in other countries, it changes the exchange rate between usd and their local currency, but still shows the same results for related currency searches.

I'm seeing a lot of comments saying it's based on browser history -- it seems not to be in this case. 
I tried in incognito mode, and then in another browser using VPNs in Central Asia, Europe, etc. All the same. If you don't believe me, take 2 seconds to try it yourself.

I ran it in incognito mode and then using a couple different VPN servers in other countries. Same result

Most appreciated. Thanks for the free advertising, Google!

What is this, a crossover episode?
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:56:18
Have you even taken 2 seconds to try it? Even in incognito mode it appears, as it does again with another browser + VPN.
Imagine being such a kissless virgin neckbeard that you think intelligence is based on how old your reddit account is.

See my other comments -- tried in incognito mode, same thing. Tried using a VPN server in different countries, the USD-local currency would change but not the suggested search.
