If only your country made their own reddit.

There are idiots on Reddit who cannot argue with anyone without going through their post history to try to find a single thing you might have said sometimes even years ago and hold if over you and say: AHA!!!!! You said this 7 months and 3 days ago so your current argument is invalid.
And since reddit does not respect individual privacy people like me switch accounts every few months to aviod that stupid shit. So trying to dismiss someone's opinion because of how old their reddit account is I repeat is pretty retarded.
You seem like the person who "cherishes" their worthless Karma so im guessing you like to pander for upvotes and a downvote would hurt your ego. Your mind is therefore unable to understand why would anyone dispose of their accounts with such precious Karma in them. Newsflash: Its worthless.

I mean, you are the one judging someone's opinion based on how old their reddit account is. Which is pretty retarded.

but remember, kylie jenner is a true "self made" billionaire.

Yeah its horrible that the democrats are importing millions of illegals to come and vote for them.
@_date: 2019-07-04 18:14:30
anyone who treats a reddit account as anything but disposable has never had a unpopular opinion.
@_date: 2019-07-04 21:19:49
Loads of them. Mentions 1.

You care about all that shit, the vast majority of people dont. The average person couldnt give less of a fuck about decentralization, they have been using banks for centuries. They dont care about how awesome of a technology their money is, they just want to be able to go to the store and buy shit. The people who care about all that shit are already into crypto, the people who arent into crypto arent going to adopt crypto because muh blockchain and decentralization. 
Ive been using the internet since the 90s, the vast majority of people didnt care to go on the internet until they could press a button on their phones and go in.

And that is why mass adoption will never happen unless a global crisis where fiat just completely crashes. And at that point, any coin could be the answer.
@_date: 2019-10-06 13:26:23


And if it is decentralized?


Well the market do care, one of the main reasons for Bitcoin's dominance apart from being the first coin is that its the easiest coin that can be traded directly for fiat. Most people need to buy bitcoin first to then buy any other coin, and if they cash out they have to trade to bitcoin first to then sell for fiat. So all coins are tied to Bitcoin. 
IMO the first coin that makes it easy to buy with a simple debit card with no hassle and a thousand hoops to jump through wins.

Well one of Bitcoin's biggest flaws is its public ledger. A lot of people see this as a plus but if this is intended to use as an every day currency I dont think a lot of people will be happy knowing every single transaction they ever make is publicly available for everyone to see.
So I can see people preferring something with a bit more privacy.
@_date: 2019-10-07 04:20:10
So you just want Bitcoin to be your private caiman island? Good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-10-07 21:06:40
well good luck with that.
@_date: 2019-10-06 10:12:32
There are literally thousands of other crypto, someone could eventually create a coin better, easier and more secure than Bitcoin.
