The general population thinks Bitcoin has a CEO so I'm going to have to disagree with you.

The Bitcoin Foundation in general is toxic simply because of its name.  It would be like a private company calling itself "The Federal USD Foundation" or something.  Too many people attribute them as somehow controlling or founding Bitcoin.

Hey just wanted to say I think you're doing a fine job all things considered.  Ideally I think it would be great to have everything decentralized, but we aren't quite there.
You were thrust in to these positions and are doing amazing considering.
I think overall you have far far far helped Bitcoin more than you could ever potentially hurt it with the power you have.  So thanks for that at least.  I'm sure when the time comes and the community is ready you will have a way to properly distribute your control.
Thank you for openly discussing this and not just deleting posts about this by the way.

Well if you ever need help feel free to hit me up.  You probably don't remember me (I switch accounts frequently for security), but we talked a really long time ago about SMF security (I manage a very large SMF community as well).  I've been involved in Bitcoin since 2011 and work from home with my own hosting and web development company.
Always willing to lend a hand to help Bitcoin and I'm definitely more than qualified.  If there's ever a day you think you need to reach out to people feel free to PM me.

Kind of scary, he could easily still have complete and sole access to all the funds somewhere and there's nothing anyone can do to get it back.  He could simply do his jail time then get out and recover millions.  Would also be very easy to bribe officials.
A good example of Bitcoin's strengths being used for something bad.  A lesson in not trusting third parties for sure.

I don't really see how that term relates to two-step verification?  A callback by that definition is just a way to route a call through a different country to make it cheaper...what...
Again, I am in security, never heard it called this.  Not saying it's wrong, but this honestly seems like another case where Bitcoin users are using a buzz word they don't understand.  It's beside the point too, it's just semantics.
This community is very frustrating and confusing sometimes.  I am being downvoted while being pretty reasonable I think while a guy talking about security being easy and adding another faulty social step to security is being upvoted.
I used to come here and we'd have pretty good discussions about the technical aspects of Bitcoin but now I feel like it's just a bunch of armchair experts/day-traders spouting nonsense...can't say anything negative that might hurt the price and can't defend a company or you're a shill...this community is really letting greed and paranoia kill themselves slowly.
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:37:33
Eh I don't really think they meant it like that.  Bitcoin is inherently non-secure in the same way cash or precious metal is.  The system itself is solid, but it is up to you to secure it.  Advancements in "Bitcoin cybersecurity" would certainly cover numerous systems that we have now that help people and businesses better secure their Bitcoin and I think that's what they're talking about.
If someone said "due to cash security advancements, we can further protect funds" people wouldn't take it as some hit at cash.  They'd probably think it just meant they got a better safe.
I only say this because I don't like how people get all defensive of Bitcoin when it comes to security.  It IS inherently not secure.  You absolutely cannot just use Bitcoin out of the box.  The protocol has no inherent direct security built in to it, and the default clients have very minimal security.  If someone gets access to an unencrypted wallet, your Bitcoins are gone.
People really need to be aware of this but I feel like any criticism of Bitcoin is stomped down because people are so obsessed with price these days.  If you really want Bitcoin to grow long term, less attacks via information and being honest are going to help that more than people falsely believing it's flawless.

Callbacks traditionally mean a function that is called by another function which takes the first function as a parameter and it's also vaguely use to really describe anything passing data to another system after something happens: 
Not saying your wrong, but really haven't heard it used like you're using it which is why I was a little confused.  I would just call what you're talking about two-step verification (think it would technically fall under two-factor as well).
But ultimately I agree having something in their culture that provided far more verification than just an email would have been smart.  I don't think just vocal confirmation is particularly secure (it's still keeping things in the realm of social engineering) and I think there are easier and far more secure cryptological options, but it's definitely a thought in the right direction.
I am actually a professional security auditor and steganographer so I am actually very aware with how much care should go in to transferring large amounts of money but I highly disagree with you that it's "easy" to mitigate risk.  It's easy to be an armchair security expert when you have hindsight, but the attitude that expecting everything at all levels of security and humanity is "easy" is exactly what gets people in to these situations in the first place.
All I'm saying is that security is a very very serious business.  It just takes one hole to get through.  In hindsight, it ALWAYS seems like that hole should have been easy to fix, but in preparation, it's an incredible task to patch every hole before launch.  I would go a bit easier on them.
@_date: 2015-09-17 22:38:32
Excellent way to handle this.  Great job BitPay.  Winning the insurance claim would be a huge step forward for Bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2015-09-18 12:48:13
EVERY security hole is a small hole to patch in HINDSIGHT.
Also picking up a phone is just another social step vulnerable to same type of attack with a simple "hey I lost my phone this is an important client we need to send the money now."
Why add another social step when you can make a solid cryptological step that REQUIRES multi-step or multi-sig verification.  For example, a text to his phone asking for confirmation to send the money via a code from a separate two-factor device only he carries.
I don't get this ridiculous "oh man a social attack could have been fixed with more social steps durr" shit I keep seeing here.  It's like people who know nothing about security saying you should have just put a padlock on the server Jesus fucking Christ I hate what this community has become (ok I'm exaggerating but geez really people no wonder everyone is leaving this sub).
Then it's like, we are faced with thousands of different attacks and every time one happens people are like "pfft amateurs so easy to stop."  Yeah no shit after an attack happens it's easy to tell how to stop it but to prevent all THOUSANDS of those attacks to happen is a large task it is very easy to miss one (and all it takes is one) don't act like it's just incompetence.  This could happen to absolutely anyone and we need to admit that so we can beef up security.  I'm tired of seeing EVERY Bitcoin hacking attributed to "they were just dumb it can't happen to me" this is exactly why hackings keep happening.  Just fucking admit that security is complex and we need better standards in place.
@_date: 2015-09-18 00:21:08
Well I mean the hacker got access to the CEO's email and most of his accounts. Most callbacks would have been sent to one of those accounts.
The real issue here is a pretty lax protocol with how Bitcoins are handled internally.  It's easy and pointless to point out any one thing that could have prevented it in retrospect, but because the entire company culture of social security was lax, it's not unlikely a hacker could have bypassed a simple callback as well.
The solution isn't any one thing, it's a huge rework of their social protocol and security.  If I had to guess, I would imagine it was a partially inside job too (e.g. ex-employee, contractor, third party who has access to their data center, etc).  So you need to make a system secure enough to prevent even your closest confidants (and yourself) from abusing it which is a very complex solution.
I only say this because people like to simplify these attacks I think to make themselves feel better.  Like "oh they're so dumb they didn't even do this one basic thing" as if it was just one small hole to patch.  In reality there were probably thousands of holes in this wall and we are just seeing the one they crawled through.
@_date: 2015-09-18 14:56:37
Are you joking?  Impersonating a CFO is not a risk for you?  Do you really think a basic phone call is something a social hacker would not be able to bypass?  You could get someone who sounds like him, pretend the phone systems are down, coerce him in to making the call, OR the CFO could be leading the attack itself.  When dealing with a digital currency like Bitcoin you cannot trust anyone with that much power.
Also I highly doubt you're in any position to hire someone let alone fire, but if you are firing someone, especially someone on your security team for being overly cautious and further challenging you, you are an idiot.  I started this off as a really civil discussion and you dragged this in to some dumb ass pissing match to stroke your own ego at the risk of everyone's security.
I am not familiar with COSO but ERM generally does not touch executives that high up unless there is also board for oversight.  It also does not have a huge focus on network security as most of these standards started in the 80s.  It's about general conduct.  If you would like to tell me specifically what part of a basic implementation of COSO would have solved this, I'd be happy to correct myself.  Perhaps it really has updated to be Bitcoin compliant and I'm just ignorant.  And please, do not keep pointing out completely antiquated and ridiculous measures like a fucking personal phone call.  The scenario I pulled out of my ass (message to personal device, two-factor device confirmation, multi-sig) makes a fucking personal phone call completely useless.  It's a completely unnecessary security measure that means nothing if it's still a person on the other end verifying it and having all the power to make that transaction.
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:46:54


Also can I just say this is bullshit?  People are using a term in a completely non-standard way that I've never heard and I'm downvoted because I ask for clarification and point out it's not used like that at all?
I was just trying to save the original user of callback some embarrassment in the future.  I knew what he meant and was just like "uh yeah I think you wanna say two-step or two-factor" but no apparently I'm the idiot. 
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:43:31
So I think where we disagree is that this way low hanging fruit.  This was a pretty precise social engineering hack accompanied by a possibly very sophisticated cross script attack accompanied by several other hacks to set up the social attack.  Many ERM frameworks could have been in place that would not have caught this as they rely heavily on the fact that most theft can be reversed and that most executives are trusted.  They're more about accountability and catching leaks, not super equipped to deal with a digital, liquid commodity like Bitcoin.
The hacker essentially became the CFO.  You need a system in place that can prevent even the highest executives from stealing.  You need a system that YOU yourself can't even break without consensus.  COSO does not cover this at all.
I also would just add some precaution.  While I think applying a standard security protocol is smart for most companies and seems like a basic covering of bases, it's also a false sense of security.
My larger point here is that Bitcoin needs an ERM framework that does not exist yet.
@_date: 2015-09-18 13:09:55
Yeah it's crazy thanks for being somewhat reasonable at least.
Also I said this in another comment, but I don't get why people think a phone call is the end-all solution.






@_date: 2015-09-25 19:15:56
Yeah I'm not arguing/nor do I care about technical semantics and wasn't going after just you, just the general tone of this thread (and the community in general) was that it was not a serious attack or that they made a dumb mistake.  Just wanted to clarify that this was a multi tiered attack with far more than just a phish.
Entire emails and computers were compromised in order to make the final confidence attack.
The best security could have failed with this kind of attention and people need to understand that to protect themselves.
@_date: 2015-09-25 16:31:37
I've said this here before, but any time a security breach happens in this community, people love to chalk it up to "they were just stupid I don't need to be worried."  **EVERY** SECURITY BREACH SEEMS SIMPLE IN HINDSIGHT.  When you have a giant wall it can be hard to find every hole.  But when someone points out a small hole it does seem silly how easily it could have been patched but finding every single small hole is the hard part, not patching them.
This attack was an extremely well designed multi staged social and technical engineering feat. It was a combination of incredible technology, in depth intelligence as to how their company worked, multiple compromised computers, and expert social engineering skills. 
Don't simplify it as just a "phishing attack."
When I say shit like this, people accuse me of being a shill for BitPay.  I say this for nearly every hack.  And here, let me dispel those myths: BitPay is a shitty company you should never ever use but if we keep acting like they (and anyone else who is attacked) was just stupid, we are going to keep having these attacks and Bitcoin will keep suffering.
Go through every hack on Bitcoin companies in the last 3 years.  See how everyone called each one "their fault they were dumb."  Now look at how long and diversified that list is and how hard it would be to know about and fix every single one before launch.

The locking the coins is actually interesting but I think that is a concept that would be more effective if added to a coin that already has a market presence. A plain fork of Bitcoin with this doesn't really seem to have much of a chance.


No offense but it seems like they just made a really simple change then put a fuck ton of money in to marketing. The coin has a huge incentive for pump and dump (e.g. "the sooner you get in the more you'll make also lock your coins for even more money while we sell and you can't offload!"). 
I'm not saying they are just trying to make money, but they put themselves in a great position to just make money.
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:24:04
I was a big part of the mining scene before it became impossible to mine effectively in the US. There aren't individual miners mining Bitcoin anymore. We have all moved to alt coins because it's more efficient to mine alts and sell them for BTC: 
Bitcoin mining is mainly in China now where electricity/space/cooling is cheapest and equipment is easier to manufacture faster.
Even the Chinese minors hit razor thin profits. Many of the mining outfits have stock with public reports and you can see the less than impressive returns. Or you can just calculate out the hash rate vs their electricity usage and figure their medium income. It's pretty plain to see.
Many of these outfits have tiers of legacy miners that are no longer efficient and they remain off unless the difficultly goes down or the price goes up to justify using them.
The reason you can reasonably know profits are razor thin is because their is mining equipment out their that is off. Any opportunity would is immediately filled until it is just below the margin of profit. On top of that, you have plenty of people mining at a loss for various reasons which drives profits down even further.
You can make decent money off of mining alts but it is a full time job to keep switch and speculating and upgrading equipment.

Yeah just a reminder that forgetting your password is far more likely than someone hacking you.
Unless you are some big business, write your password down somewhere easy to remember. I mean even email it to yourself. Put it on a sticky on your computer.
Hackers need both parts, they need your wallet and the password. Putting the password in plain site somewhere isn't bad unless it's in the same place as your wallet.
@_date: 2016-05-31 15:19:15
Assuming current reward and difficulty. As with every time an ASIC generation comes out, the difficulty jumps and the ROI starts increasing steadily until ROI is no longer reachable in BTC. With rewards halving, this is even more true.
Yeah you might be able to get ROI in USD if the price of BTC goes up, but if that's the case then it would have been a better investment to just buy straight BTC instead of buying mining equipment.
@_date: 2016-05-22 17:10:36
It is of course, but OP seems to be more worried about the illegality rather than losing any significant amount of money.
I would rather just eat up to $20k on $90k and have the cash then spend potentially years laundering physical assets and risking a much worse audit. If he truly kept zero records this would really be his best option if he really wanted to go all fiat right away.
I'm just saying most people think reporting your taxes incorrectly and not keeping records = jail time. No, **under reporting** your taxes is what is illegal. If you are just fairly generous with your estimates, they won't question it. If you do get audited, the worst that happens is you have to pay the taxes you do owe + maybe some small fines.

I would agree with you but Reddit's system actually doesn't really allow for that which I think is a big failure of Reddit.
If you get downvoted enough, your post frequency on a subreddit becomes limited until you basically can't post anymore.
This is why every sub basically eventually devolves in to an extreme circlejerk they just push everyone out until there's only people who agree left.

With halving and difficulty increasing I really doubt that. I think the ROI would be more like 5 years+ for BTC ROI.
@_date: 2016-05-19 11:43:55
I don't think it was really a great idea.
Crowdfunding in general is already kind of a bad idea with a lot of people being scammed. Add Bitcoin to the mess and it's just scam city. Same with equity based around Bitcoin.
As much as people here hate regulation and stuff, investing and crowdfunding really don't work without some consumer protection. It's really not something suited for Bitcoin alone. It's something that can be made much better with Bitcoin, but pure Bitcoin based crowdfunding and investing is insane to me.
I mean people get all excited to send Bitcoin for crowdfunding or for investing but think about it, would you mail cash to some guy you don't know to fund some product or as an investment? Probably not.
@_date: 2016-05-28 16:00:54
Seems a bit silly. You are just taking Bitcoin but making it highly inflationary and creating a huge wealth disparity. If everyone gets 5% APR then the price of the coin is just constantly going down by that rate as well.
It seems like a fun concept for a game though. Trying to see who can out chicken the other investors with locking their coins longer to get a higher return. Really strong incentive for early adoption too in terms of doing a pump and dump.
I like the concept of locking coins though for some relative incentive. Something like that could stabilize a market if it were incorporated in to a more popular coin.

You can appreciate recognition and still want to do good. You are trying to make this some purist black and white thing, it's not.
I can love helping the poor and be selfless about it but if I show up to the soup kitchen every day and people just spit in my face and don't appreciate it I'm going to reconsider if what I'm doing is good at all.
I'm not going to demand they thank me but my moral is also going to die if everyone is being a dick. People do good because it is rewarding and it's rewarding because people show gratitude or you can at least see improvement in what you're trying to help.
Why do we teach people to say thanks when someone does something? Should we stop doing that too?
@_date: 2016-05-24 12:16:27
I'm confused why you think this. I am a miner and I haven't been mining on Bitcoin for over two years now because I can make more BTC by mining alts and selling it for BTC.
For many people the halving is going to provide the financial incentive to do that. It's basic free market I'm not sure what you think theor motivation would be to keep mining at a loss.
@_date: 2016-05-30 23:40:38


They do politically. Yes if there was a major hijack by core devs we could get enough people to switch. If it's a minor change the general public doesn't understand, core development always wins.
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:12:07


I'm sure they see it but it's just too risky at this point. Bitcoin hasn't been around relatively long at all. The price is crazy volatile. The tech is extremely complicated and hard for an average person to understand.
We also don't really know how Bitcoin is going to handle some different issues it's facing like the halving, block limit, mining centralization, legislation, etc.
I am very bullish, I understand Bitcoin very well, I know this community very well, but I would still never recommend a major investment in Bitcoin as this point. Too many loose ends still.
@_date: 2016-05-22 15:43:16
You're right but if you are paying the maximum amount the IRS isn't going to care. If they investigate and have you justify all the money, you could only end up paying less taxes than a capital gains tax on an original $0 investment.
They might uncover some questionably illegal activity but the IRS is not interested in prosecuting you for that they just want their taxes.

I know this is probably going to be unpopular here, but I think Eth's popularity surge got a lot more people excited and in to crypto again which bumped up Bitcoin's price.
As someone who got in to Bitcoin for the tech, I felt I largely exhausted everything technical I wanted to do with Bitcoin and have not been active in the community for over a year.
With Eth coming out, it gave me an opportunity to try out contracts, something I wanted in Bitcoin for a long time. Got me excited and back in to my old Bitcoin projects and I think the pressure from Eth is also creating pressure for Lightning/side chains which also got me a lot more interested in Bitcoin again.
I always find the hate for alts funny. Bitcoin dev is so political it is very hard to push through major changes. Alts are great ways to try new things then apply them to Bitcoin. I think alts as a long term investment is probably bad, but for short term tech dev they are great.
@_date: 2016-05-23 15:50:34
It really isn't. The consequences are for miners in that it CAN take more space and bandwidth. They are blocking a major improvement for the whole Bitcoin ecosystem to save cents on storage and bandwidth.
Yes you can argue that the Bitcoin eco system should solve this naturally, but that's dumb. We are only at 1 MB (keep in mind it used to be 32 MB) and we don't have side chains ready. A 1 MB increase is really a no brainer.
Yes yes, I am fine with low block size limit encouraging off chain transactions, but we aren't ready for that.
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:00:40
This is reminding me of the whole "sidechains are out RIP altcoins!" thing...
Just annoying that people see alts as "competition" to Bitcoin and they over hype anything that brings their doom.
I think Eth has been a monumental contribution to the crypto community. It is teaching us so much about programmable contracts that we have been waiting for, for years. Eth being out will improve Bitcoin's contracts almost certainly.
Things can coexist people and you don't have to worry about a "better" tech coming along to dethrone Bitcoin. Bitcoin hasn't been the best tech for some time, but it remains dominant because of the infrastructure built around it and the massive amount of support.
@_date: 2016-05-19 13:03:40
The most recent I can think of are just the problems with the block size limits. Just people who go in to incredible technical detail about how the block size limit staying the same or not staying the same is detrimental and the end of Bitcoin.
For certain specific parties it may be detrimental, but for Bitcoin as a whole either option isn't a huge deal or anywhere close to the end of it.
Another one is side chains and how they kill alt coins. So many people felt threatened by alt coins that so much misinformation about side chains was spread because they were somehow the magic bullet to end alt coins. I don't have a huge opinion on alt coins, but people were basically just completely misinterpreting what side chains could do and making incredibly detailed technical analysis that were doomed because they were based on false information.
Same with programmable contracts. Programmable contracts don't have nearly the utility people think they do.
@_date: 2016-05-30 15:15:37


Geez it is a tech guys not some god or king. Yeah Coinbase did some shitty things but introducing new coins to trade is not one of them. Every exchange trades more than one coin and I don't really consider alts competition as much as I consider them contributors to the same community of cryptocurrency.
As a programmer, Eth has brought me something that I have been waiting for in Bitcoin for a long long time. Bitcoin is still my prime coin and prime investment, but Eth is absolutely great in bringing up contracts early and showing us how they could be implemented. It will almost certainly help our implementation when it comes to Bitcoin and it also significantly boosted development of side chains.

Did you try to claim more than the BTC that was in your account? Was your account not verified did you enter in any incorrect information?
My claim approved, I only asked for the BTC I had in my account, my account was verified so I assume that helped.
Unfortunately at this point I don't think there's much you can do other than getting a lawyer and doing something very complicated and expensive. I would be surprised if we got 5% back of our claims though so I kind of doubt that would be worth it for you.

If someone does something good for you, you should do your best appreciate that and try to give back what you can.

It could easily die before it ever hits ROI. Plenty of ASICs are so inefficient now that it would take them over a decade to hit ROI and it's more likely they will die before then.

It's possible but going from $0 to $100 is much easier than $500 to $5000. Gold has a market cap of trillions and I don't think it's impossible for Bitcoin to get there but it would require Bitcoin being a thing the entire world uses and sees as valuable. That could take decades if not centuries.


That's really not the force here. As the price goes up, it becomes harder and harder to go up. It is reverse exponentialism if anything.

The multi-sig pay as projects goes on sounds cool but could still be abused pretty easy. You just have to make sure you have a majority of the donations and then you can control everyone else's payout.
The auto funding when goal is a really neat concept but honestly it doesn't add much practical value. And again could be abused by someone just funding their own project.
I mean it's a really neat idea I just don't know how much application it really has. I was excited for it at first but as time goes on I'm just like "do we really need this?"

I have problems with your estimates, but even with your numbers I think you calculations are off.
If you set the difficulty to 140000000000 (more than a 30% drop), set a difficulty increase rate to 5%, free power, set reward to 12.5 BTC, then put in the stats for the S9, you still get a 243 day ROI.
I think that's being pretty generous too. I don't think the difficulty is going to drop that much and I don't think we are going to see a stable 5% increase gradually. I think we are going to see a HUGE increase in difficulty as new miners hit the market (as we have seen in the past), then we might see it stabilize to 5%. 
The average increase doesn't matter. It's the initial increase that kills you. We have seen double difficulty in just months when there's a price swing or a mining breakthrough and it completely wipes out current gen BTC ROI. If there is even a bump of difficult by a 10% average for a couple of months early on, the ROI for the S9 becomes infinity.
Yes you might get USD ROI with a price bump but like I said, a USD ROI is a loss compared to just buying Bitcoin directly.
After hitting ROI, you and then making pennies after that. You are taking HUGE risk to get a base return on your investment, and even if you get that, you are only making maybe another 5% on that before your miner is taking a days to generate a penny. Buying mining equipment really does not make sense to me unless you are FPGA/GPU mining the most profitable alt or manufacturing the hardware yourself.

You say you bought the Bitcoins for $0 (can say you mined them), you cash out and pay the maximum gains. The IRS isn't going to investigate because there is no way you could have paid more money in taxes. If they do investigate and have you justify everything, you'd only be paying less.
If they uncover questionably legal activity, it is not their job to prosecute you nor do they care. They just want their taxes and you are already paying the max you can do they aren't going to investigate.
This is far safer than trying to buy stuff with Bitcoin to launder it. If you suddenly have $90k worth of property you have no record of paying taxes on, then they would ream you.
The IRS isn't as big and scary as everyone here thinks they are. They are very reasonable and only care if you are trying to write off things you shouldn't be. If you are trying to pay your taxes the best you can they will help you out.

I hate most of this community. The crypto community. I got in to crypto in 2011 because I was interested in the tech, now everyone has a greed based agenda.
You have $1 of Bitcoin? Bitcoin is the best thing every fuck everything else downvote anything interesting or make up lies about shit you perceive as threatening it. Ignore any technical issues I have no idea what I'm talking about but I will completely freeze up development because I refuse to accept that Bitcoin isn't perfect.
You have $1 of Eth the next day? Bitcoin is dead Eth is Bitcoin 2.0 blah blah!
I used to invest hours in reading in to tech and I can't anymore. Sometimes I get through extremely complicated technical documents for something I'm interested in only to find out that most of it is a lie to make something look good or bad or is extremely over hyped.
As a programmer it's impossible to work in this environment. Programmers rely on being able to trust people's technical opinions, we can't research every little detail for ourselves, but you can't trust anyone's opinion in this community. People go in to huge hour long videos about "major security concerns" that after spending days and weeks comprehending I find out they're not really that big of a deal and it was largely just trying to make something look bad.
This is the only real issue I have with Bitcoin. I don't think Bitcoin is dead or anything, but I don't think anyone ever anticipated how much of a detriment the culture would be to development as soon as the uninformed staring pushing their opinions or as soon as market manipulators got involved.

Yeah they very clearly sell them at razor thin margins for current predictions which I think is kind of shitty. You are offloading a huge risk on this people and giving them very little potential back.
I just think Bitcoin volatility (in mining, price, etc) is so crazy that mining is always pretty dumb. Something crazy could happen to make mining jump 100% easy. Or the price swings down way low and people who don't understand mining for coin, not USD, turn off their miners.
I haven't seen a single ASIC or GPU miner hit their coin ROI (but again USD ROI is a pointless metric) without the miner selling their hardware also. There's always been something happen completely out of predictions. Selling their hardware to me is just passing the loss down essentially which isn't really cool or viable.
GPU mining was great (and is great if you do alts) because you can at least build gaming PCs or something with the hardware afterwards.

Finding numbers and studies on an emerging tech like Bitcoin mining isn't going to happen but you can ask and miner and it's simple free market logic.
As long as the cost of power is less than what you are making you will mine. Since mining is saturated, there's people out there who leave on their obsolete miners until the very second they are losing money.

That's great and all but dev have been mainly focused on fine tuning the client and other things that are largely inconsequential to the protocol.
The protocol is what is stagnant. A huge majority of the features that were planned for Bitcoin that people were hoping for stopped being added in as soon as Bitcoin got big. It became too political to change the protocol.
I mean we can't even decide on a block size limit (a largely pointless decision) I don't see how it will possible to implement any real protocol change.
This isn't a bad thing and it's not the developers faults. I mean a lot of people's jobs depend on Bitcoin and it's good that they are cautious in adding things. But don't pretend it's not stagnant. I mean side chains and lightning exist specifically because they are answers to how stagnant Bitcoin dev has gotten.
I think as long as we have side chains in the works and have alt coins to let us play with ideas before implementing them on Bitcoin, we will be fine. 
I just hate people who scream that Bitcoin is perfect and nothing is wrong like it is their flawless god or something. The one thing that will truly kill Bitcoin is if we act like it's perfect all the time.

If I had to guess, people are cranking up their miners before the halving to get as much as they can before the rewards are decreased. 
Then we will almost definitely see a significant decrease in miners. It's really no question. Many miners are operating at very thin margins, with the halving it just won't make sense for them financially to keep mining unless fees match the rewards (they won't).
I'm not sure why people think this is a bad thing though. The network is already plenty secure. Even if half the miners the left we aren't really facing any major issues.
If you're worried about price, the halving adds scarcity so if anything the price will be going up.

Are you talking to people mining Bitcoin? Because if they are talking about BTC being profitable they are lying to you or they get basically free electricity and cooling somehow. If you are being told this by a cloud miner or stock you are investing in, they are lying to you to get more of your money before they jump ship.
@_date: 2016-05-31 00:53:10
Of course not but you're underestimating the power of them being seen as the official Bitcoin source. If there is a change we don't want we have to convince a lot of uninformed people to hotness that client. It would be really really hard to do.

No. Do your best is not "you must give x amount."
I don't think it's ridiculous to ask people to say thanks to people who helped them. I don't think it's ridiculous for people to get pissed off when they help someone and they don't thank them.

Geez this is really exaggerated wording I hate how extreme this community is sometimes. These were not attacks on Bitcoin. They were pretty reasonable forks that core dev wouldn't implement.

The proposed version of releasing the funds I heard is that if a certain amount of the donators approved the progress all the funds would be released. So if the owner bought the majority of the funding they could always get the funds released.
The version you're talking about really adds no value over a fiat crowd fund. Same with the released funding. It just makes it more dangerous for the consumer and crowd funding is already heavily not consumer sided.
I just don't really think crypto brings as much value to crowd funding as we would have hoped other than the standard value of low fees and avoiding potentially oppressive suppression.

Because they are no longer just trading Bitcoin? Seems pretty obvious I don't get all the conspiracy theories.

That doesn't really matter. If you can wait for enough people to lock then dump you have a much more effective pump and dump where the masses can't try to bail out before it's too late.
I'm not saying that will happen it just seems like a way you could abuse this. It is a feature that makes sense in an established market, but for a new coin facing insane volatility it just seems likely to be abused by early adopters for small profit.

Technically isn't anything that consumes electricity 100% heat efficient? You get the same amount of heat from anything with the same amount of electricity.
Like it might not replace the efficiency of a heat pump, but it could replace your heating elements for when the weather is too cold for just a heat pump.

You don't have to believe it it's just human nature. If you have a culture that thanks people more people are going to do things for people. Not every is pondering "hmm why am I truly doing this I should be purely altruistic!"
No no one thinks that deep you can hope they do but they don't.

That isn't Bitcoin's point. People put political slants on something that is just a technical standard. All Bitcoin is suppose to be is decentralized currency. No matter how many people own Bitcoin, it can still be used for that.
The real problem is not someone buying all the Bitcoin, it is someone buying all the miners.

I mean that's like getting in to the whole complexity of morality and junk, but in general if someone helps you out you should at least ask if there's anything you can do for them. We should be encouraging good behavior.
When we don't appreciate people who do good things, it makes the incentive to do bad things greater. This is how regulation happens. If we don't self regulate as a community and return misspent coins and encouraging returns of misspent coins by rewarding those people, then regulation is going to step in to force people to return coins and then we are all worse off as a community.
This guy could have easily just kept the 38 BTC but he would have planted a seed in the guy he took from that Bitcoin is flawed or maybe even he would try to get the police involved and that happens enough and it paves way for Bitcoin becoming illegal or regulated. He should be rewarded to show people that good deeds don't go unnoticed so that others may follow his suit.
I'm not saying like give him a huge cut or whatever, but if he had returned my coins I would ask him if there was absolutely anything I could do for him. I mean that is 100% of a thing I would not have if it were not for their kindness. I could spare 99% of it and still be ahead.
If you are someone doing something good though, obviously it's great if you can just not expect anything back. But not everyone is that altruistic. Some people struggle, some people it's very tempting, the last message you want to send the people who struggle is that you get absolutely nothing in return for doing something good.

If you mine for coin then basically the only situation where you are at an advantage is the one you described where you buy a miner at a high BTC price and mining during a crash. The ROI for most people is pegged to USD so it makes sense.
However, I would still argue it would just make more sense to buy if you thought the price was undervalued.

Okay going to step in as a neutral party here. Eth has protocol stuff a lot of us were waiting for in Bitcoin. It's fun to play with and see the possibilities we have been waiting for for years.
I don't think it's going to replace Bitcoin but its a great example of why alts are awesome sometimes. Bitcoin is important many peope for their jobs, major protocol changes and features need to be scrutinized heavily and that is why dev is slow which is a good thing I think.
I'm not going to start accepting Eth on my eCommerce site, Eth doesn't have the years of relative stability and investment that Bitcoin has. But I do want to use Eth to check out programmable contracts.
I don't get why it's so polarizing with people. I don't get how people don't see how this is complimentary. Eth coming out has already shown us a lot of huge problems with contracts that we will now be ready for when planning it for Bitcoin. It's great but everyone acts like we are enemies ugh.

The mining attack thing is more of a threat than people think. The protection really is that there is no incentive to run such an expensive sustained attack like that. It also wouldn't be extremely hard to switch crypto algorithms during an attack and hard fork the network. It would fuck over a ton of miners but Bitcoin would survive. Or just wait until the person attacking runs out of money to keep running the attack.
I mean one great thing alt coins show us is how rare and not practical 51% attacks are. So many alt coins that have no where near the mining protection of Bitcoin and they are relative unharmed. It's because there's really not a lot of practical application for a double spend. Or practical application for sustained disruption of the network. You can also peg the clients to certain blocks manually to make the attack even harder.

Made an account just for this!
I love your service and have had nothing but excellent experiences with it.  This point system really seals the deal though, you guys are my favorite Bitcoin company by far now!
I operate a custom computer building company and we're heavily invested in Bitcoin/cryptocurrency (we build/built a lot of mining rigs).
We needed to buy a new expensive machine to help us fabricate our computer cases so I decided to use Gyft and Amazon.  
Was very pleasantly surprised to find out that we had tens of thousands of points this morning!  We will definitively be using those and hopefully we can get some fun gift cards for our employees!
