OMG can anyone just answer the question or attempt to? Sure yes  I understand I should ask if my govt represents my interests and all that. That is not my question . My question is what happens when govt makes it illegal for companies to accept crypto and your crypto becomes worthless? Especially for someone who has converted all their fiat to crypto?

Sorry for that it was my first reddit post ever and when I went back to read it i noticed that the full post didn’t appear unless one clicked on it. Now I know the entire post can go into the subject.

Thanks smeggletoot I’ll read up on that.

Go to Coinbase or gdax and you’ll see what I mean if you set up a new account and want to do it. An option is credit card or bank account. If you select bank account you need to give plaid.com username and password to online bank account. That’s where I stopped. I’m going to wire $ tomorrow instead. Even though it says you can obviously change password later.

Astar thanks for comments. I’m not leaving the country I’m in any time soon. Govt I imagine has ability and authority to shut down companies that accept crypto if it wants to. What then? Crypto will be almost worthless because it cannot be used.

That is an awesome comic
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:57:16
Yoda  it is not up to me. If companies are fearful and won’t accept crypto because its outlawed then crypto becomes worthless. If companies decide to play by government’s rule are we all really going to attempt to get them to use crypto?  Even while the companies are being fined and or shutdown?
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:50:57
Yes but I’m not leaving the country even tho I know it’s messed up. This is home for now. My true concern is what happens when crypto is outlawed?

Oh that’s cute.
@_date: 2017-10-08 14:08:00
Yoda I’m neither.  Just curious as to your thoughts.  What would YOU do, what would you actually do, if the govt outlaws crypto and your coins become worthless?
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:08:28
Can I?
