The people behind it are not lovable.  They are deliberately deceiving newcomers into thinking BCash is Bitcoin.  .... and of course the majority of us on are Hodling the 'original' currency.

It's when you use a kick drum...(or any audio really) to compress another sound.
A good example would be using a vocal to compress a soundtrack.  Usefull for nature documentarys or computer games.
Another use would be to use a kick to compress a bass or synth giving the sound a pulsing effect, dependant on the length of release.

the idea that this is surprising to the majority of people is the NUMBER ONE reason?

Companies that manipulate conversation, persuade via hive-mind and generally sway opinion, specifically target accounts like yours. You tick every box for them.  Your reply here just makes you EVEN MORE SUSPICIOUS!

Cancer research doesn't need more money.  Huge breakthroughs happen all the time, nothing is followed through.  Too many players in big pharmacy need people to keep taking their meds.  Need people to get 'incurable' diseases.

You know the movie "Back to the Future 2" , where Biff is given an Almanac that contains all the future results of major sporting events?  He is able to accurately bet on incoming games, it's really useful for making money.  Unfortunately you need a time machine to have this level of power, or you need to steal one like he did.  In the Movie.  "Back to the future 2".
