The bug is being addressed. It works for some, not others.

This was a standard A/B test. The platform we used was Optimizely.
Wikimedia flagged the same challenge re: how more choice results in lower conversion:
What this means: We haven't found a way to integrate bitcoin into our funnel that doesn't have a net negative effect.
What this doesn't mean: We've stopped experimenting with how to integrate bitcoin so it has a net positive effect.
We engage in dozens and dozens of A/B tests during our campaigns. We're fortunate to have a level of traffic where we can get statistically significant results in less than a day. We do all of this work in the open, blogging about the results (and our other activities) at fundraising.mozilla.org.
We intend to keep playing with how to do this properly. Whether it's new options on the page, separate forms, separate campaigns, etc.
So ideas on how to make bitcoin have a net positive effect on fundraising are completely welcome. =) Best way to contribute to that conversation is through 
In the meantime, we're still accepting bitcoin here:

Coinbase is working on the bug right now.
No reason it wasn't added sooner, other than process. It's been supported as a good idea the whole way through.

It took us nearly a year. =)

Should be fixed.

"Edit: Also, Jimbo Wales from Wikipedia already explained in a post why proposing more donation options paradoxically reduces the number of donators."
This is true.

Just an e-mail for our internal reporting purposes.

I should add that this just went live today.
We're a large organization and it takes us a while to move things through legal, privacy, and security review. There were a lot of steps to getting this in place, but we got it done.
There's a larger communications strategy about it starting later today.

That is my Twitter feed, yes.
Thanks for the links! I will have a look at them.
Much appreciated.

Took us a long time, but here it is!
Live today.
Hi All. I'm the Head of Development for Mozilla (in the non-profit sense of the term), which includes fundraising.
I'm happy to do the work researching whether we should takebitcoin donations if you could point me to the right resources.
There are a number of people on my team advocating for it, as well.
Tal.
