No its not meaningless. Of course there will be others that want to take your rights, and the world is much more complex than black or white.  However liberty has always been there for the taking for anybody who wants it.  Of course life and liberty come with risks, we can die any moment. There is a never ending animating contest of liberty.  I think the words of Patrick Henry sum it up well:  "I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death."

Well as the reward drops, miners will simply shut off their machines or switch to a different coin or sidechain.  If they tried to team up and fork the system, it wouldn't go over very well.  Attacking the system would probably cause the price to drop if they are successful, meaning they would actually have less incentive to attack the network than to play by the rules. 
Also if they did this and the majority of people were against it, the devs could probably roll back the blockchain and relaunch the system.  Think of Bitcoin as not a technological system, but as simply a public ledger.  As long as this ledger is intact, I see a good chance of the system being able to launch itself back up again even after such an attack.
Edit:  Also the real cost is not $15.70.  It actually costs much less to secure the network.  The only reason it is so high right now is because we are still in the distribution stage of Bitcoin.  One of the biggest hurdles to overcome when launching a new currency is how to fairly distribute it.

We live in an imperfect world.  Libertarianism doesn't fix all of societies problems.  But its the best system there is.  Capitalism and freedom are what made America the most prosperous nation on earth.  We need very limited government to allow the economy to thrive.  You are right to hate the corporations, but realize they grow in size and power because they seize government through regulatory capture.  This is how they maintain oligopolies.  They do it by seizing government power.  Limit this government as much as possible, and you will limit the problems.  Don't blame capitalism for the problems.  The real problem is that the government intervenes in capitalism.  
You are right the mathematics and technology can solve problems. The whole reason government claims to exist anyways is also to solve problems.  But humans, the free market, technology, and mathematics solve problems a lot better.  Yeah things may seem imperfect, but those imperfections and problems in capitalism are opportunities as well. 
Take a simple example of the roads.  There are tons of traffic accidents all the time, people dying in car wrecks.  Its a horrible tragedy.  So what do we do? We make traffic laws.  Lots of rules and regulations, and licenses.  But these rules impede innovation.  Right now we already have the tech to have automatic computer driving vehicles that are 100% safe and barely ever crash.  But because of government rules, its unfeasible for any entrepeneurs to implement such a system or private roadways.  If we had freedom this tech would already be everywhere.  But instead we have to wait for government approvals over time, and its going to take much much longer before we have self driving cars.  Even if people claim the tech is not there yet.  If we had freedom, the incentives would speed up innovation a lot faster, and we would be much more technologically advanced today.
As humans advance we find solutions to problems, and too often its government, which is holding these innovations and solutions back.  Government after all is incentivized to create more problems because then they have an excuse to get more tax money.  You are right in appealing to the mathematics and technology as the solution instead of government.  But you may be missing the forest through the trees because actually the ones who implement that math and tech are entrepeneurs and free market people.
I know we are all just trying to find the truth.  I dont mean to rant, we probably agree on most things, but hopefully I have offered some food for your thoughts.

Ethereum is not that great.  Yeah its cool and interesting and allows some new things, but is there really a huge market for it? Anything Ethereum can do, can be adopted by Bitcoin on a sidechain.

Governments rarely work for the people, because special interests capture the government power by buying off politicians.  A free market system is best.  Free market capitalism creates prosperity and results in the best quality of life for the most amount of people.  If you are a humanitarian then you should be for free markets.
Its best to have as limited government as possible, as the Founding Fathers suggested.  They knew that government power must be restrained and that is why they said it must be chained down by the constitution.
Charities today are largely scams and tax havens for rich as well, largely due to government corruption.  Bill gates for example doesn't like the world population growing, so he uses his tax free Bill and Melinda Gates foundation to [push for vaccinations]( that sterilize women in third world countries. His foundation works closely with UNICEF and the UN who were caught recently sterilizing people in Africa with anti-fertility chemical agents hidden in vaccines:  [Mass Sterilization: Kenyan Doctors Find Anti-fertility Agent in UN Tetanus Vaccine](

Its not so much about anonymity, but privacy, of which anonymity plays an important role especially in finances.  Financial privacy is very important.  Privacy could be considered "hiding", but that isn't necessarily a bad thing and it is not much of a voluntary prison at all.  A real prison is where you are watched all the time, its called a "panopticon".  If a prisoner in a panopticon institution wants freedom to smoke a cigarette, he better hide from the guards, and remain anonymous when they smell the smoke.

Huh?  My guess is you are calculating the $25 by looking at the reward for mining blocks and dividing it by the average number of transactions.  What you are saying is very misleading and wrong.  The only reason the block reward is so high right now is because its in the distribution phase.  Satoshi brilliantly designed it so the distribution would happen over many years and gradually taper off.  Over time the average cost of the transaction the way you calculate it is going to be reduced.  For example in 2016 the block reward is cut in half.  
Maybe you are the one that should learn some basic math?  Possibly stop worshipping government and hating libertarian entrepeneurs who actually produce and build things in this country.

Safest way is to generate the keys using dice.  Next safest way is to use Bitcoin Core client and a bootable USB, and keep them in cold storage without spending. Its best to use Bitcoin Core because it has the most eyes on its random number generator.  Also since it is not an HD wallet like trezor it doesn't have vulnerabilities because of attacks on ECDSA encryption.  Here is a good cold storage tutorial: 
But if you want more convenience and still pretty rock solid security you could go with Trezor, and its convenient for spending.

Yes I have noticed this as well.  Its the people who are heavily invested in alt-coins that are mostly against sidechains.  And I dont mean just invested financially.  I mean its people who are working on big alt-coin projects and have invested a lot of time and energy in them.
This is seen for example by Vitalik Buterin, the leader of the Ethereum project.  He kind of attacked Bitcoiners/sidechainers calling them "bitcoin maximalists" because they want sidechains.  Its pretty cringeworthy.  I have heard a lot of others angry that sidechains threaten their alt-coin projects as well.  Basically they hate for Bitcoin to be a winner.  They want to stop sidechains and inhibit Bitcoin for their own gains.  Who are they to tell us we can't have sidechains?

Well its an interesting question to imagine whether or not a sidechain could become the main chain, and I am not technical enough to answer it.  However Bitcoin would act in a way like the reserve currency for all sidechains.  My guess is there will be sidechains for anonymity or faster confirmation times, micro-payments, ethereum, etc..  The trick is with a 2-way peg you can always switch from the sidechain back to Bitcoin. 
I think what is going to happen possibly is there will be a sidechain with small inflation, that offers both anonymity, and faster confirms.  People will want to use this sidechain for spending and transferring as its faster and more private.  But in order to secure the sidechain, there may be some inflation and incentive for miners to mine it.  So you will transfer your 1 BTC to the sidechain and use it for spending.  But over time, if you want to change back to Bitcoin a year later, you might only get 0.95 BTC.  This will make the Bitcoin chain the preferred chain for saving, and the sidechain the preferred chain for spending.  Also the Bitcoin chain will likely be more secure because of the network effect and the huge mining operatings supporting it.  If a sidechain became more secure than the Bitcoin chain, then things might get interesting however, and I am not smart enough to tell you what will happen.

Lack of privacy actually empowers the mega criminals at the top who have seized governments.  They will use it against you, and use it to secure their criminal operations.

I don't think the fees will be a percentage of the transaction, but rather a fixed fee, which will incentivize larger transactions, and disincentivize micro transactions.  This problem may be helped out by sidechains and having a sidechain that is tailored for micro transactions.  Sidechains could also have inflation if needed and if that is what the market demanded.

Not really the same as banks and FIAT.  The central banks can print the FIAT out of thin air.  So actually you can think of them as holding an infinite amount of the FIAT.  They have the choice to make it so &gt;99.9999% of all the FIAT is concentrated in their hands if they print enough money.  Probably they won't take it to this extreme, but they can try to take it as extreme as possible, it depends on what the people put up with and accept.

To address the reason for the bubble, I think its mostly from some large holders that were taking profits.  There were early adopters with lot of bitcoins, and still are.  Those early holders selling are what causes the price crash from those bubbles.  Actually its not so bad a thing for the long term, because it helps to distribute the coins more evenly.  As time goes on, the volatility will decrease as these larger holders sell off a majority of their coins.
There was a study I saw in a coindesk article, it found that most large holders of Bitcoin sold the marjority of their coins.

The trolls really love to use price as their ammunition.  Anyone against Bitcoin, will just try to claim victory just because the price is down from where it was.  Its pretty lame really.  The trolls did the same thing when the price dropped from $30 to $2 in the first bubble.  
Just because the market is so stupid because of Fed QE policies, and scams, which Peter Schiff knows full well about, does not mean Bitcoin is not sound money and is not reaching wider adoption.  
We are launching a brand new currency, and nobody said its going to be smooth or easy.  A lot of coins were concentrated in a small number of hands, which is why it takes a lot of volatility to shake those coins out for better distribution.
Bitcoin has has wild success.  VC's have invested over 400 million dollars into Bitcoin companies, and that is just what we know about.  This is over 10% of Bitcoin's entire market cap alone, and probably a lot more when considering lost coins.  This market is so tiny, and the world financial system is so corrupt and fragile like a house of cards, its only a matter of time before people FLEE into bitcoin and other assets like gold and silver.  Peter Schiff should really know this, but he has a psychological leaning towards his gold and silver business, and Bitcoin competes with that.
Anyways you think those VCs are going to let Bitcoin price fade away, and lose their hundreds of millions of investment? No they are going to pump the price, which is extremely easy for them because the market is so small.  If I were those VC's I would accumulate as much as possible in this infaltionary, distribution stage.  Then when it gets close to the halving in 2016, pump it to new highs.

A sidechain is like an alternate chain to Bitcoin, it could have different features and stuff.  A 1 way pegged chain could exist already.  You would move your coins from the Bitcoin chain to the 1-way pegged chain by destroying your bitcoin forever.  The act of destroying the Bitcoin creates a new coin on the sidechain.
Then there are 2 way pegs, which would require some updates to the Bitcoin protocol.  These updates would allow someone on a sidechain to in effect transfer the coin from the sidechain back to the main Bitcoin chain. It has a lot of implications, some of which are very interesting.

This was mostly because of MtGox not allowing withdrawals first for FIAT, and then for bitcoin.  Bitcoin was a premium there because people couldn't get FIAT out of MtGox.  So they would by up the price on Gox, then sell it on another exchange, which would account for the difference.

Then again if you use the same monicker and IP address on twitter as on facebook, it doesn't really matter much.  You have already put all your info out there for everyone to see, so changetip doesn't really reduce your privacy much.  Just be careful not to link your bitcoin addresses as well.

Well people want to get rich quick. But this is going to play out over several years.  I don't think $50 is very likely except for some kind of flash crash and the price would not stay there long.  Do you realize at $50 bitcoin the market cap would only be like $650 million.  VCs alone have invested over $400 million that we know about into Bitcoin startups.  Its just not very logical at this point for the price to fall that far for very long.
Also when it comes to the masses you are right, and that is why it takes time.   Look at the internet, nobody understood e-mail at the time either.

The willy bot at mtgox as responsible for the bubble is really just speculation, and has not really been proven at all.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:57:02
Is that all you care about, watching the price go down, so you can claim victory and feel good about yourself?  Look at the long-term graph the price is going up.  Anyone who has been in this longer than a year knows that.

I saw this scam a mile away, I tried to warn people and got flamed for it.  I just told them wait and see, you will all learn a valuable lesson.  I am glad some people are now learning.
All I had to do was see those scammer's faces on youtube, and how they present themself to know its a scam.  Then you hear of a guaranteed $20 floor, and then the scam is unquestionable.  I am amazed so many people fall for this sort of thing honestly.  
Its sad that the market is this dumb.  Maybe its because for so long we have had rigged markets by governments and oligolopilies.  The market has never evolved intelligence.  Its like if you domesticate an animal, then let them loose in the wild, they will never survive.  Newbs are getting eaten alive right now.  But live and learn.  They need to get spanked to learn their lesson.

The ShadowCash project already has a mobile POS wallet for both android and iphone.  They use stealth addresses in their Shadow send feature.  It went live 2 weeks ago.  Basically there are two units of account both SDC, which acts transparently like Bitcoin, and SDT (Shadow) which is anonymous using stealth addresses, ring signatures, and zero knowledge proofs.
[This presentation]( shows how it works.
They also have a Shadow Chat messenger built right into their official wallet, which is encrypted and private unlike skype.  They will add voice, video, and file support soon.
They also plan for a decentralized marketplace called ShadyBay as their next implemenation into the official wallet.
Also check out the [Tox project](  Its is a peer-to-peer encrypted messaging system, and they plan to implement Bitcoin in the future as well.

Yeah some will claim legal tender is that.  But I am sure there are other definitions as well.  Under certain definitions, this would mean it actually is legal tender in California.  The term is obviously ambiguous.  When you can't even use a stack of hundred dollar bills to buy a house because its suspicious of money laundering, you can hardly call dollars legal tender under the definition you just proposed.

You can buy facebook and twitter followers for cheap.  Politicians do this all the time.  Pretty sure Obama does this.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:40:50
They make impossible promises of keeping the "floor" of XPY at $20: 
This is enough proof right here to show they are scammers.  A lot of people got hurt because they were stupid enough to believe it.
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:31:24
There is definitely a privacy concern.  But its up to the user how they use the service.  If you want privacy, then take precautions.  Changetip is offering a very valuable service and I welcome them.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:18:16
How can you justify convincing newbs that the price would have a floor of $20 per coin?  A lot of them got hurt and it gives Bitcoin and crypto a bad name. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:54:43
You are a real scammer, and you are a piece of crap too.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:26:29
Actually I have heard VCs say that they will plan on pumping the price to get media exposure.  But now they are in the accumulation phase since the inflation rate is rather high right now for Bitcoin.  VCs don't invest over 400 million dollars into startups only to decide to cut their losses and walk away.  This is their profession.
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:42:00
There will be different sidechains with different features.  Its all about competition in a free market. The market will decide what is best, while maintaining Bitcoin's network effect. Its not a tax to early adopters either.  Early adopters helped launch bitcoin to where it is today. Everyone can still be early adopters, since the market cap is tiny and we are in the very very early stages.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:44:08
Wrong.  Go for 2.0?  Sidechains are the real bitcoin 2.0
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:51:37

Some people bought all the way up to $30 during the first bubble years ago.  Many of them had thousands of Bitcoin and when the price crashed down to $2, they sold EVERYTHING, only to regret it years later.
@_date: 2015-01-04 01:53:49
Is that why the mods removed your post?  What truth?  You want to tell us what you even think bitcoin 2.0 is?  Sidechains will make ethereum and anything else that claims to be the next best thing obsolete.  Counterparty already implemented ethereum on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:13:14
Its just the buttcoin troll army out in force.  They have lots of ammo because the price went under 300, they think they are winning, so they have come to declare victory.  Its sad really, they must have been losers their entire life, so they need this false victory more than anything.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:17:24
You really have nothing better to do with your time?  Bitcoin is not a failed currency at all.  Actually it has been wildy successful.  Trolls like you will be banned.
@_date: 2015-01-01 22:31:38
I heard you can do this using [bitrefill]( for a lot of other countries as well.  Anyone tried it?
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:49:48
Well even some crypto news publications have said the same thing:


Plus I have heard numerous people talking about it in the trollbox on crypsty and other places.
@_date: 2015-01-03 23:46:46
I just saw trolls posting suicide hotline threads at least two times now, rubbing it in that the price is down.  They just got deleted.  If you think the trolling isn't bad here, you'll find out.  Hopefully they will start being banned more effectively.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:03:03
My first tip, thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:08:21
I agree.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:08:08
They don't need to make money yet.  They are building their company and network.  They are building their customer base.  By offering 0 fees they are attracting a lot more customers, which makes their business more valuable to potential buyers of their company.  Also they have VC backing.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:45:02
I disagree, I think there is much ambiguity.  But I am sure they will say whatever they want.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:52:11
@_date: 2015-01-04 02:45:40
You said I haven't heard VCs say they will pump the price when actually I have heard this first hand.
@_date: 2015-01-03 14:02:50
This would be huge if true.  It would mean that Bitcoin is no longer considered property by the IRS, because it is an official legal tender somewhere.  This means its considered currency and not property, and therefore no capital gains taxes are owed when spending Bitcoin on goods and services.
Said the IRS:




If this is true, then it has legal tender status in the jurisdiction of California.  Meaning no capital gains requirement when using Bitcoin as currency.
@_date: 2015-01-03 17:57:00
Yeah it depends what you are using Bitcoin for.  If your only use is to invest in it to make profits then you pay capital gains obviously.  Just like you pay capital gains if you invest in Euros on the forex.  But if you buy some Euros to go to the zoo in Paris, but the exchange rate increases 10% from the time you buy them to the time you spend them at the zoo, you do NOT owe capital gains tax.  That would be preposterous.  
The same goes with Bitcoin.  If you use Bitcoin for trading or investing yeah you owe capital gains.  If you use Bitcoin as a currency, no you don't owe anything.
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:46:38
Yeah nobody follows that, I am sure you can make lot of lawyer arguments and stuff.  At the end of the day the IRS can harrass and audit and ruin anyone's life they want, which was shown by recent scandals and coverups by the IRS and Lois Lerner.

Sounds kind of like most of the stock market these days. Companies that have billion dollar evaluations, yet have no real strategy for monetization.

[Airbitz]( also has a pretty good Bitcoin business directory.  One thing I have found though is many businesses started accepting Bitcoin and then stopped because of lack of demand, so watch out for that.
@_date: 2015-01-04 03:23:32
I have looked into it, I didn't see any absolute proof of anything.  Its all speculation.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:44:40
Not at all, I am happy about that as well :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 22:51:18
It can't.  But sidechains could render Ethereum worthless.
@_date: 2015-01-04 00:46:03
Probably didn't happen.  Buttcoiners make fake stories like this all the time to make Bitcoin look bad.

For anyone who wants to play lawyer argument games, just look into the work of former IRS agent Joe Bannister who exposed how the entire income tax is a fraud.  Or Ron Paul who says the income tax is unconstitutional:

I don't think you can do this yet with mytrezor.com
But soon electrum 2.0 will be out with Trezor support and there you can select your own fee I am pretty sure.
You can try it in beta already.  [Here is a tutorial]( on how to set it up on Ubuntu/Linux mint

Ok, well if you want to call me a liar go ahead.  Just wait and see.  VCs don't invest 100s of millions in Bitcoin startups only to let Bitcoin die.

Sidechains offer a better solution to the scaling issue.  The cap will still have to be raised in the near future, but it will not raise indefinitely because sidechains will take care of it.

He made a fake thread once about how his kid asked him about bitcoin, then people were nice and gave him donations on changetip.  Then he laughed and told us all we are stupid for giving him money.  So hes a scammer too.  Morons crying against him?  You must be a buttcoiner too.

You don't have to put your info on changetip to use it.  You can register with changetip using an anonymous reddit account.  You can even hide your IP address using tools like VPN's or Tor.  You don't even need an e-mail to use it.
