I dunno man. I'm pretty happy.

I would check out Gemini but they emailed me a few months ago stating that they could not open an account for me at that time...
I had never actually registered. 
When I replied to support, it was all real weird so I just stuck with GDAX because they have never done me wrong...

Ledger. Never had an issue.

Electronics (TV, PS4, accessories)
Boring House stuff
I just about live off Bitcoin with the exception of bills and rent that are paid in cash. 
Shout out to gyft for making my life easier. I just wish they still gave reward points for Bitcoin purchases. 
@_date: 2017-02-22 16:16:30
Absolutely. I love my Ledger.

Traders make money. 
You need to take your lumps. Profits are wins

Wrong. Same keys, just a different address structure.

I used coinbase before gdax. I just sign in with the same credentials.

Yeah I can't imagine the guy with multiple millions being forced into marriage...
Nice try though.

Weird. They raised everybody's limits temporarily for the fork. Stop lying.

What? That is the dumbest shit I ever read.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:44:11
Dude. I totally agree. This thread is mind boggling

What also floats in water?
Very small BLOCKS

And in current news:

Don't let em get you down man. Some of these crypto nerds never even ventured to the darknet, the place that probably pumps their crypto more than anything else.
@_date: 2017-05-12 22:28:35
Yep or better yet, leave unsupported devices on the network. Good for them for their incompetence.

Bad move before a week of huge ETH and eth-based tokens announcements

Some say he is still waiting for the transaction to confirm ;)
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:27:05
I think he is saying because cb is known to "break" at the most opportune times.
