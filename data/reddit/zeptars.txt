If I had bitcoin to join in :)

Why did you not cover the whole thing. I would never show my wallet like this.
I'm triggered.

In the UK you now need to go to an interview for your passport. I went to the local post office who sorts it all and they said more than two weeks for a fast track. Thanks for the help though!

Thank you I thought you needed ID but I guess not. Are there any certain mobile apps you would suggest sweeping my paper wallet with?

Ever since I was around 17, just one year ago, I've been struggling for food, water and really just... just steam games. I'm close to breaking point. For just one dollar a month...
I'm kidding. That's amazing what you're doing, honestly. I wish I could do the same. You've done great.

Thanks for the reply I've been sat here at my computer staring at this post for 5 months. Finally someone answered. Cheers mate.

Wife not letting him do something? Yep, that's modern life dating for you.

It’s been like that not only for a while but a long while. Although I heard bitcoin was added as a crypto currency on coin base so that’s a step in the right direction.

Yes fees are built into the price you see on the 'Buy BTC screen'. Also of course transaction fee when you send it from the wallet on Bitbargain to your own wallet.

Sorry but it sounds more like greed was your issue and not trading itself.

bitbargain.co.uk - I have spent a lot there, with ID verification is even better. Sometimes people sell BTC with no fees on top, that is when I buy :)

Did you even read his name before replying? ;D

If you don't have ID like myself, you have a limit of spending up to £250 per day.

Honestly I was ignorant. I refused to research anything and didn't think there would be something better than what we have already. I saw people making bank too and I didn't hop in on it, that did make me envious of those people and that probably didn't help with my stance on bitcoin. I was always thinking it would crash and burn despite the gains I continued to say no one should get involved in 'such a thing'.
