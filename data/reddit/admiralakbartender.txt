No. Speculation driven by increasing prices. 
Bitcoin was less popular when it was cheaper. Granted, it accessiblity was the same.
Again,  OPs coin can be as divisible and accessible as you like, and it would make *zero* difference to its current attractiveness (which is currently at zero). 
You've identified two elements of bitcoins properties, but not the most important ones that drove the increase in price. They won't help OP if he has them, so how can they be primary elements?

Your coin is clearly valueless. Other coins are worth *something* and bitcoin is worth *heaps*.
That's the magic of CryptoCurrencies!
Id like to buy all your coins using a coin that I've just invented. However, since mine is worth more than yours, you are going to have to pay the difference in value back to me. In worthless fiat. Is that cool?

With all due respect, this is nonsense.
OP could make his coins infinitely divisible, and accessible to anyone and they would still be worthless.
Bitcoin's price is driven by speculation. The view that a bitcoin will be worth more in the future than it is today.
Unfortunately for OP, there is zero reason to think that Ops 'coin' will be worth more in the future than it is today.
The same is true for most ICOs, and eventually, Bitcoin

Um, pretty sure there is one obvious scenario where this  approach doesn't work...
