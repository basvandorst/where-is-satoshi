It's a transfer from a bank, not a purchase. I buy and sell on Gdax

Maybe one day I can buy a set of balls like that.

Yes, I want the price to go down so the poor folk (like me) can buy more. Also, so that it corrects and is better for the market in the long run.

I'm just too poor for it to make an impact. If there is a crash, I can buy it at a good price and get more skin in the game. Honestly, I trust in the concept a lot, but it's a lot harder to make 30% gains on something like $20,000 than $6000. Plus I'm waiting for coinbase to clear bank.

One of the main reasons it is volatile, is because everyone is still speculating what the value of a bitcoin is. I know that my one dollar is roughly equal to a small bag of chips. How much bitcoin is it (without first converting it to dollars)? By comparing it to a secondary currency, it's value is dependent on the perceived strength against that other currency. We need more companies to accept bitcoin, and also more transactions of bitcoin to calibrate.

I got lucky on a few gambles of low high today, and I pulled out most my bitcoin. A part of me doesn't want the greed to take over. Haha

Very true. Hopefully fees should lower from the network upgrades. I wonder what will happen if quantum computing becomes a thing

Why does it feel like Russian roulette? Lol

Haha just HODL. I tried to do that too a while back, and I almost got left in the dust waiting for a dip. Now, I just invest a little bit more each day, and if it dips, I will buy. Even if bitcoin goes down to $100 a coin, I will buy. Trust in the concept.

I have to look at the charts cause I rebuy every week.

I'm waiting for stupid coinbase to clear my bank. Hopefully it crashes hard then rebounds to the moon!

I've day traded bitcoin, and have actually made some decent money. There is always that dumb luck factor. If you use resistance lines/charts and other factors, then mix with a bit of patience it can be profitable. You got to go for small percentage gains, not the wild leaps from 14k-19k. I usually watch a chart and if it starts to pattern something like 15k- 17.5k back down to 15k then back up multiple times, I will try to sneak in and get some. I always try to have a bit of coin in the game incase you get those spikes. That being said, I'm not a pro, and this is not professional advice, it just works for me.
