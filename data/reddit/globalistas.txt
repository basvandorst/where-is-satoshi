According to the ID you provided, on the 14th november 420 coins moved to this address:
16th november, or 2 days later they moved out. Was it your address and did you move them out 2 days later? If 
 the answer is no, say goodbye to your coins unless the cops manage to catch the thieves.

"the S9 will produce** 0.285 BTC / $159 per month** and 3.36 BTC / $1939 per year.

On or before 14th November they reach settlement and husband sets up a wallet on her PC, sends her 420BTC (14th Nov), and gives her the transaction ID* as proof.
She then goes out of the country and shortly after (16th Nov) the coins are stolen. Coincidence? I think not.
*Notice how the tID ( is the only thing she can provide to us. Also, she's claiming 430BTC while there were just 420 in the wallet. Some buttcoin mama.

The answer is in the following questions:

- if you were held at gunpoint, no amount of hardware or software security would matter anyway, right?

@_date: 2014-03-12 18:25:08


But they did not stop trading until the 24th! If all btc withdrawals were halted on the 7th due to whatever, they should have halted trading as well.
Also, how many days "later" can you seriously discover that BTC is missing? If they suspected a bug on the 7th they surely must have known of the theft on the same day...

OK and what about the 880k address?
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:33:17
He's incriminating himself quite heavily right there. He's basically admitting that he knew about the stolen coins 2 weeks BEFORE he halted trading (7th Feb vs. 24th Feb).
Is he now so out of it to be making such primitive mistakes? Or am I not seeing some bigger play here?
Oh and saying stuff like "theft or disappearance", "caused or related to", "caused among others" ... I mean this guys does seem like he's lost it and is just going through the motions hoping for a miracle, doesn't he?

Thinking some more on the Bitstamp option, how exactly does it work? 
I mean in Coinbase, you can use your existing card that's tied to your bank account, meaning you can have money on Coinbase instantly, if I understand correctly.
Wheras Bitstamp are offering to issue you a card that you have to fund by wire transfers from your bank account, which is not instant? What would be the point, versus direct wires to Bitstamp account? Or am I missing something?

Good points.
For me personally this part is a major “scam alert” in Scrunty’s narrative:
“I pretty much did a forensic clean of my system again and again.
Every time I went through everything and was certain all bitcoin-related material was removed, I’d come across another item.
I went everywhere from typical document folders, into the Windows Registry, to removing any “Recents” from the Registry and from the physical folder location itself.
It’s amazing how many places various applications squirrel away bits of data.
It took me a few days, purging a couple of hours at a time.”
So let me get this straight – this guy is a genius ivolved in crypto who’s never heard of low-level HDD formatting, and so he goes on a few days “forensically” cleaning his PC of evidence by fumbling about in folders and Windows registry? He’s also never heard of forensic HDD recovery? Now give me a break.
Also, if, as he claims, all email prior May 2011 were “lost”, how can he recall the email conversations with CSW to such detail?

"Servers are not seized"
BTCe said they were seized.

Nice try Karpeles. The released report does not provide any evidence that the arrested guy was the actual Gox thief:
""To be clear, this investigation turned up evidence to identify Vinnik not as a hacker/thief but as a money launderer;""

What do you mean it may work? I've had my coins in iOS Mycelium for some time now. What's not to work there?

Both guys have "1967" on their T-shirts (the fat guy in blue arresting the thin guy in black). Coincidence?

Guys, he only got robbed for 130BTC - not a big deal. (his words).
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:25:52
That's not how the OP was phrased. Now it's clearer, thanks.
@_date: 2016-05-28 23:04:03
You're right. It's not like they even remotely exposed the personal and private financial info of the MtGox clients by publishing the list of creditors and their claims. Oh wait.
@_date: 2018-12-19 01:53:53
Nope. Just whales humping.

So you may want to change the title or update the OP until that happens? Or clickbait is clickbait you say?
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:21:18
No updates showing on the apple store. Are we safe?
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:24:29
Also, make sure the same applies for deposits - I deposited from my wife's account and they withheld the money for 4 straight days, causing me to miss out on the latest rally.
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:37:28
Where are those posts?
@_date: 2013-06-03 14:29:32
Can you maybe walk me through this a bit? What am I looking at when I click the address link?
I see the 1.9BTC is still in this address, right? Next, what am I looking at here?
and here?
Many thanks!

We all know how these company meetups go. Not much to do with work, a lot to do with vacation. It's not like you were coding in your hotel rooms in the evenings.

It's on Twitter so it MUST be true! To da Moon!!!
@_date: 2017-06-22 13:11:59
OP title slightly misleading - I assume you already do have a valid, running contract to get those utilities into your home? It's only an issue if you move?
Shitty story though, you have my sympathy!
@_date: 2017-06-17 21:16:14
Don't think BTC is in a good shape if this tired meme gets so many upvotes here.
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:52:30
He'll retort with something to the effect of "Dude you DON"T KNOW BTC mining is evil???"
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:38:17
Are you seriously using Twitter to tell a short story?
@_date: 2013-06-12 13:40:01
Hi I've sent you a PM, have you got it?
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:51:27
And what did you tell them?
@_date: 2013-07-31 19:44:23
Would having a bank account in the same Polish bank (I think it is Bank Zachodni?) help with the delays?
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:54:31
No, they are just really ignorant in this matter and I know there must be a way to prove them wrong, apart from teaching them programming and going through guiminer code line by line, looking for suspicious stuff. :)

@_date: 2013-06-03 18:14:27
What do you mean by "change"? The other movement (of more than 1.1BTC) seems to be a part of the same transaction as my "withdrawal"? It looks more like MTG sent 3BTC and split it between 2 different addresses within one transaction?
@_date: 2013-06-07 23:21:38
So these people are basically proving that some malware cannot be dected, how exactly? :)
@_date: 2013-06-03 11:28:21
Although yes I do realize this is a textbook case of user security error,  there's also a few things that make it peculiar:
1. This happaned exactly 24hrs after I deposited my first BTC funds ever into my Mtgox account... Coincidence? Maybe yes, maybe not and somebody was notified.
2. Any reason they left 0.05384082BTC on my MTG account? Why didn't they just take it all?
3. I'm not well-versed in the blackchain, but couldn't a possible trail be observed by looking at the offending address?
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:04:35
" you present someone with reasonable evidence that it's not a scam"
How can I do this? That's the only point of my original post... :)
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:36:59
Yes but how can you know that mining is the only thing the client does while utilizing 100% of your GPU? This guy claims that the client is doing evil things while also mining, and that those evil things are actually why so much computational power is needed, lol.
@_date: 2013-06-07 08:24:10
I've had my 1.9BTC stolen from MtGox earlier this week and now they are in the same address where the OP's 53BTC were withdrawn to:
There are also some other inputs in that address, anyone else recognize their stolen mtgox coins?
@_date: 2013-05-15 17:37:41
The protocol yes, but what about the various mining clients? Are they open-source too?
@_date: 2013-06-07 20:34:37
I'm sorry but for all your well-intended advise, this part is BS. 
If this were really the case, then any PC in the world, even in the corporate, would need to be assumed compromised by default, and there would be no trust whatsoever among individuals or corporations.
"Oh, you said you never knew of my trade secrets? Sorry, can't trust you, my machines (and yours too) are most likely compromised and the info was leaked to you."
I am all for security awareness (especially after I had my mtgox account compromised recently) but you are taking the paranoia too far- the onus to prove that a PC is infected is really on you. That is, if you so wish to base your (or anyones's) actions on this bold assertion.
@_date: 2013-05-15 13:46:59
I know but this is otherwise a nice and rational person with good grasp of computing/IT. It's just that he has (from who knows where) acquired this conspiratory notion of BTC and I feel there must be a simple way to disprove them?
Would "all mining clients are open-source" work, for instance? I mean, are they really?
@_date: 2013-06-04 10:13:36
Thanks, that explains it. Can you pleasse also explain what's happening with my BTC now?
I see he recently "emptied" the address and my 1.9BTC was sent, along with many others, to a sizeable wallet that now has 64BTC in it? Is this a mixing service?
