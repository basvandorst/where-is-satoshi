Amen. This right here is one of the biggest reasons I just don't bother getting into BTC yet. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 13:44:48
Why not make a new wallet and email just for this? Worst case you give out useless info best case you get btc?

What the everloving fuck is going on here? OP has virtually no post history, yet somehow attracted whining about post content, two anti-Trump comments, and only a couple comments about actual guns.
This is China Reddit. Fucking sad. Totally organic, great job guys.

Suppose aliens come down and plasma us back to the stone ages. What then?
Supposing is pointless. Fact is, I've watched the mental gymnastics used by real bitcoiners (not just people trying to make a darknet purchase) and fact is that it is basically unusable by any but the most dedicated and those who need to move large values of "wealth" to places banks don't like to play nice. 
All us normies see are the "tx fee was so high" and "I lost all my btc to theft".

It has been domain level banned by at least one nsfw sub that considers it sketchy for users to be paid for posting other people's content. Also it incentivizes spamming of links for revenue.  
  
I have personally seen pages upon pages of submitted nsfw posts across multiple subs from supload all with very low vote counts and 0 comments after 24 hours and by the same 2-3 users who are obviously not focused on posting quality over quantity.

What he did is not prohibited in the TOS. To compare it to stealing is misleading. He did something not explicitly prohibited and was banned without ever receiving a warning. Not the same at all. I'm sure if they had notified him that continued transactions outside of escrow would result in a ban he would have taken steps to not be banned, or at least stopped while he appealed the warning. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:56:06
Noone is forced to buy from him, it wasn't in the TOS, and they gave him no warning. Bad on them. Why would he hamstring himself unnecessarily if it wasn't breaking any rules that he knew of? We aren't discussing morality here, we are discussing being banned for breaking an invisible rule without warning.
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:09:06
If the rule was spelled out in the TOS this whole thread would be pointless. If a warning had been issued for violation of a nonexistent rule, then this whole thread would be pointless. Morality is wonderful but common sense rules are a dodgy way to prosecute someone. Just spell it out and nip the problem at its source.

Your argument regarding terms and conditions isn't very eloquent in either composition or content. It doesn't matter if ppl totes love t&amp;cs. It matters whether or not you followed the legally and socially accepted method for running a business. The company I work for has to be very thorough in their terms and conditions or else we would have no way to defend our actions when dealing with our users. If you are more than some schmuck selling handmade candles on etsy, and you deal with customers online, have a proper list of your terms and if necessary, update them. Arguing this is arguing how all businesses function online. Do it right or you will not have a leg to stand on when defending your actions other than "I do what I wanna and you can suck it."  
  
As to the other part, making your opinion known is one thing. Posting it over and over and over and over in reply to others THEN making a top level comment with it as well just comes across as smothering and unnecessary. Heck I only posted my opinion here a couple times and I felt like I overdid it.
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:54:27
Then just put it in the TOS and problem solved.

Lot of people in here who apparently go out of their way to follow unspoken rules in every walk of their lives and never ever ever try to benefit when the rules don't keep them from doing so. I bet they drop a fiver in the dish after using the hand towel and taking a mint whenever they use the bathroom in a restaurant too 100% of the time.  
  
You didn't break a single rule and received no warning, so the ban is not justified. Simple.
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:06:21
You're quite the comment jockey in this thread. It's good to be passionate about things, though. In the end, just put the rule in the TOS and the argument becomes moot. Bans without warning for violating a nonexistent rule are dodgy. If common sense rules were enforceable then I could make citizens arrests all day long and put everyone in miami in prison.

Nope just a factual let's call it where there's smoke there's fire subreddit. Definitely not a DNC apologist subreddit.

No more or less so than ever before, or than we do in every other country and their elections. But no I do not think, and in fact I am sure beyond doubt, that Russia is not why Trump is President.
That can be squarely laid on the shoulders of the DNC and their abhorrent candidate Hillary Clinton.

I don't really care one way or the other, but it's a common thing for people to see the largest discussion forum on a topic as having become a sort of "open" resource. They, like most of reddit, fail to remember they can go make another sub and convince people to leave this one.  
  
Unfortunately it's top-mod-takes-all even with single-word familiar terms like funny, bitcoin, and trees. Even when they fail to properly handle those subs according to public opinion.
