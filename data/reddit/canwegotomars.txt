don't think about it on a per transaction.  think about it across the full market: if at a given price there are more buyers than sellers, the price will go up in order to find more sellers to match the buyers.
@_date: 2019-07-17 13:10:56
Yea but if at any given point in the month, the price hits the predicted price for that month, that's still ridiculously awesome.

It’s just the title of the article, nbd.

Agreed, it’s poor wording, but the graph is still comparing apples to apples. Market cap to market cap.

Came in to to say this.  You're right, only a small percentage of gold's price is based off it's intrinsic value.

Tom Lee predicted the post tax day rally as well, and is a very respected research analyst on Wall St.  The dude knows his stuff
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:44:15
Haha.  You're right, he can't predict the future.  That goes without saying.  He's not perfect, no one is.  But remember, also, he's bullish because he structures his research around multi-decade trends.  That should give you perspective on why he was a buyer back in December.

Central banks can cause collapses, but are by no means the only cause. They exist regardless of the structure of the governing authority, and are as old as time. In that sense, I do not agree that central banks are the major contributor to collapses. It fundamental component to our human nature to overreact, both to the positive and negative side. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 15:34:39
Although I'm huge proponent for BTC and digital currencies, that doesn't mean I'm necessarily against the current monetary system.  Capitalism and capital markets, as governed by the Central Banking Authorities, have lead to an incredible advances to civilization.  We live in literally the best time ever to be alive.  And life is orders of magnitude better than just a century or two ago.  Credit where credit is due. 
@_date: 2019-03-18 19:10:17
I actually largely agree with your quote.   Booms and busts are rooted in human nature, and will always be inevitable regardless of Central Banks.  Additionally, yes, they can be the cause as well.  They're human too.  My point is that it's unfair to constantly fixate on the terribly one directional view that central banks have failed us.  There are problems, yes.  Things can get better, yes.  But sometimes the overtly harsh criticisms of the our current system come off as a little ridiculous, considering unbelievable progress humanity has made.  The system has worked pretty well over the last century.

Are you compiling the data for this?  Where can we find historical volumes for BAKKT?  I can only find current daily data.

bitcoin market is essentially the same as gold.  you could hypothesize a scenario for precious metals that is very similar to the one you worried about for bitcoin.  gold has survived for thousands of years.

Meh, i wouldn't necessarily agree with your first sentence.  I thinking BTC could definitely exist with a 21 trillion dollar market  cap in a economy that is largely the same to today.  That's a big number, but it would still be right in line with the market caps of many other currently existing asset classes.

There are two standard forms of measure for inflation: the consumer price index (CPI) and the producer price index (PPI).  Both track prices for a basket of goods accross the economy.

The fed CAN fix this, through monetary tightening, which they’ve been doing for a couple of years. Basically, they are doing two things: 1 - they are raising interest rates, which makes it more expensive to borrow ( so the price of money is rising). 2. They are beginning to unwind their multi-trillion dollar balance sheet that grew as a result of quantitative easing. 
Quantitative easing was the program that increased the supply of USD, “printing money”, by injecting billions per month into the economy through asset purchasing programs. They would buy US government bonds from the economy with newly created cash.  Now they can do the opposite - they can sell the bonds on their balance sheet to suck cash out of the system.

Whether or not the bill is still usable is a moot point.  It's still vandalism, and I agree this is a stupid thing to do.

A bit dramatic, I’d say

The fed comes in a huge buyer of overnight repos, which raises prices (lowers interest rates) in the overnight market.   Overnight rates were spiking and the fed wanted to lower them.

TARP was repaid by the banks to the government plus interest, which is an INTERNALIZED cost, not an externality.  The U.S. Treasury, and therefor the tax payer, literally made money on the bailout.  Don't worry, you you're not paying a dime for the financial bailout.

Let's say it takes 5 more years to get an ETF approved.  You think USD might be irrelevant by then?  There's almost a 0% chance of that coming true.

The problem with the “blame the banks” bullshit, is that it’s normally expressed as a singular point of view, choosing to highlight the imperfections of the capital markets, without acknowledging the overwhelmingly positive impact banking has had on society. If you live in a developed country, literally EVERYTHING that you encounter is a result of the banking economy. The food you eat, the goods you consume, the technology you rely on, are from businesses that almost certainly exist ONLY because they have been able to take advantage of and rely upon the access to capital through the form of debt. Banks are the way we redistribute capital FROM those who have more than they need TO those who need more than they have. Creditors and Debtors.

Multiple comments that the days of explosive growth should/could be over.  Personally, I doubt that.  BTC will achieve stability once the market has matured.  I think we are at least two orders of magnitude away from those days. Until then, I’d expect another bubble, maybe multiple bubbles.
