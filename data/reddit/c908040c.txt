Everyone's in it to make money in terms of fiat. Despite what you post here, you, too, are here to make money in terms of fiat. Very, very, very few people actually understand the purpose of bitcoin and is in it for the ideology of bitcoin and the global change btc hopes to make in future years. That's why this has so many post about price in terms of fiat.

You could do that with stocks. To you and people like you, bitcoin is just another "stock".

Bitcoin shitcoin is going down and taking along with it so many gullible people. :( It's so funny. Ha ha ha ha. It hurts so much. I want my mommy.

So much shirting around the actual lesson learn-- crypto is just a neck-beard thing. It ain't replacing global fiat any time soon. If ever. Crypto is incredibly hard to use. That's even if you can use it in the first place at all. Not like cash or credit card or even shit like PayPal. Super easy to use.

This thread is one reason why bitcoin won't go mainstream. Too much technical knowledge is required to keep, store, use bitcoin. Cash and card are easy. The trust already exists between people and visa and usg etc.

Internet got easier. There was nothing to "store". With bitcoin, you have to know how to store your bitcoin. If you don't know wtf you are doing, you can really end up losing most if not all of your btc. If you are using custodial third party, then what's the point of bitcoin? Might as well stick with Paypal and Moneygram.

With all these ups and downs and shorts and stop-loss and limit-by, how the fuck is shitcoin-bitcoin not just another stock? A stock without a physical company or actually product behind it. It feels like a massive ponzi scheme with a made up fake stock. Don't get me wrong. I'm not shilling something else. If bitcoin is shit, then every other crypto coins are shit X 100000000000. 
A lot of people are going to lose a lot of money through bitcoin/crypto. Sucks for them. 
/it hurts so much to admit this

I'll be quite okay losing $50 or so dollars of bitcoin I bought few years ago. Not that desperate.

Think for a second why someone would 'westernize' their name? Its mostly to blend in and prosper. Your name is one of your most important and primary identity. If you are willing to hide that for self-benefit, then you are going to say anything for self-enrichment. I can't trust someone who does this.  His name is Saif al-Din. Not saifedean. He or his family changed it and now he's not trust worthy. Beside he's got huge conflict of interest.

Bitcoin is currency. It's entirely possible to commit fraud with bitcoin just as it is possible to commit fraud with fiat. You libertarian young fuckers are very clueless about economy and banking and finance. Bunch of idealistic morons hoping to get rich quick through cryptos. You'll get burned. Only come out ahead if you, as the imbeciles says, *hodl*.

As an hodler, I okay with this kind of prediction. Nothing to outrageous. I have nothing but to gain if it goes to $60K or more.

Someone who spells their name like this doesn't seem all that trust worthy. It should be spelled Saif Al Deen = Sword of the Religion (usually Islam but sometimes Christianity).

Yeah. Fee will go up when there's more transactions in the mempool. Mempool will go up if bitcoin becomes as famous as it was second half of 2016. Segwit and LN will help but there will always be fees. Maybe more as block reward goes down each passing 4 years.

Bitcoin is an actually things and it has intrinsic value. So not at all like MLM. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:56:04
Yeah. This is good. The ico crap took some of the steam out of bitcoin..Now they can't anymore at least through advertising on these big ad networks.

They do but digital banking caught on faster and there's this entire generation of people who never used check. 
This is sort of like how 3rd world adopted mobile phone lumber crazy. Cell phone requires less infrastucture than landlines. Mobile banking requires less "infrastucture" than retail banking so to speak.

Don't tell people how much btc you have or how much you transacted with.

Why? Bitcoin, LN are more than one person or persons, or culture or country. Stop making cult personality out of bitcoin users or even creator. In that sense fuck Satoshi fuck roger ver fuck jihan fuck crigh fuck bitconnect guys fuck antonopos or whatever his name is. Bitcoin isn't a religious..It's a tool, a currency, store of value not belonging to anyone but to whole humanity.

If it goes to $4500, I lick my wife's pussy so she will let me sell her ring so I can buy some bitcoin.

That's one of the reason why bitcoin or any other rigidly deflationary currency won't ever replace Fiat currency. Look at gold. It has been with human society gor thousands of years. Still couldn't replace or stand up to Fiat. Bitcoin will be same. It will continue to exist along side fiat but never surpass fiat

It's wrong to call the funding bill of a nation to be unnecessary. How the hell is the coutry supposed to run without funding/spending?
Even if bitcoin replaces USD, goverment still has to be funded and goverment needs to spend to keep working. There's hardly any unnecessary expense in the bill. Sime line item on their own looks out of place and out of sync but of you look into the background of why those items were created in the first place and understand why it's necessary you wouldn't call it stupid anymore.
Song the hymn of bitcoin all you want. I do too. But don't tie goverment spending with success of it.

I love analyst luke this. They are creating hype and positive momentum. All these positive news add to the overall mood about bitcoin. It's a self fulfilling prophecy type thing. Keep providing these analysis. Most of them base it on something tangible. So it's not just pump and dump.

Blockchain is a very shitty database. Blockchain only works when its bitcoin. Here me out: Let's say you want to store property deed on blockchain. But who's going to add to the blockchain? Who's gonna mine that blockchain? And why would they? What reward is there? Blockchain only works in context of bitcoin. Bitcoin works only on context of bitcoin. So we are living bitcoin world. Not blockchain world.

They are all bullshit ponzi scheme. You can't morally tell people to buy into this ponzi things. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency. Rest are ponzi scheme a clever website and marketing then team. Eth is the only other cryptocurrency that has actual usecases.
