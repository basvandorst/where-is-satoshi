Why can't we just use SI prefixes? It would be easier to understand that BTC and µBTC aren't two distinct currencies. Bits sounds like yet another altcoin and has enough different meanings already.

That's false. You pay a flat fee per transaction size in vbyte. It doesn't matter if you are sending 0.01BTC or 10BTC. If both transactions have the same amount and types of inputs and outputs then they should cost the same amount for the same confirmation target.

Interesting, I just [looked up the peers of my node]( and there are only 3 unlimited nodes (out of 123 nodes). Thats about 2.4%. Given the [coin.dance node data]( I'd expect about 12% of my peers to be Unlimited nodes. The probability for this to happen is less than 0.01% (using hypergeometric distribution, 5709 nodes and 692 Unlimited nodes).
Do 0.13.* bitcoind nodes prefer other 0.13.* nodes because they support compact blocks (heard something like that iirc)? That could be a possible cause of this imbalance.

That's a nice property of the SegWit soft fork:
* if you care about low fees: upgrade your software
* if you don't mind paying higher fees: just keep everything as is, you are not forced to upgrade

He provided cryptographic proof that the email was actually sent using *outlook.com* and that outlook claims that the mail was sent by *soupernerd You can easily verify the DKIM signature using opendkim (assuming you saved the paste to *soupernerd.eml*):
    opendkim -t soupernerd.eml
So, if you trust outlook to not send a spoofed email to you have quite good proof that sent the email himself (there is much evidence that he used this email address).

ptodd just linked to a publicly known bug, that's totally in line with the NAP. MP said some crazy stuff ([in regards to Pieter Wuille]( and thus I have reservations towards him, but he is no threat to the network. Blockstream is just sponsoring some development of nice features like LN and SegWit, it's up to us users to accept them. 
What's your point? I'd say in the long run it's best if the bitcoin community is divided in many small splinter groups blocking each other, this will protect the protocol from being changed.

That's a big if. I know many, myself included, who want to avoid hard forks by all means. If you want more capacity try to get consensus for SegWit or extension blocks. A hard fork will mean war.

ACK, everyone will agree on changing the signature algorithm once the threat of quantum computers becomes apparent to the majority. 
The bigger problem will be a technical one: afaik all post quantum signature systems (based on hashes) have much larger keys/signatures than ECDSA. For example SPHINCS[1] (which is one of the algorithms with reasonable small sizes) has 41KByte signatures. So I hope that we will have some second layer solution like LN that really scales till then.

I don't think Lamport Signatures alone would be feasible as BTC's signature algorithm because you can only sign one message otherwise you would enable forgeries.
But if you use algorithms that build on top of Lamport Signatures you can achieve stateless many-time signatures. Sphincs for example uses Lamport Signatures, but in a way that enables you to use the same keypair multiple times (edit:)without the need to remember the state of your key (

At the moment the algorithms for post quantum signing have the problem of a) having large keys or b) having large signatures. 
As I wrote somewhere else on reddit:






@_date: 2017-03-07 22:08:32
Back when "Bitcoin Classic" was a thing SegWit was thought of as a compromise because it raises the effective throughput to ~1.7MB/block without needing a hard fork. 
For me it is still a compromise: I don't want a block size increase (not important for my use cases) but would be ok with a throughput increase via soft fork(s). SegWit has the benefit of fixing the malleability issue, so it seems a logical first step. After that signature aggregation and extension blocks might follow.
All I ask for is to make these changes optional, which means backwards compatible.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:34:31
First: I think this guardtime website is full of marketing bs. 
Nonetheless there is some truth in it: cryptography used in most of the crypto currencies I know of (mainly ECDSA) is vulnerable to quantum computer attacks. The solution are post QC signing algorithms based on hashing algorithms.
The problem is afaik that they use significantly larger signatures and/or keys (~40kb per sig using sphinx which is one of the most size efficient algorithms out there at the moment). So right now that wouldn't be an option (&lt;25 tx per block :D ).
But when the time comes that QCs are actually able to crack today's crypto we will have the option to use these new algorithms.

That's an impressive figure :) I only routed 1/100th of that so far, let's see if that gets more after opening a channel to you.
But to everyone who thinks they are generating significant income from fees: 
They made ~434 sat in fees during the last 10 days (given 1sat/1Msat routed + 1msat base fee advertised on their website) with a capital investment of ~3.2BTC max. (more likely 1.6BTC if channels are balanced) given the stats from 1ml. That translates to ~0.01-0.005% apr :/ doesn't sound like a good deal unless they can sell people incoming capacity.

These OP-Codes [0] were intended for "reinterpretation". That's not a hack, it's a feature and is called [forward compatibility](

That's a problem for sure, but I can't see any good solution other than letting the market figure it out (once the mining hardware stops improving that rapidly people will begin to mine again, I'd even do this at a small loss).


Then bitcoin does not fit your needs, feel free to leave. I'm happy you don't have control over bitcoin, nobody has, not even the miners. They could start minig &gt;1mb blocks today and my nodes would happily ignore them.

In theory that's only a problem for people that use the new feature. If only my hot coins (for everyday payments) were on the  MW-extension blocks then I don't think my risk profile changes that much. For long term cold storage one can always go back to the non-inflatable part.
The main problem might be the reputational risk and the market reactions in case of a failure of the MW exension.

Currently the only way to interact with liquid is through `liquid-cli`, so there is no GUI available yet. I guess that explains the low usage (and that many exchanges still have to integrate it).
I already played around with it and issued an asset, works pretty well. You only have to be careful that you don't claim your pegged in coins before they are mature (~102 confirmations) otherwise it will take a bit longer since nodes might get confused.
If anybody wants a test asset to play around with and some satoshi of LBTC to pay the transaction fees with just send me a liquid address and I'll send you some :) (you can get liquid [here]( running it is similar to running bitcoind)

First of all, it does not seem necessary.  SegWit isn't utilized that much, which means people value not upgrading more than lower fees. If you want lower fees use a wallet that supports SegWit.
Since there is no clear consensus for a HF blocksize increase it will be just another split like BCH (and an even bigger mess due to missing replay protection). Furthermore the sw2x was discussed and decided privately between some market participants without community input, that alone is a big red flag.

I will only ever implement the pub key upload variant. Giving people private keys you generated is asking for trouble since they might add them permanently and accidentally use them for other servers too.

I think the problem is that it's not directly a cost, but just an investment with guaranteed ROI if you are a miner. IMO it's possible to "invest" 101% of the current stake into taking it over and getting ~200% (investment + previous stake) out of the attack
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:11:40
Looks pretty interesting if it works, I don't fully understand how you get coins onto or off of the sidechain. The document states that staking funds doesn't give you sidechain coins and that you can do atomic swaps instead, but where are the sidechain coins coming from that you use for these atomic swaps?
Regarding the game theory: can't an attacker (if they are a miner) become 51% of the stakers and then just steal their stake by creating a slash transaction and including it in the next block mined by them? Once they have &gt;50% there seems to be no risk to the attacker.

Current bitcoin clients won't follow a invalid (e.g. &gt;1MB blocks) chain even if it had more hashing power. This stubbornness and inertia is a good defence against miners hardforking (e.g. to raise the block-size limit).
BU on the other hand would follow the longest chain if it has significantly (user-defined) more hashing power (even if it is violating it's own user-defined max-block-size). Thus miners could push the block size further and further as they have always done. I don't have faith in the miners preserving bitcoin's decentralization, they are just here for the money and since decentralization is hard to measure the market would probably only react when it's already too late.

That's not true. SegWit transactions will look like regular anyone-can-spend transactions to old nodes. I see no potential problems for these old nodes processing and accepting such transactions (at least as long as you wait for some confirmations [1]). So nobody is forced to upgrade, it's only necessary if you want to use SegWit's benefits (that's the definition of backwards compatibility [2]). 
[1] That's what you should be doing anyway, since 0-conf transactions are not intended to be secure

(1) So basically you help someone for your own gain out of free will (with other people's money, that alone makes it immoral for me).


(2) After you saved him, you proclaim that his life is your's now because you helped him.


(3) And finally you kill him.
As long as the one you helped didn't sign a contract that states the consequences of (1) will be (3), that sounds immoral. I can't imagine any bank signed a contract that will allow the state to break it up.

It's not wrong per se, but it's quite inefficient. Bitcoin is a flooding network, everyone has to process these coffee transactions. To enable all [1] people to participate in the network we need to restrict the maximum traffic requirements (currently 1MB hard cap, may change in future if safe enough). That leads to a fee market where your coffee transaction has to compete with higher value transactions for the bandwidth of the bitcoin network. Right now there are many transactions that produce much more economic value for their issuers than your coffee transactions, that's why they are being priced out.
Of course you can pay 0.30$ for a transaction that only sends the 3.50$ for your morning coffee, but it would be a bit silly. Do you really need the trustlessness and censorship-resistance for your coffee purchase? I don't think so, but that doesn't even matter. What matters is, that the market has found the value of a bitcoin transaction and you may pay that much and use the network for whatever you want, or not. Bitcoin doesn't care.
[1] I'm not shure how to define 'all', but it should probably include users with mobile phones

Maybe they can't produce enough economic incentive for anyone to bother (as tragic as this is). If your only savings are ten to hundred bucks you can keep them in your pocket just fine, why waste money on storing them? If you have more bitcoin becomes attractive again even with 1$ fees (if you don't mind the involved risks).

If you have a powerful raspberry pi you can use [spruned]( as a "SPV" drop in replacement for bitcoind (be aware of the trust model). I use it together with [c-lightning]( on a Raspberry Pi 3B+.
Another option is to use [lnd]( with the neutrino back end (it just connects to the p2p network like spruned). But the last time I looked this was only enabled for testnet. But if you are reckless you can just comment out the if statement that forbids the use on mainnet ;) (and you'll probably have to run your own btcd full node somewhere else with neutrino activated, too).
And you can build [pretty sweet things]( with a Pi and Lightning ;)

If you are a technical user, understand the risks [1] and are comfortable with using a cli you can play around with it today [2]! The GreenAddress team is also working on a Liquid GUI wallet.
If you are aware of the trust model of Liquid and are ok with it then you can utilize it's advanced features that aren't yet or maybe will never be part of Bitcoin. Some example are confidential transactions [3] and asset issuance (e.g. exchanges could issue fiat coins). Furthermore Liquid has fixed and much shorter (1 min.) block times [4] since the set of consensus critical nodes is fixed and the network performance for these is quite predictable. This means that, due to the consensus/trust model that doesn't allow forks/orphans/etc., your transactions are final after 2 minutes (2 Blocks) instead of a purely random time it takes to mine n (typically 3 or 6, depending on security requirements) Bitcoin blocks.
[1] Peg-outs are only possible through exchanges, I don't know if that should change in the future.

What capabilities are you talking about? The ServiceFlags seem to announce all relevant information about a node.

I interpret it as "in a perfect market miner's expenses should equal their income", because as soon as there is some profit to make more people will mine. 
Unfortunately the mining market isn't perfect. E.g. production of mining equipment is highly centralized (and because you need special hardware to mine). That's why there is still profit to be made and why you could see this as a bug.

You just can't coordinate a truly decentralized network. If you want as many people to upgrade you have to wait for at least 6 months or better more than one year. Keep in mind that not everybody is as involved in this whole drama.


It will only take years if people don't mind to pay high fees, but then it is ok.
