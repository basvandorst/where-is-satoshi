God said to Abraham: "through your offspring all nations on earth will be blessed" (this is historically documented before the rise of Christianity and Islam). He had two sons: Isaac and Ishmael. Isaac is the ancestor of Jesus, the founder of Christianity and Ishmael is the ancestor of Muslims. Vast majority of world's population (according to current trends) will be either Christian or Muslim over the next few decades. Do you know not find that interesting?

We need the limits and constraints to force resourceful scaling measures. If fees were still low, there would be no push for exchanges to adopt segwit or batch processing.

This looks like it's evaluating the currency based on how much cash is available. I don't believe that's the right calculation. It should include all bank deposits as well, which would put Bitcoin much further down the list.

The nodes that are providing the hashing power that keeps the network secure. 
I'm not an expert technically, but I believe the number of nodes can just as easily be centralized (as hashpower currently is) by just starting up a number of VMs. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 16:39:24
Reasons for: 
- lower fees
- segwit activation was a compromise among major stakeholders; not fulfilling 2nd part of the agreement sets a bad precedence and makes future agreements much less likely
- many (maybe majority of) users are for it (unfortunately, not typically the vocal ones)
- will allow room for bitcoin to scale for the next couple years ($2-3 fees seems a lot more reasonable to load your LN wallet, then $10-20)
- as much as people on this sub dislike miners and exchanges, they are a very important part of the ecosystem
- avoid a contentious hard fork where potentially the chain that is considered "bitcoin" is not the one with majority hashpower 
- most agree we will have to increase blocksize at some point, why not just do it now? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 21:33:05
I'd prefer keeping the 1MB block as well, but I do hope we prevent another fork, especially one where the majority hashpower might fork from the consensus version of the users (not sure what would happen in that case). 
What do you think a good indicator of needing to increase the blocksize might be? 
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:13:17
(2) A lot of important companies in the Bitcoin space and most miners did agree though, and I think a lot of the user base (though not the vocal ones it seems) were satisfied with the compromise. Ultimately, it's one of the reasons that helped get segwit activated, along with the threat of UASF and the emergence of a competitor in Ethereum.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:20:20
However, the "behind close doors" decision did help get segwit activated. The code was definitely rushed and I wish core devs were involved, but the new code was rushed to production anyways and is being used now. Ideological differences on the direction may lead to further splits down the road, but I think it's the fork that has the most "buy-in" from institutions and users, not just users that will have the most value and win out. I don't think "buy-in" from institutions necessarily means corporate takeover or loss of decentralization. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:30:10
I think it's reasonable. Though, we do need the Lightning Network to be implemented before Bitcoin becomes primarily a settlement layer.
Eventually, in a couple decades, the block reward will no longer provide enough incentive for minors to keep the network secure. In the long run, we are going to need much higher transaction fees (I'm guessing somewhere in the neighborhood of wire transfer fees) to keep the network robust and secure, and provide enough incentive for a large number of miners. 
  
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:40:41
Agreed. We need to look at the long-term end game, which is not miners making a measly $.10 per transaction to keep a trillion dollar asset class afloat. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 21:17:59
One possible solution is just stream money, so send money in "packets" since transaction fees are negligible. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 21:19:32
1MB blocksize ~ 7 tps
20MB blocksize ~ 140 tps
Even with large blocksizes, we need to come to the realization that the blockchain will just be the settlement layer with much larger transaction fees. Miners making $0.10 on 100 tps will not sustain a globally used, decentralized monetary system. I don't see any reason to panic if we see much higher transaction fees (&gt;$1).

@_date: 2017-11-03 04:09:58
Maybe the demand to be long Bitcoin by investors will cause future settlement prices to be high, which may cause traders to make money by shorting the futures (due to the high settlement price) and hedging that position by going long the underlying (buying actual Bitcoin)

It's either going to a revolutionary store of wealth and payment technology (and will be worth a lot more), or it's not. For payment technology, if you haven't already yet, I'd read up the potential of the Lightning Network to serve this purpose.

I think Xapo will handle it in a proper manner. It sounds like you will get access to both coins after the fork, just like Coinbase intends to handle it. I'm not sure about the timing though. I think you will get access to your new coins shortly after the fork on Coinbase. There may be more of a delay on Xapo.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:37:16
The technology wasn't there before for mass usage adoption. The Lightning Network will allow for cheap and nearly instantaneous transactions, which I believe will lead to actual usage.

Highest expected value strategy for an asset that is going up in the long run is to buy as soon as possible.
But that is risky, so dollar cost averaging will lower expected value, but will mitigate the downside risk (like insurance)
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:33:53
Not an expert, but I believe if people are mostly bullish then they will go long (buy) futures which will cause the futures price to have a premium over the underlying Bitcoin price. This will lead to traders taking advantage of arbitrage by shorting the futures (narrowing the arbitrage opportunity), and buying Bitcoin to hedge their position, which will drive up the price of Bitcoin.
If traders are mostly bearish (and sell futures), then it will have the opposite effect. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:45:14
That's not true. Coinbase will issue S2X coins to holders of BTC before the fork.

I don't have a strong ideologically point of view on this. Obviously, a lot of people on this sub do.

If you think Bitcoin will be a revolutionary technology that will eventually be mass adopted, then just wait it out. It's mathematically in your favor not to time the market (if you think it will go up in the long run) and to just hold it. Think of it like buying Microsoft stock in the 80s.

Lightning network will make everyday usage possible. Transferring BTC to a Lightning Wallet may take 10min or more, but will be instantaneous once it's there to make trips to the grocery store or direct online purchases. BTC wallet will be like a savings account and lightning wallet more like your everyday cash wallet.

Yeah, I think there will be some interesting applications on the 2nd layer - some of which we haven't even thought of. 
It's likely adoption of the 2nd layer will be online first (through browser wallets / APIs), and then retail transactions after that.

@_date: 2017-07-28 03:54:58
You're supposed to get both coins, but from Coinbase's statement, it doesn't sound like they will support both. They will only the hold the coin from the main fork for you. If you want both, best thing would be for you to transfer coins out. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 05:17:13
Great points. Especially with the mainstream adoption of bitcoin around the corner, it will be increasingly necessary for the exchanges to act as responsible custodians.  
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:06:17
Not really sure how this will play out, but perhaps the value of the main coin will drop immediately after it forks in the amount of the value of the forked coin (whose futures is trading at around $350). In that case, there wouldn't be a difference in your total value right after the fork. Sort of like what happens when a company pays a large dividend. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:30:30
That's true. That may be a more prudent approach for CB. 
I'm just thinking of their user base, which is increasingly mainstream and not familiar with the basics of securing their own bitcoin. It may be more work for CB to handle this, but it would definitely help their customers. I thought Kraken's strategy seemed like a good approach. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:13:37
The value of customer holdings on Aug 1st will be BTC + BCC. I think there may be legal implications if Coinbase doesn't at least cash out the BCC and credit their customers in fiat. (I'm not sure if they were intending to keep that value for themselves). 
They don't have to support BCC, but they should at least sell it on an exchange and provide that value for their customers. Otherwise, I think there may be grounds for a class action lawsuit (it's significant as it could be over 10% of their total holdings)
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:24:27
It's sort of unchartered territory, but if you think of bitcoin like a security, then I don't think it's that different than something like a stock split, where the owner is entitled to new shares. I don't think people just coming up with their own altcoin is too much of an issue, because it only matters if it has significant market value. 
Also, I agree the exchanges don't necessarily have to support it, but they do need to acknowledge that they will handle the value creation in a fair and appropriate way. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:24:01
If they don't support Bitcoin Cash, they need to at least cash it out for their customers. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:58:25
I've been a customer for over 4 years, and have not had an unfavorable view of the company like many on this sub. They haven't emailed me regarding the information in their blog post. The only reason I know is because I checked reddit today. 
I don't think it's a reasonable timeline also to withdraw coins, especially because I'm having technical issues in withdrawing. I'm not here to FUD on CB--they are a decent and well run company. But they are, I believe, making a mistake not at least cashing out on forked coins that they don't support for their customers. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 04:03:25
I guess the whole situation is not "reasonable". But if we had to put the burden on either the mainstream user or Coinbase to deal with the situation, I think it's better that Coinbase handles it, as they are experts in cryptocurrency. I don't think it's best to put the burden on the user--especially, ones with limited knowledge and experience--to hastily move their coins to another storage method, which may or may not be secure. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:08:55
Honestly, until a few days ago, I thought BCC would not hold any value, so I didn't think much of the implications. But it looks like it could trade at 10-15% of bitcoin's value. I don't think it's unreasonable for CB to at least cash out any major alt-coin forks, especially for their customers who would no idea how to handle this.
