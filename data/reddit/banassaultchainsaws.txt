@_date: 2018-05-01 14:02:18
You are a victim of "unfortunate" events. It seems you were phished, hacked, and stolen at a time that binance experienced a "API" hack. The Api hack was people that signed up on a website that "traded" your crypto for you, and it traded those peoples crypto into a coin the hackers had high sell orders in. Pretty genius if you ask me. They didn't steal from anyone's account, just manipulated it to legit sells at higher prices on a coin they controlled. 
Anyways, In binance term agreement, it specifically says they are not responsible for hacking or phishing attempts on your end. That is a good thing. If all I had to do was give my password to a friend, and have him "hack and steal" all my crypto, then ask binance to cover me, we would all be rich. 
You should take your security more seriously next time. You need to enable 2 Factor Authentication on all accounts. Even go as far as lock accounts.
If you left crypto on an exchange after a hiatus, that is a hard lesson for you. Sorry for your loss bud.

Jobs will not be harder and harder to find in a decade..... Just like the world will not be destroyed in 12 years like the fear mongering politicians want you to think.

It is sad really. I wish politicians would stick to what they know, blowing smoke up peoples asses. That goes for both sides.

UBI ONLY works with current economics, if not, you have no extra money to give away... You people keep forgetting that. The only way your system works is by TAKING away people's money who earned it and giving it to people that "should have earned it" with no labor or risk.

@_date: 2019-03-04 17:56:45
Honestly, I respond with hostility because the ideas of communism lead to death and genocide, historically, and currently (see: Venezuela) so they must be met with equal response. In response to you, I will try to be more respectful as you are trying to understand not so much institute these ideas. 
So to answer your questions, the idea that "jobs are disappearing" is a lie that is peddled by communists to make you think their solution to the problem is the key. The reality IS we are an ever evolving population with jobs and intelligence. Survival of the fittest IS the only way. As much as we try to be better than nature we are always brought back to the realization that we are governed by a set of rules that are ingrained in our evolution. So, if there are a group of people that were cranberry pickers, but now there is a machine that does the work of 100 workers, those 100 workers need to either go to the blueberry fields(which isn't ideal because the inventor is changing the cranberry machine to do blueberries next), OR go to school and learn to either work on, build, or fix the cranberry machine. It is that simple. The idea that "current occupations are disappearing at an astonishing rate" is in fact true when looked through a telescope, but when looking at the big picture, there are more jobs created with higher skills, and higher pay. It is up to the worker to adapt with the changes. Hence where the "supply and demand"  comes from. This has nothing to do with a "left/right" paradigm as you mentioned before. 
Lastly I will say, I have two engineering degrees, mechanical and electrical with a Masters in electrical. I went to school with friends that were mastering in things like "French" and "history." I still talk with these people, and they aren't doing too well. They chose paths that led to a dead end. Instead of going back to school or a trade school they choose to blame society and everyone else but themselves and make themselves out to be the victim. Not that my path was prosperous or the right one, a lot has changed in the engineering world in the past 20 years(since I graduated) and I have to adapt, take courses and certs to stay current in my field. I can lay down, take my UBI payments, and blame everyone but myself, or I can invest in myself and adapt to the change in the tides. 
I hope this helps with your quest in finding the right answer. Hopefully, I was respectful enough this go-round.
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:04:49
Unfortunately you don't understand economics. The difference is economics are real, UBi fake and unsustainable.....
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:52:18
I don't have to change my thinking. UBi gives incentive without a product or service in return. The response you said was well thought out stated it offsets jobs lost to robots and automation. Do you know how many jobs automation has created? It is not only higher skilled, but higher pay. You are proposing giving incentive to someone not educating themselves and bettering themselves to seek these higher skilled jobs. In turn, stalling innovation and improved life for more people. It now not only seems you are the paid shill, but may be the same person as toshiboy. If you are truly 90 years old, you are the dumbest 90 year old and learned nothing in watching all those communist countries fall AND genocide their population.... Good luck. Maybe take a few advanced economics classes before preposing such a shit idea. Let me know if you need anymore knowledge. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 03:41:51
You need to test your wonderful economic theory. I bet you don't get far. You are long winded and not that willing to realize basic facts. If you said UBi = government backed incentive programs that subsidized low paying jobs... I MIGHT agree with you, but the problem with that is eventually you run out of free government money and sky rocket inflation. There is no free lunch. Please try self sustained living for a bit and realize how hard it really is just to live. 
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:48:12
Says the guy with a low end job thinking the answer for increasing the demand of your labor is too demand more money from the government and get corporations to pay for it. That sounds like a fool proof plan. I have seen all the arguments on UBi. If you haven't changed your mind, I'm not the problem here.

I do believe our system needs work, doesn't mean we replace it with one that not only won't work but depends on other people's money and the success of the current system to even be feasible. I created millions of dollars out of thin air with Bitcoin. I'm not mad. You are. Hence why you want people with guns to take money from someone who earned it and give to those who don't. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 03:38:12
You not only don't understand life, but are not smart enough to articulate what you are proposing. LIVING requires work to feed yourself. Let's say you live in the middle of the woods, no government to spoon feed you. What happens if you dont work 9-5 to raise animals, grow crops, and tend to your living area??? You die. So, grow up, learn to be an adult, and go to work to feed yourself and your family. Or stick to Darwinism and die off. Please. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 18:48:28
No..  I am well aware of the genocide and people being pushed out of planes. But my point was strictly capitalism causing this. The reality is, all governments are bad. You are asking for MORE GOVERNMENT power and dependency. You should know that all power and control ends in war and genocide. Freedom is the only way. Liberty of the individual. Say what you want, bankers are bad whatever, but American is the closest you get to that. Then you have people like your boss, Yang, trying to mess it up to..... Create more genocide. NE ways. Hope you have a good life. And btw, I'm talking about fighting this when you and your people try to come take our guns. We aren't Argentina. We will fight. And please tell me how we "can't fight tanks and missiles." That will be fun.

Ahhhhhhhhhhh the 'ol "thousands of experts" argument...  Why don't you post the recent "expert" reviews of UBi tthat got it ended because it didn't help and wasn't sustainable. Can't handle the truth of those experts huh?
@_date: 2019-03-17 17:03:03
Good job, it is so easy to make straw man arguments when the last point made is correct. If you want to debate "climate change," you should go over to r/politics. This is r/Bitcoin where we speak in reality. If you believe in climate change, you probably drank the koolaid that bitcoin uses "too much energy." It is easy to fool people with the "experts agree" argument because, you yourself, are not an expert. So you have to believe it.... 
BACK TO THE POINT- UBI is unsustainable and provides zero supply to a system of demand. I would agree with the system MAYBE if it was a hourly subsidy that was given out for hours worked. So, the government gives $4 an hour more to people that only make $11 an hour in an area that requires $15 an hour to live. Giving everyone across the board $1000 a month in places like Alabama is MORE THAN MOST PEOPLE MAKE IN A MONTH. It makes no sense.

Your governments reports are not random blogs. Where would you like me to start? Reports that are in your native language so you believe me? 27% of your country lives on 50 US CENTS a day. That is 1/2 dollar. That is a 2017 number. Going by actual poverty numbers(and not made up poverty numbers by your government to show india is "growing economically") the number is closer to 67% of people live on less than 6$ a day. That is $180 a month. Or  2160 a year. In the US, 2160 dollars is the tax, a year, on one midsize SUV..... 
So please, I dealt the facts, you have dealt the feelings. Please tell me which facts i got off blogs? I got these number from you governments "poverty" reports. Your government considers poverty below 50 us cents a day......

Keep trying to lie and make up stories. India is a third world country with no money. The people don't know what btc even is. Why would a poor third world middle class citizen flock to btc as you say after it gets an ok from the govt. I think India's government is the only one more corrupt than US. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:33:15
Uh oh.... Someone sold too early :( 
See kids, this is why you don't sell after reading FUD articles. Smart people buy on the fud articles and sell on the weekly highs. It pretty simple. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 01:27:43
No, sorry sir, I will not forget the facts. That facts are, exchanges from India are less than .01% of all btc trades a day. Even if OTC was 100x that (it's not) you would be at 1%. Sorry, I know it sucks to realize your country is a small financial drop in the bucket, but it is. 80% of your country can't feed itself regularly. They should clearly focus on food, antiseptics, not shitting in the street, treat women equally, and cleaning up their environmental disaster from slave labor and sweat shops. Btc is last on your list. Ohh, and shutting down those fucking call centers too. That would be a start.

It's funny you think you didn't lose because you " didn't sell" that is hilarious. Your portfolio dropped 50% but you didn't lose anything. That is very childish thinking. Most people bought more to take advantage of the dip. You can stop lying now. I know being old and unsuccessful is tough, but don't take your frustration out on some 30 something millionaires....

@_date: 2018-06-13 22:34:10
What's self explanatory is your childish notion that looking at a charts past is somehow indicative of a person's self loathing of what could have been. No real trader, bitcoin enthusiast, or stable genius lowers themselves to traits of a gambling addicted day trader that is emotional and unstable. I bought and mined 90% of my coins even before this run up last year,  I have bought the other 10% in the last 6 months on every dip. I could not be happier I have another chance to buy below 10k(and would be happy even if it goes all the way down to 1500 or lower). You should re-evaluate yourself and your life if you are always negatively living in the past like that. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 19:29:36
Do 2^256 on a calculator. Then divide it by 100... Shit divide it by 10000. That is a close estimate in years how slow even quantum computers of the 1000 qubit variant(those don't exist yet and of they did it would be in the billions of dollars). Dont believe the FUD. Most are trying to just sell you on a quantum resistant coin.

Small brain people think that bitfinex prints tether then gives out this free tether and people use it to buy bitcoin. They then think that free money handed out somehow manipulates the prices across all platforms and exchanges. Functionally retarded, I know.... But this is what bear mentality breeds.

I don't have any kids and made 7 figures last year thanks to Bitcoin gains. I paid all my taxes, now I sit back and watch all the old folks like you flop around because it took me 7 years to get what you got in 40. And now you're mad. It's ok. It wasn't fairies I promise. It was careful planning. Not trading too much, and investing what I was comfortable losing. 
If you lost no money in 2008... You are a lot more broke than I thought. Half of my net worth was wiped out in 2008. It wasn't much, but my 15 year 401k had lost a little more than half. Only came back within last 2 years.

My point in, the longer you live, the longer you realize, humans have JACK SHIT to do with the overall outcome. The world will heal itself.

You can argue semantics all day. Hacking/phishing accounts on your platform are public and were a problem roughly two years ago. You have since taken measures to account for your oversight, but brushing over the issue as if it didn't happen doesn't look good for you credibility.

Please be sure not to fall for the "renewable resource" BS. Renewable =/= No CO2 output. IE-biofuel is renewable by that definition. I'll admit wind and solar are near 0 but not when you consider production costs, maintenance, and replacement/expansion, it is not insignificant. By most skewed standards, Nuclear is renewable energy, which we know is a stretch.
Edit- also remember that still near 70% of US power production is still Coal........
@_date: 2019-01-23 20:51:51
I wonder what the statistics are on CO2 production to run something like, say, Reddit. Hundreds of milllions of users running their computers, most at work(production dollars lost) or mom's basement, the internet required, servers etc etc. Yet it is a viable information economy. I love how "smart" people use carbon dioxide output as some indicator of viability. When in reality it is just a dog whistle for their "green conscious" investors.

How does banning ivory reduce it's supply? If by that you mean confiscation, I will argue governments will start confiscating Bitcoin and not selling it like they have in the past. You obviously have a bias opinion and fail to acknowledge real world concepts when taking about Bitcoin. That's ok we all have our opinions. Please name one thing that has been banned that has decreased  in value? I said joking about kinder eggs, but in America the price of them went through the roof when the banned them.

Why do I have to link basic math??? It's math. A 100-150 qubit(current machine are in the 10-20 qubit and cost near $30 million, and roughly $1000 a day in electric and cooling, they operate at near absolute zero)  machine will reduce cracking time by a factor of 10,000. When you are talking billions of years in cracking time..... that factoral is a drop in the bucket. Mind you, you are still using a 10 million dollar computer to break a random address that MAY or MAY NOT have any btc in it. It's not like you can hack a single wallet. The fix??? move your btc once a year. Boom, Security FIXED.

You are an uneducated false prophet. You know saying "there is no support below 5000" is provably false because we can look at exchanges right?? Also, most buy orders for larger volumes do not show up on depth charts. Myself, I use bots to put in orders when it falls to a certain number. So those orders don't even show up until it gets to a percentage.. and there are many many people like me. It makes idiots like you say things like "there is no support at X", then it gets to x, my bot buys, I make a quick buck, and you look like an idiot.  You have literally no idea what you are talking about.

Mark my words. Bitcoin will crash to near zero if those coins in the genesis block ever move. Trust me. Not only would core believers think that if "satoshi is selling, Im out, too" but that sheer number of coins couldn't be absorbed into the trade volume. People shit they bed when "Gox is sellin muh coins" (only 16,000 coins mind you). Think about if the actual creator of all this sold his Million+ coins. It would be zero by the end of the day. 
Many people I know, myself included, have had alarms set on that address for a while. 
Edit-- as stated before 99% sure the REAL satoshi passed away. I think we are safe. Unless his last dying wish was to give away his key with instructions on when to disperse them.

Are you old enough for Y2K? May or may not, doesn't matter. This is the same scare that happening from 94-99 saying the y2k bug will "cause nuclear war" because of the run away conspiracies.

The amount of $$$$ in cyber security wants you to THINK Quantum computing is a thing to worry about so you buy more products and algos to offset the threat. Take the bait if you want. A solution to the problem would be change your pssword to your bank account once a month. boom. fixed. 
Quantum computers are 15-30 million dollars and cost thousands a DAY to operate.

Yup, great. People like you keep selling at 6200 and buying at 8100. See, most hodlers held through the $1 to $28, $100 - $1200, and 170 to $20,000. Most, Like myself, buy monthly regardless of price. I have the same 4.2 billion dollars, or 2 Bitcoin, as I did from years ago.

So how are those Enron stocks doing these days? Since, you know, you have it all figured with what investments are. There is literally no guarantee in any investment. The fact that you believe there are other venues out there that are guaranteed, shows your bias.
@_date: 2018-12-08 18:20:48
if you set up an old miner like and old S3 from bitmain and mine your own node, there is a chance(very small one) that you mine a block due to luck. It would take like 4 years of continuous mining but in 4 years when bitcoin is worth $340,000 6.25 btc would be a lot.
Edit- But remember you would be using 4 years of 300 watts of power/internet use, so it does cost you. It isn't free.

@_date: 2018-12-08 19:04:47
Ok, it would just take longer. The premise was miners turning of their miners and no one mining. If we got to a point where no one was mining(will never happen) a laptop would be able to be a lottery machine. There is also other coins to mine that a laptop would have a fighting chance. A lottery machine doesn't just work on bitcoin.

Came to comment about your inability to make a viable argument. You know in certain parts of the world I have been, they still use sea shells and pieces of sea glass to trade for goods and services. I have never used them. Because I am ignorant to other people in the world, does that mean shells and sea glass aren't currency? No it means you are a bitter fool that needs to work on your logical fallacies.

Arguably, this is the dumbest thread ever. Literally. 
But I'll bite. 
In less than 10 years there will be solar powered satellite internet that is basically all run at the satellite level. These will last for many years. In an end of world scenario less likely than literally anything, these can be utilized by the prized few. But even USD would be useless at that point, trade would not very quickly adopt a "universal" cash system as it does in your game as people will have the fresh memory of total anarchy and would only trust things like water, food, and shelter for trade, maybe precious metals, but a strong maybe.  So your question is based on a very unlikely game, with a very unlikely plot, and very unlikely situation.

Easy- 5 BTC @ $18,000 buy in, 4.25 BTC (day trade losses by listening to Reddit) @ $2,500 panic sell = an 86% loss or a write off of roughly $68,000. Pretty simple math. 2500 will be price December 31. Mark my words.
