MACD is like knowing the cheat code.

Not to forget, BTC AntMiners are now double the price they were only a few weeks ago, sold by a company that openly supports BTH.

I have so far scanned with Malewarebytes and found nothing. Next I will be using Bitdefender to ascertain if anything has been installed or added that should not be there. If this scan comes back clean I will re-install the app and see if the dialogue pops up once more.

Both the quick and full scans from Bitdefender report nothing malicious so this may be a legitimate popup connected to this software in some way.

Its odd and most likely a coincidence that this updater initiated within a few minutes of installing the app. It certainly had no appeared prior to Moonitor being installed, but did continue after it was removed.
What can I say, when an odd popup window appears, that you have not seen before moments after installing an app from an untested source, anyone would be more than worried it was malicious.
However, for the purposes of this thread, Im convinced this is just a coincidence and nothing more.

Sorry I didn't screenshot as I just removed it. I don't use any Adobe products, so this is why I'm flagging this. If you find it hard to believe, go ahead and install the app. I could be wrong, but I'm just making people aware. If the OP can confirm there is an Adobe addon within the app, this may alleviate any future scares.

In addition, here is the same issue being discussed on the apple site.

I have dug a little deaper and found the plist is as follows:
    &lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
    &lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "
    &lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
    &lt;dict&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;string&gt;com.adobe.ARMDCHelper.cc24aef4a1b90ed56a725c38014c95072f92651fb65e1bf9c8e43c37a23d420d&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;array&gt;
		&lt;string&gt;/Library/Application Support/Adobe/ARMDC/Application/Acrobat Update Helper.app/Contents/MacOS/Acrobat Update Helper&lt;/string&gt;
	&lt;/array&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;true/&gt;
	&lt;key&gt;StartInterval&lt;/key&gt;
	&lt;integer&gt;12600&lt;/integer&gt;
    &lt;/dict&gt;
    &lt;/plist&gt;
Nothing dubious there so if it is related it's not malicious as far as I can tell.

Re-installed the app and this is back.
I do not have Adobe Acrobat installed and this popup only appeared after installing this app.

I Installed the MAC version and within a few minutes received an odd looking Adobe update dialogue box that didn't look quite right. No option to cancel the update. Had to force quit the dialogue. Immediately removed the app and now looking for malware.
