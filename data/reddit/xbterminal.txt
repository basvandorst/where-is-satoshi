Oh, nice, someone seen it on the bitcoin-dev mailing list and posted. 
Yes, we're developing this thing and will start seriously pushing it soon. 
quick explanation:
- we call it XBTerminal
- it's an official video, but the post wasn't intentional, it's a leak, but we don't mind.
- it's NFC based with QR code fallback, QR codes to be shown on the screen 
- yes, second NFC tap is for PDF receipt download, it is optional. 
- no, it doesn't support BIP70 yet. Supporting it is not a problem, problem is that it's not certain yet in which way this should be implemented. We're working in coordination with Andreas Schildbach on this, have ideas. And of course it needs full support from wallet app side before it will work well that way.

We have also implemented Andreas' Bluetooth implementation of the bitcoin payment protocol in our bitcoin hardware POS, XBTerminal. Check us out at  to see a demo of our hardware.

Apologies, we are a multi-national team.  We have updated the text and thanks for the feedback, it is always welcome.

This is indeed a labor intensive attack, and not sure if it's worth doing for few bucks you'll get out of a coffee cup sale etc. 
However we have a measure against this in our roadmap - we will be showing the name of the store on the terminal screen along with PKI certificate confirming it, and the same name will be shown on the phone before you pay.
