I am not a tax professional and therefore cannot answer that specific question for you. What I can tell you is that stocks, bonds, notes and other assets considered to be securities do not qualify as like-kind exchanges in the eyes of the IRS. So, is a crypto coin a unit of currency or is it a security? Why did you buy it, and what is your goal in holding it? When I say this is a legal grey area, this is what I’m referring to. There are many questions to which there aren’t clear answers yet.

Thanks for the link, this is excellent!

It can take up to 10 days for a transaction to clear on Coinbase. During that time, the money will be withdrawn from your bank and the transaction cleared behind the scenes. Rest assured, it will clear at Coinbase. If it hasn’t been more than 10 days, just remain patient. If it has been more than 10 days, then I would contact them.

Thank you for sharing this, and you are correct that this is another interpretation of how to handle coin to coin transactions. You are also correct that the IRS might disagree with this handling, but like you said you would be acting in good faith. Thanks for the response and share.

Maybe I’m confused as to what you are trying to say. My original point was that there is IRS guidance for how digital currencies are interpreted by the IRS, and I have provided that link. There is no guidance suggesting that the IRS considers or will ever consider crypto to crypto transactions to be like-kind exchanges. Therefore, when a transaction is made, from one coin to another, it is a safe bet that the IRS will expect that transaction to be reported and capital gains paid in that tax year.

Personally, I would not report the transfer of Bitcoin from one wallet to another that are both owned by me. Of course, I would have record of the transaction if I was asked about it, but there is no sale or transfer of the Bitcoin to another person or for another kind of asset or currency. I personally think what you described would be like moving a stock in-kind from one brokerage to another, which is not a taxable event.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:17:04
Valid assumption about the IRS. Personally, I think the IRS is going to have a hard time going back and identifying every non-reporting crypto holder. They may try to make some examples, but there will likely be a lot of people who get by not reporting before some kind of legislation is passed requiring exchanges and or banks to report such transactions. But, in the same breath, I personally don’t want to be one that they decide to make an example of.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:45:06
Lol, it’s not a game. Good luck with trying to claim like kind exchanges. I genuinely hope you are successful, but there is no substantial authority for the use of Section 1031 exchanges with cryptocurrencies. I’ll let you be the guinea pig.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:00:20
That is correct. You do not report anything until you sell. The same applies for stocks. As you can tell from this discussion thread, there are mixed opinions on how to report, but there is no disagreement about not having to report something until you sell and/or swap from one coin to another.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:11:07
IRS currently interprets cryptocurrencies to be a form of property, meaning every transaction is reportable as a capital gains/loss event. Like I said, it is still very much a legal grey area, but if you ask the IRS they will tell you that you must report every transaction that involves the transfer of property.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:49:31
The guidance on cryptocurrency that has been established by the IRS is that a sale from one coin to another, like VTC to BTC or any coin to another coin, is considered a taxable event. That being said, it is still a legal grey area. It is unclear what the IRS can and will know about any one person’s cryptocurrency transactions. So, if you choose to not report (because you don’t think the IRS will find out or for any other reason), you run the risk of tax evasion. That is a decision that you have to make for yourself. Generally speaking, you are better off paying the piper and erring on the side of reporting, but again this is something you need to work out for yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:21:15
Yes, but there is also no precedent that I’m aware of that suggests they will accept that argument with regard to cryptocurrencies. Not saying it’s not worth pursuing, but it’s important to acknowledge that the safest interpretation is that exchanges from one coin to another will be considered taxable events.

This is false, use Google.

Two questions, two answers. It’s your responsibility as a tax payer to report any and all income. Ignorance of the law is not a valid defense. Like speeding, it doesn’t matter if you don’t know what the speed limit is or if there wasn’t a sign. A judge may decide to throw your case out, but you are still breaking the law. Secondly, no, there is no way to know what the IRS does and doesn’t have on you. For the most part, they aren’t collecting boxes of information on you. For most people, if you get flagged for an audit they will investigate to a certain extent matters related to the nature of the audit, but it is just too impossible for them to be actively and deeply collecting mountains of information on hundreds of millions of tax payers.

The IRS doesn’t care when you buy a mutual fund because they know that when you sell it the financial institution that facilitated your trade has a legal obligation to report your transaction. Conversely, those same reporting standards don’t exist with crypto exchanges. The IRS is interested in financial transactions involving crypto because they know most people never reported their trades, and there currently doesn’t exist a legal mandate for exchange reporting.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:04:55
By IRS guidance, yes, unfortunately. Although, there is hope that interpretation will change.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:07:15
Maybe you should learn to use Google.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:59:22
That’s exactly what I said.
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:42:22
In my interpretation of IRS opinion, yes. There are some who would argue that you can claim that as a like-kind exchange, report such and defer taxes until you eventually sell back to USD, but I disagree with that opinion. And when I say that “I disagree with that opinion”, I just mean I don’t think the IRS will see it that way.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:26:10
It doesn’t work like that. If you bought 1 BTC at $10k and sold 0.5 BTC at $20k, then you have a capital gain of $5,000, which is taxable. Half your sale is premium and the other half is profit.

Remember that you still have four months before 2017 taxes are due. Google is your friend. Take the time to Google information on this topic. Read as many different opinions as you can. It’s far too important of a topic to not put the time into researching.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:18:21
Does the IRS care, yes. Will it likely ever show up on their radar for such a small amount, doubtful. Does that excuse you from your legal responsibility to do what is right and pay taxes on capital gains, no. But remember that if you hold an investment for a term greater than 1 year and then sell, you only owe long term capital gains (15% capped) on the profit. If you buy at $20 and sell at $100, that’s $80 profit, of which you’ll owe $12 in taxes. Will the IRS come knocking on your door if you don’t pay this, almost certainly not, but why give them a reason to for such a small amount?

If you are talking BTC, it’s my understanding that a well motivated investigator could trace all of the transactions, albeit with ample time and resources to do so. Certain privacy coins like Monero may make it much harder to impossible to trace. That being said, it is probably more unlikely than likely that the IRS is going to be able to trace all or any of your crypto activity. How would they know? They would likely have to be tipped in some way initially, either by subpoenaed account documents from Coinbase or another online exchange, a random audit that catches a suspicious financial transaction, a bank flag due to the size or origin of a financial deposit or withdrawal, etc. Like I said, these things are unlikely to happen, but can happen. In the end, I personally prefer to do the right (and lawful) thing even when nobody is looking. Makes it easier to sleep at night, but to each their own. Good luck!

As others have said, the scope of the IRS inquiry doesn’t include activity in 2017. As for mutual funds, yes, if you sell any amount of a registered financial security in a taxable account in the United States, the IRS has record of that transaction. But, remember, you don’t owe taxes until you sell, which is what triggers a capital gain/loss. Same thing with crypto. If you bought BTC and never sold, you don’t have a taxable event (yet). If you sold, then you do.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:50:59
This is correct. Digital currency balances are not insured at Coinbase, only USD balances up to the FDIC limit of $250,000 per depositor.

Coinbase, Bittrex, Binance, and I would assume most other legitimate exchanges will all let you turn 2FA off on your accounts through an identity verification process. It’s kind of a pain in the ass, but it’s for your safety. Once you pass the identity inspections, you can setup 2FA on your account(s) again through Google Authenticator. When you do this, make sure to copy down the backup codes and keep them in a safe place in case this happens to you again.

Bitcoin is bitcoin. There is no such thing as buying shares of Bitcoin or buying the actual thing. They are either the same exact thing or what you are buying is a complete scam. The only difference can be in who holds the keys to the wallet that is storing your bitcoin. If you are buying Bitcoin through a website or app, that website or app (exchange) is almost certainly holding the Bitcoin for you. This should only ever be a temporary solution for you, as whoever controls the private keys controls the Bitcoin. If you want to know with 100% certainty that the Bitcoin is yours, withdraw it to a wallet where you possess the private keys. If you don’t know what I’m talking about, Google that.

This is an excellent question and something to consider. I’m in the same situation and actually thought about this the other day. Considered just writing something up myself and including it with my mnemonic in a safety deposit box that my wife would find if something were to happen to me. Of course, she doesn’t even know what a Bitcoin is. Maybe she’s heard of it, I don’t know. I could see her just throwing away my Ledger thinking it’s yet another giveaway USB device.

Because Coinbase doesn’t extend credit to its users, there is no credit inquiry or new tradelines reported to credit rating agencies. If you buy through Coinbase with a credit card, the amount of that transaction will be reflected on your credit card balance, which is reported (as a total along with all of your other credit card purchases, but not the details of the transaction itself). If you pay your credit cards off in full every month, which you should do, the responsible and active use of credit, in addition to lowering your total debt to credit ratio, will increase your credit score. If you are buying from Coinbase with a bank account, that also has no relationship to your credit score, as those accounts aren’t reported to credit rating agencies.
Not saying that this will change your parent’s mind, just letting you know that they are either telling you that to simply deflect your request or because they misunderstand how a credit score is calculated and what a credit report actually monitors (which is true for most people).
