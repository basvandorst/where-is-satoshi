It's already a bitcoin protocol link. I hope it works now.

Let me declare that I am seeing wintermute for first time and I am not affiliated with him/her in past.
Having said that, Gumlet is here for long term. I would not put my real name and twitter profile everywhere if I wanted to do scam. Apart from that, we keep the minimum amount very low so anyone can try and gain trust in system.
The risk of loss for users is only for the bet amount. Believe me I know how fast news spreads on reddit if I ever don't repay or play fair on Gumlet. I would never want to tarnish reputation which is linked with my real identity.
This is totally automated and computer operated platform. Needless to say any human is not involved in any step during transaction.
I thank you for your concern and it's legit given how many frauds happen. If there is anything, please feel free to reach out to me.

Hi, 
It adjusts multipliers so that more than one trade on same option at same time has reduced multipliers. 
This is there to protect the system from exploit because one user can send bitcoins from multiple address to same option and earn way more than maximum possible. I hope you get it. Such system is in place in all binary trading platforms.

Btw, the multipliers in above tables are also updated in real-time so you can check the current multiplier just before starting trade so that you bet on desired multiplier.

Sure, I will love to get feedback from them.

You can try  for bincoin binary options. You can benefit from both up and down price movements.

Hi, it just waits for confirmation from blockchain. As soon as transaction is confirmed, it will process it. Don't worry the payout and all remains the same.
You can see that the transaction is now processed.

I am creator of  - a binary option trading for bitcoins.
The biggest advantage of that platform is that the trades are transparent and very easy to initiate. Entire flow is automatic and once you win the bet, reward is given automatically to you to alleviate need for manual intervention. 
Minimum trade amount is 0.01 BTC and highest is currently 0.5 BTC. We will increase the limit once we are confident about stability of our platform. Please don't use exchange wallet for trade, they are creating problems while giving you the reward. We advise you to send 0.001 BTC from your wallet, our system will automatically reject the transaction because it is below the lower limit and try to refund your BTC. If you get refund in your wallet, you can confidently send real trade to our platform.
We follow bitstamp.net for price of the bitcoin at any given time and use trade time from blockchain.info. We take last traded price as starting and ending price which is most logical and predictable way to trade bitcoins.
Fail safe strategy of the code is to refund your bitcoins. This ensures that in case of any system failure or blockchain.info or bitstamp.net API failure, we gracefully fall-back and don't keep your bitcoins with us.
We have created it keeping in mind simplicity and ease of use for traders. The entire app is responsive and you can know about trades in real-time. The app is built on nodejs and features use of all latest technologies like WebSockets. Hope you guys will enjoy the new platform. You can mail us your suggestions or reach out to us directly on twitter.
We are always here to stay and rest assured that your bitcoins are safe with us. You can publicly search our twitter and linkedin profiles and we are real person with real identities. Only advise from us is that you understand the platform before you start a trade. If something goes wrong from our system, rest assured that your BTC are safe with us and we will fully refund it in case there is some issue. 
If you think you made a trade by a mistake, please send a mail to us and we will refund full amount to you with zero questions asked. We are here to provide best service to traders.

It was indeed an error. In such cases, rest assured that your bitcoins are always safe. We have refunded your bitcoins.

I have clearly stated that the multipliers are dynamic. When there is one bet going on same address, the multipliers become less so the system is not exploited. Please check the multipliers before you press send button. They are updated in real-time on gumlet.com. You can also use this API if you like to check it programmatically:

Hi, thanks for your feedback. I have no plans for faucet in next 1-2 months but I will surely consider it. Meanwhile if you have some bitcoin, you can give it a try.
@_date: 2016-07-03 19:23:14
Hi, we have already stated in the table that minimum bet amount is 0.002. Since your amount is below it, we have automatically denied and refunded you after deducting transaction fees. 
The dynamic multiplier part might not be very clear. I will add it in how-to section of site.
