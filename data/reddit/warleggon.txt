Cherry picking vs reality for most people. Best advice is as soon as you double your portfolio by hodling, take back your original investment and take a chance on the rest for the future as you will loose nothing this way but stand to make profit if we go to the moon.
We can't all afford to DCA. Do what's best for you and don't keep investing if you don't have the income to support it.

American drug industry and healthcare is not a free market, it's a cartel meaning you pay more for drugs and medical treatment than practically anywhere else in the world. It's corporate fascism where 650,000 go bankrupt due their medical bills while in the EU that number is zero. The corporate fascists who hate socialized medicine convince dumb Americans to vote against their own interests to keep the corrupt systems that benefit the 1% and screw the rest of you.

Those days have gone and only a few got in early enough in 2017 to make profit and sold at the right time. A lot more got rekt as the value of those alts against Bitcoin has plummeted since.

CNBC's marketing Manager, Gaby Wasenteiner's is married to an active bcash promoter too.

Whereas in the US, 650,000 people go bankrupt each year due to medical bills while in the EU it's zero. If you guys profit from bitcoin much, keep it for medical bills, you may have to as insurance only covers so much unless you pay a fortune each month. Meanwhile most of the civilized western world can enjoy socialized health care.

LTC is better than your centralized scam coin that cannot scale and will destroy Bcash without any help from BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:16:44
You should never leave large amounts of coin on an exchange. If they get hacked or go under you will lose your coins. Use Electrum (uses segwit) or Exodus or similar. You don't need to download the blockchain core wallet.

LOL Bcash, no scaling, will be centralized, only got a pump from shady dealings with CNBC and coinbase  who's owner is pro Bcash shitcoin for his mate Roger.
BCash is worse than LTC.

If your in Europe try bittylicious. It took me 2 days to get verified there.

The high transfer fees should not bother hodlers. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:44:50
I would be more worried about keeping coins on coinbase than a swing in the price of BTC. No private keys, not your coin.
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:18:19
Is that how it works?
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:57:36
Its reported that the  CNBC marketing director's partner was a major shill for bcash and CB's owner is anti BTC and pro bcash.
Needs further investigation to be shown true or not or what parts are.

Sorry, corrected now.

Literally a roller coaster ride.

Electric cars are 100 plus year old tech, hydrogen fuel cells are the future. Elon is just Mr Hype, Thunderf00t on Youtube exposes him. The rockets are good but they're based on Nasa designs, nothing new at all. He cannot compete in the mass market with out the NASA subs and vanity projects for the rich niche.
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:45:19
It's pure hype, nothing new at all.
@_date: 2019-06-16 23:00:38
Even the rich will regret buying a Tesla, there just is no reason as to why buying one in the first place. Total waste of money unless you love hype and being ripped off for fashionable reasons Worse than the Doc buying a DeLorean.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:13:08
Can you guarantee a correction? Hodling for a few years seems the best way to get profits. Of course you should take back your original investment given the chance so you don't lose out and take a chance on the rest for the longer term.

Massive dump a few minutes ago, went down 700 in seconds bit recovered to around low 13s again
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:44:21
Another big dump, lost 1K in 10 seconds down to low 12s
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:44:44
Tesla is pure hype for a rich and niche market and cannot compete with the competition for price in a general market. They only offer a turbo version of 100 year old tech for a very limited buyer audience.
Hydrogen fuel cells are the future, not this hyped up ancient tech that dumb people think are alt versions of lambo's,
Americans are so easily duped. 
Elon knows how dumb you are, has nothing new to offer, plays on hype and uses Government subs based on old NASA designs for even his rocket business. Watch Thunderf00t on youtube who exposes this clown.
@_date: 2019-06-16 22:19:20
Renault, Toyota, Honda, Nissan, BMW, Hyundai, VW and Citroen, to name just a few. Tesla is just pure hype and a rich mans niche market, not for mass production in a market they can never compete in. Even electric cars are based on 100 plus year old technology. 
Hydrogen fuel cell cars are the future. Tesla is 99% hype, please get real.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:52:55
That's certainly true in my case.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:43:24
 Hydrogen fuel cell tech has the advantage of not stopping to charge up (battery tech has more or less reached it's limits) with all the advantages of hydro carbon carrying cars, without the pollution. Please get real and out the dinosaur age. Battery powered cars are old hat.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:57:53
You should focus on real things of value like houses, gold or better tech for the future like Hydrogen fuel cell cars rather than the hype of ancient technology like battery powered cars with your bitcoin profits.
