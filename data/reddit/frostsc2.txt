lol stupid people
i mined bitcoins before you knew what they were you dumb cunt
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:00:45
I mined my coins in 2011... It hit zero a few times before, hence I'm asking is this the end.
If the China news is real, then the US will likely follow and not allow bitcoins to flourish, hurting its value in the long run.
 
@_date: 2013-12-18 07:01:07
why would I do that? I didn't pay a penny for my coins, mined them years ago
@_date: 2013-12-10 06:40:05

@_date: 2013-12-17 04:42:25
I wont be selling regardless, but the price seems to be free falling with the china news :[
