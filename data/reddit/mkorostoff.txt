Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by "inward collapse"?

I didn't downvote, but this comment also has not contributed anything to my understanding of the topic.

Thanks!  This is totally the answer I was looking for, I truly had never heard of "the blockchain" before this thread.  Can you explain some of the other uses you envision for the blockchain?

Understood.  If I may ask a follow up question: what would it take to persuade you that the technology, while fundamentally sound, has reached its high water mark of social and economic influence?

I guess I have trouble believing that your commitment to bitcoin (or your commitment to anything for that matter) could truly run that deep.  Think about what you're saying here: that your beliefs about bitcoin are immune to changing circumstance.  What if there was a Mt. Gox sized collapse once a month for three years?  What if the only reliable exchanges were being used to finance terrorism? What if the government made draconian regulations?  I feel like you might be dreaming a little small when you say "no outside factor."
And it not—if your viewpoint is *truly* immune to changing facts as you say—I honestly find that idea pretty scary.

I just had to google this blockchain idea, but I believe I understand it.  Can you explain what uses you see for this concept outside of bitcoin?

Can you give me some other examples of hypothetical uses?
