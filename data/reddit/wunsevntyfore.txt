Feel free to give [Gemini]( a shot. Having used both, I obviously prefer the latter. Give yourself options.

RemindMe! 2 weeks "LOL"

I never said they did. They invented social networking with *exclusivity*. They truly understand the intricate details that makes something uniquely successful, and I'm putting a lot faith in them (specifically Cameron, who seems to run most of the operations). Having pen-tested their demo site, which exists as a bug bounty program, I have a lot of confidence in their methodology and attention to security. That alone garners my business.

Both. Been playing this game for nearly 7 years and the rebound climb is in-progress. If you're looking for the right time to invest, it's now. The ~$12k wall has held, and it's rebound time. Catch the train.

Nah, Asia is waking up. All they see is a huge sale.

Honestly, I'm not too big on their UI either. I'd like to be able to see graphing and reporting on ETH trading prices along-side BTC trades. They are indeed Segwit adopted, but have constantly posted about the delays on the blockchain. I have a feeling they will be a full supporting of Lightning Network -- their recent "downtime" posts pretty much suggests a considerable lack of ability to trade at a functional level.
The Winklevii pretty much invented the idea of Facebook, from an IP view. They invested a large portion of their fortune in Gemini, so I have faith. Give it time.

I'll go ahead and "RemindMe! 2 weeks" this post so you can learn a serious lesson that you'll hopefully not repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:29:17
Keep in mind that many people will set a sell-limit on a round, even number (in this case, $20k, which it *did* momentarily hit). This makes selling at that wall pretty illogical, as the majority of sell orders will not even go through due to the overwhelming number of automated sell-limits happening simultaneously. This will obviously drop the price considerably. Most people that don't get their orders immediately fulfilled panic, and sell at whatever price they can, thinking the bottom is about to drop out.
A piece of advice: if you're a seller, drop your sell point down from the inevitable wall by ~$400-600 (in this case, $19.4-19.6k), so that your order is very likely to be fulfilled.
Set that buy-limit at $21-22k -- at that point, the hurdle will be over and the run will be back on up to $30k. I wouldn't expect the next round of major sell-offs until that point ($25k should be fairly insignificant).
Expect all of this to happen again, and again, and again. Simply put, buy now and be patient.

[Gemini]( has been functional all day and I ordered near the very bottom of the dip without issue. I'd suggest switching up exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:13:17
In the terms of currency, and the longevity of our lives, it *will* be inevitable to *us*. As someone previously eloquently put it, the majority of Bitcoin users haven't even been born yet. Let that sink in. We are still on the ground floor.
Bear cycles can be long and painful, but this is a revolutionary currency. It doesn't apply to the same playbook for "normal" vesting. This is uncharted territory, and once you understand the full potential of the technology, you'll realize there is no comparison and no real map for any of this, minus 5-6 years of practical experience for some of us.
Consider the immediate moment one hell of a sale, primarily funded by unfounded fear coupled with technological constraints. The mempool will clear and future mitigating techniques (e.g. Lightning) will change the entire game. Give faith to the technology, the development teams, the individual contributors, and forego the short-sells fueled by anxiety.
BTC is still up 40% from the beginning of the month (unless my math is wrong). Just hodl, ride the next 8-9 day stagnant holiday, and wake up January 2nd with a smile on your face. This isn't anything new to many of us.
RemindMe! 9 days "Smile."
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:19:16
Santa just delivered you one hell of a sale. Enjoy!
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:03:58
Got mine at $80 USD no more than a month ago. Give it a week or two, at most a month. The price will reset.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:42:11
Given the staggered holiday week, it might take a little longer to hit $17.5k, but come the 2nd of January, I fully expect a significant surge. 
RemindMe! 9 days "17.5+?"
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:40:33
Not sure it'll hit that low, and if it does, it'll trigger an incredibly amount of automated buy-limits. If you're going to ride that wall, set your price point at $10.5k. Otherwise, buy now.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:53:51
As a veteran, buy now. And I mean right now. You're going to see a serious rebound before the end of the weekend.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:09:04
Someone has *way* too much time on their hands. I got a solid laugh at the sincerity trying to be conveyed. Cute.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:57:30
Your gut serves you right. If you are looking for a time to invest, it's right now.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:26:10
Despite the current extravagant fee, it'll be an exceptionally generous gift, especially to those who don't understand concept quite yet. It'll spur many conversations and investment ideas.
It's really not different than buying someone a savings bond... except a shitload more exciting, and you don't need to wait 30 years to touch it, should you remember it's actually still there.
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:10:35
Please, sell more. Everything you have. I'd love to buy at $10k; it'll most definitely secure my early retirement.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:50:28
Bought at $12.5k and it's on the rise. Don't get greedy and just buy now. I have no doubts it'll be back to $17.5k+ by the end of the weekend.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:18:52
That's safe, and that would've been very sweet to get in at 10.5, but I'm not sure it'll hit that low again. $10k is "meaningful" to people (and especially automated investments), so I very seriously doubt it'll dip that low again.
I hate to say it, but now is probably going to be your best bet on hitting the bottom of the dip ($12.1-12.5). Yeah, it's been like this a couple of days, but come tomorrow/Tuesday, I have a very strong feeling things will change rapidly.
RemindMe! 2 days
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:16:56
[Trezor]( I was hesitant at first; haven't felt an ounce of regret since.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:40:05
Roger? Is that you? Merry Christmas, asshole! What's prison like?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:32:09
Automated selloffs at $20k. Quarterly profit reports due for a lot of investors (inducing sell-off). General concern amongst the new buyers due to a total lack of experiencing these dives. Technological hiccups.
The rebound is inevitable. The difficult part is figuring out where the dip-wall will be so one can buy at the right time.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:49:09
I would normally advise against this, but considering the price is $12.7k USD, the fees would prove negligible in the coming weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:02:06
The irony of this post is lost on so many.
