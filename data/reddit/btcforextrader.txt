Strange... shouldn't USDT's price be taking a nosedive after such devastating news? Hmmm....
@_date: 2018-01-25 11:32:05
All I can say is... 
Buena suerte.
@_date: 2018-01-21 04:45:51


Nah, I just know what I'm doing. Apparently, you don't. :)


It's all relative.
When fees are "high", people need to be smarter with their transactions, and need to make sure that they aren't paying too much just because the mempool is high. This is the biggest mistake people make. People pay what they THINK they need to pay instead of what they should pay. There are plenty of tools available to help people determine what's the best fee to pay at a given time. Using those tools, I've almost never had to pay more than what I said. I do an average of 1-2 transactions per day. Although admittedly, I didn't do that many while I was in Bali for the holidays over the past month. :P
 
"The polar opposite of your "fee-whiners" are people like yourself, "fee-deniers": fees are never high. Same shit."
I'm not a fee denier. I'm a fee pragmatist and optimizer. :)
I understand the importance of educating myself on how to set fees most efficiently so BTC benefits me,  no matter what is happening on the network. 
Let's face facts. The main reason most users pay too much is because they rely too heavily on Coinbase or some exchange wallet, and actually think that they have no say or control over what fees they pay. This causes people to pay ridiculously high fees even when the mempool isn't backed up and the block rate is ahead of the curve. 
Use the right wallet, do the right research before making a transaction (takes me a whole 1-2 minutes each time) and yeah, you'll never pay too much. One thing for sure, I ALWAYS pay well below the average fee just for doing that. 
What users also need to do is learn how to PRIORITIZE transactions. Too many users are under the mindset that a transaction has to confirm immediately, as in the next block, when it's totally unnecessary. If I'm willing to wait for a transaction to confirm within 25-50 blocks, I'll save plenty on fees, and it's almost NEVER a problem for a transaction to confirm within a few hours. 
Lower priority transaction? Fine, wait longer, set it to within 100 blocks (about 12-16 hours) and pay even less. Simple common sense moves that go a long way in ensuring that you don't pay ridiculously high fees, and will have to find something else to whine about.

"Yes, im gullible because I don't have 100% faith in someone who claims to have $2.2 billion dollars with absolutely no proof."
Yes, you're gullible if you think that horseshit affects Bitcoin.
"You're obviously sitting on some major losses right now and upset at people for selling. "
I bought more than 2 years ago, and I profit from BTC no matter what the price is, gullible dolt.
"p.s. I happen to have nearly [1500 BTC]( Just send me 0.1 bitcoin and I'll give you back 1.0 bitcoin for your trouble. "
Sure ya do. Yet, you whine like a clueless noob. I'm impressed.

And... that's you. The fact is that there is a way to trade profitably, and all it takes is some basic knowledge. There are tools that make doing it a lot easier for the average layperson. While most people fail dismally at day trading, doesn't mean everyone is. There are a few of us who are doing it right.

Nobody cares.
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:22:40
Really??? :D 
The only reason it's anywhere near that high is because that shitcoin is being constantly pumped by Ver and Co, and because of their fraudulent FUD campaign as well as their antics via Bitcoin.com and their shit wallet. Their actual goal was to take over at least half of BTC's value, and they have failed miserably at that. They're the laughingstock of crypto, even more so than Bitconnect. Get a clue already. :D
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:47:05
Yeah, they finally burned themselves out. The latest dips scared the shit out of them, since BTRASH sunk even further than BTC. :D
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:18:22
I don't tell people to trade cryptos. I do, but that's the riskier side of my trading portfolio. My bread and butter trading is strictly forex, using BTC as my base currency.

Talk about fat, slow and expensive... I've been waiting for an ETH transaction to confirm for TWO FUCKING DAYS, even though I paid 4x the usual gas fee. Guess what, I have never waited longer than 12 hours for a BTC transaction to confirm, and have always paid lower than average fee.

Such insanely stupid FUD.
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:05:21
Why are exchanges allowing trading in and out of Tether? Do you think they would risk getting left holding the bag if they suspected Tether was shaky? Why isn't Tether getting dumped on the markets to the point where its value is well under $1? Tether's volume is a drop in the bucket, and it's being used to trade in ALL of crypto, not just BTC (which currently accounts for -35% of the total volume. )
Nobody gives a shit about Tether, except BTRASH Fudsters, gullible suckers and clueless noobs. People who leave their coins on exchanges always assume a certain degree of risk anyway. Don't want the risk? Don't leave your coins on an exchange. Problem solved.

If you bought BTC strictly because you think it will hit "1mil someday", you clearly didn't get into it with the right mindset. Once you "get it", you'll come to understand that BTC's market price doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things.

@_date: 2018-01-28 05:01:58


Bonds are NOT currency. You can't spend them at a restaurant or a drug store. They are a LOAN to the government, which can be bought and sold as an asset. 


If they don't keep up with inflation, they fail to preserve capital. Anytime inflation goes over 3% a year, most T-bills end up being net zero or negative for the year. Average inflation in the US since early 1900's has been around 3.2%, oh well.


You're right, you just lose purchasing power, and net asset value. 


Naw... really?




Again, you make it sound like you can dictate the future, which is utterly ridiculous. You, like most people, fail to understand that things are not going back to the way they were. Bitcoin's arrival (and other cryptos, to a lower degree) has disrupted the financial world irreversibly. If anything, it spells the demise of the current financial systems (especially central bank-controlled fiat currency systems) and a total revolution. Knowing what I know now, I'll never go back to fiat, other than for spending money. 


It freed people like me. And it will continue to do so for more people who understand and harness its true power and potential. If you think that you will fare better with shitty fiat and the current financial scams happening, then all I can say is... see ya in 20 years. 


Oh, you think so eh? I'm not in the US, you assumptive dweeb. 


People can choose not to be tracked. It requires diligence and planning.  
 


Sounds to me like you're a weak little sheep who just surrenders to the powers that be. But not all of us are like you. 
 &gt; The same will happen with bitcoin. It will never be what you people dream it will be, governments and Fortune 50 companies will figure out how to control it, manipulate it, and use to to their advantage, etc..
So far, they're failing miserably. The banks and governments have been trying to kill off Bitcoin since it was conceived, and the stronger it becomes, the harder it becomes to defeat. Money badger doesn't care about governments and corporate power. Just sounds to me like you clearly have no clue about the game you're in. You've bought the bullshit drivel, and you'll continue to spew party lines rather than think for yourself. For fuck's sake, you tried to defend T-bills as being better than Bitcoin!!! :D :D :D :D 


Cash has already gone by the wayside. Governments don't even want cash anymore. They want to be able to control money digitally, and yeah, they're having a hard ass time doing that with Bitcoin, Monero and other truly decentralized cryptos. Pull your head out of your ass, and learn a bit more about what's going on. You clearly know nothing now. 
But hey, extol the virtues of T-bills with me again.... :D :D :D :D 
Yeah, we're done. :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:45:17

@_date: 2018-01-27 15:48:59
It's a nice feeling eh? 
Thanks to BTC, my girlfriend and I travel the world full-time, and enjoy a stress-free life. I still trade Forex and Crypto with a portion of my BTC nest-egg that delivers a consistent income with little or no risk, while increasing my BTC capital. One of my missions is to help other people learn to do what I'm doing (for essentially free), and that's what I'll be working on in the coming months. Time to pay it forward. :)
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:04:49
Some people (aka whiners) will NEVER be happy. 
And it's funny how even when the mempool was 200k+ and people were claiming fees were "high" I was getting my transactions confirmed for around 70-80 sat/b within 2-3 hours max. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 11:58:33
Guess you shouldn't have responded to my comment then, eh? 
Talk about pointless. :D
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:13:17
Funny how you think you can tell me what I'm doing. :D
First of all, while I got in relatively early, I didn't get in nearly as early as most people on this sub. Second of all, living off the profits I'm generating rather than on the capital itself means I'm doing something right. It took a bit of trial and error to get to this point, and it helped that I have a strong background in both stock trading as well as forex. 
But yeah, you probably shouldn't jump to conclusions about what people are doing, you don't know what you think you know. 
@_date: 2018-01-28 04:33:48


T-bills aren't fiat. They're bonds. And the interest you earn on them is a joke. Essentially breaks you even with inflation at normal rates. 


Those are some hilarious probabilities. You really think that fiat currency is still going to be around in its current state in 100 years??? 


Who's being obtuse??? :D
@_date: 2018-01-24 08:07:56
Already replied to this horseshit on another comment. And as I said before, I have nothing to do with Tether. Just saying that as of now, there seems to be much ado about nothing. And the fact that Fudsters try to pitch that Tether is somehow propping up BTC's makes it all the more ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:01:38

I diversify into other cryptos, and buy more BTC with my profits.  Works great.. :)
@_date: 2018-01-27 04:14:00
Because it wasn't working, maybe? And they were wasting money/resources to keep doing it, maybe?
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:26:10
Oh boy, here we go... :D


Yep, you're delusional. It's abundantly clear already. You think you're telling the truth by the number of upvotes you have. Holy fucking shit. 


Tell me more doctor. :D


I don't claim to be able to "teach" people anything, dumbass. All I can do is show other people the method I'm using in a way that they can apply. If they follow the strategy, the risk is quite low. 


To be blunt, you're an assumptive douchebag loser. :)
Hey, idiot... I'm in my 50s. I've traded stocks and forex for decades, successfully I might add. I managed to retire from business when I was 40, and have lived off my trading and investments since then. How delusional am I? :)


Throw my pitch at? Tell me something, if I want to help other people do what I'm doing in a way that can only help them become better traders, how is that dangerous? See, here's your problem, other than the fact that you're an assumptive douchebag... you think you know what's going on when you don't. You think I'm some simpleton who jumped on some bandwagon, has a messiah complex and wants to be a hero to feed my own delusions. And quite frankly, it would be hysterically funny if it weren't so sadly delusional. The truth is that you're projecting quite a bit here. You're the loser. You're the one who hasn't been able to successfully trade regardless of what the market is doing, and probably have just lucked out with BTC's price going through the roof. So therefore, you must assume that's what other people are doing. You've tried to trade like the big boys and have failed miserably at it. Therefore, you must declare that all other traders are failing miserably too. 


Again, you have no idea what I'm doing. You have absolutely no fucking clue, yet you think you can make the assumptions that you're making. 
 


I know a lot of traders. Quite a few of the traders I know charge people to teach them what they know, and/or manage their accounts for them. And whatever they charge is worth every penny. 
OTOH, I also know a lot of traders who are complete and total blowhard losers (you know, kinda like you) who think they know what they're doing but don't, and lose everything. They try to save face and make up for it by becoming big-ticket "trading gurus". It never ends well.  


Uh... nope. It's a bit more complex than that. 
Many traders go on to manage huge closed funds and become billionaires doing it. I know a lot of traders who cracked a billion during the dot-com boom (and bust), and then simply walked away. I also know a lot of traders who lost their nut because they didn't walk away when they should have, go figure. 
There are other traders, like me, who set hard limits to their exposure, and don't grow their trading portfiolios exponentially in proportion with their growth rates. I know traders who should easily be making $5-10mil a year with their trading, but are perfectly happy clearing $500k-$1mil a year, and increasing that by 10-20% a year. It all depends on what your goals are, and how you choose to reinvest your profits. 
This may shock you, but not all traders want to make billions of dollars a year. A lot of traders (also like me) like to trade just enough to live the lifestyle they want to live, without having to actually "work" for it. BTC has changed the trading game especially when it comes to forex, because it has brought the entry level down to a point where most people can feasibly get into the game. Before BTC, you had to have at least $25k of starting capital to have even a decent shot. 
 


What an asinine statement. Considering that most traders lose money, regardless of what the market is doing. 


Ok,  see why you're an assumptive moron? Because you think you have to explain this shit to me. 
Hey, idiot... I hold BTC. Through my trading, I've grown my BTC stack while being able to live off the profits. And the way I trade doesn't depend on BTC's price going up. Do you get it yet?


You have absolutely no idea what I did or didn't do while the market was going up, dipshit. 


The irony here, is that you continue to ASSume what I have done or not done to the point of utter stupidity. But tell me again how I'm doing it wrong. :)
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:29:57

Phew! So relieved to hear that... :P


If someone is doing something successfully that's duplicate-able and teachable, and would like to help others do the same thing (at no cost to them whatsoever), how could that be construed to be a bad thing? Explain it to me. :)


I'll do so when I'm good and ready, thanks. I don't need the greenlight from you, or anyone else. :)

@_date: 2018-01-28 04:15:30
How I profit from trading has NOTHING to do with BTC's price going up or down. When it goes up, all that means for me is I get more margin to trade with, which is nice, but I'm not dependent on that. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:46:40
Or, people could just choose to dump them on the exchanges in mass quantities for other crypto. Something tells me that if they're so scared of not being able to "redeem" their "worthless tethers for dollars" directly from Tether (which they don't even promise to do in their own TOS), that they would be getting rid of them on the exchanges any way they can, yesterday. And ultimately the exchanges would stop trading on them out of fear that they'll be left holding the bag after everything melts down. 
Yet, Tether's price is still above $1.00 on Coinmarketcap. 
Hmmmm.... 
PS. I don't own/trade USDT, and don't even give two shits about it. Personally, I think anyone who trades any instrument pegged to the USD is an idiot. Just stating the obvious, that's all. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 07:50:43
Valiant effort, yet a rather lame retort... :D
Get real. The BCC meltdown just happened, people are still shitting themselves over it. Noobs and weak hands panic sell BTC if the wind blows the wrong way, FFS. 
And yet... USDT manages to stay above $1 on the exchanges???
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:07:48
People actually fall for this shit?   
Humanity is doomed.
@_date: 2018-01-28 11:38:11
Just because you haven't been able to figure it out, doesn't mean others among us haven't. :D

Good for us. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:18:39
Zzzzzz.... 
The whole point of Bitcoin is to NOT have to trust anyone or have faith that some entity is telling the truth. So if people are trading with tether, even if to buy Bitcoin or other decentralized crypto, then they are simply in an inescapable zone of self-defeat. 
So yeah, just stop. 
@_date: 2019-07-28 04:45:55
I pay 1 or 2 sats/b all the time. Pay what YOU want to pay, especially if you're not concerned about fast confirmations.
@_date: 2019-07-31 10:46:39
Nah, sorry, I don't waste my time explaining to ignorant dolts. You clearly have no idea of what you're talking about, and the more you post your insanely off-the-mark shit, the more you prove that. 
I will tell you this though, only to make you understand how truly ignorant you really are... 
You don't have to open a channel with a vendor to do a transaction with them you misinformed dimwit. :)
You only have to have an open channel with any node that's funded enough to cover any transaction that you will want to make with your LN wallet. 
The node just needs to be well-connected enough to effectively route your payment to the vendor over the "gasp"... Lightning Network! Crazy huh? :)
Seriously, go do your own research, because you're making an idiot of yourself out here. 
Better yet, go try LN for yourself. Try not to be a dipshit, go through the learning curve to get it set up properly. Again, you clearly have no clue now. You've been inhaling too much ignorant FUD out here, apparently. :)
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:22:12


Nope, just basing my judgments on the evidence presented


Well of course I did. I also checked the data given on this site:  and with that information along with the info from Johoe's, I'm able to make a clear assessment regarding the lowest fee I should pay.


Nope, no mining farm, no transaction accelerator (though I have used them in certain situations), nothing extraordinary done, other than knowing when to make the transaction and calculating the bare minimum fee that it takes to get it to the first confirmation within a desired allotted time. It's not rocket science.
 
Oddly enough, I made a couple of transactions during the same period, and while I had to pay slightly more than my average (around 120 sat/b), I still managed to get them confirmed within 4-5 hours. Imagine that. 
 


Apparently not. I still see people posting out here and making the same stupid mistakes over and over again. Go figure. 
 


So, who's being assumptive? :)
Incidentally, I've started using Segwit over the past month or so, and have dramatically reduced my overall fees even more as a result. 
 


Nah. :)


Ok, if you say so. :)
BTW, there are PLENTY of transactions that have done what I do at the fees I stated that are visible on the blockchain, just seek and ye shall find. 
Sounds to me like you're awfully bitter because apparently you don't even know how to get transactions through without paying unnecessarily high fees that noobs and suckers are paying. Not my problem, and just because you can't seem to figure it out doesn't mean it's a lie. 
As I have previously stated on previous comments, I don't publicize my addresses, u ever. Just how I roll. 
Think I'm lying? That's fine, I seriously couldn't give less of a shit. :)

They can try all they want, it won't work. But what they will do is bring more people aboard BTC, and they soon will figure out that they don't even need these institutions to keep/hold/trade/spend BTC, and they'll drop them like a bad date. Especially after they figure out what kind of fees they're going to be expected to pay for the privilege of being a "customer".

@_date: 2019-07-12 06:38:33
Yeah, he didn't say what you claim. He was merely stating that LN is only ONE OF MANY ways that Bitcoin can be scaled, and he "didn't know if it's the best" yet, simply because there is more work to be done on protocols for routing and efficiency, and because there are multiple other ways to scale Bitcoin, which is the REAL point of that video. 
He says essentially the same thing about LN in the video I posted, and goes on to say that it's the fact that they kept routing protocols simple that will allow developers to innovate LN even further, and make it even better over time. Hello??
So how about you avoid putting words in his mouth, taking shit out of context, and oh yeah... go post your amateur-level FUD somewhere else, good? :)

One thing has nothing to do with the other. Just found it funny how that dipshit thought he can extol the virtues of his wonderful country, but won't even bother saying its name. What the fuck is that?
And what do you think that Venezuelans are doing by utilizing Bitcoin to stay solvent during this fucking meltdown that none of them had anything to do with? That is them taking matters into their own hands. A lot of people think it's just the privileged and middle class (whatever's left of them) Venezuelans who are grabbing Bitcoin, wrong. It's anybody who's got even a few black market dollars stashed away who are tapping into it, understanding that it's the only way that they can fight the deadly hyperinflation that is crippling their country. For many of them, Bitcoin is literally saving their lives and giving them the ability to feed their families. It's easy to armchair quarterback and judge a country when you have no idea of what's really happening, and don't even understand why things have gotten to this point. But to do that just shows that you're an obtuse asshole with zero empathy.

Nobody cares what you think. Lightning's success doesn't require your "faith". Your opinion is obviously ignorant and shortsighted. You're not understanding that Lightning's progress is going to be in leaps and bounds over the coming months and years. It's already easy enough for the early adopters to effectively utilize, as evidenced by the growing list of businesses on directory.btcpayserver.org 


It works fine for virtually any kind of transaction, especially micro ones. You have no idea what you're talking about. 


Yes it does. Again, you have no idea what you're talking about. :)


I'll bet that I travel far more extensively than you, I've already used LN in a variety of situations both in POS and online, and it's worked quite amazingly each and every time. In fact, the need for multiple channels is declining because routing is becoming more efficient. 
You probably should expose yourself to all of the dev activity happening on projects like BTCPay before you make yourself look any more ignorant on Reddit, just sayin'.

The initial number is the average delay of blocks before confirmation. 


Their model is 90% accurate. I can concur with this, as I use this guide before making any transaction (I do around 20 transactions a month). 


Yes they do. Scroll down to the bottom of the page. 
*What does the delay mean?*
*The delay shown here is the predicted number of blocks the transactions will take to confirm. If a transactions are predicted to have a delay between 1-3 blocks, there is a 90% chance that they will be confirmed within that range (around 10 to 30 minutes).*
*Transactions with higher fees will often have 0 delay, which means they will likely be confirmed with the next block (usually around 5-15 minutes).*
*How is the delay predicted?*
*The predictions are based on blockchain data of the last 3 hours, as well as the current pool of unconfirmed transactions (mempool).
First, a likely future mempool and miner behavior is predicted using Monte Carlo simulation. From the simulations, it can be seen how fast transactions with different fees are likely to be included in the upcoming blocks. 
The predicted delay shown here is chosen to represent a 90% confidence interval.*


I use both sites to determine the fee I'll pay. The Johoe's graphs give me a good indication of the level of backed up transactions in a given tier. I'll then use the earn.com chart to determine the best fee tier in relation to that. Works quite nicely, and I get confirmations within a couple of hours 90-95% of the time.
It goes up and down, as I mentioned on another comment, there is definitely spamming going on as part of BTRASH's continuous FUD campaign. With every new block, 2-3000 transactions get confirmed. that's roughly 12-15,000 transactions per hour. 


Uh... no. Again, there's a lot of spamming going on, which is why the mempool is backed up. 


I can assure you, that the mempool is quite busy 24/7. 


I did a transaction yesterday at 70 sat/b, with the mempool at about the same level as it is now. First confirmation within 1 hour, fully confirmed in about 3. FWIW.

Fees are high only for people who are dumb enough to pay them. Get the right wallet, know how and when to make transactions, and you won't have to pay ridiculously high fees. It really is that simple. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:59:09

We're talking about BTC, don't lump its volume in with a boatload of other alt/shitcoins. BTC is doing all the heavy lifting regarding the volume, let's keep it real. 


In 10 years? YEARS??? Try $1T in maybe 10 months, if that. 
For Bitcoin to achieve $1 trillion, it only needs to grab about 12% of gold's total market cap (about $8.5T) . It's at about 5% of that already, and that's not slowing down any time soon.


That's bs. Bitcoin went from under $1000 this time last year to now over 15,000. In LESS than a year. You're ignoring that particular growth spurt in the grand scheme. 


Uh... might? Again, you've clearly not done any real research, analysis or even basic math on any of BTC's volume and activity. 


How do you know what people are thinking?? You want to assume that BTC's market of incoming adopters are only thinking short-term? Wow, you're quite ASSumptive on your arguments, and quite frankly, it's amusing. Maybe you should just not comment on things you know nothing about, perhaps?

BTRASH is not inflationary? Why did they have to adjust their mining difficulty a few weeks ago? It's a centralized shitcoin, and oh yeah, are their shysters definitely trying to sell it hard on Venezuelans.  
And I agree that LTC may be a suitable alternative for them over time, especially when Atomic Swaps become available. But for now, they know and trust BTC because it's proven itself to them, and you can rest assured that they will stick with it for quite some time to come, especially as its value keeps going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:21:26

It is what it is. People say it's fishy while talking out of both sides of their mouths. Until people start reporting that they can't cash out their tethers, and/or it takes a nosedive in the market, quite frankly nobody can say shit about it. Richard Heart explains it in the best way possible right on this video below.  It covers my views and sentiments almost to the tee...
They start talking about it around the 52:00 mark. 
Mind you, I couldn't give two fucks about Tether. But to perpetuate FUD about it and somehow connect it to BTC's price is absolutely ludicrous. Not to mention a big part of the BTRASH FUD playbook.

Dude, I've been to Venezuela several times over the past decade, I know how things work there. The dollar-based black market has been keeping Venezuela afloat for years. Venezuela is a major part of Panama's money laundering activities for the Colombian cartels and even the Russian mafia. There are Venezuelans who do nothing but shuttle between Caracas and Panama City bringing USD, bonds, big-ticket merchandise (to resell) and real estate deeds (which are used for money in Venezuela, believe it or not). 
Guess what they have also been bringing in the last couple of years? That's right... Bitcoin, lots of it. These guys are the major source of Bitcoin coming into the country. Once there, It gets doled out to middlemen and vendors who are already part of the very elaborate black market. And again, they don't care about the fees, because they understand why Bitcoin gives them such an advantage over other alts, and those advantages dwarf the ridiculous "high fee" argument.

Brazil started this year with 7% inflation. As of April of this year, Brazil's inflation rate was just under 5%. While that's much better than it has been in recent years, it's still quite high. 
Any economist will tell you that an inflation rate over 2% is not good for an economy. With high inflation accumulated over years and even decades (like Brazil has) makes recovery only that much more difficult. 
So even at the figure you're citing, which is only for the last couple of months, Brazil still has a long way to go. Brazil's inflation rate inched up to 2.7% in October from 2.54% in Sept despite forecasts that it would keep going down. For the previous couple of years right up to end of 2016, Brazil's inflation rate ranged from 6-11%. 
Brazil still has a ways to go before it can be considered to be in a healthy recovery. BTW, I'm part Brazilian and have siblings, nieces and nephews in Brazil. They tell me all the time how bad things are there economically. 
And yes, Bitcoin is giving them a worthwhile hedge against their declining Reais and high inflation.

In BTC's current state, virtually none. Especially when you compare the risk of loss you would incur if you held a certain amount of money in fiat over a long period of time vs. Bitcoin. Maybe a global thermonuclear war may fuck shit up, but then again, that will fuck up everything. 
As a base currency for Forex trading, it's a wet dream. Deflationary and a consistent long-term valuation increase that puts fiat currencies to shame. It's literally the one thing that's been missing from the puzzle. If Bitcoin existed 10 years ago in the state that is today, I and countless other forex traders I know would billionaires by now, with virtually no risk.  I'm just glad that I was able to tap into it when I did, and am happy to help others do the same thing.

Dude, I just answered this. 


I just spent 5 months in Europe ending in October. Cities I stayed at during the time: 
I used Bitcoin in pretty much every single one of those cities, with the exception of Padova. 


I have yet to pay $20 in fees, ever. The max I've paid so far is $4-5.00 and even then it was worth my while. For smaller purchases, I use a debit card that I load from BTC, it's really not that complicated, and there's nothing ideological about it. And yeah, the VAST majority of business owners I've talked to had
 no intention of cashing my BTC payment out to fiat. I ask about that all time.

Of course I can. There is plenty of evidence supporting my assertion without needing to explain the obvious paradigm shift that you should already know by now on your own. What are you, five? 
Sounds to me like you just prefer to be intellectually lazy and stick to biases, and let people somehow talk you into new concepts. I ain't got time for that shit. As in literally ain't got time for it, my gf and I are catching a flight to Bali in a few hours. 


Well, I said a lot more than that. And I explained my stances in pretty good depth.Not good enough for you? Oh well.  
Suffice to say I've given you a lot more time in this conversation than you've deserved from me. I allowed the discussion to continue because you gave me an inkling of a sign that you would eventually "get it" and figure some shit out on your own. Again, I'm not interested in "selling" you on the merits of BTC and the implications of what is obviously a major paradigm shift happening right under your nose. 


First of all, easy on the "lad" talk. I'm most likely older than you. 
Second of all, I have no time or patience for people who insist on dragging a discussion on past its shelf life, simply because they think they need to be "sold" on a concept that in all honesty, should have sold itself to you years ago. Especially with the rather lofty, condescending attitude you show towards the thundering masses of greedy people who are now trying to jump on your precious BTC bandwagon for unsavory reasons. Damn them! 
Again, get the fuck over yourself, lad.

Are you qualified to make any kind of recommendations to how others should invest or use Bitcoin? What makes you so qualified?


I don't believe in making any long-term predictions for Bitcoin, but I'm quite confident that within 10 years it will have taken more than 50% of gold's market cap, if not more. 




You're making a guess for a year that's already over? Bold. 




We'll see what happens. 


Other than what I just said, no other projections shall be made. I suspect that BTC will be a dominant global currency that will transform economies from top to bottom, but there are many factors that will help or hinder it. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:04:24
Oooh proof. 
So you've proven that you're too much of an idiot to set your own fees. What, a FUDster won't post a transaction with a stupidly high fee to prove a point that he's a lying FUDster? 
Happens every day around here. Get a real wallet, learn how to set fees. Otherwise, stop whining and FUDd'ing about fees. Good?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:49:53

@_date: 2017-12-18 12:32:16

@_date: 2017-12-18 17:50:25


Pure hate? That was nothing. Fuck off ya big baby... :D


Definitely not, never paid anywhere near that. Anyone who does is quite frankly, a sucker. 
And...  why would anyone need to confirm in the next block so badly anyway? The transaction shows up in the receiving wallet a minute or two after sending. What, you can't wait an hour or two for confirmations?  




I do at least one transaction a weekday, sometimes 2-3. I pay an average of 75 sat/b and never wait more than 2-3 hours for confirmation more than 90-95% of the time. The most I've ever paid from my wallet was $5.00 worth of sats. Last transaction I did was yesterday. Cost me 70 sat/b, confirmed in less than 3 hours. 
No txids, I don't publicize my addresses.
You can easily confirm what I'm saying by checking out these two sites and learning how to use the information you get from both to assess what the lowest fee you should pay:
It doesn't take a genius to find the lowest fee tier that will give your transaction a good chance of getting confirmed fairly quickly. No, it won't happen in the next block, but then again, that only matters to people who don't really get how BTC works.

@_date: 2017-12-18 05:46:20


Yeah, you were. 


You didn't trigger anything. I'm just not willing to beat around the bush with people who think that they know more about a topic than who they're talking to based on mere assumption. 


Considering the current intellectual level of this sub at this point in time, you would be correct. 


XAUUSD has been volatile on both poles, due to the volatility of not only gold, but fiat and USD itself. You can go as far back to the beginning of the 20th century to see that gold is quite volatile. I know, shocking. Bitcoin, because it's not reliant on fiat markets like XAU is, doesn't have that problem. That makes a huge difference. 


Of course it's fair. There are not many other stores of value that can even be remotely compared with BTC. Gold is about as close as it gets. And nobody knows better than me the stark difference between the relative volatility between the two. Back in 2011, I essentially had a choice to go big into gold or Bitcoin, I chose gold, and stuck with it a good few years before deciding that BTC would be the better vehicle. Granted, BTC was far from a proven store of value back then as it is now, but the risk/reward for it vs. gold was through the roof, and I didn't see it. Oh well hindsight, 20/20 all that shit... 


Again, stop with the "minute to minute" bullshit, ok? You cease to be taken even remotely seriously when you say that. Nobody gives a rat's ass about minute-to-minute volatility. You are clearly not grasping what I've been trying  to tell you thus far. Stop with the pseudo-intellectual econo-babble, and stop trying to reinforce a case that you are incapable of making, kid. 


Yeah, it "seems" to be working out, to the extent that I plan on teaching other people how to do it for absolutely nothing. 
Hope you get a clue, for your sake.

Good luck with that. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:11:11


Ok, so? I've lurked on this sub for years. Long before I ever bought my first bitcoin. 


None of that matters. Everybody has their own reason to get into BTC. The ones who "get" it are the ones who are fueling the growth. If someone just wants to get into it to make money, so fucking what? Plenty of room for them too. People in inflation-plagued countries like Venezuela, Argentina, Turkey and Zimbabwe among many others are getting into BTC out of sheer necessity and for their own survival. And suffice to say that BTC is saving their asses in ways that you can't even imagine. 


Sorry, but that's a lame assumption on your part. Not everybody is jumping on the BTC bandwagon for the same lame reasons you cite. Do you know how many people have sitting on the fence regarding BTC for YEARS and are just now deciding to jump in? I can assure you, it's many. Dozens of former colleagues of mine who decided BTC wasn't worth it 2-3 years ago are now kicking themselves because they didn't get in when I did and no, it's not just because of the price. It's because they understand now the true advantages of BTC over shitty fiat.  


There will always be suckers looking for the next golden egg. People who are chasing shitcoins and ICOs today are the same kinds of idiots who were chasing penny stocks in the 80's and 90's. 
Again, so fucking what? It doesn't change what BTC is all about. 


It's cynicism blinded by ignorance. You seem to think that everybody needs to be on the same philosophical wavelength as you and have the same motivations as you to get into BTC. Get over yourself and your lofty holier-than-thou attitude maybe? Again, the best thing about BTC is that it really doesn't matter what your motivation is for getting in. If you're a blind opportunist, fine. If you think you're going to make money by shorting Bitcoin, fine. If you just want to buy and HODL, fine. If you want to use it to buy coffee at starbucks and porn online, fine. 


Nope, if you don't get it on your own, I won't force feed it. Sorry, I'm not here to sell you on BTC's merits or its paradigm shift. Everybody I talk to about it, regardless of how long they've been exposed to BTC, has to "get it" on their own. To be honest, I can't understand why you don't get it by now. Maybe you're letting your cynicism get in the way to the point that it's blinding you. Work on that. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:26:13

Thank you for your harrowing fee sob story. You've now proven to me beyond a doubt that you're either an idiot, a lying FUDster, or both. :)


Currently, my average fee is about 75 sat/b (currently around $3.00) have no trouble getting confirmations within 2 hours. The max fee I paid ever was last week 5 whole dollars to move just under .2 btc. Confirmed in less than one hour. It was horrible. :P

@_date: 2017-12-03 10:53:03

@_date: 2017-12-16 09:43:29


That's a bullshit argument. You want to cite a 22% drop of BTCUSD without acknowledging the increase in value in BTC that preceded that drop? Are you fucking kidding? Never mind that Bitcoin increased well over 1500% against the dollar over the last year, right? :D
This is what I mean by nobody caring about short-term volatility other than idiots and crazy day traders. People who use and hold Bitcoin wisely understand when and how to use fiat to leverage it without exposing them to risk or loss. I've moved Bitcoin over to fiat to put on my debit card many times during a "dip", and guess what? I've still ALWAYS been ahead of fiat in the way of purchasing power. 


Newsflash: It's not a speculative asset anymore. It hasn't been for the last 1-2 years or so. And as a currency, it beats fiat hands down no matter how often you have to exchange it to fiat to be able to use it. You're making shit up without any sound mathematical or economic basis, and that's exactly the kind of stuff that confuses people who are trying to learn about the strengths and capabilities of bitcoin. Stop it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:58:54

@_date: 2017-12-13 16:01:11


so not even the founder of bitcoin knows what p2p is then...
Yeah, I read the whitepaper, long before you ever did, I can assure you. :)
Satoshi changed the process and structure of transaction confirmations after he wrote the whitepaper. This was mainly to increase security,  bolster network reliability and eliminate possibility of double spends, and he conceded that it was no longer true p2p due to those devs. He covers this in pretty good depth in his followup posts on Bitcointalk. May wanna read up so you can catch up with the rest of us. 


That's your problem, not mine. On the comments' section alone of the 99bitcoins link I gave you, there are literally HUNDREDS of other sites that were added by readers. There are almost 10k listed on SpendBitcoins.com and yet you continue whining and moaning,because you think I should do the sifting for you beyond what I gave you. Yeah right, grow the fuck up. 


You're right, it's not that hard, so don't be lazy, and just admit that I more than met your request. You asked for 3 or 5 and I gave you access to tens of thousands. Case Closed. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:32:41


Zzzzzz.... he concedes several times that while it's still theoretically p2p, it's not true p2p due to the fact that the nodes and miners are engaged in the confirmation process. But keep splitting hairs and raising red herrings if you must. It's all you have done thus far in this discussion.


that's my point
Oh, I can name you far more than that, and I have. So no, you haven't made a point. You're whining because I gave you too many sites that you yourself have to sift through.

I do the same thing. The debit card is used to complete the "last mile" of the transaction. It allows me to leverage fiat to my advantage, by being able to buy what I want to buy with BTC, anytime, anywhere. It works beautifully for me as a real-world solution, and it saves me tons of fees and even more when inflation is accounted for. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:35:26

Um yeah, I have two debit cards, dipshit. One that I load with BTC, and one that I load with fiat exchanged from BTC. Both have their advantages depending on where I am. See, when I'm traveling abroad (which is pretty much always), I get charged a 3% currency exchange fee on my BTC - loaded debit card if I have to exchange to a different currency other than EUR to make a transaction. 
My other card has no currency exchange fee, so I use that one when I'm abroad. 
The result? I save hundreds of dollars a year in unnecessary currency exchange fees. So yeah, tell me again, a full-time trader who lives off of what he makes with BTC, how "seriously" you won't take what I say. Because oh ouch... :D


Funny, it's not about you either. :)
And that's not what I'm doing, dipshit. Calling out stupidity, intellectual dishonesty, misrepresentation and dare I say it... FUD out here has nothing to do with "wanking my ego". It has everything to do with giving people reading shit posted by whiners/FUDsters like you out here a different take or perspective that's backed up by facts and/or personal experience. Got a problem with that? Think I fucking care? :)


Says the whining, blathering idiot who cries incessantly about fees, confirmation times, and god knows what else. Hey dipshit, using fiat for the "last mile" of a transaction when it's to my advantage isn't a dumbass move. It's a smart move, that has saved me a lot of money over the last couple of years. So pardon me when I tell you again, go fuck yourself. I know how to do math, and I understand that utilizing existing legacy systems when it's to my advantage is smart, not stupid. 
If that's "toxic" then guilty as charged.  I can live with that. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:58:53

It's minimal for me, the longest I'm holding any fiat on my card's balance is maybe 2-3 weeks. And yeah, as a trader, I crunch the numbers on this, I never lose value to the fiat. Ever. 


Bullshit, in the long-term, Bitcoin is the LEAST VOLATILE currency out there. Don't take my word for it, check the monthly charts of BTCUSD and compare it to all the major currency pairs for the same time period. Bitcoin's volatility in comparison to fiat is NIL. 


Nobody cares about minute-to-minute fluctuation. Except for crazy day traders, and idiots who have no idea how economics and currencies even work. It's the LONG term valuation and yes... deflationary structure of Bitcoin, that makes ALL the difference. 


ANY currency for any country whose inflation is above 2% a year essentially SUCKS. Whether it's the Turkish Lira, where the annual inflation is currently about 15%, Venezuela, whose inflation is literally OFF THE FUCKING charts, or Zimbabwe, where they essentially use their money for toilet paper and fishwrap these days, thanks to BTC. Let's not beat around the bush, ALL fiat currency sucks, except for perhaps the NOK and CHF, that are the only two currencies who seem to be able to beat inflation over the long term.

I suspect that there are many more like me, who will be glad to dole small pittances of BTC to the market at times that will provide at least some supply to fill the growing, hungry demand. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:54:48

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:56:48


Yes, and it was a hilarious one at that. Also considering the fact that you decided on which coin to invest based on the reddit sub you liked better rather than the fundamentals and facts behind each coin. That makes it all the more hilarious, sorry. Also basing your decision on the current prices of both coins, rather than its future growth prospects, also makes it all even more hilarious. 


You really should have done more objective research. ETH will never achieve the critical mass and network effect that BTC has. Sure, it currently has its uses/advantages for certain applications and smart contracts, but BTC will also have them in the near future, so its specialty will be far less unique. 


And that's... hilarious. :)


BTC also has value for its system of computations, sorry you missed that. And BTC is also a true, decentralized blockchain, ... sorry to tell you... ETH isn't. 


If you think it's unpopular, it's because it's hilariously stupid. Sorry to be so blunt about it, but you really should have kept these thoughts to yourself. You made your choices on entirely the wrong criteria, and your defenses for your choices now only make things that much more hilarious, and a tad embarrassing for you. 
But hey good luck with your ETH investment, let's see how it measures up to BTC one year from now.

This is nothing. It's a drop in the bucket. BTC's market share is still a tiny sliver of gold and other classic stores of value/asset classes. Notice that gold's price is tanking, while BTC's is going up.  Coincidence? Yeah, right.

It's established itself as a sound, deflationary store of value and currency, which many people are using to hedge themselves against shitty fiat currency which has proven itself to be a complete sham. Institutional money has seen the writing on the wall, and are now coming in droves. Tech innovations like LN and Segwit will dramatically reduce fees while improving performance of the network. The current market cap is a tiny sliver of gold's and a lot of money that used to be in gold is shifting over to BTC. This is literally just scratching the surface of its market potential. People who did their research and analyzed the data pretty much saw it coming, along with everything else that's just around the corner.
What else do you need to know?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:18:31
Oh yeah... that's perfect. :D
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:11:21


Segwit was just released earlier this year. Its adoption was rather clusterfucked by the whole Segwit2X thing that certain parties and companies tried to impose on the rest of BTC, remember that shit? Well, that bullshit set the process back a bit. Now that it's a dead issue, everybody can focus on implementing the original Segwit plan that everybody originally agreed to work with in the first place. 


That's bullshit, and you haven't made a point. Segwit is indeed going to get implemented steadily but surely. Once Core releases 0.16, things will happen much faster.
 


Waaaaaaa!!! Blocks full, fees high.... waaaaaaaa
Grow the fuck up. I use BTC almost every single day. I manage to get transactions confirmed within a couple of hours for an average of 75 sat/b . Anyone who pays more than that is a sucker, an idiot, or a totally uninformed newbie. And honestly, I have no patience for all the incessant bitching and moaning. Go use Paypal or Western Union for fuck's sake. :D


And again, that's bullshit. LN has already tested live on BTC's mainnet. I watched a realtime live video of a LN transaction test last week. 
Now, we're waiting on back-end and client-side apps/tools to get rolled out by the dev community. Then, yep, another round of beta testing, wait for some lightning nodes to go live (FYI: I plan on setting up a lightning node, so I'm keeping up with all this). 
Segwit will also get adopted in leaps and bounds. More wallets and more exchanges will go live with it in the coming months. 
But keep crying about no relief in sight if you must, just don't do it here. 
Fucking babies, geez... :D

And yeah, most of the time. If you know how to interpret that chart and correlate it to the information you get off these charts:
... if you are intellectually capable, you'll figure out how to set the lowest possible viable fee that will allow your transaction to get confirmed in a reasonable time (usually a couple of hours more than 90% of the time in my experience), no matter how backed up the mempool is. 
If not, no problem. Keep paying and complaining about ridiculously high fees, nobody cares. :)

Um, Bitcoin IS everywhere. It's just not "everywhere" the way that YOU think it should be. Bitcoin has proven to have many uses, and yes... eventually you'll be able to buy coffee with it, so people like you can finally shut up  about it. 
And sorry, Bitcoin is NOT complicated. The learning curve is virtually nil. Once you understand the concept of copying and/or scanning an address to send money anywhere you want, pressing "send" and entering your password or key, that's pretty much all anyone needs to know to use it. 
And don't worry, Bitcoin is becoming less complicated by the day. Stop your whining.

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:05:13
At the time I made that particular transaction, my Electrum wallet had the lowest fee set to 05 sat/b, I set it to 10 sat/b (I usually go for 10-30 sat/b, depending on who I'm sending to, or what it's for) and it went through and confirmed, no problem. At the time, the mempool was +50k. First confirmation in about 12 minutes, six confirms within an hour. 
This is usually the case for me with the mempool at this level or lower. When it's higher, it typically takes about 2-3 hours for full confirmation more than 95% of the time. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:53:54
The only people who pay over the median transaction fee are suckers, newbies and people with shitty wallets. The rest of us, not so much. My average fee is still right around $3.00 per transaction (around 75 sat/b), and I almost always get full confirmation within 2 hours. And that's with the mempool where it is right now, and even when it was higher.
Crazy, huh?
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:41:25
Nah, I'd rather eat razor blades. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:47:16
So, don't pay 50 sat/b when the mempool is backed up maybe? I pay an average of 70 sat/b and get confirmations within a few hours. The longest it took to get 6 confirmations was 12 hours. 
Sounds like you need to start reading and stop babbling FUD bullshit.

Merchant adoption was slow because back then people weren't using it or even trying to use it. Now with more mass adoption businesses who start taking BTC will actually see a rising percentage of sales paid with them. Most businesses I talk to tell me that their sales via BTC only amount to a small percentage of their overall sales, but that percentage creeps up a bit each month. 


You don't see them? You don't think that the business is including that percentage in their prices? If not, then you are even more ignorant than I thought. :)


You pay for all that whether you know it or not. Banks aren't stupid. They know how to make all those benefits appear to be "free" or "earned" while you pay. Again, you don't even realize that you're paying that 2-5% that merchants pay to take your card. Nevermind all the other fees, charges, surcharges, currency exchange fees, and other ways that they jack you. As for buyer protections, how many times have you ever had to dispute a charge? I can count how many I've done on maybe one hand. Now ask me how many times I've had to counter fraudulent charge attempts and security bullshit. 


Uh... it's already happening. Keep up. 


Only if you don't know what you're doing. :)


Well both Square and Revolut have taken on Bitcoin for their apps, and you can rest assured that many others will follow suit. That's how it always goes, one or two companies lead the way, everybody else follows pretty quickly after that. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:31:07
Why not just buy the house with BTC? As for "exit strategy", there's literally nothing to exit too. It's pointless and stupid to cash out of BTC to inflationary, crappy fiat currency that will just degrade in value each and every year. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:11:28


He's been right about a lot of stuff so far. More than you can say. :)
And yeah, what he's saying here is pretty much my take on it. I was thinking this before I ever saw him say it on the video. 


It also isn't rational to assume that just because you don't fully understand a particular concept or know every detail about it, that it's automatically shady. Again, I don't give a rat's ass about Tether. But I also understand that any effort to connect it with BTC and its price is utterly ludicrous. It's clear to me that it's just part of a massive FUD campaign, so no quarter given. 
Again, until people start complaining that they can't convert/cash out their tethers, any problem or risk is strictly hypothetical and unproven. When Tether's price nosedives below $1.00, that will be a good indicator to me that there's a problem, and guess what? It will still be irrelevant to BTC's overall health. 


So... don't use or trade on Bitfinex. Problem solved, right? Anybody else who does by now understands any risk they're undertaking by doing so. Anyone who leaves money on ANY exchange is just asking for trouble anyway.

@_date: 2017-12-03 09:10:11
Outstanding piece. It resonates clearly with everything I believe about Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Only thing I disagree with you on is the comparison of BTC's growth to the dot-com bubble. I was in the thick of the dot-com boom, and I remember saying to myself that it was all going to meltdown long before it happened, and anyone even mentioned that it would happen. In fact, I continually turned down dot-com companies who were eager to buy out my company with their stock. I must have said no a dozen times.
Why? Because over 90% of the companies that were getting funded with VC's and IPO capital were doomed from the start. They had no idea how they were going to make money, couldn't create any value, and were literally just an "idea" to apply something online without thinking it through. It was all mere speculation and yes... "stupid money" that fueled the dot-com boom. Bitcoin on the other hand, as clearly covered in your article doesn't have that problem. The value is self-evident, its power is self-evident, and yes... its current price has little correlation to any of that. As more and more people come to understand all this in the future, that will only fuel its growth. The crashes of its history notwithstanding, I believe that there is an entirely new dynamic at work here, and up is the only real direction that it can go. There is no turning back now. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:22:14

Blocks are still going to be coming along about every 10 minutes average. BTC is currently ahead on their averages by about 2 blocks per hour. 
And sorry, the current earn.com chart counters what you're saying. Transactions @ 71-90 sat/b are experiencing an average of 4 blocks for initial confirmation (within 1 hour).

By all accounts, Brazil still has a long way to go to recover from its high inflation for the last several years before it can be considered recovered in any real sense. 
High/hyperinflation has been a problem in Brazil for a very LONG time. As long as I can remember, that's for sure. 
Just look at all the new money they had to issue over the last few decades alone because of it. The Cruzeiro, "New" Cruzeiro, Cruzado, and now the Real.  All anybody needs to know about Brazil's historical inflation problem. 
BTW, the US's inflation rate this year is even higher than Brazil's (3.10%) if that makes you feel any better.

Hey "CryptoKid", I know far more about trading than you EVER will. Don't even attempt to lecture me about what I know or don't know, that will just make you look like more of a patronizing idiot than you already do. 
BTW, that was a lousy retort to my comment, especially considering the idiotic comment by you that I was replying to. Try harder, or don't bother. 


It's not a poor store of value, dummy.  You repeating that doesn't make it so. BTC's historical activity readily defies your bogus argument. There's absolutely nothing speculative about sticking $1 into BTC to be a store of value any more than just keeping it in a fiat state or in gold. In fact, keeping $1 in a fiat state is FAR more detrimental because it then becomes subject to inflation and manipulation by a central bank/government. 
As for "volatility", let me tell you something about BTC's volatility as a forex trader with over 20+ years experience in the markets. Compared to the long-term volatility of all the major currency pairs on the forex market, BTCUSD is the LEAST volatile of the bunch. And yeah, nobody gives a flying fuck about "minute to minute" volatility, Kiddyboy. Suffice to say at least during BTC's lifetime, its long-term non-volatility kicks the shit out of its closes "store of value" competition, gold. 
Don't believe me? 
See for yourself. Compare any major currency pairs, including XAUUSD (that's gold to USD for the finance-illiterate) monthly chart over the last 8+ years to BTCUSD. Don't worry, I only see those charts everyday since I'm a full-time trader, I won't be surprised at what you see.  
One more thing, It doesn't matter to me whether BTC's price goes up or down, I make money from it in any case, because I use it as my base currency for trading forex pairs. But trust me when I tell you, this price rise hasn't even scratched the surface of BTC's market cap potential. Once it gets to maybe 25% of gold's market cap, then we'll talk. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:34:11
Yeah... right... :D
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:37:30


You haven't really made a point. Aroused and excited? Nah. Just having fun toying with the clueless idiots around here. Don't flatter yourself, dipshit. :)


I know what I pay dumbass. I'm a full-time trader, I know all my costs and overhead. My BTC fees amount to nothing in the grand scheme of things. I do an average of 25 transactions a month, and my average fee is currently right currently around 75 sat/b @ 220bytes = .165 mbtc, which is currently worth about $2.97 . Average confirmation time has been right around 2-3 hours, with the longest one taking about 12 hours to fully confirm (and nobody in the transaction even cared that it took that long, crazy huh?). 
That's just in the last 1-2 weeks mind you. 
This makes my fees currently around $74 a month, or $2.47 a day. Last month or so, it was about half that. 
I know... ouch. Woe is me.  :D 
Sorry, no txids, I don't publicly advertise my addresses in any way, shape or form. 


Considering that BTC has appreciated in value by well over 1500% since I first bought it, I'm not going to bitch and moan about relative pennies.Only idiots do that. And I'm also not going to put my money into a silly shitcoin that nobody even cares about just because I think I might save a buck in fees. 
This is especially true now since I can leverage my costs even further with Segwit (which I have only recently started using with a new Electrum wallet, and absolutely LOVE), Litecoin (once atomic swaps are live, paying BTC/LTC will be a total breeze and transaction fees will be even more ridiculously cheap), and LN (which will make smaller payments cheaper and faster), which is already being used. I'm actually planning on setting up an Lightning node on a Linux VPS I have running. 
Since I see how much I'm saving in bank fees, credit card fees, currency exchange fees and other incidentals that I would be paying if I were still using fiat to pay for the same shit, this is all one big no-brainer. 


Oh, thanks for the enlightening chart links, I only use them everyday. :D 
And hey, dumbass, only idiots pay that. :D
I did my last transaction two days ago and it cost me a whole $5.00 to move .18 BTC. The mempool at the time about 130k, and it fully confirmed within 2 hours. First confirmation rolled in within 15 minutes. Shocking. :P


Right, and if you think you have to pay that to get a transaction through, that only makes you an even bigger FUDster idiot than I originally thought. :)


I love it when people who have no idea what they're talking about try to tell people that something that they're using as a currency isn't a currency.  Hilarious. :D
And for fuck's sake, learn how to fucking spell and write. Hard for anyone to take you seriously when you write like a fucking pre-schooler. 


Do you mean "wherever"? 
And yeah I do, every day. My debit card helps me do that. :)


Sorry... but.... 
Money is so much better??? Omg, I thought I was going to pass out laughing. Seriously. That was hysterical. 


Dude, stop. You're killing me. :D
BTW, if you ever want to be taken even remotely seriously in any kind of debate, here's some advice, don't EVER use Wikipedia as a source. Ever. 
Ever. :)


Wow, did you fail remedial reading and writing? You're pathetic. 
And uh... no. Even Wall St agrees that Bitcoin is quite the store of value and has been steadily eroding Gold's market cap (you know that thousands of years old store of value?) at a rapidly-increasing clip. 


Yeah, I'm the narrow-minded one in this discussion. :D
You're quite intellectually-inept, too, that's for sure. 


Calling you out on your bullshit and stating facts and my own experiences doesn't amount to cheerleading. I'm quite happy about what BTC is doing for me and my significant other, and see its future potential clearly. If you don't, it's because you're biased and yeah... stupid. That's not my problem, but don't expect to not have it called out when you post stupid drivel on this sub. Mmmkay?
And yeah, work on your writing and spelling skills. I'm fucking embarrassed for you. 


It can be many things to many people. Anybody who simply moves some of their cash into Bitcoin and does absolutely nothing with it stands to benefit from that alone over the long term. People who use it as a currency like it's being used over 400,000 times per day as such for whatever reason, are benefiting from it as well. You don't get to dictate what Bitcoin is or isn't, or should be or shouldn't be to other people. Just because you think that you can whine about fees, and tout some fake shitcoin as a better alternative (let's face it, that's all you're really doing here) doesn't give you any level of authority. Especially since you write and debate like a fucking five year old. 


Wow... that was taken right out of the Ver/BTRASH FUD playbook. *slow clap* :D
And don't tell me what my intentions are or aren't you lame ass, idiotic FUDster. 


It is that, and much more than that. And no, BTRASH will never supplant or top BTC, no matter how much you and your FUDster cadre try. :)


Ah... there you go flattering yourself again.... :D 
Hey... idiot... this is FUN for me. Calling you out on your very obvious canned FUD antics, despite your inability to write or say things coherently, has been incredibly entertaining. :D

You actually talked about both Segwit AND LN, I responded to both points. 


there is no incentive for users to use it if the network isn't useful because its too small or lacks services and there is no incentive for service providers to adopt it if there are no users Its a completely valid concern. Thats my point.
And again, you haven't made a point. You're making a stupid assumption based on nothing. No incentive??? Are you fucking out of your mind? You do realize that LN is structured to be pay those who implement it, right? Why do you think I'm going to set up a node? Do you know anything about LN? Apparently not. 
As for Segwit, there is plenty of incentive for everybody, because service providers don't give a shit about fees paid to miners.  Miners will get less fees per transaction, but will be able to fit more transactions into a block. So essentially they benefit that way, and more transactions get processed in less time. It's a win-win-win situation essentially for all parties involved. 
So, what are you going to whine about now?

More red herring bullshit. Fail. 


I gave you a list of literally hundreds of businesses. You pick out a handful that don't meet your "criteria" and then want to say that there aren't ANY businesses listed on those three lists that take Bitcoin, and instead will want to raise bullshit red herrings with the ones that don't for whatever reason. Again... FAIL. 


Technically, it's not "peer to peer", see how little you know about it? Because a transaction requires being added to blocks and confirmed via nodes and other miners defeats that definition. It's quasi p2p, but that's about it. 


It isn't, that's why I gave you three lists' worth. You just seem to want to harp about the ones that don't meet the criteria rather than accept and acknowledge the ones that do. Again, just own up.

It's not nearly the "problem" that whiners and FUDsters on Reddit make it out to be. Newbies and suckers get taken advantage of no matter how big or small the mempool is. Future tech implementations will just make BTC better, faster and cheaper.

You're an idiot. BTC hasn't even gotten started yet. It's not about getting rich, dumbass. It's about breaking free from a flawed financial system and currency that essentially eats working-class people alive over time. 
But hey, whatever, it's fine. BTC, and we, will do just fine without you. 
Don't bother posting on this sub anymore. Go away.

Oh come on, you have GOT to be kidding me. :D
There are literally THOUSANDS of SMB companies that run their online stores using apps like GoUrl and several to accept BTC and other cryptos on the fly with full integration to stores running on WooCommerce, WP and even Shopify (not all stores on Shopify that take BTC use Bitpay).  They allow payment directly to any wallet the business specifies.
There are other services like GoCoin and Coingate that gives you the option to receive BTC/LTC directly, or to exchange to fiat. 
Here are several lists of business, sites and companies that all take Bitcoin:
FYI: Every time I arrive in a new city/country, I can usually find any businesses/companies that take Bitcoin for anything I may need while I'm there with a few minutes of google searches. Sure, there have been a few places where no businesses that take BTC directly were to be had, but it's still no problem because I have a debit card that I load with BTC, so problem solved at least for me. It really is not a big deal.

Mining is not cheap, miners are entitled to be paid for what they do to maintain the ecosystem. 
You have the option to set whatever fee you want to pay on a sliding scale based on the size of the mempool and the wallet you choose to use. If all that's not good enough for you, fine. 
You clearly don't get it, so stick to banks or some shitcoin that promises to save you a couple of cents, because in all honesty, nobody cares.

I don't want, nor need your money, oh pathetic FUDster troll loser newbie-boy. 
But it's funny, I just answered another FUDster dipshit earlier tonight on this particular topic. Allow me to copy and paste:
"I know what I pay dumbass. I'm a full-time trader, I know all my costs and overhead. My BTC fees amount to nothing in the grand scheme of things. I do an average of 25 transactions a month, and my average fee is currently right currently around 75 sat/b @ 220bytes = .165 mbtc, which is currently worth about $2.97 . Average confirmation time has been right around 2-3 hours, with the longest one taking about 12 hours to fully confirm (and nobody in the transaction even cared that it took that long, crazy huh?).
That's just in the last 1-2 weeks mind you.
This makes my fees currently around $74 a month, or $2.47 a day. Last month or so, it was about half that.
I know... ouch. Woe is me. :D"
Oh btw, that average just ticked up a bit since I originally, considering that BTC is now around $19k. So that makes my average cost per transaction now around $3.09. Just keepin' shit real. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:54:52

Calling out your complaining of Bitcoin due to your own ignorance isn't trashing you. Even if I did it twice. Maybe you should spend more time reading up on how to use Bitcoin efficiently, and less time on this sub whining, just a thought. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:59:11
You've been using BTC for "a long time" and you don't even know how to manage fees? 
You've been using BTC for "a long time" and you don't even know that sending from Coinbase (instead of GDAX) is utterly STUPID??
And then on top of that, you think that you can impose your view of what BTC is on other people??? 
Whatever. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:24:40

Only one guy in the conversation knows anything about Bitcoin. Fucking insane. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:32:37


Referring to people who say and do the same shit that FUDsters and concern trolls do out here all day long is what it is. Don't want to be lumped in with FUDsters? Don't perpetuate bullshit FUD out here, it's that simple. 


It will NEVER be perfect. It doesn't have to be. The fact that it continues to improve and innovate since its humble beginnings is evidence enough of BTC's abilities. Playing armchair critic and letting people incessantly whine unchecked about bullshit like high fees for measly transactions detracts from the far more important points worth discussing. 


You mean "its flaws"? And if you want to be part of the solution, then you're in the wrong fucking place anyway. Go join in on Core's Github and make notes, recommendations and dare I say, contribute code to the effort if you're a dev. That's how you HELP improve it, not by whining out here about endless childish bullshit. That at the end of the day, does nothing contribute to the ridiculous FUD cloud and wastes ridiculous amounts of time.
 


It's not about being "fanatics", it's about focusing on productive discussion and doing it in the right place. I already told you where you can go "contribute" to BTC's improvement. Go do it where it counts. Whining and pissing vinegar out here is what crybabies and FUDsters do out here to insert seeds of doubt and worry into other people. As a full-time trader who has come to know BTC and cryptos fairly inside and out over the past few years, I've decided that the rest of us need to counter that horseshit head on, not coddle and cater to it. 
Got a problem with that? Too fucking bad. This isn't pre-school. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:57:54

Oh yeah, now you're going to be ambiguous about what shitcoins you do support? 
And we've already established that you're the one who's being ridiculously ASSumptive, let's just clear that up right now. :)


Raise a valid point, back it up with facts and logic, and I'll see what I can do. Keep raising classic points from the BTRASH FUD playbook and well... nah. All bets are off. 


I think you meant "viable". ?
And... um... the facts speak for themselves. The fact that Bitcoin is currently being used in  well over 400,000 transactions per DAY...
...and keeps rising steadily is all anybody needs to know. Despite the fees bullshit, the mempool spamming (which we all know who's behind that), the endless FUD, price keeps going up, and usage keeps going up. 
Now just wait until Segwit gets fully adopted (live now, and being implemented more and more by the day), LN goes online (already active on mainnet) and atomic swaps become a thing, and it's just going to be absolutely devastating, and in a good way. :D
Oh yeah, just one more thing. Adoption is steadily increasing EXPONENTIALLY. 
Coinbase ALONE has added almost 6 million new accounts just this year. It took them 3 years to get to 6 million. Ooops! :D 
What else you got, obtuse dipshit?

@_date: 2018-09-04 14:46:40


That's ok, I laughed even more at you. Too bad you're not living off your profits from your trading. Doesn't mean that others don't. :)


Oh... yes I can. :)
I've been to over 70+ countries over the last 15 years, dipshit. Back in the early days of Bitcoin, nobody, and I mean... NOBODY outside of tech nerd circles and the dark web were talking about it, let alone "using" it. I saw that change over the years on a nice steady curve, which has only gotten steeper the last few years. The presence and availability of local bitcoin exchanges, the increasing activity on sites like Paxful and LocalBitcoins.com, not to mention the ever-increasing of BTM's sprouting all over the world is all the evidence you need that Bitcoin is indeed "global". 
Look at the level of usage and trading in countries whose crappy fiat has tanked due to hyperinflation, and you see even more use cases. Venezuela, Argentina, Greece and Zimbabwe prove that point many times over. 
Nowadays, I not only see Bitcoin's growing presence in well over 90% of the countries, its visibility continues to sprout everywhere. That's only going to keep happening exponentially. 


Bla bla bla, it's really not that complicated to begin with. 
The younger generations are easily figuring it out big time, as will every generation that follows them. 
It was recently reported that almost 20% of US college students hold Bitcoin and/or other cryptocurrency, which is almost double from the year before. In Asian countries, EVERYBODY knows about and uses Bitcoin at some level, at the very least as a store of value. 
Let's not even mention Latin America, Africa and the rest of the developing world. The remittance industry is taking a major hit because more and more migrant workers are sending money back home via Bitcoin vs. Western Union or Moneygram and saving on crazy fees and documentation. That's only going to continue to increase as well. 


Uh, that wasn't weak, dumbass. :)
Despite its steady growth and establishing presence, Bitcoin is still in early adoption phase, but that's quickly evolving.
Apps are getting easier to use, Lightning Network will make it an absolute breeze for people to make micropayments with just a mere scan from their phones. When business owners realize that they can save 2-5% of their gross sales that they're pissing away on merchant credit/debit card merchant fees, they're going to be all over that, they'd be absolutely stupid not to. As will consumers when they realize that they no longer need a bank or intermediary party to make payments easy and convenient. 
LN's growing like a wildfire on meth, and once it hits that inevitable critical mass, it's going to fucking explode, and make paying via cash and/or debit cards a total fucking joke. 


So am I, I have a few debit cards that do just fine for me for that "last mile" of any bitcoin-sourced transaction that I need to make. Eventually I won't even need those anymore. 
And again, people who "get" Bitcoin don't give a rat's ass about whether or not they're ever going to be able to buy coffee with it at Starbucks (which incidentally, they will once BAKKT goes live with their system). 
You clearly still don't get it, yet here you are whining about stupid shit.

You don't understand either basic economics or history. Reagan tried that shit, it failed miserably. Even to the point where he figured that taxes needed to be raised. 
GWB squandered a budget surplus his administration inherited and turned it into a spiraling debt with his bullshit tax cuts and financing of two wars on the national credit card, all because he wouldn't raise taxes on the rich or corporations to help pay for them. 
Those are all facts, btw.

Bullshit. 25??  You cited maybe 4 or 5 that didn't meet your criteria (or were "bogus"), rather than acknowledge the far more numerous legit entries, then you tried to shift the onus on me. Doesn't work that way. I already know that there are well over the 3 or 5 (as in THOUSANDS more) sites that you requested from me listed on those resources. 
You can't handle eating your words, so you now you want to make it sound like I'm the one who failed. 
And yeah... FAIL. :)






No, sorry, doesn't work that way. 
You're the one that made the bullshit claim that I couldn't give you 3 or 5 small (then medium) businesses that accept Bitcoin directly. Then you get hit with a tidal wave of overwhelming evidence proving beyond a doubt that I exceeded your number by far. 
Now... you want to act like it's my job to sift through that mountain of sites to find the sites that meet your criteria. 
Wrong, you've been given the resources, go find them yourself.

Oh come on man yourself. It's not my fault you choose to remain ignorant on this topic. 


Actually, ALL intra-exchange transactions take place off chain. The only transactions that take place ON-chain are BTC deposits and withdrawals, that's it. Everything you do within the exchange happens within their own system, get it yet?




And of course, your understanding is ridiculously flawed. Exchanges do charge a nominal fee per withdrawal that covers their overhead when it comes to transactions. They also know how to leverage transaction fees to their advantage, by handling bulk transactions in batches. The higher the batch of transactions they handle at one time, the lower the cost PER transaction. It's called the economies of scale.


It's actually quite a dumb question, to be honest. It only showed that you don't even have a rudimentary understanding of how exchanges function. You exhibited your sheer laziness, by posting this ridiculous question, rather than just take a couple of minutes and do some googling. What, you don't think we all have better things to discuss than kindergarten-level exchange basics???  


Yeah, here's my idea. Do some damn research before you post idiotic questions, ok?


Thanks for stating the obvious. 


Great, welcome. Now start researching, educating yourself and refrain from posting ignorant/uneducated questions out here, ok? 




No, you came off incredibly ignorant.

Should have bought more than $5. 




Use its exchange GDAX, you'll pay a much lower fee, if any. 


Yes. Get a real wallet that allows you to control the fees you pay. Use Coinbase/GDAX strictly to buy BTC, and move it with GDAX. 


Nope, you can pay lower fees, and it may take a bit longer to confirm, but it works fine. I have never paid more than $5 max, even with the mempool this backed up. I usually pay around .60-$2. Don't be a gullible sucker, and you won't have to either. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:31:34


This coming from a guy who can't make a single coherent argument to save his life. :D


Actually, I'm calling you out on your obvious inability to coherently communicate while calling you out on your bullshit. I can multi-task that way,  pretty amazing stuff. :)


Don't confuse passion with anger. ;)


Calling out an obvious idiot and their obvious idiocy isn't defamation. If I call your bullshit out with facts and relevant substantial data while calling you an idiot, it's not ad hominem. 


Oh, I'm grown up. And I'm too old to give a shit about what idiots like you think about people like me. :)
Come back when you can write and debate coherently, and when you can do so on facts without bias and a FUD agenda. 


Yeah, that was just meaningless babble. Literally made no sense whatsoever. 


See how stupid you are? I haven't "bought" bitcoin in well over a year. Haven't had to, I earn profits from my base capital, which has grown quite nicely, thanks. I use Bitcoin to transact business, purchase services and products, pay rent, and all my usual expenses. Yet, you want to tell me that I don't "use" Bitcoin? Yep, you're a fucking clueless FUDster idiot, and you hate that you've been outed. :) 


I understand it better than you do, that much is obvious. :D


I know what a store of value is without needing Wikipedia. See, you're such a patronizing pseudo-intellectual plebe, that you still think that you can gain a higher ground in this debate. You still don't even realize that you have talked yourself into a proverbial corner. 


Come on, you're projecting again. :)


That was the max that I ever paid, and it was worth every single penny, because you see unlike you, I'm not an idiot. I can do math. :)


Sure, to try to use a currency that nobody gives a shit about, and never will. Good luck with that. Especially after January when Coinbase releases BTRASH to everyone and it gets majorly dumped. Oh yeah, that's gonna be fun to watch. :D

Just used it yesterday to put a deposit on a yacht charter I'm doing in Croatia next summer. 
So am I crazy? Am I the only one doing all this? And why did you delete your whiny little retort that I was responding to with this particular reply? :)

@_date: 2017-12-14 06:31:18
I'm not in denial, just someone who uses BTC everyday and knows what he's talking about. 
Calling you out on your FUD stupidity is what it is. You spout false shit, you're going to get called out on it. This FUD is all part of the concerted effort (which includes spamming the mempool) to take down BTC. It obviously doesn't work, but that doesn't seem to stop you idiots. 
Fuck off. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:00:28
It's more of a sign that lots of new money is pouring in, and day traders are taking advantage than anything else.  And yeah, for BTC, this kind of movement is nothing out of the ordinary. This price activity doesn't change the fact that it's the first and only truly decentralized and deflationary currency, as well as a major asset class. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:26:08
he kept referring to bitcoin as a p2p system after bitcoin went live. He did so on bitcointalk aswell but the website it currently down for me.
you are obviously trolling.
Nope, just calling it like it is. Once other parties get involved in the transaction, it's no longer "true" peer to peer. It really is as simple as that, and Satoshi did acknowledge this after writing the whitepaper.  Incidentally, the whitepaper isn't an infallible holy scripture or anything, there are many things that have deviated in BTC since it was written. I know, shocking. Nice try with the trolling thing, though. :)


name me 5 URLs or don't even reply anymore
Yet even more reason for you to not be lazy. You keep replying to me because you can't accept that you've been nailed to the wall with your stupidity. Stop replying to me, go do some due diligence with the ample information I've provided and yeah... grow the fuck up and find your own URLs.

See how stupid you are? You seem to think that my life and success are somehow tied to BTC's price. It's not. I live on the Bitcoin I make as profit from my trading, it doesn't matter whether the price of BTC is up or down, I still make profit.


Of course you'll say that, you're an idiot. You have no idea of what is happening, and now you're just going to claim that I haven't made a case. 
Hey dumbass, YOU haven't made a case. I've only stated facts and educated opinions. 


Not an insult if it's true. You're an idiot. To the point that you didn't even know what "fiat" meant until we had this discussion. To the point that you had no idea how much inflation benefits an economy. To the point where you stated a bullshit made up statistic as a fact. You're the one who is trying to knock something that you know absolutely nothing about. Trust me, you've proven that beyond a doubt. 
And yeah, you've also proven yourself to be ReallyRealStupid. :D

I'm forex trading with Bitcoin using a pretty awesome low-risk strategy and EA. It averages me around 10% a month profit (which I get in Bitcoin, never needing to touch fiat!). 
I live off about half the profit, and just keep rolling over the rest. No need to touch other shitcoins, or get sucked into day trading. I LOVE IT. :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:58:04


Projecting again, you're the one spouting bullshit ad infinitum, 


Transactions per day are increasing, end of fucking story. That means people AND businesses are using and TRANSACTING with Bitcoin every single day. Again, end of fucking story. Proof is in the pudding.  


Both issues, which are minor to savvy BTC users, cease to be issues for anybody with Segwit, and once LN starts getting adopted more, even more so. 
The fact that Ebay is even considering implementation is more than enough for now. Amazon is also doing it, though they're much more hush-hush about it. The fact that thousands of online stores already take BTC is more than enough evidence. 
So do you want to keep raising bullshit red herring issues and claim that the rising number of transactions don't mean anything? Because that's exactly what you're doing, to no avail. 


Projecting yet again. Because you're clearly the dense one here. Just keeping shit real. 


See what I mean? Totally full of shit. 
Segwit IS here, and is rapidly getting added to more and more wallets and exchanges. LN just got added to the mainnet. All that needs to happen now are client-side API's to get implemented and people to set up Lightning nodes, which incidentally, I'll be doing myself in the near future. 
So... tell me again about "3 years" from now... dipshit. :D


Nope, but yet again, you're playing yourself right back into a hole of utter, total stupidity. 
Hey idiot, I use fiat money for the "last mile" of the transaction when it's clearly to my advantage to do so. See, the fact that I exchange BTC for fiat in small increments in order to be able to spend with a debit card that allows me to use it in any denomination with NO currency exchange fees or any other costs, is SMART. 
I'm leveraging the value of my BTC to MY advantage. The business I'm transacting with is still benefiting albeit by receiving fiat instead of BTC, but hey, that's better than nothing. 
My BTC is only in a "fiat" state to save me currency exchange fees, which in my case can add up quite quickly, since I travel extensively as a digital nomad. 
For transactions in my home currency, I have a debit card that handles that quite nicely directly with BTC, no exchange needed. This gives me tremendous buying power with my BTC within the existing financial framework. Over time, it's clear to me that I will need to do this less and less, being that I will be more and more able to use BTC and perhaps other crypto (like LTC) directly with more and more businesses that I transact with. It really is that simple. Now, let's see you try to obfuscate and red herring the shit out of this argument. I can't wait... :D


There you go again, a buffoon trying to tell someone who's using Bitcoin as a currency every single day for the last 2+ years that Bitcoin isn't a currency. 
And then you wonder why I call you a moron, idiot, etc. Really? :D


Yes. You. Can. 
And while it's not widely implemented and adopted yet. It will be in due time. In the meantime, it's incumbent on BTC users to leverage the tools that they have available to them now to get the most out of Bitcoin. 
And yeah, some of them are still legacy tools like debit cards, who cares? At the end of the day, I'm still using BTC on those small, inconsequential spends, and my capital base is increasing in value, while not getting eaten away by inflation and currency manipulation like it would be if it were sitting in a bank account. If you still can't figure that out, it's can only be because you're an ideologically-stunted, blinded-by-bias... idiot. :)


The dumb ones do, so fucking what? The smart ones? They see the power of not only accepting payments in BTC, but using BTC for their capital reserves vs. keeping it in bullshit, inflationary fiat that ends up just working against their bottom line in the long run. 


Some do, again... so fucking what? People who solely want to speculate on BTC's value are perfectly welcome to do so. What are their other options these days? 
Gold??? :D
Stocks??? :D :D :D
Bonds????? :D :D :D :D :D


Says the idiot who can't face any real facts. The BTC network is not a company. It's an ecosystem, a community of developers, programmers and engineers that are ahead of the curve when it comes to solutions for now as well as the future. Is it perfect? Nope. Will it ever be perfect? Nope. It is however, getting more optimized over time and has proven itself time and time again to be censorship-resistant and anti-fragile as fuck. That's what matters now. 


Wrong, it's essentially live. It's waiting on dev to be completed for back-end and client-side solutions. The framework and the infrastructure is essentially ready to roll. I watched a live transaction happen, shit's real. 


You keep repeating yourself, stomping your feet, and insisting that Bitcoin is what you say it is, and nothing more. 
Hey asshole, you're clearly misinformed, as well as biased to the point that you just spout the same FUD shit over and over again. Trust me, everybody sees right through you. I'm not posting these "walls" of responses to convert you, you're beyond that. My goal here is to reply to the ridiculous FUD and misinformation I see oozing all over this sub and let people see the FACTS and the realities in opposition to the lies, bullshit and misinformation being purported by pseudo-intellectual, barely coherent dipshits like you. 


Again, you literally make no sense whatsoever. How many times is that now? :D


Projecting again. I've responded point by point to every FUD-laden claim and argument that you've made. You're the one making not only baseless assumptions, but claiming shit that's not even remotely true. I am calling you each and every lame ass point that you make, and it bugs the shit out of you. Why? Because you know I'm right, and you're wrong, and you're ending up looking like the total lying FUDster moron that we both know you are. Own it. :)


Projection again. I've done more than that. Tell me again about LN being merely "alpha". :D


Funny, it feels like I'm talking to an illiterate, pseudo-intellectual moron with a fourth-grade reading level. Considering the fact that I'm most likely older than you, (I'm in my 50's), let's consider that I'm probably closer to being right than you are. :D


Laughing at your stupidity, expressing my laughter with emoticons, have I made a SP quote? Don't remember that. :P
And yet again... it's not an insult if what I'm saying is true. You've proven yourself beyond any reasonable doubt to be a full of shit, FUDster, uneducated, ill-informed... moron. Sorry if the truth hurts, you should work on all of that, and then maybe you won't be told that. 


We'll see how seriously people take me when I show them how to trade forex profitably like I am, with little or no risk, using Bitcoin... for absolutely no cost. That's right, I'm going to be doing it for free. 
That's why I am posting here on this u/ dumbass. It's to help and educate people and share the wealth, while I debunk FUD and call out idiots like you in the meantime. What are you bringing you to the table? Nothing but FUD, bullshit, lies, misinformation and deception. 
And yeah, I shall call you out. It's my pleasure, and my honor to do so. 
What else ya got, FUDster dipshit?
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:18:05


Ok, fair enough. So stop like acting like one maybe?


Yes, the cost does go up when the mempool backs up. It has also gone up due to the fact that a satoshi is worth now than it was in the past. Nonetheless, there are many ways that these cost issues can be managed and mitigated. Using the right wallet, and knowing HOW to use it will do wonders for your transaction costs. If you have to "rush" a transaction, then maybe paying a couple of bucks for a transaction accelerator (while paying a lower fee) may be worth the shekels. I'd rather pay a service $5 while paying .50 in net fees, than paying a $20 network fee because I have no idea what I'm doing. Call me crazy. 


I'm nice when it's warranted. I'm direct when it's warranted too. Too often there's a lot of time wasted on FUD and bs instead of spent on constructive/instructive conversations. Like I said, I've been on Reddit now over the last several years, and yeah, I've become pretty conscious about the time I spend out here. Wasting time catering to people's fragile egos and coddling them because they post needlessly about stuff they know nothing about vs. taking the time to educate themselves with the vast resources available to them is no longer tolerated. 


I'm all for helping people, but I need to see them helping themselves first. Interestingly enough, the very reason I have set up this new Reddit account is because I plan on using it to teach people how to trade Forex with Bitcoin profitably and with little or no risk whatsoever, as I have been doing (and living off of) for the past 2+ years now... absolutely free of charge. 
Crazy huh? :)
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:25:45


Was that a question? :)
I'm all for helping people who help themselves first. If I see people taking the initiative to learn about the game they're in,I'll help them all day long. If I see people come on this sub and just whine incessantly about bullshit because they choose to remain ignorant... well, no time for that shit. Especially since all you're doing is the same shit that an endless stream of FUDsters do out here all day long. So act like a FUDster, you shall be treated like one. 


Yeah, BTC's success depends on how well idiots on this sub are coddled and gladhanded. Grow the fuck up. Thanks for the laugh, idiot. :D
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:17:38

Actually, you just further proved that you're completely inept about economics in every possible way. :)
 
Seriously, this is fucking hilarious. 


How do you "lose money" on an increase that happens in the future after you've used currency? Pretty theoretical no? 
Isn't what you said basically the same thing as if you went on a trip from the US to Europe, exchanged USD to Euros while you're traveling there, only to have the USD shoot up in value against the EUR when you get back from your trip? So what, did you "lose" money during your Euro-vacation? That's how ridiculous you sound. :D


Again, you're ignoring the FACT that Bitcoin increased well over 1000-1500% over the year or so BEFORE that dip. Making the dip totally irrelevant to anyone who's held BTC longer than a month before it happened. Not to mention that anyone who bought before the dip and didn't do anything with it during the actual dip benefited just fine afterwards too. So yeah, just admit that you have absolutely no clue about what you're talking about. 


Yeah, go look at the monthly charts for the USD, EUR, GBP over the last 10 years, and then look at BTCUSD, and tell me which one is more stable. 
I dare you. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:39:33
Ah... meh. 
Then again, pretty much anything other than your shilling and babblling out here can be considered "top notch" at some level. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:10:05

@_date: 2017-12-13 14:55:58


So... fucking what? You asked for 3 (then 5) businesses that accept Bitcoin directly. Far more than that are on those lists. On my previous response, I gave you just one app that allows businesses/online stores to accept BTC and other cryptos on the fly directly to any wallet that has 4,000 active downloads, as well as two platforms that service another several thousand businesses via their API and platforms. Case closed dumbass. 


Again, so fucking what? Does that change the fact that the vast majority of the businesses listed on those three sites alone do accept Bitcoin, and are literally just three of probably thousands of directories and other sites that list businesses that take BTC? Why is it so hard for you to just admit that I answered your question without obfuscating and raising red herrings? 
 
Again... I have absolutely no problem finding businesses and individuals who will accept BTC no matter where I am more than 95% of the time. 


Steam just stopped taking Bitcoin recently, like a week ago. And all you can do at this point is cherry pick the ones on the lists that you claim don't take Bitcoin directly for whatever reason rather than just concede that I gave you far more than the number of businesses you asked for. 
Case closed, dumbass. 


Yep, and again, the VAST majority of the businesses, companies and sites on those lists DO take Bitcoin, which means that you lose. 
Eat it. Own it.

Yeah, and now their chain is how much longer than BTC's? And it's mostly of empty blocks just to pay miners to mine it instead of BTC. Since nobody even gives a crap about that shitcoin. The BTRASH cadre had a plan, they were positive that doing that crazy EDA for as long as they did would be a death knell for BTC. 
It wasn't, obviously, and now all they can do is pump their shitcoin and keep up a ridiculous FUD campaign against BTC. 
And yeah, we can see how well that's working, even in Venezuela. :D
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:47:29
Of course the BTRASH fudsters are going to lie about this. They lie about everything else, don't they?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:37:15


Nope, you're blinded by your sheer stupidity. 
25%?? 
Surely you pulled that number right out of your ass. :D
Hey idiot, take a look at this chart: 
Over its entire history, BTC's transaction volume has gone from zero transactions per day to well over 400,000 per day as of today, in less than 8 years. 
BTW, people are using it in other smarter ways than just spending it at the local Starbucks. 
Care to make yourself look even stupider than you already have? 
@_date: 2018-09-24 11:09:08
But that didn't happen, did it? Coulda woulda shoulda... 
So there's no point in delving into hypothetical scenarios and what-ifs. This particular issue has been resolved nodes are getting updated, miners have been alerted, everything that's supposed to happen when something like this occurs. happened in short order. 
And you can rest assured that this will set off a flurry of code patrols by the devs and community at large to look for any other possible issues or vulnerabilities. If anything, this was yet another trial by fire for Bitcoin and the community learned from it, and handled it about as well as it can be handled. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:24:19

@_date: 2017-12-18 03:45:40

@_date: 2018-09-24 10:04:58
There will always be vulnerabilities and issues as Bitcoin continues to evolve and become more optimized. 
It was a DoS vulnerability which was subsequently related to a bug that could potentially have caused inflation. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:00:07
Wrong. Economists across the board agree that an inflation rate 2% a year or less is "healthy". Anything above that, is not. The US' average inflation rate for the last 75 years or so has been 3.5%. 
Bitcoin is the antithesis of fiat. I suggest you read up on what "backs up" bitcoin, since you clearly have no clue now. Get to know and understand the concept of "proof of work" for one thing. 
Let's not forget to mention that it's a fully decentralized, censorship-resistant currency (and asset class) that no central bank, corporation, government or any other entity can control or manipulate.
 
So yeah, stay away from Bitcoin, do yourself and the rest of us a favor. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:40:15

You're becoming so defensive and anxious that you're mistyping and oozing anxiety all over your keyboard. It isn't helping you communicate your ideas. Then again, you've been having trouble with that since comment  


So now you're going to go with a theoretical that nobody is going to use it? How fucking stupid is that? Do you not realize that by showing businesses and retail storefronts how by implementing LN to their business will allow them to save the standard 2-5% that they pay in merchant fees to accept credit and debit cards, how much of a fucking game-changer that will be? And that all a customer will need to do is load an app or use a LN-ready wallet and scan a fucking QR code to make it all happen? You do realize that both businesses and customers will go apeshit over this when they come to understand that it will free them from banks, debit cards and a current legacy system that is utter  shit, right? If not, then yeah, you're biased and clueless. 


Yeah, you pretty much did. But anyway... you're just talking in circles and out of your ass by now. Maybe you should just hang it up?

@_date: 2017-12-16 05:17:09
Valuing it compared to fiat is only used as an indication of value, because it's a recognized way to measure value. It doesn't mean that BTC is "dependent" on fiat. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:23:25


Yeah, obfuscate, red herring and dissect shit to the point of ridiculousness, when you can't dispute the actual numbers. Yep, you're a dipshit. :)


It's not stagnating, dumbass. The numbers defy your bullshit claims, dumbass. 


Sure it is. Just use a debit card for smaller purchases like I do every day until Segwit and LN get further adopted. Eventually, it will be as easy as a cashier scanning your phone's QR code and boom, they have the funds in their receiving wallet in minutes, for pennies a transaction. In the meantime, debit cards and payment apps fill the gap quite nicely, I can assure you. :)




And... so fucking what? Nobody cares about why a couple of businesses stopped taking bitcoin. Overstock.com seems to still have no problem accepting BTC. And now there's talk that Ebay will add it on too. Sounds like quite a dilemma here. :)
For every business that claims that BTC isn't viable for payments, (for whatever bullshit reasons are actually behind those decisions that have nothing to do with BTC or fees), there are ten businesses who have no problem taking it, and are coming aboard each and every day. This is especially true for service businesses that deal with mid-high ticket invoices. For them, BTC is simply a no-brainer. That trend will only continue. 
Rest assured that there are plenty of businesses coming onboard every day with a specific strategy of accepting BTC and keeping BTC to strengthen their capital reserves. 
Something quite attractive about retaining a deflationary currency that increases in value over a relatively short period of time that attracts the attention of savvy business owners. Imagine that. 


Wow, that's a pretty stupid question. Then again, look at who I'm dealing with here. :D


Yes, Coinbase is an exchange, and the fact that they got 6 million new customers in less than one year means that there will be 6 million more people in just that one exchange alone, buying and using Bitcoin that weren't doing so last year. That spells adoption. 
Now count in the exponential growth of all the other major exchanges around the world, and yeah... the numbers and facts speak for themselves. Maybe that's why Bitcoin just hit 19k? Maybe? :)
I buy my groceries every day with BTC, no matter where I am in the world. How, with a debit card. One that I either load with BTC (much like Coinbase's own Shift card, Xapo, or Cryptopay for just a couple of examples) or via my prepaid debit card that I load with fiat that I got from exchanging BTC. Problem solved. Do you notice how you create a problem where there isn't one? Exaggerate fees that most people don't pay? Make bogus claims that aren't true? That's because you're an obtuse, ideologically-blinded FUDster moron. 
 


Oh I've been making sound arguments all along, and just made some more right now. 
And really, it was no sweat whatsoever to do so. If anything, you just make it too easy. I feel like I'm debating a fucking 12 year old.  
You, on the other hand are spinning yourself around in circles to the point of sheer stupidity. You can't debate yourself out of a hole. 
As I always say, it's not an insult if it's true. You've clearly shown yourself thus far to be intellectually-stunted, ideologically-blinded and woefully inept to even participate in this discussion. 
You have done nothing but make one bogus bullshit argument after another, resorted to obfuscation and red herring arguments to the point of ridiculousness, and then try to claim that you're making factual claims. Let's keep shit real, mmkay? :)

It's not too costly if people know what they're doing, which they do. And yeah, BTC is saving a lot of people's financial asses in the developing world as we speak, and that trend will only continue with more adoption.

Bitcoin's surviving this just fine.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:52:59
They're using BTC to combat hyperinflation that's killing their fiat currency, which it does quite beautifully. Same is being done in Argentina, as well as other inflation hot zones such as Brazil and Zimbabwe. They also learn fast how to manage and minimize fees, especially since there's such an active local community that shows them how to do it. Don't worry, they know how to use BTC better than you do.

All part of the continuous FUD/sabotage campaign by the BTRASH idiots. And yes, they will eventually get tired of (and sick of paying for) spamming the network, until they decide it's time to do it again next time. People need to be smart with their transactions, understand that waiting a bit longer for confirmations isn't the end of the world, and yeah, adopt Segwit (already live) and LN, which is just about here, asap.

Nobody cares what you buy or not, dimbulb. Every person has to make their own decision as to what's best for them financially. You made a ridiculously ludicrous blanket statement regarding what people's intentions are for getting into Bitcoin, while you're not even remotely qualified to form an opinion for yourself, obviously. 
So just move on to whatever you think is  "better". Nobody cares. Just quit whining on Reddit about it already. Geez.  
@_date: 2018-09-04 15:08:42
Yet again, you have no idea what you're talking about. 
Coinbase alone acquired 11.7 million accountholders as of 2017. 
Number of active wallets on just Blockchain now exceeds 28 million. 
Visa commissioned a study in 2016 that showed 35 million wallets in use, with as much as 30% of them being deemed "active". 
This doesn't include users who primarily used their exchanges for storing Bitcoins, which is a pretty huge number. 
Anything else you want to say that will just make you look more hilarious (and stupid)?

I've been around a lot longer than that. I saw the dotcom boom and bust from the inside out too. Nobody knows hype cycles better than I do, not trying to one-up you, but just the way it is. 


You still don't get it. This is a paradigm shift on so many levels nobody can believe it. Bitcoin doesn't need hype. This has been building up for years. What's happening now is the critical not as phase. It's not a "growth frenzy", this is organic and is built on everything that happened before. 


Let's face it, you're trying to correlate what is happening with bitcoin with stuff that happened in recent history that in no way compares. This isn't happening because of a "herd mentality" any more than what happened with the internet in its early days happened because of "herd mentality". 


Well, again, that's just because you really have no idea what game you're in. As much as you claim to be a fan of BTC and think you understand it, you still don't get the fundamental implications of what is actually happening. You act as if it's some kind of fashion trend or passing fad. Not. 


Oh shut up, I wasn't a "churner" and I never abused anything. 
Just got tired of the game and decided that I wasn't going to play anymore. I saw that my issuing banks were just trying to nickel and dime me to death to make up for interest that they weren't making from me, and decided they needed to recoup some costs for those mileage and bennies I was earning by using their cards. They weren't willing to live up to their end of the deal, and that was it for me. It didn't matter that by then I was seeing through the whole scam that was perpetuated by big banks, and the Fed. Which is a big reason why I love BTC so much. I don't have to fuck with any of that anymore, and life is awesome. :D
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:02:26
At this current level, they're going through fine at 70 sat/b for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:54:00
Exactly. Funny how people here don't get it and all they can do is whine and continue to spread "high fees" FUD. 
@_date: 2018-09-04 16:07:22


Those examples I gave were strictly to debunk your "17 milion" bullshit. 
Rest assured that the numbers are much higher, especially considering users that are only on exchanges. 


We don't know, do we? :) 
But let's just accept the logical assumption that the vast majority of wallets are held by individuals. I suspect very few multiple-wallet holders hold hundreds or thousands of wallets just for themselves. Exchanges surely have millions of wallets within their own ecosystems, most certainly. 


Slow huh? 
Hmmm... that's funny, I just sent $2000 worth of Bitcoin to a contractor in Malaysia yesterday. Confirmed in less than 5 minutes and cost me a whole .20 to send. 
Wow... that was horrible.... :D 


Scaling just fine from what I can see. Especially with LN coming along. 


Private enough for me, and other innovations like Schnorr signatures (and even LN) will resolve "privacy" issues that most people may have. 


Only to ignorant morons like yourself. The rest of us who get it? Nah, it's anything but boring. Oh, did I mention that I live off the profits I'm earning from my forex trading using Bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-12-16 09:56:41


Calling out bullshit and stupidity with no apologies doesn't = hate, dipshit. 


When you exaggerate problems, and make it sound like Bitcoin is essentially dead in the water when it's nowhere near that is indeed FUD. You're the one making brainless assumptions, you just hate being called out on them. Too fucking bad. 


I use Bitcoin every single day, and never have a problem managing fees. Ever. No matter how big the mempool is. I can easily research the most optimal fee based on several factors, and with the right wallet, can pay whatever fee I decide on. I do at least one transaction a day, and often times 2-3, the most I've ever paid has been $5, and that was to move about .2 BTC (currently worth about $3600), it showed up in the receiving wallet within 2 minutes, and completely confirmed in less than 2 hours. This was when the mempool was around 120k. As long as you're not a sucker or an idiot, you can do the same thing. 


Says who, you? And never mind the fact that there currently is no better investment on the planet than Bitcoin. Bar none. There are people, like me, who are using BTC as an investment, store of value, AND their principal currency. It's really not that hard to figure out. 


People who know what they're involved in and know what's going on with BTC,  will know what "bad news or technical aspects" are valid, and those which are not. So far, you have yet to say anything even remotely valid. You are making broad assumptions as to why people are even in Bitcoin to begin with, as well as claiming that you think you know how people are using Bitcoin or not using it. Which quite frankly is utter and complete bullshit. 


I'd rather see the cheerleaders, than the shit-talking FUDsters out here, the cheerleaders are harmless, and hey, they have a lot to celebrate. Again, no other investment has come close to touching Bitcoin when it comes to annualized returns. If the truth hurts you, then it's only because you're on the wrong side of the tracks. 


It's actually a waste of my time to call out FUD and stupidity, and yet I do it. Why? Because someone has to call this shit out, and the more of us who do, the better. 
What else ya got FUDster dipshit? :)

Yeah, please lecture me... can't wait. :D


I'm calm, no worries. So go fuck yourself. No really, go right fuck yourself. :)


And that's... bullshit. Just because it may not be cost-effective to buy a damn cup of coffee with BTC doesn't render it useless in the grand scheme of things. Nevermind that I can buy coffee with BTC all day long either one of two debit cards I use that I load exclusively with BTC or BTC proceeds. So yeah, what's your fucking point? Oh right... you, along with all the other whiners on this sub, haven't made one.  
Understand one thing. I've been using, living off of and traveling on BTC for the last 2+ years on two fucking continents (soon to be three). And if anything, it just gets easier to do, not harder. 
So for people like you and other whiners on this sub to tell me that I'm somehow just a freak occurrence is quite frankly... horseshit. If I can feasibly do it, anybody can. So yeah, shut the fuck up. 


Dude, I really couldn't give a single rat's ass about what people think of me or how I'm perceived. Really, I couldn't give a flying fuck. I'm not on this sub to kiss ass and win friends. I am on this sub, believe it or not to bring some real-world experience that I have gained over the last few years regarding Bitcoin, cut through some serious FUD shit going on here, and... yep... to show people how to do what I'm doing (forex trading with BTC, to the point that I'm living quite nicely off it, thank you), for absolutely free. Crazy huh? :)


Anybody who pays anywhere close to $10 per transaction is again... an idiot, a or newbie sucker. End of story. I have yet to pay anywhere close to that (my max fee so far is about $5), and I have no trouble getting transactions confirmed within 1-2 hours more than 90-95% percent of the time. Again, if I'm doing this, anybody else can. 


Oh, but you're a BTC proponent, and you consider BTRASH a threat? Don't make me laugh. BTRASH is a shitcoin that nobody cares about and nobody wants. Every place I've ever been since August 1st, I never have a problem finding businesses and services that take BTC, and NOT ONE that takes BTRASH. Wow, imagine that. 


Thanks for the lecture dad.

Denial? Nah. First of all, that chart shows AVERAGE transaction fees. It's by no means an indication of the fees that everybody pays. The reason that the average fees shot up over the last few days on the chart is because BTC's price rose about 30% in about a week. Duh. 
Second of all, you're using a shoddy reference to state your case. It's far better to use these two to get an idea of fees and how soon transactions get confirmed within reasonable times based on the mempool's state at the time of transaction:
 
Use those two tools together, you get a crystal clear indication of the lowest fee to use to get a transaction confirmed within a reasonable time (for me 2-4 hours) is a reasonable time. You'll notice that the pending transaction count on the earn.com chart goes WAY down when you get to 61-70 sat/b level compared to the level that precedes it. Hmmm... I wonder why. 




Nope. I don't publicize any of my addresses. But all you need to do is refer to the links I just gave you, and you'll readily see that transactions in that range are confirming with no problems. Anybody who pays more than what the chart shows you is paying too much. It's that simple.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:47:41


BTC is cheap enough for them, and they know it and trust it, and for good reason. Especially for the ones who have been dealing with for the last couple of years and have benefitted big time from BTC's price rise. The last thing they need is have some shitcoin thrown on them that promises to save them a few cents per transaction and that will be the "next big thing". 


Spoken like the true pseudo-economist dolt that you are. These people are dealing with double to triple digit inflation and you want to say that a deflationary currency like Bitcoin will only make the situation worse? How stupid is that? 
Stop already. 
BTW, Venezuelans are having absolutely no problem with BTC during transactions, they're using BTC to trade into black market dollars for the most part, that allows them to buy staples and necessities at cheaper prices rather than buying them at hyperinflated Bolivar prices. Bitcoin suits them fine, especially with the value appreciation that they've incurred with it over recent months. They're not going to the mall and/or buying coffee at Starbucks with it, get a fucking clue.

It's a bit more complicated than that. Once you spend a few years in Central and South America, like I did, you learn a lot about what's going on.  Why do you think that there have been so many revolutions, insurrections and civil wars in Latin America the last several decades? It's the whole oligarchy/banana republic syndrome. Greed, corruption, and abuse by those that have power. 
And what, do you think that the US is any better? The US has turned into the biggest fucking Banana Republic in the Americas. In a few years, Venezuela's going to look like a theme park compared to them.

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:23:42
I almost never spend more than 30 cents a transaction, even when the mempool is a bit backed up. I just sent about $100 worth of BTC for less than that, and it got fully confirmed within an hour. Be smart about how you send BTC, regardless of amount, and you should never have to pay more than that. With Segwit now live, and LN right around the corner, it will only get even faster and cheaper. Don't believe the FUD, it's still quite cheap and fast to send and receive BTC in virtually any amount.

So do I, are you kidding me? I too had Citi, Amex and BofA cards that gave me gobs of free miles, rewards and redeemable points. Paid the balance off each month, or carried balances for never more than 2 or 3 months. Sure, my free stuff was getting subsidized by those who were carrying balances at the beginning too. 
Then I started to notice that they would upgrade my card automatically to "gold" or "platinum", just so they can assess an annual fee ($69-99). Then they'd increase my limit or give me a line of credit that I can use anytime I wanted to by just writing a check. 
Then... they started adding in all kinds of bullshit admin fees, atm usage, pos fees and miscellaneous charges to my statement, that when I added them all up, would amount to another $200 or so a year. 
Sure the miles were great, and I used the shit out of them. But eventually, it just became a battle of wits between me and the banks, so I told them to fuck off. 


Banks already see the writing on the wall. Why do you think Dimon is so apeshit against BTC??? 
Many services and businesses that I deal with directly with BTC give me a discount for paying with BTC. I do marketing consulting from time to time, and if a client pays me via BTC, I give them a discount of 3% which I would get charged by Paypal anyway. This always ends up working out in my favor, since the BTC value goes up during the time I'm doing the project. One time, my BTC contract milestone payments doubled. :D
This is the thing I try to get business owners to see when I talk to them about Bitcoin. It gives them an opportunity to build a solid capital reserve that will easily give them a hedge against inflation while increasing in value steadily. Even if they only get 5% of their sales in BTC, that amount can grow nicely over time, provided they don't cash it out. 
In my experience, well over 80% of the business owners I talk to that take BTC do not change out to fiat.


Things are happening lightning fast for BTC these days, and implementation by businesses/retailers will easily become the next level of that critical mass. 
You can't look anywhere without BTC being discussed, price is going through the roof and people can't ignore it anymore. Stop being such a damn cynic and understand the game you're in. Because seriously, right now, it's clear that you don't have a clue. You just tried to extol the virtues of credit cards with me just now. :D

,&gt;A lot of transactions now are people buying based on speculation. 
Wow, you really are an idiot, aren't you? Had to outdo yourself yet again, eh? 
:D :D :D 
Hey moron, when people buy or sell BTC on an exchange, that doesn't show up as a transaction on the blockchain. Those trades are done internally on the exchanges' closed systems. The transaction shows up on the blockchain only for deposits (of BTC) and withdrawals. As far as withdrawals are concerned, the exchanges batch up several withdrawals into bulk transactions, thus saving block space and reducing confirmation times. 


Dude, just face it, you have no idea of what you're talking about. You don't even know what constitutes a bubble in any way, shape or form. You have not a single grasp of basic economics to begin with. Bitcoin's value and market cap hasn't even scratched the surface yet. Compare Bitcoin's almost $300B market cap to gold (which incidentally, BTC is steadily eating away at), which is $8.5 TRILLION. Do the math, moron.  


You're the only one spouting nonsense, dipshit. Starting from the moment you tried to call BTC a fiat currency (which let's face it, you did that because until that moment you didn't have a fucking clue what "fiat" even meant), all the way through your idiotic rantings, you trying to claim that BTC's transaction volume has only gone up 25%, which was handily and factually debunked, right up to now, you trying to claim Bitcoin is a bubble when you don't even know what a fucking bubble is. 
Just admit that you're a clueless dolt, you have no idea of what you're talking about, and you're in way over your head on this sub. Just stop worrying about BTC, stay away from it, and you'll be just fine. So will we.

In most cases, it makes more financial sense to keep paying a house's mortgage while keeping the bulk of a BTC holding actively working for you. a few percent a year in interest is NOTHING compared to how much BTC will earn in valuation and hedging from inflation over a long period of time.

Bubble up, bubble down... :D 
 


Yeah, been hearing that shit since 2010. :D










Funny how most governments are coming to terms with the fact that there's no real way to "regulate" software. And the fact that there are entire industries, including the finance sector starting to take BTC seriously... um yeah... it's not going anywhere. 


I don't have to "bleet" about it all. The stats speak for itself hundreds of new nodes being added each week, and the total value of BTC circulating on the network is now over 100BTC, considering that it just went into mainnet a few months ago, that kind of growth is blowing everybody's minds, except of course, idiots like you. :)


I don't trade shitcoins, ritardo. I trade forex using Bitcoin as my base currency. Totally different ballgame and stating the fact that I'm living off my profits isn't bragging. :)

That's a dynamic that's rapidly changing. Never mind that bitpay's model is flawed and unnecessary to begin with. Any business can do what they do with Bitpay with a simple plugin/app, their own wallet and an exchange. If a business wants to withdraw funds on a daily basis for whatever BTC they took in that day, they could complete the transaction in a matter of minutes and boom, it's in their account the next day. Since Bitpay controls all the fees, that puts merchants/businesses at a disadvantage. They soon figure out that they don't need Bitpay, and can do better on their own. At least the smart ones do. 


Well, you clearly don't like thinking then. More and more brick and mortar businesses are taking Bitcoin. I'm currently in SE Asia, and I've seen the number of businesses taking BTC skyrocket over the past couple of years out here. Same in Europe. Most are service businesses dealing with mid to high-ticket items. I just spent two months in Bangkok, and I've encountered dozens of businesses and services that take BTC. 
I'm in Kuala Lumpur right now, and the co-working space I've been using takes BTC, and even gives me a sweet weekly rate for it. I'm paying for the apt that I'm staying at with BTC. So hmmm.... I must be doing something wrong, if I'm coming across all these businesses that take BTC and you're not. 


I'll bet you that I talk to more merchants who handle Bitcoin than you do, and sorry, my anecdotal evidence defies yours. But hey, keep talking FUD shit, acting like you know what's going on, when you don't.

@_date: 2017-12-13 03:35:46
The fees are that high because of Bitpay. If you pay directly from your wallet to the merchant's receiving wallet, you have more control over fees. Hello???
No merchant? Sorry to break this to you, plenty of merchants are still taking BTC. As for the nightmare of volatility, in the long run that works to the merchant's advantage. 
Most merchants that I talk to who accept BTC (I'm a full-time traveler, and run into BTC-accepting merchants all over the world) don't cash out to fiat because they can see that the longer they hold it as BTC, the more it will go up in value. Which is more than they can say for the fiat they take as payments. 
So yeah, stop with the bullshit FUD. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:55:18


You're all for BTC, but you ask concern troll/FUD questions? 
Ok then.  


It's growing just fine, it's doing just fine, so don't get your panties in a bunch. Any challenges are hugely exaggerated and most if not all of them are being perpetuated artificially to bring BTC down. Mempool spamming? Not BTC's fault. Endless FUD about high fees due to mempool spamming? Not BTC's fault. 
Core, BTC-related companies and devs not "working fast enough" to satisfy every whiny spoiled brat who insists on instant confirmations and tiny fees? Yeah, grow the fuck up and get fucking real. 


Actually, you'll need to blame my toxic fingers this particular instance. And nah, I'm over coddling people and catering to fragile egos because they're "worried" or "concerned" about Bitcoin for the lamest reasons on earth. 
Stop already. 


Don't want to be treated like a FUDster by me or others? Try not to sound like one. Sorry, but every other post out here is someone whining or "being concerned" about stuff that they have no clue about. It's time consuming as fuck to scroll through all the shit posts to get to the ones that matter and deserve attention. There are plenty of other topics worthy of discussion without resorting to whining, concern trolling and FUD, up your game.

Ah, this is nothing. Lots of mempool spamming going on as part of a massive FUD/destabilization campaign being perpetuated by the assholes at BTRASH.

It has everything to do with the wallet you use. Use a crappy wallet, or an exchange wallet, and you don't have the kind of control over fees that you should have. Are you kidding me? :D




Ok, thanks for showcasing your now clear ineptitude. That fee guide you posted is an absolute JOKE! :D :D :D 
There is a rather comprehensive sliding scale regarding fees based on what you're willing to pay. This page you gave me gives three ridiculously basic options. It's a FUD source in itself. It's utterly HILARIOUS. 
Here's a better one for you to use:
This one gives you a complete rundown of min-max confirmation times in relation to the various tiers of fees you can pay, starting from zero sat/b. 
You can see how many transactions are waiting in any fee level of the mempool by going here:
Keep in mind that I do at least one transaction a day, usually around 2-3. I typically pay between 20 - 90 sat/b, depending on priority, amount of transaction and the mempool.  My latest transaction cost 90 sat/b @ 220 bytes = .198 mbtc = $3.25
This was for a transaction of .18 btc, and it got its first confirmation in less than  40 minutes. Fully confirmed within 2 hours. 
Amazing. 
I had a transaction two days ago that was lower priority, so I sent it for 50 sat/b and it confirmed within 5 hours. 
I know, insane!!! :O
Thanks for proving beyond a doubt that you have no clue about fees, how to optimize transactions or even what kind of wallet you should use. You probably shouldn't be commenting on things that you have no idea what you're talking about, perpetuating FUD while you're at it.

Wow, ya did it again. :D
Yet again, you clearly have no idea of what you're talking about. The node that you open a channel with can't do anything with your BTC that you load on to it, all it can do is use it to relay a transaction up to that sat value sent by you over the rest of the network. 
If they or you close the channel, everybody gets whatever BTC they put into the channel back minus a few sats for network fees (fractions of a cent). 
Why? It's a smart contract, hello? :O
Wow. Are you truly that ignorant that you weren't able to understand even that ridiculously basic concept? :)
And... you do realize that you can be your own node too, right?


Oh, please don't flatter yourself dimwit. :) 
I'm laughing my ass off at your public display of ignorance. Funny how that seems to be the only thing that entertains me on Reddit these days. :)

I'm not the newbie here, clearly. :) 
You can contact your exchange's support and ask them to up the fee, moron.

It wasn't a one word response, it was a three word response. And quite frankly, that's all it needed. :)
And yes, everybody and their brother is doing their damndest to jump on the "blockchain" bandwagon. So what?? People will continue getting misinformed until they figure out for themselves what blockchain (and Bitcoin) are really all about, won't they? 
As you may have noticed, there's quite a shakeout going on in the crypto biz. Many of those shitcoins tried to capitalize on the "blockchain" as well, even to the point where they made claims that they were "better" at blockchain than Bitcoin. Guess what? Not one of them have succeeded in replacing or supplanting Bitcoin when it comes to defining blockchain. That's how it's going to be for a very long time, IMO. 
As Andreas says right in the video, it's a cliche'. It doesn't mean anything, despite what startups and various companies attempt to do with it. Especially when they contradict themselves by "centralizing" their "blockchain technology" at some level. Otherwise, there won't be a profit motive. 
There's going to be marketing, savvy slick ads and all kinds of "woo-woo" shit regarding blockchain as well as a whole new assload of "blockchain-based applications" coming down the pike. Sure, one or two out of 40 or 50, may succeed in whatever they're trying to disrupt or replace, most won't. And YEARS down the road, the essential foundation of blockchain will still be Bitcoin, for about a million new reasons we don't even know about yet. :)
There, happy now?

He's being a dishonest, lazy-ass slouch. He is asking questions that no person who's done even an iota of research of Bitcoin and blockchain technology would even dare to ask. He's being asinine and acting like he's posing intriguing questions when he doesn't even remotely have a clue of what he's talking about. Ain't nobody got time for that shit, so he gets ridiculed. 
Especially since he claims that he watched every Bitcoin documentary on Youtube out there. Obtusely lie much? :D
There are AMPLE resources available on the sidebar of this sub where people can get the information they're looking for without asking stupid-ass questions acting as if they are intellectually challenging the community. Give me a fucking break.

@_date: 2018-08-11 11:51:03
The problem with most Bitcoin/crypto traders is that they're doing it wrong. They're trying to profit from shitcoins by risking their Bitcoin value, or vice versa. The best (and IMO only way) to profit from Bitcoin is using it to trade against forex pairs with the same strategy that banks and Wall Street profit from forex, with little or no risk. This is what I have been doing for almost 3 years now and won't even think of trading any other way for my bread and butter. And what's particularly awesome about trading this way is that it doesn't even matter what is going on with Bitcoin's price from day to day. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:40:33
Ah, sorry, didn't realize that you were trying to be ridiculously clandestine about spending your BTC. :)
And... you do realize that the person actually getting the debit card doesn't have to be you, right? :)

Bullshit. I've been using AND hodling BTC for the last 2+ years, and it's worked perfectly fine as currency, base currency for trading forex and store of value. Fees are low because BTC is working more efficiently than ever, and the BTRASH'ers tx spam campaign ran out of gas (literally). Segwit and transaction batching accounts for the lower transaction volume and smaller transaction sizes.
Get a fucking clue.

You would save yourself a ton of trouble if you just had a decent prepaid debit card with IBAN linked up to an exchange or even BISQ. You would want a card that charges little or no currency exchange fees and has reasonable international ATM rates. Then simply exchange the BTC you want to exchange, cash out to your debit card using SEPA. Funds usually post within a matter of hours. 
Next, go to ATM withdraw local currency. Boom. done. You wouldn't have had to go through everything you did. 
Plus, there are now cards that let you load BTC directly into your account and exchange to EUR/GBP or USD on demand, like Wirex. We have one of those too, they work great for the most part.

Oh, I understand, which is why I had no choice but to call you out on your utter stupidity. I mean seriously, this post was beyond shitpost-stupid. Raise the bar, dude. 
 


Comments like yours do nothing but raise confusion unnecessarily, while feeding into ignorance, much like what you're displaying on your post without a hint of self-awareness. People who take the time to educate themselves BEFORE actually thinking that it's a good idea to post something as incredibly stupid as what you posted are the ones who deserve due attention and discussion. The shit you posted? Deserves nothing less than the ridicule you're getting. 


Healthy discussion about an utterly ridiculously stupid post? Sorry, better things to do with my time. I'll just call you out your hilarious stupidity and move on. :)


Actually, that's what your stupid post is doing, so don't project you clueless dolt. 
And yeah, I'm quite tired of seeing ignorance and stupidity on Reddit, no time to beat around the bush anymore. I'll call it for what it is and move on. 


I'll gladly condescend on stupidity that you clearly displayed with your shitpost. That's not arrogance, it's honesty. Maybe instead of posting something so hilariously stupid, you took the time to actually do some research to figure out WHY what you thought was so inherently stupid, maybe you'd get somewhere. 
If you can't figure that out, then don't complain when people like me state the obvious. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:02:41
Yeah, I'll keep laughing, especially since my returns have been high triple digits for going on the last two years now. :D :D :D 
But back to Paypal for a minute...
As you can see on the chart, their price rise started leveling off in November '17, slightly peaked in January, and has been treading water ever since, with a slight downward trend  
So yeah, I'll keep laughing, because I'm willing to bet that's as high as Paypal's stock price will ever get. :D

@_date: 2018-05-25 08:01:45
Another idiotic comment. :)
Fees are most definitely lower because of segwit. Batching has most definitely made BTC's network performance more efficient. What distorted the numbers and scale was the months-long assault on BTC's network by tx spammers who were looking to advance their BTRASH at the expense of BTC. When that failed, they gave up. In the meantime, BTC implemented segwit (currently to the tune of about 40% of transactions), exchanges (who are responsible for a large share of all transactions) started batching transactions, and things went down. What also happened in the meantime was BTC users stopped using shitty wallets that were exploiting fees (thus causing the average fees to be extraordinarily high), so that helped as well. As far as usage as a currency goes, BTC still has a LONG way to go for wider acceptance. LN is most definitely going to help that accelerate now that businesses have a means to accept small payments quickly and efficiently, while saving 3-5% on merchant processing fees (and Paypal fees). Ultimately, it will become a no-brainer. Businesses aren't going to just leave money on the table, and more and more will adopt. So keep whining about bullshit semantics if you must, nobody cares. I for one sure don't. Paypal is dead to me and it will become dead to many others as well. Don't worry, time will prove me right.

Yeah, it does. So what? Using and leveraging fiat to be able to USE Bitcoin is smart. The key is to keep exchange fees and usage fees low. People need to get over this thing about exchanging currencies to complete the last mile of a transaction. Grow up people.

Really? You need to ask? :D
Amazing how many startups, ICOs and launches can make such amazing claims, backed by absolutely nothing. Please. Stop.

Shitcoin speculators sure are suffering. The rest of us, not so much...
@_date: 2018-08-30 12:48:32
Again... lay off the shrooms, idiot. 
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:39:45
Yep, you're totally misunerstanding the concept. Glad you figured that out. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:16:36
Wow, that was idiotic.

No, he's a TRASHhole. Because that shit ain't even cash. :D
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:44:06
He admittedly knows nothing about Bitcoin, yet he thinks he can render an opinion on it. Where I come from, that's sheer ignorance.  It's obvious that this old geezer doesn't want to believe that the game he's mastered for so long is coming to an abrupt end. 
@_date: 2018-08-26 18:29:52
Yeah, I was being snarky. :)

@_date: 2018-05-24 09:18:46
Ebay spun them off, then essentially threw them under the bus by announcing that Paypal wouldn't be their primary payment system anymore. 
@_date: 2018-05-19 09:19:32
Yep, an idiotic opinion by a Dunning-Krugerized dolt who has not even a basic understanding of economics, yet decides to display his total ignorance and stupidity in grand fashion to the world. *golf clap*
@_date: 2018-08-16 10:31:06
Nah, that's an idiotic stereotype that has nothing to do with mass adoption. More and more people are coming to understand that the current financial and payment systems are shit. If they see a worthwhile alternative, they'll flock to it, even if there's a learning curve. Bitcoin was NEVER meant to just pay for coffee at Starbucks. It's a way bigger concept than that, a LOT bigger. And that's the jump people need to make in order to "get it" .
@_date: 2018-08-30 09:41:07
The "big minds"... :D :D :D
@_date: 2018-08-17 16:14:40
You should inform yourself a bit more before forming an opinion. Otherwise yeah, you're just perpetuating FUD knowingly or not.

Delusional idiots.

Do you think Bitcoin would be better if morons like you didn't ask stupid FUD-ass questions on Reddit? 
Answer since you're clearly too much of an idiot to understand: Yes. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 18:46:23

@_date: 2018-08-31 13:40:29
Nah, just a low threshold for ridiculously insipid Dunning-Kruger displays out here. I'm not on Reddit to make friends, dipshit. 
Although I admit that I'm enjoying helping people who aren't idiots, and "get it" when it comes to certain key concepts. Which you have clearly shown that you don't.
Here's a thought... 
Maybe you should think and do some fucking basic research before posting utterly stupid questions on a public forum?? Consider that next time. 
 
@_date: 2018-08-24 17:01:01
If the vast majority of people using BTC aren't having a problem, and idiots like you are, then yeah, you're the problem. 
But keep babbling you clueless dolt. It's hilarious to watch you double, then triple down on your utter stupidity. :D

@_date: 2018-08-12 22:00:01
Not gonna happen. Bitmain's ONLY real source of revenue now is BTC mining. BTRASH is a dismal failure, and the only reason the price hasn't totally tanked is because they're sitting on a shitload of it that they can't even sell. Jihan is not that stupid. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 09:04:53
If it weren't for Bitcoin, your shitcoins would be worth less than zero. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 15:10:04
You probably should read up on how smart contracts actually work. :)
There is a wide variety of mechanisms and strategies to handle/resolve disputes, including escrow systems, online arbitration (like what Bisq uses) supply chain/logistics verification on-chain, as well innovative concepts in development such as transaction insurance, key certificate ID (which can be used to blacklist fraudulent merchants) among many others. Way better than some outsourced bureaucrat having the last word on any chargeback dispute on Paypal, I can assure you of that. :)
@_date: 2018-08-06 11:03:47

Maybe he just wanted to know just how full of shit you are. You do realize that it doesn't take even a minute to check out your Reddit profile right? You make it sound as if it's some long bureaucratic process. :D
Then again, you're thick as shit, so it's not at all surprising. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:48:01
Sorry, I don't waste time explaining things to people who think that Bitcoin should change its whole architecture and functionality and then ask utterly stupid questions about it. If you want people like me to think that you know more than fuck-all, don't do that maybe?

Oh... Shut the fuck up already.
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:48:59

I can use my debit card that's funded by BTC, what's your point? If something goes wrong with the purchase, you can take it up with Ebay's money back guarantee, big fucking deal.
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:20:08
When it comes to dealing with banks, oh yeah, I'm pretty absolute about it. I'm pragmatic about a lot of things, sure. Just not that. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:00:10
Nobody gives a shit about Paypal anymore. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:11:21
Oh, somebody's projecting again. :D
@_date: 2018-05-25 08:14:01
Shows how much you know about Paypal. 
The level of cluelessness I see out here about Paypal is simply mind-boggling. Did you know that Paypal used to pay money-market rates on funds that you kept on your Paypal balance? The only reason they stopped doing that was because the US Treasury department deemed them as being an "unregistered bank" working outside the confines of the FDIC. Especially when they started offering the credit line. So what did they do? They stopped paying interest on stored funds, problem solved. 
So yeah, get a clue. Paypal is WORSE than a bank, if that's even possible. :D 
@_date: 2018-08-24 16:19:09
Nah, you oughta learn how to use better wallets for doing transfers, etc., and not be an idiot just to save a few pennies. Quit your crying, you're embarrassing yourself. :D

I used to do tens of thousands of dollars a year volume on Paypal. Now I do zero. Watch Paypal die a slow,certain death as Bitcoin and other cryptos take over as more and more drop out of PayPal like me.

You must be an idiot or something, I just sent BTC for a whole 19 sat/b  (.0321 mbtc = .21 USD), and it confirmed in the next block. Literally within the past hour.

I stand corrected, had my Paypal debates mixed up. :D
 


No cherry picking needed. 


Uh... wrong, for many reasons. It's no secret that Paypal's business model is in grave danger of disruption. Even they know that, and trust me, they're scrambling. Remember when I said that I no longer do any volume with Paypal? I get emails about twice a month now from them, trying to kickstart me into taking payments with them, or even using my debit card. That's called... "desperation marketing". And, ironically, the last time I tried to use it, they locked me out of my own fucking account while traveling in Malaysia about a year and a half ago and caused me a world of problems, because they couldn't approve my identity over the phone. Because as many people on this thread have already stated, their customer service is downright abysmal these days. Mind you, I've had my Paypal account since 1999. 


indicator of only a company's growth, I can't help you.
You don't have to help me, Paypal's chart does that just fine. Look at the chart again, and you will notice that Paypal has been on an undeniably steady crescendo since it went public in 2015. No dips, no drops, no crashes, nada. Steady upward trend for over TWO STRAIGHT YEARS. Then... as I said before, in November 2017 that trend came to an abrupt end, and aside from a short-lived spike in Jan 2018 that brought Paypal to its all-time high, it's been trending steadily downward ever since. I'm not making that up, it's all you need to know. Paypal's growth has definitely stalled, and they're doing everything to can to maintain growth. 




Honestly? These figures don't impress me whatsoever. It's no secret that Paypal's user levels have tapered off in North America and Europe over the last couple of years. The only reason they still experience any "growth" is because they're aggressively going after developing world markets and users (who have significantly lower transaction volume), especially with their Venmo app. It's clear that they're trying to find all kinds of ways to lower costs while increasing profit. It's the only explanation for why they chose to dramatically change their rate and fee structure, while even REMOVING seller protection from certain types of transactions. Sending money to friends/family isn't cheap anymore either, especially when there's a currency exchange involved. And Paypal's currency exchange rates have ALWAYS sucked, now it looks like they're going to suck even more. 
So yeah, stop glorifying Paypal for fuck's sake. They've seen their best days, their model is only going to continue to implode as Bitcoin and cryptos continue to eat away at them, and there ain't a damn thing they can do about it. They're as doomed as the buggy whip, deal with it. :)
@_date: 2018-05-19 19:49:34

You're sharing batshit, topped with paranoia. 
@_date: 2018-08-12 23:36:45

Sounds like you are the one who is offended. Remember what I said about sharp/pointy objects now! :)
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:47:32
He makes a clear argument against them. People should wise up and buy their own bitcoins and keep their own damn keys rather than subject themselves and their coins to the whims of some "managers". It's utterly ridiculous. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 13:18:08
That's just it, he doesn't. He's winging it when he forms uneducated opinions, then spouts horseshit like calling Bitcoin "rat poison squared". He destroys his own credibility by saying that. And all it tells me is that he's going to miss yet another boom because of his own arrogance and yes... stupidity. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:15:24
Bitcoin is much more than a currency. Get a clue. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 10:20:06

@_date: 2018-08-05 21:38:50

Does that hurt? Good, it should. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 22:32:40
@_date: 2018-05-07 12:48:02
Why not? He's been quite wrong many times before. He totally missed the tech boom (the profitable one) of the late 90's/early 00's, because he basically thought that the internet was a fad. Just because he's good at one thing (finding and investing in companies that show long-term growth potential), doesn't mean he's a guru at everything. Let's stop putting people like Buffett on a pedestal that they don't deserve.

Wow, imagine that. Nobody gives a shit about your stupid opinion! :D
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:23:12
Because it takes time to implement systems, update software, and do their internal testing. More and more will deploy in the coming weeks/months, while others get ready. 
So how about you stop your bitching and FUD concern trolling? :) 
Go back to BTRASH's sub, stay there.

Yeah, imagine that, people having a certain degree of interest in Bitcoin not spending time on the internet to learn about it. :D
It's only been common knowledge for years now. Stop defending laughable ignorance maybe?

You could have found the answers on your own by simply taking the time and the initiative, rather than wasting time and space on this sub. 
This sub is not here to placate lazy-ass people who won't even bother to take the time research shit on their own. Really, it isn't.

Do you think that this kind of idiotic FUD hasn't been spewed around Reddit enough? Now we have to hear it from a dolt like you?
@_date: 2019-11-03 05:19:24
Plenty of ways to keep BTC private enough. Don't buy from exchanges, avoid any platforms that require KYC/AML bullshit, don't use closed source wallets, don't publicize your wallet addresses, trade P2P, utilize Lightning Network, and you'll be just fine.
Don't fall for the FUD horseshit.
@_date: 2019-11-06 16:36:18
Uh oh. Better call Bitcoin customer service immediately! This is unacceptable! :)

There doesn't need to be a "middle man". It's currency, it's an asset. All that needs to be done is to have a method of buying/selling peer to peer, and there are plenty of those. There's no way that governments can legislate what people do with their money in private p2p transactions. They can try, but they'll get their asses laughed out of most courts. Let's not get hysterical.

@_date: 2018-10-16 21:00:21


This coming from a guy who listened to a flat-earth idiot. :)


Really? That explains a lot of why you're in the red now, I guess. 


Nothing "religious" about what I know and do. You just seem to be lashing out and angry at the fact that some of us didn't make the same stupid mistakes you made. 
The fact that my significant other and I can live a great stress-free life while just earning more Bitcoin from the forex markets is proof that I kinda know what I'm doing. See, I'm not hoping for some "pie-in-the-sky" payday from HODLing, apparently you still don't get that. I'm getting my payday now on an almost daily basis. 
Seriously... you're demonstrating some pretty clear Dunning-Kruger traits right now, in flying colors no less. You should probably stop doing that, it's not doing you any favors. 


Uh... no I didn't. I never said that. Are you delusional or something? :)
When I bought my first Bitcoin, it was in the low triple-digits. Did I expect it to go up to $20K a couple years later? Nope. Did I cash out when it did? Nope. I didn't have to, and I had no desire to. The profits I've earned from my Bitcoin trading make it far more worth me keeping it in Bitcoin than in fiat. Crazy huh? 


I do, but that's not the point. :) 
Knowing and understanding Bitcoin the way I have come to over these years, makes its "price" of little relevance to me. Does this mean that I want the price to drop? No. But if it does, I'm not going to be adversely affected like you were or a bunch of people who are just praying that BTC will keep going up in the future. 
Make no mistake, it's clear to me that it's going to increase in the long term. But that's not why I own Bitcoin. :)


Dude, again, I never said that I bought it knowing that it would go up. It's price movement was not what motivated me to buy Bitcoin. I had other far more profound motivations than just looking for short-term profits. 
Are you having problems comprehending that?


Calling you out on your rather brazen ignorance doesn't mean I'm an asshole. You're the one who posted a rather asinine reply to mine, without actually even remotely understanding why I said that trying to trade Bitcoin for short-term profit is just plain stupid. I was trying to help you in as few words as possible, but you didn't get that.  
That's not my fault. 
 


And... that just means that you're missing the point of Bitcoin. So if you lose money (which you likely will with that state of mind) you'll have yourself to blame. 


You lost $40K because you sold your Bitcoin off at a loss. If you hadn't bought so much at one time, and instead bought a certain amount each month or so and kept buying using dollar-cost-averaging, rather than doing some idiotic "buy low/sell high" strategy, you wouldn't be at a loss the way you are now.  
You took bad advice, and it cost you dearly. Sorry to say. 
You looking at BTC as a way to extract more "dollars and cents" was your first real fatal mistake. You need to change your mindset, then maybe you'll get somewhere. If you don't you're just setting yourself up for failure yet again.  


Hopium... :D
Dude, stop lumping me in with your idiotic acquaintance and other "HODLers". I'm active with my Bitcoin, and living off the profit I'm making from using Bitcoin to leverage fiat, vs. the other way around. Which, may I remind you, is what YOU tried to do and failed miserably. 
And what do you now? You come on Reddit and solicit MORE bad advice about going long or short? Really??? :)
Wise up, don't make the same stupid mistakes again. 
@_date: 2019-11-18 13:57:32
Nope, just responded to your utterly idiotic post. And you apparently are very butthurt by the sheer ignorance that you displayed and got called out on.

It's really quite simple guys...
Stay off the exchanges when buying/selling BTC. Use p2p methods, avoid KYC/AML bullshit, use wallets properly, mix BTC regularly, et voila! Bitcoin can be as private as you want it to be.
Usage of LN will only bolster that privacy even more.
Do all that, and the only time that BTC can be tracked to you is if you use it to purchase something that will be titled or registered in YOUR name. Like a home, boat, stocks, etc.
And yeah, there are plenty of ways to get around that too.
I actually like Monero and think that it indeed has a place in the ecosystem. But it will NEVER top Bitcoin in usability, network effect, and other factors.
So the Monero crowd really should stop with the hysteria. It's pretty embarrassing to those of us who know better and only adds unnecessary FUD and confusion to newbies.
@_date: 2018-10-03 09:11:39
This is awesome. I love it, it will make getting businesses accepting BTC only about 1000x times easier than it already is. Good work!

@_date: 2018-10-16 20:22:58


Do you think I care? :)


It's not about "HODL religion", it's about understanding what Bitcoin is really for, and what the long term benefits are for keeping your wealth in Bitcoin vs. shitty, inflationary fiat. I've put myself in a great position of being able to profit from some of my Bitcoin, with MORE Bitcoin, without ever having to speculate on Bitcoin's price. If I tried to do the same thing with USD, EUR, or any other fiat, I wouldn't fail miserably. And I'd rather keep getting more Bitcoin with my profit than cashing out to any fiat on the planet, and it doesn't even matter to me what Bitcoin's current value is. I get the big picture. :)
People need to get off this ridiculous idea that Bitcoin is nothing more than a vehicle for profit from, and then converting that profit to bullshit fiat. That method of thinking is self-defeating, and people who keep thinking that are going to get REKT.


Your acquaintance is most likely an idiot. 
Well you bought into it with short-term goals while missing out on what Bitcoin will do in the long term. BTW, had you bought when I did, you'd be well in the green now even after the drop after its peak last year. I am, and I still haven't cashed out any of my BTC, other than what I'm using to live on, and I'm only doing that on the last mile of the transaction. 
As for your "acquaintance" and his "evidence". Please, spare me. Otherwise I suspect you'll tell me about chemtrails next. :D


Hahaaaa...I knew it. And I guess you still take your acquaintance's word on Bitcoin as gospel? Hilarious. 
Bitcoin is proving itself time and time again that it's not just the future. It's the money to be in right now. I walked away from fiat 3+ years ago and my life has never been better because of it. There's something to be said to have complete control of your finances and not be at the  mercy of any bank, government or other institution. There's also something to be said to have your wealth in an asset class that's not going to get eaten away by inflation at the rate of 3-5% a year (or more, depending on where you live). 
 


Speculating and trying to day trade Bitcoin is stupid. Especially when you have no fucking idea what you're doing, and depending on other idiots' bullshit TA, and especially since you don't even have to do it in order to benefit from it. 
If you can't figure that out, you should probably stop talking with that "acquaintance" of yours, your intellectual capacity may be suffering as a result. :) 
@_date: 2018-10-07 08:55:21
No. It's the money of today. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 11:58:39


Speed's never an issue for me. I use Bitcoin everyday. 


Insurance... what a fucking joke. Your keeping your money in any bank only allows banks to play with it at your expense, are you fucking clueless or what? All the while, exposing you to inflation that steadily eats away at your wealth. Banks and the central banking system are a huge reason why the global crash of 2008 was so destructive. You do realize that most people haven't yet fully recovered from that debacle right? Yet, here we are with another frickin' meltdown getting ready to happen, it's right around the corner.  
Seriously, get a fucking clue. You don't have any now. 


Bitcoin doesn't have to address any of the issues being created by a flawed economic model. Bitcoin just has to be Bitcoin. There are plenty of things that will just keep making it better and more capable, and even offer fraud protection. Smart contracts, Schnorr, RSK, and a lot more. Never mind that Lightning Network is growing like wildfire and becoming more user-friendly by the minute.  Stop your whining and do some fucking research. 


I'm objective to a fault, it took a long time for me to get convinced of the power of Bitcoin. 
However, unlike you, I don't pretend that the "fiat world" has any redeeming qualities nor is anything even remotely relevant to the future of economics. Fiat and central bank systems are a cancer on humanity. 
Developers are doing just fine with Bitcoin. All you have to do is look at how far it's come in less than a fucking decade. Quit your whining, nitpicking and armchair quarterbacking about Bitcoin. 
And if you want your arguments to be taken even remotely seriously, don't try to compare Bitcoin vs. fiat and say that Bitcoin needs to behave more like fiat somehow. That's a major credibility-killer. I'm laughing at your silliness. :D 
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:55:19

That's funny, I happen to see lots of "scams" and "pumps and dumps" on the stock market. Endless insider trading and manipulation, funny how almost nobody ever gets caught or prosecuted for that shit. 
As long as there are suckers and saps, there will be scams, pumps and dumps and other bullshit. It goes with the territory, and the space will do just fine in spite of it. Roubini is clearly scared of the new economic model being brought on Bitcoin, and he should be. Because it's changing everything, and there's no way they can stop it.

Uh no.... :)
It's the ease of set-up from a consumer standpoint. No tech/programming needed. Fill in a couple of fields, a couple of clicks and once the node is synced up, you're ready to roll. 
Now, anybody can do it from anywhere, and the cost is ridiculously low. I've already done it. It's so easy it's ridiculous. :)
BTW, this all rolled out only over the last couple of weeks maybe, so it explains why you probably don't know about it. But make no mistake, it is indeed a game changer. 
@_date: 2018-10-03 08:35:42

I've responded to your batshit arguments point by point. If anyone sounds like an uninformed newbie here it's you, Hansie. As for me, I've been all-in with Bitcoin for well over 3+ years now. I live off the profit I earn from trading forex with Bitcoin. I literally put my money where my mouth is when it comes to Bitcoin, which is a lot more than you can say, Mr. Fiat-fan! :D 
But hey,  enjoy the peace of mind that your shitty fiat currency gives you while it's "insured" in some bank's vault if that makes you feel any better. Me? I'm glad I'm finally done with banks once and for all. I've never had more financial freedom and autonomy than I do right now, and I don't depend on some government or some central bank to make the right decisions for my finances anymore. 
You're the one making utterly ridiculous arguments and points that are utterly laughable at best. Then you want to accuse me of being all over the place? 
 


I talk to serious devs all the time, you arrogant, assumptive dumbshit. I was in IT for over 20+ years. :)
@_date: 2018-10-14 06:31:41


I'm being more honest than you are. You just made a hilariously stupid argument that you couldn't even back up. 
Here's something that I learned over the last few years... Bitcoin doesn't have ONE single disadvantage to fiat. Fiat is a fucking sick joke whose time is at an end. Bitcoin, OTOH is constantly evolving and improving. It just keeps getting better.

What technical flaws that Bitcoin just keeps improving on? Are you fucking kidding? :D


Yep, there's that same bullshit "fiat" mentality again. It's not about "market share" dummy. It's about the inevitable transition and phasing in of a whole new concept of money and value, that puts financial control 100% in your hands. And no longer in the hands of some bullshit corrupt central bank, government, the crooked global banking industry, or any other party that not only wants to control what constitutes value, they want to exploit you with that control. 
One thing I gotta say is that I've been free from that system for almost the last 3 years, and I will NEVER go back to it. Bitcoin delivers a level of freedom and self-determination to me that I've never had before, and it's doing the same for millions of other people. I'm happier, freer, and more financially secure than I've ever been.  
And no... it ain't going anywhere. :)
 


Actually, you're the one falling for both of those things. You're following the herd that "bitcoin is doomed", when that's not even remotely true, and you're letting your own biases determine what you want to see. I have no illusions about Bitcoin, it's not perfect. But compared to the bullshit fiat-based financial system that exists now, it's fucking divine. :)

Not just me, plenty of other people are doing it.
u/ehanoc is right though, you're closed-minded and condescending. 
Oh, because you say so? Who died and made you judge? :D


That's not hypocritical, that's smart. Trading forex with a completely independent base currency that's anti-inflationary, and doesn't react to the same market forces as other currencies gives me a distinct advantage. And you want to know the crazy part? I show people how to do the same thing for absolutely nothing. :)
 


Wow, so good of you, does that make you close-minded too? :D


And that's quite simply bullshit. HODL'ing for long term is a no-brainer. You don't have to put your whole life savings into Bitcoin, but putting in a good percentage of it, which can gradually grow to a bigger percentage over time, is a wise decision on so many levels. But in order to get that, as I said before, you have to get out of the "fiat" mentality of money, and understand that whatever fiat you keep long term, is just going to get eaten away by inflation and devaluation. Bitcoin, will not, and if you leverage it to exploit fiat (like I do), then it will pay off in many other ways. 


I'm not trying to convince anybody of anything. The wisdom of the decision that I made 3+ years ago has shown itself to be self-evident on many levels, and NOT just because BTC hit almost $20k late last year. The fact that I've been able to take my forex trading to an entirely new level, with virtually zero risk is just one of many benefits that I get from Bitcoin. And I'm not doing anything extraordinary or crazy, anybody can do what I'm doing. 
So tell me, how is it "selfish" of me to want to help other people do the same thing I'm doing, and for zero cost? Explain it to me.

Yes, it is. It also means that you can exploit any remaining benefits of SEPA without surrendering any money to a bank. Crazy concept, eh?


I'm not afraid of inflation, it doesn't affect me anymore. It hasn't affected me in going on three years now. Trust me, I see the difference before and after. :)
But the fact that you clearly show here that you have absolutely no idea of what you're talking about shows me that you should. Stocks/ETFs as a hedge against inflation? :D :D :D :D :D


Ok, you know ratty-boy, you're only proving your ignorance more and more the more you blather on. We're talking about BITCOIN here, we're not talking about other crypto. Quite frankly, I don't give a rat's ass about other crypto other than to just make more bitcoin off them in the short term. Not "everyone" has to use Bitcoin in order for those of us who know better to benefit from them. You want to cling to the ignorant masses, of which you clearly are a part of as displayed by your sheer ignorance and ineptitude on this comment thread? Be my guest. Good luck with your euros. :D


Bitcoin is scaling just fine, thanks. That short period where fees were artificially high was due to a transaction spamming campaign on behalf of the BTRASH'ers. And guess what? It failed. And even then, with the right knowledge, there was no reason in the world that anybody had to pay bloated fees. I always paid well below average, even then. :)


Yep, you're an idiot. :) Adoption is dying? Are you fucking kidding? Dude, you've proven yourself to not only be utterly ignorant, you're a FUDster. You have no clue. :)


Yep, you have no idea what you're talking about yet again. Keep slathering on the ignorant FUD though. :)


When customers see the availability of LN with merchants (which is a growing trend, whether you want to believe it or not), and that all it will take for them to take advantage of it is a simple app like Eclair, among many others coming down the pike, you can rest assured that they will jump all over it. The younger generations are well-tuned into Bitcoin and paying with it, even if you're not. They are the ones that will move it forward, not horse-and-buggy thinkers like you. 
But hey, good luck with your euros and your lightning-fast SEPA. :D
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:41:45






Um... yeah. You apparently don't know much about how the Euro has slammed the more vulnerable economies in Europe. Greece isn't the only one having issues with this, btw. Italy, Spain, and Portugal are all struggling with the Eurozone. It's because the Euro was poorly conceived, the more vulnerable member states are taking a huge hit, things are bursting at the seams, and it's not going to get better any time soon.  






Wow, the more you babble, the more of an idiot you show yourself to be. It defies science at this point. :D
Hey... idiot... people saw their pensions vaporize during the '08 crisis, and are still only getting a fraction of what they're supposed to. 
They didn't just get all their money back when the markets recovered. People who had equity in their homes saw their equity disappear due to a massive valuation decline in the real estate market, and in many places in the US, the market still has yet to recover. 
Why? Because many areas are flooded with foreclosed properties that have deteriorated real estate values for everyone else living in the same areas. In other places, real estate ownership is mere fantasy due to total lack of property availability at any affordable prices. This shit is just scratching the surface. The US recovered fairly well over the Obama years, but still has a ways to go to undo the damage that still affects millions of people. The EU is only better off in certain places, while other places like Greece, Spain and Italy are still struggling.
You have no fucking clue about what you're talking about. That's even more self-evident than before. 


Says the 27 year-old who's never had to live through a war. :D


Yeah, see... Bitcoin never collapsed. You really don't want to get that. 
Despite the onslaught that cost the BTRASH'ers and their idiotic miners tens of millions of dollars to "collapse" Bitcoin so they can take its throne... they failed miserably. BTC remained functional, resilient and withstood the attack and kept improving. And what you don't understand about Bitcoin, because you're clearly a fucking idiot, is that it's anti-fragile. Every time there's an adverse action against the network, the network gets more resilient and stronger. 




It's only nine years, and no, adoption is not going backward, no matter how much you wish it to be so. Sorry. :) 
The adoption may be very well taking a different route than it was originally on, and that's quite alright, because there was never a "blueprint" or roadmap for Bitcoin's growth to begin with. Its growth, and current global domination occurred 100% organically and because of its community. Bitcoin isn't going anywhere, and you may want to just accept that. :)
 






Yeah, the pseudo-intellectual Euro-dolt thinks he can grade my English grammar here on reddit. :D

Thanks for the lesson, Dad. :D


Bitcoin evolves over time for the better. 
It has an active development community that keeps making it better. It's why we have Segwit at almost 50% adoption, it's why the blockchain runs more efficiently than ever. It's why Lightning Network will eventually be too good a deal for merchants to ignore. All of these things happen because Bitcoin is malleable, yet firm in certain aspects of its design. Again, there isn't going to be another truly decentralized coin or platform that will rival Bitcoin for a very, very, very... long time. Deal with that fact, cry if you have to. :)
@_date: 2018-06-24 00:07:35
You again? Geez, I'm glad I refilled my tea... 
Ok Dunning-Kruger boy, let's do this one more time... :D






Bitcoin doesn't have to. 
It's by its own nature and design an anti-inflationary currency/store of value that can't be controlled or manipulated by any government or party. Its value is based on PoW and true scarcity. I know you're pretty stupid, but if you think hard about this for say oh... two or three days... you should get it. :)
Then again... :/


Yeah, you're just going to keep saying the same stupid shit, when it's plainly obvious that you have no idea of what you're actually talking about. 
BTW, I probably mentioned that I spent a couple months in Greece this past spring before. Do you know how many people (and *gasp* business owners) are using Bitcoin to hedge themselves from the ravages that the Euro is wreaking on their personal and business financial states? At least 20 people in Athens alone told me that without Bitcoin, they'd be in utterly dire straits.
Imagine that...  






Hey Dunning-Kruger boy... 
First of all, we were talking about what happened during the crash of '08. That was THREE YEARS before 2011. Just admit that you're an idiot, you're full of shit and you got it wrong, and now you just want to move the goalposts. 
Second of all, gold increased year over year (as did silver) and leveled off in 2012 at under $2000/oz . It didn't drop in price in any real way until MID 2013. So you see? You're still utterly full of shit, you're a clueless moron, who just babbles about stuff without having even remotely any idea of what you're talking about. 
And then... when you get called on it, you fucking DOUBLE DOWN with more stupidity! :D :D :D 
Sorry, but this is utterly hysterical. Your stupidity truly knows no bounds. 
 






Give "concrete examples"? To you? A fucking moron who hasn't got a clue? Do some fucking research you lazy dipshit. Sorry, it's not my job to educate your pathetically stupid ass, and yeah, I have better things to do, I've called you out on enough of your bullshit. This isn't even a debate anymore dumbass, as if it ever was. Because quite frankly, from the beginning I felt like I was debating with a pre-schooler. Now, it just seems like I'm debating with a retarded toddler who's pissing all over himself.  
Now, this is nothing more than just a celebration of how high your moron-chart reading can still go. :D






You seemed to care enough to try to make it into something else before. That didn't work, now you want to say it doesn't matter? :D






Oh back to the failed frat-boy idiotic retort. :)










This coming from the "discrete mathematics" graduate. :D 
Yes, I know how Bitcoin works better than you do. The fluctuating volumes of incoming transactions is what the mempool is for, it's where transactions wait to be processed. Bitcoin can easily handle massive influxes of transactions in surges and bursts and STILL manage to keep the mempool fairly empty the vast majority of the time. I've seen the mempool fill up to 10,000+ transactions within 20 or so minutes, and be back down to under 2,000 after just three or four blocks are mined. 
This translates to transactions paying a 1 sat/b fee waiting around 30-40 minutes for a confirmation (if that), while everybody else's transactions paying a bit more (say 2-3 sat/b), get processed within 1-2 blocks. This means that the network can handle major volumes and stay efficient. 
You clearly have no clue about how Bitcoin works, and the more you blather, the more of an idiot you paint yourself to be. 
 






You keep saying the same shit, without understanding that you're not making an argument. There are still plenty of major companies still using Bitcoin. Overstock.com, Cheapair, are just two examples. 
And again, it really doesn't matter how or when companies adopt Bitcoin. It really doesn't. The adoption path that it takes is not going to be the one you think it should be. It still doesn't matter. Sorry. :)






Yeah, because everybody under 30 buys video games on Steam like you. :D
 






I don't have to "buy" fiat to do it. It's an instant exchange done on the fly. :)
I just load BTC into my Wirex wallet, and whenever I want to make a purchase with fiat, I simply tap on my app for whatever amount, I want to make available in EUR, et voila! 
 










I'm not shilling anything, dumbass. I've disputed and disproven your batshit to the point of ridiculousness. The only reason I'm still on this thread chatting with your dumbass, was because I needed to see just how much higher you can ratchet up the stupid meter. And congratulations! You've done a stellar job! :D :D :D 
 


Yeah, I'm going to take life advice from a loser who doesn't know his asshole from a hole in the ground. Nah, I'll pass. But I'll give you some advice, don't try to debate on stuff you know nothing about. Your idiocy will be less visible.

Wow, you just really don't know how to check your stupidity, do you?
Dude, you are a textbook case of the Dunning-Kruger effect in action. *slow clap*. I'm in awe.  
Hey DK boy...  
You may want to check the annual price charts for gold and silver before, during and after the '08 crash before making another asinine statement like that. Because uh... gold and silver didn't crash like the stock market and real estate did. Silver did take a dump 3 years later, gold... not so much. 
But man... that was spectacularly stupid. Bravo! :D


Yet another idiotic absolutist statement based on absolutely nothing, by Europe's  Dunning-Kruger poster child. :D






Yes, and much of those very problems were aggravated by economic inequities that were wrought on their respective national economies after implementation of the Eurozone. Let's not even get into the problems that the Eurozone caused them. :)
You should do YOUR homework, because you clearly have done none so far. 
But hey, tell me again how gold and silver crashed again in '08! :D :D :D :D






Hopefully your stupidity isn't contagious, because it's exactly that kind of stupidity that causes wars, particularly in places struggling with various kinds of extremism, nurtured by sheer ignorance and stupidity. 
Places like... *gasp*... Europe and the US. :O
 






Talk about shitty grammar. Looks like Dunning-Kruger boy is unraveling... :D
It's not a conspiracy moron, it was plainly obvious as to who was doing the transaction spamming and why. Grow the fuck up. 


Hmmm...  I managed to use it just fine with little or no problems. Did I have to pay a bit more of a fee? Sure. Still managed to keep my fees well below average (because unlike you, I'm not an idiot) BTC always served my purposes and never failed me. 
Does that make you sad? :(


Where did you read that moron? :D 
Bitcoin is easily handling far more than that. You clearly have no idea how Bitcoin works, along with all the other shit you don't know. :D 
There was a theoretical ceiling of 7 transactions per second that was set there on purpose to keep the blocks a uniform size and allow the development and community to manage growth. All that happens when there's more transactions than can be handled is that the mempool gets backed up a bit. 
I've seen transactions hit 60-80tx per second on Blockchain, and the mempool ends up being empty again within an hour or two. You're babbling nonsense. And with the LN layer, it will be able to easily handle even more transactions without any real limits.  






Yep, you're unraveling before our very eyes. Your fingers are going apeshit all over your keyboard. :P
And no... most "big companies" haven't abandoned it. Do you read anything ever? :)






Yeah, the future of Bitcoin depends on whether or not you can buy Steam games with it. :D :D :D :D 


I can buy Reddit gold just fine with Bitcoin, via my debit card. :)


I doubt you've been able to dress yourself since last December.

Deflation only happens when there's not enough supply of a fiat currency to adequately circulate. That's never going to happen with the EUR. This has nothing to do with anti-inflation, which basically undoes the damage inflicted by inflation from previous periods.

To me, Bitcoin's biggest strength is everything you talk about in your post, and the fact that it can be leveraged and utilized in so many ways vs. fiat to anyone's advantage. The more imaginative ways people find to utilize Bitcoin to overcome their dependency on fiat and the banking systems of the world, the better off this world will be, especially when it comes to the developing world.

Banks are banks no matter where you are. European banks, while granted are more regulated than US banks, are still crooked as shit.  
Germany huh? Ever heard of Deutsche Bank? Tell me that they're not a bank, even though they have the word "BANK", right in their fucking name. 
Hmmm... wonder if any of Deutsche Bank's esteemed officers went to prison for that shit. Mind you, there are far more where that came from. 
So again, maybe you should educate yourself before babbling idiotic shit out here? 
Maybe? :)

Bullshit. Banks are institutions that have evolved over time to scam the masses while benefitting the privileged. Don't believe me? Look at how many times banks have been busted for blatant crimes (money laundering, one example) and fraud (manipulating forex and LIBOR) in just the last decade. Stuff that would send you or me to prison for LIFE. 
Then, look at how many bankers who knowingly perpetrated those crimes got charged or convicted, much less lost their fucking jobs. It's all you need to know. 
Case fucking closed.

I do. :)
I have a couple of sweet debit cards that handle the "last mile" of the currency transaction in any currency I want with instant conversion, no bank needed. Before this card, I used a prepaid debit card that I easily loaded from my exchange. But thanks to my new debit cards, it's pretty much obsolete, and I keep it as a backup now. 
What else do ya wanna know?

I know all about SEPA, and Bitcoin still makes SEPA obsolete, sorry. I paid 2 cents for my last BTC transfer yesterday, confirmed in all of 4 minutes. I have never seen that kind of speed/performance with SEPA, and my GF is Italian, btw.
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:57:28
Correction, not "almost always" they ALWAYS get confirmed. Funny how businesses that don't blink at taking a check that can take as long as 5-7 days or more to clear their bank, but people think that they'll cringe at having to wait 10-20 minutes for a transaction to confirm. Literally EVERY business owner that I've talked to and/or dealt with around the world that takes Bitcoin (I'm talking all over Europe, Asia, Australia and Latin America over the past few years now) doesn't give a single shit about confirmations. Once they see the transaction show up in their receiving wallet, they're happy. Go figure. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:11:24




Yes, that's how it works in Europe, until it stops working, which it will. :)
Eventually, the Euro will become overwrought due to rampant inflation, debt and the lack of a sufficient federalist level of EU government that will cause massive disarray. All the signs already point in that direction, and until EU makes some profound changes, economic calamity is quite guaranteed. 
 






It's not an insult if it's true. You're clearly proving that you're a lame, pseudointellectual dolt who thinks he knows more about something than he actually does. Don't worry, this 50-something college dropout who effectively retired at age 40 and now travels the world, knows your type. ;)
 


No, the available data shows that there's more transaction batching on behalf of exchanges (which prior to batching accounted for well over 60% of all transactions on the blockchain), and smaller blocks thanks to increased usage of Segwit (which is now at just under 50%) is making the blockchain more efficient. Transaction processing and bulk has become more efficient and streamlined. But hey, be an obtuse idiot if you think you know what you're talking about, if you feel you must. :)
 


The reasoning behind most of those companies dropping BTC had nothing to do with BTC's volatility, it had everything to do with the transaction spamming campaign perpetrated by BTRASH and its cohorts that caused fees to rise disproportionately for a few months starting in late 2017. They were doing everything they can to derail Segwit and try to show that BTRASH was the better crypto, and they failed miserably on both counts. Those companies will eventually figure out that it's to their benefit to take BTC directly, but even if they don't... who the fuck cares? I sure as hell don't. :)
 


Yeah, you clearly have no idea how any of that will work. Keep talking, moron. :)
 


Uh, sorry... if you speak for any segment of your generation, it's likely for the obtuse-pseudo-intellectual dolt set, because quite frankly the vast majority of people under 30 that I talk to do not think the same way you do. Incidentally, my gf is 30, and the smarter segment of her fellow masters candidates know and understand what Bitcoin is all about, and know it's the future. Go figure. 
Keep babbling idiot. :)

Yeah, I bought almost 3 years ago. Guess what the price was then? :)
Oh, and... I make money with Bitcoin no matter whether its price/value goes up or down, by exploiting forex with it. Crazy huh? 


Pedantic strategy.... :D
The reason that YOU don't get it, is that because you still think of value in terms of the "fiat" world, vs. the new economy that's been brought on by Bitcoin. Breaking free of the "fiat" mentality is the first step that you have to take in order to truly understand why Bitcoin is so revolutionary, and why it hasn't even scratched the surface yet. Keep looking at Bitcoin as just an "asset", and yeah, you'll keep missing the boat. 
But don't act like you know what you're talking about, when you have not a single clue. :)

Read up, again... economists agree that anything OVER 2% is adverse to economic health. The fed inflation target is ALWAYS around 2%, because they know that it's going to end up hitting around that anyway. They just don't want it to go over (it's currently  2.8% for the last 12 months ending May, btw, that's BAD.) 
If you look at the average inflation rate over the last century, it's well over 3% and has been in the double digits SEVERAL times over the past 30 or so years. It's important to understand the damage caused by inflation carries over year to year. It has a cumulative effect. It's not like everything starts back at zero every fiscal year, it doesn't work that way. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 23:12:32


Nope, not a banking service. I don't need a bank account to have a prepaid debit card. Visa isn't a bank, it's an electronic payment platform. :)
 




Let's see, started out with Bitcoin when it was still in the low-mid triple digits just over three years ago, been profiting from Bitcoin by using it as my base currency for forex trading over the last 2.5 years... have accumulated even more bitcoin from my trading since then... continue making profit from my trading no matter which way the price goes...  and I only "sell" when I want or need some shitty fiat for a specific purpose or need (which is quite rare these days).
What have I lost exactly? :) 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:52:30
Funny how shit like that has NEVER happened to me when paying for stuff with Bitcoin literally all over the world for going on the last almost 3 years now. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 20:30:29


Oh trust me, it's bad in the US. Bad to the point where someone earning minimum wage can't afford to pay rent for a 2-bedroom apartment anywhere in the country. And with inflation inching up, and wages staying stagnant, and a buffoon of a president that's in power, it will only get worse. 
As for the EU, the economic balance is clearly visible. Spent a couple of months in Greece this spring. A liter of skim milk costs 1.60 euro. 200g of smoked salmon costs 7 euro. I'm currently in Spain, where milk costs .50 euro, and 200g of smoked salmon costs 2.50 euro. 
Get it yet, oh master of discrete mathematics? :D


Yeah, tell that to the people who lost their asses in the 2008 global economic crash. The people who got burned the worst? Real estate and stock investors... womp womp... 
It's hilariously you think that something is fact, because you say so? You're an idiot who can't debate your way out of a paper bag, you think that by just making absolutist statements like this that are positively stupid, that you somehow gain intellectual ground?
Wow, you're even more of an idiot than I originally thought. :)
And nobody's talking about "global breakdown" idiot. What I am talking about is that the current financial system is not sustainable. It will have to evolve to one that doesn't suck people dry to benefit a scant few and an industry of crooks, and Bitcoin is indeed the catalyst of that evolution, whether you like it or not.  






If you're going to resort to lame frat-boy retorts, you really should say them right. It's either "Cool story, bro" or... "Cool story, dude". For once, do something right, because so far your discussion and debating skills have been nothing short of a dismal failure. 
  


I did, in response to your horseshit. :)
 
 


Yeah, wrong. The BTC network is an entirely different animal now than it was just six months ago. Never mind that it's proven itself to be fault-tolerant, considering that the network continued to function despite the onslaught. You're just too much of a gullible idiot, you fell for FUD and now you want to think that the FUD is gospel. 
And yeah, it's pretty pathetic. :D
 






The adoption will come on its own. It will happen in fits and starts, not in a straight line like people you think it should. But the fact that I don't have to wait for "wide adoption" in order to benefit, profit and yes... USE Bitcoin is self-evident. People can use it as their primary store of value and main currency right now if they want to, like I have been doing for oh... the past 2.5 years now. And you know what? It just keeps getting better and better. Once you realize that the day to day valuation is completely irrelevant to why you're using and accumulating BTC, the whole game changes. 
 






At least you agree that you're a clueless moron, we're making progress! :D






Yep, back to the lame frat-boy retorts, and you still couldn't get it right the second time.

@_date: 2018-06-22 16:56:11


Oh FFS, stop it. I seriously guffawed at that. :D
Claiming that banks are "still needed" because of the alleged speed of SEPA on a ridiculously anecdotal video is nothing less than hilarious. 
You fail to understand that whether you know it or not, you're paying for your bank in a barrage of hidden ways. Though a SEPA transaction may be "free" for you,  using a bank account is anything but. You pay for the ability to do those transactions in all kinds of ways. :)
Here's something else, you don't even NEED a bank account to take advantage of SEPA. 
My Italian GF has all the benefits of SEPA with a prepaid debit card that she got at the Italian post office, which all includes its own IBAN, online interface and app. 
And guess what else? It's STILL obsolete thanks to Bitcoin. :D 
Why? Because we no longer need to send funds via a centralized system that is based on shitty inflationary fiat. We have complete control of our money, and how we use it. 
We are not at the mercy of a bank that insists on knowing how we're using our funds and where the funds are coming from. We no longer pay ridiculous currency exchange fees when we travel, just for the privilege of using another country's fiat. If you ask me, all that freedom is most definitely worth the mere pennies I pay per transaction. If you can't figure that out, it's only because you don't want to. 
 
And just one more thing ratty... :)  
With LN now a reality, the only thing that's going to happen with Bitcoin fees is that they will just keep going down overall. 
LN is the next level and with continued adoption, there will be more and more smaller transactions happening there, leaving BTC's main blockchain wide open for meatier transactions. When merchants come to the realization that they can now accept payments of any size for next to nothing, and not have to pay their merchant bank ridiculous fees plus 2-5% of the gross transactions, it's going to be an absolute no-brainer for them. 
Thanks though, for showing us all just how little you really know about Bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2019-08-27 13:50:35

@_date: 2018-06-25 00:23:07
Dude, stop babbling ffs, and look at this chart...  
The volume in January '17 was artificially high due to the rampant spamming of the network by BTRASH miners and their ilk. DO YOU UNDERSTAND? What don't you fucking get? All you have to do is look at the volume before the spamming campaign ratcheted up (which started around Sept-Oct 17, and petered out for good early Feb '18). During that same time, Segwit was getting implemented, and some of the larger exchanges started batching transactions to alleviate some of the traffic congestion and save on fees. When the spamming bullshit ended, the transaction volume naturally went down to a lower base threshold because the network was more optimized due to increased Segwit adoption as well as increased transaction batching. 
Do you finally understand now? Geez. If you still don't, just admit that you're a FUDster who can't stop his bullshit concern trolling. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 11:09:43


Uh, I think you need to learn what ad hominem means, because you clearly don't know. And yeah, if you're an Apple user, you're a sucker. Sorry if the truth hurts, you should work on not being a sucker. :)


Yeah, you're not doing much better if you use Windows too, though granted, you're not getting ripped off as much as you are by Apple. Ever heard of Ubuntu Linux?  :D


Because it quickly shows me what kind of consumer you are. Only people who are suckers will pay the ridiculous prices to own and keep a stupid Iphone. You pay hundreds of dollars more for a ridiculously overpriced phone than you need to, 'nuff said. You're a sucker, case closed. 


Nope, I was merely responding to your horseshit. :)
 


Oooh, can't wait. :P


Do some research, you clueless dipshit. I already know the data, it's not my job to educate you. 
In Venezuela alone, use of Bitcoin has skyrocketed. It's been used as an anti-inflationary hedge in other countries such as Zimbabwe and Argentina. And yes, the ripoff remittances industry has taken a serious hit thanks to Bitcoin over the last several years. So much so that they've lobbied their corrupt governments to push back against Bitcoin use. 
 


My response to you is hardly a rant, I am however, sticking to the facts. Which is more than you can say.  :)
 


Yeah, you should check the stats. Economists agree that any inflation over 2% a year has a long-term adverse effect on the economy. In the US, it's been an average of well over 3% for going a century now.  Let's not even get into cumulative inflation numbers! :D  
EU is slightly better, but individual countries have seen double-digit inflation several times in recent history. All fiat is inflationary, and that means no matter what, your purchasing power will decrease over time. 


Yes, it's a way to leverage a legacy system to enable easy payments with Bitcoin, without needing a bank. Why should I complain about that? Visa isn't a bank, it's a platform that merchants and consumers use to facilitate electronic transactions. Utilizing fiat to complete the "last mile" of the transaction is smart, especially since it costs me nothing. And even better, I'm not even the one paying Visa to utilize the platform, the merchant is, to the tune of 2-5% of the gross transaction. :)


I pay directly with Bitcoin all the time, particularly online. The point of my example was to demonstrate the way I do transactions at a grocery store on the same level (if not easier and cheaper) than you. Try to keep up. :)
 


LN is still in early adoption, you clueless, pseudo-intellectual dolt. 
It's still being rolled out. The mainnet is indeed active, new channels and nodes are being added by the day, and yes, businesses are coming aboard and many more will do so once they realize that they will save on merchant fees, won't have to worry about chargebacks and there is literally NO downside to accepting LN payments. 
Look, I travel the world full-time, and I talk to business owners all the time (including many who already accept Bitcoin), and yes, LN is coming, rest assured of that. 
I've done quite a few small transactions with LN and Eclair and it has worked flawlessly every single time. My wallet is loaded and ready to use whenever it will be to my advantage to do so. In the meantime, no problem, my debit card and paying BTC directly to sites like Cheapair.com is fine with me. And honestly, I don't even care about using legacy systems to pay via Bitcoin, because quite frankly, it's quite easy, inexpensive and convenient. So let the adoption curve take as long as it needs to, I'm in no rush. :)  


Oh, it's already happening. Sorry if you're missing it. :)


I haven't been blabbering, I've been walking the walk for the last 3 or so years. Does that make you sad? :(


What issues? It's an adoption curve, and Bitcoin has only been around since 2009, you clueless dolt. :)
And again,  who fucking cares how long it will take for businesses to mass adopt it? They eventually will, and it doesn't even matter how long it takes for people like me. Remember when businesses wouldn't accept anything but cash? Oh wait... I still run into businesses that don't accept cards, in 2018! And they're still in business for fuck's sake!  
So what was your fucking point again? Oh yeah, you didn't make one. :)
 


If you pull your head out of your ass for more than a minute, you should be able to figure out the stark difference between an anti-inflationary currency like Bitcoin vs. shitty, central-bank-manipulated, uber-inflationary fiat. If you can't figure that out, then don't worry, it explains why you're an Apple user, I get it. :)


Dude, I've run several businesses and companies over the course of my life, and the one thing I learned was this... always make it as easy as possible for your customers and clients to pay you. 
Bitcoin is the ultimate when it comes to easy payments. Especially since there's no intermediary needed, the merchant gets their money within a matter of minutes (rather than have to wait 3 to 30 days to see it show up in their bank account via their merchant processor) and don't have to surrender a chunk of their sales for the privilege of accepting electronic payments. 
Quick story: A store owner I met in Malaysia told me that accepting Bitcoin saved his business, because it dramatically improved his cash flow, and he was no longer at the mercy of waiting for his merchant bank to deposit his proceeds every other week. He's also managed to build a capital reserve with Bitcoin that he controls, not any bank. Just one example of many from around the world. 


Only an idiot would ask that question. Congratulations. :)

The mere fact that you're responding to me with the same utter horseshit that you OP'd is all the evidence that's needed to prove that. You have absolutely nothing else. :)


It wasn't hyperbole at all. But I am quite happy that you're annoyed by me in any case. That's the whole point of me replying to your abysmal grade-school level trolling. So yep.. Mission accomplished. :)


I'm most likely older than you, moron. 


Nope, not at all. Healthy discourse and discussion about Bitcoin is fine.  
If anything, I'm amused by your ignorance and stupidity. Even more so now that I'm annoying you. :)


I don't look at Bitcoin as an investment. It's a financial revolution. A total game-changer. The fact that you see it as nothing more than an "investment", while still babbling like an idiot, speaks volumes. Your lack of comprehension of what Bitcoin is actually all about, even at this stage is hilarious.

In fact, people in the developing world who have been at the mercy of ridiculously inflationary currencies due to the fact that their country's central bank is essentially a mafia operation, are doing just that in droves. And for the vast majority of them, it's a matter of economic survival. 
It's just a matter of time before that awakening "trickles up" to the people (even Apple suckers like you) who may have thought that they were more advanced and savvier in the first world. Only to learn that they too have been getting screwed just as much. 
Anybody can do what I'm doing, within a matter of DAYS. It takes investing just a little bit of time to learn and understand the powerful leverage that bitcoin gives you, everything after that is easy. Especially since these days, all you need is the right kind of debit card and app to make Bitcoin do everything that you want it to without having a bank rip you off, and depending on shitty fiat that will just continue deteriorate over time. 


Oooh... neato.... :O
With my Wirex card, all I have to do is wave my card by their contactless terminal, enter a pin, boom. Transaction concluded. No phone or device needed, don't even have to show my face to anything. :D
No bank needed, no intermediary, nada. They will eventually update the app to included contactless payment directly via the app, so you don't even need the card. I can instantly load it with as much EUR from my BTC wallet as I want, whenever I want, no exchange needed. 
With LN, I can pay via my eclair wallet the exact same way you're using your cute little app, and the merchant will save 2-5% in merchant fees to accept my payment that way, so you can rest assured that more and more merchants will be accepting it as an alternative to Visa/MC/Amex for that reason alone. You can rest assured that you will see more and more merchants taking LN payments over the coming months and years. There is literally NO downside, it's only a matter of time. 
But hey, enjoy your Apple Pay. :D :D :D :D 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:47:58


Er... wrong. :) 
Doing an instant conversion from Bitcoin to fiat on the "last mile" to facilitate a payment is still paying via Bitcoin. 
You know, kinda like if you're American and you're traveling in Europe and using a USD-based credit or debit card. You pay for whatever you're buying in EUROS, and the charge is then exchanged into USD when it's debited against your account. 
Still "paying directly" aren't you?
Buy a clue already. :D
@_date: 2018-06-01 14:31:08
People are spending and using BTC like any other currency. If you store value in BTC as opposed to gold or USD, it's still serving a worthy purpose. Money is not graded by how much it's "spent".

"keep money"
Bitcoin wallet, multiple crypto wallets, Bitcoin-based forex trading accounts, and hardware wallet for long-term BTC storage.
For fiat... prepaid debit cards, one I can load via my exchange, and a couple I can load directly with BTC and use any way I want. 
No bank account needed. :)
Next... 
Bitcoin wallet, multiple crypto wallets and if needed to do with fiat (which I almost NEVER do anymore), I use one of the debit cards. One of our prepaid debit cards has IBAN/SEPA so that's no problem if have to do a transfer that way, though that's extremely rare.
No bank account needed.

Yeah, no shit. 


Storing 100s of GBs of blockchain data on a mobile device isn't practical, and won't be anytime soon. With 5g, it ceases to become an issue. With such insane bandwidth availability between the device and the cloud solution where the blockchain data for the node will actually be stored (which IS practical), synchronization is virtually instantaneous and can be kept in virtual real-time so the node can stay current and sync'ed with the rest of the blockchain 99% of the time. 
But yeah, thanks for injecting your otherwise brilliant assessment. :)

Yet again, you reply and whine like a bitch. And why? Because you chose to proclaim your sheer ignorance and stupidity on a public forum. You're so shamelessly immersed in your civic stupidity, it's pathetic. 
But hey, whine a bit more about it. :)


That's exactly what an inept moron would say. :)
By the way, dumbass. I've haven't lived in the US in over a decade. I got tired of being surrounded by morons like you. :)

@_date: 2018-06-29 13:53:41


Um yeah, I hear them all the time. I can't help it that the vast majority of the ones spouting those views are either egregiously wrong, or seriously uninformed. :)
 


Bla bla bla... FUDsters have been saying that shit for years. In fact, it's one of the reasons why I didn't buy BTC the first time I looked into back in late 2010, early 2011. The FUD and doomsaying was insane back then. 
Since then, I've come to understand that the proof is in the pudding. Bitcoin has had literally every possible negative scenario, hacks, bad-actor, censorship attempts imaginable over the last 9+ years, and yet... it's still here. Bigger, badder and more antifragile than ever. 
So yeah, stop with the bullshit, ok?  :)


Adoption is something that will happen on its own, without needing to be forced. The adoption and usage of Bitcoin thus far has been strictly organic and based on a growing and more informed community. Guess what? That community will just keep growing, spreading and permeating into every other sector of commerce and the economy, and that's all it takes. I use Bitcoin almost every day in a variety of ways, and "adoption" has almost never been an obstacle for me. Why? Because I know how to "use" it to my advantage, and people who do the same will benefit just like me. 


Bitcoin isn't a "product". Thanks for proving yet again, that you are utterly clueless about just how profound Bitcoin is. 


Time will tell. Bitcoin is going to be around and a dominant economic force for a very, very, very long time. Until you accept that, you'll be on the losing end of things. So stick to fiat and central banking if you think that's the better horse to bet on. I really don't care. :)
 


Ah... "blockchain tech"... :D


Neither do I. Again, it's not my fault that people with "opposing views" are almost always utterly clueless about what Bitcoin is really about. I've been IT since the 90's-00's dot-com boom. I understand the technology, too thanks. But the concept of Bitcoin not only defines "blockchain tech"... it transcends it. 


I'm perfectly open to any "decentralized tech" that shows potential, sure. But let's face it, there is simply NOTHING out there that's been battle tested, censorship resistant, and truly decentralized like Bitcoin. There's a reason why BTC is the dominant coin in the crypto space, and that's not going to change for a VERY long time. Get used to it. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:31:01
Works fine for me, no matter what the value is, or how much it fluctuates. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:38:17


I'm not losing a thing, moron. I make money no matter what Bitcoin does. :D


It's not a bias, it's based on people's past experiences with shitty banks and their shitty practices. I'm nothing less than happy that I will never have to deal with a shitty bank again in any way, shape or form. My financial life is all the better for it, and I have more control and peace of mind than I ever did dealing with banks. 


I bought way more than that when it was still in the low-mid triple digits. I profit from BTC via forex daily. Do you really think I care of it goes up or down? Sorry, you must be projecting. :D 


I check the BTC price whenever I check what's happening on my forex trading, since BTC is my base currency. Again, it doesn't matter which way BTC goes. I'm making money no matter what. Too bad you can't say the same thing, loser. :)

Do people spend all the fiat money they have? 
Do you not get that Bitcoin is as much a store of value as it is a currency? People are moving their value INTO Bitcoin to keep it from getting eaten alive by shitty fiat. I know that's what I'm doing. 
As for fees and confirmation times, BTC is quite cheap to send, and confirmation times usually within 1-2 blocks (around 10-20 minutes) for around 1-2 sat/b. With Lightning, it's way cheaper than that. Your personal opinion sucks.  
So yes, when you stupid shit like this, it only shows that you are clueless. May want to work on that.

I haven't needed a bank in almost a decade. I used to be a major customer for BofA and Citibank until they tried to fuck me over during the '08 crash. I indeed told them to fuck off and moved my business to a member-owned credit union to handle my basic "banking" needs, which these days has boiled down to nothing more than a debit card and a checking account (which I almost never use anymore). 
Everything else I do has been handled quite beautifully with Bitcoin for going on FOUR years now. This includes living off of profits from my forex trading using Bitcoin as my base currency for going on three years now. 
So yeah, stop falling for bullshit. You don't need a fucking bank.

Oh, so now you think you can speak for most people, just because you're beyond ignorant about how inflation eats away at the value of your earnings as well as your purchase power? You're a special kind of self-important dense, aren't you?
 


Yeah, to who? Clueless idiots maybe. :)
BTW, Two things to your hilarious chart link:
1. It's based on data up to 2011. 
2. It doesn't take into consideration that the funds paid out for any stocks/etf's have had their own values degraded by inflation. That fact eats into the gross earnings by default. That problem doesn't exist with an anti-inflationary store of value, like... Bitcoin! :D 
 






I'm doing better than you are with your euros. Seen the value of the Euro lately? Geesh... :)


Oh, so Steem and Reddit determine whether Bitcoin is being adopted or not? You do realize that it doesn't even matter how many businesses adopt Bitcoin in a certain amount of time, right? That's not what determines its value. :) 


The reality is that you have no idea either, because many people are purchasing with Bitcoin using tools like I do to complete the last mile of the transaction. Again, what difference does it make compared to using a USD debit card in Europe to make purchases? It's the same exact thing you fucking dolt. Only I'm taking fiat out of the equation because the source of value is Bitcoin, not inflationary, shitty fiat. Too bad you don't get that. :)
 


You learned about discrete mathematics, and apparently didn't learn a fucking thing about basic, real world economics. Which to me, still means you're a clueless dolt. :)
 


CC? Paypal???? :D 
Hey loser... Smart contracts and p2p escrow systems resolve the chargeback/refunding issues, which for most businesses (at least ones that are competent) are miniscule. 
It's hardly a good reason to stick with a dying, antiquated, centralized system, rest assured. 
And just one thing, I've been a Paypal customer since 1999. I've had more unsecured credit lines and credit cards in my lifetime than you ever will. 
If someone like me can clearly see the stark difference between those now-obsolete systems and Bitcoin, and someone like you can't. It goes to show exactly who is the clueless one in this conversation. 
The younger generation looks at all the financial models of previous generations with nothing less than suspicion and disdain, and who the fuck can blame them? To them, it's quite obvious how much of a ripoff the whole scheme is. That's what happens when you're not indoctrinated with the same shit previous generations were.  
Rest assured that they are far more ahead of the curve and willing to evolve with BTC and crypto than you think, and that's what will push it forward. As opposed to trying to convince thick-headed, pseudointellectual dolts like you. :)
Give it up, dolt.

The price is the same no matter how you pay, whether it's cash or card, so it doesn't really matter, does it? The business still pays the fee out of the gross. And based on your argument, those who pay for purchases with cash are essentially giving a business another 2-5% in profit because they didn't demand a discount. :P
NOTE: In SE Asia, some places will add 3% or so to the bill to take payment via card, it usually ends up being a few more cents, in which case I'll just eat it if I don't have any cash on me, no biggie. :)

The IRS better make sure that they have their definition of "virtual currency" pretty down fucking pat. Otherwise, they're going to get their asses handed to them by the courts by a wide variety of legal challenges.

1. Responding to FUD, misinformation and other complete, utter horseshit with FACTS, logic, and rational arguments isn't "idealism". Sorry. 
2. The Bitcoin revolution has been happening for over 10 years, you're just apparently in too deep denial to get that. There are now millions of people around the world who get what Bitcoin is all about. And they will NEVER go back to the way things were before. That number will only continue to grow, as it is on a daily basis.
3. People who know and understand Bitcoin for what it truly is don't care about "driving the price up into the millions".
4. Funny how you claim that Bitcoin has "flaws". Yet you can't seem to owe up to the fact that it has withstood literally everything that has ever been thrown at it for over 10 years now. 
5. If you think Bitcoin is risky, no problem. Sit on the sidelines. Trust me, the rest of us won't give a shit. But you should probably also refrain from making an idiot of yourself on Reddit, commenting on a topic that you clearly know very little about.
Do yourself and us a favor. Get a hobby other than trolling Reddit. Because seriously, you suck at this. :)

Fees have been really low for quite some time. Segwit adoption is almost 50%, and transaction batching has streamlined the mempool. LN will take on a lot of the brunt of volume from small/micro-transactions. Bitcoin and fees will be just fine, calm down.

I've been sending 2-5 sat/b transactions almost daily for the last several weeks. They always confirm within 2-8 blocks no matter what the mempool is doing. On a couple of smaller transactions, I tested a small transaction by sending it 1 sat/b and it confirmed within 16 hours, when the mempool was over 30k at the time I sent. Unless it's an emergency situation where the BTC needs to be spendable asap, there is simply NO need to pay high transaction fees EVER.
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:53:37
It's obvious, isn't it?
@_date: 2019-06-20 11:56:43


Yep, you just tripled down on your stupidity, hilarious. 
Hey moron,some questions for you: 
1. When you get paid at the end of the week/month/whatever for working at your clearly unskilled/dead-end job, do you consider the money that you get paid an "investment"? 
2. If you travel to another country, (which I suspect you probably never have, because you're apparently too stupid to figure out how to get a passport), and you have to exchange your home currency to another currency in order for you to get that stupid souvenir to show off to your idiot friends that you went to Cancun, do you consider than an "investment"? Do you expect "returns" on that exchange?
Just answer the questions to yourself, and then connect the dots. Maybe then you'll realize just what kind of a clueless dipshit you've displayed yourself to be out here.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:09:50
You can use crypto to buy the first RE property, and then rollover using 1031 from that point on. 
You can put your crypto into a self-directed IRA, and then you have options for rolling over to other asset types.

@_date: 2017-11-29 17:15:05
Let's review your suggestions:


While being "debt-free" is always a good thing, it makes no financial sense to pay off loans' if the interest charges you're paying on those loans are less than the returns you're getting on the same money if you have it invested in something like... oh I don't know... Bitcoin? 


You can do this with Bitcoin without having to cash out. Best to do this to roll over profits from one "hard asset" to another, to defer taxes and diversify your investment portfolio. And sure, to buy a house to live in, but then again it may make more sense to take out a mortgage and keep your "money" working for you and against inflation by keeping it in BTC. 


No real logic to keep too much money in fiat. Especially since it's clear that BTC can quickly be converted to fiat within a few hours to a day, depending on which country you live in. Otherwise, you just have wealth that will erode away with inflation and currency devaluation. 


The best way you can help them, is by giving them bitcoin, and show them how it can help their financial future. 
The rest of what you advise is pretty condescending, sanctimonious bs. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:51:02

If you're so sure, then sell now and watch from the sidelines. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:02
No, it's ignorant to not even bother to understand what Bitcoin is all about, and what its true potential market cap is based on highly conservative numbers and sound mathematics. Do some research, or choose to stay ignorant and sell whatever BTC you have and watch from the sidelines, your choice.

These fluctuations have nothing to do with BTC's overall, long-term growth. You still have no idea of what you're talking about, and everything I said in my previous response is still 100% valid. 
But hey, enjoy buying the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:35:31


Someone's out of touch, that's for sure. 
As for challenges, Bitcoin has weathered an endless tide of challenges, only to become better and better after each one. If you don't see that, it's because you don't want to. 
As for usability, Bitcoin has multiple uses for different kinds of people. For some people, it will be a store of value, for others it will be a deflationary currency, and for others it will serve as a hedge against declining fiat currency and the ability to transact business in countries and regions with poor financial infrastructure. That's the beauty and real power of Bitcoin. 


Yeah, that's all nothing but pure, unadulterated FUD.

Plenty of options for buying RE via Bitcoin, and more will pop up as adoption spreads. A friend of mine just bought a $200k house with Bitcoin, the closing was a total breeze since there were no banks involved, and he easily saved over $5k in closing fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:08:32


It took 90 minutes to get 6 confirmations. First couple of confirmations came in around 5 minutes after the transaction was sent. And I've yet to see one business I've transacted with, ask me to wait for a confirmation, crazy huh?
 &gt;and you aren't going to pay $60 in fees for a cup of coffee. And yes that's entirely true given the current cost per transaction (click for source)
There's that same, tired bullshit paradigm, that if you can't buy a cup of coffee with BTC at all times, it's useless. Stop already. The only people who pay fees that are high are clueless idiots. So again, stop with the FUD.


People are using BTC and other cryptos in the developing world, and are actually being far more clever with it than you will ever know. . 


That's already happening with Segwit and Lightning Network. Other sidechain and layer technologies are in development and testing, the devs are WAY ahead of you on this stuff, don't worry. 


It's already "digital gold" and a lot more. 
And if you mean several altcoins, many of which will compliment and work well with Bitcoin, sure. Such as Litecoin (which will work great with BTC via atomic swaps and other tech) and even Ethereum, which parties might want to use as the platform for smart contracts, apps and other stuff, but may not necessarily want to use it as a base currency. Other altcoins will fill other niches and needs, sure. But they will never supplant BTC at least not any time soon. Not even BTRASH.

1031 exchanges are one way to do it, if you want to rollover one RE investment property's value over to another "like-kind" property. If you have an IRA, you have more flexibility and options to rollover assets from one type to another as long as they qualify within certain parameters. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:38:21

"Even though it’s tried to distance itself sufficiently via its subsidiary Libra and the association, many people will probably always think of Libra as Facebook’s cryptocurrency and blame it for their woes."  
Maybe that will be because it IS Facebook's cryptocurrency. Geez, what a shitshow this is going to be.

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:26:19




forever growing blockchain, 


Any "regulatory uncertainty" would apply to all cryptos, and those that are more centralized run much greater risk. 


Also FUD. Granted, an inordinate amount of mining happens in China and via Jihan's pools, but it's far from centralized. And with new mining hardware coming from Japan and Vietnam in the near future, it will become far more competitive than it is right now.  


Ok, that was just funny. 
You should just get over to r/btc, you will find your choir to preach to there.

It's ignorance like this that will keep BTC booming for years to come.

Nobody gives a rat's ass about shitcoins. This video essentially proves that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:53:27
Its deflationary nature alone makes it a prime store of value (like gold, but even better). Even Satoshi clearly stated this in the whitepaper. The great thing about BTC is it can be many things for different people, depending on their needs. It gives people full control of their wealth and finances in a way that doesn't subject them to the whims of inflation, currency manipulation and government corruption.
It's clear that it's the best possible investment anyone can make with their money, there's a reason for that.

You're the gullible fool. The majority of large-scale miners are either using hydro or geothermal power. That trend will continue, especially since solar and wind power are getting cheaper by the month. And yeah, it's far more efficient than anything the banking/finance industries are using to power their infrastructure. So just stop it. This is a total red herring bogus non-issue and you've fallen for it hook, line and sinker, because you're desperate for FUD. 
Bye now. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 21:43:35
Wrong. Renewable energy is pretty much at parity with FF and in many applications is even cheaper than FF. 
China's hydropower output increases year over year. They're currently at over 20% + another 7% for Solar/wind. They're scaling up on RE big time, and are slashing FF power at the same rate. 
China's coal production and utilization for power is dropping at an average rate of 3% a year, and that's expected to increase/accelerate over the next decade.

LN will be most important because it will give businesses, merchants and retailers the ability to easily run their own LN node/channel without having to know anything. LN is what's going to really bring on adoption on the commerce side. Focus on that for now, you can always deal with other coins later. If you can make it where it can retail for around $150-200 including some room for reseller/VAR profit (20-40%), you'll be on to something. 
@_date: 2018-11-03 12:56:47
If the guy's using a 3rd party's bank account, what's stopping that 3rd party from just setting up his own exchange account with whatever KYC required (if even needed to set up IBAN) in order to be able to utilize SEPA? 
And with BISQ, payment can be made to ANY IBAN. There's no KYC required.

And that's fine, I have Square. Not all merchants accept Square yet either. :)


You're converted to GBP the moment you deposit onto the card.
Uh... right, and I only dole out as much fiat to the card as I know I'm going to spend in a fairly short period of time. 
Again, I only do this when needed. If/when I'm able to pay via BTC directly, I do so. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:32:55
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:27:30
Sure... and even if it's true... so fucking what? The banking cartels launder more money than Bitcoin ever will in a dozen lifetimes. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:34:23


First of all, I use Bitcoin and ETH plenty directly with vendors and merchants pretty much everywhere I travel, let's just get that out of the way. The debit card solution is not a "lie", saying that was utterly stupid. I'm using fiat to suit my own purposes and the value of that fiat that I'm using is based entirely on profits that I've earned and generated in... *ding* you got it... BITCOIN. Therefore what you just said is utterly stupid. Until the system updates itself to a level where paying with Bitcoin or another comparable crypto is the default option, using legacy fiat for the "last mile" of a transaction only makes logical and fiscal sense, provided you do it right. 
 


It's efficient enough for me, thanks. If there were a decent crypto-based debit card that didn't gouge me in currency exchange fees, I'd be all over it. I looked everywhere, such a card doesn't exist. That's why I determined that this prepaid card is a good option for me for the time being, particularly since the money I'm saving in currency exchange fees is notable, and more than covers any other costs or loss of purchasing power that I may incur during that "last mile" of the transaction. 
Understand that I'm a full-time forex trader and crunch numbers all the time, coming up with this solution was an absolute no-brainer. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 19:37:26
Yes. You're crazy. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:30:08

@_date: 2018-03-02 13:33:37
Sure you do.
@_date: 2018-03-18 03:53:22


Yes, I'm well aware. However, until a card comes along that is competitive on the currency exchange fees, doing it the way I'm doing it now is a no-brainer. 


If it's a merchant I do business with regularly, sure. But for someone like me who's constantly traveling and dealing with new parties, not an option. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:45:55

I'm actually using a prepaid debit card that I load via SEPA from the Italian post office. It has no currency exchange fees (which saves us hundreds of dollars a year), and cost me 10 euro a year. Funding it costs me .09 cents every time I send money to it from my exchange. It's a beautiful thing.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:45:33
Until there's increased adoption, which is coming even faster now thanks to LN arriving on the scene, it's a necessarily evil to use fiat for the "last mile" of any transactions if you want to stay based in BTC or other crypto. I've come to understand this and have learned how to utilize debit cards effectively to complete transactions on my own terms using BTC. My gf and I travel all over the world and have learned how to effectively leverage fiat to our advantage by the use of debit cards. You just have to be smart about using them, and use the right ones that don't kill you in currency exchange and transaction fees.

Do it the right way, or don't bother at all. Reddit is hardly the place to present your bs scary scenarios. Devs are open to finding faults and vulnerabilities, and always welcome a new set if eyes and opinions in regards to an open source platform. 
So again, write up a paper, link it to the appropriate GitHub repo, or just shut up.

@_date: 2018-07-06 21:38:56
Here's the thing, opinions are like assholes, everybody's got one. If you're going to take the time post your opinion about something a way that raises questions or issues, it's best to do it in the appropriate venue. When you do it in INappropriate venues, then all it does is raise unfounded concern and... yes... FUD for no valid reason. 
I suspect that you probably know that your assertions are full of shit, but don't really want to get called out on that by real developers who know what they're doing. So instead, you'll post it here on Reddit to get some attention and stir some bullshit debate and... yes... increase FUD. 
Thanks for verifying to me that you're not willing to put your arguments to the real test. That proves that you are a pussy.

I too use a debit card for the "last mile" when needed. But I have found that using a prepaid debit card works better for me than any crypto-based debit cards I've seen. 
Currency exchange fees, loading fees, ATM-usage fees and the rest of the fees that they all seem to charge would add up to hundreds of dollars per year for me. The prepaid card my gf and I are using now is from PosteItaliane (Italian post office), no currency exchange fees. No ATM usage fees anywhere in EU, no loading fees, built-in IBAN (for easy/fast loading from my exchanges via  SEPA, costs pennies), easy web management, SMS-verification, paypass built-in, I can go on and on. 
I'm also eager to start using BTC/LN (I have eclair installed ready and waiting), and I do use BTC to pay for travel bookings, my apartment rentals, co-working fees, and many other services whenever possible. 
For now, like you say, that "bridge" is needed. But that will be less so the case over the next couple of years, I'm pretty confident of that.

It was essentially a debate which you lost, you clueless lowlife loser. 
To wit: You made an assertion that Paypal was cheaper to send $10 to someone than Bitcoin. Making the ludicrous claim that it must cost $.59 or more to do with BTC, when that hasn't been the case in several months, not even remotely.  
You then dug yourself deeper by trying to make a bullshiit ridiculous argument about "average" cost, when it's clear that the vast majority of transactions are paying the lowest possible tier on earn.com, which is 1-10 sat/b. Mind you, I'm not the only one out here who made it clear that nobody was paying anywhere near what you claimed, unless of course, they were either a sucker or an idiot, which you clearly are both. 
And that's why you lost, you stupid fuck. 
Now, just shut the fuck up already, ok?

Just ask the people of places like Venezuela, Zimbabwe and Argentina how practical Bitcoin is. 
Just because some people are speculating in Bitcoin, doesn't mean that Bitcoin is speculative, let's just get that straight right now. If you can't see Bitcoin's practicality and utility, that's your problem, not Bitcoin's. 
@_date: 2019-09-27 04:45:56

As someone who used to trade and deal extensively with gold I wholeheartedly concur. Bitcoin makes gold look like a sucker's bet. 
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:12:58
Hey dipshit. Give it up. You lose. That figure is calculated based on the fees that people are paying, based on the entire chart range. Because many BTC users pay from an exchange or a shitty wallet, they end up paying FAR higher fees than they need to. That's not BTC's fault, that's the fault of clueless users who don't educate themselves and end up being suckers. 
And guess what? That overall range figure affects this average to a degree that's laughable. Nobody goes by that figure or even gives it the time of day, except of course, delusional idiots like you. :D
All anyone who doesn't have his/her head up his/her ass has to do is look at the chart and see that transactions where people are paying their lowest tier range are getting their transactions processed within 3 blocks. Duh. 
So if you pay more than that fee for any reason, you're essentially just a moron who's paying miners more than they need to. It really is that simple, but hey, if you think that Paypal is a better deal, by all means, keep using it. And tell ya what... just keep your mindless-though-admittedly-amusing batshit off this sub, it's sludged up enough with utter stupidity as it is. :)

Here's the dirty little secret about gold. They keep finding more and more of it all the time. And now with technology, it's even easier to find gold sources now than it was as little as 10-15 years ago. 
Its "scarcity" is clearly in perception only by the market. The gold industry knows and understands that the illusion of scarcity is critical to keeping its value up. Rest assured that there is PLENTY of gold stored away by mining operations and brokerages that have yet to see the light of day to maintain that illusion of scarcity.  
@_date: 2018-04-28 23:10:16
Uh, it's not a fantasy. More and more people are getting it about Bitcoin, even if you still don't. Disruption (and then adoption) don't happen in a straight line upwards, it happens in ripples and waves.

Hey douchewad, one more thing. 
Go to  and you'll see that the VAST majority of transactions are paying fees in the 1-10 sat/b range (definitely closer to 1 sat) and are getting confirmation within 3 blocks. So who the fuck knows where you're getting your data about "average" and "above average" transaction fees . 
What a long, deluding coma it indeed must have been.. :D
@_date: 2018-04-23 12:45:40
Wow, have you been in a coma since last year? :D :D :D :D 
It's been cheap to send via Bitcoin for going on several months now. Nothing needed to be fixed. Just BTC being BTC, plus higher adoption of Segwit, transaction batching and the BTrashers finally giving up on spamming the network all the time. 
Get a fucking clue before posting idiotic shit out here. :D
 
@_date: 2018-04-23 13:04:37
Uh... Bullshit. 
Anybody paying "average" or "above average" fees is either a sucker or an idiot. And fees haven't been that high for quite sometime now. 
People who know what they're doing and spending with the right wallet are paying what I'm paying (I currently do around 5 transactions a week average), between 1 and 3 sat/b. For segwit transactions that comes to .015 to .043 USD CENTS. For non-segwit transactions, that comes to .0215 to .060 USD CENTS. I'm paying these fees and getting confirmation within 1-2 blocks well over 90% of the time, and have been seeing this over the last four months EASILY. 
So yeah, shut the fuck up, you're the misinformed douche here. :)
@_date: 2018-04-28 18:46:33
Oh, I know what you meant. Sick fuck.

Gold is not valuable as it is because of its "practical" use. It's valuable because of its accepted reputation as a "store of value". And yes, Bitcoin will definitely supplant gold in that regard. It's a lot easier to store and protect Bitcoin of ANY value amount than it is to store and protect gold. I used to pay hundreds to thousands of dollars a year for vault and gold transfer services and have to deal with ridiculous paperwork and processing. With Bitcoin, I can now move, transfer, trade and store it any I want to for mere pennies. Gold is now a dying relic, deal with it.

@_date: 2018-04-23 19:15:11
Change my tone? Yeah, right. 
I'm not trying to convince you or anybody else of anything. The facts speak for themselves. You're here arguing with conjecture and suppositions, while people like me (and LOTS of others) are indeed paying 1-3 sat/b right now, and have been for months. It doesn't get any more realistic than that, dipshit. 
Instructions on how to pay fees that low? Brain-dead easy. 
Get a GOOD wallet (like Electrum), use the slider control on the send screen to set the transaction fee to whatever fee you want to send (it will tell you how many blocks to confirm), then click send. 
Easy enough for even a barely literate buffoon like you to follow. I know, amazing. 
And now... go fuck yourself douche-loser. :)
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:32:24

I agree with Powell. Kraken opted out of doing business in NY over 3 years ago because of their Bitlicense. Yet, they now have to explain themselves to NY's AG? What the fuck is that all about? It's a move that was clearly designed to instill fear and intimidation on exchanges who for the most part just want to do honest business with US-based customers. 
The badly-run exchanges simply won't survive in the marketplace, and they will be subject to lawsuits and pushback by consumers if people aren't treated fairly.

That's the part that the fudsters don't get. People who pay the max fee push up the average fee across the board. It doesn't mean that you have to pay that, especially if you're not in a huge hurry for a transaction to confirm. I just sent a friend of mine some BTC yesterday, and it confirmed in about 12 hours. I paid 35 sat/b, total was about .40

Run it on a linux VPS. Then access it using a remote desktop app. It's better that way anyway, because Bisq only keeps your open trades on the books if you're online with it, and the VPS ensures that your Bisq app is always running. Works great for me.

Oh, thanks for that sage advice. The fact that you're still trying to pin me down as some kind of "conman" only shows that you are truly a Dunning-Kruger class idiot. And rather than just accept that you're not only wrong about Bisq, but also with your assertions about me, you're just going to keep doubling down on your stupidity.
Typical Reddit moron, I'll tell ya what! 


Funny how you try to lump me in with a bunch of people who are peddling shit, yet, I am not peddling a single thing. That bothers you doesn't it? It irks you, doesn't it? 
That someone who's successful is just trying to share the wealth with others in a true win-win scenario. You just can't seem to wrap your inbred-idiot brain around that concept, can you?


Keep your luck, you clearly need it just to find your way out of the house and to get to the bus stop. I'm good, thanks!


Projecting much? :)


Again, projecting much? I've been on Reddit for more than a decade, moron. You really think you can teach me about my disposition and/or how I act on social media when all you end up doing is showcasing your stupidity and resort to projection?
Dude, you're such a loser with absolutely zero self-awareness. It's both funny and sad to watch.  


I'm relatively "anonymous" here, because I don't want to be turned into some forex "guru" or "brand" for what I'm doing, unlike a lot of dolts on Youtube and even out here. 
My goal is to share something that works with other people, and in a way that's mutually beneficial for all parties involved. I walk that walk. 
You on the other hand, come on Reddit and make utterly ridiculous assertions. You clearly showed that you have no fucking clue what "decentralized" means, and rather than accept your errors, you just hammered on them even more to the point that you became a subject of ridicule. 
And yeah, I enjoy calling out utter stupidity on Reddit, especially since there's so much of it to call out, thanks DK morons like you. 
BTW, you should probably do some research on what the Dunning-Kruger Effect actually is. Because you clearly have no idea right now. That's my last advice to you. :)
See ya' round DK-Kola boy!

Just cash out now. You obviously don't get it.

Fuck Sharia.

This is a bullshit scare tactic, nothing more, nothing less.

"a cryptocurrency"?

Sure thing, Inspector Obvious!

Kinda sounds like when Kodak decided to make digital cameras. We all know how well that went. :)
@_date: 2019-05-14 14:17:16
Pay no attention to the shitcoin shitshow. Just look at BTC's steadily increasing market dominance. It's all anybody needs to know.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:00:12
I'm not "your dude", dweeb.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:15:16
Nobody cares. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 08:06:01
Beginners shouldn't trade forex, especially with fiat as their base currency. This insanity is why more 95% of forex traders lose money. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 05:04:33
If you have to ask, stick to fiat.
@_date: 2019-05-18 13:51:51
Yeah, you're right. Just avoid it. Stay away.
@_date: 2019-05-12 02:45:51
Sure thing, Detective Doofus!
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:34:41
Yeah, it's all one big conspiracy, DK-kola boy! :) 
@_date: 2018-12-03 02:33:55
Yet, tons of people seem to be doing it. Does that make you sad? :(
@_date: 2018-12-22 11:31:06
Thank you redditor for 3 months. What would we do without your infinite wisdom?

CZ is fucking insane that he thought that was even an option. The fact that he actually said it out loud is only more hysterical. Dude, off your high horse. Geez.
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:49:04
"You don’t think these shitcoins influence bitcoin"
:D More like the other way around.
@_date: 2018-12-23 11:47:47
Oh my, is it scaremongering time already? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:41:17
Dunning-Kruger poster child here. :D
@_date: 2018-12-03 01:56:49
Wrong. Check it out for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:40:25
All sounds pretty great, but $300 for six months is pretty expensive once you actually have to start paying for it. You can do the same with LunaNode for about $8 a month to run a full Bitcoin/LND node, and set up is a total breeze with an easy BTCPay web GUI. It literally takes about 2 minutes to set up, and a couple of days for the node to sync, and you're ready to rock. 
But one thing for sure, it's great to have multiple options now for easy node setups. It's what the marketplace needs to thrive. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:03:59
Are you scared? You sound scared.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:43:00
I like it. I like it a lot. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:17:13
Oh yeah, so influential. Especially when he tried to force Bitcoin Unlimited, BTRASH and S2X down the market's throat. 
He's a force to be reckoned with. 
Ha. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:41:35
You have no idea what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:19:24
I second every fucking single thing that you said. 
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:08:19
Wow, we got us a real live detective here.
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:33:29
You can link up any debit card to Wirex and use it to fund your fiat account, then make an instant exchange. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 14:25:26
Get a REAL wallet, maybe?
@_date: 2018-12-06 10:39:34
"more promising coins"... 
You made me spit out my coffee in laughter at that one. :D
@_date: 2019-05-16 05:54:37
Yeah, it's a false narrative. Not everybody pays that. If you're smart and you know what you're doing, you'll NEVER pay the max fee. 
Sorry if OP's too stupid for Bitcoin, but that's not Bitcoin's fault. :)
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:15:06
All the more reason to do smaller transactions on LN. Quit whining.
@_date: 2018-12-11 12:33:02
Somebody sounds jealous. :D
Yeah, what a conman I am, giving my trading strategy away for free, while getting rewarded by my broker for bringing them new clients, who I'll only benefit from if they profit. 
What a scammer I am indeed. :D
Thanks for doubling down on your Dunning-Kruger! Good work! *golf clap*
@_date: 2019-05-28 08:02:00
Groundbreaking information. Duh.
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:49:04
Working fine for a lot of people, including me. 
Hmmmm.... wonder what we're all doing wrong. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:22:49
No. Stop being such a gullible dolt. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 14:08:47
More shit-talk from a zero-knowledge "intellectual". 
@_date: 2018-12-19 13:42:37
That analogy works too. :)

The world's biggest douchebag takes Bitcoin. 
Woohoo, big news. 
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:19:57
"Cryptocurrencies!" 
:D :D :D :D :D 
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:00:52
They're also getting their asses pounded in the press for all of their egregious privacy abuses, and colluding with some pretty questionable parties to manipulate elections around the world. 
Oh, and they're actually LOSING users in the developed world. 
Fuck Facebook and their shitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 16:23:21
Dude, lay off the Footloose soundtrack. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:23:53
Nah. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 09:23:43


The "threat" of arrest, and actually being arrested and charged with something that will stick due to this hilariousness are two entirely different things. 
 


It's also not as obvious as some people would assume either. There are many ways to conceal and/or distort the trails left by your activities with Bitcoin.
 


Yeah, we'll see about that, won't we? 
I suspect that any attempts (if any) to actually enforce these sanctions and prosecute anyone on the basis of them based only on their bitcoin usage will ultimately get laughed out of court for a variety of reasons. Then, there will be a precedent created to keep other cases like it out of court. 
Again, this is a scare tactic, nothing more, nothing less. It's pretty obvious that the Treasury dept doesn't even have any idea of what they're actually doing with it. 
@_date: 2018-12-22 22:22:37
I want the 20 seconds it took to skim over that drivel back. 
Wow, that was even more idiotic than I thought. 
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:44:25
If you feel like you need to be convinced, tell you what. Don't bother with Bitcoin. 
Sit it out. 
Really. 
None of us will give a shit.
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:45:07
Peter Schiff is completely delusional, to the point where he literally makes the same lame-ass arguments he was making two years ago. It's quite pathetic and lame.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:55:46
Yes, via Wirex. 
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:00:10
Yeah, the BTCPay devs must be making shit up then. :D

It was more about Charlie Shrem than anything else. CBS could have done a LOT better with that airtime.
