Is this a thing? As an European it sounds insane!

Explain the link to Trinity College then if this is the guy.

Lots and lots of programmers *have* worked on Bitcoin and refined the code, so what's your point? 
There's a very distinct difference between coming up with *the actual idea* and being able to program it.

Not exactly, he was just stupid enough to post it along with his address while looking for programmers for Silk Road.

Oh yes sorry, I misunderstood.

Microsoft right now:

Weeks? Shit, did he get himself one of those fancy-pants calculators to help with the math?
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:16:53
A week for my GLD though?

Tell me about it. I'm waiting on GLD transfers from 2 days ago and anything I tried to trade this evening vanished into thin air. Took screen grabs and emailed support, nothing. Tweeted, nothing. I have btc left in my cryptsy account but I'm afraid to touch it...what if it disappears too? :(
@_date: 2013-12-06 02:17:22
Off to make an account then!
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:10:46
Yeah, constructive help would be nice instead of this crap. I'm away for 2 weeks and I don't pay for power, why shouldn't I?

If I put that at the end of the CGMiner shortcut link will it work?
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:22:54
I have, with no reply...

Hah cool thanks! Wasn't aware of those subreddits, will check there!

How long have you using bitcoin? I've just started, am trying to mine altcoins and convert them to BTC (so far I've gotten a grand total of $1.89 worth of btc over the past week!). Is that the best way to go about it? I would be looking to buy some, can someone recommend the best place to do so? Cryptsy?
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:12:15
Oops! I'm new to the sub and was in a rush :(
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:07:01
Thing is, I did my BTC and CAP transactions today. My GLD was on the 28th of Nov, was a small amount left in my wallet. I wasnt too bothered about it, but remembered it today and thought I may as well sell it for whatever it's worth while I'm at it.
Have not done any other transactions since, these have been my last 3, but this is worrying :(
Edit: no response from support either.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:13:55
But if I withdraw and they go *poof* into thin air what then?
