If both the hooker-BTC and the debt-BTC are acceptable and viewed the same, then the 21 million cap is meaningless.

There are more alternatives to capitalism than communism. Both are incredibly centralized. 
You don't get more blocks if you include those, and if you just hold on you will eventually force the fees up. In any case, if we are to always to have faith in the self correcting mechanisms, then we can't even argue with them, and we're bound to fit all their actions into that template.

Interest destroys the supply cap of cryptos, because that interest is not from mining. Since all of the interest can't be cashed out on the blockchain, interest requires off chain IOUs. If this is successful, you've just reintroduced fractional reserve, centralised and trust based banking again, and cryptos suddenly turns into debt based fiat again. The more things change the more they stay the same.

We are here to destroy the banks, and now the banks are spending money on bitcoin. They will be prepared to lose a lot of money to get rid of bitcoin when they perceive it as a threat. Widespread adoption is the only countermeasure.

Normally, debt and interest work to the benefit of the banks and is a cost for normal people (student loans, house mortgages etc). Your savings don't exceed these things, normally. So imagine if these loans were taken in BTC, so that you have to pay interest on a currency that increases in value in the way BTC does.

They do the exact same thing with gold and silver. But since the IOUs aren't redeemed that often they get away with issuing a lot more IOUs than they actually have gold and silver (and in total, there are more of these IOUs than there existing gold and silver). Even if it's 1:1 today, that doesn't mean it will remain 1:1.

Governments will pay their employees and they will demand taxes in their currency. If we assume that BTC will be comparable to gold, which is highly doubtful (BTC won't survive a bad enough war or pandemic), it can grow something like x100.

We need to use the decentralized exchanges. The centralized ones constantly fall to theft by themselves or others, or debt (margin trading when BTC more than doubles in a few months. What were they thinking?!). Exchanges fall, over and over again. Exchanges are the most significant nodes on the network, as we have learned during the BIP-148 story. We have to decentralize.

China doesn't exactly have the cultural connection to liberalism and a general sense of freedom we have in the west.

If someone buys LTC for 1 borrowed BTC, and sells the LTC for 2 BTC, it seems that this extra BTC minus interest came out of nothing, didn't it? So margin trading means that the exchange gets a fractional reserve.
