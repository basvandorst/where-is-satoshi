You have no idea what you are talking about, and you also misspelled Janet Yellen's name wrong every single time.


Where did you ever get this idea? Interest rates for any common American are far above 4%/year, so it's not exactly getting reduced. Also, inflation measures buying power, which means the loan doesn't comparably decrease by 4%, it just means that depending on what you buy, the price of things may cost slightly more.


What? This doesn't even make sense.


Tinfoil hat?


What if I told you that home equity is a form of savings, meaning that owning a home means you are saving money.
Seriously this is the most uneducated rant I've heard in a long time.

The Federal Reserve has had a record dovish policy to reduce inflation.

That'd still be hard to do. Apple is worth over $700b. That'd take a lot of adoption -- $100 from each person on earth.

A real market crash would likely destroy bitcoin too.

You realize when "their" market crashes, the whole world economy is pretty shitty.
Do you remember 2008?
And is it really that easy laughing in the middle of an 18-month bitcoin recession?

Keep in mind that by definition bitcoin isn't an investment, just like Euros aren't an investment. It's a speculative vehicle.
There doesn't tend to be too much discussion on speculative instruments in anyways.

I philosophically agree that AAPL market cap doesn't need to be backed up by the exchange of dollars for market cap (eg. it didn't take $700B to make the market cap), but I'm just unsure of whether or not I believe BTC actually creates its own wealth. 
In saying that the market cap is greater than the amount invested into the asset/equity, you are sort of implying that wealth was created. Technically, BTC shouldn't be creating wealth. I understand that it does when blocks are mined, but any non-mined (previously mined) BTC that are bought and sold contribute to the market cap.
So for instance if the coin was first mined when BTC was at $0.01/each, and now it's at $250/each, $0.01 was wealth created (by the mining), and then $249.99 had to be exchanged for USD to drive the price to the current value. Therefore, the overwhelming majority still was exchanged for USD.
