1. I assume you’ve already tried your most common passwords from 2013.
2. Be calm (remembering things is often more difficult when frustrated) and write down *everything* you can remember about it - *everything* - even if all you can remember is that the 2nd character is a 9 then that’s going to save you a lot of time. Stuff like: Capital letters, numbers, other characters like £ and +, length - if you think it’s ~ 10 characters then try 8 - 12 separately. 
3. Double check all you know. 
4. Either select a dictionary or brute force attack - if you think your password is random things like Yb6ndi&amp;8 then brute force. If it contains any words then it’ll be better to use a dictionary. 
5. Download a big dictionary - Op used a 75Gb one.(it’ll take a while.). 
6. Triple check your data - if you think that the password has a 9 in it and it doesn’t then it’s going to take a lot longer. (if you’re unsure about it then leave it out.). 
7. Run Jacktheripper - go to task manager and set it to high priority and OC your Graphics card(s).
8. Let it run for 2-3 days. If unsuccessful then recheck your data and try again.(changing software and dictionaries will not likely yield better results compared to just checking your data and letting it run. 
I hope that you find the password and will gladly dedicate my computing power to finding it if you want to Pm me further information. Good luck friend :)

Why’d it be that? Why are you posting random stuff - people have been running there computers for days searching for a password with over Billions of guesses. Stop just randomly saying shit and run Btcrecover or JTR.

Well it’s in a wallet - if you still have the mining software on your Pc(maybe in the Trash) then open up the .bat file or .config file and that’ll tell you the wallet address.

It’s recommended that you test recovering your wallet. Add a small amount to a new wallet and then recover it with the private key.

Yes but you couldn’t change wallets though - if you had bitcoins in there and you wanted to change and they had a 100% transfer fee then you’d be trapped.

I was just asking for suggestions - i’m not an economist nor do i have much experience in these matters. So I assumed that the majority of people here have a much better idea than me.

I mean at Segwitx2 the price of the 1mb Bitcoin will crash won’t it? I currently only have Ethereum - should i just exchange that for Bitcoin?
