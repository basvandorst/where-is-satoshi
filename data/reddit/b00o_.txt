If you're going to be trading hundreds of thousands of dollars' worth of cryptocurrency, you probably should be a tad more professional about it.

Adopt me? That's a bit weird don't you think? Do you even know what that means?

How about 1 thread for all of them

And just overall starting a sentence with "really i think" doesn't sound very professional.

I've went in and out 3 times because I didn't have a lot of money. But every time I Came out with significant profit. 1st time I entered at 418usd/BTC and sold at 790. 2nd time was 300-580 and my most recent was 7200 to 15000

Sounds like a plan, 2bad I can't do that

It's getting rather difficult to decipher your Google translate encryption.

Try finding someone who can actually structure a sentence properly, scamming goes a whole lot better if  your grammar looks ok.

I'm still trading at Kraken and you're right. The website is garbage. Security is very good at Kraken though, and if you ask their support they'll help you out.

Any recommendations on exchange to use for trading BTC?

Everyone calling it a bubble even though it's one of the toughest currencies out there. Do you even know how much scrutiny there has been around Bitcoin? If it fails or not, it's not a bubble, it's never been a bubble. A bubble wouldn't last 5seconds. It is too easy to say oh you're making money that must mean you're doing something wrong

Risks do get discussed, and then discarded. With patience, BTC will overcome. You can't break it. Beat it down, it gets up again.
We are believers, your infidel thoughts will not divide us!
Besides I make sure that whatever I have in BTC I won't instantly need back at any point.
