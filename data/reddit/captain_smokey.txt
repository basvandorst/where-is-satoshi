Just look at how many delusional people are posting in this thread and ask yourself, is this really a legitimate market?
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:47:01
Totally agree.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:23:55
What is the physical commodity that backs bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:06:27
The fact that this post is being down voted is even more troubling.  Why would pointing out the ease of confirming bank balances offend anybody other than somebody who wants to suppress this information?
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:52:19
Just ask yourself this question, what is the problem bitcoin is trying to solve?  
It has a slower transaction times, higher transaction fees, insanely higher transaction cost (volatility of the currency), and provides no insurance or consumer protections.  
Why do you think big banks are doing such a poor job that we need a decentralized replacement?

Thank you for your reply!

I don't think you are following.  They had an auditor way before the subpoena was issued.  Its called agreed upon procedures and obtaining a report for the balance of cash would have been an extremely quick and timely thing to issue.

Ether hit $500 last month.  Chill out boyz.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:29:35
I think its asinine to think its hard to track $2B in cash for any legitimate business.  This just isn't a hard thing to prove.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:29:43
Ask tether.  They claim they fired their auditor due to the complexities involved in the audit.  How complicated is it to confirm some bank balances?

How you know you are being conned 101

This is an interesting point, do you mind elaborating further.  I'm not trying to just bash bitcoin, I'm genuinely trying to understand its value.  What does bitcoin provide these people that their local currency does not?  There already seem to be hundreds of applications that allow people in third world countries to transact value between each other, what is bitcoin adding to this equation?

What exactly did he say that was wrong?
I get that the price of bitcoin went up a lot from when this video was made, but his points about how bitcoin doesn't actually solve any current problem are pretty spot on.
@_date: 2018-01-31 05:00:29
You guys are actually surprised that giving private individuals the ability to print money is a bad idea?  My favorite part, many of you used fiat to buy these fake tokens.  LOL!
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:05:21
I'm not sure what the incentive would be for a bank to falsify the balances of their customers, especially in confidence with an auditor.  The whole idea that we can't easily confirm tether's reserves is quite troubling.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:17:27
Why would there be a widespread adoption of bitcoin?  What is so wrong with the current market that we all need bitcoin so bad?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:05:35
Fuck that!  I love panic markets! :)

So what is your net gain/loss in crypto?
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:00:55
Another jewel from an uneducated young person.

Sadly, kids who take out student loans don't even know what debt is.  Its not a lack of college education killing our youth, its student loans.

Thank you!

No way that chick owns crypto.

Hey guys, can you whip our your crystal ball and predict the future for me.  Just trying to get rich kk.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:06:48
LOL!  This guy is losing his ass off right now.
Welcome to crypto.

Hey guys, this guy wants to tell us all what to do with our coins.  
@_date: 2018-02-21 20:36:34
Thanks for your unoriginal opinion.  Please know that I could careless what you think about this subreddit.  Thanks for taking the time to tell us how you think we should behave though!
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:58:28
The truth hurts.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:31:15
Great investment when you claim a single man can bring it down.  This is what happens when you invest in something that has no underlying value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:20:43
You are gambling bro.  There are no guarantees in this market.
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:58:12
I didn't know people were this stupid.

Question re-phrased "Who's going to jail for all of this?"
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:30:02
Do you think bitcoin has changed over the past year?  Exactly.
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:28:14
Sorry if you tried to get rich quick but your assumptions are mostly true.  The price sky rockets because of people just like you.  Sadly for you, most of those newcomers have gotten out.
Fact is, btc is good for operating outside the regular means of banking.  This will always have a market, but its not the next coming of Christ like people here will try to make you believe.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:57:34
You sound like real professional.  lol.
@_date: 2018-02-28 02:03:53
Did he reply to this irony in the AMA?
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:34:08
This is the kind of lengths you bitcoiners will go to in order to justify this worthless commodity.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:09:05
Wall street guys buy stocks, you know those things that provide equity and are based on real value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:14:29
Guys he believes in the technology, thats why he is so concerned with short term gains / losses.

Is it easy to convert that amount of bitcoin to cash?  I keep reading that people have made these fortunes but can't get banks to convert their bitcoins.
