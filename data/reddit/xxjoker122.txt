Disconnectttt looks like you’re out of the crypto game
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:26:28
Hope you got the private keys for the wallet. Not having enough memory finish downloading blockchain could be the least of
Your worries
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:32:53
Yes you’re right, not an audit but a notification. Which usually leads to a full scale audit. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:18:18
And? Is that big? Tesla has sell and but orders for 100 million +
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:53:21
Good one, maybe that’s why you’re so
Broke because your 10. Hahaha pathetic as hell. I got shit load bitcoin kid be jealous .
@_date: 2018-08-23 20:17:35
Yea when you create wallet first thing you always do is obtain private keys. The private keys are how you gain access to the wallet.If you never got private keys then funds are gone for ever.
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:20:12
So it’s more stable then the dollar but it’s volatile?
@_date: 2018-08-19 23:25:18
Not a possibility, any amount over 10000$ deposited into a bank account triggers an audit from the irs
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:08:21
No you’re not getting it,  the discussion of increase in block sizes was banned from this subreddit before Bcash forked. It wasn’t an alt coin at that point. I don’t like Bcash i just want to know why this happened, and if the community even knows this happened and if they care
@_date: 2018-08-10 02:51:46
That’s one of the reasons it’s maker made it.

Did you work for this money? Do you know what it’s like to not be able to pay bills or buy food? Most likely not. You have no idea what the true value of money is because you’re still a kid. I’d recommend you work for a couple more years and know what it’s like to struggle before you invest.

If you don’t use an exchange it’s not traceable, only when you give an exchange all your contact information can you get caught.Buy privately, and it’s impossible to identify someone.The
Blockchain has no personal information within it.

If your trying to only beat inflation you’re better off with mutual funds or blue chips. Average return is 8% per year
Edit- if you want potentially insane gains crypto

Ok that’s fine but why censor them, I don’t like Bcash either but bitcoin is decentralized yet we have a centralization in this sub Reddit that censors people. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:11:26
Yes you’re fucked
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:54:39
I hate bitcoin cash because increasing block sizes is a bandaid on an open wound. The increase in block sizes is a scam itself. It’s good for short term. Remember when a gig of data was a lot 15 years ago? Imagine 15 years from
Now. The real solution is developing software that is consensual. The internet was made in the 70s,yet we’ve developed software on top of it and made the greatest invention of mankind.Bitcoin is the same, the answer isn’t “let’s just make blocks bigger”. The Lighting network  is the first step of fixing this problem. 
  Even with that aside, Bcash has inflation.The inflation rate is a little over  1%,which doesn’t seem like a lot but believe me it is. Even with the major technical faults with Bcash, the overall leadership is horrible.
@_date: 2018-05-06 15:20:54
Yes, so I used {dumpprivkey} after unlocking my encrypted wallet. This is the key I need correct?
@_date: 2018-05-09 02:22:55
Do you need a safe place?
@_date: 2018-08-24 20:06:56
the business practices surrounding bcash is downright illegal, it’s a borderline phishing scam. They are literally convincing the public and un educated that bitcoin.com is the source for
Real bitcoin. False advertising, phishing, and fraud committed by wright.They are forking again because that coin is such a mess.stay away plain and simple.
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:55:23
Then you’re full of shit because it’s impossible. If bitcoin isn’t sent to the correct fucking address it’s gone. Looks like you’re just Seeking attention hope you lost it all.
@_date: 2018-05-05 21:23:31
Do what we have done since the beginning, get private keys, save wallet information on notepad as a .text file. Save text file onto multiple flash drives. Encrypt flash drives if you want, if not just store them somewhere safe. Now you have cold storage without any third party software. As long as flash drives don’t break or get destroyed you will always have funds.
@_date: 2018-05-06 11:33:01
A ledger is literally a flash drive with software on it lol. I’ve had flash drives with information on it for almost 15 years and they’re fine. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:34:45
It was never even proposed that bitcoin cash was going to be an alt coin at that point, it was just a suggestion of block size increase for bitcoin core, so please come up with a different argument than the alt coin one. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:23:40
Ok we we ban people from talking about something because it might become another coin? This had nothing to do with Bcash at the time yet all conversations about the idea of block size increases had been banned? This was months before fork. I’m just trying to find answers, i don’t think this is right.Are we going to ban other people for coming up with ideas on the progression of bitcoin? I’m not saying Bcash is the answer but how are we going to grow as a technology when the biggest community of the technology bans people for giving collective ideas. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:05:13
Yet paper that comes from trees is worth 30x the market cap of gold. All because someone said it’s worth that much. Yet you think the most advanced form of money ever invented in human history has no chance of even getting 3x the market cap of gold? 
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:59:21
Yea expect this censorship happened before Bcash even forked, so it wasn’t even an altcoin at that point, it was just a discussion
@_date: 2018-05-09 23:50:51
Can you please show me links, if that’s the case then I understand

The April’s fool post was posted 17 hours before bitcoin  increased. It was April 2 when the increase happened. Not to mention that most alt coins are up 40% this month. If you think a post on Twitter caused a 19 billion dollar spike 17 hours later, you shouldn’t be investing money

He wasn’t worried about not paying taxes/ and coinbase limit issues,if he was he buy it third party on the dark web. So that leaves you with the question why did he ask you this. Most likely stolen funds or he was washing money.

How can I sound like anything? Never thought you could  hear sounds from words? I stand out in Germany because I’m pro trump?  Maybe you
Don’t have a immigration problem where ever you’re from, but here in Berlin  it’s a big problem that effects a lot of Germans negatively and a lot of Germans like trumps tough stance. Also going off how brexit went I’d say it’s pretty apparent that people in England believe the same way also. But this is what you people do, you think Americans are the only people who think the way they do when in reality a large portion of people through out the world think like that also.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:05:45

Can buy anything on overstock.com with bitcoin? Not to mention you can get a debit card with your bitcoin on it and buy things. Try again. Your just uneducated  and ignorant.

“A lot of money” is subjective.  Is the entire point of your comment a reflection of jealousy? Sorry I don’t consider $300 a lot of money.How is that even remotely bragging. I’m also assuming the average household isn’t investing money. If you’re struggling paying groceries, it’s most definitely not a wise idea investing money. The money I invest in crypto is money I can afford to lose, now if that money I invest  is money that would make your ability to live better, well I’m sorry this is called life.

You just don’t get it, money is subjective. Should I not post that I bought 10$ worth of something because 10$ in parts of Asia is a months salary and it might offend someone ?? Sorry if your offended because you think $300 is a lot of money, for me and a lot of people it’s not.Thats life. Point of my post was to discuss the bull run that I was predicting. Unfortunately your jealousy, and lack of understanding that money is “subjective” clouded your reading ability and your Brain took this post as “bragging”.

Because you live in a police state.Your government can’t control it and doesn’t want the avg joe with 500$ making 5000.The only thing they can do legally is make banks crack down on the trading.A lot similar how the us government made deposits over 9,999$ automatically trigger an audit from the bank and the irs during the 80s.

The whales your thinking about aren’t whales. I’m talking about people with access to almost
A trillion dollars combined.These people start wars, run countries and effect ever person on the planet.This isn’t some fantasy, this exists. And when you’re talking about taking everything these people have away by eliminating their currency,they will stop at nothing to stop us. These people don’t care about the money, they only want power. The only reason they’re getting involved is because we threaten their existence. Once we have a global currency that frees people of their chains they will seize to exist.Im done talking about it and honestly I shouldn’t of even talked about this on here. Go on the dark web, 100000s  of people know this is happening.

Because they don’t care about the price, they are increasing their holdings by getting us out. Once they are comfortable with how much they own then they will pump the price and sell off. You think it’s a joke yet in 2014 one person manipulated bitcoin and increased the price by 47% heck even 2 weeks ago the mt got trustie sold enough and dropped price 12%.
