This is noob question but I really don't know the answer. "Is Bitmain mining unlimited now? So it is dedicating hardware to mine a bitcoin unlimited? And BU is still part of the main chain? 
Or are they mining BU and it is separate from the main chain?

and to be clear run a full node not a miner? Full node not lite or any variation?

We do need to push and push now! Look at the ice starting to break, companies accepting bitcoin, price resilience etc. We just need some more noise!

So the Chinese government  takes control of exchanges. Watches money flow (stops cheating/scamming by exchanges) which is good for the customer.
Good for the Chinese government is they get to watch money flow and can tax appropriately. 
To me this sounds very good for bitcoin. Tacit acceptance of a new currency and store of value and exchange for it's citizens by the Chinese.

I assume to upgrade Bitcoin to be quantum resistant will need a hard fork? Anyway this is going to be a dumb question but as hard forks are bad and everyone has a innovation that would need to be added by a fork can they all just be put in one big hardfork? So 2mb blocksize plus quantum fix plus heated coffee cup holder?

Every time I spend bitcoins I buy the equal amount in bitcoins back within the same day (I also add a smidge.. just for luck).

Loving the twitter feeds of the mr robot cast. 
at one point a twitter user asks bitpay if they are going to accept ecoin and Phillip Price and another character Minister Zhang pipe up. Roger Ver is mentioned by Zhang as being an 'asset' but a bit unstable! lol!
