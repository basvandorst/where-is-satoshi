As technology takes humans' jobs, basic income seems to be [required for survival]( Studies seem to show, basic income improves capability, motivation, and allows people to work on projects that benefit humanity. Projects they otherwise wouldn't have had the time, or resources to work on. What are the downsides?

Right. Unless an already established currency were used, the initial offerings would have to be small. However, early adopters would have an understanding of the potential growth to come.

The reason I didn't include the world is simply for blockchain size. However, you're right, there would be no way to set up a border, unless there were a snail mailed verification code like Adwords. If that were set up, anyone could still copy and paste the code.

Not everyone, but every household. I think savings would go up, and prices may as well. Some things may also become free.

Bitcoin miners would continue to process transactions, and divide the fees. The total may not be enough to split between the miners and new users, but that would be determined closer to the date it would occur.

What if in addition to the amount the miners currently earn, an additional amount was given to the users?

The YouTube advertising delay got me. Fixed it. Thanks.

I suppose, but isn't that true for Bitcoin as well? I would imagine the financial incentive would draw users, which would popularize the currency. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:42:52
A fixed limit should be applied, otherwise you'd be right.

If the mining algorithm generated and automatically distributed the value, no one would be harmed or tricked.
@_date: 2015-12-22 07:36:42
I suppose that's true of any cryptocurrency. However, why would expanding the recipients of the mined coins inflate the currency to nothing?
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:54:55
The equivalent of $100,000 USD would continuously change, but if there *was* a total limit, the value of savings would continue to increase. 
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:06:36
Oh, right. So I guess this idea would have to be worked into the mining algorithm, or created as a separate spin off coin.

Problem is, the general public doesn't know [we are at war]( Most bitcoin coders don't either. If they realized the urgency of the situation, they might come together to make cryptocurrency (bitcoin, or an index fund) usable for the masses asap.
@_date: 2015-12-22 06:57:38
Why is that?

It may be, if the cryptocurrency becomes illegal or over regulated. Elon Musk recently [warned us of War]( His main focus was Mars, but he mentions all technology in this quote:  
"Most of us instinctively assume that technology relentlessly marches forward, but there have been times before now in human history -- after the Egyptians built the pyramids, for instance, or after the multiple advances of the Roman Empire -- when the civilizations that followed could no longer do what had been done before, and perhaps there's a complacency and arrogance in assuming that this won't happen again." - Elon Musk.  
[Here's some **critical** financial history of War.](

Why not? If we lose power, and/or martial law is enacted, do you think a lot of people could get hurt, or even die?

If there is no money, there is no electricity. If there is no electricity, there is no Bitcoin.

The biggest thing, I think, is for power companies to be able to accept it. The average user just needs to know how to buy and sell. If they can't pay for power, their phones die.

During the great depression, people weren't as reliant on technology. You can't tell what's in front of you by looking in the rear view mirror. The time to market Bitcoin is now.

In America, many, many, financial professionals say it will happen this year.

Do you know, or have any ideas as to why that is?
