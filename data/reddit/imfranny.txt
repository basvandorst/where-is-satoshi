Well, so far Coinbase is the only website I've been accepted on, so it's the only way I have to buy BTC. Most other websites require driving license (which I'm still getting) or my passport, which I don't have because I've never needed one to travel. 
But I think I'll just hope that coinbase starts using segwit in early 2018 and once thats done I'll put more money in and then try to transfer to electurm.
Thanks for the help man :)

That doesn't mean a new big price drop isn't gonna happen...

Is there a way to check the value in euros, €, instead of US dollars?

Well, I didn't actually transfer stuff into my wallet. I've still got it on coinbase...

If you bought BTC 1 year ago then you will have made ~23x what you invested. If you bought before that, you made slightly even more...
I don't know how much you profited since you don't say the number of BTC you own but man, congratulations! Have a merry christmas

Sorry, noob here. What does it mean to request 5% BTC exposure?
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:57:55
You are right.
While we cannot 100% speculate the price bitcoin will be tomorrow, what we can know for sure is that the sudden price rise has been due to adoption.
More people buying = Price goes up
However, what we don't know is when somebody will pull out... And thats the problem. Whenever a pretty big % of bitcoin is sold then the price will drop significantly and then god know when it will come back up.
Remember, price drop means people will panic sell. if you think straight and hold then you might wait a few weeks/months, whatever, and pull through. But people who aren't used to investing (or merching, for gaming terms), then they will panic sell and that will make the price drop even more.
Is bitcoin in a bubble? No. Can it still drop a lot tomorrow? Yes...

What about if we can't use either of these?
Gemini doesn't work on Portugal and Coinbase has failed to verify my identity 2 times... I provided my citizen card and it keeps failing to verify.

I don't think I need to send a picture but I just opened Coinbase and it lists the price at 16136€ which is about 18958$ so it's pretty much hit 19k there.

I'm just a casual reader and I'm new to this, I should actually try to absorb everything there is to know about Bitcoins and try to take some benefits out of it :D

The people that don't understand why it dipped to 4500$ right after nearing 5000$ probably don't know anything about simple economics.
it obvious people dumped some bitcoin on sale right after it hit near 5000$ just for safety, that obviously made the price drop... Don't worry, it will go back to 5000$ after a little while.
Same will happen when it hits 10k, 15k, 20k...

What exactly has been happening with BTC?
