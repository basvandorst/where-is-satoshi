Yup, the prices are per listing and 3% of the final sale price. I believe it does affect revenue, but brings unnecessary risk for the buyer. Buying offsite means you lose any and all protection that buying through the site would offer. But like I said, I'm on the security team and not finance or whatever.

Hey! I work at Etsy (in the security department) and we've had many debates on accepting bitcoins as payment. The general consensus is that it would be totally awesome, but I don't think it will be happening any time soon. :(

I'm not too familiar with instawallet. I thought the only copy of the private key was in the URL, and this was used to decrypt the wallet that allowed you to perform transactions. If it is a shared wallet, then yeah, you would have to trust the server to begin with.

Private keys in the URL end up in access logs. Admin suddenly wants all your coins? All he has to do is grep the logs. Among other things, of course.

There was this time in where everyone and their dog started their own service which handled bitcoins. (It's still happening but not to that extent) I spent maybe a few days going through the subreddit finding serious flaws in most of them with little to no effort in these websites. It makes me sad :{


Lolwut, are you talking about BREACH? [GZIP timing exploits]( aren't a thing...

By your definition, [persistent/stored XSS]( is not XSS. You are right, the payload is not loaded from another domain, but the attacker still managed to inject their javascript into a trusted context. That is the definition of XSS, whether reflected or stored, stored in an html file or in the database, etc.

The attacker got their javascript to execute in the context of localbitcoins.com. This is pretty much the definition of XSS. Their fancy payload doesn't change that. :|

If you have to measure in MHashes, you're definitely not going to be able to compete. :}

Not all CAPTCHA implementations would have stopped this. For example, one of the biggest captcha services, ReCaptcha, wouldn't have prevented the requests from being made programmatically.

Because the best way to stop panic is to shut down an exchange... :)

It's been almost half a year since I opened my coinbase account + verified my bank account. I've only sold here though, so I guess that's it?

Why are you the literally hitler of bitcoin exchanges?

Not specific to, but still applicable to recaptcha: You can solve a recaptcha, but not submit it. Now you have a captcha identifier, and a valid answer to go with it. You can hardcode these values into your payload. Because you never actually "used" that captcha, it's still valid. 
You can just do this many times manually, and hardcode all those values into your payload such that they can be used automatically.

Basically, what it looks like q.js does is that it initiates a withdrawal to 1DnwcSevrYyUCTxbPmL1TtABoaucDTMTYo and LSQBL4Rs1rjP3tZUVb4MfXSQu1JEyWr7ix on your behalf.
Unless btc-e already fixed the xss, it doesn't look like that should work any more. I wonder if btc-e is going to make any announcements regarding this shitty bug. At least 60+ bitcoins have already been stolen, and who knows how many litecoins.

I just get these emails whenever I try that. I didn't get quoted on a dollar amount either, it just gave me a checkbox to ask for permission to charge my bank account.
