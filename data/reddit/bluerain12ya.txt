If you want an uncontrolled and unregulated piece of software have access to your hardware, knock yourself out.
The very least the website should ask if I want adverts or help them mining. However, though it wasn’t the case this time, imagine if that page would quietly keep running the miner in the background even after you leave the page. The only way of knowing it is still running is looking for a process that’s using more CPU/GPU power than it should. Tell me how many people know how to look for that.
You and I may know our computers, but what about a grandma or anyone less computer literate? There’s already a major issue around online security, the last thing this community needs is the reputation of stealing processing power from unsuspecting individuals.
So why not take it a step further and create a botnet specialising in mining? Do we really want that?
I wonder what the profit would be from having visitors on a webpage mine for you.
My 1080ti barely mined £0.30 running at full power in 10 minutes. And I don’t have to pay my employees, domain name rental, server maintenance, licenses...
Maybe a website like Facebook or YouTube could potentially benefit from it, having hundreds of millions of visitors every day, run a mining script that doesn’t take up all the processing power, but unless you have that, stealth mining is utterly pointless.
But yeah. I agree with you. Just an opinion

Perhaps you can ask firs?
Give me a choice and I will think about it. Use my pc without asking, however, and we have a problem.
There isn’t a single notice or info about the webpage informing their visitors of that miner.

Then I guess you don’t need anti virus/malware or firewalls either �� I have to admit, I’m super jealous right now.
