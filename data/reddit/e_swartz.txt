The hypothesis is that the drug assists in breaking down barriers that prevent people from fixing their lives. The long-term benefits I think support this

The point is that the logic is flawed and it would be equally absurd to punish doctors, pharmacists, and companies on the same grounds.  Doctors, pharmacists, and companies are dishing out drugs which are deemed *legal* and they have licenses to do so.  Silk Road dealt both legal and illegal drugs, but the vendors obviously did not have licenses to do so nor did they go through the proper procedures in lending the drugs out, obviously.  The issue that arises is the absurdity of the Scheduling of drugs in the United States and the overall hypocrisy of the system.  
So yes, I appreciate the attempt to kill my statements, but I'm really not that stupid.  I believe, under the current laws, that Ross was guilty of crimes and that he knows that himself.  The questions become whether these laws are fair and carry out their purposes properly.  This is in regards only to the drug trafficking charges.  The attempted murder charges are a different story, of which can be equally debated given the evidence of the corruption of the agents investigating the case.

Here is the information you're looking for.  
Keep in mind that 2 out of 50 states do not have money transmitter licenses, and some states [have specifically addressed cryptocurrency](  The short answer is yes, you would need a license, especially if you want to do some type of high volume.

This idea has been brought up multiple times.  I made a long blog post that discusses how the monetary scheme would look like: fees, upvotes, moderation, spam/trolling/shilling control, anonymity, and why a system like this could be beneficial -- especially in the context of more serious discussions where user-created content is extremely valuable.  There are plenty of examples of people trying to do this.

I think the point is not to earn massive amounts of Bitcoin, but rather use the fact that a single satoshi can be used to leverage contracts
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:31:34
this is how I view it but I can be completely wrong..it's like you color a satoshi for a certain use-case.  Let's say I am buying a soda from a vending machine.  The vending machine prompts me with a transaction for 1 can of coke.  Embedded in that transaction is a contract that states that the soda won't be dispensed until it receives $X or X BTC or at least a "promise" for that amount.  I send the machine a satoshi that is "colored" for the value of the soda..i.e. it will allow access to pull that amount of money from my connected bank account or push that amount of BTC over to the machine.  Since the transaction was encoded using satoshis, it is stored and secured by the blockchain, which means that if the money that is pulled from my bank account never shows up to the company owned by the vending machine, then they have a public ledger that they can go back and say, "hey, you agreed to pay this, but you never did."  Apply this scenario to 1000s of use-cases.  
Now how all that would work out I am unsure, but this is my interpretation.  
@_date: 2015-05-18 18:58:01
"A new approach to micropayments. Historically, it has been difficult to get people to dig out their credit cards in order to purchase things online, particularly on mobile devices. The fixed cost of signup alone exceeds the benefit for the vast majority of sites. A continuously replenished stream of digital currency on your device generated by default from a 21 BitShare chip can change all that."
This is the most exciting part for me, but it certainly necessitates addressing blockchain bloat.  Will be interesting to see the input of industry/academics on addressing scalability.  edit: they will likely conduct transactions between devices on a separate sedition maintained by the network of 21's devices.  or off-chain?

so in this [CoPay demo video]( if there are 2 more parties that are required to co-sign the transaction, aren't the funds still technically being sent from the phone that initially scanned the QR?  It's just that the actual merchant here cannot dictate that?

I would like to think the team at 21 realizes the importance of decentralization and will have means in place to not threaten the integrity of the decentralized network.
@_date: 2015-05-14 15:27:18
Okay thanks.  Can you tell me if this scenario would work?  Person A is the merchant but we also want person A to be a co-signer on the transaction.  Person B is the customer who we want to co-sign the transaction but we also want to have fund the transaction.  Person C is the additional co-signer.  Person D is a potential co-signer but really serves more as a designated arbiter in case something went wrong.  
So the merchant (person A) creates a payment address for a product using the Bitpay merchant app for instance.  The merchant then copies the payment address and opens up a new application with multi-sig capabilities, similar to CoPay.  The merchant creates a new multi-signature transaction by selecting person B, person C, and person D and making them co-signers on this specific transaction.  We then can essentially require person B (customer) to be the one funding the transaction because it is known in the scenario that persons A,C, and D will never use funds for the transaction..they are simply co-signers.  Person B would have to fund the new multi-signature wallet from an outside wallet that he/she controls.   
Is this correct/plausible?  $1.00

please.  Prescription overdoses cause [44 deaths per day]( in the United States alone.  If you're going to apply this logic to Ross, then it should be applied to the doctors that order the prescriptions, the pharmacists that hand them out, and the companies that make them.  Ross was clearly guilty of running the Silk Road, but to say this crime is worthy of life in prison is obscene, IMO

@_date: 2015-05-14 16:36:45
yes, this is for a specific use case that is outside the norm.  the reason the merchant is part of the multi-sig transaction is because we want to be able to track the fact that the merchant was tied to this transaction...essentially for this purpose we want to be able to tie the merchant/customer/and person C to the same transaction for purposes of tracking.  Weird scenario, but that's the purpose

The idea of using Bitcoin for micro-tipping on forums has been being thrown around here in the past few days and Xapo's integration on a social media platform also shows that this type of model on the internet may be ubiquitous one day.   I had already been in the process of trying to write up a post from the perspective of how such a forum model could improve how scientists communicate their results not only with each other but also to the general public.  This write-up is pretty long, but I attempt to show how science desperately needs to catch up to the age of the internet in order to solve various problems.  I'd love to hear any feedback you have, if I missed anything, or what I could improve.

Thanks for the comment.  This is actually something I meant to directly address, so thank you for the reminder.  Here is my brief rebuttal:


there is no evidence to base this off of.  it would be the first experiment.


This is exactly the problem.  How many of these prestigious publications are actually replicable?  We cannot risk to lose the integrity of the scientific process by gaming the system.  
I imagine that the community would not be bootstrapped by scientists - at least the ones we refer to as the PI.  Instead, it would be bootstrapped by graduate students, post doctoral researchers, technicians, medical students, etc, who are knowledgeable but also eager to spread information that they know and learn more.  The guys over at already make posts without an incentive, but I argue that an increasing amount of these types of people would go to make posts if there was a monetary incentive (even if small) to do so.  
The real scientists we refer to as PI's would come into the discussion later.  If you know anything about scientists, you know that they love to talk about their work.  You also know that they will defend their work to no end if it is challenged.  I think they would join in on discussions if the people are there to discuss with.  


This is an interesting point and was just an idea.  I don't think it is necessary to directly monetize the review process.  It's important to keep in mind this wouldn't just be an outlet for reviews of papers, but also a community to offer technical advice and general information as well.

it's more of a perspective statement.  yes, doctors can be charged in cases of over prescribing and overdose, but the frequency and thoroughness of prosecution in those events are likely to be much less than if the drug is Schedule 1 and non-prescribed.  The statement is more a poke at the hypocrisy of our country's drug laws in general.

Yeah I came across this while doing some research on what's out there already.  It is a cool idea that definitely has its use cases.  For the one I propose, though, I argue that anonymity is not desirable for serious discussions and that we lose a lot of efficiency when decentralizing completely.
