Stack sats and spend when appropriate. I imagine as adoption increases, the stacked sats will be worth a lot in a bitcoin backed economy and more opportunities to spend them will come. Hopefully the tax code will favor bitcoin spending by removing capital gains tax on bitcoin in US  and other countries.

When was the last time you failed to complete a transaction because a miner refused to include it in their block? Maybe if your fee was too low, it would fail, but that just means you got outbid by people paying higher fees not because a miner didn't want to include your transaction. They will take the highest fees so they can run and maintain their mining equipment. Block space is limited. Maybe the miner refuses to include transactions below a certain fee, but that doesn't mean you can't get your transaction included in a block by a different miner. If you run your own node, then you can validate the miner's block when it's complete. I don't see how you need permission from miners to transact. I think it is very different from other currencies. In the US, AML requires reporting of transactions over $10k, if the bank or a three letter government agency doesn't like your transaction they will hold your money or they can seize it through civil forfeiture. That can't happen in bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-15 12:24:37
What they mean is you don't need permission from anyone to run your node on your computer to validate/verify those transactions. You don't need permission from anyone to transact with whoever you please.

@_date: 2018-10-26 12:28:55
If you're in the us, every transaction is taxed as capital gain/loss. Which I think is pretty stupid, since we're already taxed on the income we use to buy it. Better to just hold it and use fiat for your transactions. Hopefully in the future, it's taxed differently.

Just because the exchange has a legal obligation to keep your funds safe and will not steal your coins, doesn't mean that when an exchange gets hacked a thief will follow the law or have morals to not hack it in the first place and not steal the coins in your exchange account.
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:17:13
When you keep your Bticoin on a web wallet, the owner of the server hosting the web wallet has control of your private keys. If that server gets hacked your private keys can be exposed and you can lose your bitcoin. This is analogous to keeping gold at the bank instead of in a safe in your house. If the bank gets robbed, you are SOL. You also don't necessarily need a hardware wallet, it is just a very practical way to keep your private keys secure. You can also choose to use a software wallet. A software wallet stores your private keys on your hard drive. This puts the burden of security on you instead of the web wallet providers. The convenience of a hardware wallet comes in by storing your private keys on a secure chip on the device. The keys are never transmitted to the computer you connect the hardware wallet to, only the transaction signatures. Does this help? Or what part are you confused about?
@_date: 2018-06-26 16:03:32
What you have on the exchange is a number in a database that's an IOU for the actual coin.
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:27:49
If your hardware wallet gets lost, all you need to do is restore the wallet using the seed words on another wallet and transfer your balance to a new wallet. If someone finds your hardware wallet, they would only be able to open it and spend the balance if they guess your pin. So it really doesn't matter if you lose your device, the most important thing to protect are your seed words, with those, anyone can spend your coin, whether they know your wallet pin or not. Also, [here]( are a bunch of resources for more answers to your questions. If you have a technical background I would also recommend reading Mastering Bitcoin, it really helped me understand a lot of how it works. Even with a CS degree, some of these topics can be very complex. One goal with Bitcoin I would say though, is to get past all these difficulty barriers and make it super simple to use for anyone. The majority of people don't know the complex inner workings of the internet for example, but everyone still relies on it.

@_date: 2018-06-21 12:58:03
A hardware wallet does not work like that. A hardware wallet cannot lose your Bitcoin. Your Bitcoin are stored on the block chain, the hardware wallet just contains the signatures to unlock them. If the hardware wallet fails, the seed words can bring it back instantly on a spare wallet. Take your coins of the web wallet ASAP. Not your keys, not yours coin. Like the other person said, do not regret leaving them there.
@_date: 2018-06-26 12:48:16
Not your keys, not your coin. Don't keep coins on exchanges.

Right, I gets that they have to register. But if private transactions become a thing, they could do sales off the books. How does sales tax on unreported private transactions get enforced?
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:17:20
Ok, I was thinking remittances were just sending money to another country like through western union for example, and how bitcoin eliminates the need for services like western union.

Very interesting, I have so many questions now. Almost everything else you use daily is plugged in, isn't it?
Your fridge, microwave, laptop/PC, TV, lamps, washer, maybe your dryer and stove, what makes the car any different?
Does seeing your other appliances plugged in also give you anxiety?
Can you not just plug a car in, then leave so you don't have to see it? Maybe hide the cord or park it in a way that the cord isn't visible? Would that reduce your anxiety?
Would you say your anxiety to seeing the car plugged in is rational? Or just a random irrational feeling you can't explain?
Does seeing your gas car connected to the pump with a gas hose give you anxiety too?

Demand outgrew supply
@_date: 2019-02-18 02:33:27
Don't undershoot it. Buy at current price. That's the whole point of dca. You average in all your buy ins, so your individual buy ins price doesn't matter. This way you still accumulate your bitcoin and not miss your buy in day by undershooting. You just end up with less bitcoin your way.
@_date: 2019-02-18 14:09:10

1. Cryptography nerds collect Bitcoin because it is interesting. Bitcoin has no value.
2. Bitcoin is assigned a value, 10,000 Bitcoin = two large Papa John's Pizzas = $30
3. Merchants see the store of value proposition and decide to accept Bitcoin, but price their items in fiat currency. 
4. Merchants start pricing in Bitcoin since their suppliers also accept Bitcoin.
Or something like that.

The value is derived from what people think its value is. Same as gold or fiat currency. The way something becomes a currency is through 4 sequential steps.
1. Be a collectible. Humans like to collect things. Sea shells are an example. People collect them because they find it interesting.
2. Be a store of value. Sea shells take time to collect and they can only be collected by the coasts. People would use this to store their time collecting the shells as value.
3. Be a medium of exchange. Once the sea shells store value, people use it to trade their value for other goods or services. Because they store value, other people will accept them for their goods and services.
4. Be a unit of account. People start pricing items in terms of sea shells. A load of bread is 5 shells, a haircut costs 5 shells. Maybe you have a loaf of bread and need a haircut, but your barber doesn't need a loaf of bread, by being a unit of account, you can exchange that value.

Difficulty goes up and down according to hashrate, not transaction fees. Higher transaction fees encourages more miners to mine Bitcoin, which in turn increases the hashrate. The increased hashrate pumps out blocks faster, so the difficulty goes up to slow down the blocks to average 10 mins per block.
