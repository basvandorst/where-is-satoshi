Part of it being so cheap is he’s probably moving full coins instead of a bunch of pieces fees for normal people moving normal money are still higher

Split buy half now wait and do the other half when it jumps or when it drops ... law of averages you still win

So the bitcoin itself is going to constantly deflate over time as we use it and adopt it more?
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:44:53
Ok so that explains the split of bitcoi... and No I’m saying at full adoption... if there was only bitcoin and no fiat currency... the only option bitcoin would have to to have more buying power/bit and at what point are we getting ridiculous like is a life savings going to be 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin.... why even account for the schedual of mining in this I’m think long term 100 years after all of the bitcoin is mined 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:35:52
How does it adjust for inflation and at what point is it split into too miniscule of amount s I answered neither of these questions?

Blockchain is the future, and bitcoin is the “Apple” of blockchain

To everyone... every If my parent had bought me gold for my future I wouldn’t have known it’s a chance, yeah but the proper research and knowledge that it’s a caring action it’s 600$ what’s the difference between 600$ now or 700$ in ten years after a bond or savings rather then risking it on he 1;3 that it goes as we call “moon “
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:31:12
I mean it is deflating right now wether new ones are being mined or not because adoption is growing faster than the amount being mined is and anyone who understands economics understand that it’s price is only bound to increase 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:36:33
I mean this is a fairly complex question  and since no one can give an answer I’m gonna swine that you’re not smart enough to and the education system failed you?
