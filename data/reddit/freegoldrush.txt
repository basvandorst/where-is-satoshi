It's just that stocks are FAR easier to create than bitcoin.  A company can make new shares and sell them.  They often do.  Comparing bitcoin to a stock is misguided.

The mempool problem hit a tipping point and went mainstream this month.  The Wall Street Journal showed those who know nothing about Bitcoin how to buy a $12 pizza for $70.
First impressions are hard to change.

Although Coinbase could have come out way ahead by consolidating while fees were much lower, I cannot see that they have a long term solution regardless of what they do.  Cleaning up small UTXOS as they move along in time will not work for them.

So now the freedom provided by crypto currencies has devolved into organized boycotts?  Are labor unions next?  How about a crypto tax that is supposed to be spent in the best interest of all crypto owners?

Me.  This is priceless.
Last time it was at $13k people thought it couldn't go higher.  Now they now it can because it has.

The fake gold coins are ironic.

I just did a BCH transfer that showed in my wallet within seconds and confirmations cost less than 4 pennies.  What's clunky??

I have not complained once about open source volunteers or my personal problems.  WTF are you talking about?

Did no one actually read the study?
I own Bitcoin.  But let's get real.
Even Diane Reynolds says it is unrealistic.  She estimates 200 million channels.  Opening a channel requires a blockchain transaction.  With Bitcoin able to support 2.3 trans/sec on average, that means it takes more than 1,000 days just to open the channels, much less leave room to close any.  It would also lock 4 million bitcoins into LN.  Only about 6 million bitcoins are actively being traded today.  The other roughly 10 million are 1) dormant, lost, trapped in small UTXOs, or 2) Held in strong hands.
Here are her words:
"All nodes would be reachable with (many) paths of at most 24 hops, and 12 hops on average. However, there would be about 200 million channels. If both users funded each channel with 0.01 bitcoins, then 4 million bitcoins would be locked up in LN payment channels. While this is technically possible, it seems too unrealistic."
She later adds:
"For more realistic scenarios, the number of users should probably be restricted to a million at most."
Ummmm...  We need LN to handle WAY more than 1 million users.

Well said.  Mass adoption won't happen in BTC when BCH, LTC, and others give the average guy more utility.  Simple as that.  I love discussing the gory technical details but 99 people out of 100 don't.  They just want it to work.

You trust the bank?  But I thought that's why we owned crypto.  lol.

The link to her paper is at the top.  Just read her own words.

That is a good example of where you can combine things.  The maximum theoretical efficiency gain is 25%.  The actual gain depends on how many UTXOs are present in each transaction.
That can increase through from 3.2 tx/sec to 4 tx/sec.  The requirement is for thousands per second.  I don't buy the argument that "we are getting closer" or "this is a good first step."  Core isn't making that argument either.  The risk you run is that people will then say, "ok, if that's a good first step then you must love BCH or LTC, because they can achieve far more already."
It's a very basic logic problem.  If you want Bitcoin to be something different then it is no longer Bitcoin.  If you want to preserve the current blockchain in your new implementation, then that is a called a fork.  There is no getting around this.
The LN concept will work with any crypto.  The idea is that you have a multi-sig wallet shared by two parties, then you trade the wallet value instead of the actual crypto.  ok, fine.  I'm not knocking the concept.  It certainly has some use cases.  But it is nonsense to think about this as "making bitcoin faster" or "speeding up transactions".  Bitcoin will still work the same with LN.  The LN advantage is that you can take some activity that would otherwise have been done with a Bitcoin trade and do it with an entirely different kind of agreement that is backed by Bitcoin ownership.
It is my opinion that the use cases are small.  Some people think the very vast majority of use cases can be tackled this way.  It is my opinion that people will overwhelming want to store their bitcoins in wallets where they are the only ones that can sign transactions.

How can you combine it with other scaling solutions when LN requires that bitcoins are committed to channels before they are spent?
Listen, I'm a bitcoin holder and an engineer.  I'm just pointing out the obvious.  Asking me to build a better solution is a rather childish, knee-jerk reaction.  We should be able to discuss engineering details without so much emotion.

Can you provide a technical definition for "clunky"?  It works exactly the way bitcoin was intended to work.  BCH is fantastic.

terabyte+ nodes are not that big of a deal.  This is easily done with a Dell machine and a cable or fiber Internet connection.  
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:24:53
Correct.  I remember that well.
