Did you use the road to asia or is your dealer and/or pharmacist very up to date with cryptocurrency? Also, rating of your purchase?
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:46:36

Huh, that's a lot like me getting rapped up in soda making. Maybe I'll just sit back and watch where this all goes.
@_date: 2015-09-27 18:15:44
Not really sure, I guess I'm more intrigued than knowing what I'll do with it. Which is why I'm asking what does it do, and what does it mean that it's causing such a stir.

It talks about the transactions of bitcoins, buying, selling and making it easier. Can you please elaborate on this and "the internet of things?"

Videogames is a good start. I've used the increase in price to my advantage to "technically" buy a 20$ game for 5$. I put 5$ worth into Bitcoin and it increased, giving me a nice discount. So yeah, Steam accepts Bitcoin, G2A accepts it, and maybe others. So yeah, that's a fun thing for me to use it for.
To "HODling"...to be honest I've known bitcoin sense 2011-2012. I've invested a bit. I did the mining thing, I've used coinbase now primarily. The best thing I can say is this. Buy it now, use it for whatever. Keep a decent amount in a type of "bitcoin savings" account and enjoy the ride of knowing you're using an internet created currency that will one day be accepted everywhere, is worth more than almost every currency in our time (more so than gold) and will be a part of history.
Invest your money, don't go crazy with it, have fun with it. And if you see someone like a youtuber, artist, twitch streamer or someone like that accepting bitcoin or any crypto-currency. Then kindly use it and get the circulation going. 
Oh and Gyft, the gift card website accepts it so you can use that to exchange your bits for gift cards. Check your area and help small business by using bitcoin as well. Never know what you might be able to buy with it.
