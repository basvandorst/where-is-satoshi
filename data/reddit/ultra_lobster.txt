Long time BTC owner. I’m still trying to figure out how I get my wallet (offline ideally) for bitcoin cash and bitcoin gold? Right now I’ve got an offline wallet with my original small btc amount in it still.

Am I the only one who listened to everyone on reddit in the BTC noob threads who say, "store your BTC offline, never online and NEVER on a pool or exchange".....
It's killing me seeing how much people have lost but as soon as they stopped allowing USD withdrawals red flags/sirens/everything should have been going off in your head :( 
I never even used Gox so it could have been before then that the flags were going off. But it's a good thing it's gone. Write it in history, time to move on.

I do the math on the bill to make it a round number and tip 0-30% based on the service I was given.
If I can't do the math I'll take a cab home :P

What about getting USD out? I'm getting ready to cash out my coins and enjoy my free video card. Does the 6% paypal option work as easy as intended?

Exactly what his point was. Then if 2nd 3rd largest players hop on board they would stabilize the price further.
