My computing experience in a nutshell
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:08:39
Better than a $20 tx fee for Bitcoin, just saying
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:31:17
Me too
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:12:51
I've been getting this error for a month.  Does it matter that I'm 18 years old and they need to see tax info or something?

Gdax can't verify my identity

I've filled out W9 forms for freelance jobs so idk if that is enough

Will you eat a body part if it goes up 1000 fold?

People keep posting these but nobody is going to buy anything with btc right now until we adopt segwit.
I'm sad because I want to move my coin from coinbase but I'll have to pay $40 even to a segwit wallet.  I cry.

Why does everyone think they can predict exactly what will happen? If I knew what was going to happen I wouldn't tell anyone and I'd be a billionaire.

Tripled my money, now I have a dollar
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:36:09
Idk, my 100 Doge is worth like a quarter though
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:41:10

@_date: 2017-11-30 20:50:52
I need to figure out how to send the tip to a wallet.
Also, watch the price be $100 in 20 years and we're rich
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:29:19
Thanks lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:44:50
Someone tipped me 100 dogecoin on here earlier, pretty nice.

r/bitcoinmining is a better place to ask.  This sub is basically a meme page.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:32:50
For real though, I am new to this and don't totally understand what all this means for my btcs
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:21:42
I want to see this on r/all, people will be confused
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:18:46
And I'm getting down voted by the shills
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:20:34
Think silver certificates backed 1:1 by silver owned by the Fed, but with BTC instead of silver.  It's like Tether, but it's paper representing crypto not crypto representing paper
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:02:05
It's very illegal in my state though
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:42:08
I charge people a variable amount of USD based on it's value against BTC
@_date: 2018-02-10 04:01:53
No, I measure fiat off BTC, and besides, I use paper certificates of BTC not stupid USD paper backed by nothing
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:45:01
I did a tx at 2 sat/byte confirmed in 1 block a few days ago, idk why they still say this
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:08:46
It was fun, thanks
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:01:14
Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:50:44
Nice, I wish we had that here
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:42:58
