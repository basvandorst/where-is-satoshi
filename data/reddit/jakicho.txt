fair enough, you are 100% right, he is 100% wrong.

if we can get 1M person to buy just 1btc like you... Things will start to get crazy
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:50:41


Yes you're right, and as I said I appreciate that from him.


I do understand that the tone changes if one gets attacks on the personal level. I simply suggest to restore an adult discussion without fingerpointing and accusations rather than maintaining the schism within the community. If we end up with 2 bitcoins, nobody will be happy with that.
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:04:16


Sure about that? it sounds like bad faith for me. 


That is the core of the problem to me. You caricatures and reduce a stance to the extrem, put it in your bad idea box without wanting to discuss at least to be pedagogic toward those who want bigger blocks. Discussion is key.
If he really wants to destroy Bitcoin, there is other simplier way for him to do that: Promote other coin and criticize Bitcoin like Vitalik or the Dash team.

Greg, sincerely, I think you oversimplify his stance and make causal relationship a bit quickly.
Roger invests recently in alt because the bitcoin protocole doesn't evolve as 'he' would expect. You cannot blame someone to not fully allocate their wealth in Bitcoin, and use this as an argument against them.
Hedging in altcoins is one think. Hoping Bitcoin crash to see alts explode is another.
Should everyone of us allocate 100% of our money solely in Bitcoin to have the right to share an opinion and contribute somehow to this open-source project? I hope you'll find this prerequisite as extrem as i do.
Moreover whether we agree or not with what he proposes, whether we like him or not, nobody can argue that he has contributed a lot to Bitcoin whether by evangelizing (communication is an important skills) whether by investing in key companies of the Bitcoin ecosystem. So supposing that he wants to undermine Bitcoin doesn't make sense.
Now what I see is that he is an entrepreneur, and entrepreneur are "reckless" risk-taker. And sometime they act quickly rather than simply "sit &amp; think". They don't see the underlying impact. (You know... the cliche of a client who want a red button rather than a blue one, but in reality it changes a lot in the code...) And this is what I feel by reading his quote. So I don't see why you cannot simply exposing bullet point saying "hold on dude, here is why it doesn't work" and carry on in an appropriate manner.
In the quote of Roger, I also understand that for him 'speed of adoption' is critical if we want to give little but no chance to the regulator to undermine the adoption of Bitcoin. And don't you think that he got a point here?
I want to share you this quote from Andreas Antonopoulos:


I guess you won't fingerpointing at Andreas who brings a lot to the community for stating this.


This invention is resilient by nature. If Bitcoin fails, do you really believe that bitcoiner (even hardcore maximalist) will go back to fiat? No way. They will stay in the crypto-currency space. And this is enough to bootstrap a new launchpad for the public.
as an aside,
I read nasty stuff about you on r/btc and nasty stuff about roger here.  Whether it is comments or posts that are upvoted to the main page. I find this childish. I don't come on reddit often. But when I do, this is what I see and feel from the community. This simply pollute the debate and make each side more incline to hold their position rather than genuinely listen to the other side. Don't you think that for the sake of the community we should get read off this 'redditstyle' behavior?

I appreciate you took the time to anwser me. Thx.
Althought you don't address my last point concerning community behaviors. But see, maybe because I'm not align with what appears to be the Doxa, or maybe because I ask question to understand each view, I receive downvotes :D. That is ridicule. 
If I create another account and trashtalk on Roger here, I bet I'll receive tons of upvotes...
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:30:12
My question was simple:


as an important figure in the community, you can have an impact on the behavior of others, (specially those who support you) and depending on how you react and anwser to roger relentless lobbying. You can one way or another calm down the animosity or foster it.
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:52:09


Did he announced that right away or after seing that discussion was not possible? I won't say either that I appreciate the stubbornness of Roger Ver. In fact, i think it is quite over the top and he is shooting in his own foot by doing so. But I can understand that when too much ego gets involved, people act in a silly/cynical way and are less incline to admit they are wrong.


Yeah and that is good thing. But as you see, there are nothing about technics here, only about human working together on an opensource project and bad human coordination arm Bitcoin one way or another. I'm sure with a bit of effort to listen from each side, a better dialog and a mutual understanding it would be possible to convince Roger to promote the adoption of SegWit for example. Here we are in a decay strategy and he is lobbying for his solution. That is sad. If he doesn't succeed, troll will be happy to shit on him. If he succeed with an alternative we will regret to not having find a way to prevent that from happening.


The wording says a lot. Why fight? Warning people to not mess with the code is one thing, being in the defensive toward newscomers that want to contribute is not a positive attitude.

who exactly? Do you have some link to share?
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:38:32
lol. Maybe, he hopes that the next french president (election in may 2017) will give in asylum or even the french nationality (some candidate speak in that sens)

0.001 BTC = 1mBTC = 1 millibitcoin
0.000001 BTC = 1μBTC = 1 microbitcoin = "1 bit"

**I would say it has always been about ego (from both side)**. This shows the inability of the community to handle a debate without nasty ad hominem attacks. Segwit + Lightning Nework is a smarter solution than enlarging the block. Nevertheless, removing opposite opinion wasn't a smart move.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:06:57
It is better when you counter-argument and criticize Roger stances based on the technical aspects solely. Here, there is no argumentation, just ad hominem attacks on the individual and mean suppositions on his backthoughts.
99% of his assets is in Btc according to this interview:
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:22:46
Indeed human are more irrational than computer. Therefore to deal with them it's good to develop kindness &amp; empathy. Being smart is not enough.
The other side also care about Bitcoin, they simply don't have the same vision, or 'ideology'. That doesn't mean they are unethical per se. Fact is neither you or them can guarantee 100% that one way or another will succeed. it is still a giant experiment.
If you really care about Bitcoin you would avoid an attitude that encourages a schism in the community.
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:57:56
You got a point here. But do you really believe that:


This trial of intent doesn't make sense. As I said above: Hedging in altcoins is one think, hoping Bitcoin to crash to see alts explode is another.
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:35:10
Fair enough. I think the same way about him too
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:00:59


Agreed. But once again, bad attitude was on both side. Now stipulating that moderation rules on Reddit controls the price, that is bold. correlation != causation.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:34:23


it's up to you to explain how stupid this idea is and why the risk of scaling quickly is not worth taking. Rather you prefer to jump in the personal level. That is everything but diplomatic &amp; socially smart.
Somebody who looks at the debates from the outside, just want facts and arguments not personal attacks and fingerpointing from each side. Plus you have all the technical legitimacy to defend segwit over raising the blocksize while he doesn't. But you choose to debate in a mean way. That is a shame.

**What can you say about the CoinLab/Peter Vessenes case so far?**

What about you take the remaining billion then contact each person one by one to refund them, can it be the quickest way?
