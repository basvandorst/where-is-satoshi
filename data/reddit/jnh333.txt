Thanks for the feedback! The coins are collectible Bitcoins (steel reinforced, silver plated), because we wanted to make the memento something people would value. So the profits would be small, but we hope to get enough orders to be able to reduce the price to ~$10-15

Done! It's not the cleanest code yet, but it's open-source

It just maps the coins/amounts to a username. No IP address tracking. I made it in a way that stores as little info as possible

Good call. Exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini have ~98% of funds stored in air locked cold storage, and are also insured. So those types of exchanges may be the best option for those who don’t yet have a local wallet

Great point! Please use different credentials, and also try to use a username that can't be tied back to you (as noted on the website)

Great idea! Will do!

Great point! Just added it

Sweet, glad you like it!

Oooh good point. There isn't a way yet, but I can add one.
**Edit:** Added!

Hey r/Bitcoin!
These past few days have been slightly stressful and I found myself constantly checking the prices in coinmarketcap (scrolling down or opening a million tabs) to figure out the prices and keep updated with my losses (and, rarely, the gains...)
I got fed up of constantly all the tabs, scrolling and calculations, so I tried find a cryptocurrency dashboard tool. But I couldn't find anything so I ended up just creating one.
Keep in mind, I made it for myself pretty hastily, so it's not like a totally built out product or anything, but figured I'd share it in case others find it helpful. It's definitely saved a lot of time and stress for me in these past 48hrs, and it'll make it much easier for me to keep posted things during the holidays.
I also made it so you just signup with a username and password (nothing personally identifiable).
As I said, it was quickly put together for my own use case, but I'm totally open to feedback if you think there's any way it could be improved!
Happy HODLdays!

Edit: It just pings the Coinmarketcap API, figured that was the best source for prices

Great point! Just added different currencies

So you're saying that keeping funds on Coinbase is ok as long as you set up MFA and keep the funds out of GDAX?
