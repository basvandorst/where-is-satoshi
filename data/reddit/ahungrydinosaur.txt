Anyone can see the convenience of shopping online vs. having to travel to a shop.
Assuming you don't already own Bitcoin, what is the convenience of buying Bitcoin to buy something (let's say a Dell computer or Xbox points) that you could have already bought in dollars?

Okay, so I can buy Bitcoin from Circle with $100 USD and get $100 USD worth of Bitcoin in a Circle wallet, cool. Do I need to transfer BTC from Circle to Coinbase before I can buy stuff in Bitcoin using Coinbase, and does that transfer have a cost? And does Coinbase take a cut when I buy things with Bitcoin using their service?

And how old were you in 1995? Were you even able to form a perspective on the emergence of the internet at the time?

Convenience: Typing info out can be annoying, but modern browsers and websites are becoming very good of remembering your information and saving you from that hassle.
The security benefit is debatable. Your point that you divulge personal information in fewer places is valid, although you have to entrust that information  to an exchange in order to buy into Bitcoin, and those exchanges have dubious security records thus far. You also assume all risks associated with keeping your Bitcoin secure, either in entrusting your coins to the security of a third party, or taking responsibility to research how to secure your coins yourself. Should your Bitcoins be stolen or lost, you have fewer options for recourse than if your bank account or credit card is compromised. 
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt on this, though. Let's assume someone else sees "less typing + less sending personal info" as a benefit despite what I said above. So they've decided rather than spend $100 on Xbox points, they'd like to buy $100 of Bitcoin and spend that on Xbox points. So they go to an exchange with their $100 to spend on Bitcoin. Help me out here, because I've never actually done this, but isn't the exchange going to take a cut on the way in, and possibly on the way out? If I do this:
$100 USD &gt; Bitcoin &gt; Buy Xbox Points from MS via Coinbase &gt; Get ??? Xbox Points
... what is the dollar value of the Xbox points I actually receive?

So today I buy $100 worth of bitcoin. Let's say I hold it for a year. Then I want to exchange it back for $100 worth of USD. Oh wait, that $100 is worth less next year than it is today, due to inflation of the dollar, regardless of what I stored my wealth in (bitcoins, Legos, marbles, pogs, Beanie Babies...). In other words I haven't defeated inflation at all.
I know what you'll say: in that year's time, the Bitcoins will be worth more than the $100 you bought them for! But that's a gamble; you have no way of knowing that.
And either way, regardless of what I'm storing my wealth in, as long as I'm ultimately turning it back into dollars and paying taxes, the government doesn't care what I do with it meanwhile.

As long as you are still paying taxes, do you really think your government cares what you own? You could buy Bitcoins or Legos or marbles, none of those will make a difference to the government at all.

Do you not see the benefits of automated testing in software development in general, or do you see them but just believe they aren't warranted in the specific case of bitcoin?
If you were writing shopping cart software using credit cards instead of bitcoin, would you use a test network then?

You're forgetting the other side of the price equation: demand. A limited supply of something does not mean it's going to be a good store of value. People have to actually want it for the price to go up.
