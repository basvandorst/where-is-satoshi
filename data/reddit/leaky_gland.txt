Channel factories seem to be interesting. Still can't quite get my head around how you can open a channel without broadcasting a transaction to the blockchain?

So a pseudo-coin is used or the channel cost is shared?

Ok. Check the genesis block bro
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:00:40
Oh, I see, the code does the work for you? Are you notified when a new channel requires opening?
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:58:39
To pay someone that hasn't opened a LN channel ever
@_date: 2018-01-11 12:56:36
So it's not worth opening a channel until more people have done so?
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:15:26
So it's not alpha and is therefore probably secure
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:04:50
People buy bitcoin because they expect the price to go up, yes. What happens when the price goes up is people liquidate, divest and spend.
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:02:11
So you open a channel maybe a maximum of 7 times in a lifetime?

No, you can't control the fees on those exchanges, a good wallet example would be electrum

Bitfinex handles far greater volume
Edit: Grammar
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:46:07
Possibly, right now transaction fees are extortionate. It could be that electrum take an average of recent fees of transactions submitted to the mempool and aggregate a transaction fee from that. I'd say wait a while to move the coin or import your private key to a wallet that allows for more flexibility in adjusting the fees.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:39:32
Looking forward to that climb to 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:42:09
You're correct on the first account, but it's not BTC. To control your bitcoin you need to control your private key and you don't with those exchanges. If you have a good wallet you can control your fees and export your private key to be stored offline.

Core is made up of over 100 developers, most of who have been working from the start of the project. They use a tool called git (developed by the linux kernel coder, Linus Torvalds) which affords decentralised open source software development. No *one* controls Bitcoin.
Segwit is both an on-chain and off-chain scaling solution.
Transaction fees are still negligible so any increases in fees will also probably be negligible.
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:36:32
This has nothing to do with economics. Bitcoin was designed to be decentralised. Any move away from that defeats the object of the project.
Any developer I'm sure knows that you don't need economic knowledge to ascertain whether some*one* has control over a system vs *no* one
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:27:08
I'm sure it's like the Linux kernel. Submit enough reviewed code and you get added as a Dev. It doesn't work that you have an idea and it's accepted immediately. Trust has to be built.
@_date: 2017-02-26 19:27:32
I've actually no idea. That results in $0.80
@_date: 2017-02-24 16:03:03

I guess that needs to be here:
  to start with
What about the structure of the network? The intricacies of how it functions?
IMO the wiki seems a little limited/lacking in information, especially for newcomers. I also know that a sub of 200k+ can do better.
It may help when getting repeat questions to just forward people to straightforward answers.
@_date: 2017-02-14 22:07:19
Until then there will be no change?
Why did we get solutions to problems before but not now?
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:45:43
Maybe this:
A transaction typically references previous transaction outputs as new transaction inputs and dedicates all input Bitcoin values to new outputs. Transactions are not encrypted, so it is possible to browse and view every transaction ever collected into a block.
Standard transaction outputs nominate addresses, and the redemption of any future inputs requires a relevant signature.
@_date: 2017-02-24 19:03:59
I'm fine with this. Sounds plausible
@_date: 2017-02-20 16:38:01

Every Trump supporter ever:

Litecoin is a hard fork of bitcoin isn't it?
@_date: 2017-02-23 10:31:49
Not at all because there aren't any. I personally see no issue with the current blocksize.
Side chains/SegWit/LN make the most sense to me.
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:51:42
I thought this to be the case. I don't know why they don't just do it
@_date: 2017-02-27 19:56:08
If Bitcoin forks the one true idea/implementation will probably prevail. We may see fluctuations in the price but nothing substantial.
Segwit offers off chain scaling solutions. Segregated witness means that a third party verifies the off chain transactions that have taken place.
BUs implementation allows miners to control the blocksize so they can include more transactions per block. While this seems innocuous to the layman, it is nefarious in so far as it removes nakamoto consensus and centralises the network. These ideas are completely against what Bitcoin was originally developed for.
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:20:29
Can you explain how you regulate such an exchange? Or even ban it?
Reason I'm asking is because I don't think China can do either of those things.

I don't understand how they're not creating their own chains?

No, the chain forks because 49% don't agree on that transaction. Whilst 51% go off on their own chain, 49% will stay where they are, working on *their* own chain.

The number of transactions sitting in the mempool is increasing so the time to confirm transactions goes up right, whilst still only maintaining 3.5 tps

Why would the users do that? Miners won't include your transactions in their blocks will they?

What other network is there?
@_date: 2017-02-28 01:09:40
So long as you recirculate the outputs into blocks that aren't selecting transactions using that algorithm they'll get consolidated with larger inputs on another block and all is well right?
@_date: 2017-02-26 18:06:57
We need more nodes. Miners are nodes too, maybe that's where they get the idea that they have the power from.
@_date: 2017-02-26 10:29:39
Can you explain more about how miners currently have power please? And how it isn't currently the nodes that control the valid transactions?

Don't you find the parity with gold kind of irrelevant? It seems like a bit of a mental barrier rather than a financial one. Especially when we expect bitcoin to reach lofty heights.
@_date: 2017-02-14 23:38:30
I think my worst fear is if nothing happens.
I think confidence in decentralisation would wane due to the greed of the few. That 15% over at BU, or anyone that supports any effort at centralisation are the greedy few from my lay-persons perspective.

So what's the outcome? Using your numbers we get
5.1/7500/1174 = 0.00000057BTC on average per transaction.
Or 57 satoshis per transaction.
Now 7500 is not a high number in the mempool but 57 satoshis equates to something ridiculously small in dollars.

Personally I haven't encountered too many issues either but how is Bitcoin supposed to compete with fiat currencies or credit or debit cards?
Just using LN and scaling solutions that don't affect the block size? (I understand LN figuratively expands the block size to 2MB without taking up more disk space)
Can future scaling solutions reach confirmations for 50000 tps?

Do you mean in Bitcoin or this discussion?

As above the vast majority have 1 input and 2 outputs
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:02:41
Perhaps someone would care to explain what I'm missing then? The block size is fixed and only a certain number of transactions can be verified from what I understand.

So ChairmanOfBitcoin either didn't know that or is deliberately being obtuse. Because no one outside of the development team should be able to get ideas implemented.

@_date: 2017-02-26 18:05:23
Bitcoin is an idea dude. It's all about decentralisation of currency. People feel passionately about the topic hence the reaction I suspect.
They think that centralisation is a good thing which it obviously isn't when you have the opposing viewpoint and have bought in at $1000 a BTC that was the trust placed in the system.
To destroy the idea is to destroy the system

Nice round up of recent goings on there
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:54:33


* You need to understand the difference between hard forks and soft forks first
* You need to understand the difference between on-chain scaling and off-chain scaling
When you understand these two things you may see why block size is irrelevant and why BU call it "kicking the can down the road" and why Core are happy with SegWit (and Lightning Networks)

Bitcoin/Core/Nakamoto are​ of the same ideology. If you try to deviate from the $20 Billion brand then people reign you in. Do you really think enough core developers could somehow sneak a shit load of code in that no one notices? Or that if a fork occurred the Nakamoto ideology wouldn't​ prevail using the name Bitcoin?
I think it would be a very surprising day if somehow Bitcoin became a tool to *help* the oligarchy and governments.
@_date: 2017-03-26 21:16:05
It is answered. You have nodes with port 8333 open, these are the 7000.

To be fair there are notorious coders responsible for the majority of the code that probably should receive the recognition at least occasionally.

Agreed and more so
@_date: 2017-03-01 12:09:53
You understand BU isn't just about increasing the blocksize?
It is about handing blocksize control to the miners. This would immediately and irreparably centralise the network.
That would no longer make it Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-21 10:13:00

Well, it would activate before then because the hash rate would be over 95%, if I'm correct
If there's a hard fork, both have 100% hash rate for their own chains.
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:32:07
So why did it pump so hard then crash?

Your shortsightedness is shining through.
Increasing the Block size hard limit only increases the size of the block chain. Sure you'll be able to fit more transactions in there fpr a time but you soon hit the limit again, probably within a year or two as has been shown by the soft cap that used to be in place.

@_date: 2017-03-26 12:04:40
I just learned about that signature aggregation the other day. Schnorr signatures are quite an elegant but simple solution to saving space and to think they considered it's use due to their scalability makes me trust core even more. 
I mean segwit is infinite scaling of the block chain from what I can see and schnorr is infinite scaling of the security.
I love it

Why would people ever withdraw otherwise?
It makes sense that they submit a sound proposition of rule changes that don't negatively affect anyone. That's all they've had to do. The SEC have to find something wrong with the proposals and listen to opposition's to the proposals.
If no-one opposes and they can't find problems they'll let it go through probably without deciding either way.
I guess this saves someone's bacon if anyone did make a decision. No one can be blamed if no decision is made and yet the rules say it gets approved.

*When* would a non-upgraded miner have majority or minority hash power? And of what hash power?

We will see I guess. I think it's in time. Especially given the potential benefits and the contention surrounding Bitcoin right now.

I agree.
They almost certainly have decided what they're going to do.
It makes perfect sense to continue with the status quo which, for 3 years, has been to keep quiet.

I'm not entirely sure how BU will be able to fork without it being a hard fork
@_date: 2017-03-20 23:10:41
I would recommend to continue using the development team with the best track record, so no is the answer to your question.
@_date: 2017-03-21 14:22:42
Do slushpool individual miners choose who they signal for? Or do slush control the entire pool?
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:44:50
Did you mean tenet?
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:57:59
Not if they're mining their own chains
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:35:07
Do you think the miners are the community?
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:27:12
Just a point of semantics. How can you know what you don't know?

You only need to be on 0.13.1 and up to "signal" segwit ready I believe. I remember seeing a chart with 85%+ nodes on that version or higher already. Unfortunately they're not listening nodes but that doesn't matter since when the October switch gets flipped most will be on that version or higher and the rest will be forced to upgrade or will naturally fork.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:27:46
The individual can signal who they want right?

Go on, I'm all ears

If they control the maximum blocksize they can control the economy from what I understand.
The current blocksize is not currently a limiting factor. The mempool has been fluctuating in size but clearly not to bitcoins detriment.
Edit: Not the economy but it does break nakamoto consensus.

What if people don't vote when they're ~~super owed~~ **supposed** too?
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:15:32
Whilst i agree, the block size is not the problem. As i demonstrated with my previous comment. It has maxed out twice now, in quick succession.
Were it to max out under BU the network would crash.
@_date: 2017-03-14 21:44:11
Block size is irrelevant. Scalling is more important.
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:05:34
I am the biggest advocate for Bitcoin. I am a lowly person but have been involved (a user) since you were able to mine on gpu and when the price was around $6-11.
I still think public mod logs should actually be a feature of **Reddit**. I'm not sure why transparency shouldn't be a feature of one of the most interesting websites in the world.
Imagine what The_Donalds figures would look like. It would stop them or rbtc from ever gaining notoriety in the first place.
If you took this stance instead of "if they won't do it we won't" then I think you'd be in a very strong position. Maybe the subs that use public logs could petition Reddit for the introduction of such a feature. Default is on perhaps, turn it off if you want.
I'm not going anywhere regardless. I like things the way they are and I can't see how I wouldn't be happy with Core or discussing Bitcoin here.
@_date: 2017-03-23 20:29:58
There is a ~~graph~~ chart for that here I think

@_date: 2017-03-21 10:02:50
Everyone uses a 2nd Layer (or 3rd Party) already.
Internal transactions on many exchanges or game sites occur already. These are trust based with zero fees. Miners see none of the money of those transactions.

I don't think the rhetoric will ever stop around Bitcoin, and given its potential I'm not surprised.
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:01:18
I would argue if you know how to use Bitcoin you can probably work out how to use Tor or a VPN.

That would likely​ happen in time but believe so.

Everything Core does is bad according to this guy.
Why doesn't he just fork already if he's so right?
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:37:12
How quickly do you propose the blocksize is increased?
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:19:34
With ports open
@_date: 2017-03-18 10:47:49
That's because miners are not the economic majority
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:28:36
I would happily see Bitcoin hard fork if it meant all the BUers were off of the main chain
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:14:42
Started looking into it a couple of days ago. Should be able to secure the network because anyone can mine. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 11:34:16


I guess we'll be disagreeing on quite a fundamental point then.

What makes you think off-chain scaling is going to be centralized?
@_date: 2017-03-14 20:29:47
Yeah $2 is too high for ~$250. It will get confirmed fine but you will lose $2. You only need maybe 25000 satoshis for that transaction. It all depends on how many inputs and outputs there are.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:31:17
It doesn't matter if they can because that will be an altcoin then

@_date: 2017-03-18 13:59:38
I assume it does since we will be working on different chains and BU will be a hard fork at that point.
Thing is we may have longer mining times between blocks, the mempool will increase in size and number of transactions.
I can't see how we can't afford not to pre-emptively hard fork to avoid the network congesting, BU are likely to fork (if they can sort out replay protection) at an inconvenient time, just after difficulty adjustment.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:05:36
That could easily be an autocorrect
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:57:03
What? 8333 is the port you need to open to be a node that relays transactions to the rest of the network I believe.

Attacking a chain would require hash power to be put into that chain, why would they mine anything other than their own "profitable" chain?

So it will take a longer time to mine the next block if they fork until the difficulty readjustment?

Is that meant as a compliment?
@_date: 2017-03-21 00:16:45

@_date: 2017-01-04 19:09:00
It's not hyperinflation if bitcoin is accepted everywhere. It does need to become more widely accepted before it really starts to affect the price of national currencies.
My idea is pure speculation but derived from historical data.
I don't know what a bitcoin or a dollar would buy then because I really don't know the impact of what I've suggested. We're entering uncharted territory where financial borders will be broken down and the price of goods will be relatively even globally.
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:57:19
You can't because they haven't forked long enough to do that. Does anyone else notice they're still operating at blocks every 20+ minutes. That's why they have a smaller blockchain (and fewer transactions), also note BTC mempool is still being spammed.
Edit: in brackets
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:42:21
Someone stopped spamming the mempool?
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:55:28
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:52:37
Good point but I anticipate the slow will balance out that acceleration and may even continue to trend the way it currently is which fwiw by no means a slow upward trend.
If it goes on to break $2000 by then end of next week then that also could help with a surge.
This is going to be an interesting couple of weeks at least.
@_date: 2017-01-14 13:43:25
Yeah any attempts to legitimise any alternates to Bitcoin in themselves strengthen Bitcoin. There's no way every nation on the planet is going to drop their fiats for decentralised currencies and so it goes that it will be a slow subtle destabilisation of a nations fiat until there is no choice but bitcoin.
I also believe we are past the point of no return, perhaps we were already there at $10 a coin, who knows.

@_date: 2017-08-02 15:47:22
It may take more or less time depending on your internet connection. Was taking me 4 or 5 days to download the entire blockchain but some wallets automatically prune the blockchain to speed that process up.
I also don't actually know of any bch wallets out there. But then I haven't looked either.
@_date: 2017-08-03 09:06:47


What makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:56:14


Not true, both chains will fluctuate until the prices adjust to the point where one chain is the outright most profitable.
Given the price has moved with technical upgrades in the past and the number of commits made on either client Bitcoin Core will probably win out.
@_date: 2017-01-02 19:14:52

When we cash out to a relative currency it kind of is isn't it? Each fork that doesn't devalue the original chain devalues the real world currencies surely? How can $5B pop into existence and not affect anything?

No worries I just wanted to highlight how speculative I was being.
It's almost unfathomable but if someone had told me 3 or 4 years ago whenever bitcoin was £6 that it would be worth best part of a thousand I obviously would have kept everything I had bought back then but now I'm resting on a fraction of a coin hoping for the best.

@_date: 2017-01-04 19:27:16
I don't because this is uncharted territory. What I'm suggesting is as the confidence in bitcoin grows the confidence in fiat currencies will shrink, especially as bitcoin becomes more widely adopted and people understand the benefits of a decentralised digital cryptocurrency. This will inflate the price of the currencies as every country tries to sell off their bonds in one another leading to more inflation, perhaps hyperinflation.
When we get to these realms who knows what the price will be or what the price of goods will be, it could be one millibit is a loaf of bread but also 2 or 3 dollars.
All the above is speculation
@_date: 2017-01-03 19:03:41

Hashrate is how much power (energy) miners are putting into solving for new blocks.
Hashrate defines how frequently new transactions are included in new blocks.

How is the price changing? There's no new blocks
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:16:27
So this probably people that have old miners laying around switching them on. At least that's what it looks like to me.

Would a hard fork ever be called Bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-08-30 10:25:34
I use this site and blockchair.com and fork.lol.
Best resources to analyse what's really happening on that POW and chain splits in my opinion.
If you're reading this thank you to the developers of these sites
@_date: 2017-08-20 08:48:47
There would be a hard fork then on the original to change the POW. Need to keep up security and what better way than opening it up to everyone. Several devs have suggested this may happen anyway.

The legacy chain is larger in size as you can see here

I was on an old account

I change my account quite often. Not sure my actions are negotiable.
@_date: 2017-08-24 10:02:16
We're almost at that 30 blocks an hour again.
But as you say there's no real value in the other chain except for pumping and dumping.
And maybe making fractions more than the legacy chain occasionally.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:37:25
The high fees must be users unaware of how to set fees. An average of $4.50 is ridiculous but then I saw a guy the other day say that $4 was too high a fee to send $10, doesn't that make you think there's a lot of these idiots that think that's ok and press send anyway. If they had read a little then they would know what fee was reasonable but again with all the FUD it's difficult for some.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:17:52
Because you don't control your private keys and therefore your Bitcoin there.

It does seem a little fraudulent when Bcash will never be accepted in any shops. Look at every other crypto, Litecoin, the original fork, still not accepted in shops. 
Bitcoin is the only one that merchants have come to adopted.

That only woked for a set period in time
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:39:57
I'm in two minds. If they identified a flaw in their security they should pay the person who identified the flaw. The fact that someone is holding IP hostage kind of doesn't matter.
Although maybe they shouldn't pay so as to have a united front with other corporate entities that get hacked.
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:11:09
If you have the private keys, import them into a wallet that supports BCH and voila, you have the coin, then you have to find a buyer.
Edit: Some more info
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:00:54
The number of transactions per second plus the unwieldy nature of a blockchain that increases faster than consumer storage does. 
Decentralisation requires the everyone to be able to verify their own transactions using their own copy of the blockchain. Otherwise we start having to trust a third party and that defeats the point.

Can you elaborate? I don't quite understand the Lighting network yet.
I understand it is going to allow millisecond speed payments and satoshi sized transaction fees but that's all I understand. Are there any changes that need to be made to wallets to make them work?

Tl;Dr: 1 BTC = 16,000,000 USD within the next decade or so.
We've had roughly 14 doublings since the genesis block (I know it's more, just used $0.07 from coinbase) 8 years ago. Stick another 14 doublings in the next 8 years and that takes us to roughly 16 Million dollars a coin with a market cap of 2.7 quadrillion dollars.
Given the fact the dollar will lose it's purchasing power along with every other currency in the world I see this as a real possibility.
Maybe not in the 8 years specified but it's certainly an eventuality.

Why do some shops already accept it then? It's because people that understand already believe in it.
It will continue to be accepted and cashed out until people can use it in their every day lives for most things then people won't cash out. And that's it. What value would dollars or euros or sterling have then?
The price of a bitcoin will be measured against a loaf of bread or maybe the reserve currency, gold. There always has to be a reserve right?

I'm sure Soros was accused of destabilising the pound to his own benefit so yeah it probably is of interest to some.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:54:56
There's far less to say about BCH these days since the chain will almost certainly be less profitable to mine going forwards.
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:59:05
Because they have to keep fluctuating back and forth between quick blocks and slow blocks. Which means transactions build up and they have to fill the slow blocks completely. Mempool builds up then you have to fork to bigger blocks to keep up. Centralisation ensues.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:14:00
Because we finally have some forward motion again?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:24:19
I never said dead, I was merely trying to point out how improbable it would be for the legacy chain to ever be less profitable to mine.

@_date: 2017-08-20 08:43:04
And the mining difficulty goes up and Jihan gets left on his own when miners flip back to BTC.
The flip flopping is akin to changing lanes in traffic. Gets you nowhere but uses a lot of effort.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:07:03
I don't need it pointed out slowly or quickly. The only way it may not have been 0% would be due to rounding since you can't have a negative hashrate. I assume you understand how simple mathematics work?
    (1+0)/2 = 1/2
    (0+0)/2 = 0
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:56:07
Yeah this is kind of what I was thinking. It may be expensive to move coin on the first layer in the future?

@_date: 2017-08-28 18:37:34
You have a seriously weird post history
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:27:22
Not necessarily. The average frequency of blocks could indicate a particular hashrate but with variances it's pretty difficult to be accurate.
@_date: 2017-08-20 09:36:22
It becomes invalid when the next block is mined.
You would have to know the difference in the blockchain to know it may become orphaned before the next block is mined. Which seems improbable from my perspective unless you're somehow relaying blocks in different parts of the world then comparing every recently mined block all before the next block is mined.
Someone please correct me if I'm wrong. I probably haven't read as much as I should about orphans.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:32:19
To open and close lightning network channels a fee is paid. Because the fee would probably be the same for everyone it appears that fees become subscription rather than competitive. This is what I **guess** he meant.

They'll never be the longest chain now that profitability is dropping like a lead balloon
@_date: 2017-08-24 15:33:58


Would do if they were mining blocks every 7 hours and had anywhere near as many transactions as the legacy chain.
@_date: 2017-08-08 08:27:47


Er don't talk shit.
How would miners get isolated by upgrading to a client that is supported by the majority of the network?
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:56:25
But they could sell it privately.
@_date: 2017-08-07 16:59:50
XT and Classic enforce the old consensus? Are they even forks at this point?
@_date: 2017-08-19 07:59:17
I'm not sure that's true, the difficulty has dropped low enough that individuals with racks of miners could potentially be mining without a pool.

@_date: 2017-08-08 19:52:24


**Blocks** get orphaned but rarely these days
@_date: 2017-01-15 09:49:28
I think this is right. Lightning network is a 2nd layer of transactions, off of the blockchain and verified by a 3rd party. The public blockchain is updated when you close your trading channel on the 2nd layer.
~~Edit: SegWit = Segregated Witness / The 3rd party~~
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:04:20
Yes and the price goes up. Lots of coin is already "lost". Irretrievable. As the halvings continue and the maximum coin number approaches and adoption increases the price will exponentially grow until full global integration at which point bitcoin could be worth in excess of tens of (maybe hundreds) millions of USD per coin.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:12:53
Not impossible. You'll need to download a wallet that's compatible with BCH, import the private key from the BTC wallet then move the coin to an exchange and sell.
@_date: 2017-08-08 09:40:43
Just connect to the FIBRE network they'll be fine.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:28:52
Not necessarily, but we won't be pegging bitcoin against any fiat
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:35:50
No you don't, they don't use the same Genesis block iirc
@_date: 2017-08-31 16:18:52
I thought they were fairly conservative about their opinion. I disagree but I also don't think they're talking out of their ass.
@_date: 2017-08-20 10:31:02
I've got my antikythera mechanism ready.
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:56:09
It somewhat works like that yes but not all exchanges allow adjustment of fees.
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:18:05
I've not been following for a while. What's the crack? Any links to some in depth insight of what you're referring to?
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:15:57
My guess is widespread adoption within 15/20 years, which would place it in unknown territory as it destabilizes fiat currencies. What do you peg it against when you're using wheelbarrows to move your dollars to pay for groceries.
Maybe gold, so I would say Bitcoin will be worth 3800 troy ounces, ($5 Million today)
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:41:28
Consensus need to be ubiquitous otherwise we get issues with orphaned blocks.
I agree that there should be blocksize increases but set at predetermined points in the future that correspond to global average internet speeds.
@_date: 2017-08-29 06:06:26
My point was more about how mainstream Bitcoin is at all. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:38:23
Probably not. I don't know of any online wallets that allow you access to your private key or even wallet seed.
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:34:32
I'm not asking you to. The theory that enough miners are going to swap to a less profitable chain is nothing more than fantasy
@_date: 2017-08-07 08:58:38
How do you know they're full nodes?
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:42:30
What merchants accept BCH or an other altcoin that's been far longer established?
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:29:25
In the recent fork there was no noticeable effect on the main chain. What do you make of that?
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:53:05
@_date: 2017-08-06 09:15:44
Mining will never be complete but we will approach 0 remaining blocks around 2140 so make of that what you will.
Personally I don't think money will be an issue then.
@_date: 2017-08-12 08:20:29
Nah, this is a years worth (at least) of the price being stifled finally getting released imo
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:33:23

Unconfirmed transactions with reasonable fees could be cleared in 10 blocks.
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:15:50
Ah the sell off before. Or at least less investment beforehand. I get it now.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:21:53
It's perceived value. So not inflation. If anything it just increases the market cap. And it always takes time to settle to the real perceived value which is why BCH is worth less than BTC
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:19:19


That's optimistic isn't it? How high do you think it will go?
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:22:08
A fork that has the same POW is relevant
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:00:30
Exactly but it also spreads the time further from the average time to solve for a block.
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:40:38
No, they said it was resource intensive so they may not add that
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:35:07

I set that bar in my mind earlier today. I got 10k before the end of the year right.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:27:53
Knock 2-3 million off for 'lost' coin. And still I can find someone to buy it from. It's not scarce if people have it to sell for fiat. When that is all people have and the dollar hyperinflates then it will start to become "scarce", but again only to a point.
A soft fork to break bitcoin into further fractions could be on the cards when that happens.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:09:03
What makes you say that?
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:32:55
I see. Well you end up with 21000000 either way, whether it's satoshis or bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-11 08:18:15
Bitcoin doesn't react to difficulty adjustments. BCH does.
I think this shows that Bitcoin is resistant to gaming whereas BCH is only really being gamed, nothing else is happening over there. 
For example it's not being used as an investment vehicle or a currency or a store of wealth.

What I was alluding to was that of the price goes to a point where a satoshi won't buy you a loaf of bread you're going to have to break it up more. Yes this is fungibility but it is related to scarcity and consequent price hikes

How frequently does the EDA adjust on Cash these days? I was under the impression it adjusts more quickly than before rather than having been removed completely.
This makes sense as to why miners are not working on that chain anymore as you can't game something you can't predict.

Nothing *could* happen and Bitcoin would still be the most popular crypto in its current form. It does however, as you rightly say, need to innovate to compete. Modern ideas have to be incorporated to persist with modernity and attractiveness.
Nothing else commpares so nothing will beat Bitcoin. The tenets of Bitcoin are what make it Bitcoin. Change the tenets and you change to something other than Bitcoin.

Can you not tell that that guy just wrote that? Bitcoin has to stay true to it's tenets to be called Bitcoin. A centralised coin is not Bitcoin and any attempt to attack the network will result in a POW change and probably a hard fork.

This is not how you devolve power to the masses. Miner are not the controllers. They simply make the chain secure.
Full nodes relay the valid blocks. Invalid blocks mined get orphaned.
Checks and balances, the nodes check the miners are securing their chain with the rules they set out.
Since there are far more nodes than miners I would say this is more decentralised than before. If mining power becomes centralised then we change the POW

I'm pretty certain that Reddit recognises this and discounts your votes.

They would also investigate brigading if reported.
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:48:54

You're right, 11 in 22 is nowhere near 12 in 60.

I make that more than £100000 given the mempool continues to fluctuate upward throughout the "attack" from 10 BTC back up to 17 BTC. That doesn't really matter other than to say it halves the amount of time for an attack. There aren't many in crypto that would know how to or want to sustain such an attack. I can only think of two people but still to sustain an attack you'd be wasting a lot of money and not really holding things up that much.

Nothing is ever really removed from the system. Bitcoin is literally just addresses and transactions and a ledger of everything that came before. So someone creates a bitcoin transaction and it waits in the mempool before being included in the next block (providing the fee is sufficient). When it is included this is called a confirmation.
Fees are collected by the miner that mines the block

If you want to accept Bitcoin payments in store then the best way is to just set up a wallet so you can monitor transactions from within each store then print your wallet address on a QR code and you can start accepting payments.
If you want to sell the Bitcoin you own to people that come into the store, do that, don't use a third party. You could easily sell for the price listed at Bitcoinity.org/markets plus a fee.

That's because it was never meant to activate, it was designed to force a MASF and that's what's happening with 2x.
2x is compatible with core 014.1 and up I believe (may well be earlier versions that are also compatible) until they try to hard fork later when it will become incompatible and miners will switch back to core because the majority of nodes will reject the 2mb blocks and they'll have no transactions on their hardforked altcoin
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:53:03
Those nodes aren't switching from tested code to segwit2x which has the potentially dangerous activation method
@_date: 2017-05-14 08:02:38
 I guess we change the POW with every iteration of Bitcoin then
@_date: 2017-07-18 17:20:06

@_date: 2017-07-18 10:31:59

Nodes won't upgrade to 2x, this is miner code only and if the miners hard fork in November they'll find an awful lot of nodes rejecting their bigger blocks. I think then POW change will be necessary so that ASICs aren't in the mix anymore and so as to secure the 1x chain

Accept Bitcoin. Save it. You won't get so many sales that it will affect your bottom line. It'll be a nice nest egg. When you start to accrue enough to think about selling you'll already be educated enough to know how to sell effectively. People will want to talk to you about accepting Bitcoin. You'll meet people to sell to.

I see what you're saying but most people using lightning networks won't have (sole) access to the private key of the wallet I don't think.
Alternatively, it may be that smaller vendors set up LN "accounts" with customers at the start of a week then settle that channel at the end of the week.
I doubt we're going to see much change in terms of regulation because of Segwit or LN

@_date: 2017-07-30 09:28:45
Down votes because you're wrong.
1. You can change wallet at any time
2. The blockchain takes ages to download on an average connection already. Bigger blocks means more users unable to verify their own transactions.
3. Segwit creates more space for transactions off chain. It is literally the only way to scale flexibly.
@_date: 2017-07-17 19:09:58
So Blockstream controls a group of over 100 devs right?
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:59:12

Defeats? Kind of yes, November may see some similar turmoil to the next two days but far worse in my opinion. The attempt to hard fork to 2MB will be met with a great deal of resistance, especially since literally none of the nodes (excluding the miners) are incentivised to run 2X

Not without profit because there will still be fees and inflation against fiat currencies. When we get to the point that Bitcoin is the only currency off chain scaling will be absolutely necessary as individuals wont pay the fees necessary given the value of Bitcoin.
Imagine Bitcoin is worth a million dollars each, individuals can't afford to pay the fees then, which means businesses have to use Bitcoin as a settlement layer and regardless of the reward per block, miners will get lots of value for their efforts in finding a block.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:16:13

Needs to otherwise this isn't happening this period
@_date: 2017-07-19 21:11:34
I gave up downloading the blockchain the other day because of the time it takes. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 08:52:29
I calculated based on 16500000 - 21000000 million coin in existence
@_date: 2017-07-12 21:20:17
If you don't understand how a POW change can secure the network by redecentralising then you don't understand Bitcoin. Currently the control is in the hands of the miners few. After it will be the miners many that choose.
@_date: 2017-07-20 09:48:51
Ah, of course. This is why latency matters so much I guess. Especially with such a large value placed on each block mined.
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:39:50
Kind of, but it's not apparent from a blockchain explorer
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:47:23
Would you like to find 'them' saying: "that Segwit2x is not compatible with other Segwit implementations"?
I'd like to know which developers said this?
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:53:54
So you're saying push the boundaries and not stay well within working systems boundaries?
I have to tell you being risky makes no sense to me with a $40 Billion system
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:45:46
Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:19:48
But their site has still been seized by the Feds. I would suggest BTC-e are probably still lying.
@_date: 2017-05-16 09:41:30
What is real then?
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:22:18
Anyone in the UK used the Mycelium credit card purchase function?
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:57:30
Well all cryptos are premines of varying degrees in your eyes? Who's the best?
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:03:19
Average internet connection in the UK is 15MB/s
Lighting networks, schnorr signatures and segwit have the potential for infinite scaling
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:28:55
I can't tell whether you're being sarcastic or not. 2x will activate segwit
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:01:43
Ok. People wanted segwit. What's your proposal?
@_date: 2017-07-17 22:31:05
Why do you demean what so many believe in? I would happily mine as part of a pool using my CPU if it means I get to earn Bitcoin and secure the network.
Actually it's the miners that create the altcoin in that situation
@_date: 2017-07-24 12:34:33
Bad bot
@_date: 2017-07-20 07:38:49
Orphaned blocks are not a good thing at all. The current blocksize makes the block chain barely downloadable by the average user. Not what was envisaged at the start, but why Max block size was introduced at all.
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:35:46
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:09:10
Does Bitcoin work in it's current format? So where's the incentive to hold hostage parts of the network?
@_date: 2017-05-02 16:14:13


Of course it does if "more miners participate"
@_date: 2017-05-14 14:25:51
I don't know enough about cryptography but how about a POW change every update
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:27:57
It was a few select miners who signalled using the vast numbers of ASICs they produce. Why do you not see how the network has become relatively centralised around a select few.
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:29:48
So I assume whoever mines the next block decides which will be the longer chain
@_date: 2017-07-04 18:24:16
Did they do it in error?
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:38:13
There is good returns on mining equipment, I've heard six months to return your investment as part of a pool, that was as late as the start of the year.
@_date: 2017-07-19 15:15:55
They're behind a bit I believe
@_date: 2017-07-21 19:12:25
Bitcoin isn't alive. The people using it are.
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:32:01
I don't know how to tell but this was a BIP91 block apparently
@_date: 2017-05-06 10:27:48
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:10:00
I get it now
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:46:19
People will simply move back to Core if/when things get fucked up by BTC1
@_date: 2017-07-12 11:37:27
That ��
@_date: 2017-05-11 16:50:19
I'm quite the amateur economist, does the market cap interest relate to the investment over the last 24 hours or is there no link other than the price people are willing to pay for it?
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:14:23
Any wallet. Back up the private key to paper and usb twice
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:02:52
What's consensus breaking about it?
@_date: 2017-07-12 10:18:51
Does the mempool drop in size coincide with any of this?
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:25:31
But legally it hasn't been defined as such
@_date: 2017-07-04 19:03:52
Why are there so many UASF websites?
@_date: 2017-07-09 10:40:39
So Bitcoin is an asset? Has that been defined somewhere yet?
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:01:36
That hard fork won't happen.
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:24:06
The only ones that matter any more that aren't signalling are F2Pool (possibly trolling) and Slush (said they'll commit) but no blocks coming out of them at the moment anyways
@_date: 2017-07-15 08:41:47


How so?
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:40:06
Bitcoin is trustless because you check yours and everyone else's transactions against your copy of the ledger (blockchain). In a system with trust you rely on a third party.
@_date: 2017-07-03 22:41:01
It'll be too late before governments will be able to act
@_date: 2017-07-18 10:06:40
I get that, but it was meant to "game" the miners into activating.
It even says it here
Also note that (if I'm correct) the version bit signalling could indicate that miners are mining using Core + BIP91 and not BTC1
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:26:45
London, although Kent is going to be more fruitful in my opinion
@_date: 2017-07-08 13:08:48
Which is fine, miners switch to segwit2x, segwit gets activated then everyone switches back to core
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:02:37
Game theory is perplexing sometimes
@_date: 2017-07-20 08:02:34
That's how it's supposed to work I believe. You find your block and relay it to as many nodes as possible to create the longest valid chain accepted most widely. Otherwise you get blocks orphaned, I don't know how orphans are actually decided to be orphans.
Perhaps someone could explain the process of a block getting orphaned?
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:07:13
So Litecoin is immune to politics?
@_date: 2017-07-09 10:05:05
If BIP148 rejects blocks how is that not a hard fork?
@_date: 2017-07-25 23:01:08
Best in terms of the control the premine potentially has over the price
@_date: 2017-07-25 09:32:23
In my opinion 2x hard fork is a bad thing. It takes too long to download the blockchain already. Off chain scaling is better, I don't need to see every coffee bought, just that every business is doing their accounting correctly.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:42:19
That comment doesn't explain what you're talking about. But then I don't understand how you think transactions take *work*?
@_date: 2017-07-30 10:47:35
You won't see that in a block chain explorer from what I understand
@_date: 2017-07-17 10:46:31
Because of the NYA
I support segwit by any activation method. This hard fork to 2mb will never happen
@_date: 2017-07-08 09:30:24
That's correct. I'm not sure it will even happen that way but some hashing power will no doubt be put into it if it comes to it. Many have signalled, &gt;50% is all it needs if it needs it it may require less but that remains to be seen, time to solve for a block on each chain would determine the outcome in my opinion)
@_date: 2017-06-01 10:00:16
What do you think is the activation method most are behind?
@_date: 2017-07-17 20:15:23
You're right, this is for miners only 
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:40:12
So is there a separate page for mobile then?
@_date: 2017-07-09 10:09:44
When the next adjustment comes along
@_date: 2017-06-02 23:23:55
Bitcoin was the first real crypto?
@_date: 2017-06-20 07:58:34
Don't keep your​ coin on an exchange throughout tumult.
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:56:54
Well, ok this is the first layer. There'll be other layers, though what's specified to happen will be enough in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:09:28
Of course it is since you banded over a hundred developers into the phrase "core developers"
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:31:30
Hardware wallet. On your computer, back up your private key.
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:32:02
~~This is the issue here. He could have just found any transaction with a high enough value sitting in the mempool?~~
Edit: Having looked through some account history this is unlikely
@_date: 2017-07-20 15:02:57
Because I can't predict the short term *and* the above
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:56:17
Where are you getting 0.3% hash rate from?
@_date: 2017-06-14 08:29:40
Ok Adolffuckler one day old account
@_date: 2017-06-20 15:20:36
Says who?
@_date: 2017-06-06 13:26:00
UASF day. Some people are going to try and fork the chain to accept only segwit blocks. Someone correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-03 09:21:15
What's this referring to? BIP148?
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:01:55
I'm inclined to agree but I also assume these are ASICs coming online. How could they be GPUs? So also who is producing ASICs in this volume and are they benefitting from ASICBOOST?

Deadmans email with the password in it? Encrypted with the recipients PGP?

Why are satoshis coins lost?
@_date: 2017-07-11 13:21:32
Decisions are based upon the client you run. They enforce the rules. The miners include transactions in blocks and are rewarded the block reward plus the fees included in that block.
Pertaining to your last, the blockchain won't become unwieldy if the block size remains the same.
@_date: 2017-06-24 10:13:01
Not if they outlaw Bitcoin terminals/transactions inside the country in favour of their own currency.
@_date: 2017-06-04 03:36:49
I thought you were joking
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:14:08
BIP149 is incompatible with BIP141 until after November 15th
From the authors mouth:
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:37:38
Do you mean a reflection in the price?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:26:45
Is his Bitcoin address known?
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:32:54
The majority are behind segwit
@_date: 2017-07-13 10:57:24
Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks (roughly 2 weeks), according to the amount of hash power available (iirc), there's a certain amount of gaming involved in mining

Did he sell his account?
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:51:19

@_date: 2017-07-20 10:06:35
Segwit is here! (In a month or so)
Edit: Literally F2P and Slush to go and they've both committed to it
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:56:20
This is a tiny bubble $3000 then back to $2800, then tomorrow something similar all the way up to August 1st then it's either moon or "hello darkness my old friend"
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:44:24
What? Tell me how it won't? Segwit plus Schnorr plus LN = infinite scaling from my perspective
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:42:13
So how many lines is this because on my phone it looks like 6.
Also finding their specific location in the blockchain indicates they know a single address that contains all or a majority of the coins that have definitively been traced from Mt Gox to this address.
Why would they tell the general public they know where the coin is? Surely the perp just mixes/tumbles the coins and they have to go through chain analysis all over to try to trace the coin again.
Either they just gave their game away inadvertently or this is bullshit
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:34:17
So it could be a rogue app approved by an app store running in the background
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:36:48
They could purchase something and sell it on (like drugs) to launder the coin

Last I heard they were just looking into it. Is it implemented?
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:43:02
I was looking for it but couldn't find it. It mentions Bitcoin is good or the tech is at the most
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:35:37
Where's the liquidity in ETH? Most of ethereum is not available to the market so an invalid market cap.
If they flooded the market with the premined ETH the value would plummet

Is artificial inflation recognisable these days?
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:36:04


LN is there pretty much there, maybe I misconstrued this but LN just needs to be applied and adopted by a couple of larger exchanges and I think that's all that will be needed for a grander test case.
Other exchanges will apply in time and then it will be quite difficult to spam the blockchain effectively again I think.
@_date: 2017-07-03 23:05:36
How is LN not second layer?
@_date: 2017-06-19 09:21:33
What website says 0.3%?
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:40:10
The longer term there are no limits in the same way Bitcoin came from a zero price. It was immeasurably low and will get to a point where the value is immeasurable again. I don't know what that is but a tipping point over fiats will change things in an unprecedented way.
@_date: 2017-06-05 22:04:11
Get rid of the pgp requirement then. Just deadmans email with the password in it
