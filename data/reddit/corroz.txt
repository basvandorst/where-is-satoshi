Wahoo! Now I can buy more from my next paycheck.

It means you are in it for the endgame, best perspective on it all.

I believe LTC has some catching up to to, I think if you hold LTC for awhile longer you might see a good opportunity to get a higher percentage of a bitcoin.  LTC is still undervalued.

Wooo, I am glad it stablized, but I was hoping to catch a dip at 10k.

This is a huge drop...its not a bad thing.  I just get to double my buying power when it hits 10k.

I am not a professional, so don't listen to me, I think we are going to see 11-12k, don't panic, don't check your prices, you wont even remember this panic in a few months after all the gains.

Honestly, I am too lazy to cite anything for you, there are plenty of numbers and charts anyone can google.  I honestly don't think the dollar is going anywhere.  There is enough market room for bitcoin to hit 100k and not even make the fiat market flinch.   I think we are going to see a symbiotic relationship in the future.

Not with this big of a correction.   This is FUD.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:22
I hope so?

For those that are afraid, zoom out, we are all hodling for 100k+, even 1 million.    Optimisticly it was still going to take 5-10 years of big growing pains.  Chill, relax and hodl, don't play the "what if" game.  Witness history and a revolution!
