Any idea how much Bitcoin total was deposited in Bitfinex?
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:56:15
It's only been a few days.  Give it time...
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:56:51
Give it 5-6 years and I think the answer will be a resounding 'Yes".  Bitcoin is here to stay.
@_date: 2016-08-02 17:25:46
I actually agree here.  The vault is safe, Coinbase is backed up by major corporations and is insured.  It's just as safe IMO as keeping cash n a Bank of america bank account.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 15:56:15
It's only been a few days.  Give it time...
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:07:59
This would make Bitcoin take off big time.
@_date: 2016-04-28 20:29:48
I wonder what the percentage is here in the US.  I would guess maybe 8%
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:09:05
I agree.  I see a 10X rise over the next 5 years.  Mark this post.
@_date: 2016-04-23 22:30:29
I dont know.  I think it has a lot of do with some recent tidbits of good news as well as an increase in use.  The Steam news was big IMO
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:45:55
Stupidest bill ever...
@_date: 2016-04-22 12:02:17
Well They can begin to better regulate the exchangers to cash our bitcoin.  This is where they will regulate things.  If you are fine just holding and using BTC for purchases then no.  When you go to cash out they will try and track you.  
@_date: 2016-04-29 01:20:18
I personally love Coinbase and I don;t care if they have my personal information.  I used Coinbase to accept money for ads I sell for my various online businesses and they have been great.  I report my earnings therefore I don;t care what info they pass on to the government.  I'm just happy to be able to accept payments with virtually no fees and quickly cash out if I so desire.  
@_date: 2016-04-29 01:21:32
Oh and buy the way I had an opportunity to invest in coinbase when they were equity crowdfunding years ago.  A $2,500 investment would have gotten me about 1.10 of a % of the company, which would not be worth approximately $1 million
@_date: 2016-04-05 20:39:29
In come Bitcoin....
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:49:57
Give it 6-8 months and it will pop.  Just watch
@_date: 2016-04-20 13:57:58
If Bitcoin is used, then watch how fast the value climbs
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:10:52
Can't agree more!
@_date: 2016-04-29 13:19:42
This means that our next president will likely own a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:02:16
Nice find!
@_date: 2016-04-29 01:18:43
It was most likely a sort of automatic login via the app.  I'm sure they will straighten it out.  What a pain though!
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:48:56
Agreed It was at $500 not too long ago if I recall correctly.  
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:18:44
Not everyone cares about the anonymity.  
@_date: 2016-04-21 01:46:04
Kinda funny.  They should have just called it Bitcoin.  No trademark issues or anything.
@_date: 2016-04-24 18:04:03
$13 billion really is nothing in the whole scheme of things.  Apple is worth about 40 times this alone.
@_date: 2016-04-17 22:13:26
From a charting perspective, things have been trading extremely tightly.  If the price can hold at 430 and slowing creep to 440 we could break out in my opinion towards $500.  
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:12:36
it sort of has
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:17:21
Awesome idea, but the video is hard to understand.  
@_date: 2016-04-22 11:59:46
Well we are up about 10% over the last 2 months.  Slow and steady I prefer
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:13:48
It is an attack.  They spammed the blockchain to slow things to a crawl.  This is a big reason for the drop.  
It will bounce here very soon.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:13:53
Yes, GDAX will allow you to buy and then sell within minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:45:31
14,500.  It's bouncing hard!
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:10:38
No this is because the Bcash crew are spamming the blockchain with tiny transactions in order to make it appear as if Bitcoin sucks.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:57:05
Thats not true.  Coinbase just doesn't allow for the trading between BCH and BTC
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:02:15
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:08:24
BCH is at 3600 on Kraken and the sell side is stacked.  There is no way this trades at 8500.  Its an imaginary number on conbase.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:45:08
This was a necessary and heathy pull back.  It sets a base for the next leg up from a technical standpoint.  
Such pullbacks are incredibly healthy for the market and allows the weak hands to get out.  That's what happened when it dropped to 11k
@_date: 2017-12-31 12:37:32
I support one eventually, but for now we can wait.  
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:55:33
Don't pay and see if you end up in jail...
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:28:20
I've been here since $300.  Not moving an inch.  Actually I'm happy to see BCH plummet.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:34:29
Of course I don't Have $1.6 million in cash and in Bitcoin but on a smaller scale this seems possible.  Who cares about the IRS as long as I am reporting all my gains correctly?  
If I stick to under 250k at a time, it will be insured on both exchanges, so there goes that risk.  I can have a rotating set of funds and bitcoin so that I always have cash in one exchange and always have bitcoin in the other.
I really don't see any risks...
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:39:00
Very slid support at 13,000, and suer support at 11,250.  It's not going to 9k unless some crazy bad news comes out.   13k is the likely bottom, if not 11,250 will be.  from there expect it to bounce back considerably within days
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:06:42
The $9500 price is not accurate.  Gdax isn;t allowing trades right now.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:13:52
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:02:07
no kidding!
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:54:53
So if I had say 60 BTC in MTGOX, what will I get back?  
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:47:56
Awesome.  We are making it big time :)
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:40:03
$1 million is possible.  That would be a $21 trillion market cap.  $100,000 should be a breeze if mass adoption ocurs
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:13:42
Give it 2-3 Years and I think we easily see $10-20K.  As long as not major hurdles get in the way
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:49:04
I had a chance to buy a 0.1% stake for $2500 when they did their equity crowdfunding campaign years ago.  Wish I did.  Valuation was about $2 million
@_date: 2017-02-13 15:03:36
Thanks Trump....
@_date: 2017-02-11 02:14:17
Buying is very strong.  
@_date: 2017-02-11 13:39:03
I agree with him.  What would be a way to promote change though?
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:13:33
It's nice to stick around in a tight range for a few days to build support.  Next move up takes us to 1200.  Just watch.  Give it another week or two.
@_date: 2017-02-13 15:03:20
Now if only the whole administration doesn't get impeached....
@_date: 2016-03-30 21:52:10
I think that once a scaling procedure is under way the price will rise.  I think slow and steady is the best.  With all the money being invested into the platform it's getting to the point that it's too big to fail (in a good way).
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:49:36
I think we are ready to see things explode over the next 1-3 months
@_date: 2016-03-19 19:09:10
Keep 5-10% of your assets in Bitcoin if you can.  Hold it for 10 years and you are either going to be rich or you will be down 5-10% of your net worth.
@_date: 2016-03-28 20:21:59
Yep, One Bitcoin per $470,000 in Gold or so.  If BTC price made it to just 5% of that we'd all be pretty rich lol.
@_date: 2016-03-28 20:20:08
The more investment that goes into Bitcoin the harder it will be that the currency will falter.  I love seeing stories like these.
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:13:01
This will push the price up 30%, just watch
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:37:56
If Amazon adopted Bitcoin in any way, which I think that they will be doing within the next 12-18 months I see BTC shooting to $800-$900
@_date: 2016-03-23 00:33:56
I would use Coinbase.  About as trustworthy as you can get if you are in the US
@_date: 2016-03-28 20:24:37
Whats ZCash?
@_date: 2017-02-08 20:14:28
An ETF will help those investors who are afraid to buy and store Bitcoin.  We could see a surge to $2k easily...
@_date: 2016-03-30 21:50:39
Hmm seems like this will somewhat compete with Open Bazaar
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:23:43
It's basically trading at the price of an ounce of gold.  Crazy
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:45:36
Ha no way.  They have tens of millions from venture capitalists.  
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:42:57
I would say to dollar cost average.  Break your purchase down in chunks and buy a little bit each day for the next few months.  
@_date: 2016-06-19 13:59:11
The more money investors throw into BTC the more likely for it to succeed long term.  Love hearing these stories about mega funding.
@_date: 2016-06-29 14:12:19
Yeah we will likely have a recession late 2017 or early 2018 in my opinion.  Probably a mild one though IMO
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:13:22
I bet it's headed there in USD as well.  My guess is that it hits $1000 before June is over
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:07:09
I called it in a post a few days ago.  I saw a dip to the high 500's then the rally should continue.  This was a filling of the gap from the way up.  It's healthy and will build a based that's much higher.  I see things leveling off around 630-660 for some time before the next leg up, likely a few days before the halving.  
@_date: 2016-06-01 13:53:41
In comes Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-06-12 14:04:12
Dollar cost averaging is clearly the way to go
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:36:56
This is awesome news for Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:47:38
Yet another nice move to bring more people towards Bitcoin in general
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:17:37
WTF, I'd be pissed.  $10k!
@_date: 2016-06-03 13:24:41
Yep $500 will not be support.  The higher it goes the more Venture capital that comes in too.  The more venture capital the more people thats attracted to Bitcoin.  It's a never-ending cycle
@_date: 2016-06-10 21:35:38
What I don't get is why doesn't a multibillionaire purchase say $2 billion worth of bitcoin.  
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:45:13
Coinbase.com I would recommend
@_date: 2016-06-22 00:32:43
This is likely a healthy pull back to a larger run.  It has dropped in order to fill the gap.  
@_date: 2016-06-20 01:01:48
The fact that billions of dollars have been available to whoever could hack Bitcoin for several years now is a good indication that it's pretty solid.
@_date: 2016-06-20 01:00:17
Regardless of if the ever go bankrupt or not, your coins will still be safe. They aren't using deposited bitcoin for operations.  
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:06:42
It's not just with Bitcoin and Blockchain, but with Artificial intelligence, Neural networks, robotics, 3d printing VR/AR, CRISPR etc.  In 20 years things are going to be completely different for most of us.  Exciting times
@_date: 2016-06-13 20:06:32
Pretty crazy indeed.  That's almost an 80% premium
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:15:02
The bigger this gets the better for Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-06-18 15:02:20
Ultimately it still may turn into a good investment.  With that said, it's stupid to take any such gamble.  Don't invest money you can;t afford to lose.   it is stupid,  it will make you make irrational decisions
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:48:22
Yes I could see this.  Although it may turn some people off
@_date: 2016-06-13 00:42:41
Th great thing about this price rise is that it brings in more venture capital for BTC startups, which makes use cases for BTC even greater, leading to an even larger price surge.  
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:18:58
Any other sources of this information?  
@_date: 2016-06-19 13:58:26
Hacking, theft and stolen merchandise...
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:26:35
I can see the price leveling of a bit to take a breather for a day or so before starting it's next leg up.  I honestly could see this challenging all time highs.  From there, who knows.  Healthy pullbacks though are necessary so that we don't have a mega crash down the line.  
@_date: 2016-06-01 11:57:29
@_date: 2016-06-01 13:54:06
The yield is the rate of inflation. 
@_date: 2016-06-20 01:04:10
The problem with the price continuing to climb is that people don't want to spend it.  
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:24:29
What's your reasoning for not holing it there?  They are insured and their vault is incredibly secure.  Just wondering.
@_date: 2016-06-13 14:28:15
lol it was.  Wonder when we will hit $1000
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:24:41
It was a reverse merger.  Basically the stock was a shell and Mcafee merged his company into and is announcing all these plans.  
@_date: 2016-06-30 20:25:47
I picked up about 5k shares at $2.90.  Will be interested to see how this plays out.  
@_date: 2016-06-26 13:20:35
I guarantee you that the majority of those voting for this bill have not a clue what Bitcoin is or how it works.  I watched legislature pass in Florida for many tech-affiliated laws and these politicians were voting against things that did not understand.  What happens is that no one understands Bitcoin, and one person leading the bill just has to show something negative and they all follow like lemmings.  Many of these politicians fear technological change so vote against it.  This is not how we get ahead as a nation.  We need term limits.  These 85 year old  men are set in their ways.

It's the buying power, not the numeric value that determines strength.  
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:02:56
3.5% or so.  With that said, if Bitcoin Goes to $10k I would have profited over $1 million

It's really unbelievable how much further the marek cap could go.  Consider that there is approximately $8.5 trillion in gold, and gold has no real liquidity.  
@_date: 2017-01-03 21:31:30
As Bitcoin grows in popularity trying to make it illegal would be a major economy killer or at least viewed that way.  
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:18:26
I'm holding both.  Their is more than enough room for safehaven investing

@_date: 2016-06-23 18:05:31
I don;t try to convince anyone to buy Bitcoin.  The currency will move naturally and I don't want to be responsible should another MTGox happen.
@_date: 2016-06-07 21:39:20
A bit nuts I would have to say, but good for us all who are smart enough to invest directly

This could be the killer app we all have been waiting for.  Especially if things continue to progress like they are.

Eventually Russia will roll over and accept Bitcoin.  They know that they have no other choice really.  The more they resist Bitcoin, the more people will use it.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:17:42
I could see a retrace to the high 500's but 400 would be pretty tough.
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:50:38
Long Term, awesome investment, Short term, very risky.  If you can park your money in Bitcoin for 5-10 years I think it's a great play.  If you need the money within a year it's too volatile.
@_date: 2016-06-22 20:49:53
Would be nice if Paypal started selling and buying Bitcoin directly.  
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:53:07
I agree totally.  The vault is about as secure as you can get. For those worried about a MTGox situation, don't.  Coinbase has insurance. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 20:58:17
Give it 2-3 years and Bitcoin will be discuss int he same respect as Gold and Silver.  After years of holding steady/rising in value investors will finally see it as more than just some confusing fake internet money.  
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:31:56
Coinbase's Vault is incredibly secure.  Any movement of funds needs to be confirmed via 2 wemails and a ceelphone code, making it virtually impossible to get hacked.  AT the same time Coinbase is a US-based company that's insured, making an MTGox situation nearly impossible as well.  If you don't mind the government having your information then Coinbase is great.  
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:16:13
Geez, it's really incredible how low the price dropped because of this.  With that said it's a healthy pullback and should help build to higher highs as long as nothing negative comes out of this.
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:30:34
Considering the market cap of all Gold on the planet is $8.5 Trillion, any further connection to Gold can only be good for Bitcoin.  The gold market is 1000 times as large as Bitcoin right now
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:52:22
With all due respect though, if you are an investor, Coinbase is no worse than owning an ETF .  It's more liquid and likely just as safe.  Only half the price to store it.
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:32:18
Yep, confirmed: 
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:59:01
CNBC said multiple hedge funds are looking to get in.  So many people are holding that supply is very low as Demand is only beginning to surge.  Note that One single Hedge fund could afford to buy every bitcoin at the current price.  Now include multiple funds

Bitcoin would need to jump to around $80,000 for Satoshi to become the wealthiest person in the world.

How many of these are for stolen giftcards I wonder...
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:28:13
Would be nice.  One could retire on a bitcoin or two :)
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:00:24
Likely could dip to the 3300-3500 range where it will hit a support, build a nice firm base and head towards 5,000 or even 6,000 by mid september.  Just an opinion of someone who has held since $60
@_date: 2017-01-03 14:56:51
All great news.  The longer Bitcoin remains  and venture capital pours in the harder it will be to supplant by other crypto's.  So much is coming to Bitcoin in 2017 too so this trend should continue for the next 12-18 months for sure.  
@_date: 2016-06-26 13:17:35
I would guess that more liberals are familiar with Bitcoin than are conservatives.  Solely based on age and a more tech-savvy crowd.  With that said, that doesn't mean that liberals can;t make ignorant laws as well regarding Bitcoin.  Oh well, it's NC's loss.  Won't hurt the Bitcoin economy one bit.  
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:06:42
Heck I bought at $60 initially and am still pissed i didn't buy at $3 lol

Short Squeeze?  How were people short?
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:15:22
5 years ago they did an equity crowdfunding campaign.  I could have bought 1/1000th of the equity for a $2750 investment.  I didn't because there were too many forms to fill out.  That $2750 would be valued at $1.6 million right now lol.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 13:34:06
its all propaganda
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:55:11
What's so crazy is that a measly $50 billion reserve would equate the price of Bitcoin skyrocketting likely over $10k.  Now image if if a country got serious...
@_date: 2016-06-23 18:04:11
A total guess... 1 million
@_date: 2017-01-09 15:57:25
You do realize what you are saying right?  $2.4 trillion investing in Bitcoin would mean the price would be at least $175k per coin...
@_date: 2017-01-10 20:29:27
The price has started to consolidate very nicely around $900.  Look for this to continue before the next more up over 1000.  It will be the eventual push over $1150 or so that will make things skyrocket towards 2000 IMO.  I don't see the 2000 mark until the middle of the year however.  
@_date: 2016-06-30 12:51:07
Investing in a lot of things is a gamble though.
@_date: 2016-11-22 14:47:31
Who knows.  In 50 years medicine will look completely different.  We all may be living 300 years.
@_date: 2016-06-16 12:15:19
Yeah, I mean what is driving bitcoin is the same as what's driving Gold.  Gold however is more known as a hedge against inflation.  I'd be buying both

This is an awesome idea if it is sustainable.  
@_date: 2016-12-12 12:46:38
I am excited too, however, this could cause miners to drop out as less transactions will be taking place...
@_date: 2016-06-28 18:04:06
there is only around $8 trillion in gold.  To go back to the Gold standard would increase the price of gold likely by a factor of 30-50.  It's not going to happen nor should it.  It would kill the economy as noone would want to spend their gold and instead hoard it.  
@_date: 2016-12-27 14:39:35
We will easily see $1k, likely prior to Jan 1st, then a pull back perhaps as far back as 875 before the uptrend continuing.

Web browsers do not have networking effects.  The more people who use Bitcoin, the more developers adopt it, the more it is used, the harder it is for other crypto's to take over.

I see $1000 before the new year.  Likely fairly close to the year change.

$1,000 is a strong physological barrier but not really a technical one.

What the hell are you talking about???

Those other sites are partially true.  What I posted was the complete story.  I didn't leave anything out.  The other news stories out there are going on air, because none of the actual court documents were ever released to the public, besides the original complaint when the government thought we were working with the scammers.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:07:42
Because we reply to Trump, we deserve to have our assets forfeited?
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:02:03
I don't care, call me a scumbag, but asset forfeiture is an even scumbaggier thing.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:06:00
Tell me how you would have run the business in a more honorable way.  Everything we did was to protect the members of the sites.  The whole purpose of the sites were to protect people.  There was absolutely no way to filter out which advertisers were scams and which were not.  We tried our best but in the end if we began picking out only the ones WE THOUGHT were legit then our users would have trusted them to the max, and have been taken advantage of if one actually was a scam.  
We did ten times as much as Google or Facebook does in trying to protect our users.  Over 13 years we never once had someone contact us and claim we owed them because they were scammed by an advertiser.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:06:42
Ok buddy, please prove it.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:46:45
There needs to be clear laws regarding advertising online. There are none.  We specifically asked the government what we could do different to be "legal" in their eyes.  They looked at me like I was nuts.  We also asked our attorneys what we could have done differently.  They said "nothing, perhaps put a larger disclaimer".
We were operating within the law.  We did everything to make sure we were.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:40:27
No, when I printed them out I changed numerous characters.  It was in a pattern which I knew I would always remember

They went though our entire lives from 2004 to 2016. I feel pretty confident that I'm ok.  They even collected our garbage every week for a month.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:16:25
You never talk to the media or anyone for that matter during an investigation into yourself.  They could use anything you say against you.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:04:13
They seized our computers.  One email account was logged into.  I assume that they subpoenaed Google for the others.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:12:08
I would say it was incredibly helpful.  Not only to our defense and negotiating, but to our sanity.  They were able to calm our nerves.  
The state doesn't provide an attorney for civil asset cases, only criminal cases.  
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:07:37
We were never charged but if we were charged they would have had no way to seize the bitcoin as we had the paper wallets in a secure location.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:09:32
** Sold banner ads to MLMs among companies from 500+ different niches, while urging users to contact us should anyone find out an ad is a scam.  
There is a MAJOR different between "Promoting" and selling ads.  Promoting means I would have actively suggested people participate in a MLM, HYIP etc.  I NEVER did that.  I usually did the EXACT Opposite.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:26:07
How do you know if you are sell ads to a Ponzi scheme?  It's not as cut and dry as you'd like to make it.  
As for attorneys, it's important to hire people who have experience in the area you are dealing with.  Internet/bitcoin/ecurrencies/advertising/first amendment.  They spent 4 days straight with us traveling to the west coast, Drove 3 hours to our homes 4 times and spent countless hours reading emails to prepare us for a meeting with the government.  You may say it was not worth it, but to us it was.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:05:41
Clearly you have no clue what you are talking about, but whatever.  This topic should be government overreach.  I don't care what you think of me personally, as you don't know me.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:48:45
Wrong, we ran a message board, similar to reddit, in which people talked about making money online and investing.  Like on reddit, MLM promoters posted on the sites.  We also sold ads to MLMs in the past, but just like anything there is no solid line that delineates between a scam and a legit business.  If we started to make that delineation, the members of the site would then trust those we accept over those we dump.  We made the determination that this would cause even more harm and instead plastered warnings all over our sites.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:13:36
We were not required but we also didn't have our attorney on hand to tell us that.  Also I knew there was nothing on the phone incriminating.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:11:22
Does the government want to take on someone who has a few hundred thousands dollars for legal fees, or a corporation who has $200 Billion.  You are 100% correct.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:00:35


I don't consider myself extraordinarily wealthy


We ran a forum (message boards similar to reddit) which talked about hundreds of topics.  One topic was MLM and the purpose of these topics were usually determining whether a company was a scam or not.  


You are absolutely right.  We did sell ads to scammers.  We've sold ads to thousands of companies.  Do you not think that Google, Facebook, Yahoo, Bing, etc etc etc also sell ads to scammers?  The one thing you are missing is that we DID NOT knowingly sell ads to scammers and immediately removed any ads which we found to be scams.  At the same time we encouraged our users o report any ads which may be scams.


You do know that legally, a wives assets are their husband's.  We took the advice of our attorneys and moved assets to our wives, who were both pregnant at the time, so that if the government seized all the cash in our accounts we'd have something to keep them going.  Not to mention the TOP REASON why asset forfeiture is so successful is because the government takes everything, leaving the individual without a means to pay for a defense.


There was absolutely nothing illegal about this.  We did this to prevent our advertisers from getting scammed by this individual.  I'd do it a hundred times more if it meant preventing a scammer from capitalizing off of our work.

I'm just posting here to say 'Hi" to all those people in 2140 looking back 123 years to read this as a form of history lesson... Hello All!!
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:52:23
See above.  Our sites were all Vbulletin forums.  We didnt take money from anyone excpet those who paid for banner advertising (no difference than Google, Facebook, Bing, Yahoo, etc) We sold ads to companies ranging from seo, mlm, stocks, bonds, forex trading, hyips, web promotion and more.  If we EVER found something to be a scam we'd immediately remove the ads and cut all ties with the client. We had numerous warnings to users to beware of scams, and we encouraged users t contact us if they become aware of a scam.  We went ABOVE and BEYOND what nearly 99.9% of websites do, and the purpose of these sites were for people to discuss whether programs and investments were fraudulent or not.  
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:35:38
I remember when the crash happened.  I had a bunch of BTC and a buddy of mine told me how stupid I was for not selling at the peak.  I told him, 'just wait'.  Look who's laughing now!!
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:44:38
We only lost a small amount and legal fees in the end.  The point of the story isn't about my ordeal, but the fact that most people would not have been able to afford 5 figures for an attorney to try and get assets back.  
The govvernment seizes $12 billion in assets a year, primarily from low income individuals.  
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:25:31
I wrote this article after a nightmare ordeal.  Here's the section about Bitcoin, because I know it's a long article.  Please share this story and help me stop Civil Asset Forfeiture!
"Now, however, as the prosecutors were trying to put as much fear as they could into our heads, they were claiming that the act of selling our stocks and moving the funds into new bank accounts under our wives' names, was considered "money laundering" according to them.  It doesn't take a rocket scientist to realize that this legally had no basis for being considered a crime.  The bank accounts were opened under real names in major U.S. banks, but like mentioned previously, when the federal government tells you that you are committing a crime, it really makes you question both reality and your own sanity.
In addition to this scare tactic, the government also told us that they could get us on an additional count of money laundering because we moved our Bitcoin, an online cryptocurrency, from our Coinbase account to a paper wallet. For those unfamiliar with cryptocurrencies, think of Coinbase as Paypal and a paper wallet as cold hard cash.  Being that the Bitcoin was on a paper wallet, this was the only asset that the government had no way of seizing.  When we explained to them that the only reason we moved the Bitcoin was because they issued a subpoena to Coinbase who then forced us to close our account,  they all simply shut their mouths.   It was slightly sickening to watch as they tried to come up with crimes to threaten us with after finally realizing that they had gotten it all wrong.
Fast forward a couple more weeks, and I was working out at the gym one day when our attorneys called and offered up a settlement agreement from federal prosecutors.  The claim from them was that they still wanted practically every dollar that we had earned in the past 13 years.  This was in additional to the incredibly high legal fees that we already had taken on."
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:07:04
The purpose of the article is NOT for sympathy, it's to wake people up about what the government is doing and will continue to do.
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:51:29
We never Promoted MLMs.  We sold banner ads to MLMs among hundreds of other niche markets.  
Promotion entails recommending in exchange for commission.  We NEVER did that.  We did the opposite.  We warned people against such.
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:14:35
They actually seized the wallets, but I encoded it and I only knew how to decode it.  
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:10:32
Adsense was exponentially worse.  Selling ads direct allow us to easily remove them.  Adsense would leave ads up for days after trying to have them removed.

Don't buy GBTC.  Its overpriced.  Once an ETF comes out (Likely within 6-12 months) it GBTC will trade at just a 10% premium to Bitcoin.  Mark my word.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:42:11
When I printed the wallets I changed numerous characters of the key in a pattern that I only knew.  And yes if I was actually charged with a crime I could have i guess been forced to turn over these assets or assets of equal value, but I was not ever charged with a crime.  
@_date: 2017-10-20 11:21:11

@_date: 2018-03-17 13:28:41
Coinbase closed our account because the Government subpoenaed them.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:56:15
Here's the thing.  Once an ETF seems likely GBTC will plummet.  The premium is there only because there are no other options.  Just cash out, buy on Coinbase and transfer to a paper wallet.  Make sure you print out a few copies and put one in a safe deposit box.  Hide the others

Yeah but not all bitcoin is held by US citizens.  In fact the US probably owns about 5-10% of all Bitcoin.  Unless you are going to factor global wealth this stat is meaningless.

It should slowly rise as supply will eventually fall(coins will be lost after the final halving) and demand rise

There is no way this is true.  A company doesn't continue to rake in venture capital if they are nearly bankrupt.  Seems like just a false rumor.  I have reason to beleive that they are doing very well for themselves.

There are thousands of people just holding BTC for a much higher sell price.  Buyers will continue to outnumber sellers for quite some time I feel.  
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:59:11
How about a BitCent?
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:40:33
How can anyone disagree.  Simply supply and demand.  Demand is rising much more rapidly than supply, and eventually supply will be static.  Bitcoin will either totally fail and goto $2 or head to well over $20,000 in the long run.  
@_date: 2016-05-27 13:39:18

This could be huge for Bitcoin if done right.
@_date: 2016-07-29 14:43:47
I love the consolidation actually.  Just like the price consolidated around $400 before the move up, the same thing appears to be happening.  This is important as it pops all bubbles before the next move up.

Is this good or bad?
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:48:11
We need these pullbacks to build a solid base below.  We are building good support, as we prepare to push back over $700 towards $800 once the halving hits.  That's my thoughts at least.
