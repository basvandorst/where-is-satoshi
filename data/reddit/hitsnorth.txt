Can you provide a link to the disclosure where it says that? I just read the disclosure and I dont see that at all. I see reversals on page 19 of their current dislcosure

From the BTCGuild website: 
One block was paid out multiple times due to the script looping, affecting the payout on shifts 13478 - 13487.  It's been a LONG time since this has happened, so for users not aware, here's the breakdown:
A block reward was given out to shifts 13478-13487 multiple times.  As a result, those shifts were credited roughly 10x the amount they should have been.  If you requested a payout, or had an automatic payout trigger during those shifts, you have been paid more than you should have.
Once the payout for those shifts is corrected, your balance will adjust to what it *should* have been.  If this amount is negative, your balance will grow back with each block solve until it's back positive.  The negative balance IS correct, because you were paid more than you earned due to the error.

He got me at branch 0002382 Teller # 00010,  He made the deposit then asked the teller if he could hang out in the lobby.  I saw the coins show up and were available.  The second I released the coins he went back to the teller told her he made a mistake and she just gave him the money back 30 minutes after he made it.

He completely gets it and can explain it better than anyone I have ever heard before.  My 14 year old son learned more during his speech about our system of money and was ranting about fiat currency later that evening!

I have his phone # and other information did he make this deposit at an Oregon Branch?

Im surprised they havent given a reason.  The founder was at the Miami btc conference and seemed pretty optimistic about the future only a month ago.

The site isnt a scam, Im both an investor and a borrower on there for a long time.  Lots of active great people involved.  This guy who posted this was thrown out of our group and this is his retaliation.
