i would like some bitcoin classic if that's the case.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:13:42
i actually imagined something like this, best way of the hacker cleaning the coins will be to setup an onion exchange where he swaps coins with users for the hacked ones, and give the users a high return.
in this case though, the most likely scenario seems to be someone is after loads of bitcoin and is setting up a site to steal them. Using the hype from recent hacks to promote the service and do a mini exit scam.
mentioning this site at all will do more harm than good for anyone in the community. reported to the mods.

hey sorry to hear. i have been through similar times. Just remember, bitcoin isn't going anywhere neither is money. As long as we have more time and health we can always accumulate more.

Maybe people don't use a marketplace to "store" but they use it to work? Such as trading... Shorting Larger amount of coins held in accounts for larger profits. What do you think makes up the Buy and Sell orders on markets or keeps helps your Bitcoin have any value?

They all seem possible, but i can't see how the issue will be implemented in the code... 
I have a feeling the attacker socially engineered the admins to give a duplicate account.
Back when i lost my account access and asked primedice to recover it (and 3-4 weeks of waiting for a response), they finally gave me an account with the same balance if i remember correctly. Maybe, just maybe they did the same with this attacker and he gained access to both accounts while generating a new seed with account A revealing the secret key that is used on account B.
This is all i could come up with, i don't see any other methods unless they had other ways of generating keys such as php mt_rand that is easily predictable once the attacker has data such as PHPSESSIONID.

Yep, They are literally mentioning Satoshi in the paper:


In  this  scenario,
the analyst is interested in determining the identity of an
anonymous programmer. For example, if she has a set of
programmers who she suspects might be Bitcoin’s cre-
ator, Satoshi, and samples of source code from each of
these programmers, she could use the initial versions of
Bitcoin’s source code to try to determine Satoshi’s iden-
tity.  Of course, this assumes that Satoshi did not make
any attempts to obfuscate his or her coding style. Given a
set of probable programmers, this is considered a closed-
world machine learning task with multiple classes where
anonymous  source  code  is  attributed  to  a  programmer.
This is a threat to privacy for open source contributors
who wish to remain anonymous.

2. Do you remember where you sent any crypto currency from? If you used any wallets, do you still have access to them? if so you can provide the deposit address you sent to and sign a message from the address you sent from.

This isn't the only way :)
    
    Hi,
    
    With the functionality added in October, our php_mt_seed PHP mt_rand()
    seed cracker is no longer just a proof-of-concept, but is a tool that
    may actually be useful, such as for penetration testing.  It is now a
    maintained project with its own homepage:
    
    
    
    Changes implemented in October, leading up to version 3.2, include
    addition of AVX2 and Intel MIC (Xeon Phi) support, and more importantly
    support for advanced invocation modes, which allow matching of multiple,
    non-first, and/or inexact mt_rand() outputs to possible seed values.
    
    The revised README file provides php_mt_seed usage examples (both
    trivial and advanced), as well as benchmarks on a variety of systems
    (ranging from quad-core CPU to 16-core server and to Xeon Phi):
    
    
    
    With the new AVX2 support, php_mt_seed searches the full 32-bit seed
    space on a Core i7-4770K CPU in 48 seconds.  On Xeon Phi 5110P, it does
    the same in 7 seconds.  In advanced invocation modes, the running times
    are slightly higher, but are still very acceptable.
    
    For example, let's generate 10 random numbers in the range 0 to 9:
    
    $ php5 -r 'mt_srand(1234567890); for ($i = 0; $i &lt; 10; $i++) { echo mt_rand(0, 9), " "; } echo "
";'
    6 6 4 1 1 2 8 4 5 8
    
    and find the seed(s) based on these 10 numbers using our HPC Village
    machine's CPUs (2x Xeon E5-2670):
    
    [solar php_mt_seed-3.2]$ GOMP_CPU_AFFINITY=0-31 time ./php_mt_seed 6 6 0 9  6 6 0 9  4 4 0 9  1 1 0 9  1 1 0 9  2 2 0 9  8 8 0 9  4 4 0 9  5 5 0 9  8 8 0 9

    We found the correct seed (and there turned out to be only one such
    seed) in under 20 seconds.
    
    What if we did not know the very first mt_rand() output (had only 9
    known values out of 10, in this example)?  Let's specify "0 0 0 0" to
    have php_mt_seed skip the first output:

    seed = 641663289
    Found 2, trying 1073741824 - 1107296255, speed 202975770 seeds per second

    We found 4 extra seeds, and the speed is slightly lower (by the way,
    there's much room for optimization in handling of cases like this -
    maybe later).  The original seed value was found as well.
    
    Other (and possibly more) mt_rand() outputs could be specified and/or
    skipped as well, and/or ranges of possible values could be specified.
    The mt_rand() output range does not have to be 0 to 9, too - any other
    range supported by PHP's mt_rand() is also supported in php_mt_seed.
    
    Enjoy, and please spread the word.
Just knowing the PHPSESSID cookie, the attacker can crack the seed in some cases like that one.

You can either keep it (and hope the value goes up like bitcoins) or trade it on several exchanges or to bitcoin through shapeshift.io
oh and here is the personal link for you to claim it

I lost millions of Doge for a while when Dogecoin forked in the past. Especially not being tech savvy. It's going to be hard on merchants, users and newcommers. It's bad enough as it is people are being put off by bitcoin after not being confident enough to handle their own wallet but this? redownloading the chain and debugging issues that may arise during is going to cause a whole heap of trouble.

Context is here about the attack:


















































Bitdice did fuck up, sure the guy is on a gambling site and thought he got lucky. Maybe not by playing the game he expected but he saw his balance go up and counted it as winnings.
I can't argue about the philosophy, but saying he somehow "stole" the Bitcoin sounds a bit harsh. It is ironic how quickly BTC-E handled the situation, i would be impressed if they did this on more than a few other reported cases but this is certainly out of character for btc-e to swiftly respond. 
I think the OP can somehow get in contact with a legitimate rep of Bitdice sometime soon and settle this, maybe give a majority of the coins to op and keep the rest. Bitdice got lucky and froze the balance but who knows if they have been informed by BTC-e yet or what would have happened if OP would have deposited some place else.
@_date: 2015-06-12 22:59:34
Looking back every day at his old bitcoin transactions where he sold coins for over $9000 each during a price spike to live a short but luxury lifestyle. What if? Should have? all clouding his trail of thoughts. "damn i could have had millions if i kept just a dozen of my bitcoin".

Have you considered what impact a fork will have on the current integrity of Bitcoin?
I'm all up for changes but if we fork in such a scale it's going to take weeks, months or who knows when we will recover? Taking account redownloading blockchains and tons of modifications on services that use bitcoin to adjust to faster confirmations. Let alone the negative impact we will have when newcomers on look at the procedure.

Blockchain.info is ~~completely~~ relatively safe. However, you should never keep more than you could afford to lose in an online wallet. 
Not only because you are relying on someone else to keep your coins safe, but any wallet in a computer or web browser that is used for every day activity have high risk of malware being installed allowing attackers to steal coins.

There are ltc/usd and ltc/btc markets that have large volume. 
Arbitrage opportunities arise between the two order books when sudden price increases on btc/usd markets occur. 
As a result, we see bots and day traders fill up the orders to profit from the arbitrage opportunity, the increase in volume interests traders and it sets off a ripple effect. 
We usually see ltc/btc drop in value while ltc/usd price increase at this point, but as the value of litecoin has dropped significantly to low single digit figures, there are higher profit margins in any % price movement. Also, since there are higher profit margins and more interest plus lower price, It will be the best time for whales to step in and play with the market.
**TLDR; Whales, Arbitrage and low price.**

When funds are withdrawn from exchanges they go out from a hot wallet. Any funds returned to these exchanges hot wallet addresses are not credited into the senders personal account.
So you cannot assume everyone uses a bitcoin client when sending out these coins. And even if they do, that they will be monitoring there client or reusing the wallet.

Most of the community is in for the long term, and real discussion is welcomed here more than this pump and dump bs. Bitcoin price rises are inevitable so no need to hype shit like this, stupid pumps disrupt the market and cause uncertainty.

Just download the repository from  and put it in any offline box, load up bitaddress.org.html on your browser and generate an address by moving your curser.
Save the private key onto a USB onto a piece of paper or your USB, keep the devices offline.
If you can, try to spread your coins into a dozen different wallets, import the private keys one by one on an online device when you need to spend.
You could use any old computer you have for bitaddress.org's repository, or a Raspberry PI. Make sure you never connect this offline computer to the internet for optimum security.

I can't see what other reasons you have to just create tons of hype, what's the point of this? Why show up just now after all this time to spread hype and what you call "buzz"? What line do you have to cross so we can suspect you of attempting to create a pump? &amp;. exploit the current situation with bitcoin.
Anyway, your intentions may have been just to create some trend on twitter, i might be wrong. But most likely you just want to create some hype, with other motives in mind.

This thread is resourceful for carders.

It just looked suspicious that's all.  I guess you are a drop shipping then as the quality of the site didn't look really standard.
Good job with the site, nice to see anything supporting the economy of crypto's.

I just revoked the access before making this post and it certainly had full permissions.

shapeshift has few % margin, you will lose plenty trading back and forth.
Just deposit into a few bitcoin gambling sites/exchanges and withdraw from one to the other.

Something awfully fishy about this site, and not the kind of fishiness you find in pet stores. 
Shipping rates are fixed to the value of the product instead of weight etc,

Because the OP of this reddit topic is a faggot.

Only you know the withdrawal address using this method, especially with multiple cycles. and with any other method the mixer knows your withdrawal address. Plus you might be paying less fee's like this.
Though, if you have issues with compulsiveness, you may start a gambling habit and lose much more than you was willing to lose on fee's by trying one of the gambling sites.
I don't endorse any mixers nor this method so i can't comment. Just a alternative method you can try.

I wish Satoshi just dumps some coins so we can buy cheap ones again.

He probably has millions of $ in Bitcoin right now if he hides his expenditures well. I remember him getting donations when bitcoin was worth few bucks/cents.
