I don't know whether bitcoin meets the definition of a commodity, but it has all the qualities of perfect money (doesn't it? If I'm wrong, please correct me), so I think whether it can technically be called a commodity is irrelevant in this case.

I'm a little confused. I want to get a 12 month subscription, and while I don't want to miss the first issue, I don't have enough to buy the 12 month right now. Should I just buy 1 issue now, and then get the next issues later? (I'm not sure if, by doing that, I risk missing an issue or getting a duplicate).
~~Also, is anyone thinking of buying their subcriptions every 3 months, so they can get as many of these "surprise gifts" as possible?~~ I just realized that doing that would make me an asshole.

Ok, but be advised! Your password must meet these specifications, as defined by Yahoo:
* Passwords are case sensitive.
* The password must be 6-24 characters and may consist of a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, underscores (_), or hyphens (-).
* Passwords can't be all letters or all numbers.
* The password can't be the same as your AT&amp;T Access ID.
* The password can't contain the words "password," "admin," "pa$$w0rd," or other common words.
* The password can't contain obscene language.
&amp; Yahoo, what the fuck? This isn't the 1990s. Setting restrictions on what a password can and cannot contain just narrows the number of passwords that can exist, making them easier to guess. Probability 101. Also, why the hell do they still use security questions? That just means your account can easily be compromised by some asshole that knows you personally.

I can't say I feel the same. They are absolutely not amateurish, and the "Bitcoin Accepted Here" and "We &lt;3 Bitcoin" icons are used by many websites.


Yes, they're from 2010. Yes, Bitcoin has changed since then. No, just because they are from "a time that doesn't exactly represents" Bitcoin, doesn't mean they are all of a sudden obsolete. Good designs will be good designs, no matter how old they are. (Sometimes, very *very* old designs are in need of renewal, but that certainly is not the case with these).


Let's find a more productive way to do so, then, instead of spending time and money trying to replace images that are perfectly fine.
Not trying to attack you at all, I just strongly disagree with what you said about these designs.
EDIT: Just to clarify, I'm speaking solely about these images and what they were purposed for. I'm all for lining up a graphics designer to make some nice looking "bitcoin bills."

If you're on Linux, just start bitcoind (in terminal, type "bitcoind"). In another terminal window, execute "bitcoind dumpprivkey &lt;yourAddress&gt;", and then "bitcoind stop" once you've gotten all of the private keys you need (if you have encrypted your wallet, you must first execute "bitcoind walletpassphrase &lt;yourPassphrase&gt;"). You must have an RPC username and password defined in bitcoin.conf before you can run bitcoind. I'm not sure about doing it in Windows, though (sorry about that).

Use bitfloor. Request a unique deposit amount and print it out. Bring your cash to a Wells Fargo / Chase bank and make a cash deposit to the proper account number. You'll see your USD appear on your bitfloor account within minutes. Make a limit order and define the maximum USD you'd like to pay for your BTC, and once it fills, simply withdraw to your bitcoin address.
EDIT: As with any exchange, do not leave your bitcoins there for long and withdraw them as soon as you can.
EDIT 2: I've bought $500 worth of bitcoins through Bitfloor in the past week and have had no problems at all, in case anyone is feeling wary of using bitfloor in light of the hack.

You can't say that with any certainty unless you've actually talked to website owners and heard "Well, I didn't like it, but it was all that was available."

It's a nice idea, and I too like litecoins, but I don't see why anyone would play for litecoins when they have the option of playing for bitcoins. Even a very nice processor like an i7 2600K @ 4.5GHz running 8 mining threads (~50khash/sec) will only get you about 26 LTC per day. That's about 0.03 BTC per day at current rates. The only way I'd play the litecoin version of this game would be if the payouts weren't too much lower than the bitcoin version. But if the payouts weren't miniscule amounts of litecoins, many people would be unable to play, since most people's CPU's can't generate significant amounts of litecoin in a short period of time.

Turing's relevance aside, I think it looks nice. I do think the fractals in the background could be a bit more subtle, and a gradient mask would do that nicely  (also, the overall opacity of the lines might be lowered a bit).
Also, not that this has anything to do with the design, but how would this bill function as a physical bitcoin bill? (a holographic sticker covering a private key?)
@_date: 2012-07-01 04:17:30
Listen to this man. Anyone interested in a casual mining operation should not consider anything but the jalapenos. Given the current difficulty, their hash rate of 3.5GHash/sec, and the current exchange rate of ~$6.60, they'd pay themselves off in roughly 2 weeks (12-13 days, and I'm not sure what their power consumption is). Of course, the difficulty will skyrocket once this new hardware hits the network, and I'm not too sure how long that would take. It'd be interesting to see if someone had done some calculations to see how much the network hash rate might go up, how long it would take the difficulty to change, and how much it would increase.

The ASIC devices have chips specially designed to be really good at doing SHA256 operations. Litecoin is based on the scrypt algorithm, which is completely different; so no, the ASIC devices cannot be used for litecoin mining. Nonetheless, it's more profitable to mine litecoins right now, especially if the exchange rate goes up from here ($0.03/LTC or ~0.004 BTC/LTC right now).
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:43:36
People gotta get their mining revenue RIGHT AWAY, it seems. The fact that p2pool takes a long time to find blocks (because everyone refuses to touch it) makes payout frequency really low. Just goes to show how much everyone really cares about Bitcoin; it's all about the profit and instant gratification.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:40:56

@_date: 2013-04-07 02:45:45
Could BTC Guild automatically start a P2Pool instance once their hashrate exceeds a certain threshold and defer all new worker connections to that? There would need to be a proxy server set up to handle all connections and decide whether to send them to the main pool daemon or p2pool, and if a worker is deferred to p2pool, the proxy server would have to grab a payout address specifically for the user's pool account. No additional fees would need to be applied after p2pool pays to a specific worker's account, as p2pool allows a fee to be applied by using the "-f" argument when starting p2pool. BTC Guild still makes a profit from fees.
Assuming using a proxy server as described above at all times (even when hashrate is under the threshold) is possible, users should not notice a difference in revenue, even of their shares are being submitted to p2pool. (Although since p2pool is PPLNS, they would see less frequent balance updates; if the user sees that as a drawback, they'll have a reason to switch to a different pool.)

This is true (depending on what one thinks "go through" means); not sure where the disapproval is coming from.
