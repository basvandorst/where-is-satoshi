You know those Marketplace represent like (point my finger in the air..) 95% + of the fiat injection into BTC? Thanks to SR (and Gawker) and many other we took off from the very long $0.12 price point.
@_date: 2016-08-04 10:48:08
You could get all of that and much more during the good old time of SR. And since you're going to ask: You could request custom "services" (next to hitman contracts) which is how human traffic might or might not have happened.

Thank you

Why is it so slow and expensive to perform a transaction in bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-03-03 10:55:15
Like on LinkedIn or Skype or gawker and plenty of other sites.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:00:29
Most of the guys who wanted to buy when the price was super low in fiat just got their account approved/verified.
@_date: 2014-02-16 13:15:43
I've been buying since the maintenance, withdrawing everything immediately in LTC that I convert into BTC on Cryptsy. Today was a good day :)
@_date: 2014-07-25 16:55:59
This is good for Bitcoin

Because young Shibes become BTC boring owners after a while. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:15:25
Is there any "popular" cases of seemingly careful users who have lost their BTC? Any case study? (No gox pls)
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:12:07
I might say yes!
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:04:38
No this is not "huge" as everything in MtGox was severely undervalued this morning. Profit was there but non substantial, specially after fees. No doubts some bots took advantage of the situation tho.

I like anonymity and complete lack of regulation. Only the careless fools get tricked usually. Control your risks and nobody will take more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:38:25
Don't worry I'm prepared, I've been trady gold online for a while; it's more lucrative and less secure than BTC.

The Bitcoin madness is very similar to the gold rush at the beginning of the last century building over night fortune and leaving people behind in despair. I've been trading gold for years and expanded to BTC after some curiosity around the doge coin "movement" it's a very similar environment with the same people having the same role: some Russian scammers, Chinese scheme wonders and US massive fiat injections; all of that sleeping and working in many European wallets/safe.

Looking at the replies here I have no doubt understanding the lack of mass adoption of btc. As long as the most clueless individuals with absolutely no technical knowledge or interest will be victim of those it's not going to happen.

You have not been contacted by this company to perform a professional security audit. Like in 98% of the gambling platforms, the house is right/win in case of technical issues as displayed in their terms and conditions. You have received a nice reward for unique visual glitch you have found, you should have been happy with that. Now you just sound like a desperate gambler and the next thing you have left to raise funds is to give blowjobs on a fast-food parking.

I've done it, buy BTC for cheap $$$ then sell them for LTC and convert again in BTC on another operator.
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:28:24
The only fiat injection into the blockchain is almost 100% Darknet drug trade. Since all the major marketplaces are having troubles, the price is going down.

Happened to me in Germany, lost my laptop case on a drinking night with passport and wallet in it containing the equivalent of $700 and a MacBook Pro and an iPad.
