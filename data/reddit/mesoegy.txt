I really hope you're right, coz i want to get some more cheaper.. the next time i worry about the price will be mid 2020 probably. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:40:31
But it still up 250% from it's price 1 year ago, this is brand new technology not many understand and it's market cap is so small, it can be manipulated by whales.

if you're a long term Hodler like my self, then go with hardware wallet like Trezor, Or cold storage like opensource Electrum.
Never trust an online wallet or an exchange they got hacked and will continue to do .. and most importantly educate yourself on btc as much as u can.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:42:45
totally agreed, inflation is unavoidable tax :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:43:21
yes, the exchange rate was manipulated and controlled for years so the top 1% could get cheap $$ from the banks and use it to import goods and products.
One day we were buying a chines pen worth 1$ for 9EGP.
The next mooring we are buying the same pen for the same 1$ for 19EGP.

well, i'm not too religious myself but i surely will haha :)
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:21:21
Foreign merchants don't accept EGP, they will only take USD or Euro, the sweet government give the USD from it's/our USD reserve to their Businessmen friends so they can import rubbish products.
-Business man buys 1$ from egyptian bank for 9EGP, then goes import stuff from china worth 1$, then sell the stuff for us for 19EGP. that's their circle of stealing from us.

No, i never used any of the big names and i don't trust anyone with my PrivateKeys, i'm my own bank :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:32:37
No sir, you can buy 0.00000001 of btc which cost less than 1EGP, But to Buy 1 gram of gold you need 600EGP, Keep in mind minimum wages here is 67usd/month.
But i agree that for most people getting gold is way way way easier than getting BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:53:56
Don't worry i know about manipulation very well and i got a super steady hands, Beside i'm playing the long game here, so it's all fine by me.
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:10:06
i used many ways through localbitcoins.com or through many online traders who would buy from you or sell to you for a fee, and You may say that 25% of all Egyptian  companies that do web hosting and development also trade in crypto on the side. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:36:35
i don't get it, explain if u may !!
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:35:33
Very good perspective, Good job.
People say it's slow and it can't be used as everyday currency &amp; they forget it's a brand new technology that needs time to grow and mature. don't expect a 10 year old method to beat and replace a thousand year old method instantaneously. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:21:43
i got some USD probably same amount i got on BTC, and got other good assets, But i don't care about monthly price .. i'm in for the long game as a store of value.. which worked pretty pretty good for the last 9 years. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:24:53
through controlling the exchange rate, they control how much 1EGP is worth against USD or any other currency.
Have a look at the charts , 5years+ chart
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:05:06
Does it matter ?, i think not
i always look at the bigger picture and the hard facts not the individuals opinions.
Personally i think we might see 5k or even 4k before the next pull run.

Me personally is smart enough to diversify, in land and house and other assets, But the majority of my people not educated enough and don't make enough to buy apiece of gold or own a house, they can only hold wealth in their fiat, they really have no other choice. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:26:42
I never hold all eggs in one basket, i'm already diversifying my portfolio among many good assets away from fiat, but still bitcoin in my point of view is a pretty good store of value for very good logical reasons away from government control and censorship possibility.
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:54:12
Sir, i'm in this to control my wealth and future, even if some magical thing happened and math failed bitcoin and us, it will be my choice and a risk i was willing to take voluntarily.
on the other hand with fiat, even if i did everything as they say by the book, they would still screw me over and inflate my hard earned money.
Also i'm not naive to put 100% in crypto, i diversify and only risk what i can afford to lose in any single certain investment. 
Bitcoin, is soo appealing to me because it has math and logic behind it and because it can't be censored or taken away from me.
Sir, i live in a country that it's very possible to be scammed for your money, land, gold and even your freedom :( 
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:07:53
Totally agree, right now i'm in my late 20's .. and i use Bitcoin to store my extra money for future needs, i also try to use it when ever i can just to support the community.
I will hodl for many years to come and soo willing to stick with my hopes for long time. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:27:53
that will be interesting :)
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:35:06
Yes they are corrupt and they'll say whatever the men who pays their salaries orders them to say. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:26:05
all paper money is shit money, But some are worse than others, here we consider US Dollars as save heaven like gold but easier to sell, By the way minim wage in Egypt is 67 usd/MONTH.
@_date: 2018-06-22 21:21:37
People can't do that regularly for many reasons like if you got caught with USD u could be jailed, and access to stock market in a developing country only reserved for the top most wealthy 5%.
i live in a country that it's very possible to be scammed for your money, land, gold and even your freedom :( 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:54:48
Bitcoin as designed can't be used as everyday currency we know from the beginning it's slow and have high txs fees, so is moving gold. 
There will be other solutions for this as i mentioned in layer2 and layer3 . But i REALLY can't understand your point of view calling it a failed technology.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:18:41
Thank you for sharing yours too brother, The banks interest rate here in egypt was 20% last year, today it's around 15.5% .. making it insane for anyone to get a loan. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:39:50
i disagree. Bitcoin isn't supposed to be everyday currency .. although it could be with things like lighting network and many innovations to come. it is supposed to be store of value like gold, and it gets its value from it's unique characteristics and users acceptance. 
We will agree on one point here which is no one should invest everything in one thing and only get involved if you understand it enough. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:03:43
I try to do within my circle, you know what the government officials said last December when news about crypto was loud, finance officials said it's a scam and the religious officials said it's haram as in it's a sin that god will punish u for getting into it :))
@_date: 2018-06-22 16:23:30
No i didn't say that, every one will treat it according to his experience, how well he understands the technology and also on what he expect to get. 
Personally, i see btc is better than both USD &amp; EGP for a long term store of value, yet i'm not 100% in it. i also invest other good offline assets.
Investing 100% in only one thing is very naive as i see it.
@_date: 2018-06-22 14:15:38
I know it's a risk i'm willing to take, because i tried the alternative and i didn't like it very much .. Regarding the carbon thing .. i too believe in the future of renewable and sustainable power .. so fingers crossed here :) 
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:11:19
No sir, i don't need it as every day currency. but i need it as a store of value as a better version of gold.
When i get involved i knew very well no single store in my whole country is accepting BTC and i don't expect there will be for a few years. Yet BTC and fiat and gold and all other means of value exchanging can live together as i see it.
You are a good smart man for not keeping your money in cash, but i think your are wrong on calling BTC a failed technology. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 12:55:08
it won't be easy, but we have no choice but to push back and try to regain our destiny .. also a year or two or even 10 is nothing compared to the history of nations .. be more optimistic brother.
