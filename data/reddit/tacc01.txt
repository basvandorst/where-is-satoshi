I recently opened up an account on Iconomi just for that. Im ok with the fees percentage, plus all the hard work is done by the DAA managers.

I was mining bitcoin when I could make 2 per day with GPUs. I'm still poor. Some of us are just too stupid to get rich, even when at the right place, at the right time.

Bitstamp for EU/world. Coinbase/Gdax for US. Binance for shitcoins, I guess.

Win in a transparent yet private money transfer over the internet with no central entity and no way to freeze your account, 24/7? Crypto currencies are already winning and are used as expected - btc/xmr was adopted by people who needed it the most - cyber criminals. The whole thing needs more polish, but we’re already living in the future, bois! Yay.

I primarily believe in idea of decentralized, anonymous peer to peer exchange of founds. I can do this with plenty of other coins. I particuraly love monero. So yeah, idea will survive imho, but how it will be named at the end - noone knows.

There are gazillion ways to anonimize your bitcoin ‘kreh shapesift kreh’ and sell it for cash money. You dont need exchange to sell. When u have cash in hand, u still need to think like a criminal. No lambos and shit like that.

Unpopular opinion: it may not be polished yet, but crypto works. See dark markets. Thats what we really wanted in 2009, being rich was a side quest.
