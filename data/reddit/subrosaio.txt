CSP mitigates XSS attacks:


We can't do anything about browser exploits, however if the attacker is able to break out of your browser sandbox then any other program you run on your computer may be at risk.

We've implemented authentication in a similar way to OTR. When the conversation keys are exchanged, you're able to verify that there is no MITM attack performed by communicating the hash (of both your public keys) via another communication medium (eg over the phone).
This process exchanges a long term key, and as such you only need to verify the public key authenticacy once.

Use Bitcoin when you come across it! This is how we'll get NCR to integrate Bitcoin for everyone :)

IRC with SSL is not end to end encryption. The IRC network is still able to eavesdrop.

Or you could tip open source projects that accept Bitcoin donations :)

Hi, with the Content Security Policy header the browser can be set to only execute whitelisted code - such as 'only code from localhost'. We provide the proper headers in our [source page](
We are interested in any attack vectors against a locally hosted app, with the CSP header passed.

Hi socium,
I think you're more referring to remotely-executed code instead of that it is being executed in a browser. With Content Security Policy headers, inline code is blocked from executing (removing code injection and XSS attacks), and you can download the source and host it locally. With CSP, your browser will enforce that no outside code is ever executed. 
We're interested if you can find any threats for a locally hosted client with the proper CSP headers sent. Web application security has advanced quite rapidly (such as preloaded HSTS lists - Subrosa's HSTS status is hardcoded into Firefox and Chrome) and we think it's dismissive to categorize *all* web app offerings as weak, as while that is often the case we don't see it as being relevant to Subrosa.

Yes, eventually :) Our protocol is not set in stone yet, and we have plenty of features not yet implemented.
Message confidentality or integrity (we use AES-GCM) does not depend on the server/backend whatsoever :)

Yes - mobile apps are planned, using Phonegap and Cordova :)
The nature of Javascript and WebRTC enables Subrosa to share most of the codebase across mobile, web and desktop too.
