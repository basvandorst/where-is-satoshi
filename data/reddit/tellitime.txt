People are just realizing holding Bitcoin now gives you free Bitcoin cash. Most cautious people had already reduced thier holdings before now. Since learning exchanges are supporting cash they are adding to thier holdings the same time a lot of people are moving coins to offline wallets.

All the exchanges halted at some point I believe. The quicker they resume the better the exchange.

You need to give me topic and you can withhold payment if you don't think it's funny but then you haven't met your goal. It may actually already be too late but who knows. Full disclosure, I'm an engineer, I only chose poetry because it's easy to post and even the worst crap has someone who likes it. The price is fine though.

Yep, wait for a big drop, at least 20% below the high.

I'll send you a poem for .1 bch. Let me know what topic and where to send it, I'll send you the bch address. Quality most definitely not assured but it may be a little funny.

Gold is more like Ethereum. The production rate changes based on value, it has different uses and can be used in things other than storing value. Bitcoin is more like a currency, only worth what people thinks it is. Both are close to what we already use though.

If currency crashes crypto coins will too. All assets plummit in a downturn and coins are an asset now. Fewer people with money, fewer people buying things, lower prices ensue.

Even better for marijuana sales in the US.

Only if it plummit afterwards. If it rises from here it's a healthy pullback or consolidation.
