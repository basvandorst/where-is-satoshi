Great cartoon!  The large institutions standing on the wrong end of the plank - the Fed in particular - need to realize that the more they try to deny the legitimacy of cryptocurrency, the more they inadvertently reinforce why it exists in the first place.
Trust in official institutions like government, and the media are at an all-time low, all over the world. That's why people want decentralized alternatives.
The more that top officials in the public and private sectors keep calling bitcoin a fad (or worse), the more they signal that they don't get it.
No one knows for sure whether any specific currency will succeed or fail long-term, but I do know that crypto isn’t going away. The federal government needs to recognize this too.

Minister99, you've hit on the single and only REAL issue facing Bitcoin: 
Government attack.
Fortunately there's a way to stop governments from crushing Bitcoin: It's by use of a simple app that everyone has on their phone that converts dollars into crypto WITHOUT a bank being aware that is what the transaction is for.
The app is basically a decentralized crypto-exchange that is NOT ON A CENTRALIZED DOMAIN NAME, but is connected to a decentralized transaction blockchain. 
This app is on everyone's phone and connects to every other copy of the app via the blockchain. It automatically uses smart contracts to verify receipt of fiat payment (e.g. Dollars) being exchanged for Bitcoin by accessing the verification data from a banking app on the phone, then releases the Bitcoin it is holding in escrow to the buyer.
It is global just like bitcoin, is beyond the reach of governments and no bank can track the exchange taking place either, because the app separates the Bitcoin and Fiat aspects of that transaction, so it always looks like someone is simply sending funds via their bank to another person with no mention of Bitcoin anywhere. 
It cannot be attacked, corrupted, stomped on or stopped.

How much money is invested in Bitcoin so far? Hardly any. 
Here's the real numbers waiting to join the party: Global institutional pension fund assets in 22 major markets stood at US$36.4 trillion at year end 2016, amounting to 62% of global GDP.   
That is a staggeringly large amount of money.
But here's the thing... pension funds are big cumbersome dumb money. And they're all allocated in equally dumb indexes, passive strategies, and bonds. But all of a sudden, Joe Sixpack has all his savings in there and is getting pimples he hasn't had since he was a teenager because of the low returns and lack of security. 
So now he's seriously looking at Bitcoin.  Look for a money tsunami into BTC at some point in the next 6 months.

When this new 'risk warning' by the Reserve Bank of India has absolutely no effect, and Indians rush to buy even more Bitcoin, what pretext will they use next to make Bitcoin illegal? Wait for it, wait for it ... aaaaaand "It's used for money laundering." (Stifles laugh of derision.)
The Indian government is very slow to react, like a deer frozen in a truck's headlights, because Indians seem to be loving virtual currencies, as seen by the huge demand for Bitcoin at Indian exchanges and substantial premium at which Bitcoin trades in India.

Interesting, and agree entirely there's no guarantee. 
Re "As long as the former group can outtrade the latter, the price will stay high." People are panicky and flighty yes, (FUD) but they also suffer equally as much from FOMO - fear of missing out on their dreams of riches beyond imagination. It's the same "wall of worry" that drives the stock market. That's how most people are - emotional. And considering most people by far are not yet in the market, I'll bet on FOMO.

It's becoming simply embarrassing now when a government or banker blurts: "Bitcoin needs to be stopped, because it's **tulip mania,** and is used for drug dealing, tax dodging, money laundering and terrorism".  
This false narrative is simply to set up a pretext for attacking it because they fear quite rightly that the public might prefer it over their failing fiat currencies. 
Yes, Bitcoin was once used for buying drugs on the website 'Silk Road', but not any more. 99% of bitcoin is now traded by mainstream speculators and investors.
Here's what the Winklevoss twins had to say about this: 
"When Silk Road got busted, the price of bitcoin appreciated considerably and transaction volume did not decrease. In fact the number of transactions on the blockchain only increased from that point forward. **So this idea that bitcoin is powered by dark market or money launderers is simply false."**  
The criminal currency of choice is actually the US dollar bill, and the dark trade it powers runs into $ trillions.  We're still waiting for bankers to blurt that it should be stopped.  But I'm not holding my breath.

I don't know why anyone would worry about the price of Bitcoin dropping.  Every time there is a big dip, (absolute maximum 30% on average) it relentlessly claws its way back up again. The current dip is less than 25%, so it's not even the biggest drop. 
The reason the price goes back up is that the great mass of the people in the world haven't joined the party, and because the market is driven in large part by adoption, news like the NSYE attracts attention, so more people discover Bitcoin and decide to join the party.

Sorry, the music won't stop.
Bitcoin has had a slowly increasing number of users, but has suddenly reached a tipping point and exploded. It is now a viral phenomenon as ordinary people who have bought some spread the word through peer to peer networks.  
The tulip trade was quite different, and at a very high level limited to a set of increasingly greedy traders who brought about the 'mania' by selling it back and forth. The rest of the economy (like 99%) was largely unaffected.
There's no question however that people ARE getting into Bitcoin through fear of missing out on a speculative investment. It's not about swapping over to a useful currency - yet. That will begin to happen as it matures.

I don't know why anyone would worry about the price of Bitcoin dropping. Every time there is a big dip, which maxes out at 30% on average, it relentlessly claws its way back up again. The current dip is below 25%, so it's not even the biggest drop.
It's completely different to a stock market price crash where everyone who was ever going to buy piles in and the price screams up. Then it crashes. This isn't the case with Bitcoin at all.  The price goes back up after each dip because the huge mass of potential buyers in the world haven't yet joined the party, in particular the large institutions. Most people also know nothing about Bitcoin, and because the market is driven in large part by ADOPTION, news like the NSYE attracts a great deal of attention causing more people to discover Bitcoin and buy.

$20,000? More like $25K.  
But why is it rocketing? I found this genius explanation in another thread:  "Bitcoin is much better described as a virus than a bubble. It is a virus on the global capital metastructure. It will continue to consume capital in every form, and will not stop eating until it is ubiquitous.
The idea that it is a bubble that will burst presupposes that it will soon run out of fuel to continue growing. The amount of fuel available in the world capital markets is immense. The bitcoin growth curve mirrors the standard chart of virus expansion. Expect exponential growth for at least the next 3 years. This thing is hungry and it is loose in the world's largest perti dish. The host has no natural immunity as this virus is of a totally unknown form. "

Good point, but the central thing people lose sight of is that Bitcoin protects your money from bank collapse and government theft. This is of incalculable value to the average citizen who previously had no way to guarantee to keep their money safe.
Think about it: None of the following horror stories threaten Bitcoin.
1. Government currency loses value every day because of money printing, but Bitcoin INCREASES in value. (Yes its price ramps up and down, but because supply is permanently limited it will increase overall.)
2. Governments can confiscate your cash, gold, shares or property, but never your Bitcoin. Even if they demand you hand over your private keys, you can't because you lost them in that 'unfortunate boating accident' last year. :)
3. Your Bitcoin cannot be stolen by banks when they try to 'bail in' (steal) your deposits. It is completely beyond their clutches.
Get some Bitcoin. It is incredibly safe.

I actually got the point.  
I just don't think a massive crash is coming, there is nothing to indicate that. In fact I think the opposite is the case. Here's some of the reasoning: 
The Bitcoin market is really tiny, a barely visible minnow when compared with stocks, bonds and forex.  There's also enormous potential adoption that's preparing to enter the market.  For example, institutional flows into Bitcoin haven't even started yet, but they are coming. They're also in no rush, and instead are moving slowly to be sure they have their own infrastructure in place, for example ensuring they stay within their KYC, AML rules, and have custodial policies in place.  They are coming into the market during the next 12 months.  That sounds like a very long time to wait, but that's how long it takes them.  Just keep watching and you'll see them appear, one by one.  
Overall, I'm not a blind bull, I just think there are forces at work that will cause Bitcoin to go a great deal higher.

Agree. Bitcoin isn't in a bubble, because hardly anyone is 'IN' yet. 
But once the herd arrives, it will accelerate and the rise into the price stratosphere will really begin.  In future, when the trading charts are viewed over a longer period, the current price spike will probably look like a blip.   
Stock market traders get it completely wrong when they suggest Bitcoin is in a bubble, or is 'Tulip Mania'. They fail to see that all the potential stock traders are already in the market. But with Bitcoin the great mass of investors hasn't even arrived yet. 
Furthermore, Bitcoin isn't just another stock. It's a disruptive revolution as important as the internet itself. The internet came for the music industry, then it came for the publishing industry, now it's coming for the banking system.

Completely honest article and moreover, totally unbiased. The point being made is that when people want to learn about Bitcoin and blockchain they look for independent thought leaders.   
I haven't made my mind up yet about BCash, but the fact that its called 'Bitcoin cash' throws up a massive warning flag.  Is the new BCash coin unable to stand on it's own two feet without have to piggy back on the brand name of the market leader?
The bottom line is that when statements that trash Bitcoin are made by commentators who claim to be independent but in fact have vested financial interests in BCash, they are being outright dishonest and misleading.

Bitcoin is neither Tulip mania , nor is it a bubble.
In 2013, they called bitcoin drug money. In 2017, they called it a bubble. It’s not in a bubble. We're on the path of digitizing the world. We are seeing the final phase of the Post-Industrial Revolution which started in the 1960s-1990s with the invention of the microprocessor through to the expansion of the internet.
Bitcoin is not just money. It’s the invention of an internet-native digital scarcity. And with that breakthrough, software will eat the financial world.

The price of Bitcoin might have dropped today, but the overall trend will continue upwards because of the accelerating ADOPTION rate.
Consider the fax machine - which is utterly useless if you are the only one who has one. The value increases exponentially as other people get fax machines. This is also true for social networks.

It doesn't really matter what governments do, Cryptocurrencies will - one way or another - blow them away.
Once cryptocurrency exchanges are decentralized in the same way crypto already is, (i.e. everyone becomes an exchange) there's nothing governments will be able to do to stop it. The exchanges are the last centralized neck on which they can stomp.
Governments may even screech "Cryptocurrency will not be recognized as a method of payment" or deem it illegal. But the fact is they are powerless to stop it if they can't actually SEE the activity.
This is exactly what crypto was invented for - to make money decentralized, untrackable so it is directly usable by the people, without a centralized entity that extracts fees, bails in bank deposits and slaps on taxes.

Crypto will be unstoppable by governments and banks like Dimon's, but only if one problem is solved first: 
**How to change dollars into cryptocurrency without the banks or governments noticing?** 
Solve that and it's game over for banks and governments.
**Here's how it can be done:** 
At the moment the exchanges are centralized systems that can be easily stomped on by governments. The solution is to make them INVISIBLE to governments by decentralizing them in the same way the currency itself is decentralized, by making everyone a peer-to-peer exchange. This can be achieved by freely distributed software that accesses a **decentralized blockchain exchange.** (It works the same way as e-wallets do now with no centralized entity in control.) 
**How it works:** 
The software shows all the bitcoin on offer, and also enables buyers and sellers to connect.
You pick a Bitcoin owner with Bitcoin to sell. With a click, you agree on a price. To make the actual payment invisible to banks, and protect both buyer and seller, an escrow service is used. You send the funds to the escrow service, but CRUCIALLY, **nothing in that transfer identifies it as a cryptocurrency purchase.** All the escrow service knows is that when you give them them go ahead, they must release the funds to another person's bank account. Nothing more.
**1.** When the funds hit escrow, the escrow notifies the seller it has the money. (But there's no mention it's for a crypto purchase.)
**2.** The seller releases the cryptocurrency to the buyer using their eWallet.
**3.** The escrow then releases the money to the seller.
No mention of cryptocurrency anywhere.
No centralized entity in control.
No neck for a government boot to be pressed on.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:57:22

This is verging on comical. I'm not sure how the Russians can say they plan to "legalize" cryptocurrencies and keep a straight face. .
Satoshi Nakamoto invented crypto with 3 features that are non-negotiable in order for it to work:
(1) It's anonymous. (Well... a lot more than a check or bank transfer is anyway.)
(2) It enables instant, peer-to-peer transfers between people, no matter where they are in the world, without being slowed down by a centralized 'authorization' system that clips the ticket. 
(3) It has a decentralized ledger (the blockchain) that can't be manipulated by banks or governments, because it's 'everywhere', so it can't be taxed, tracked or attacked.
But these are the very three things the Russian Ministry wants to overturn. 
(1) They want it de-anonymized. 
(2) They don't want crypto to be exchanged peer to peer, they want it to go through a centralized system they control. 
(3) They want a centralized ledger.
Exactly what cryptocurrency is designed NOT to be!!
In other words, they plan to hobble it and reduce it to being just a part of the current broken money system.This completely defeats the purpose of crypotcurrencies. But of course, the Russians already know this.

Of course it's not a "browser". That's simply a metaphor for a new and badly needed needed technology.  That's why it is in inverted commas.

This article is highly articulate but is blind to the real problem facing cryptocurrencies: The crypto exchanges are all centralized and can be shut down by governments. 
The moment a system is created that enables people to convert fait currency into crypto without the governments or banks noticing is the day Bitcoin will be off to the races.  We need system that completely separates the bitcoin part of the transaction from the money part so the banks don't know WHY you are sending someone money. 
Maybe I'll start with Paypal. They have no idea why I send money to someone else  :)
Someone far cleverer than me will create this. 
Who are you?  Where are you? Please begin. You will save us all!

That's correct.

I think Jamie Dimon knows exactly what Bitcoin is going to do.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:08:57
But you had to explain it to him in detail. So this is not even remotely mainstream. In nay case most people simple won't take the time to absorb something like your clever friend.

Still talking about eWallets and public / private keys etc. Mainstream will glaze over even at this.
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:10:17
Banks in control? Nope. They'll all have gone broke. Bitcoin - once you have your money safely out of fiat - will be the only currency you'll need to use. No reason to convert it back to old dying money.  
And the day is not far off when it will be used to pay for most everyday things.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:05:33
No it isn't.  The public has no clue how it all works.
@_date: 2017-09-28 05:25:54
Bohendo. Can you explain how a smart contract might work here. (I'm sure you're right, I'm just not clued in.)  Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:31:21
No-one will deposit their crypto with a bank. They are exactly what crypto is designed to make redundant.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:13:27
Looks pretty good, but it is still calling the system a wallet.  It isn't. The misnamed eWallet is much more like a bank login interface. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:02:55
Interesting thought. More...?

GET READY TO LAUGH: Putin says **Crypto poses "serious risks"**. Yes it does Mr Putin, to fiat currencies.
Government officials can never say it is a threat to fiat currency because that gives crypto HUGE legitimacy, so they spread BITFUD instead. (Fear and Uncertainty about Bitcoin.)
Here's some of the more ludicrious BITFUD lies: 
**1.** Crypto has “serious risks” because it is unregulated (sorry, it is regulated, the blockchain ensures this) 
**2.** It can be used for money laundering (not any more, unlike banks who launder federal reserve money every day) 
**3.** Used for tax evasion (Nope, or only if it's rapacious) 
**4.** Used for fraud (No it isn't, unlike Like JP Morgan who was just fined several billion dollars for exactly that), 
**5.** Used for arms trafficking (Hardly at all, unlike the US government who does it massively with dollars). 
**6.** It is a pyramid scheme (No it isn't, but the Federal Reserve is)  
**7.** It's like the Dutch Tulip mania (No it isn't, but the current US stock market is.)  
Of course it's all a load of total BOLLOCKS. 
They must realize that everyone knows they are lying.  
But what else can they do?  
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:40:56
Ha ha!  Exactly.
@_date: 2017-09-24 11:21:45
Perhaps you're right.
@_date: 2017-10-05 22:00:38
The reason banks want to stop cryptocurrency is the threat it represents to fiat currency. 
But they can't say this because that would be admitting crypto has real power. Instead they trot out the completely worn out lie that Bitcoin is used for Criminal activity, Money laundering and Terrorism. 
Think about it.

Don't be fooled:  
*“We must make an organized market out of the black market.”* - Anton Siluanov, Russian Minister of Finance
This is so transparent it's laughable. What Mr Siluanov really plans is to **centralize** crypto-currencies so transactions are all channelled through a centralized entity that gets in between the two parties doing the transaction. EXACTLY what cryptocurrencies are designed NOT to be.
He wants to make crypto controllable, printable, taxable and trackable by the Russian government, just like the Ruble which of course completely defeats the purpose of currencies like Bitcoin which are specifically designed to be peer to peer, with NO third party involved. i.e decentralized and not controlled by anyone.

Thank you!  Virtually all the arguments here are cosmetic and by minds stuck in the 20th century. 
We need to protect ourselves from rapacious banks and governments and this is the path... but it needs to be made EASY. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:22:03
Yes they will. Your 'P &amp; P keys ' are basically exactly the same as a user name and password but with fancy names.  We all keep those, except in this case there won't be a bank to block your access when they go broke. This is not your grandma's world.
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:55:51
The real, barely disguised reason banks want to stop cryptocurrency is the threat it represents to fiat currency. But they can't outright say this because that would be admitting crypto has real power. Instead they trot out the completely worn out lie that Bitcoin is used for Criminal activity, Money laundering and Terrorism.
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:45:15
That is a minor technical issue that will be solved. Technology and cryptography will not stay stuck at the point it is in right now Sept 2017.  
Decentralization will give people a chance to protect their money. 
But centralization will ensure that sometime within the next 5-7 years you will lose it all when the banks go broke and bail in your funds.  (It's happened in Cyprus already. All the depositors had virtually all their money ~~stolen~~ "bailed-in" to save the bank.)
And contrary to naiive popular knowledge, the governments and the banks will not insure you for that.  Your money will be there one day and .... it's gone
@_date: 2017-09-24 10:18:53
No, traditional bank deposits are not protected in a major downturn, that's a fantasy.  
You are in fact an unsecured loaner to the bank. Most banks around the world are insolvent, and are putting in place 'bail-in' provisions so they can steal your deposits to 'save the bank' when it goes belly up. (Which is almost certainly going to happen sometime in the next 5 years.)
More to the point, I'm much more interested in hearing ways in which this can be made to work, not a non-contributing response saying why it won't.  Where are your ideas?
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:41:42

@_date: 2017-10-08 23:41:19
Privacy? Absolutely. 
It is the key to the future of crypto.
But this isn't the privacy your grandma knows. It's about keeping your wealth private from government snooping, tracking, taxing and eventually confiscating through bank bail ins! 
The only thing really standing in the way of Bitcoin going mainstream is that crypto-exchanges are all **centralized,** and non-private, enabling governments to shut them down. 
The solution is to **decentralize** exchanges so that everyone has a free downloadable app on their phone that is a crypto exchange.  The ENTIRE point is that the app does not need a bank account otherwise it would be no better than the exchanges:  
The secret to this app lies in separation: The app just does the Bitcoin transfer part, while the fiat currency part is done independently through banks without specifically identifying it's for a Bitcoin purchase. The banks therefore won't be able to see the money is used to purchase Bitcoin. 
Equally importantly, the app acts as a digital escrow and ensures both parties complete the transaction.  (For the techies reading this, the app will be based on ‘atomic swaps’ brought across into the 'fiat to crypto' environment.)  It's not easy to solve this, but minds far cleverer than mine will certainly achieve it. 
The moment this app is created anyone can free themselves of governments and banks. It will enable anyone to escape the inevitable, approaching government action of confiscating citizens’ wealth.
Naturally the incumbent banks and governments will do anything to stop this. The challenge they face is they cannot admit that crypto currency is a threat to their dominance, because that would immediately give it massive legitimacy. 
Instead they are attacking it on two fronts:
1. The  FIRST thing they are doing is spreading BITFUD untruths (spread Fear Uncertainty and Doubt about Bitcoin) on an almost daily basis in the mainstream media: 
(i.) They claim "Crypto has no regulatory framework, so it unsafe!" 
UNTRUE. This is the ENTIRE point of blockchain: It is specifically designed to be self-regulating and kill fraud, because the common ledger is decentralized and cannot be corrupted. (Unlike the banks).
(ii.) They claim that Bitcoin is used for laundering the proceeds of crime, drug dealing, funding terrorism. 
UNTRUE. Bitcoin isn't used for that. It was once, but no longer. Now it's a mass investment vehicle with 99% "straight money" going into it.
2. The SECOND thing governments are doing is attempting to disrupt crypto currencies at a technical level. We are already seeing this with Segwit2x, and many other attempts. Even the term BTC which stands for ‘bitcoin’ is being hijacked to try to disguise these attempts to bring centralization to crypto, which of course completely defeats the reason for its existence.
An example of how governments intend to take over bitcoin by the ‘technical’ back door is 'Segwit2x' that enables more centralized control. The governments will then have a neck on which to place a boot. i.e. force these centers to comply and make all transactions decrypted and run through a government controlled data center. 
As long as people stick to the original fully **DECENTRALIZED** crypto-currencies such as the original Bitcoin, they will be safe. It would pay to extract your Bitcoin from the system for a while and keep it on paper to avoid any attempts to electronically ‘force convert it’ into centralized currency.
**The bottom line:** 
All of the above is opinion only, and in fact the "Lightning Network" may well be the solution. So I hope that what I have noted above is "old news" and that work to solve these issues has been underway long since.

I'm suspicious. What is the Japanese government's hidden agenda?
The Japanese finance minister is not naive and doesn't smoke funny cigarettes as far as I know, so he must be aware that cryptocurrencies pose an huge existential threat to the dominance of the Dollar and the Yen. And yet... they are going to allow crypto to flourish? Perhaps once the the exchanges are operating and fully invested with millions of clients so it's too late for them to turn back, the government will legislate for exchange client tracking and then the centralization of every peer-to-peer transaction. Let's watch this space very closely.
