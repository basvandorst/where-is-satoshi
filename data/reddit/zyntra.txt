what hugevagina2 is talking about is a fork-split. Much like Linux has different 'flavors'. Different directions taken by developers. What you are asking is a stock split, which does not apply to bitcoin as you can get fractions of a bitcoin. Currently the lowest unit is a satoshi (8 decimals behind), but this can be divided even further in the future if need be.

My guess would be they store it like we did before commercial hardware wallets became a thing (pre-2014?). makes some good points already. Let me give my view on it.
It all starts with a private key. These are generated in an air-gapped environment. That is a clean computer that has never had any connection to anything ever. The key is generated without any signals in the air. No nearby wifi, no bluetooth, no other rays, waves or frequencies. This key is then cut into 2 or 3 pieces, and each part is stored on multiple mediums. A clean usb, a piece of paper, engraved in a metal of sorts, carved in wood, a cd, a dvd, encoded in a multitude of other ways. Each version of this is then sealed in a way that is fireproof, emp-proof, radiation-proof, you name it. Then each of these items are stored in various locations in the world. Vaults, safes, buried, hidden. 
Now this is the extremely paranoid way of doing it. And it all depends on how often you need access to the coins. I remember reading for example that the Winklevoss twins have a version of this. They cut the private key in 2, and each twin keeps his halve in multiple bank vaults across the world.
If you do need access to the deep-cold-stored funds on a somewhat regular basis, say once a year, you are most likely not just using the private key, but open-source wallet software that allows you to sign a transaction offline, transport said signed transaction to an online system and broadcast it from there. This is what we did using Electrum for example. And despite having a handy hardware wallet available now I still advise people to use this method for their most precious stacks. It gives maximum control, but some know-how is required.

The issue for merchants right now is not how to accept bitcoin. Any wallet set up by the merchant can be used to accept it, no PoS is really needed (although you can use one). Some comments here already explain that. The issue would be the accounting aspect of it. What I can say on the subject is this: you'll have to manually do the accounting. You use your local currency as 'Unit of account'. But treat the settlement of the payment as a 'foreign currency'. Much like you would if you'd accept USD for your Canadian business. When doing the books at the end of the month, the value of USD/CAD may have changed a little. You could have made a profit or a loss on this conversion. This profit or loss is then added to the books. At least this is how its done in my country, which is not Canada.
I would suggest looking into the steps you'd have to take if you wanted to accept any foreign currency, and apply those same steps to Bitcoin payments. Given that the blockchain is public, this should not impose any problems in the rare case of some inspection or inquiry of sorts. No fraud is happening and you can prove it.
Crypto isn't exactly widespread yet, I don't think it would be a big issue to do the accounting manually. A couple years from now you may need to look into some accounting automation though.

True, current encodings allow for 2 possible address-types. One starts with a '3'. These are nested P2SH addresses. The other one starts with 'bc1' and has exclusively lower case characters. This is the native segwit address format. Bech 32 has some advantages, such as smaller qr-codes, better error-detection, some auto-complete functionality and better human readability.
You won't see that many addresses with the bech32 format atm, for it needs 'pure' SegWit software. With many people using seeds (bip32) to organise/restore their wallets, this newer bech32 format would cause problems. Hence why most people use nested P2SH atm. Over time we should see more and more people switching over to bech32 though as wallets develop more. Electrum 3.0 was the first wallet to fully enable segwit with bech32.
For now, using addresses with a 3 at the start is just fine.

it really isnt. It is confusing though, buts its irrelevant. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:13:22
Yes. If the send comes from a segwit address, then that transaction is getting a discount. It dont matter whether the recipient is a non-segwit or a segwit address.

Its fairly astute how Andreas acknowledged/predicted the likeliness of multiple schools of thought regarding scaling coming into effect. He described both BCH as well as LN before either existed.
Very interesting part in the middle on the accidental fork that happened in 2013. I knew of it, but never really looked deeper into it as it was outside my scope of understanding at the time.
In any case, if you're somewhat perceptive and eager to learn about what happens under the hood of Bitcoin, watching this video in full is recommended.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:54:19
As much as I commend your spirit and drive, if you are not a technical person, I would suggest not to do it yet. LN may have had some successful tests, but its not been tested enough yet. Everyone is excited (me too), but it doesnt hurt to wait for a more concrete deployment. Multiple groups are dedicating a lot of time to LN development. Wait for them to optimize the code first. After all this isn't some mod or early access for a game that is nearly finished. This is people sending and receiving money. It needs to work a 100%, not 95%.
edit: but if u wanna take that risk, best advice I could give you is to contact the bitrefil guy as he has done the only successful LN implementation on the mainnet for a commercial product that I know of.

Same here. The upload particularly is eating up my bandwidth. The only reason I can run a full node without hitting my limits is because its turned off when I'm not there.
With blocks being full all the time right now, unlike earlier years, the blockchain is getting larger at a steady pace. Take 10 years of full blocks (1mb), thats over 500gb of data. I sure hope by that time we are done with metered connections because I wont be able to seed half a terabyte of data to every person that syncs the blockchain for the first time. The rate at which data ceilings are increasing, I'm not worried. But if we had bigger blocks, this could be a problem. I can see 2mb or even 4mb working in the near future (for me and my data plan). But anything above that and we will seriously lose nodes, especially in non-first world countries. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:46:07
segwit is a protocol upgrade which reorganizes the data in a block, making it leaner. Furthermore, this different architecture of the blocks is backwards compatible (so its a soft-fork, rather than a hard-fork) and it allows for different upgrades and applications which were previously not possible. Lightning network is such an application, but also protocol upgrades like schnorr signatures for example.
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:32:32
I remember I used Multibit on mac osx and Electrum on Linux. The wallets were barebone, it forced you to know how bitcoin worked, which is a good thing as we automatically learned about security.
Nowadays people just install a mobile app and keep their seed on a photo in the cloud. They have no idea how bitcoin functions under the hood which causes them to lose their balance, ignore segwit because they have no idea what it does and they enter their private keys and seeds in online services like gullible idiots.
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:44:53
Its due to a large amount of consolidation transactions imo. These classify as 1 transaction but have many many inputs. If these inputs come from segwit addresses, the witness data can be large. Example: ~~

Lightning will not disincentivize mining. Look at it this way. Currently not a soul in the world is buying a beer or a coffee with bitcoin because every purchase would cost you a fee that does not scale with the price of a beer/coffee. Now with LN you could argue it becomes worth it to pay that fee, because you only have to pay it once when you open the channel. And you can have coffees every day of the year after that.

You are correct. I just took the first large input tx I found with 3's in the front. But the one I linked is multisig, not segwit. I've updated it now with a different tx that looks very similar, but is in fact SegWit.

segwit is short for segregated witness. Its a protocol upgrade that went into effect on august 1, 2017. It makes transactions and blocks leaner, allowing for more capacity and further upgrades to improve scalability. You can recognize segwit-addresses when they start with 'bc1' or when they start with 3, although multisignature addresses also start with a 3. So an address starting with a 3 is not exclusively segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:54:39
Yes you can. Segwit is a backwards compatible upgrade, so you can send any coins in any direction.

Not necessarily. One could open a channel to an exchange, requiring a one time onchain transaction after which you could send coins back and forth to the exchange through the LN.

Interesting piece!
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:57:41
You could bump the fee, if the wallet has that functionality (CPFP). You could also use a different wallet and send the exact same funds to your own address, which will cause a doublespend and the first transaction will not go through once the second has been confirmed. Or you can wait, if a transaction remains unconfirmed for a long period, mempools will drop it. 14 days iirc.

This fee has more to do with an excess amount of inputs rather than current mempool throttle. This will be an expensive transaction compared to any other average transaction at anytime. So I would suggest waiting till the mempool is at its absolute lowest.

The network was safe then, and the network is safe now. But it wasnt less or more safe. It took less money to perform a 51% attack 3 years ago for example, but the profit was also lower as Bitcoin was less valuable. By doing what you propose, you drop the economical input required for the attack without a proper reflection to the benefit from performing such an attack as the issuance rate would more or less stay the same. Could be an interesting idea however after the year 2140.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:15:29
It does indeed, which is what the author is saying. Nobody wants to use his coins right now for anything because buying something with it right now means missing the opportunity to buy more of that 'something' later. However at one point in time, people need stuff, like a car, house, groceries and whether they like it or not, they will have to spend that hoarded money. So what the author is saying is that this hoarding is not necessarily bad as it will lead to economic activities eventually. It will just take a while. 
The whole idea behind inflation is to push people to spend their money. My 1000$ today is best spent on a new computer right now, because that 1000$ wont be able to get me a computer 15 years from now.
The whole idea behind deflation is that it's a good store of value (gold for example) because if I have 1000$ but I don't need anything right now, I best protect it against inflation, making sure that whatever value 1000$ means today, has the same value 15 years from now. So that I can buy that computer at any point in the future and be able to afford it. 
The point being that once I actually need a computer I will be buying it and thus in the overall picture, whether an inflationary currency or a deflationary currency was used, a computer was bought. Economic activity happened. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:42:08
The average economist would most likely not see Bitcoin or any other supply-capped 'system' work. A major trend in economic beliefs for almost a century is that of perpetual inflation to encourage people to spend instead of hoard, because this boosts the economy and thus welfare. And it does, but it's far from perfect. Big economic recessions, little personal control over your own networth etc.
The concept of Bitcoin and other programmable money is new and there's no saying what a world running on it would look like. The economic implications are ridiculously interesting to me as well. This could change everything and rewrite the field of economics as we know it.
Here's an article in defense of a deflationary currency to give you a bit of both sides of the discussion:  
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:51:45
A fork is simply a different term for change to the protocol. Bitcoin is Bitcoin because we all agree it is Bitcoin, on a protocol level. Anyone can fork Bitcoin whenever he pleases. When someone/group/movement  initiates a fork they go in a different direction. It copies everything that has already happened before the fork and continues on a new path after the fork. 
A soft-fork is backwards compatible, a hardfork is not.
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:36:46
I don't particularly agree or disagree with the author. Whether he is wrong or right is hard to say. That's economics for you, every theory or school of thought works, until it doesn't. It's however interesting to see opinions and motivations on different sides of the debate.
When it comes to storing wealth, this is nothing new, people have been doing it since pre-fiat times. Right now most people getting into Bitcoin are all looking at gains, not at storage of wealth. And so were early gold hoarders, it took quite some time for that to lose its volatility as well and finally settle as a stable store of value. People have been storing value in art or real estate, or jewels as well. Bitcoin is just one more to this list. And wealthy people look to diversify their holdings as to protect themselves against one of these assets suddenly dropping in value. Bitcoin is looking to be one more tool to further diversify. It's deflationary model is perfect for it. This steep rise in price has very little to do with the average joe putting 500bux in it. It's more so fueled by a couple hundred wealthy people looking to store millions of $. So mainstream adoption, or usage as a currency is actually not even relevant anymore, nor required, for Bitcoin to keep soaring in value.
And now for the amazing part. Bitcoin is not just very similar to gold, its better, because its programmable. It could both service to those that look for a Gold 2.0 to store wealth as to those that look for a Dollar or Euro 2.0 to make transactions. For the latter however we need to scale. Lightning Network looks like the current way to go. Then imagine 1 single asset acting as both store of value and means of transaction. This has never been done before. The potential is hard to quantify here.
@_date: 2018-09-05 09:54:48
Some of these things you mention have changed, either through code or organically. The more seasoned bitcoin enthousiast or students of the code/protocol know this. However for an introduction video I'd say it may actually be wise to explain the original concept and the reasoning behind it. This video does a really good job at explaining the conceptual aspect of cryptocurrency, while giving a small peak into the technical side of the first blockchain. Many things have changed, now that we are 10 years later, and many things will continue to change, evolve and grow.
Nodes currently don't mine in the stricktest meaning of the word 'node' with regard to Bitcoin. But in the broader meaning of the word 'node', as in participant to the ecosystem, this stands. Yes, theoretically a miner and a node are different things. There's also many different types of nodes. As the blockchain grows and blocksize will eventually need to be adjusted, I expect we will also see the birth of partial or sharding nodes, for countries that lag in hardware/network requirements to be able to afford running a full node. Not everyone lives in the Western world after all. Most people don't actually.
The point about the valid chain is a bit of the same story. It got adjusted along the way. It used to be like the video sais, but it's not anymore. This whole video will grow with inaccuracies over time, as the subject matter changes over time. Nonetheless it is a solid conceptual explanation for people to try and understand the idea of cryptocurrency.
tl;dr You're not wrong by pointing out these inaccuracies, I noticed them too. But I wouldn't change the video because they aren't lies either, conceptually.

Not really. Fee's go to whoever solves the block. The miner decides which transactions to include in the block. It makes sense to include the transactions with the higher fee's. You could argue that someone might be trying to launder money via an affiliated miner by making transactions with fee's that are too low for an 'honest' miner to consider including it. However, the state of decentralization among miners at this moment means your 'colluding' miner may only solve a couple blocks per day. Furthermore, one of the honest miners might simply include your lower fee transaction anyway, in which case, the money would be lost. And lastly, a miner mining a block with only a particular type of nonsensical transaction would soon be caught anyway as the blockchain is public. 
And given the decidedly superior laundering possibilities offered by some other crypto's, using the very public and slow bitcoin blockchain is really just plain dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:51:46
Centralization is against the design philosophy of bitcoin. However centralization is not something you can measure or quantify. The LN works through payment channels. An example of how this could centralize payments goes like this:
Your favourite news website adds a payment option for every article you read. You frequent the website and like their content so you open a channel. Every time you want to read the second half of an article you scan a QR code and perform a micro-transaction, half a cent for example. If all readers do this, you have many people connecting to the news website. Now the cool thing about the LN is that if you wish to make a payment to someone and he happens to be a reader of that news website as well, and thus has a payment channel open to that website, you don't have to open a new channel to deal between the two of you.
So initially we had:  
Person A &lt;----payment channel----&gt; News website  
Person B &lt;----payment channel----&gt; News website  
...  
Person X &lt;----payment channel----&gt; News website  
Now if Person A wants to transact with lets say person M:  
Person A &lt;----payment channel----&gt; Person M  
Is not necessary, as the payment could go like this instead:  
Person A &lt;----payment channel----&gt; News website &lt;----payment channel---&gt; Person M  
So you see, a sort of centralization happened where the News website is becoming a clearing house for many people. I don't see this as a problem however as it is still possible to open a payment channel between person A and person M anyway if so desired. Much like I can wire you 100 bux in which case my money goes to my bank and from my bank to you. Or we could meet and I'll pay you cash, no intermediaries involved. Not to mention that LN aside, we can always still transact on-chain if so desired.

An interesting quote at the end of the article:


Lots of people writing articles in traditional media on how this HAS to go down for this and that reason. But none of these people can put their money where their mouth is *as they have no Bitcoins*. Traditional people now analyzing the scene for the first time, not quite grasping what Bitcoin at its core is so good at. The decentralized nature of it, the distributed and border-less nature of it, I dont have to go on, we all know these and many more. They might pressure other newcomers to not buy, but these don't pressure us hodlers to sell *at all*. Which means price will not come down crashing like they initially claim. Because they may call it energy-consuming, unbacked by a government or the best fucking money-laundering tool since taxes were brought onto this earth. If I ain't selling, and you ain't selling, and that other guy isn't either and those naysayers that dont own any, can't sell any. Well then we're just going to keep going. Up's and down's sure, but we'll keep going.

I do not disagree. I guess everything depends on the timeframe. Lets say we are in a bubble. Every indication points to it, and I am not blind to this. Lets say it pops, and we drop 60% over the next 2 weeks. In my state of mind, I could not justify such a drop, yet I am open to the possibility. If this happens, then I still would be a firm believer of the potential of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, same as I was when it was at 100$ and at 1000$ etc. And in due time I believe it will regain the value of what it had at the top before the bubble blew. Because I am a fundamental believer of the concept, and I don't care about whatever value it represents in dollars or euros or yen. And while many may be in this as an investment or a quickprofit scheme, I am not, and many of the larger holders aren't either.
@_date: 2018-09-21 14:01:20
This is true. Relevant nodes are most likely among those that upgraded already, as they always upgrade soon after release. For the sake of decentralization it is however advised that lesser active nodes do the same thing. An event like this is a good time to remind everyone of this good practice. Even if you're only using your node to verify and relay, it would be validating invalid blocks and aid the case of a chainsplit, which wouldnt hold value, but would change perception of which bitcoin is the actual bitcoin. This is a breeding ground for replay attacks. 
While the specific number of nodes compared to total nodes is not a numbers game, it is an indicator. Current latest version nodes: 1823

That is a fair point. Many are blind to the struggles that Bitcoin has to endure. Fortunately, the issues with Bitcoin are not unknown and people are working on them. I refer you to this post: 
As to your first point. The average joe, investing a couple hundred to a couple thousand bux has no effect whatsoever on the people that have invested multiple millions into the system. And these averages Joe's getting shook by just another mainstream news article and selling have no effect whatsoever on the fundamental investors in the space. Someone who invested a large amount of capital at a strategic moment is never influenced by just a random news article or the actions of a couple people with dismal funds.

It's perfectly possible do set up a cold storage wallet that is secure. It's what we did before hardware wallets became a thing and gave us a little more convenience. Airgapped machine, Tails. Set up in airgapped environment. Check signatures on all software obv. Never let that machine touch any sort of connection. Hell, you could write down the seed or priv key and then destroy all hardware used in the process. Unless you want to still use it actively. In that case you can sign transactions and use a safe medium to export them from the offline to the online environment.

I'll tell you what I tell other people who are not technically savvy. No use getting into details with them anyway. It's a conceptual explanation.
Think of mining as solving a sudoku. They're usually 9 by 9 and take a human between 5 and 15 minutes to solve, depending on difficulty. Mining is essentially the same, only the sudoku is now 1000 by 1000 in size and is being solved by computer processing power. And in fact, the more people are trying to solve the sudoku, the bigger in size it becomes. This is to ensure a sudoku gets solved on average every 10 minutes, at least for Bitcoin. When a miner finds the solution to this puzzle, he gets a fixed reward, called the block reward. The miner can then additionally add transactions, which are currently in queue, to this block and reap the rewards from said transactions too, aka the transaction fees. All this information (answer to the puzzle + transactions + some other technical stuff) is then broadcast to the network and verified. Once approved by the network, we move on to the next sudoku.
Why though? is what people ask next. Well, by making a puzzle really hard to solve, while in this consecutive blocks system, you make it really hard to edit. If someone wanted to change something along the way. An external factor, a governing entity or a malicious actor. No matter who for whatever reasoning. He would have to solve all those sudoku's again, and do so, faster than the whole network itself. In other words, we have an immutable datachain. And that has value when you think on it for a second.
An answer like this shows you 'get the idea of it' without actually going into technical details. Hope that helps, feel free to ask follow-up questions.

I once dreamt Bitcoin went to 10000. Rushed to the computer when I woke up, and saw it was still around 700, struggling to get past that 1000 barrier once again. I pondered whether it would ever go past a 1000 again that day. I remember I was kinda gloomy that day, because I feared people didn't care enough to learn, to improve, to better their lives. To question what we have, and to perpetually strive to get better. I sort of accepted that many people in the world are just sheep and rather bend over than stand tall. Rather complain to their neighbour about how the system/government/society screwed them and they couldnt do anything about it, than revolt.
As it turns out, my lack of faith in people may have been overstated. And my dream did come true. Although greed reared its ugly head and had a big say in the matter too.
I haven't dreamt since..

My take on it is this: mining is becoming cheaper. What I really mean by that is that slowly but surely we are seeing migration of mining towards cheaper countries (electricity-wise) and a small percentage renewable energy. Rather than just turning off the ASIC and respecting the negative income, you adapt and move your ASIC's to a country that will make them profitable again. Or you plug them in different energy sources which are cheaper. I have no real data for this, so it's more an assumption based on my own experience of having to get my hands on a high end GPU for my gaming rig a couple months ago. No mining hardware is leaving the space whatsoever, so it can only go up.

Do note that this would affect the LN as well. Yes the second layer accounting done through the LN can still continue, but opening and closing new channels would not be possible anymore, and the ability to do so is imperative for the security model of the LN.

There's one thing you're forgetting and that is history. In order for the chain to be compromised through mining, you would indeed need a majority of the hashrate in order to acquire the longest chain.
However, if you want to change the ledger somewhere in the past, you would need to redo all the work (proof-of-work) since the genesis block, which gets harder and harder the longer time goes by, and thus the chain gets longer.
If we assume someone wants to control the chain (and not kill it), a large hashrate could do it (in theory) but there's the second participant in the ecosystem to avoid a takeover: the nodes. The 'time metaphor' made by another user here some time ago is a good way to explain this. We all have our watches set to 10 AM, we all agree 10 AM is right now, and an hour from now it will be 11 AM. If a malicious actor took over the chain with massive hashpower, he could then decide what time it is. He sais 10 AM is now in fact 4 PM, and we're playing by my rules now. This leaves us with a choice, do we change our watch to 4 AM as well or do we stick to our notion of time? As long as the nodes (aka we) still decide its 10 AM we will continue on our chain, we will fork. And the malicious actor will be sitting on a different and valueless version of the protocol.
Now this is not a perfect analogy and in reality such an event is quite a bit more complicated. While this is theoretically possibly, it most likely won't happen and the reason is economical. You have you're miners and your nodes, but you also have your users. They will still be using and transacting with the Bitcoin that they know, the other chain which was compromised won't have any value and nobody will be using it. So it would be a very expensive endeavour to achieve basically nothing.
To get to your actual question, what will happen to mining once close to or all bitcoins are mined and the blockreward becomes so small that a high value of bitcoin would be required for miners to be incentivized to continue operations. First of, there's fee's. Thats an economical incentive to mine that will never go away. Secondly, nothing states that we must stick with proof-of-work forever. We can decide to switch over to proof-of-stake or another mechanism. Proof-of-work is needed - *initially* - to assure immutability. It is not needed per se once the ecosystem is large enough.
A common misconception is that more hashpower is mandatory, the more valuable bitcoin becomes. *It is not.* With proof-of-work, some miners are always needed. In theory, one is enough (this is how Satoshi began). The chain can be easier compromised when hashpower is low, but as long as we all agree on what time it is, miners or malicious actors can do what they want.
The real danger, in the next 10-20 years is the blockchain clogging. If a large percentage of hashpower were to stop mining right after the difficulty retarget, this could slow the chain to a halt, as the difficulty would be disproportionate to the actual hashpower. This could tank the price, forcing the rest of the miners to also swap their hashpower to a different chain. Hope all that explains it somehow, sorry for the long text, it's an interesting thinking exercise :)

Some stuff I noticed so far:
- Some words start with a capital, when other words dont. 
- Many words and math, but some letters just stand alone. You can find a C, W, M. Some digits are single as well
- There's a number crossed out by some icon on the bottom right of the big Bitcoin B. I don't know if or what that icon means though.
- There's quite a bit of open space in the top right corner, given how filled the rest of the image is.
- Some numbers make sense as a part of math or whitepaper references. But the longer numbers make no sense to me, theyre not dates or references to the whitepaper, like 19981101
edit: the icon is a notdef glyph, the larger numbers appear to be dates as well
edit 2: heres a different colored version if you were starting to see blurry like I was 
edit 3: the words with a capital letter are the same way in the whitepaper and some of the larger numbers are larger timestamps, so no hidden meaning there either.

Let me mentally break this down for myself and maybe others here can fill in gaps in my thought process.
- It's either a private key or a seed (with or without additional password).
- It's either hidden in the image itself and can be found through its shapes, lines, position, coloring or its hidden in the words and numbers and a correlation must be found here
If its a private key we must think of the format. As far as I can remember it can be either binary 256 bits. It can be HEX, 64 digits or it is WIF or WIF-compressed. I somehow don't think its binary because that would be too long. It wont be WIF or WIF-compressed either as these have lower and upper case characters, which does not seem the case in this picture. The capital letters found in the image are merely direct copy/pastes from the whitepaper. HEX seems to make the most sense.
If its HEX we got to look for letters and digits. But the order of those is the issue obviously.
If its a seed it makes sense to filter the words in the image for those compliant with a BIP list. One thing bothering me is the numbers. Some can be found in the whitepaper, like the 4 digit ones, representing years. But others can not be found at all in the whitepaper, nor are they seed words. They have to have meaning. And then there's the notdef glyph..

There's a bit of a gap in the market regarding payment processors. The biggest (and one of the only) is BitPay, which has been discredited lately due to their hostile take on forks etc. I would advise against them given their current policies. Read this as an intro: 
One payment processor which I've seen a local bar implement is this one: 
but depending on your location they might or might not be available.
There's also the more technical open-source payment processor BTCPay. It allows you to copy the essentials of BitPay but while running your own node. This is most geared towards online shops however, no terminals or other hardware.
Just accepting Bitcoin is easy, all you need is a wallet, be it on a phone, computer or tablet. But you probably already know that and I'm assuming you're looking to implement something automated with accounting and converting built-in. This is scarce right now. You either have your big companies who have in-house IT set the whole thing up, or you have you burrito-stand-guy with the phonewallet. The in between is kind of lacking right now, although there has to be someone doing it. I'll update if I find something.
Edit: found an old bookmark that could prove useful 
@_date: 2018-05-19 12:26:51
The seed encapsulates the whole wallet. This is because keeping track of every single keypair is rough as it is advised for privacy reasons to use a new address for every transaction. Most wallets work with a seed, Mycelium included. You can restore any wallet using the seed in most software, whether on desktop or mobile.

Technically all it needs is one miner for Bitcoin to function. Nodes have a different role, they verify the rules. They ensure that what we call Bitcoin is truly Bitcoin. 
Now, the end of the block reward is estimated to be around the year 2140 iirc. That's a long long time from now given the length of human life. By that time we may see blocksize increases, changes to the PoW system, added incentives for nodes and miners alike, etc.
In short, as it currently stands, once the last coin is mined, the blockchain continues as long as there's at least one miner. The incentive for that one miner will be the fee's that people currently add to their transactions.
In reality, the protocol will have changed undoubtedly by then. If Bitcoin failed, then this discussion doesnt matter. If Bitcoin is still around, deep thought and changes will be applied to the protocol to ensure Bitcoin stays alive and well with plenty incentives to keep the network operational and secure.

@_date: 2019-11-22 02:14:23
They can't say for certain, but they could always ask. Take your example above. Law enforcement has a man on the inside of the darknet market or they just figured out the darknet wallet. That stuff isnt hard to figure out. Through backtracking they then see you buying bitcoin, then a couple hops, then those coins end up buying drugs. They don't know anything for certain, but they could always ask you 'hey, what did you buy with them bitcoins? Also do you mind doing a drug test, you got nothing to hide right?' They didn't know for certain, yet here they are putting 2 and 2 together. I don't think any of this is likely, but with Monero, none of this would have been possible at all. By design. Bitcoin was never designed to be anonymous like Monero is.

Hehe no worries. Not everyone here has to 'win' some sort of argument. I'll answer any question if asked in a normal way, and if I know the answer of course ^^
@_date: 2019-11-21 16:30:51
Anonymity depends on how you look at it. The short answer is no. For Monero, the short answer is yes.
Now for the long answers. Anonymity can mean you as a person can transact anonymous, but it could also mean the amount transacted is unknown, or that the balance in the senders account is unknown, or that the final balance of the receiver is unknown.
So rather than being mysterious like that last sentence I'll just explain how things work a little. 
***Avg Bitcoin Transaction***
You send Bitcoin from address A to address B. 
* It is KNOWN how much you sent.
* It is KNOWN from which btc address you sent it.
* It is KNOWN to which btc address you sent it.
* It is KNOWN how much btc you had on the address you sent from, and also KNOWN how much btc was already on the receivers address.
* It is KNOWN when you sent it.
* It is NOT known who you are.
* It is NOT known where you are physically.
All the above assumes your communications are not currently being tracked by an outside force/group/government. The issue with Bitcoin and anonymity however, is how did you acquire the Bitcoin to begin with? There's roughly 3 ways to get Bitcoin. 
1. You got it from another person.
2. You bought it from an exchange or other company that deals in conversion.
3. You mined it.
Of the above 3, the only anonymous way to acquire Bitcoin is the third one. Because in the case of the first 2, whoever sent the bitcoin to you, knows the address he sent it to is yours, and he can follow what you do with it afterwards. He doesnt have all the info to know exactly what you are paying, or who. But by putting two and two together one can guestimate at what you're doing. Also sometimes, just the the act of 'owning' or 'having' Bitcoin could be an issue. In the first 2 cases, someone out there "knows" you have Bitcoin and he also knows how much. Is it an issue? Perhaps, perhaps not. It sure isnt anonymous. This is why in general we call Bitcoin pseudonymous. Can Bitcoin be used anonymous? Yes! But you need to have mined coins, or perhaps found or stolen the coins (aka the keys). And be very conscious about how you transact to obfuscate your ownership.
***Monero Transactions***
I wont go into too much detail here, Monero has a fairly active subreddit in which all these questions have already been answered in far more detail than I ever could explain them. But in general, Monero achieved something amazing. Because in the example I used above for Bitcoin, every single 'KNOWN' can be replaced with a 'NOT known'. So a standard transaction is fully anonymous. But how about acquisition of Monero? Here the same applies to mining, its the closest to anonymous you'll get. But what if you get Monero from an exchange? Are you permanently fucked? Not really. The exchange will always know how much Monero you bought, because that data has nothing to do with any blockchain. But once you received the Monero, all you have to do is send it to yourself to anonymize every aspect of it. From that point forward, nobody can known anything. It uses many different technologies that Bitcoin does not have in its protocol. RingCT for example. But many others as well, again, I refer you to their subreddit, it's very interesting stuff. It makes Monero the most *fungible* of all the coins out there. Look that word up, if you don't know what it means.
Hope all this helped ;)

People are often set in their beliefs. Learning and understanding something new, especially when it comes from modern technology, is hard for many people. Something tells me that these legislators who are often in their fifties would be on this very sub, spreading the word, if only they were 25 years younger.
Young people, at least those young at heart, tend to dream of a different future, a better future. Those with some years behind them have already fought their battles. Won some, lost some. They're cynical. It's the way she goes. We won't be any different. To get behind a concept that is so radically different from the direction we are currently going is no easy task. 
The beauty of technology is that no one person, institution or government needs to approve of it for it to succeed. The emergence of new tech and how it is used is mostly driven by the people. Whether someone like Janet, and the position she holds, approves or understands bitcoin is ultimately irrelevant. Her part in all this is merely a tiny acceleration or deceleration in the bigger scheme of things, and for a small part of the world.
I only hope she can find herself to learn about this technology, for her own personal intellectual enrichment. She seems willing to, so good for her.
@_date: 2018-10-23 09:43:30
It isn't how Bitcoin is going to work. The idea is that we exhaust any way we can to increase on-chain volume without hardforking before we increase block capacity through a hardfork. If Bitcoin and LN ever reach worldwide transaction levels, then a blocksize increase will be mandatory. We've just not reached that level.
BCH goes about it differently. They say, why wait, increase now, and increase they did. Most blocks are very empty, but if need be, they could process more transactions in a short time than BTC. But if we see worldwide adoption levels, even their blocksize increases would not be sufficient, they'd have to increase even more.
Its all a balancing act, and one is not necesserily better or worse than the other. Just different solutions to the same problem, each with their advantages and disadvantages.

Conceptually, the more unstable politics and global economics are, the more interesting the use case for crypto becomes.

1. There's no financial incentive.
2. Not all nodes are full nodes, many people don't realise their node does not have outbound connections, only inbound.
3. Many countries are technologically behind. This top 22 shows no countries in Africa, no countries in South-America and very little Asian countries. These are all First World countries.
4. Some countries who are First World still have very expensive mobile and internet services. The country I am from still has a cap on data, despite being fiber enabled. Which is why I only run my node after midnight and not after 12 noon. Long live the corporate grip of telecom giants.
5. In some countries, Bitcoin is still illegal. These people are forced to operate through TOR, and that really lowers node participation as its even more technical than running a node through clearnet. 
In terms of adoption and for the sake of geographical decentralization it also serves to look at the node count per 100.000 capita. Bigger countries will automatically top rankings like the one in the OP. This one gives a more interesting view:

Yea its convenient. Mobile OS's (android and iOS) are relatively safe compared to desktop OS's. Don't be fooled though, they're still hotwallets. If you use your phone to download shit and go to fishy websites, you can get fucked just as much, but the area of attack is smaller. Offline wallets is the safest way to go obviously, but for smaller amounts a phone wallet is nothing to be afraid of. Just make sure you have the seed or private keys backed up *offline* in case your phone gets stolen or breaks down or something. There's many around, especially for android, do some research, find something you like. I wrote an article on it a while ago, it surely is outdated but it may still be useful in some ways:

It's also a good way for them to learn how to safeguard something. We're so used to letting others take care of our belongings. Give them a seed with some coins in it or a private key or a paper wallet or something, but keep a copy on your end too. Next year you can ask them if they have been able to keep it safe and not lose it. If they do, another 5 bux gets added too it (+ other gift of course, they cant get the same gift twice in a row, poor kids). :)
Learned this the hard way myself. Well, hard for the people I gave it too. So many friends &amp; family I gave spare change in 2014, 2015 both on mobile wallets and paper wallets, they all lost it, and its worth quite a bit more now too. It helped them taking storage of seeds serious now too.

This is a great attitude and I wish more people would have it instead of blindly buying. Buy small amounts, send some to friends &amp; family to get yourself and them familiar with it. Learn how to mine (any device can do it) to familiarize yourself with how it works and why its meaningless on anything other than specific mining hardware. Start running a node to understand why it is important and why Bitcoin has the limitations it does. Test out different wallets (desktop, mobile, hardware eventually) to understand the risks and benefits of each type. To understand the importance of mnemonic seeds, and the difference with private keys and how transactions work.
And most of all, read. Read lots on how it all works. The more you understand of how it works under the hood, the better you'll understand why it has the potential it does. And the more you'll dig in the more you'll realise, it's not just a currency, it's not just a network, but an ecosystem that has economical, political and personal implications. And they all keep eachother in check.

A lot of businesses work like this, they use low-grade payment processors and it's always a mess with the refunds. I've had similar experiences. These businesses need to realise - themselves - that directly accepting crypto is key both to the success and the philosophy of crypto. Currently they don't care about it, they get convinced by external companies to enable and handle it for them as there was a lot of hype in 2017. They receive nothing but complaints and they will soon drop it and draw their conclusions that crypto is shit without ever getting to learn about why it can benefit them or how it works.
Open-source payment gateways like BTCPay are essential to this. So what I would do (what I've already done) is sending them an e-mail explaining them that Coinbase (or BitPay) is a payment processor that does not care all too much about user-experience. No company should use their service for accepting payments and if they (Expedia) really want to become a positive force in their respective field whilest integrating the future which is crypto payments, they should look to install such systems in-house using either open-source software or at worst propriety software. Any half-decent IT'er can do this in just a couple days. And by doing so they could benefit directly from it. Crypto payments as a service is only a plus to your business if the service actually works as intented. Otherwise it hurts you as a company.

Your wallet most likely is segwit indeed, which starts with a 3 as well. First off, make sure you took the private key that corresponds to that receiving address. Secondly, input said private key in an SPV wallet, which doesnt require you to download the whole blockchain. The easiest way to go about this would be to download an app on your phone. Electrum or Mycelium, plenty of options. Just look for a segwit wallet on your phone and that should do it tbh.

It's a concern I've heard from others before. My guess is you'd prefer to trade with gold rather than with bitcoin because gold is tangible.
On the other hand, digital (non-tangible) assets and items have had value for more than a decade now. And deservedly so. You may think bitcoin does not have material value because it is not material. But that doesnt mean it doesnt have value, despite not being material. In such an analogy only coins and bills have value. A bank account displaying numbers rooted from 1's and 0s does not.
You're giving me an anti-tech vibe. Reminds me of the Unabomber (without the bombs). Nothing wrong with it and nothing personal neither. Just an observation.

You must be making a mistake somewhere as this is not exactly a difficult or rare operation. I've done it plenty times. Are you really sure the private key is the correct private key to unlock the funds to that specific public address? And not the private key to some other address?

Every new user to the network increases that though, and unless you're looking to make really large payments any throughput should theoretically work. There's always the mainchain if you want to transfer a million bux in one go.

I think everyone here is very aware of the conversions that (still) need to happen in order for merchants to incorporate crypto payments. Why there aren't any better payments processors out there, I can not tell for sure. I can only assume the legislative and administrative side is horribly difficult and tedious. Almost any business will prefer a stable unit of account, which is why adoption is so slow and implementations that do exist, are frustrating. It's *the* challenge right now but that doesn't mean this can't be solved or improved. 
As for payments processing and how difficult it is. I've seen small start-ups in my area do it just fine for smaller businesses like bars and restaurants. But something seems to not click with the bigger businesses. Again I can only assume its regulation, legislation and large accounting that's causing friction.

You are correct, we probably know the exact same things, you just said it in a weird way that might confuse some that dont understand the mechanism.
Furthermore I'd like to point out that it's not rare for blocks to take longer than usual, even when hashrate isnt being manipulated. I've seen a block taking over an hour to get solved. Only 2 in an hour is not that rare at all ;-)

Create offline private keys or full seeds. Give them those keys or seeds. Keep a copy of those keys/seeds because in my experience, about 90% of the people I gave coins, lost those coins because they have no concept of backing up something, no matter how hard you stress it. Give someone bitcoin out of the blue, ask him about it 2-3 years later, he most likely has no clue where he put the 'damn words' or that phone he had is long gone and he forgot about the coins on it..

If I recall my research and own education on the protocol correctly, the main reason public keys were hashed was to make them shorter and more user-friendly. It had little to do with security.
Hashing the public keys protects them against some attacks I guess, but like I said, I think it was for convenience.
Maybe can shed some deeper insight?

I'm a uni educated economist and as such I too was raised on inflation. The problem being with economists is that they are so set in this belief that inflation is necessary that they refuse to think of a world without it. They can't think outside of the box anymore. There is an incessant need apparantly to meddle with the economy when it's not going as good as we want. There is however an old economic principle known as the 'invisible hand'. I find that principle often overlooked or ignored.
Inflation is a good thing in some ways. But it's also bad in some ways. I think a deflationary currency could work just as good, despite it not being perfect either. In it's current state of volatility, bitcoin is not useable as a currency. But given adequate adoption this could stabilize just as well, much like gold. 
And the whole argument of people not going to spend anymore because their money will be worth more tomorrow is a bogus one. People mainly buy because they want something, not because they need something. Currently they in-debt themselves to buy stuff they cant afford. Loans are possible with both an inflationary as well as a deflationary currency.

I'll give you a more elaborate answer. Let me start by saying my comment will most-likely be the correct answer. It is however possible something different happened.
Coinbase is an exchange. It swaps cryptocurrencies to fiat money and back. People do this all over the world using Coinbase. When someone exchanged Dollars for Bitcoin, he/she can then ask for a withdrawal of the freshly exchanged Bitcoin to a personal address or a storage device or any valid bitcoin address for any reason. As Coinbase has many users, they have to send many transactions all the time. To avoid unnecessary load on the blockchain they bundle these withdrawal requests. This allows them to make one enormous transaction from time to time. This allows for 'leaner' transactions, thus less load on the blockchain. 
So in fact when you ask for a withdrawal from Coinbase you are not making a crypto transaction. You merely send a request to Coinbase to make that transaction. Coinbase owns the coins, so only coinbase can send the coins. When they do so or how often they do so, is completely up to them. This is why people always advise against making payments from an exchange. 
When you showed the waiter you made the transaction using Coinbase, you merely showed him the request to Coinbase to withdraw. You didn't send anything. Thats also why the waiter did not get a confirmation that the transaction had been made, because it simply hadnt. No transaction added to the mempool in that time.
 
That leaves the question of where the coins are now. Well in all likelyhood, they are with the merchant by now. It just took some time as Coinbase batches transactions for reasons I explained above. You should be able to see the withdrawal in your Coinbase account. And from there you should see the address the coins went to, aka the QR code you scanned. If that address has your transaction in it with at least 1 confirmation, the coins are with the merchant. They just arrived late. And you paid twice, once in cash, once in crypto :)
Coinbase can't do anything anymore at this point as the coins are no longer under their control. They are under the control of the merchant, so talk to the merchant, because he has your money ;-)

Any resources or books you can recommend to have a better understanding of how our satellites currently work?
@_date: 2019-01-28 12:01:42
It can actually. A very fast and severe drop in value could turn away 99% of the hashrate and essentially grind the blockchain to a halt, making it nigh unusable for a prolonged period of time.
I don't see it as likely, but it is a theoretical point of failure. It can't fail as a concept, but it can fail as a technology restricted by its design parameters.
@_date: 2019-01-07 19:12:30

@_date: 2018-02-24 17:24:51
If I had to give some sort of explanation it would go like this: Large investors have had their eye on bitcoin for some time now. Ever since it peaked above 1000$ and the subsequent crash due to the MtGox hack, it has been on the radar of some investors looking for high risk high reward investments. But the severeness of that crash, the uncertainty and internal arguments between 2 camps concerning the scaling debate and a somewhat negative vibe from regulators made it a bad entry. Then in the next year, the bottom was discovered financially, regulators turned more positive and bans and negative regulation proved time and time again to be ineffective and inconsequential. And right around the springtime 2017 the scaling debate got kind of resolved. The NY agreement happened, a date was set 'in the code' for a User-Activated Soft-Fork in result (a big win for user-driven consensus btw) and the other side of the debate followed through with a hard-fork (Bitcoin Cash). 
So in a way, the stars alligned, big money entered the ecosystem (think Novogratz, and many others of course) and this caused Bitcoin to reach the news again. And this time around the focus was no longer on the darknetmarkets and criminals, the catchphrase was 'bubble'. And it became a self-fulfilling prophecy.

Not entirely true, though it does help of course. Take gold for example. Very little transactions are made using gold, yet it does have value.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:30:02
I agree. I didn't mention it because the opposite is not really proven. And it can't be proven. For all we know, 6 months from now, RAM and storage space will become 25 times cheaper, and increasing the blocksize will seem like the best option. Or maybe it doesn't. I personally do feel it hurts decentralization, and I judge this from the bandwidth stats I have on my full node. But it is not a definitive claim I am willing to use in an argument. Nobody can really put a number on how big the block can increase before it hurts decentralization as decentralization is a subjective concept. It can not be measured. If it were, we could make an argument to make the blocksize smaller, to 0.5mb. Because more decentralized is better? I believe it is a balance.
It's one of those endless arguments. Sometimes you have to make the mistake before you know its a mistake, which is why I am glad we have both visions deployed right now.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:21:03
It is obviously quite a bit more complicated than my metaphor can depict. But OP asked for a layman's explanation. Not everybody has been around since Satoshi and has followed everything and learned everything there is to learn about Bitcoin and its recent history ;-)
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:47:51
I think it holds more often than you'd expect. People tend to not wait for it, they rather meddle with markets first, before any sort of balance can be naturally established. 
Safe to say most of my fellow economists disagree, just like you.
@_date: 2018-04-20 01:18:25

Could you provide some additional reading on this? I'd be much appreciative. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:51:31


But a lower hashrate would make it easier (economically) to use this attack vector. Say if the hashrate were to drop to pre-ASIC levels. It would just need 1 ASIC-farm to powerup again and destroy the system. There's no direct economical incentive to do so, but just stating that it is possible, and it wouldn't be nearly as hard or expensive as it is to get 51% hashrate today.

To quote Margaret Thatcher:


This seems to be exactly what's happening in Venezuela right now.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:08:32
Hmm correct. Would that require a soft or hardfork?
@_date: 2018-04-19 23:58:45
Apparently its pretty hard to answer a question seriously nowadays. So here goes:
A couple years ago, the community was actively discussing how Bitcoin would scale. The original idea, offered by Satoshi, was to increase the blocksize periodically. On the other hand, a lot of new developers came onto the scene and Satoshi was long gone, even at that point. These developers proposed to first and foremost make the blockchain as lean as possible before just increasing the blocksize. There were reasons for this. A blocksize increase is a hardfork (in other words, not backwards compatible). They proposed the SegWit upgrade, which is very complicated, but it could be enabled as a softfork (backwards compatbile) and is thus deemed safer. Reasons against the segwit upgrade (from a technical point of view) is that it takes adoption from users in the ecosystem and it is complicated stuff, whereas a hardforked blocksize increase would be instant and easy to enable.
Long story short, debate raged on for years and consensus was not reached among the community, mostly due to political and economical reasons, which I wont get into. So both camps went forward with their vision. The bigblockers hardforked and increased the blocksize to 8mb. The segwit camp enabled the tech, and adoption is still ongoing, almost a year later.
To put it in a metaphor: Roads are congested. 
Bitcoin sais: lets automate how we drive, lets optimise the cars so that we can jam more cars on the roads, lets push people to start driving smaller cars, so we can fit more on the roads we have, etc. Its smart, complicated, slow and ultimately effective.
Bitcoin Cash sais: lets build more roads. And once these are full too, we build even more roads. Its fast, simple, and immediately effective. Until they are full again of course..
I think its amazing both versions exist, and very interesting. I have my opinion on the best design philosophy, but thats outside the scope of this comment.
@_date: 2018-04-01 05:43:37
Which is..?
@_date: 2017-05-24 00:51:10
From what I've read (and correct me if I'm wrong) the blocksize would increase to 3 or 4mb with Segwit. Which isnt viable in the longterm anyway. Which would result in lots of people using sidechains, which will be centralized. 
Furthermore, due to the dis-inflationary issuance rate, fee's will become a larger part of miner revenue. Less miners = lower hashrate = less security.  
The way I currently see it, both will be needed in the long term. Which is why a compromise seems the most logical solution to me. 
For today, right now, I'm more eager for segwit than I am for a blocksize increase through a HF, for it will hold off centralization for the time being and aid mainstream adoption. But I don't see how Bitcoin can maintain dominance through security if we don't increase blocksize at some point.
@_date: 2017-05-25 00:01:23
how unexcellent of you. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:29:51


I'll leave that one for now. I have no real information to prove or disprove this. Guess we'll just have to find out.


Isn't it both? High hashrate protects against consensus attacks such as the 51% attack. But I get what you're saying. A drop in hashrate would not necessarily compromise security unless it is significant. Good point.


The same can be said the other way around though. Segwit has an increase too, so both proposals deem an increase necessary or beneficiary


If Bitcoin served the same purpose for all of us, we wouldn't have this whole debate. Some see it as store of value, some see it as digital cash, some see it as a quick profit, some see it as cypherpunk revolution that takes power away from governments and institutions. Consensus on anything is tricky, clearly. :)

I hear you, but a complete online enterprise is still bound to a certain country, with certain laws and obligations. Imagine if we were free from this restraint. I think we'd see cryptocurrencies take a more prominent role in this world. 
We created a completely decentralised currency, but have no decentralised foundation to make maximum use of it. 
Now, making a country on our own may be, like I said initially, just a dream. But it's not 100% impossible and I think it would help our cause, regardless of which one that is for each and everyone of you bitcoiners :)
