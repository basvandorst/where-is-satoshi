You're missing the part where no bank is going to be caught dead holding a shit-ton of US dollars for a company that essentially issues a digital US dollar without the US government's permission, so Tether keeps its dollars scattered betwixt a bunch of foreign bank accounts, likely without the banks' knowledge of what the money is being held for.
Not to mention there's no way the physical dollars are insured so if their funds are ever frozen or confiscated... you get the idea.
I still maintain that Tether is doing the crypto space a huge favor by making dollars more liquid between exchanges than banks can.

Because long term trends are easier to predict and market cycles mirror psychology.
@_date: 2018-08-05 13:20:11
Make trades with your own Bitcoin. I make money trading mine. I share my plays because I make money.
Using 2014-2015 as a model, the dumping is pretty much almost done (and is currently signaled by lower and lower volume during dumps, and lower price drops before meeting resistance), and the next year of price action was low-volume sideways trading, which is the perfect time to accumulate. (As I said in my first succinct comment above. This is where we're heading.)
Your turn to answer rhetoric: Since the lowest price anyone has gotten entering BTC in 2018 is 5.8k-6.8k, who in their right mind would actually advise another person to sell for wait for a lower entry point this close to a 12 month low? Or do we buy high and sell low now?

@_date: 2018-08-06 18:18:08
It makes perfect sense when Bitcoin has outperformed virtually every stock in a 5 year period and makes all of its significant gains over 10 random days in a year.
But as I said 5 comments ago before entertaining your circular logic for the last 2-3 days, it would take a crystal ball to predict those days, which is why accumulation is the correct play.
If you disagree, I don't care.
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:28:08
You might want to think about that
@_date: 2018-08-05 00:46:47
Sentiment, market volume, support turned resistance, comparison to previous market cycles, lack of price action matching bullish news, price dumping on bearish news, fewer retail buyers, previous retail buyers still in the red from buying every price point between 7k and 19.9k, consistent regulatory rejection of products...

If money is being spent immediately it really doesnt matter which currency was spent if they are receiving a good in exchange. Take a farmer in a hyperinflated country - its a hell of a lot easier to predict the state of bitcoin in a year as opposed to a zimbabwe dollar to buy seeds or whatever. Bitcoin will probably do relatively well as designed and the inflationary currency will do predictably worse. I understand the ops point though. Theres a lot of backseat driving from first world bitcoiners acting like they could use bitcoin to change things if they were an African or something. That part is strange

I've found that a good way to get people into crypto is to owe them some money for something and then offer to pay in BTC. If it's a small amount, like $30 or so, pretty much everyone I've offered has been curious enough about crypto to accept a small payment to a Coinbase account. After that, they tend to get interested.
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:07:40
In theory, sure. In practice, nobody knows shit about markets until they've had some skin in the game for a while. People aren't watching stock prices every day because they're just curious. I'm sure there are exceptions but there are worse ways to get started investing

I think there may only be 8 "models" that are representative of what's likely to succeed in the future in the blockchain space, like SEC-backed tokenized securities, BTC, a dApp platform, etc...
@_date: 2018-05-31 14:28:31
Because assets do not realistically hold at the top of price highs like we saw in December. It just so happened that futures were offered at the peak of an epic bull run. Not shorting would be a bad call in the short term. In the long run, shorters are going to feel pain. Mind you, we've seen consistently higher lows every month.

Thanks for this write\-up. I somewhat disagree with the idea that A.I. will solve our inability to accurately predict the future, but I think its ability to model the future will greatly improve our track record. I also find it fascinating how you articulated the relationship between fiat and cryptocurrencies in the future being somewhat symbiotic, which I agree with. I've never believed Bitcoin would replace fiat currency, but compliment it in a way that serves as a great tool for value preservation without the risks of counterfeiting that fiat, gold, and other assets have while simultaneously being transparent and global.

Possibly because USDT is providing a service that traditional banks refuse to provide in terms of conveniently moving money between exchanges, and an open audit of Tether accounts opens the door to further bank disruption and possible litigation by the issuing authority of the US dollar.

Do you have any evidence?
@_date: 2018-06-13 14:59:22

@_date: 2018-06-02 18:06:42
Ah, more Tether conspiracy nonsense. Tether only exists to circumvent traditional banks that refuse to facilitate large values of US dollars between exchanges for traders. Tether provides that capability and honestly the crypto community should be thankful they have offered this solution, which allows larger amounts of capital to be traded between exchanges for arbitrage and better price discovery. The fact that this article starts with the preface "\*This article should be considered to be nothing more than the authors opinion\*" should be taken into account when reading slanderous statements such as "\*Tether is Bogus, Undeniably\*." Well, if it's so "undeniable," why does the author feel the need to cover his ass when making such a baseless statement? Pure hit piece. Consider the source.

Its actually comical how uninformed and irresponsible MSM financial perspectives are on a regular basis and not just about BTC
@_date: 2018-06-02 19:08:57
I suggest you look into the purpose of each coin before investing. Is it intended to be used as a currency, or a token for a dApp platform, or is it a tokenized security? Once you understand what it's to be used for, ask yourself if it has legitimate community and developer support. Is it the leader in its area? Bitcoin is the one true currency in the crypto space. Prices tend to snowball based on the number of users on a network. Bitcoin has the network, so if you're interesting in buying a currency, Bitcoin is the one. There are other applications for blockchain tech. Personally, I'm more of a Bitcoin purist, but projects such as Ethereum may or may not end up providing value. Do your own research and be a critic.

The most intelligent people consistently win in every market. Expecting Bitcoin or anything of value to remain decentralized is a pipe dream. The most intelligent people will recognize value the fastest, accumulate it most efficiently, and keep it as part of their portfolio until there's a good reason to get rid of it. In other words, value in general centralizes around these people by default in a free market.

Bitcoin was created right after the US government literally defined undermining the US dollar with alternative currencies as a form of terrorism. Google it. If Satoshi sold any his coins for USD (then or now), he could have easily lost his anonymity and have suffered the same consequences as Bernard von NotHaus. The only thing he could do is wait for adoption and use his coins in anonymous, in-person peer-to-peer transactions some day in the future.

@_date: 2018-07-21 22:30:28
You contradicted yourself in your first paragraph. The reduced purchasing power over time makes dollars a bad store of value, but since the relative value of labor remains the same, you earn more dollars over time which allows you to pay off a loan principle sooner.
Deflationary currencies are a better store of value. Both have a purpose as I said before. QED

The thing is that jobs in new fields require more and more prerequisite learning, so you are correct in stating that there are more opportunities and new industries, but I think the future looks something more like a dense cluster of STEM-related disciplines producing products and services, a broader cluster of business-related roles such as operations, management, and accounting, and the even-broader sector of customer relations.
Outside of these fields, I can't find a reason for labor such as janitorial services, stockers, warehouse employees, or any type of low-education job that doesn't interface with a consumer being paid anything more than minimum wage. There are more than enough just-educated-enough people to fill these roles, and you are correct that the dollar is letting those people down, but I think that's a separate issue from the valuation of their work.

You should be able to sue for malpractice. You won't be able to with government-run healthcare.
Forcing everyone to purchase private healthcare will drive the price sky-high as insurance companies are now obligated to cover a slew of new pre-existing conditions.
Not to mention the *worst* part of your simple solution: Forcing everyone to buy healthcare means healthcare insurance companies can charge whatever they want, unless we force insurance providers to keep costs low.
I guess then we can create a whole new government agency to audit and regulate the healthcare sector.
You can also kiss innovation goodbye. The majority of innovators are right here in the US - free market working as intended (that is, until people who think "just making it mandatory" start electing nimrods to run things).
And when insurance costs $1,500 a month, we can just force business owners to pay everyone $20/hour, too.
See the pattern here? "Force."
Forcing people to do things is not only wrong, it doesn't work.

You are absolutely right, but I am optimistic that future regulatory framework will make Bitcoin more attractive. I think the most recent battery of crypto-related hearing at Congress and by the SEC in the US reinforce the idea that Bitcoin will be better regulated in the future

The problem with a Bitcoin reserve currency is that Bitcoin would be horrible for lending. This is the example I like to give: Imagine you borrowed BTC to buy a house in 2014. You paid for your house in BTC, and you owe 1% interest in your loan. As the price of BTC deflates, your ability to repay it gets smaller and smaller. That would be true slavery, like payday loans.
With two currencies, one deflationary, and one inflationary, we can use fiat for what it's good for (loans, investments, etc) and BTC for what it's good for (storing value, peer-to-peer payments).
One final point: The dollar valuation of the US stock market is what keeps it growing. If the absolute value of a stock stays the same, its dollar value will increase by the rate of inflation. This means everybody wins by the current rules - every dumbass who invests in an index fund gets an ROI. We pop this bubble that we're in, and there will be literal blood in the streets.

They don't need money from taxes. We had all of those services prior to having an income income tax.
Indefinite foreign wars and domestic surveillance operations need tax.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:40:10
America didnt have a federal income tax until 1913. People were "taxed" but only in the form of fees that were specific and proportional to the service rendered.
It is also not my opinion but objective fact that stealing things is wrong. Get out of here with those deontological ethics.
I get the sneaking suspicion you have not actually thought about any of the points I have presented, in favor of defending whatever belief you have about socialism. Take care.

I don't want people to disagree with me, I'd much rather prefer enough agreement that the public could demand a retrial for Ross. If someone is going to disagree with me, however, I'd much prefer an objective argument to ad hominems, and that was my only point.

Easy enough to find out. CMC has volume data

Institutions have not bought because their framework for buying is different from a retail buyer. We're talking about an asset that takes education, training, and new internal controls to prevent fraud, theft, hacks, etc. It's risky for more reasons than simply its volatility or volume. With custodial services and exchange traded funds, the ease of purchase and reduced liability will make purchase of actual Bitcoin more attractive.

Except funds are insured, and institutions dont risk insider theft, inadequite controls to prevent loss, etc. 
ETFs are not designed for you or I, they will be the business solution for institutions that desire bitcoin exposure without the liability of being personally accountable for it.

@_date: 2018-07-12 20:21:41
I dont think you do, either. Labor is worth less today, obviously. Labor is a commodity. If the dollar is responsible, than everything else should be losing value too. Except it isnt. If a thing has value, and the dollar devalues, the price of the commodity increases. It is as simple as basic division, though since you stooped to ad hominems, im finished explaining basics to you. Go complain about being poor to someone else.

I'm pretty sure you're at the point in the game where she jumps off a cliff. Also, kinda like Bitcoin ;)
Edit: If you like SNES, a game most people probably never played was Rudra no Hihou. It's probably the Square game with the best story, graphics, and music ever made for SNES, but it was released right before FF7 came out on PS1, so it was overlooked and never translated. There are fan translations now, though, and its deeeeefinitely worth a play-through.

I think you're seeing a dichotomy where there isn't one. Both of the following statements can be true:
1: The dollar has lost/is consistently losing value.
2: Labor has consistently decreased in value due to a greater work force (supply), efficiency, and automation.
Correct me if I'm wrong. They are independent of one another.
