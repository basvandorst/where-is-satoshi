I want to make a trading site items -&gt; cryptocurrencies and vice versa. There are npm modules that help you with using steam API but there's more customization to it and that's why I need someone to help out with that.

Why isn't using bitcoind a good idea? What are Block.io using?

The funny thing is that the main domain ( richard-elwell.com ) redirects to a site with title "Ethical Influence"

1) To accept trade offers and to tell the website API what items it accepted and from which Steam ID.
2) To send trade offers with items from its inventory to a given Steam ID and tell the website API when the user accepts the trade offer.

You can't pay with Bitcoin on Steam directly. That's the catch. The website will be the interface between Steam and Bitcoin. You pay with bitcoin and get items, or you sell items for bitcoins.

Thanks for the advice, maybe I'll try them. Though I still need someone to build the steam bot :D

Um... I'm not using third party for the coin transfer. That's not the case here. I want someone who can make a [Steam Bot]( for accepting and making trade offers on [Steam](

No, it's more like a donation tool similar to StreamLabs.

Looks great, but why Java?
