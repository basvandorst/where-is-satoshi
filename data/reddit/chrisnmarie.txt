Haven't lost any yet, bitconnect has been good to me
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:48:31
RIIGHT!!!, Not making that mistake again
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:48:35
I think so but this is if nothing major happens in a negative or positive way and the current trend continues, who knows where it goes if something happens.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:34:33
I need one of these shirts lol
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:23:44
 it's because I agree with this guy's chart
@_date: 2018-01-29 22:29:44
Android soon?
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:40:33
If you already have the BTC then no big deal IMO, but if you don't then yeah that sucks.
@_date: 2018-01-05 21:35:19
Just logged in with a message, that no more lending but withdraws are still open for Texas residents.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:21:05
It will only be 40k, do that remind me thing, you will see.

Hell, I bought stocks for a little while I had no idea you couldn't a stock.
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:01:18
I think that's a good idea but personally I am giving electroneum, maybe do some research and find a different coin that you feel has promise so that you can get a significant amount of coins for your son.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:46:53
You move it to the usd wallet and it sells it automatically i believe.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:46:51
Ok, i get it. The money really isn't backing it as much as the promise to buy it by the people that support it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:03:59
From a group i follow on telegram 
Based on the looks of it, BTC did some major retracement which also means its a good time to enter at its dips. Probably might dip to $13,000 before breaking out. Still very bullish on $BTC and is expecting it to hit $20,000 by the end of this month.
This retracement is pretty normal because BTC went up too much (due to overreaction from the futures listing) within a single week but do not worry if you are holding BTC. Just continue doing so as i foresee a bullish breakout within the next few days.
Meanwhile, if you have not entered $BTC, now is a good time to do so. However, do invest at your own risk and only invest in cryptocurrency what you can afford to lose (as it can be very volatile at times)
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:03:25
I like the way someone on here put it, you have to remember that the majority of BTC wallet owners have not been born yet.
@_date: 2018-09-07 07:45:54
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:10:20
5 years down the road I think they're both going to be significantly higher than they are now, to be honest I haven't done a lot of research but ethereum seems to be getting businesses on board and Litecoin it's all about the speed of their Network which as Bitcoin slows down could become popular as well but there are so many different choices the more risky you get the more coins you get long story short. One thing I can say is 80% of my purchases from a year ago you would have been profitable if I didn't spend or sell the coins.
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:29:13
Some kind of fork
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:07:01
You may have more return, no way to tell the future

Right, I totally agree with you I deal with the same issue in the IT world. It's really annoying when someone tells you I don't know why it's not working it was working fine yesterday, well no shit it's going to work fine until it doesnt, we're not going to be hacked until we're hacked so why wait around for that to happen when you can do things to attempt to prevent that from happening?
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:04:49
Introduced about 10 people this weekend who had no idea what it was and that it actually existed.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:28:28
Ehh Gains are gains right?
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:22:17
Sweet, so get ready for new ATH
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:08:33

If it is all legal this should be no problem.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:58:27
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:16:06
What bitcoin, no bitcoin here.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:23:32
I've had it take like 36 hours before so just give it time especially right now with so many people buying.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:16:37
Just buying BTC is like buying an Apple tree and just looking at the Apples forever but never trying one out
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:30:14
hell, see if you can meet in it?
@_date: 2018-08-13 19:58:36

This is my Oracle until it proves otherwise.
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:09:34
I caught it at 351
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:18:02
Yea, I work at a slow overnight tech job, so I'm watching it actively, climb baby climb
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:07:00
Riiight, I just got into it yesterday at 403  and now it's flying low
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:31:00
The last three hours has got me nauseous.
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:24:51
Got in yesterday for the first time at 404 then boom
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:55:47
Did it though?
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:42:25
Barely 24 hours, I'm ready...... I think
@_date: 2019-03-21 21:36:23
That would be amazing actually.
@_date: 2019-03-30 17:49:03
Makes me think Dungeons and Dragons
@_date: 2018-10-24 18:05:23
Nothing but a ride of regret over here :(
@_date: 2018-06-28 00:43:06
holy fuck that is some coin
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:39:00
Right, what kind of business owner cusses at potential customers. 
@_date: 2018-06-22 20:08:54
Well it was based on your actions.
@_date: 2018-06-22 19:56:32
Neither am I, now.
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:40:30
It was just there when i went to withdraw this morning, asked me a couple questions and then about 10 min later I was good to go.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:11:10
:( thought I had more time, I'm a dumbass, really sucks right now, I think I understand permabears now
@_date: 2019-02-02 00:20:00
 I sure hope this is a doctored image, like i tell people that have their kids showing, why would you want to let random people know how many kids you him. Why would want random people to know you have Bitcoin!!!
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:37:12
@_date: 2019-06-15 18:40:51
I assume you have to move it to cash
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:03:35
Look at coinmarket cap
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:41:24
It just sucks cause i used it for my small purchases like 20 bucks, to do sports betting.
@_date: 2019-02-08 14:58:45
You know what i bet i know what it was, I was using an overseas proxy for something and I probally logged into Coinbase while using it. I bet that is what happened.
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:37:16
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:04:12
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:56:40
What coins
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:28:11
Give me a minute, my phone is dead
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:21:21
Bitcoin is just a fad
@_date: 2019-06-15 16:37:02
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:01
Nope, its real already. It's called TittieCoin 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:21
Dude, there is almost literally a coin for everything you could think of lol 
@_date: 2019-04-09 12:27:22
There we go, bull runs can run without China bans

It's a Donut now, keep up man. /s  kinda sucks i have to put /s lol
@_date: 2018-02-15 08:59:34
Mind giving me your agent?
@_date: 2018-11-12 13:27:52
So the personification of Dreamcast controls us all?
@_date: 2018-03-11 03:35:22
If you are serious i would love to hear how this is achieved
 
@_date: 2019-01-28 15:55:34
This is what I was talking about yesterday, what if the Government started Crypto as a way to get people more invested in investing, and now they are gonna take it away and hope we slide over to traditional investments.
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:46:42
Just signed up and bought some, seems simple and low fees
@_date: 2019-01-27 01:52:22
If you are being serious, I would at least try to explain Bitcoin to her better, regardless don't put 40% of anything into BTC , like others have said, do less, if it keeps going down, then buy more later but dont go all in. Also, try to talk to her about crypto, not just bitcoin. Let her know the good things that are happening in countries that use it.
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:35:26
Well, I get page can not be displayed.
@_date: 2018-02-18 04:35:45

I didn't read it but it was one of the things that I seen last week that flat earthers are sayin
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:35:13
Nice try IRS
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:49:53
Got double charged and tired of their fees, been waiting 9 weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:00:59
RIGHT!! It's looks like we got rejected but it seems strong so we'll see
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:15:08
Sustaining now
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:20:42
I agree with you man but it will never happen and  this is why Bitcoin will one day have the same problem FIAT has, the majority of the wealth will be held by a small percentage that never spends it unless its in their best interest. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:50:49
Fix the link 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:03:52
I'm right there with you, dealing with double withdraw issues for Coinbase right now.
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:28:34
If this is real, that sucks, and congrats.
@_date: 2018-07-30 16:26:00
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:52:49
What is the current price at your market?
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:33:59
I mean it really depends on how bad you need the money cause BTC is going to rise the only question is when.  Remember you only lose if you sell.
@_date: 2018-02-11 01:57:13
2? lol that's cute. It's been at least a month over here.
@_date: 2018-07-18 22:42:23
Awesome man
@_date: 2018-07-03 19:25:07
No clue, but i do know from a tech standpoint, you can set a file to launch once a USB is connected so I assume if that file contained a batch file that did what you want, it could work.
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:53:57
Hahaha i thought that said Poop Livestream
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:28:37
Shhh dont say nothing
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:27:49
The problem is... once the community realized no coins are being dropped on this hard fork, BCASH is going down.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:50:10
