It starts off not so bad, then it gets so bad.

Don't respond so negatively so quickly. You know, with the whole "shitbreath" thing. Go outside, and take a break from reddit. You just kept swearing through that entire post.
Is that really mature behavior? Really?

I assume that ROI is an acronym which has words that when put together mean "made their worth back." How about this? I just like bitcoin, I think it is really cool, and have followed it since bitcoins were worth a few dollars. I did not think it would get this far, and now that it has, I really want to get into it, even though I won't make any money from it. I support it for what it is.

what is an ASIC?

Well, they only make the stuff once it is ordered, so if they were to offer refunds they would lose money when they refund a product. This is extremely bad and could and likely would kill them as a company. If they had a hundred units get refunded, which wouldn't be unlikely due to the general ignorant/ overly extreme hatred being spewed at them (the kind that prevented the xbox from becoming the console version of steam, but better). Basically, shut it, because you aren't thinking of any side but your side.

Where the hell can you get these things?

I like your answer, but it seems like they might require the "interest free loans" that they have already gotten.
Giving refunds would certainly help attitudes towards them and make them much more stable in the long term. 
Your point about the auction pricing suggests that they should make jalapenos first and sell them after, and they would make even more money, so refunding one would be no issue whatsoever.
I wonder where all the money they took in fucking went?
Perhaps they are in dire straits due to bad spending or something like that, or perhaps he is just an asshole, or he just doesn't want to deal with it whatsoever.

You are getting into a pointless argument., but not really. Just need to avoid altercations on the internet.. Either that or you need to go outside and/or do something relaxing that doesn't involve a screen.

really? eight cents? You are complaining about eight cents? How often are you transferring bitcoins?

BFL is a small business. They don't have the money to make thousands of their product and then sell them. Therefore they only build something when they have received the money for it. If you refund your order, then they have lost money. If they have to refund a lot of orders, they lose a lot of money, causing significant harm to them as a business. They don't have the ability to absorb those losses. It would also be a great way for someone or a group of people (like a group of angry asshats or a competitor) to destroy them.
