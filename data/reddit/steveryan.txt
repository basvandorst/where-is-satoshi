Your comment is bringing a tear to my eye. The paper used to be over twice as long and assumed the reader is a complete beginner at maths, cryptography, etc. Unfortunately I learned the hard way that I need to backup my files more often, so this is an older, less fluffy version. 
I agree with everything you said. Thanks for your comments.

Sometimes I think ECC was some sort of weird mathematician joke. You know, "Let's try to make the most complicated thing ever". And here we are, we fell for it. :)

Keep reading, I explain a lot of the concepts in later sections. :) It's hard to explain ECC so I tried to introduce things bit by bit. My apologies if this has made it harder to read.
When you're finished I'll answer any questions you have.

I wrote it for It's not being shared or submitted anywhere else, so I thought a simple PDF should be acceptable.
You're right though. Just getting the ECC concepts down on paper is difficult, so I didn't spend a lot of time thinking about how best to format it. In hindsight I can see it could be prettier.

Sure, go for it.

It would be better if it were in LaTeX, you're right. If I do another version in the future I'll consider changing format.
