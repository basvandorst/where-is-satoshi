What about the ALS foundation? I lost my father back in July to a rare form of ALS. They just do not have nearly enough research on ALS in general let alone the rare forms of it. He only lasted six months from diagnosis. I moved them into my house and took best care of him as I could to make him comfortable but there literally was nothing that anybody could do. The form of ALS that he had was called bulbar onset.
There is no treatment no nothing that they can do. Once you’re diagnosed with ALS it’s just about making yourself as comfortable as possible until the inevitable comes.

Yes, you're locked in at that price. 
If you purchased 1.05941339 LTC you will get 1.05941339 LTC in your wallet regardless of what price does, no profit and no loss (LTC-wise). Obviously if LTC goes up or down in price during that time your 1.05941339 LTC will be worth more or less than when you purchased it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:58:01
Note that you can transfer money and BTC from Coinbase to GDax for free and instantly. GDax has way lower fees. 0.25% vs 1.5%. Best to purchase on GDax if you have money waiting to be used. Downside is you can’t instantly purchase like you can on Coinbase. 
Another option is Gemini. Same 0.25% fees and let’s you transfer in $500 per day and purchase instantly. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:01:23
Yeah at that point I wouldn’t get a hardware wallet. I own multiple thousands worth. Makes sense for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:56:36
No. It’s not possible. 12 words is a phrase to a wallet, NOT your private key. The moneys gone unfortunately. That’s the beauty of BTC. No chargebacks. 
I sympathize though.

It's back. It was for about 2-3 hours time (of course during the busy little correction) but nonetheless it is back now.
I always prefer to buy on Gemini as it's sometimes upwards of 2-3k cheaper. When I sell, it's on GDAX.

Coinbase is a good place to start. Easy and fast to get in. They own GDax so visit GDax.com and use Coinbase credentials to log in. Can transfer money there from bank too and only pay 0.25% fees when buying.

Nope. I'm in same boat. Mines at like 4+ hours. I've seen it take as long as 12-14 hours before.

Get off Coinbase is how you minimize fees. They are not an exchange. They are a bank. They do own GDax though which is an exchange. You can xfer from Coinbase to GDax free. Then GDax to Trezor free. Also GDax feees for trading are .25% where Coinbase is 1.5% to 3% (bank or CC).

Only with Coinbase. Just transfer it for free from Coinbase to GDax then from GDax to you wallet.

No coins are ever held in the wallet which is why you can delete and re-add them. Only the keys are on the wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:49:28
Yeah you’re fine getting it off of Amazon. I’d say there or Ledger only. They aren’t really hackable as sending from them requires a physical button push. That can’t be done by hacking. Also note that it does not actually store your bitcoin ether litecoin etc. it only stores your private key. That way if you accidentally lose it or it breaks you can use your 24 word phrase to restore it at any time on a new device. Also typing in the incorrect passcode open it three times or more will automatically erase it. He would then need to use your 24 word phrases to restore it again. It also does not need to be powered on at all in order to receive things to it. You just need to have the public key that is on it. You only need to ever turn it on if you’re going to send things off of it. It’s very secure.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:58

@_date: 2017-12-03 03:00:50
That's because they own that private key, not you. In theory they own the BTC, not you. That's why folks use paper or hardware wallets because then they own the private keys.

And? They still transfer off for no fee. Just stating a fact. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:21:24
I'd recommend using an actual exchange. Two good ones are Gemini or GDAX (owned by Coinbase). You can set limit or stop (only with GDAX, Gemini doesn't do stop orders) orders with them to sell at a set point for you. Or you can market sell. The money does not go right into your bank, it goes into your USD account with whatever service you're using. Then you transfer it to your bank via wire or ACH (4-5 days).
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:50:17
Coinbase owns GDAX. Gdax is an exchange (MUCH lower fees and live pricing) while Coinbase is a broker (higher fees and not live pricing). If you have anything on coinbase you can transfer it for free to gdax. Just go to gdax.com and use the same coinbase credentials to log in.
My weekly limit is $10k currently but I can request more.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:05:38

@_date: 2017-12-23 23:03:47
To be fair GDAX also allows you to withdraw for no fees. The downside some may see that is coin base owns GDAX. If you have a beef with Coinbase you probably don’t want to use GDax . Although GDax is an actual exchange, coin base is just a broker/bank. Two totally different items.
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:16:20
There are a few ways to do this really:
* Coinbase: They are NOT an exchange. Fees are 1.5% via ACH or 3-4% via CC. You can set up automatic buys weekly with them. It's convenient because you don't have to have any money with them, but you're paying the 1.5% fee due to that.
* GDAX: Owned by Coinbase. Fees are 0.25%. You can ACH or Wire ($10 fee) into your account. You would then hold that USD in your account with them and buy off that. It takes 4-5 days for the money to clear into your account so it's not really great for capturing dips in the market.
* Gemini: You can wire or ACH into them. The limit on ACH is $500 /day. The difference here is that the ACH money is made available to you immediately. The downside is you only get $500/day. The fees are same as GDAX for the most part, 0.25%.
I'm sure there are other exchanges, brokers, etc. out there, but I don't use them so can't comment on them.
If you want to buy in the dips, the best way to do so is using Coinbase ACH (1.5% fee - don't have to keep the USD with them, can buy immediately) or holding USD in GDAX or Gemini (0.25% fee) and buying in dips. If you just want to buy a set amount each week, regardless of pricing, then you're better off doing ACH transfer into GDAX or Gemini for that amount and then purchasing as the fees are only 0.25%.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:55:07

@_date: 2017-12-11 18:52:22
Well you can leave it in an exchange and it’ll tell you your portfolios worth. Although if investing $1000+ total and $400 /month you should get a paper wallet or hardware wallet. That’s a lot to keep in an exchange online in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:38:15

@_date: 2017-12-03 01:37:50
In my opinion if you have a couple hundred dollars you’re probably fine keeping it on one of the Coinbase wallets or a site very similar. If you have any more than that I really suggest investing in hardware wallet like a ledger. That way you’re safe if any of those sites become hacked. It’s happened in the past already, and I highly doubt that was the last time will ever occur.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:22
Probably weeks. They are having a terrible time right now.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:32:03
It was a response to a comment, not in general. I just commented incorrectly. But he specifically asked how to prevent a loss. In that case, this advice is NOT terrible, but very good. 
In the grand scheme of things he shouldn't be investing with money he can't lose anyways.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:01:22

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:19:31
I know right haha. I'm about to buy some on Gemini as it's 2k cheaper than GDAX. The issue is the transfer will take probably 6-12 hours to occur since GDAX has degraded services past 3-4 days.

No, Coinbase isn’t an exchange. That’s my point. Don’t keep anything with them. Guess I wasn’t clear enough. But it’s legit not an exchange. That’s the thinking that makes people lose money in fees. I agree 100% with everything else you said and was trying to get that across but did it poorly. I just assumed when I said it wasn’t an exchange but a bank (it’s really just a broker) I was implying don’t trust it. Obviously that was a poor assumption.

Sorry i don’t have the answer but do you mind if I ask why? Just curious the reasons people transfer back (other than the obvious of selling). Is that the intentions?
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:09:00
This title is super misleading. It’s one exchange. Not all of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:15:29
I guess that's the case with software wallets? Because transferring from an exchange to a hardware wallet and back is 0 fees.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:14:24
This is correct. Limit you put 10200. If it never hits that then you never buy. If you want 10 at that price and only 1 becomes available then you purchase 1 and 9 you never buy. 
Buying at market is immediate. You want 10, you get all 10. But there are seconds that occur between the purchase and if he coin fluctuates a little during that time, so be it. You get it at the fluctuation not the price you saw when you clicked buy. Could be a couple dollars or more. 
Coinbase is NOT an exchange. And they have higher fees. They are easy though. I wanted some bitcoin fast when i decide to buy in so I used them. Super easy. Did ACH for the 1,5% vs 3% on CC. That was first and only time I’ll use them. I didn’t know any better. I now use GDax (owned by Coinbase but an exchange and has .25% fees and Gemini (not related to Coinbase at all, also an exchange, also has .25% fees). 
What I like better about Gemini is I prefer to use ACH to fund my account. Lowest fees. Ok GDax that takes 4 days before I can use that money. On Gemini they let me use the money immediately even though it won’t clear for 2-4 days. 
I also purchased a hardware wallet to store my coin. When i bought in I didn’t just do $50. I did an amount that makes me uncomfortable leaving it in an online wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:33:47
This is all for buying bitcoin. I’ve never actually sold any I only buy. Cc is credit card. You can purchase immediately but pay 3% fees. ACH is bank transfer. Takes a couple of days to put your money into Coinbase but the fee is only 1.5%. 
If you use an actual exchange which Coinbase is not the fees are much lower most of them are 0.25%

@_date: 2017-11-29 00:04:06
So do you just keep cash in the exchange waiting to buy? Since deposits take 2-3 days time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:04:19
Something like the Ledger Nano S.
So for example, I'm rather new to BTC. But when I bought in, it was with thousands of dollars. I'm not going to trust Coinbase with that, so I transferred my BTC to my hardware wallet (the Ledger Nano S). In laymen terms, it's a jump drive that houses your BTC securely that you hold onto. It's more complicated than that, but that's the jest of it.

It’s normal. Need to verify. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:21:05
None that are quite as straightforward. Gemini is an exchange. Takes about 2 days to verify as they are backed up. Let’s you purchase the quickest of the exchanges I’ve found. 
GDax is Coinbase. Prob won’t work if you can’t verify on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:56:14
No they’re actually exact opposite of each other.
Limit: to make money
Trade at a price equal to or better than a certain price. For buy orders, buy at $X or lower. For sell orders, sell at $X or higher.
Stop: to prevent loss
Trade if price moves beyond the desirable target. For sell orders, sell if price falls below $X. For buy orders, buy if price climbs above $X.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:27:36
Yeah. Fees were just way to high. I did some as a ACH as it was only 1.5%. Just got verified on Gemini where fees are much lower and only 2 day waiting. Not nearly as user friendly though so I have some learning/reading to do. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:23:13
Ah. Yeah. Much higher fees though. Think I’ll just put some in Gemini and have it when I need it. Or GDax. .25% is much better than 1.5% or 3%. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:16:36
Also sound financial choices. You have no clue what their goals are. What happens if it crashes tomorrow? Just because you don’t think it will doesn’t mean it won’t. 
Nothing wrong with selling now if it makes financial sense for you. Most people don’t care about BTC as a currency. They care about it as a stock.

Just lets me buy in more if we go lower haha. I originally bought in at 9,900 for first time. I'm gonna HODL like the best of them though.

Direct quote from her: 
Thanks for the feedback.  We have made a deliberate choice recently to give up on applying more band-aids in favor of accelerating development of the new platform.  I know that sucks but there are only bad and worse choices here.  Support were intentionally told to give no ETA because anything (like random, surprise hard forks every other day) could delay the upgrade.  I would not ask anyone to stick it out.  There are other decent exchanges out there.  I'd prefer you take your business elsewhere for a while, save yourself some frustration, and give us another chance later.  Good idea on updating the blog.

Bank transfer. It’s ACH. Unless you wired it. It’s same day.

For lower amounts I'd think it's fine. If you have a decent amount invested (say a few thousand or more) I would probably get yourself a hardware wallet.

Ugh. Me too. Screw selling I wanted to buy more!

A stop order is in order that you place a set amount on and you will sell your stock when it reaches that amount. It’s really used to try to prevent losing money on the investment. If you bought in the bit coin 9000 you could set a stop order for 9500 and if bitcoin ever drops to 9500 again you’ll sell which will guarantee you a $500 profit. It’s essentially the lowest price you’re willing to go on the stock without selling. 
The downfall is that if it hits 9500 today you sell, but then it jumps right back to 10000 30 min later you have to pay 10000 to get back in.

Not really. You purchase and it’s “instant” but still holds for 5-7 days with them.

That’s not single people though. That’s huge quantities of smaller amounts.

Kraken has been having loads of issues for awhile now. I never used them and just got in but in my research that’s what I’ve read. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:49:09
That’s how it works with ACH. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:27:11
That won’t be the peak.

It’s 3% on credit card. I invested more than $50 and fees were high because of that. I’d rather pay .25% in fees.

Gemini is down too

Honestly those are the only 2 I use that offer that feature. Not many give you free withdraws and pay the tx fees for you.
