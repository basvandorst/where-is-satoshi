There's only enough room for two stickies on the sub, my guess is that the big announcement about the bug/0.16.3 being *REQUIRED* is seen as more important than the daily discussion.
At the same time, I guess the second one (The Baltic Honeybadger) has an agreement with the mods so no space for the daily discussion today. You can search for it though, it does exist, it's just not stickied.

Why BIP49?
@_date: 2018-05-20 10:47:27
Read the bip39 spec, specifically this bit:


@_date: 2018-05-20 12:22:06
Does anyone have a list of all the words?
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:37:51
That's why I said they were playing, but they did send $500...
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:59:51
If it's a seed go to the bip39 generator [here]( or import it into [something like this]( (Click "skip" then "Validate or Decrypt" in the top right corner) if it's an actual private key. You'll need to sweep it quickly if you actually got it though, as these generators are all online.
To sweep it install Electrum, input the private key there and send it to your own wallet. You can also just go straight for Electrum, import the private key you think you found or create a standard wallet from the words.
@_date: 2018-05-20 12:40:18
Right now I'm searching the white paper if I have a hunch... but yeah, real helpful if we could get that list from someone :P
@_date: 2018-05-13 09:52:56
And this is nothing new either, this was always happening. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 13:15:57
All of them, not just the BIP39 ones.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:21:37
Already been through this, I think it's more in relation the position of the words (bottom right of the circle)
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:05:54
It's impossible to bruteforce in that way, it would take millions of years.
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:52:24
If you've found it, prove it by typing your words into Electrum and getting the money.
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:09:01
It's not, *even if you knew* the exact 24 words you need but not the order they're in, it would take you almost 200 years of trying 100 trillion times per second.
See here: 
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:52:46
root &amp; lost not in the word list.

So, I'm noticing patterns. Some of these words aren't in the BIP39 list, but very similar ones are, I've marked the similar ones with brackets.






































@_date: 2018-05-20 10:57:26
Ah yes, there it is... I'm trying to look at this from the whitepaper rather than the image... see if there's a pattern to the clues, but nothing yet.

I need sleep
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:55:19
Of course they can... if you type your own seed in the wrong order or an incorrect word the resulting wallet is empty, you've just created a new one. Now imagine if you had 24 words.
@_date: 2018-05-20 06:09:39
If you sign it but don't touch the money, people will keep trying to figure it out to actually move the money. Otherwise anyone can claim they solved it, I can claim I solved it too

OUTPUT: I solved the puzzle. You have 24 hours before I get the btc out, good luck!
Anyone care to actually sign from this address? :P
He also sent 0.05 BTC, which is over $500 right now.
Edit: Sorry I'm a dumbass, been at this puzzle too long and it's late. He did not send the 0.05 to the prize address.
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:25:48

Use Electrum, download it, set up a standard wallet, say you have the seed words, go to 'options' and tick bip39, then type in the words you have.
You can also try in the bip39 tool
@_date: 2018-05-23 06:38:14
this TX I think: 
The main prize went to the old address but there was 0.00212121 also going somewhere else - however I've been looking at the address it went to, the TX, everything. Not had any luck yet.
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:50:26
The seed has to be a certain amount of words, 11 isn't one of them. It could be 12, but then the 13th would be the passphrase.
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:23:35
The random phrases just make a private key, which is a wallet. The number of private keys that can be made from the phrases is astronomically large. If you're trying to recover your own wallet and have 23 words for it and need the last, that's 2048 possible attempts, easy. 
* If you have 22 and 2 are unreadable, it'd be  4 million possible combinations. 
* If you had 21 and 3 are unreadable it'd be over 8 billion possible combinations.
You see how it gets exponentially harder? You have no chance of stumbling onto an actual wallet unless you know at least 22 of their seed words. 
The wallets you do find are empty, because all wallets are empty by default.
@_date: 2018-08-28 02:58:56

Of course it is... if you type your own seed in the wrong order or an incorrect word the resulting wallet is empty, you've just created a new one. Now imagine if you had 24 words.

Here's my best guess, sadly not correct, I'm still playing with it. But here's what I think OP meant by think in pairs


Some of these are not on the picture, but similar words (found/find) are. Avoid trust I'm almost certain is correct.
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:47:20
Oh aye, sorry... I should have seen that, it's getting late here.

UPDATE: My cat thinks she has the answer, but can only meow.
EDIT: Nevermind, I think she was just hungry.
@_date: 2018-05-20 11:39:07
The rest? You download Electrum, tell it to create a standard wallet, say you have the seed words, put the words in and you're done. If it says there's 1 BTC in it then you're good, if not then you're incorrect.
If by chance you do have it, let me know ;)
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:35:12
People just don't like airing their financial history around the place, if I bought from a certain exchange or bought a server from a company I don't really want that airing as it could identify me if either of those companies are hacked.
That's why change addresses and deterministic wallets exist in the first place.
@_date: 2018-05-14 13:33:51
Most sites will support everywhere, it's a default... why would any site cut off a lot of potential revenue by only supporting one region when they can happily support the world without much extra work?

It wasn't me, just to clarify. Just saw the TX while I'm working on it...
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:05:07
Yeah...stand back and you start seeing a lot of this, "longest based proof", "current rules save power", "without trust", "making controlled computational based proof", "physical financial value cant ever work"
I think the message is more Anarchist in nature, going back to the foundations of BTC. 
I think the pairs refer to the fact some words are not directly in BIP39, but perhaps similar words would be. based=base for example.
@_date: 2018-05-20 18:19:56
You download Electrum, tell it to create a standard wallet, say you have the seed words, put the words in and you're done. If it says there's 1 BTC in it then you're good, if not then you're incorrect. Remember to click bip39 in the options.

@_date: 2018-05-21 13:25:07
OP was asking how to [generate a specific seed]( about a week ago, it wasn't autogenerated. He also said the seed will make sense when we see it.
You an easily recover whatever words you want and send BTC to it, as long as it's a valid seed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:03:00
Perhaps, what are you thinking? 
@_date: 2018-05-21 01:16:53
How did we find this question? This account?
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:35:54
Yes, I asked this before as well.
They used [this]( one rather than the one on bitcoin.org
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:37:14
Yeah he should, that's why I asked if anyone cares to actually sign from the address. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 00:27:21


Or people are just using a new address because they don't want their financials to be traced?
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:45:30
Move the money or sign a message from the address
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:33:54
It's still here, I'm not sure what you're seeing?
It was moved several hours ago by OP from the older address to this one.
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:19:40
You're looking for either a private key *or* a seed, most likely a seed of 12 or 24 words.
@_date: 2018-05-22 03:58:31
They didn't say that, it's just all the words in the image are also on this whitepaper in the credits, including John &amp; Sons etc.
@_date: 2018-05-20 16:57:20
Here's what I got, if anyone can help me with these two clues that would be real helpful.
* Lost transaction costs almost users
* 00212121
I've taken what he's said in all comments, I think the image is a distraction:
* give try (try give?) 
* copy left 
* code easily
* attack early
* almost open
Valid bip39 but not the seed, sadly:


@_date: 2018-05-22 18:48:51
Yes, 
this TX I think: 
The main prize went to the old address but there was 0.00212121 also going somewhere else - however I've been looking at the address it went to, the TX, everything. Not had any luck yet.
@_date: 2018-05-20 05:57:02
Prove it, either sign a message from the wallet or move the money.
@_date: 2018-05-22 04:16:49
Nope 
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:18:03
You don't need verification on most places that aren't exchanges, there's more out there than regulated KYC places. 
@_date: 2018-05-21 09:46:34
That first message was strange enough that I took all the BIP39 words from that and tried to get them into a valid BIP39 nmumonic, unfortunately didn't work.
"Hidden in plain sight" hidden &amp; sight are seed words and are a pair. But they aren't in the image, so I'm not sure.
@_date: 2018-05-22 18:44:36
He just wants to know if they're valid, not if they have the address. Although a few mods to that python script should do it I think...
This line is pretty much all he needs

Hah, good luck. It was probably a stolen account on the exchange so you're not going to get anything there, and if the repo host is Github they won't give you anything without a court order.

@_date: 2019-02-05 21:42:38
But you don't merely see where it came from, you see the balance of the user's wallet, you see the change address so you can follow money and work out where your client visits next, you can link their previous purchases etc
And if someone pulls money from my bank account I call the bank and get it reversed.

Yeah I wouldn't resubmit it now, due to how political the issue has got I believe consensus among the devs wouldn't make it tenable to bring it up again for years at least (and who can be arsed with politics, I'm a dev, not a politician)
There was a downside I thought of and tried to implement against, basically the miners would always go for the most expensive TX's (of course, but these are emergency measures if the backlog has got too large, so we need a different approach right?) - the original 1MB block was up to the miner but my design for the larger block was if you mined a block with increased size the overflow (anything beyond the 1MB) had to be max fee/m, m being the avg fee in the mempool

LN is to make sure that when the next bull run comes, we still have something that functions when the entire blockchain grinds to a halt again. (I do think there should have *also* been efforts to increase the blocksize to make sure it didn't grind to a halt, but I do believe LN can do good things here)

*Bitcoin mining
Other currencies have already seen that and gone to different proofs. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 16:22:34
It can be calculated, each block has a reward that goes to the miner of the block. You'd take every block and add the mining reward (for the first 4 years it was 50 BTC, for the second 25 BTC etc) to get a total which should be around 17,370,937

No doubt, I just know his next move will be to come here and likely praised by people who hat(ed) BCH. 
He will run the same thing, BCH is a test run for this guy.

Beautiful thing about open source, if you don't have time any developer can add his own indicators and push them back to you. You don't owe anything to anyone asking for more indicators :)

Uh... a block every 10 minutes means 3 confs would take 30 minutes?

No worries, try a privacy coin like Monero/Zcash/Dash if your deep web vendor accepts it, most will.

He's gone, so yeah... It's was, no longer here. Whether he's dead or just a dead alias for someone still alive doesn't matter.

Also the fees on these things are usually astronomical.

As someone who does *not that much* trading monthly, perhaps 10-20k USD... bisq looks very low volume, absolutely no CNY (Chinese Yuan) buys/sells when there's a very healthy market on LBC which I use a lot, the only market that even has a slight bit of liquidity is USD....
Edit: And before you say I can start putting ads, my business involves fast liquidity... I'm happy to pay someone else the margin for the trade.

What makes Wasabi better? Is it trustless?

a... coinbase wallet... for deep web purchasing? Do you want your accounts locked and sent to the govt instantly because that's how you do it.
Do the smart thing, download something like Electrum and put your BTC there. Make sure the BTC there is not linked to your coinbase either.

I actually like latte haha
It doesn't grind to a halt but it does get very expensive - I had a proposal 2-3 years ago (before blocksize was a huge debate) that got rejected for dynamically increasing the blocksize as needed, triggering some code in bitcoind if the mempool is over a certain amount which would allow any miner (or pool) who accepts the measure with an option in the config to temporally mine larger blocks. The idea was it would be recalculated every 512 blocks (there could be 4 blocksize changes within each difficulty change)
It would have really helped IMO in December with a huge uptick and backlog, the issue was just compounded until it got ridiculous, once the backlog was finally cleared fees went to a normal level again. Just reminded me that had my proposal been accepted we would have cleared the backlog quickly then readjusted back (again, this wasn't a hugely contentious issue back then, no politics attached)

Keep a close eye on the SV code as well, he could sell a move of the original Satoshi coins on the SV chain as a proof to mainstream media - they'd buy it before anyone could refute it. 
Would do a huge amount of damage before the truth was known.

Not sure, but I've seen a few highly prominent members of the crypto community fall to this.
Weed is pretty common, not too harmful in itself but I've seen 20 million dollars stolen from creators because they weren't careful with hardware wallets or seedwords, I've seen them go bragging to the people selling them drugs and drinks and their girls and even their cleaners about who they are.
It's a shame, because you search this one dude online and he's a genius and extraordinary, has a shitload people following and respecting everything he does. People wonder where he's gone and say he's developing the next big thing, anyone comes and goes "Hang on" and they're shot down... and it's funny, because that dude, whoever he is, is right.
Meh, I probably said too much, you see I'm jaded :')

That's what I meant, you'd have to take it off the black bit to use the metal bit properly though or it'd be awkward as fuck. 
Although my metal bit is very loose for some reason, if it has a tighter grip I think it'd work.
@_date: 2018-07-15 05:57:36
That could work if you take the metal bit off... guess you've done this before?

It's a recurring theme for some reason. A few drugs and some hookers is all good, but these people have one good idea, strike rich then go down this path of losing it all.
I'm a sysadmin/occasional dev/janitor - work in this space and it'll open your eyes.

Looks a lot like a pyramid, where those early people make the most out of it... oh wait.
@_date: 2018-07-15 13:28:10
People generally have to work and shit, don't really have time or money for drugs and girls. Once you get a bit rich you can afford some of the finer things and with that comes high class girls and very good drugs.
It's very different from the drugs and girls you and me could get. People who have suddenly found money like this will generally go a bit wild.

Well that was stupid, Ledger even specifically advise NOT to do that.
Never take a photo of your words, and never put it on an online device, you were pretty much asking to get hacked.

It took an hour for a block to be mined the other day... was a pain as I was waiting for a TX :(

A lot of cryptos do have 0-conf/instant transactions though, Dash and Nano being the ones I can think of from the top of my head. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:20:38
That's interesting but surely the seller then has all the power? You can't force the release of the coins to the buyer even if he's paid in fiat and the seller has vanished?
@_date: 2018-04-17 05:18:24


Uh... then how do they move the coins from the seller to the buyer? I'm confused.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:00:02
But the crypto personality drama affects the price of my investment, I don't want my investment to go down 30% because Craig decided to attack BCH again next year.

So I have to pay more because some dumb fuck is spamming the chain?

It takes 72 hours to withdraw your BTC to a wallet on your computer? The fuck? Why does anyone use coinbase? 
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:40:55
Alright so bear with me here... If I supported a block size increase to 2MB right now, where would you tell me to go?
@_date: 2018-12-19 02:17:23
LBC doesn't have a premium that large if you're dealing in a high volume country, in China for example its close to spot.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:29:22
And my hardware wallet? There's two major companies, I wouldn't trust anything else with my coins
And are there alternatives to localbitcoins with high liquidity that support LN? I've never seen one - I did ask LBTC about LN a while ago and they said they don't support it yet, maybe soon, but all companies say that and it was last year with no progress.
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:49:18
Yeah the issue is that blocksize has now become political football with BCH, the custiodians/devs of BTC will never accept a fork with 2MB now
I don't listen to or follow crypto "personalities" and drama so I have no interest in BCH at all
LN needs time for people to evaluate and adopt, in the meantime BTC should consider an increase
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:21:31
The issue I'm having with LN is my hardware wallet doesn't support it, neither do the exchanges I use nor localbitcoins - so I have no choice but to do onchain
When will we see real world usage of LN?
