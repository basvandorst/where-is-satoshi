You have the chance 24 hours a day. Bitcoin is a mathematical currency, so you can buy an extremely small amount with little to no transaction fees.
What's holding you back is price discovery - nobody has a clear picture of what bitcoin is worth. If people did know what it was worth, there would be no money made on trading it. Some people are getting rich because they are deciding what level of risk they are comfortable with and putting their hairy ones up on the table.
Find an amount that won't break your heart if it's gone. Get experience in how to buy, how to store, etc. In the meantime, park some real money in a cash account that waits for opportunity. By dipping a toe, you'll get a better idea of the day to day rhythm. You'll develop your own sense of where good buying and selling points are.
This isn't for everyone. Some people always sell low on bad news then buy high trying to chase it. Know thyself. If this is you, this is not for you. In bitcoin, every Tuesday is Black Tuesday and the rest of the week is the roaring 20s. This is a good thing.

"200 BTC" and "telling my wife" should rarely be in the same sentence

Good plan. I bought for the first time about six weeks ago. Price was close to the  high - just under $4400. At the time it felt like the last man at the party. BTC is over $8000 today - this party only getting started.
You are going to be fine - put your ear on the railroad tracks. Hear that sound? It's the herd that is coming.

I have found that if I cannot explain a complex concept in a manner that is easy to understand for the layman, then I don't really understand the concept as well as I should.
So you are on the right track - seek more knowledge. You need to be able to explain what it is and why it's  a benefit without getting too far into the esoteric technical weeds on the one hand, and without a lot of ungrounded hand-waving on the other.
I have found that Andreas Antonopoulos is masterful at educating people on the subject.
