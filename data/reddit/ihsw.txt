Fixing socioeconomic conditions shouldn't be the responsibility of individual account holders. If they want to move their money then they should be free to do so without interference.
We shouldn't even have to resort to such drastic actions, the ineptitude of the Greek government got us here. The Greek people have lost faith in their banks and their governments, that is the issue here. Fix that and there wouldn't be bank runs.

Who created that debt black hole?
If I take out a loan for $100M and I have a long history of being aggressive, defensive, and evasive with my creditors, and I don't have solid account managers on staff to help me plan, track, and spend that money -- am I really in any position to complain when I get cut off?
They had their chance to make that money work when they got it the first time (and with every debt extension and debt lifeline), and now that chance is gone. Now the black hole is too big, and it's time to let them try things on their own.
Now it's time to let the Greek people decide for themselves whether they want to hang their leaders out in the streets for letting things get so bad, or eat the shit sandwich that Tsipras and Varoufakis have served them.

It's just like investing in other foreign currencies -- investing in currencies involves risks and this is especially true during volatile times (ie: now). The advantage compared to other means of investment is that currency trading operates on a 24-hour basis and it responds to real world events.
[Investopedia]( has a nice page on investing in foreign exchanges and much of it applies here (except the part where margins are limited to 1% since exchange rates move so slowly, quite the opposite in the case of BTC).

It makes sense. Self-fulfilled retirement is a relatively new concept in humanity, and in the past you had to rely on family members since you became too old to work.
The rationale is that your parents raise your children while you are working, and it works quite well (I speak from experience). You don't have to worry about daycare or hiring neighbours by the hour.
The way it goes is you save your money for a home very early (home ownership is highly regarded in Asian cultures) and when your parents become too old to work then they move in with you.
Granted there's a sense of self-entitlement in the elderly (they planned for this, just like you are planning for your children to take care of you) and it puts an enormous amount of stress on the finances, so frugality and secrecy with money is not uncommon.

Yes, you will get that kind of return, but so will everybody else. The more people are mining, the less of a return you'll get over time (-10% return every month, for example).
Generally just like computer technology there's a serious bump in processing power every 18 months so you'll need to re-invest in lock-step to remain ahead of the curve. As things get a little more competitive then maintaining your edge will be harder and harder.

Modern fiat currency isn't about taxes, it's about doling out insane loans to under-privileged nation states that cannot pay it off (why? for infrastructure like transportation and communication networks) and then strong-arming them when they can't pay it off.
This maintains a sort of international feudalism where nations are beholden to others, a very odd sort of slavery where nations are forced to get involved in political football at the expense of your citizenry (eg: being forced to take out loans to build large malls that sell foreign products).
Clamping down on 'tax evasion' is a convenient smoke-screen meant for PR purposes.
I'm sure you're wondering, why can't this work with BTC or any other fixed-supply currency? Because the loans provided to these under-privileged nation-states are financed by fiat currency created on-demand.

Trade on the 200-day simple-moving average and you'll see better margins than most other things that operate on a 200-day basis.
If you have the patience to buy and sell on a moment's notice then more power to you, otherwise stick to getting your ducks in a row only once or twice a year.

Your small and personal opinion isn't basic high school econ. I acknowledge that economic theory has value and that it absolutely applies here but your confused and backwards interpretations of what's going on doesn't help anybody.

No, Bernanke and co. laugh heartily at BTC. They'd happily claim that the patrons exchanging USD for BTC were swindled.

Gotta take the bitter with the sweet, this is the nature of reality. In times like this we can't afford to be idealistic, pragmatism requires compromise.

I don't see how it's pedantry, the concept of keeping backups for your savings is very awkward.

This right here is the biggest complaint about Paypal -- their unreserved and blatant bias against sellers.
Hopefully people don't get confused when their BTC gets locked up in Paypal's system and think "BTC is broken and untrustworthy."

It's been in progress since a few months ago. Hopefully exchange rates start to normalize and they stop fluctuating by 40% on a monthly basis due to hoarding.
Frankly a 3% month-over-month change would be ideal for broadening adoption.

Courage? They previously accepted BTC but shunned it when it became politically inconvenient, and now that it's in vogue again they're quite happy to go along.
Don't get confused, there's nothing courageous about it. Their wisdom stops where "the fringe" begins.

Just like any security architecture it depends on your needs. If you have &gt;$100K in BTC then it would stand to reason that you need significantly higher levels of security (eg: split private keys, offline-only wallets).
[This is a nice explanation]( and the service itself is also interesting, however there is always a risk in running third-party software.
For lower levels of need, keeping multiple back-ups is recommended as it's easy to lose track of a thumb drive.

thegenesisblock.com is quickly becoming an excellent source of BTC news.

If there's anything that BTC accomplishes, it makes a lot of people realize how hand-wavy you 'economists' are. There aren't that many professions with such a high ratio of people who stare into an abyss and try to predict the weather based on that.
Recent news in BTC seems to have attracted people who live and breath on spreading FUD and hyping things to new heights (or cavernous depths).

Good luck with that.

There is a website like Wikipedia [but for Bitcoins]( it's is a good place to start.

*I'm not attacking EFF*. If I'm attacking anything then I'm attacking the people who are praising EFF for their decision, which I think is a nonsense response not based on reality.
The EFF's decision to not take BTC donations is rooted in pragmatism, and their decision to again start taking BTC donations is also rooted in pragmatism -- there is nothing inherently courageous or wise about their decisions.

Can you be more specific? It's not "supposed" to be anything, it just is.

Bitcoin is more than a currency, it's also a major, international, and very fast transaction network.

Or you could keep from killing yourself and trade only once a week.
Take it deep breath and count to ten, once every ten minutes.

If you wanna have fun with definitions then we can call it an asset too.
BTC is also a major and reliable international transaction network too.

Been a long time coming, there's been a lot of noise about a price correction. It's right on schedule.
Ignore the latest prices, watch the 200-day moving average.

Most currency exchanges already have hours of operation, specifically 24/5 rather than 6.5/5 (NYSE).

Price manipulation occurs based on volume. A year ago the price would've probably doubled after this one transaction, thankfully we're moving past that nonsense.
