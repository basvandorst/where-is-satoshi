I love how people use that random Japanese dude like its him. Dude came out and said, I’m not him, leave me alone, and authorities still raided his home.

Not Bitcoin, something else. Something that isn’t centralized and dependent upon PoW. That whole system was unfortunately exploited and has turned into something new. Bitcoin can be digital gold, a store of wealth, that it does well.

He’s saying if the one he’s invested in most loses the  place, then there is a more valuable investment that isn’t his. In other words, he’s trying to say he’d be upset if that were to happen because he would have missed the opportunity to win. 
There are way better investments than Bitcoin. Bitcoin is manipulated, slow, more centralized than you think, and not scalable through non secondary layered solutions. Failed experiment, for sure it will be surpassed when mass adoption in this industry takes off.
Thinking otherwise is like thinking Napster would be worth more than Amazon. Bitcoin is old tech, new tech will replace it.

Because you’re all thick headed buffoons. BTC maximalist are amongst the dumbest kind for some reason that ignore all logic/common sense before posting. If this comment offends you, you’re one of them.
BTC is a shit show. It is targeted by Wall St, and is constantly manipulated by dumping to exercise their short contracts. 
All BTC having larger dominance does is leave all of crypto in general in shambles, forever doomed by manipulation. If we leave it to this failed experiment, the whole crypto ecosystem will be doomed. Wall St and large institutions can basically control the entire crypto market just by making BTC their bitch.

Unless you asked him yourself, its impossible to know exactly what he was saying. It did not sound like your interpretation at all. This is a BTC focused Reddit, so I wouldn’t be surprised if these crazy maximalist meant “if something that isn’t BTC beats BTC then everything is doomed”. There was an egotistic element in that statement, another reason why another states “thats an empty statement”

Common, don’t lie to yourself, Bitcoin becomes more centralized by the the day. China owns the hash-rate, and Bitcoin is as good as digital gold. It’s slow, ineffective, expensive and is easily manipulated. 
You’re the same kid who thought Napster would be the first trillion dollar company. You probably bought into pets.com and still hold Exon shares. 
Do I think Bitcoin will flourish in the future or in a bull run? Yes. But based on pure speculation. 
Is it the most centralized coin, no. It has been exploited, and you know it. Satoshi’s vision was taken for granted, and now the PoW system has failed. 
For the entire market to flourish, BTC should not have 57% dominance. The higher the dominance, the faster the bubble will pop.

Can someone explain in more detail with what this means? 
@_date: 2018-08-12 03:37:45
This is not a good thing. Altcoins follow and when the frequently manipulated and moody Bitcoin acts up, the entire market suffers. This is why the crypto industry is currently stuck in the mud. The entire industry is based on some slow, and ineffective coin that people who invested in it, want to get rid of banks, but now await regulation and demand it from a regulatory body.
I thought Bitcoin was created to circumvent the government.

Realistically HODLers are just those who didn’t make money. Unless they were in that position previously, wouldn’t change your lifestyle unless you sold. There are HODlers who haven’t sold since 2012.
The guys who have huge net worths due to BTC are because they held. Most of you’s would have made a quick $10,000 and bought a used car.

The 918 and Carrera GT aren’t main production vehicles. They are limited production for specific Porsche clientele. Whether they’re sold on the secondary market is up to the owners.
I acknowledge the insane engineering that goes into those Hyper cars. And you are right, the GT2 RS is a monstrosity that exceeds a traditional super car due to it being a highly specialized track focused 911. I acknowledge its Nurburgring lap time. Porsche and Lamborghini hold those spots at the top.
To say Lamborghini is trash when in performance it either beats it or is akin, basically is you saying Porsche is trash. The Huracan Performante beat the 918 lap time. I understand the GT2 RS beat the Huracan Peformante, but now its time to test the Aventador SV-J to reclaim that title as  
And then I’m sure Porsche will engineer a new 918 that will take that spot.

Sounds like both of you have never driven/owned a Lamborghini. They’re wonderful cars, and the modern creations are quite comfortable. They’re aesthetics on wheels, part of Italian heritage. They take pride in their master piece. Lamborghini’s are renowned as the words best Supercar, and don’t call Porsche a Supercar. They’re not classified as a Supercar. (I love Porsche’s as well)

You guys don’t understand the mind of this man though. He’s a self made billionaire and more successful than anyone here on this thread for a reason. As head of JP Morgan, they aren’t circumventing endorsing something they consider “threatening”. 
Have any of you guys thought about the fact they may see no use case? That there are other scalable solutions that do what Bitcoin does, but much better? That if it hasn’t been developed, that there will be something to replace it?
My only problem with the Bitcoin maximalist are the fact that they affirm the anarchist mentality of “down with the banks!!” but beg for approval of ETF’s and institutional investors just for the purpose of an appreciated Bitcoin. We know at the end of the day you’re going to convert that BTC back into fiat and bank that cash at the banks you supposedly hate.

All of Reddit bought at $20k and are sad Pandas now. Everyone is doom and gloom, lost faith.
If thats the case pack it in, risk was never an option for you and you invested more than you could afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:01:13
But thats great for those who invested early, majority of people invested probably above $7k which would be the worst investment. A year gone and zero gains if you held. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 19:04:26
I doubt 2014 will happen again, more is being done on the backend for blockchain/crypto as it becomes more legitimized. Investors in 2014 stood alone, digital assets even at that time was like a novelty. 
Those “weirdos” who bought and held BTC even back in 2014 have been rewarded heavily.

Seems likes everyone is okay with $2000-$3500 BTC. I wouldn’t care if the market wasn’t tied to BTC, but it is, and unless you’re $0 invested, we do not want a $2000 BTC, because at a certain point everyone has a breaking point and the market would crumble at those levels.
Whales and long term holders would lose faith and dump, then you’d have your $0.10 BTC. 
Then you guys would be happy?

 No Aventador cost $900k, and second, thats a Hurácan not an Aventador in the picture display.

Manipulation takes TA and says “fuck you!”. I know HODL was a bad strategy in 2018 but when crypto reaches adoption, and really takes off, those who got in early will benefit.
The guys who made $100M+ weren’t the dudes investing in 2017 I can tell you that. They were in through the shitty 2014 and prior. 
Anyone who thinks crypto is dead or won’t exceed $1-10T in total value is brain dead and has zero understanding of Aggregate Global Economics and how much “money” circulates.

Yes but there is OTC trading going on affecting the markers with shorting. The markets are intentionally suppressed/manipulated to satisfy the futures contract. CME/CBOE are getting scammed. They need to investigate that kind of stuff in order for this market to flourish.

Bitmain could make it extremely stressful to use if they wanted to. Its flawed. It is becoming more centralized by the day.
