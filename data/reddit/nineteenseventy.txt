If trezor gets mainstream, you can bet your bitcoins there will be an automated virus that can beat Trezors pin scheme. It's like the worms these days that parse your system for Game cd keys as well as Excel files named "Password". 
I would have to research some more about Trezor to make a better judgement.

No he's correct, because with mining your essentially trading some fiat to make the bitcoin, and at the current difficulty it isn't worth it, as you can buy the same amount for much cheaper.
I mistook his comment to say he's not mining because the Bitcoin price is too low, when in fact it's because the network hashing difficulty is too high coupled with whatever electric prices that you have.

or leave the last 2 words in your will, and give the family the 10 words. 
I think the will should have 6 words and the family gets 6 as 2 words can be guessed by bruteforcing the dictionary.

I believe more money and assets have been stolen than either paper or technological failures combined. I'm more worried about having my coins stolen than lost due to techology/paper failures.


Who's to say BIP38 will be used 10 years later? All technology changes even paid software by professionals.
I see BIP38 as inferior to Electrums 12 words because:
* I can write down my 12 words on paper in plaintext and retrieve these 12 words anytime later so long as I have that paper. The same can be done with BIP38 in plaintext. I'm assuming BIP38 allows for no encryption
* I can write down my 12 words in paper in an encrypted form and remember a password and so long as I have the paper and so long as I remember my password I can retrive my coins. This concept is actually BIP38, as you have a paper wallet + password. So far both are equivalent.
* I can write down my 12 words in paper in an encrypted form and remember a password. If I lose that paper, I can try to write down 12 words from memory without that paper. This is were BIP38 breaks down. You aren't going to remember that data stored in BIP38 format in human memory.
I think you're trying to argue that I should write down my seed in encrypted form instead of just keeping it in my head. Is that what you're pushing? It's actually what I do, but with the 12 words and not with BIP38. I have 3 written copies in encrypted form, as well as a usb drive with the 12 words encrypted. I've scattered these 3 in different locations. However I treat these as backups to the human memory version of remembering.
If worst case scenario happened and I went to jail for 20 and lost all my assets/properties I can still rely my memory to retrieve my coins. With BIP38 I would be out of luck and out of bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:25:11
It's also what I have done but encrypted with a password I've used most my life, since that'll stick most. The point is I can lose all these pieces of paper and if I can recite 12 words I'll have my bitcoins. If I lose all my BIP38 paper wallets, there is no plan B.

haha yeah best leave those countertops unnicked. Cool I didn't know about the punch set. Fyi check your 12 words once every 1-2 years as the software algorithm might change over time since it's free software. I just don't recommend sitting on these dog tags for 20 years and then realizing they're no good with the new versions of electrum. You might have to move your coins and hammer out a new dog tag set after a big revision of the software, which may or may not change it's seed algorithm.

See my other comment: 
Basically either with BIP38 or Electrum you have to memorize something. With BIP38 you also need a printout or picture of the code to complete it. Your password is useless in BIP38 if you don't have the paper wallet printout. Depending on something physical leaves you open to having that item stolen. You can't have 12 memorized words stolen.
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:39:29
You're on the right track and there are hundreds of ways to bring up your 12 words. Just make sure you remember you're formula.
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:41:36
That's a whole other question of trust. Both the 12 words method and the BIP38 method can be shared with family. Both are equivalent here.

So basically the hashing difficulty + electric costs aren't worth it, NOT the price of bitcoins. I hope I am understanding it correctly. So basically you've turned your equipment off for good, until either the difficulty decreases, which is possible or your local electric price drops a good amount, which most likely will not happen.
I too turned off my bitcoin asic miner + GPU for altcoin mining about last week, when I was getting cents on the dollar. And as a reference my electricty costs are around $0.13 per kw

Yeah I'm a software dev, I'm aware;) However what scared me is that this week 1 or 2 people posted about loosing Bitcoins during a transfer to some unknown change address which was unaccessible to him, and then a report about multibit failing to transfer any amount over 1k.
That's too many red flags for one piece of software, and while someone of these posts may have resulted from human error, or stupidity, or possibly malware, all signs point to the Multibit software as unmatured.

I don't get it. I thought you were a long term bull, so it doesn't matter what the price of bitcoins is now, because you'll be selling bitcoin a year or more down the road. 
If anything you should keep mining until the difficulty is much too high to turn any profit.
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:38:27


Yes that is true to a big degree, but there are tricks to help you out. 
You can always sacrifice a bit of randomness and use 12 words from a quote/song/speech/book. Just make sure you pick something obscure or throw in a "test" word as the 1st or 12th word that isn't in that song lyric or speech that completes your 12 words. Something unrelated but something you will remember.


Correct, it uses a wordlist I believe from the python library as it's source. Lets assume you just got out of a 20 year prison sentence and still remember your 12 words. I mean you've only had 20 years to recite them over and over and over again out of boredom and these 12 words are all you have left in the world as the FBI sold all your assets. Lets also assume Electrum updated it's python word list and it no longer works with your words, as the enumeration changed. Since we have the internet we can search for a really old version of electrum that will work or keep going backwards with Electrum versions until it works. If computers OS's also have changed, you can always run a virtual machine to run the 20 year old Electrum version. So you always have a way.
Electrum is a good deterministic solution to storing your bitcoin private keys, but as pointed out Electrum or more importantly it's word list can change. I believe in the future another program will replace Electrum with a standardized word list taken from some non changing source. For example it might use Shakespeare's books as the word list, as Shakespeare probably won't be updating those books anytime soon or a some standardized bible.
Obviously if a replacement to Electrum comes out and it has a word list that will never change then its a good idea to transfer your coins to a wallet generated address of this new tool. If only to save you the headache I described above.
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:24:33
Again that's still leaving your key to a 3rd party. A web crawler needs to hosted somewhere on someones server and who's to prevent your key from being stolen off the server like in the early days of bitcoin startups?
12 words, memorize them and you're done. I bet you still know nursery rhymes to this day and they are more than 12 words.
**edit:** I never said to use a nursery rhyme as the 12 words. I just used it to show how easy it is to remember something when repeated for a while.
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:22:15
That's the problem even if you have the BIP38 encrypted and the password memorized, you can still lose your coins in the sense of not having a copy of the BIP38 encrypted wallet. You can go to jail today and lose your assets/property/safety deposit box at a bank if you're assets get sold to cover debt or fines.
With Electrum's 12 words, you just need to know 12 words. Those can never be siezed.
@_date: 2014-08-27 13:37:02
Everyone is saying BIP38, but that still means your placing trust and 100BTC into a sheet of paper. Paper is not a good store of anything. It degrades overtime in quality and paper can still be lost, burned, wet/smudged, forgotten, stolen, copied and eaten by pests. Shit moths can take out your 100BTC. Bitcoin right now is worth ~$500, but in the future could be double or 10x more easily. Would you trust a 5x5" sheet of paper with 1/2 a million dollars? I wouldn't.
The best way is via Electrum's 12 words. If you can remember the names of the 12 months, which are proper nouns, then you can remember 12 words.
Create a deterministic wallet in Electrum and remember 12 random words and you'll always have access to your BTC no matter if the Swat team raided your house/assets, or you found yourself halfway around your word or you spent 20 years in jail and all your assets and properties have long been sold/auctioned. So long as you can recite your 12 words and type them into Electrum you will always have access to your wallet. Oh and change address are auto handled by Electrum and retain in this same wallet. So 12 words gives you several addresses but can always be reproduced.
You can always get separated from your BIP38 paper, but you can't get separated from your brain. Well you can get separated from your brain, but then Bitcoin won't be your first issue.
**edit:** It seems people have gotten confused. You should always have physical backups of your keys whether its 12 words in Electrum or BIP38. However realize that if you lose all copies of your key, with Electrums 12 word scheme, if you still remember the 12 words you can get your Bitcoins back regardless if you lost all physical copies. With BIP38 you need at least one copy otherwise you'll lose all your coins. Memorizing a BIP38 seed is near impossible for the average person, nor is it recommended.

Yup, and sometimes it says Disconnected in red at the bototm left other times you have no idea until you're wondering why your bitcoin/altcoin miners haven't brought in any revenue, only to restart Multibit and have it load the new transactions..

@_date: 2014-04-09 13:06:29
Can you explain how a non-deterministic wallet would help here? AFAIK a deterministic wallet uses a seed for your wallet so, so long as you have that seed, and private keys generated by that wallet can be retrived if lost so long as you have the seed.
No idea how a deterministic wallet would solve OP's problem here. Just sounds like the Multibit client is more of a hack than it appears. As another user pointed out, it was never tested on testnet for such values bigger than 1k, and this week people reported losing money during transfers to some "change address" which cannot be accessed or recovered.
I myself have been using Multibit since day one, and I'll probably be switching to Electrum or Armory. Does anyone have any comments on either, good or bad?

Ok so you've gained security in never loosing the key as you have it in 3 locations, but you've just introduced 3 new risk sources. If any of those 3 sources decides to steal your keys you wouldn't be able to do anything about it.
You mentioned you keep one copy at your sister's house. Do you trust your sister? How about in 10 years after you've had a big fight on Thanksgiving? Or how about her new husband? Or her kids that will probably go through her stuff at home? Or her maid she just hired to clean her house? Do you see where I am going with this?
@_date: 2014-08-27 14:30:47


Ok so you've decreased the risks of water/fire/pest, but you can still have your BIP38 keys copied and stolen. And if your idea of security is storing your metal BIP38 key in a Bank, then you're missing the point of Bitcoin and having control over your money. If the government gets a warrant they can have access to your Bank + locker. In a warrant can grant them access to all your properties and assets. You're other choice is to go Breaking Bad and go bury the key in a random location.


The same thing that happens to your cold storage coins stored on a metal BIP38 card. It gets lost. I'm pretty sure with a BIP38 metal wallet you'd have to hide it somewhere not easily accessible or obvious. 
To pass on your coins to someone else after death you'd have had to share your key + location of where you hid/stored your key with someone before hand. Same goes for Electrum's 12 words. You'd have to share it with someone before you depart.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:08:01
I agree that at some point Electrum will not work with my 12 words, however that timeframe is measure in years not months or weeks. I'm not planning on keeping these words to the grave or 20 years later, but instead keeping track of Electrum or another deterministic wallet that when finalized will not change its enumeration of words or it's algorithm. I currently have ~41BTC which I mined/traded/bought and you bet I'm going to make sure I can always access my coins at any given time. I believe the risk of me not being able to access my coins due to new versions of Electrum is low. You can always dig up an old copy of it, as the internet has a way or archiving information. Of course that doesn't mean I'm going to leave 5 years of a gap between the last time I check that my 12 words still function. That's just negligence.
Every 2 years or so I'm gonna check up on my words and see if they work with every version or eventually migrate to a stable non changing method.
The point is I can store my seed in memory or paper wallets. I do both. I agree a physical copy is needed and recommended but it's nice to know you can also produce your private keys from memory via these 12 words, whether you're at home or on the beach in Thailand. That adds mobility to your Bitcoins in addition to security.
While my wealth is my individual concern at this time, in the future I plan to share my seed so that after my passing away the coins can be used by whomever I gave them to. However it doesn't matter what storage method you use so long as you give the person the seed + password if there is one. Your last point is simply a matter of trust.
@_date: 2014-08-27 15:00:30
Ok that's cool and all, but whether with BIP38 or Electrum you have to memorize something and keep it safe in your head. 
With BIP38 you have to keep that password memorized AND have access to at least one copy of this paper printout. What happens if the FBI or government legally or not takes all copies of this paper wallet? Then your password is worthless. You're putting trust into a 2nd hand party to keep your wallet safe. That's introducing a second risk for no reason.
Why not just memorize 12 words and be done with it. These 12 words can never be seized by any agency or person unless you let them by telling them the 12 words.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:17:57
No one said you can't encrypt your 12 words and write them down. The difference is that with Electrums 12 words and BIP38, you can memorize Electrums seed and with BIP38 you cannot as it's too much data.
So Electrum gives me more freedom and mobility and acts as a second way to retrieve your coins even if you don't have a paper wallet.

It's funny how you're voted down, but you're right. Early adopters were the ones buying in when BTC was ~$20. Anyone who bought in after the $1200 price bubble, was late to the game. Now that bitcoin is down to $250, many more people bought in for a few coins. The only people that are going to get rich by sitting on bitcoin are the people with 10k+ coins.
