No stripe holds stellar. So they are pumping that. And you really don’t need stripe to use btc. See the irony of having peer to peer but using a trusted third party. Stop idolizing the third parties. Bitcoin doesn’t need them. 
Just like Open Bazaar, Stripe gets .0001% if it’s revenue from btc. That’s nothing. For them it was just marketing. Not a big factor in bitcoin at all.

Actually it is. If you think utility or being able to make payments is the only quality then you are a fool. Why is trillions upon trillions of fiat sitting in offshore accounts doing nothing? Why is gold worth trillions but no one accepts it? I can’t even buy a burger with diamonds. So you either hoard it or spend it and let businesses hoard it. They ain’t going to pay employees with it yet. It’s still early and if SOV gets us closer to MOE then I’m fine. No matter what and this applies to all these coins. Till businesses pay employees in one it’s just hoard till one does. GMO is putting it’s mouth where it’s pocketbook is and paying employees part of their wages in btc. That’s a start

Those tokens are just a fancy kick starter. Get real dude. ETH wants to be everything and anything. It’s just a load of crap. It’s all marketing and no tech. They rushed it to market because of rich statefulness. How many ppl have to lose funds before they wake up. And that pre mine still lingers. So what’s this got to do with bitcoin. It has everything to do with it. Because even Nick calls ETH a rek. I’d like to be supportive of ETH but my morals of soundness and values lie with btc. Maybe you should look into what RSK can do. Maybe their approach is what the market needs.

It’s great because it is the true innovation. It’s censorship resistant. This means no one can stop you from sending or receiving any amount of bitcoin. It’s decentralized. This means it has no center. It has no one to control it. It’s open source. This means you can view the code. You can create new code to add to it. But remember no one has to run your code. It’s permissionless. You don’t need authority to use. You can mine for it too. It’s borderless. No one country has rights to change it by creating a law. No CEO can make changes that users don’t want. It’s sort of private. When you use it the coins don’t have your name or ID attached to it. It’s value is derived by its users not by a state authority. It has a fixed supply. This means no one can make more and cause you to lose value. There are forks but they don’t count. Each one is separate. 
Most people have no clue how the banking systems work and play out. So most people have no clue why bitcoin benefits them. Most people are falling prey to coins and tokens from a marketing standpoint. Bitcoin has no marketing and it’s better that way. It sells itself vs some celebrity trying to.

If I’m hearing this correctly I’m getting confused. The LN network will be or drive down cost to practically 0. The network participants will allow this.

The protocol implementation is good. I’ll address what you listed. 
Lost coins are not lost. They still reside on the Blockchain. But no one has the private keys. How much gold is lost. How much fiat has been lost. They even burn it so that doesn’t matter. 
Stolen coins. People steal what they desire. That in itself means btc has value. 
Bitcoin whales are no richer than say Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos. As a matter of fact the top 0.01% own more than 50% of global wealth. They control the distribution of wealth whether you know it or not. Atleast with Bitcoin you can buy a few miners and participate creating new bitcoins. 
As for stability bitcoin is a global currency being distributed and priced by markets not government decree. It will be volatile till it’s value reflects the economies it circulates in. We are at the foundation of the distribution process. New systems are being created to allow for circulation too. But we are just not there yet. You have a chance at this moment to secure generational wealth. Take it while it last. Those closer to 2009 took a lot of risk and got lucky. I myself am included. Be most of us are not trying to be the new elite. We want it to be inclusive and opt in. It has incentives based on you and your abilities. Having some today will be your savings or change the lifestyle you live in the future. But bootstrapping a fair and equitable one is just dreaming.

No they actually take bitcoin. But they are not trying to get it to sell for fiat. They are just trying to get it. So it’s no push for them. I think most did .01 btc last month. It’s not a revenue source for them to live off of. But they can save. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:35:17
The idea behind bitcoin at the moment is for saving. And bundling transactions together makes good use of block space. But on the LN there is no blocks. So there is no need to bundle. I don’t see or have never thought of a credit system with bitcoin.

The government has no need to create a new bitcoin served by them. They have fiat legal tender. Bitcoin is attractive because it has no central authority. It has no nation state to dictate how it’s controlled either. And that’s the point. That’s what decentralization does for you. It gives you control vs being given permission.

The good thing about bitcoin is after the fallout is over you can take a computer and start mining again from where the chain stopped. As long as there are a few coins left and a programmer then your good. Just add more 00’s after the decimal to meet the demands for a medium of exchange. Gold maybe radioactive or non accessible. But people will always have a need to exchange things of value.

They don’t need to issue Tether. They don’t issue BTC either. The Chinese can’t trade crypto with RMB. So they use USDT. When Binance has issued all its USDT they buy it from Bitfinex. Once they buy it Bitfinex creates more. Basically USDT is a proxy for Chinese demand to buy crypto. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:48:40
Do you know what a warrant canary is. What it is used for. The CFTC or really the US government does not care about Tethers. They could easily just issue a cease and desist. Or they could just shut them down. They want names bro. 
Also the higher demand means users are buying more. The more they buy the more they print or create. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 05:29:11
Seriously I get tired of this backing non sense. USD is created out of thin air. Deal with it. When you borrow money a bank creates USD and you get the debt obligation to pay that back. But where did the USD come from. Thin air. So how are you going to back USDT with something USD that is created out of thin air. Wake up this is crypto. Most of us are into money for real. 
As for the CME. Even the gold bugs hate futures because that’s what prices gold. There is 12x more ounces of gold sold through futures than what exist. So yes futures is a scam to. They don’t have to take physical because it’s cash settled. Sure it’s a contract between a buyer and a seller. But what does the buyer use. Cash. What are they buying nothing because there is no delivery of physical. So what does the seller sell. Nothing because they don’t have to deliver anything. All this nonsense about futures is a scam too. But because it trades at some cough cough reputable exchange makes it real.

Nope don’t think so. I remember many were pissed at the HKA. What gives the devs and the miners the say. Bitcointalk was blasting both groups. And we had chances to raise the blocksize. Classic, XT, BU just didn’t appeal to anyone. 
Most aged nodes are not in it for the money. They get none. It’s all ideals. And when we updated to Segwit and miners failed to lock it in made it worse. We even went to the point of rejecting blocks. UASF worked once before and it worked again. Remember all the buzz about Blockchain. That’s the nodes. We ensure and validate the rules are followed. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:31:14
Why are you so fixated on governments. They didn’t create the rules. We are. And on the taxation part it’s kind of tough for them. I can buy at an exchange at $15k. Transfer out at $14.5k for a loss. But still have possession of my bitcoin. And once it is in my wallet it is up to me whether I pay a tax on it. Taxes are voluntary. Now if they want all wallets to be registered then that’s pretty tough too. A wallet can be paper. What you fail to understand is people are regaining their sovereign rights. Money is free speech and is protected by our constitution. Sorry I do not exist for the government. Government exist for me. And many others. Things will just have to change. No longer is money going to be used as a system of control for governments benefit. They work for us and don’t forget that.

When you load your LN wallet that’s pretty much it. One on chain transfer to off chain. Then you can spend on LN. My last transaction was 1 Satoshi. And the rest stays in my wallet till I want to spend again. I’m not even using a heavily funded hub either. But yes it will cost me $3 to put $1000 off chain. As for the exchange fee. Everybody pays those. It’s not unique to just btc. But as I’ve said you can test it on test net. HTLC.me. Many ppl who have no clue are using LN on test net. This is what the network look ma like too.

More segwit transactions are being used and batching transactions too. This is how you lower fees. Use blockspace wiser. When LN grows more transactions will happen off chain so the mempool won’t be filled up. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:00:47
Actually it’s not a small group of people deciding this. You have to get the node operators to run that code. As nodes age into the network they become more resistant to change. That’s how we keep consensus. If a large set of new nodes want a blocksize increase then they are free to follow that rule set. But the aged nodes won’t change. And seeing these aged nodes not changing means the new rule set with the new code won’t be followed. 
This is what makes it appear that Core makes the rules. But really you have these nodes out there that really are not likely to update the code for some reason. Even most of the Core devs know this. When they write code they hope we will run it. They gave the miners a choice to lock in Segwit. Miners took it as a vote and used it for leverage. Those aged nodes did not blink. New nodes are encouraged to join consensus not create a new one. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:13:29
This is good talk. To add it’s best to understand what you are buying. Just do like many do. Buy what you can afford to lose. At the moment fees are higher so if you are purchasing less than $100 at a time you need to set a limit on how much you will need to transfer to your own wallet. I’d say $500 is worth it to transfer out. 
Hodl. We are not all traders. And branching out is not the best thing to do. Learn before you risk. I understand the temptations to make more but more often than not you will lose. The less btc the market has the better. Stay safe and remember it’s not about how much you can make. It’s about how much you don’t want to lose. Class of 2012.

I believe the correct terminology is digital asset. Tangible or not digital assets have value. Think of video games. They are digital assets. Or a writer putting a book in digital form. Is it less valuable than putting the words in a paper book. 
The ones creeping for tangibility are either confused or just plain outright misleading. This world is digital. Bitcoin has solved the double spend. Imagine an original music works. You can practically give it a hash to state rightfully ownership without needing physical media. Then have child hashes for distribution and copyright. 
Forget not that the future is not created by its elders but by its youth. But you have a strong presence of boomers who wish not and care not to allow the youth to prevail.

Just keep repeating what everyone else says. Here’s the reality. Bitcoin is going off chain. Once this gets established in order for other coins to compete they will have to follow. If they don’t they get crushed. You must not be paying attention. As a matter of fact fees have become cheaper. Why did they get so high. Because bitcoin was being attacked. Now the attack is over. The attackers spent millions to change the narrative. They did that to influence you. 
Bitcoin is allowing all users to participate in testing LN. HTLC.me. What other project does that. None. 
Bitcoin is peer to peer. If you want the luxury of having a trusted third party then use Visa. Stripe knows exactly why they are leaving. Because none of their customers were using it. That’s a fact. But they come out and blame fees. The attackers won. They beat Stripe not Bitcoin. The best way to win the game is to beat your competitors. That’s why we will always have Coinbase and Bitpay. Stripe just can’t compete with them. They don’t have enough scale in Bitcoin. They won’t have any scale with the shitcoins either.

Here is a thought. You have almost 1 btc. Make that a goal to reach. At these lower prices you can easily achieve that. Only 21 million ppl in the world can ever have 1 btc. Join that club. Then consider that to be the amount you are willing to lose and go back to saving in fiat. Watching the daily price causes you to have impulses. 
For the last 6 years I have been putting in what I can afford to lose. Little by little over the course of years it has worked out. The reasoning is if you get enough ppl to think the same way it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Let traders be traders. Those who buy over time what they are willing to lose will overcome traders. We are the demand. When a whale of Wahl Street steps in to drop the price you will have millions of us buying what we can afford to lose. You may buy tops. You may buy bottoms. But in the end you will have btc and traders won’t. It’s that easy.

It’s fairly easy to spam a broadcast network which bitcoin is. As for a unicast network spam attacks come in the form of a hub with many channels.

Channels don’t have dedicated routes either so any spam attack can be routed around.

I guess you don’t see what is happening. When I sell Btc, LTC,ETH or any crypto for tether they have to have a certain amount to keep the price of tether $1. I’m not trying to go from tether to USD. If that was the case I’d just sell for USD. As the market cap of all crypto grows so does the demand for tether. They are not creating it out of thin air. It’s backed by the crypto that people use to buy it. It also has a base amount of USD but that only covers to cash out to USD. But we aren’t doing that because USD is slow and comes with risk to hold it. So a derivative is used. It’s not different than cash settled futures. You don’t have to own btc to trade it. So they can create as many btc contracts as possible without ever having a private key. What’s the difference? Do the burden of proof is on the CME to prove that each contract is backed by btc. 
Stop making this a big deal when it’s not. Or complain about the futures contracts as aggressively as you do about tether.

Actually if Core does code a blocksize increase most nodes won’t run that code. That’s what most don’t understand. What is our incentive?  Atleast with LN we can monetize our bandwidth. We won’t make a profit but it’s better than unlimited cost. Also, after years of being told that nodes don’t matter doesn’t help either. But whether you know this or not Segwit does increase the capacity in MB. And that was the tradeoff. Miners just didn’t want to take the discount.

FOSS has existed for decades. This is how it is. When code gets merged it’s not because a few ppl say so. It takes many. Then you run into the nodes. They don’t have to run the code. They can run something else. We don’t have auto update like ETH.

That’s how all rating agencies work. An investor pays for it on their behalf. That’s how they pump. The rest of the world does not care what some American thinks is a good bet. They are now doing the exact opposite. I’ve learned my lesson fro the past. Rating agencies are one of the biggest scams in the financial world. All of them. 
What matters most to a bitcoiner. And this should be for everyone else. Security, decentralization, immutability, censorship resistance, sanction proof, and privacy. Don’t let some business type tell you anything they think crypto should be. 
We have been saying this for years. But the US financial world still wants to call the shots. Who cares about them. Who cares about their markets. If they want to accept bitcoin then they will play by our rules not the ones they make it better for them. You see what CNBC did. This rating agency will do the same.

You are not convincing anyone. BCash is centralized. At this point you must admit it. Which you don’t care about anyway. It doesn’t matter if you have 3000 nodes controlled by one entity. And 1000 nodes controlled by another. What is the point. Just run 2 nodes. Trying to make your chain look decentralized when it’s not is just part of the deception. 
No one here cares that much about BCash. But we use it as an example of bad engineering practices. Where as bitcoin is to stand the test of time. There is no need to be running badass nodes right now. 100 years from now you might need a badass nodes because the storage requirements. But that just means it’s working. Your time horizon doesn’t permit you to think past a few years. I’m thinking of a few decades at a time when it comes to nodes.

It would be good for the Chinese also. The statist and those types actually hinder mankind with games like currency valuation. Human are productive as proof of work too. The amount of energy needed to produce a certain good is the same no matter what region you live in. Bitcoin levels the playing field in the arms of productivity not capital. It enables capital to be free from currency controls. Regions have to compete on being efficient at scale not just being a cheap representation of a currency. Increasing the standards of living for all mankind is what this world needs to grow. Not some corporatist wet dream of chasing around the world for cheap labor or machine labor.

The other coins maybe cheaper. But there is a reason they are cheaper. They are not Bitcoin. Do you go out and buy yellow painted metal because it’s cheaper than gold. No, you buy a few grams of it. Not a whole ounce or even a bar. You buy grams. Bitcoin is no different.

Nation state currencies don’t collapse. But they do stop being used as an international settlement currency. As for why Bitcoin has value or maintain its value. It is censorship  resistant. This means no government can come in and stop a payment due to political beliefs. It is anti fragile. This means no government or group can just change the code. It is permission less. It is decentralized. This keeps it from being shut down. Also it does not require a third party to use. 
Why hodling is important? Because it is a better store of value. At the moment demand for block space outstrips the supply. We could increase the block space but then centralizing effects takes place. This means you lose more of the qualities I’ve stated for a transactional convenience. Block chains don’t scale well. Even in 2010 Hal Finney stated we needed a light client. And Satoshi is quoted saying coffee purchases don’t belong on a blockchain. This is appeal to authority but it’s true. 
Hodling reduces the supply that can be traded. We still live in a fiat world. Miners and merchants are seen as a supply to the markets. So if you reduce the supply with the constant demand fiat prices fall against btc. This means the price of btc is going up in fiat terms.

We will see. If it is anything like when 401K’s were introduced in the 90’s then the ride is really going to be amazing. To note Fidelity is being quiet about what they are doing. Bitcoin will enter a new phase. 
As for institutional investors, they are not afraid of bitcoin. But the companies like Coinbase just don’t have the reputation credibility they want. And the hope is Bakkt and Fidelity can provide that. After that an ETF can and will come out. Many of them will come out. But the SEC wants an exchange that will act in the true spirit of what they wish to safeguard. Investors. 
The point you and many don’t ever mention. Who are these institutional investors. And what do they do. An institutional investor is not a family office. Nor is it a VC or Hedgefund. Institutional investors are the top of the food chain. They hold and administer funds and assets for pensions and retirement accounts. They are the ones how have $89T to invest on the behalf of teachers, police officers, and working Americans. 
Why do they need custody? They need custody because it’s not their money. They need safeguards to keep internal theft at bay. Don’t believe those who say not your keys not your coin when it comes to something like this. You need it to be highly regulated and lots of oversight. And the crypto industry is just not up for the par with them.

I beg to differ on some points. First, third parties won’t control most of the coins for ppl. 17 million coins have already been mined. And 85% of those are not in the hands on trusted third parties. So with 4 million left about half of those will be with trusted third parties. And if you can’t control your own keys as a retail or noob then something is really wrong with you. Most solution we have today are for you. 
Next, the fears of an ETF and Wahl Street are getting out of hand. An ETF opens up a different class of investors. It will create demand for new money because the funds will first have to buy bitcoin. Also, Bakkt will act as a vehicle to allow pension funds and 401K providers the ability to own bitcoin. And i will tell you. You need a custody provider when you are dealing with other ppls money. And as with any new asset they will be conservative and make as much as they can unlevered. And the returns will be more than average by a long shot for the next few decades. Yes I said decades. 
Last once the US financial system gets involved the rest of the world ex China and Russia will fall in line. Or they will just be left out. They all need the confidence the the US to proceed. That is global order for the foreseeable future. China had a chance to take the lead. And like the communist have been for decades they have closed themselves out. But in the future they will join and that’s when it gets serious. All that hashing going on and 0 bitcoin will come from China miners.

Yes and visa has one major advantage that btc does not have. They are the scaling solution for nation state fiat. And with the service they provide they get a cut of every sale. 
Bitcoin can do everything visa can do and then some. Yet we are not there yet because we need systems designed built and deployed to facilitate millions of transactions a day. We are not there yet. 
One thing all of you must remember Visa itself had to compete with hundreds of competitors in the last 4 decades to get where it is today. And out of those years we wound up with basically 3-4 major payment providers. So please don’t think crypto will be any different. In the long run don’t be surprised if crypto is only 3-4 coins. We already know it’s going to be bitcoin so the safe bet is to own some. And for those of you who think there is going be your favorite coin. Most likely it won’t be that one.

So it’s easier for them to just top off their channel and spend.

You speak with certainty. Sorry it doesn’t work that way. Keeping the price below breakeven does not effect all miners. Those who are higher cost will come off line. And guess what happens next. The difficulty will change. It will go down. Making it easier for every other miner. That’s how bitcoin works. 
As for the paper contracts this ain’t gold. Bankers can do that to gold because they own most of it. It’s stuffed away in storage. And guess what solution they have for bitcoin. A custody solution. But they have very little takers. I know a few millionaires and they don’t want to store coins with them. So price will resolve once the rest of you decide to just buy bitcoin every pay day.

In many countries the creation of money is created by creating debt. The US is a debt based system. If no one borrows then the system stagnates because no debt is created and no new money is created. The old saying is you are worth what you owe.

Not what you are saying at all. Conbase pegged BTC and BCH. That’s a sign of stress. Why are they trying to help BCH. So it’s easier to take down BTC just to find when Coinbase will stop defending BCH price. The other exchanges could stop helping Coinbase but then Coinbase may become insolvent which may make matters worse. No one wanted BCH and now a few players are dictating it’s the solution. 
Who loses in this? Coinbase and miners. Users are just along for the ride. But the market wants answers to why a new coin gets this kind of support. What makes it so special. This ain’t about Bitcoin. It’s about a stupid clone. Never peg.

In the US online retail only makes up 10% of retail sales. So yes you need brick and mortar to be involved in mass adoption. You need more than just a wallet for them to accept bitcoin. You need physical payment devices for all businesses to be just like if they are paying cash or using visa. What we need is for entrepreneurs to deploy systems that will fill this need. But there you run into an issue. Merchants don’t want to add a system if they don’t see customers wanting to use that system. Customers won’t demand using btc for payment when you get far more benefit by hodling and getting 300% in gains. So we are in a period where either users have to spend so it creates demand for merchants. Or the exchanges have to bid up the price to create the reward for users to spend. Basically at what price is it worth for you to spend. 
With what I said it sounds reasonable for me to say with 21 million coins to only exist it’s not worth it to me to use btc to buy toothpaste. I’d like to be able to buy a nice house and car with 1 btc and still have satoshi’s left over. Which may not happen for a few years more. My price is $195k per coin before I will ever decide to spend. 
What we have is the ecosystem is flooded with options. Everyone wants to be part of the new early investor vs buying and bidding up btc. But the objective in my opinion is to get those in the 21 club to start spending and that will mean btc will have to be atleast 20X of what it is today.

Ok so let’s say you sell your tokens at a discount to someone else. Then they have tokens left over and they sell those at a discount. This continues till those tokens are basically free. Next Biergarten tokens actually provide you with something vs some crypto token. Trading or speculating is not the main purpose nor does that make your token any better. Until your token can be traded for something real like a car or beer then it’s just a vapor coin with a meme.

My view on taxes especially for US users is simple. History. Before the Fed Americans didn’t pay taxes to a central authority. Why were taxes done after the Fed formation. Because it created friction and prevented hoarding. The government would collect the tax from the rich and redistribute it for services. But somewhere down the line the rich felt it as robbery or theft. Do you lower taxes to let them keep more. Then when there is not enough money to provide services the government borrows money for that. After a long enough period of this cycle what you have is what we have today. A government heavily in debt. And the rich with all the money. They are hoarding.

Bitcoin consensus is built upon full nodes. We call them users. But to the extent the true measure is on economic nodes. They accept payments from wallets. The devs will come up with a BIP and an activation method. If the full nodes overwhelmingly accept the BIP is a good sign. Then it is left up to the activation method. We used miners signaling for activation but they took it as they were voting on the change. It was not that. All we wanted was for them to signal they were ready. This continued till nodes got fed up with the politics and took another route. It’s called User activated soft fork aka UASF. What that entailed was miners who do not signal for the change on this block will get there blocks rejected. When a miners block gets rejected they don’t get paid. And miners work for the network not control it. 
How this works is when a miner finds a block. They have to wait for 100 blocks to get paid. In between those 100 blocks the miners block gets rejected then they lose the block reward. So this restrains miners from immediately being able to spend once the reward is found. UASF used this built in mechanism to counter the malicious miners. 
What this also does is allow users who are not part of the economic nodes to safeguard their money from miners and businesses. That’s why we say users have more weight in consensus changes. 
If you only own btc in a wallet and you want a particular change to apply to you. You really have no control over what the wallet does. Just like only a few wallets have Segwit. In that case you can move your coins to a wallet with your choice. Which many Bitcoiners did with segwit. Even when it was only a few wallets. 
I hope this has answered your question.

In a developed world bitcoin serves a great purpose. And it is no different than Venezuela. Inflation protection. It doesn’t have to be hyperinflation. Point in general. The medium household income has increased 2% since 2000. Yet inflation since then till now amounts to 40%. The mask of it all comes from hours earned. People have to work longer hours. 
Secondly, saving not spending actually increases investments. You don’t need to finance current needs with future earnings. That’s called debt. Even with low interest rates is not a reason to take on debt. Lower interest rates creates higher prices. And if anyone looked at what we call inflation it’s true economic term is devaluation or debasement of the currency. This is all in the name of hoarding. But we have more billionaires than ever before. A billionaires is an example of what inflation was trying to prevent. So Bitcoin no matter where you live promotes saving.

Look as much as many would and do not like this. There is nothing to stop it from happening. The concerns are the risk will lie with the exchange and not all hodlers. Also it is for the other exchanges and traders to ensure if fractional reserves is being made to price the other exchange always at a discount. And that discount should reflect the sum of the fractions should equal 1 btc. Basically if Bakkt is using 2x in fractions the other exchanges should price btc 2X of Bakkt prices. By doing that it removes the incentive of practicing fractional reserve banking. The reason FRB was detrimental in the past is because fiat was pegged to gold by the governments. So banks were not as transparent with how many claims they were making. And the governments maintenance what the price should be. Bitcoin has none of that. 
@_date: 2018-09-23 19:49:36
Bitcoin doesn’t need regulations. The exchanges and participants that use bitcoin needs regulations. Know the difference. Bakkt is not Bitcoin. Coinbase is not Bitcoin. And they as centralized entities are susceptible to regulations.

When you purchase in an in app item Apple gets a portion of the sale. It makes no sense for Apple to receive a NFT which has no liquidity or market to tender to USD. This is where tokenizers will find that their game will get no traction on a smartphone platform. Because the token is not being bought thru Apple. Nor is there a revenue sharing agreement with Apple. 
But by no way is Apple being difficult. It’s their ecosystem and they would be caught in the middle and held liable if fraud or theft happens.

This has nothing to do with the US gov. The US has privately funded retirement accounts. And the accounts are not run by bankers. You are just spewing your ideology over something you have no clue about. We do have Social Security which is the world’s biggest Ponzi scheme run by the government. But the private sector retirement vehicles provide great benefits. Especially if the funds are matched by the employers. And no the Fed can’t bail them out. And if your 401K is administered by a bank they cannot use those funds to lend out or borrow against. So they are very conservative and very low leverage. Most use no leverage. 
Let’s play make believe. Say that Bakkt opens doors and starts catering too 401k providers. Those providers offer it to employers. Then a small percentage of Gen X reallocates 15% of their funds to bitcoin. That’s is a whopping $1.2T. Then let’s say millenials add 30%. That’s $2.2T into bitcoin. And that is before any new 401K money is added. After that with the same amounts put in. That’s $50B a year of new money coming into just Bitcoin. That is half the market cap we have today. HALF!!  The best part is none of this money comes out until these ppl retire. And that won’t start till 2040. 
Now why do you think Facebook, Apple, google, Amazon, Microsoft, and Netflix are leading the market. Because that is what Gen X and millennials are investing in. If bitcoin becomes 401K eligible thru my employer I’m going to reallocate at minimum $100K out of my funds. Why? Because it contributes to the stash I hodl now. It’s in my best interest to contribute.

It won’t be none of that. The system will be designed where most ppl will never use the mainchain. Just like most ppl don’t use L1 in the current banking system. Most ppl don’t use L2 of the current banking system either. So worrying about blocksize being raised is mainly because you don’t know how the current banking system is. In order to keep bitcoin as trustless as possible we must allow for the most ppl available to run a node. You can raise the blocksize as much as you want and it is still going to take atleast 30 min for you to be able to spend what you just received. L1 for bitcoin is a poor way to provide for payments. We’ve known this for a long time. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 23:15:35
Not really. You must understand how parts of the US financial system works. From the worker side each one gets a chance to contribute a part of their earnings to a tax deferred eligible retirement account. You can also invest in an IRA. So having qualified custodians is a must. These types of accounts are not for using. They are an easy way for ppl to save for retirement. Anyone who tells you about rehypothication or fractional reserves clearly are not telling you the whole picture. Millions of Americans use retirement vehicles. As of today with just 401K assets it stands at $29.3T. And within the retirement vehicle sectors it’s $85T. 
So why would anyone want to exclude bitcoin as another way for Americans to save for retirement. Why? Because they do not know. And they take what is happening to gold as what will happen to bitcoin. Retirement accounts are heavily regulated. Each asset is backed by the money coming in plus whatever gains or interest income. Just 1% of that money flow into bitcoin is huge. 
And just because bitcoin is held in a custodian account for retirement purposes. Does not mean as an individual can’t just go out and buy some themselves. Think of that. By buying bitcoin you are increasing its network effect which will increase the value of the bitcoin in your retirement account. 
When the ppl behind Bakkt say they want for Americans to be able to buy bitcoin in their retirement accounts. This is what they are talking about. $400B a year of inflows of new capital. I’m not trying to say there is any downside due to financial terrorist and the games they play. But what I am saying is it will provide support to the new generations in the American work force to be able to save. 
And yes Bakkt is 100X more better than some little ETF. Why? Because an ETF will buy a certain amount and then that is it. But retirement accounts will buy btc as money is allocated into the retirement account. As projected the 401K balance will grow from $29T to $44T by year 2050.

That’s a good topic. And I’m sorry if I missed the true intent. At this point in time bitcoin doesn’t serve as a unit of account except for in the crypto space. And it’s wild at that. I think anyone who even sees bitcoin in that sense or any other shitcoin is very delusional at best. 
In economic terms you have to relate to this not as demand and supply for goods and services. But demand and supply of btc. When you add more goods to the supply chain, you will need a higher value of btc to meet the demand for buying that good. At some point the price may get to a point which shifts this demand to spend to a demand to save. At that point goods produced will decrease. As the goods decrease the price of btc will fall because savings will accumulated to the point it acts against economic activity. Which in turn will make savers want to invest more to spur more activity and produce more goods. This in turn will increase the price. It’s inflationary or expansive and deflationary or retractive. Depends on how the markets will weigh in on it. But this is a long way from where we are today. A few decades will pass at that point. We will see the most gains in our lifetime and future generations will see the stability. 
My last note is the world will need more than just bitcoin. Even though it will be more widespread. But by having 3-5 different currency choices it makes the levels of corruption harder to achieve.

Actually both of you are very mistaken. It’s been engrained into many to not trust the SEC. on a whole they have done a good job. Most do not remember the latest episode where the SEC actually saved retail investors from being fleeced. Before the Financial crisis some Wahl Street actors took many Chinese companies public doing what we call a reverse merger. This was not a new practice but many companies in the past never used it. But many companies got listed on the basis of being in China. Opening the gateway for Americans to invest in Chinese companies and China’s growth. All the innovation coming out of China and being listed. They must have raised over $30B in funds. 2 years later and many stocklemon warnings from Andrew Left 99% were halted. 
The same thing is what is happening today with crypto and Blockchain. It’s just a new generation of investors and scammers. Actually some of the same scammer investors are in crypto as they were with reverse mergers. These people make a living off of the grey area. But why did it all come to halting. It was all blatant non transparency. These companies were trading their own stock to pump the prices. Sound familiar. They all had analyst including CNBC promoting these companies and the gains they were making. Sound familiar. The financial sector news reported highly of them. Sound familiar. They had heavily followed yahoo message boards. Sound familiar. 
What is going on right now as it was in the past is nothing new. It is the reason the SEC was created. Scams like this has never changed since the 80 plus years of the SEC being an agency. The only issue most of you have is you are too blinded by the gains. Most of you still hodl bitcoin at an exchange. Most of you trade shitcoins. And now your shitcoins are down and you really think they have a chance of actually surviving. But those are the same ones that have self interest if not being transparent with investors or the SEC. instead you want them to give you a pass. I’ll give you a hint. Most of the scammers sold a long time ago.

So spirited. It takes ppl awhile to undue the construct of money. But once you get it. You really get it. I know once I did a lot of things in my life were different. I call it a re evaluation. If or when 1 btc can buy a house it may not be enough for me to part with 1. Which is strange because I used to give btc away so people can understand the technology. But when I woke up I was grateful for what I did but resentful for not understanding the whole picture. The pizza guy ouch. But he is still around too. 
My advice to many reading this. Buy what you can afford. Don’t sacrifice an essential in your life either. That will put pressure on you. Set a schedule on how often you will buy. And stick to it. You are not going to miss out. Don’t focus on the price but have an objective or goal for when you will spend it. Dream big. Never tell anyone including relatives how much you own. Remember that. There is always someone out there who will if you give them the chance try to take them from you. At this point we call them altcoiners. Learn how to store your coins off an exchange. And keep multiple copies of your seed words in secret locations that only you know. Keep up to date at what is happening on the protocol. This is important too because Bitcoin has been under attack for years. This is your money and under no circumstance do you fall for leadership. Bitcoin has no leader. Also understand you are not going to get what you want when it comes to making changes to the protocol. But you don’t have to accept what devs, miners, or businesses think is best for your money. Run a node because that is the only way you can ensure the rules you agree to are true. But if you can’t accept that you are trusting someone else. Ignore the FUD, lies and deceptions from those who really aren’t going to act within your best interest. This maybe your government or those who you place a lot of trust to. Lastly, read and learn as much as you can. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 13:23:55
Not your keys not your coin. It’s really not too much of an issue to write down your seed words and store them somewhere. Never keep them on an online wallet. The trade off is not enough to justify if you can’t just write down seed words. You are your best security

Warren Buffett didn’t buy stocks for no reason. He bought stocks to get rich. I really think he used a simple timed strategy that won’t be repeated for as long as yields never reach 20%. I will stress this because bonds do matter. As yields decreased the price of the bonds increased. As the price of bonds increased the price of stocks, houses, cars increased. Warren bought insurance companies. Why? Because he could invest insurance premiums. It’s a free loan. As long as he bought goods that maintained pricing power above the performance of bonds he was good. That’s why he stayed away from tech. Tech is deflationary even though you can get lots of free cash flow. That’s why he won’t buy bitcoin because it is deflationary. It removes his ability and pricing power on insurance and banking.

It’s goes along the same lines as not your keys not your coin. They increase the noise to signal ratio also. The losers become better because they are tied to the winners. The markets used to be about the reward of properly allocating capital. You can see the same thing happening in our markets. All coins and tokens move the same. It used to be when bitcoin goes up everything else would go down. Now when bitcoin goes up everything goes up. And vice versa. So as with an etf are we seriously allocating capital to get systems built or is it just the return without anything being built.

Plain and simple as tested LN can do far more transactions per second than any blocksize increase. 
If you are one who wants to look at what supposed side has something better to offer. Than I’ll tell you it’s best to choose BCH for the simple fact of having any thought there is two sides.

I don’t know about you. But the thought of ICE doing Bakkt is amazing. Even the ETF’s are too. I’ve been around a while in bitcoin. I could never imagine this back in 2012. Yet I stumble onto this and see just how critical you all are of bitcoin. Have you ever thought that these entities want the same thing we do. 
In 2014 there was a lot of talk about bitcoin going to 0 also. That didn’t work out. Maybe it’s those from 2017 who are still mostly up thinking their investment in btc is getting close to 0. My advice is give it time. Learn something about bitcoin other than its price. Many great things are going on with the mainchain and LN. Try some different wallets. Discover how to run a node. Attend a dev hackathon if you get a chance in your area. Network at Bitcoin meet ups and meet some maximalist. Buy a miner and join a mining pool. What I’m saying is get involved outside of reddit.

Let’s get this straight. Crypto is NOT bitcoin. Mostly all of crypto is centralized. These projects including ETH are hiding in the guise of being decentralized. Being decentralized is not the key to not being a security. We have partnership structures. Which most of crypto falls under. 
Having the SEC involved has nothing to do with ownership or control of a partnership. But it does provide investors and users a safeguard. That’s why we have lock up periods. That’s why pre IPO holders have to register there positions. 
And no this does not apply to bitcoin. When it was released Satoshi DID NOT take money from anyone. He just released the software. 99% of crypto could do the same. But they didn’t. 
@_date: 2018-05-09 03:45:30
I don’t get why anyone says “better technology” in reference to bitcoin and after. It’s delusional at best when you think compared to the past technology in banking and money. Bitcoin is leaps and bounds ahead. It is the innovation. It is the better technology. 
In the past even with the card systems it started out as 3-5 business days for clearing. Today, you see the money come out but the merchant does not get paid until 21 days later. Or when we were on checking systems. That was 2 weeks no matter what to clear and overdraft was a huge money maker. Better yet being on a cash system. Deposit one day and it didn’t show in your account for 3 days. That’s why people mainly held cash on hand vs having a bank account. This is all financial tech that dates back to the 80’s. 
Satoshi created a basic protocol. It’s no frills but has science built into it. Block times of 10 minutes is long enough for peers to sync with each other. This time is very tolerable. But shorter times would mean peers would have to have better equipment just to stay in sync. A whisper broadcast network is justified by minimizing collusion between peers. A predictable coin count and release schedule. This is very important. Because not only does it serve as a reward to participate. It also makes it easier to identify who is cheating. 2016 block difficulty retargets to dissuade coin creators from inflating the supply quickly for an extended period of time. Or in the event of a 51% attack the 49% of miners can go offline and blocks will take longer real time for each one to be produced. This was the breakthrough. 
All others are just a derivative on this concept of what Satoshi created. Lastly, by Satoshi leaving established bitcoin as the one. It forces humans to deal with its own nature of greed and corruption. As long as you have more honest nodes Bitcoin can last for centuries. Anyone can talk or lobby all they want. In the end it comes down to the code that is running in consensus with each other. There is no one person or group that can influence the direction of what bitcoin will become. 
The other coins will all succumb to the same fate as fiat. Because they all rely on trust of someone. They all rely on influence to get them in places. And this maybe the reason bankers and VC’s flock to them so easily. But in the end the kings get replaced with a better king. Bitcoin has no king to replace. 
Markets are the weakest point to all of this. Because well funded players can and are trying to justify other coins as better by price performance. But this is normal. Every reserve currency that gets replaced is done in parallel with the new currency replacing it. This time takes between 20 to 30 years. Or the birth of 2 generations. Humans will need a period of time to adjust. This is now happening as we speak. We are living it in real time too. 
Now what solidifies bitcoin over others. Look to the past when the internet was in the same situation. You had competing implements. Some were backed by large corporate interest. Why did we pick the one we use today. It was the World Wide Web. After that the other internet protocols just faded to irrelevancy. So LN is the moment of truth for the whole industry.

New big money is in a pickle to say the least. If the price goes lower bitcoiners buy. If the price stays the same they hodl. If they price goes up they hodl. The only coins available are from traders. Which is not even a big amount either. 
Even though there is 1800 new coins a day from block rewards. That amount doesn’t even reach the market. Miners don’t pay for electricity everyday. They don’t pay employees everyday either. Some miners do other coins too. That’s what they sell to pay the bills. So whether it’s big money or Wahl Street they are going to have to lower their expectation and just pay higher prices. No one is really selling.

Pat yourself on the back. Did I hear you say LN will be great because then altcoins can apply it. Well there you go. Nothing entitles an altcoin anything that bitcoin has.

Your favorite coin may not have the engineering support that may deem it worthy.

It sounds noble to say you get paid in bitcoin but really get paid in fiat and use bitcoin as a way to save. You can offer your services for bitcoin but most bitcoiners have a hard time parting with their coins. I’ve recommended this to many business owners and all have benefited from this strategy. All of them still buy coins to this day at any given price. So do I.

No they are not. The Chinese reverse mergers started in 2005. It took until late 2009 to get the markets to halt all securities listed thru a reverse merger from 2003 forward. 
Also, the stock market uses what they call compliance. Each exchange gets certified and after that they self regulate. The first line of defense against fraud or investor misuse is always at the exchange level. And the SEC monitors the exchanges for remaining compliant. If the exchange cannot address the issue then the SEC investigates a security. But at that point they are not going after a security. They are going after the principled actors inside the security. 
The issues that crypto exchanges have is they don’t have a consensus on self regulations. Some exchanges are in it to list as many as possible for a fee. And the fee is usually the first pump after listing. So the exchange is trading against you to cash out. If they all were into self regulation then that would not happen. 
Now the rest of the world is looking at the CFTC and the SEC. They all want to know what the US’s stance is so they can adjust if needed. And the US has looked to other countries to see what they are doing too. But don’t expect these regulators to fall for rhetoric to protect your token or coin if it has an applicable law that it falls under. Right now they are giving you a chance to get out. 
This does not apply to bitcoin because it’s been stated numerous times by the CFTC that bitcoin is a commodity. Bitcoin is regulated as a commodity. But when it comes down to it all you hear is crypto maybe a security. They are talking about everything except bitcoin. If you hear the SEC they do distinguish between bitcoin, bitcoin like, and crypto. And when they say crypto they mean anything that is not bitcoin or bitcoin like. And what is bitcoin like. Any fork of bitcoin from the code like BCash, or bgold.

I don’t think a recession should matter. Think of owning a coin as a right to participate in the protocol vs a stock that gets impacted by economic factors. As long as the network grows then the price should follow. My analogy to this: when the tech bust of 1999/2000 happened the internet did not stop growing. Even though most of the companies failed or lost 60% of their value. 
To answer your question directly I don’t know what the price will be but the protocol itself will continue to grow. And as long as it continues to grow I will continue to buy coins.

Nodes do play a very important part to the system. They enforce the rules. Each person who runs a nodes has a ruleset they wish to follow. If enough nodes all agree to these rules they come to a consensus. If a miner or a pool decides to break these rules of consensus within 100 blocks they will lose the mining reward. Nodes can also ban other nodes for not following the consensus too. As for developers pushing
out updates or new code. Nodes do not have to run it. Especially if it will break consensus. So if you ever hear anyone coming out saying Bitcoin will do this be very
skeptical. If you have the ability the best thing to do is to run a node. That way if any authority or government says bitcoin is banned you don’t really need to worry. They don’t make the rules for you. You don’t get paid to run a node but it insures that no one can ever change the rules you want to follow. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:42:34
Plz stop this. A node is a node. And no most miners are not nodes. They just generate coins. You are selectively choosing the text you want ppl to hear. Does an ASIC come with storage to record the chain. If so then why don’t we have a million or so nodes on the network. When pool mining took over the function of a node was separated. Nodes with wallets were separated from generating coins and block creation. You can repeat as many times till your face turns blue. Nodes are storage devices. 
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:33:20
Specifics are assumed wrong. After, the split or coup the next mission is to get listed on practically every exchange possible and as fast as possible. And there is one thing exchanges don’t like. It’s unexpected forks they have to devote resources to without getting paid for it. Then you have all the wallets to that may or may not have tooling for splitting the coins. 
It’s not just miners can wake up and split bitcoin because they are under the impression they are in control. They aren’t. Nodes, wallets, and exchanges have to be involved. So the grand scheme of things are not what you suppose they are. This is why BCash is the last and only bitcoin fork that got any economic support. They paid to play.

@_date: 2018-05-14 00:30:28
Doesn’t work that way. Even if you hardfork to reclaim those coins you’d have to get all the nodes to run that code. Just writing software and or having miners support that will not mean nodes will follow. It does not mean nodes will run that software either. Any change that comes to bitcoin requires all the nodes to come to a consensus for that change to happen. Nodes enforce the rules. Nodes get no reward for what they do but are always rewarded for the safeguard and best interest in the protocol. That’s why it’s important for users who don’t mine or run a business to run their own node. It’s in your self interest to know your money will not change unless you agree to it. That’s what separate Bitcoin from all others. The group with no incentive makes or breaks any intention of those who have an economic or technical incentive to change Bitcoin for the benefit of themselves. 
If any miner, developer, financial institution, education center, business, government, or regulator downplays the worth of anyone being able to run a node. You need to consider them any enemy of Bitcoin. Peer to peer means just that.

Ok they steal the private keys. But from where. Then why should my node who follows my rules be affected. You are saying that a quantum computer system is going to mysteriously steal a private key that is located on your device not the Blockchain. Let’s not be an alarmist. There is no centralized database that keeps all the private keys. The only ones that are close to it are the exchanges. 
Next if I was going to steal anything with a quantum computer I would use it against the banking system. There is more to gain. I might false flag against crypto to get bankers talking and gloating while I’m stealing from the banking system. Or even better I’d create an account with the central banks and just create money out of thin air.

It would cost enormous amounts beyond what IBM has. They maybe able to attack the network in some local locations but not the whole network. And breaking the encryption of the network will only allow them to double spend their coins every 10 minutes. And seeing this may persist for a few blocks the nodes can identify the attack and reject those blocks. The quantum attack is no greater of an attack than a 51% attack.

The segwit wit nodes don't just take segwit tx. Plus miners can process this version but won't be able to exceed what ever the standard node will take. That 1MB. But segwit nodes can handle up to 4MB. SO without the 1MB nodes the node chain can handle up to 4MB. BU nodes would have to change to 4MB too. The only thing keeping the chain at 1MB blocks are the nodes enforcing it. So please spare me the not secure stuff. If you don't want to read the code it's your own fault. Nodes enforce the protocol. But seeing you BU guys are so blinded it's disturbing. Read the code. See how big a block can be if all nodes were segwit nodes. Now the issue is how long would it take for the standard nodes to change to segwit nodes. That is the question to really know. As I said UASF gives miners a first look approach in the wild. Users get an enhanced experience. It's a win win. Should have just signaled for Segwit.

When you buy Bitcoin with RMB then send Bitcoin across the world. No RMB leaves the country. Also most US bitcoiners don't buy btc from china.

The offshore markets are open to countries that don't have exchanges either. So once again another focus on china. Let's get out of make believe and look at the reality. The largest economies for Bitcoin and its use are outside of China. They made the world cheap toys and stuff. Now they are exporting btc. Once it's all gone it's all gone. Now those miners are going to have to deal with those countries with strict KYC/AML laws. Any Bitcoin on a Chinese exchange is now just a stock.

Let's not get go this decentralization and blocksize issue. Bitcoin acts as a commodity when it comes to the block reward. What will drive decentralization will apply the same as other commodities. The price of Bitcoin. If the price doubles more people will be driven to mine. The risk reward is greater. At $3k per btc more hash will come online. Yes more miners. If the price drops to $500 miners will shut off. Not all but those who have more time to break even on mining cost. Lower prices will lead to centralization. On the merit of a soft fork or a hard fork, a soft fork is backward compatible. A hard fork is not. Too many keep playing games with words. Semantics!!!  Segwit increases the blocksize for upgraded nodes. The old ones won't be affected because they will still get only 1MB of data max. BU allows for continuous consensus changes. You signal what size block you want which is the same as voting. Some miners may just want 1MB blocks to drive fees. And if they don't have the majority hash they don't get high fees. It's democracy. But forcing the will of the majority with something like this is unjustified. Democracy does not work all the time. Democracy causes debates and division. And we are talking about code and math.

Nodes are not switching to BU. BU is deploying more nodes. But then you have to get wallet support. How many wallet providers have built a BU client? Then who wants to be on a chain where a small group of miners control everything. What about off chain transactions. There are no developers even considering a BU compliant off chain. I say let them spend all the money they want! It's not about mining. It was never about just mining. It will never be just about mining. Do you really think people are buying btc and running the price up because of what the miners are doing. The exchanges could care less. It's about the demand for btc is higher than the supply of btc. If we had 1/2 the mining power the markets wouldn't care. Everybody beyond the miners only care about supply and demand for btc. 90% of the btc aren't even in China. Coinbase is the most critical part of Bitcoin. They hold the keys to 20% of the btc in existance. Not $100 millions worth but $3.2B worth. Coinbase supports Segwit because it gets them to LN and off chain. The only thing miners have supporting them is the exchange price and the block reward. But instead of trying to grow the community they keep buying more mining. It's very stupid. Just continuing the debate is very stupid. Merchants and users want off chain faster tx. And as far as I know no one is developing anything compatible of that nature for BU.

Luke's proposal is a neutral proposition. If you don't agree with the hard fork then you choose the soft fork. The two are not the same. What we have now is not the same. Core is asking the miners only even though they have a majority of the community preparing for Segwit. BU is asking for a hard fork which means the whole community chooses or not. BU has a higher burden to deal with. For what blocks where the miners decide how much the nodes have to bear. What's next with the emergent consensus when the largest hash miner decides to dictate to the smallest hash miner. It's all speculation from there. More active players are preparing for Segwit. Even though they don't get to signal for it to activate. It's time for miners to look at the big picture and not just the scope of mining. Core implemented a fee market and it works. Every transaction gets monetized. Now Core is trying to get malleability out of the way to provide for off chain transactions. That's what the community wants. Off chain will still be Bitcoin. It will make it more robust. As you can see miners are not dictating the price. The higher the price goes the more miners that joins in. That is proof blocksize does not dictate decentralization. The price of btc does. Because the block reward is high enough to take that risk on. The high fees are not cores fault either. If users want lower fees then the market needs to lower the price. But the higher the market price of btc the higher the fees. And now the discussion is over attacking the minor chain. Let's get real please. Users use bitcoin to make transactions. Miners process those transactions to place in a block. Nodes confirm and validate those transactions to store. Markets price the value of the economic system. That is Bitcoin. Emergent consensus sounds great but it's actually the same as a central banker saying what the rates should be. And you see how that is working out. It never has worked out. This debate needs to move on beyond miners. They have 3 choices to choose from. BU, Segwit and the status quo. A large part of the community is coding for Segwit as a soft fork. Too many of you developers and miners can't see beyond the trees in a forest. Quite frankly you're acting like central bankers.

Oh no my friend it's not just the money supply that's the problem. You know what happens to labor when a fixed amount of goods are desired and countries have no borders. Supply of labor goes up. Labor wages fall or stagnate. Then you wind up with what we have today. Where the jobs went even those people didn't get raises. It's called dilution. Then add in inflation from the money supply. Those same goods cost more and no one from labor gets paid more to buy those goods. It's a rich mans dream. That's why globalism never worked. It will never work. It's wage arbitrage on a global scale. And guess who supports it. Yes the government. Why because they can tax you. Or make you poor to have to rely on them for a basic living. Look those boomers all thought they were getting a great deal. Cheaper socks. Cheaper tv's. Cheaper laptops. Cheaper cars. Everything was cheap till they came for your job.  Governments are in on it. They will never adopt Bitcoin. That's why we left the gold standard. All the countries wanted to be paid in gold. So when the US finally went to true fiat guess what. All the money they printed wound up in the economy. The US government lied about how much money they really printed. Then that was the inflation. Milton Friedman told everybody. Inflation is just printing more money. Who controls that? Central banks. So now they try to subvert the real economic system by creating debt. And who is going to pay it back. No one. The reason they can't pay off the debt is doing so causes inflation. Same goes with raising rates. That means it cost more money to service the debt. Either way it causes inflation. So please don't say 40 and under don't know what inflation is. They do. And when Bitcoin really starts to make a difference governments and their banking systems will do anything they can to keep the price from getting out of control. They are doing it to gold and silver. Davos and Jackson Hole are them coordinating on how to control the global money supply. It's not coincidence that they all want paper fiat to disappear. Listen to the sheep buying btc and posting on Reddit. China this. China that. Adoption! I'm going to tell the truth. China is distributing btc to the world. They don't use it in their country. And the people who think they have all the mining and those exchanges are mirages. When someone does buy pizza or a car in China for btc then it will change my mind. Other than that who really owns Bitcoin. Coinbase! They have the keys to millions of btc.

This is a positive development. Because it takes or shifts the aura of control and distributes it by necessity. As being opt in it also allows those to get a look first approach vs being lobbied to get action. Boy Bitcoin is truly unique in a sense that a true community of developers work tirelessly to make this possible. It's a volunteer army of coders. I really like the explanation of what is really going on. It seems every week a new development for positive improvement comes in.

You are comparing a company to something completely different. Bitcoin is a protocol. It has its own medium of exchange. It has its own infrastructure. If you are reaching for Apple to Apple comparison then it's PayPal vs Coinbase or Bitpay. If PayPal wanted it could leverage its market share and use Bitcoin too. The barrier to entry is open. When looking at the price of btc. You need to account for the commodity, infrastructure, fees, users, economy, use cases, supply and demand for btc. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 23:33:26
Here's a market perspective. The miners should not ever really decide on bitcoins fate based on the investments they made. They get a block reward. They are being subsidized. Developers DO NOT determine the price of btc. The market does. So their opinion of what is going to secure their investment via code changes is trivial. They get a block reward. Decentralization as proven through the years is not a function of the blocksize. It's a function of the price of btc. Same goes with any commodity. The higher the price the more risk people will take. We just witnessed an oil boom. Then a bust and 45% of the miners went bust. Bankruptcy!!!  Fees are another useless argument. It's an arbitrary setting. 20 Satoshi/kb. Well if the price of btc was $1M then each transaction is $20. So once again that fee is determined by the market. The higher the price of btc the higher the fee will be. With btc at $10k fees will be 10x higher. Basically the formula being used prices out the developing world. As for Segwit, it escapes the fact that old nodes will not have to upgrade. It fixes transaction malleability. Blocks will be bigger just not for the old nodes. It does discount the data and miners should not worry about that. They get a block reward. They are being subsidized. They are guaranteed income till 2140. So what does a simple HF to 2MB do. Nothing. It will not increase the miners income. The more blockspace available will drive down fees. It will not fix malleability. BU approach to increasing the blocksize is very detrimental. It does not fix malleability and gives them control over what the nodes take. It's a power shift. Then it gives miner oligarchies the ability to vote with their hash. So small miners will have no power to stop or limit the blocksize. It's tranny of the majority. Democracy by size causes victims. Bitcoin needs to maintain that separation of powers. Miners should not just be able to go out and buy development for what they want. They need to stick to mining. So BU being funded by mining interest is a conflict of interest. As for the rest of the community. We are all waiting on segwit. Point blank. Some of us will welcome a chain split. Then we can get segwit without the conflicts of interest and the tranny of the majority protocol. No other altcoin has the built in infrastructure like Bitcoin does. It's not just easy to just switch in reality. BTM's don't sell altcoins. And do you think those operators want to spend more money to update there operations for an altcoin. That's not realistic. So what needs to happen is all those involved need to get in a big room together. Then those who want segwit stand on one area. Those who want BU stand on one area. Those who want a simple 2MB blocksize stand in one area. I'm not talking about just miners. I mean node operators, miners, merchants, wallet developers, investors, businesses, and the like. Get them all in a room so they can see where the economic majority lies. They don't even have to talk to each other. Just stand. We all know what all the arguments are. But getting to see people in person together reduces the nastiness. I'll leave with this. Smart phones are not great because how big they are. Nor the clarity of the camera. It's the damn App Store. Music, movies, and games. The more you can do with it the better. Innovation with Bitcoin being limited to the blocksize shows really how amateur the people you are dealing with. Some do have lots of money. Call them lucky and right timing. If the code is too complex for you get a better education. Software industry standards don't apply when you are dealing with paradigm shifts. Economic value and ideals too.

Why is it the miners decision to determine the blocksize. Why not just let nodes do that? We are the ones storing it. Sure we make no money for what we do. But does that really matter. We make an investment with no payback. Our cost curve is infinitely negative. So allowing us to decide on blocksize matters will signal to miners blocksize controls is not there matter. If they want it to be place some nodes out and try to get a majority. But they won't do that because they know they won't get paid. They know a network of 1000 nodes will cost them thousands of dollars a month just in internet fees eating into their mining profits. So since they have no incentive other than profit generation you should leave the blocksize matters to where the responsibility lies at the node operators. We store the blocks for a loss.

It's not the storage space for some. It's the data usage. In the US data is chargeable. So if your node is set to 100 then you will be receiving 100MB max from the other nodes off the chain every 10 min. That's 600MB every hour. 6 GB every 10 hours. If your ISP has a limit to throttle your connection at 300GB per month then that means anything else you use the internet for will be performance reduced. Like playing games or streaming. And most providers charge anywhere from $75-$120 a month for that. So at 2MB per block the numbers just double. Somewhere the blocksize will increase to where you have to be using a business line at the lowest tier. In my area that starts at $150 a month for double the through put. My 8 TB drive is good for a long time but my ISP throughput limits how many nodes I can relay to.

I think an ETF for a single instrument is pointless. It's wall streets way of extracting money from investors. If an investor really wants to gain access to BTC they have many avenues to take. It's the same thing for gold but different. If you want to own $5M in gold then you need expensive storage. If you want $5M of btc all you need is a $100 trezor. Giveiving access to institutions is a myth. NOONE said they can't buy it as a asset. Wall Street types want an ETF because they know they can use it as a vehicle to manipulate the price without having to sign up on an exchange for Bitcoin. Then you have to see that you can't just buy coffee with shares of an etf.

Visa is an off chain payment solution for the banking system. There was a time when you had a bank card to buy things and it would take 3 days for the transaction to post to you account. Then you had to worry if the store took the card you used. Comparing Bitcoin today with what the fiat system has today's is not the same. It became pretty common in the early 2000's for your bank card to have several payment networks on one card. Today it's just visa PayPal and MasterCard predominately. Do you remember the star network. Or AFFN. Pulse. Those along with Visa were all on one card. Even individual stores had there own cards with a spending limits. So going back in time the fiat system has evolved and centralized drastically. You can't really explain that to a 20 or 30 year old because by the time they used a card we only had visa and MasterCard.

Core doesn't believe mining is centralized. That's a BU talking point. BU wants miners to have more freedom. Here is the reality. They get subsidized to process transactions to put in blocks. That is there main function. The blocksize should be determined by the node operator not the miner. Nodes get no financial rewards. Their leverage is storage space. Why do they want to treat nodes like they don't matter. People outside of mining buy those. They are separate. Nodes secure the Blockchain with redundancy. If a miner wants something in the Blockchain beyond what nodes rules govern it gets rejected. Nodes confirm and validate what miners are doing.

That's not true. The same pools are getting bigger. The other pools outside of segwit are holding the same position no change. Then you have to look at what BU is calling for. It's a hard fork. Consensus in a hard fork is not just miners. It's nodes, exchanges, wallet providers, the whole community. I'm telling you this is not how to force your code. Look we have the majority mining hash folks. But only 500 nodes. No wallet providers, No BTM's. No exchanges. No merchants. Do they not understand what they will be asking the rest of the community to do. They are asking us to trust them. They are telling us that nodes are insignificant in the consensus. It will give colluding miners the ability to fork off miners they don't like. The only thing between total chaos and reality is full nodes will only accept 1MB blocks. Miners have no say in that.

Decentralization and blocksize is a myth. We have more mining pools now than in the past. True it's concentrated in china but the cost of electricity is cheaper too. Mining pools in china are outsourced adventures. Some pools don't even own a single miner. They just operate the pool. The actual miners come from all over the world. They are not all Chinese. So what does cause decentralization. The price of btc. The higher it goes the more risk people will take to mine and get a return. The same happens in the oil business. When the price is high we have more rigs drilling. When the price is low less rigs drill and centralization occurs.

You can't hold onto something that doesn't want to be held. I understand. It makes no sense to dramatize what is expected. It makes no sense to compromise when the conditions to compromise change. Basically we have to sit back and let them keep adding more hash power amoungst themselves till they are ready to split the chain. It gives them comfort and confidence that BU is growing hash power. If 51% is what it takes I think we can all wait for malicious miners to chain split. How the markets will react is different? I think most like me are buying and hodling waiting for the fiat world to go back into a recession. Bitcoin is the exit. I took it.

This is not true. A hardfork requires input from all involved in the protocol. It's not just miners. Nodes, wallets, and BTM's have a say in a HF. That's what makes it so dangerous. You have too many reason to make mistakes. A soft fork only requires miners to signal support but it has to be basically everyone. No changes will be needed to nodes and wallets. Do you would think all miners would appreciate being given the honor. They don't. That's because you have malicious nodes acting within self interest. They are all repeating the same conflicting arguments. BU gives control of the protocol to the miners. Think about that. Nodes can't reject anything. Whatever they want. Just recently a miner made a mistake wink wink. But the nodes did exactly what they do. They secure the Blockchain. Not the miners. They why that block got rejected. With BU miners will tell the nodes what block it will take. Then you run the risk of being fee coerced. You will have no other option than another coin. Who is working on off chain solutions for a BU version. No one is. Will BU fix malleability. Who knows there is nothing on the test net to go by. They only show how good bigger blocks are.

Not true. You still don't understand. Capitalism is an economic principle. It leaves the control of prices into the hands of a market. But it doesn't define the medium of exchange. Just based on supply and demand. Price levels are determined by the desire or lack of a good or service. Monetarism which is never discussed is what inflation relies on. By slowly increasing the money supply you have people not wanting to hold currency. It devalues slowly over time. The problem is when goods respond to inflation but labor prices don't. It slowly erodes your purchasing power. The longer it persist it leads to imbalances. Which means producers/ investor benefit from inflation yet consumers don't. Basically labor gets robbed of the fruits of their labor for the benefit of the owners. It also leads to waste because overproduction happens because supply or the lack of it determines prices in respect to inflation. They have been trying to tweak this economic model since 1912. Everything is manipulated against labor. Globalism is labor wage arbitrage. Understand Bitcoin is a big threat. Apples could cost $5/lb for eternity. Supply and demand fundamentals dictate production and consumption levels not prices levels.

Full nodes are set to 1MB. Nothing above that limit will be accepted. What BU does is allow miners to dictate to full nodes what the blocksize should be. You dismiss the notion of what powers nodes have. They enforce the blocksize. That is what this debate is about right. The blocksize. With segwit miners are not voting on a blocksize increase. The old nodes will still get 1MB blocks. But Segwit nodes will be larger blocks. They will be larger than just a 2MB. hardfork. And transaction malleability gets resolved.

1. You don't have to involve any banking to exchange Bitcoin. 2. Latency is a farce. Fiat exchanges are custodial exchanges. That means you don't own the stock but they do on your behalf. Speed of a transaction doesn't mean quality. It just presents more risk. Localbitcoins doesn't operate on speed and due to humans belief systems they think P2P is not an efficient market. But it is. It's a true market. Not just flipping. Traders don't want trade quality. That want trade efficiency. That means the ability to get in and out of a trade. But btc is different because unlike a stock or bond you can buy coffee with it. You can own it on your own behalf. Just like Bitcoin is rethinking money it's also making people rethink trading an exchanges. If you further limit the time to buy and sell btc. What you'll find is lower volatility. Because someone is going to remove whatever liquidity the exchange has to buy a burger with it. I really think actually 5% of all btc is being traded daily. 95% is being held or used to buy stuff.   But this is my opinion. And if the exchanges really wanted to test it they could create a condition where hodlers will sell. Lower prices will only make hodlers buy more. They understand fixed supply. So raising the price is the only option to get those whale hodlers to sell anything.

I understand your frustration but this is truly not a Coinbase issue. CB is solving a problem for these merchants. At the moment there are solutions to this that don't involve CB. They are supported by CB. But segwit is still lingering without getting the miners support. That's where the whole problem lies. Merchants will continue to deal with the bank of CB till the protocol gives them a better offering. And when that happens you won't have to worry about that anymore.

Inflation is theft. That is what we are saying. When relation sets in then the opposite effect happens. Problem is there is no deflation. They are always printing money. The rate of inflation is also distributive. Which means more inflation will happen for those who earn less. If you are a producer or investor it shields a portion of your income from inflation. That because they are price makers. So they price goods at inflation plus profit. Inflation is part of the cost of goods to produce. But if labor does not earn inflation they are being robbed from. Work is energy expense over a given time period. If you produce 2 pegs this year. The amount of energy it takes to produce 2 pegs next year is the same. But if you consume 2 pegs this year the next year it will cost you 2% more due to inflation. That means you have to become 2% more efficient or make 2% more for the work you do. But when they globalize it creates a bigger market for producing pegs. Each requires the same work. But the cost of labor varies. Cheaper labor prevails. On the consumption side producer don't decrease the price for the cheaper labor. They consider that difference profit. Then factor in inflation and the cheap goods you think you are buying goes up each year. Milton F said it best. Inflation is just increasing the money supply.

Problem is Bitcoin has no leader. Just by mentioning that reveals the true intent. You want BU to be a leader. Buying into more hashing power is an attack. You have 50% of the miners who STILL aren't signaling BU or segwit. So the question to ask is why. What do they really want. It surely is not BU nor Segwit at the moment. But thanks now we know BU is not about consensus it's about LEADERSHIP. Sort of like having a president of Bitcoin too.

Actually it's good. China has lots of risk. Why should the rest of the world suffer for there government. Bitcoin doesn't belong to China. And the more people who feel that Chinese markets are important then the more they think they control the price. Coinbase has 5 million users. Just imagine if each owns 1.5 btc. That means Coinbase has the keys to 7.5 btc. That's almost 50% of all btc in existance. And there is less than 5 million more coming over the next century. So tell me if China is that much of a significance. And there are other wallets out there where people own and hodl too. My figure is 5% of the btc available are used in trading on the exchanges. The rest is by hodlers. The market price just doesn't reflect what the price should be. The market should be trying to find what price those hodlers will sell to distribute those btc they cherish so much. And it has nothing to do with China. Give me a $100k coin and I might sell. Funny as it may seem I'd be happy if Roger becomes the worlds first trillionaire.

Here is what you don't understand but I'll clear it up to you. Bitcoin is decentralized and permisionless. You don't need anyone to approve of you joining. The model is not a compliance based system focused on a hierarchy top down structure. In a nutshell it's a mess. That's what makes it work. Your questions of teams and incentives are legacy mentalities. Currently there is a power struggle going on. It's game theory. Luke concern with centralization is just that. Miners in some parts have different pool names but they are under the control of a single entity. And that entity believes the focus of Bitcoin should serve its purpose above and beyond first. It's to control who does what. But that is not how Bitcoin is designed. Miners don't get to decide their interest above the users. Bitcoin is a peer to peer network. Not a miner to peer network. All the devs in the community are working on things to get into the protocol. It's not a wasted effort even though under the current consensus rules progress seems slow. Miners wanted a blocksize increase and it didn't happen. So what. You can't always get what you want. They most important part of Bitcoin is 21 million. That is concrete. Miners don't have to mine. Devs don't have to code. Users don't have to buy and use Bitcoin. Merchants don't have to accep Bitcoin. Nodes don't have to record the chain. Everything is voluntary. And as long as we keep trying to move forward we can still benefit. No one really knows what will happen if we do this change or that change. If non of this makes sense to you. Then join the club. That's Bitcoin.

No he's right. Inflation is the expansion of the money supply. High inflation means there is not enough money in the economy. Low inflation means there is too much. But what we have today is from printing and capital flight. The euro and the dollar are great exports. But if those euros and dollars return home we will have a problem with inflation. Money velocity is by nature how many times a dollar circulates. Low velocity comes from people saving more. High velocity comes from people spending more. 
The nail in the coffin for the dollar is oil. If oil gets priced in something other than dollars the whole world will return those dollars back to the US. That's inflationary. Rates will go up on the long end of the curve for treasuries. Because countries buy treasuries to have dollars.

Let's get off the 1MB stuff. Segwit blocks are larger than 1MB. If those 1MB only nodes wanted they can upgrade to BU or segwit. Enough said. BU blocks will not get the witness data just like the 1MB nodes. But they can increase the blocksize if no 1MB nodes existed. Segwit is not limited by the blocksize. Unless it has to be compatible with a node that does have a limit. BU has a limit they can adjust. BU can accept segwit id tx as a valid tx. So the point is getting those 1MB only nodes to upgrade to BU or Segwit. So the point in matter is miners need to signal 95% for  segwit and or BU. Then nodes that don't upgrade get split off with no miners to support them. You have to think how long will it take us users to use off chain solutions. It's another learning curve to overcome. And if on chain can get your tx confirmed in the first block then we are good. Segwit with BU is a compromise. The ones not compromising is the 1MB only crowd. 50%. The testnet needs to be used to advance us not to highlight differences or what is better. We just need compatibility.

No it's not. The Core side is not passionate just realistic. It's the BU side who has this passion. Since August of last year how much money is being spent to gain support just for BU. As far as I know all existing miners from July 2016 have only signaled segwit or nothing. Not BU. They are spending millions on trying to take control of Bitcoin. That didn't happen with etherum. Etherum didn't have miners join just to split the chain or force there version. This is all being coordinated and they are reinvesting the btc to get bigger. This is exactly what Satoshi calls a malicious node. BU is a version for malicious nodes. I just don't understand it. They are free to fork and chainsplit at anytime. Why do they keep trying to add more hashing. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 22:15:42

@_date: 2017-03-07 16:34:56
We can do both. This is not a miner issue entirely. Nodes can either upgrade to BU or segwit. Segwit nodes can handle up to 4MB of tx. BU nodes can configure up to whatever MB. But BU nodes will need to accept to Segwit style transaction ID's. The issue is not BU or Segwit. It's the old nodes that WILL ONLY TAKE 1MB. Over time they can phase out those without a hard fork. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:52:23
How is this possible to bear. Miners can signal intent right now. Segwit is on the table right now. Core is not blocking or preventing anything. What you are saying is. I put a 16 oz steak on your plate. Then you look at me and say I'm hungry. The food is right in front of you. Just dig in.

If you whales played along wedont need to replace the miners. We could just cause fierce competition. This ain't oil. There will never be an over supply. $10k Bitcoin will bring many new players in. New manufacturers. New pools. 
Instead we keep the price at the least marginal return based on electrical prices. Yes he who gets the cheapest electricity will win. But why? We want decentralization. Run the price up massively. Keep it there. They will come in droves trying to mine Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:00:48
I don't see it that way. We only have a few txn types. So it's not the worry of the txn type. The worry is the non segwit nodes getting more than 1 MB of txn with mixed txn types. I think this really benefits BU more than the regular miners because the max block height is 4MB. Or that's what my node says. So no matter what 4MB is the blocksize. The only thing hold the true capacity increase are old nodes. So if segwit nodes plus BU nodes are 85% of the node count it's safe to say the chain split is mitigated greatly. Those nodes will need to upgrade.

It is deflationary but currently it's inflationary. For too many years there has been the myth that a deflationary currency would lead to excessive saving or hoarding. But it was never that way with gold. People have to eat. Buy gas. Maintain some standard of living. This causes friction for people to use Bitcoin. Plus it's mainly about maintaining a certain level of purchasing power. With fiat it has led to hoarding. That's why we have billionaires. A lot of them too.  No matter what people on a small scale will hoard. So try expanding your mind to see the economics they want you to think is not best served for everyone. Bitcoins advantage is there is no central control. The supply is not trickled down from top to bottom. It's open access for anyone to convert to it. It is still gold like because it is still not widely used and at $20B market cap can truthfully only serve a very small nation. 
@_date: 2017-03-31 03:51:14
First test and review. I see many changes that need to happen. And you must remember blocksize is a node enforcement mechanism. Taking that away gives malicious miners the advantage. If it could be set as for automation node function then it's doable. But allowing miners to determine node cost/debt is never the intent. We all wants what's best for Bitcoin but limits need to be in place to protect it from human manipulations. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:43:41
Do you care about the overhead cost a oil company has to deal with. No you only care about the cost of gas. The market thinks lowering the price will lead to a decision. It won't. It will lead to more centralization. It will lead to more war. The market needs to create an environment to get competition back into mining. It's a reward for the lowest cost miners but it's a the only way you will get more miners from different countries to take on risk. You have to dilute the influences of what is fueling this civil war. Code will not force change. It just makes it worse. 
Lowering the price is exactly what Bitmain wants. They keep the influence of the miners. And they keep the monopoly going. There is no government that can legislate this monopoly out. 
Core could give a 2MB increase in blocksize. But why do that if segwit is 4MB anyway. I see it one my node. The existing miners are profitable and don't want to change. And the market is too naive to think higher prices won't bring in competition and more decentralization. 
Bitcoin will not work at the protocol level till the main influences are diluted.

I don't think people understand that nodes and miners are two separate things. Blocksize is not a mining debate. It's a node debate. So why does segwit involve only the miners. Because the blocksize is not its intent. It's a change in the transaction format. That involves the miners. What BU is offering actually doesn't involve the miners. They want to increase the blocksize. But BU wants the miners to tell the nodes what they have to accept. That basically takes away node control. Why does anyone buy a node. They say faster confirmations. But I have a node and I still wait hours to get into a block. The reason is miners have to collect the transactions first. Funny thing is miners are complaining about code development being centralized and dictated. But when it comes to who controls the size of the blocks they are quick to say node operators don't matter. Storage space is cheap. But nodes still have to pay electricity and an internet connection. So nodes have real cost and get no compensation. The return on that investment is infinitely negative. So our leverage is the blocksize. I don't need a miner to tell me I have to accept what maximizes their profits. It's really not a nodes concern how much they make. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 04:38:36

It's not uncertainty. BU has the majority hash. So the market is speaking. It can go lower just like it goes higher. Basically they are taking the profitability away from the new miners. Any miner investment within the last 6 months return is now extending in time. At $800 or lower those new miners are underwater for the next 2.5 years. And if difficulty follows it's path it may take longer. But the market has every right to voice itself. That's how it works in the real world. If oil tanks are full no need to pay oil companies top dollar for oil. Same applies to Bitcoin and they are selling the miners with the most hash right now. Outside of pool Bitcoin.com and Antpool the new ones are in for a ride. The market will push them to do something or risk never getting there money back for years. This is a big gamble. Millions of people in Bitcoin support segwit even in China. All of my Chinese friends who own Bitcoin want segwit. So it's just to say the majority hash is really a very small minority of Bitcoin. Even in China. This sub is the same as the sub in Weibo. Jihan got slammed a few days ago for going against his miners in his pool. The talk on Weibo is far more toxic than here. And BU is not winning there either. Jihan is trying to distance himself and looking to add EC to segwit. All he has to do is submit it to git and have it reviewed. I really hope Core gives it a fair consideration for review purposes and not make it political. If any group can make EC viable it's working with the many programmers that spend there free time writing code for Core without pay. But BU is splitting from within too. Don't let them fool you. They are divided between doing a hard fork with BU and another group working on just getting EC as part of the soft fork. Hard core supporters want a hard fork chain split. The moderates just want EC to let miners control blocksize and rid them of the discount. Jihan will not come out and say his intentions though till he feels ready. He takes Bitcoin very serious. It's his passion unlike RV. He's playing both sides but has a path. But in my opinion putting EC with segwit as a soft fork is a compromise. But EC needs a thorough review and testing which core can provide as they do with all submits to git. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:47:47
I see stuff like this in the oil industry. Right now we have a concentration of everything on the production side. The reason is the price of oil is below $50. We have 600 rigs running in the US. But at $100 the rigs come out. Boy do they come out. 2000 to be exact. Even the most inefficient. 
So if you want to decentralize Bitcoin. All that is needed is to create an environment that brings out the highest margin players. Some ares in the world can compete against china mining at $2000 per btc. All areas can compete at $10k per btc. Sure the margins will be lower for regions outside of china but more risk canbe taken on. More manufacturing can be done outside of Bitmain. 
This is not oil and there is no supply and demand for useage. 1800 Btc per year for three years. Fixed supply. 
At this point the Chinese are talking two ways. One they want fees. Two they want to control the block. Three they are not talking about market prices being low. The reason for three is they know the higher the price the more competition. The more competition the less influence they have. 
The market can solve this debate. They don't want too. The market can solve the decentralization is. They don't want to. The cost to mine Bitcoin is too low. Only countries with the cheapest electricity can pull it off. Same goes for manufacturing miners. Manufacturers can't compete with China because the labor rates outside of china are far higher. 
If the market really wanted to test this they could just start at $5k. See if that brings out more manufactures and miners. Then keep raising the price till everything becomes decentralized again. Moores law is at its limits. Now is the time to decentralize. Now is the time to dilute the concentration of mining in China. Bitcoins price should reflect global electrical prices as a base. That keeps the playing field level. Some countries will have a greater advantage but we won't be pricing out the whole world.

You don't get it. Segwit leads to off chain. By keeping everything on chain miners feel they have the power. They get to refuse to process transactions at will. The only shot they have to offer is a blocksize increase. But 10 minutes.

I've noticed that too. But my idea creates a win win and isn't malicious. The markets need to price btc high enough to bring on decentralization. Bring on competition to the miners concentrated in China. Take the cheap electricity edge away. If the price dilutes that concentration. It also dilutes there influence. Keep the price high enough where 5% is the highest hash power. Get more manufacturers for miners. Moores law has peaked.

At some point is key. Satoshi also talked about sidechains and this ain't for coffee. So paint the picture as you see fit. I know the truth. Do you? And calling people fanatics because of their view point just stirs the pot. Get real. We are all Bitcoin fanatics. That's how the rest of the world sees us. Fanatics. Instead of trying to bash each other I really think Core should review EC and test it. Make it work with segwit. If they are the best then it should be no problem. Make it a soft fork and stop bragging how you fixed ssl. Fix EC. Miners want it. Users want segwit. Give your customers what they want.

My segwit node says 4MB. Why do we need 2MB?  This civil war is not about blocksize. If everybody upgraded to segwit they will get 4MB   of transactions. They all know this. So it's not about blocksize.

You can't beat a cartel with lowers prices. jihan loves this price. He will love lower. It keeps competition out. Cartels don't like competition. 
I don't care what whales think. Or Bitcoin gurus think they are wrong. The market is wrong. 
You have to create a climate where people will find a solution to build miners. A climate where pools can form outside of china. Where money invested in mining will get a great return. 
Decentralization has  tradeoff. It's called efficiency. When you centralize you get efficient. Become low cost. Meaning less or no competition. We want the opposite. And the only way to achieve that is by having btc at much higher prices.

Of course it is. It's a viable alternative that doesn't have the toxicity. That's how the markets decide. By the time Bitcoin miners wake up it maybe too late. Network effect and early entry may not be an advantage anymore. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:38:52
Because you change the concentration of control. But you don't have to do any of this. The market prices out asic manufacturers. China has the cheapest cost. They also have the cheapest electricity prices. So the market is creating an environment for centralization.
Fees are not driving a competitive climate outside of china. 1MB blocks aren't leading to decentralization either. No matter what the devs do. It will be the same results. You need more asic manufacturers in order to get more mining out of china. Those manufacturers will not build asics at a loss. Nor will mining pools outside China form at this price. 
The market could create an environment where decentralization can persist. And those Chinese miners are keeping a cap on price to keep competition out.

Miners don't need to coordinate anything. Blocksize is a node rule. Not a miner rule. Maybe nodes should get to signal for only 800 tx per block. Or ECtx. Or what fees miners should take. BU is just trying to take advantage of most who don't see it. Nodes enforce the rules. Rules like the size of a block. If miners can't take that then they can volunteer to leave.

I hate to break it to me the US internet is run by oligarchies. I do about 180GB per day just for my node with a data cap of 400GB. All that for $100 per month. I could upgrade to a business cap but that's $200 per month. So hearing miners talking about cheap storage is half the story. We have to pay for internet too. And I'd hate to say what datacenter is ever going to do what we do without getting paid for it. I forgot the universities and businesses will. That's a pipe dream. Those cost will be passed on to the consumer. Then the notion of miners telling me what blocksize they want me to bear. That's a pipe dream too. If anything developers should allow nodes to vote on the blocksize or dynamically changing it at that. Sure miners make revenue and spend lots of money on miners to do that. But that is a risk they take. My risk is what a pay for an internet connection and how much data I have to pay for. My system is setup to be expanded but at the way things are going it doesn't sound reasonable for blocks to be 4MB at my current cost structure. That's 3 bitcoins a year at the current Btc price. And it appears the only ones in our camp is the core developers. Sure my node setup is good for maybe 10 years worth of data at 4MB but over the course of 10 years that's about $40k. That's a nice car. It shames me that people think a payment layer or a settlement layer is even a talking point. To me it's just data that I have to store for a long time. And being told by people who spend millions for mining that oh storage is cheap I've got a bridge to nowhere to sell them. BU and flex transactions was always a non starter for me. I want full control of my data usage. I don't want some mine operator anywhere in the world to tell me how much data I have to pay for so they can make money. And I'm not the one who falls for saying miners secure the Blockchain. We secure the Blockchain by being redundant. That is the crowd source decentralized built in security. It's called redundancy. I have to agree with 50 other nodes. Who have to agree with x amount of nodes. We need to change the conversation of this blocksize debate. It's not about mining. It's about nodes. Move the coffee and drug sales off chain and off my node.

As I said in other post there is a cure. The cure is not lower prices. Lower prices keep competition out. If the miners involved are looking to take over the protocol it's easier when you have little or no competition. The market is making this more risky because they are pricing out competition. The market is enabling this condition. The market thinks if the price goes lower then they will drop out. They think they are punishing them. But they aren't. Bitmain controls the production of miners. Does anyone not understand this. We need higher prices to break the cartel

How will miners make more. By driving the fee market to zero. Where is a study or any evidence that bigger blocks for a smaller fee will generate more revenue. I think BU if it happens will just increase the blocksize to 1.1MB. This is not about blocksize. It's about control. BU doesn't want progress. And by saying we have the most hash rate is not convincing enough to the rest of us. And nothing less than 100% of the COMMUNITY (not just miners) makes any HF contentious. 
@_date: 2017-03-27 23:44:51
That still doesn't negate my point. In all cost plays a factor in how any commodity producer acts or reacts. Blocksize is seen as acost to miners. But they get ablock rewards to offset cost. It's this very mechanism of reward that the markets price profits. Markets do price useability but in the long run it's about profits. The higher the profits a miner can make. The more tendency for others to join in a take the risk to make a profit. Getting others to join in is decentralizing. As the price rises youares tually punishing existing mining pools because the simple notion more pools will form. Just this mechanism punishes existing miners because it dilutes the reward potential even at a higher price. 
Some here neglect to realize when you buy or sell Bitcoin, you are buying and selling Btc. Not miners or block sizes.

Segwit and or BU are a compromise. I don't see why it has to be all segwit or all BU. We have to move beyond compromise and test compatibility. This is code. They are either compatible with each other or not. I'm just asking to see what is the effect of running the network without the 1MB nodes. Just BU and Segwit. It's the best of both worlds. Without the 1MB nodes BU mines would have to settle with the discount. They could move the blocksize to 2MB to compensate for that. But that means Segwit blocks can handle even bigger blocks but will be limited to whatever the blocksize BU nodes will take. BU blocks just won't get the witness data. But they will be able to raise their blocksize as needed. And as long as that block doesn't exceed the limit for a segwit node it's all good. Just how big can a block be if all tx were segwit id tx and only segwit nodes.

Here are my cost to run a node
Internet pro rata use $38
Electricity $5
Equipment annualized $4
Roughly $47 a month
Revenue monthly $0000000
This is for 1MB
Above 8MB I change from 40 node connections to 20. Then I could save bandwidth. At 12MB I'd have to upgrade to a business tier plan at $160 a month. That is all without any revenue. Miners get a subsidy and nodes are nothing but debt. Yet mining pool operators want bigger blocks to get more in fees. They are different from miners in a pool. They combine hash to get the block reward. Out of the reward it pays the operator and for electricity use. So think  about that from my perspective. Pool operators are wanting these bigger blocks because it is there reward or profit. So the miners pay all the cost. The pool operators get risk fee money.

I'm trying to tell them Yoda. Lower prices will not cure this. Generals don't fight wars with less soldiers. They always need more soldiers. It cost money to buy soldiers. At this price we won't get more soldiers. We won't get more manufacturers to make new soldiers. ASIC soldiers are only made by Bitmain. No one else can compete. So if the market really wants this civil war to stop. They need to set a price where other people will make new soldiers to fight. But the market is stuck thinking Bitcoin is a stock or something. The problem is not when we disagree. It's when we agree on something. That's when we are really screwing everybody. Regime change is an agreement we can all agree on. We are getting there.

Why not just let the segwit nodes overtake the old nodes. BU nodes can then change to a 2MB limit without having to hardfork. This allows for miners to run BU or segwit. BU node limits the system then but as long as they don't exceed 4MB then it's a win win. All of this can be done as a soft fork. BU nodes will also have to be able to accept segwit transactions too. This will also allow the sidechains to develop. It will take years not months before users start using sidechains on a massive scale.

Actually this debate comes to a resounding halt if and when those 1 MBS only nodes are a insignificant part of the network. Core has been inclusive to them. But let's not forget without them BU could raise the blocksize as segwit allows for a capacity increase. All of this can be done as a soft fork. Your data center point is well taken but who is going to want to retain the chain for free. No one. And the more data intensive Bitcoin becomes then the limit of storage becomes more valuable. I could see data centers somewhere down the road but not after just 1 decade. Think in the lines of 6 decades later. Those data centers will have to find a way to monetize there services in order to operate. That is reasonable. But for now keeping it with the home gamers is a must. Bitcoin is still very young.

Bitcoin as a protocol can be somewhat centralized. But have a centralized authority it can't. That is what BU is striving for. Being bitcoins central authority. Look at the Federation. E gold was structured the same way. I'm pretty sure Adam could explain this to Roger and Jihan. They were too young when this stuff happened. Will Bitcoin survive. Probably so. Will unlimited survive. NO. I don't care as much as the block size or scaling when it comes to lose of freedom. Becoming a political prisoner for fame and envy is not wise nor smart. The community is so divided that will make it easier for the US government to get who they want. Let me get this straight. Creating a central authority of any kind for Bitcoin is forbidden.

My node which is a segwit node says 4MB. Segwit is the high ground. If we hardfork to 2MB then add segwit that means blocks canbe as big as 8MB. This is not about blocksize. It's about the power to create money. Core devs and miners that run core code are in the way. Anyone that supports a fixed blocksize is in the way.

I hope he does win this scaling stuff. Roger wants a centralized coin he can have it. Here is his problem though with a centralized coin. The US government has a monopoly on the reserve currency. Any centralized company will get the full force of their laws. Which means Roger will go back to jail for a long time. The day one terrorist is found to be using Roger coin is the day he will be charged with aiding and abetting a terrorist organization. Contributing to terrorist activities. And the US will come after him. They put Charlie in jail for a website. Hat do you think they will do to the president of BU coin. It's a sad road they are venturing on. He won't even be looked upon as a hero against the tyranny of governments. China nor Russia will not give him any hiding place. Japan will lock him up so the US Feds can pick him up. These people along with Roger just don't understand what they are dealing with. Satoshi spoke of this and early investor or not he didn't understand that. He wasn't there. So please Roger and Jihan continue and pursue the fame and notoriety of having your namesake tied to Bitcoin as the leaders. Real people the US can put a face too. And once they lock you up you will understand why Satoshi cut ties. And your coins and property will be seized.

Not BU. I caught that too. I need another bad of hodlcorn. He said patch over segwit. I think he understand segwit is not just 1MB. If you can dev a patch that doesn't require a discount it's gold. They could mine a segwit tx with witness data and a defined blocksize increase. I repeat no discount for jihan. He could signal segwit then Core could give him an olive branch. New devs are in play. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:33:43
What makes it non compatible. I mean from a node perspective. Can they not accept segwit id tx. And if segwit is backward compatible then that means BU is compatible. That means BU nodes will have to take a discount on segwit id tx. But they will be able to change the block size. And the larger the blocks BU moves to the more tx segwit nodes can do.

Bitcoin is a very hard concept to comprehend when your life is determined by governments and central banks. They haven't come to the notion Bitcoin doesn't want to be ruled.

That's not how it works. BU is done through a hard fork. This means they have to have 75% of the community for the change to happen. Not just the miners. 80% of the nodes are core and signal segwit. 73% of the wallets support and signal segwit. At what point will everyone realize that BU is not a soft fork. It's a hard fork which means NO MATTER how much mining hash they have it means nothing. A full node referendum requires EVERYBODY. Segwit and BU are two different changes. BU needs to triple the nodes and get a majority of the wallets before it can ever activate.

Not true. Not true at all. Some old nodes can't relate to newer nodes. 
Why? Because they don't have the witness data. Then there are not many of them left. So maybe they should get a clue and upgrade. 1MB nodes. 
All device makers understand at some point in time old technology doesn't need to be maintained or supported. I can't even use the original iPhone for iTunes. Do you think Apple cares? No they don't. Neither should we. 
Core really needs to explain this and make it clear. Bitcoins direction is moving beyond 1MB. Any node for whatever reason at a predetermined date will get split from the chain if they fail to maintain or upgrade to the newest software. They have many to choose from not just segwit.

So here is the reality. Miners with the most hash rate will not determine what is Bitcoin. The white paper is a blueprint of thought. The real Bitcoin will be determined by whomever supports versions. If the exchanges don't support a BTU coin then it's an altcoin. The minority hash rate can be Bitcoin. It's whatever we accept as the real Bitcoin. Plus BU is a hard fork. You can have all the hash rate you want. If you can't get nodes, wallets, service providers, exchanges to buy in its a chain split from the selfish miners. Satoshi
Never said the selfish miners maybe the majority hash rate. From what we are going through the miners can't dictate to us what we want to be Bitcoin. I have btc and I will gladly use btc that allows for security and diffusion of control over the protocol. Blocksize is a node issue. And BU allows miners to dictate to nodes what the blocksize should be. What happens if all the nodes want 500K block size and miners want 2MB. THATS NOT A SPLIT YOU WANT TO SEE. Miners can deploy their own but lose to security of decentralization.

Payment channels and off chain solutions won't make tons of money per tx. And a presentation I saw said the max tx would be limited to a fixed amount. Not all transactions will be doable on LN. It's for micro transactions. $50 or less type of stuff. Me buying cigarettes doesn't need to be on the Blockchain forever. Nor should I or the merchant suffer a long confirmation over $6. It's selfish for any miner not to respect that. It's also disrespectful for developers only coding incremental blocksize increases. As for a node operator the only thing that limits me is bandwidth. I'd have to change my internet plan after 4MB. But hell I could always sell data access to the chain if needed. And focusing on the lowest denominator for access has never worked. If the internet was held back so third world countries could have cheap access, we wouldn't have an internet. But LN offers cheap tx for third world countries where people make a Bitcoin standard fee in an hour. 
And it's not just LN. It's Teechan, sprite, thunder, and many more off chain solutions to compete for our Bitcoin business. But only one Blockchain. With 2 billion users all this off chain stuff and 4MB still won't be enough. So it's best to say segwit plus EC is best. No more fixed block size limits. Also, no more on chain only.

Actually once institutional investors come into play. That’s when you start to go up the hockey stick. Institutional investors are very risk averse. There is a reason they are going into bitcoin. It has almost 10 yrs of a track record of doing what it does best. ETH and other cryptos benefit as a tag along but most of them have not been de risked. And when they say they will add other cryptos doesn’t mean next week or even next year. They may need 5-7 yrs. 
As for younger generations being part of what is to come is a good thing. But if they are not wise and humble that wealth will disappear. Just like most of it did in the ICO run up then dump.

Because you get that with segwit. And you get more. Malleability gets fixed. 
The support you get from BU is from mostly the split up of Antpool. The exceptions are slush and Bitcoin.com. Miner support is only a part of Bitcoin. It's not everything. 
Soft forks are opt in. Hard forks are take it or leave it. Chain splits create two coins.

This is incorrect. What the bill is addressing is no different than when you choose a credit transaction. At which point you have to show your ID for the cashier to verify the name on the ID matches with the card. This is different than with debit which comes with a passcode. I do admit the bill is useless because enforcing it will get you the same results as with swiping a credit card. And for all things equal in order to access your wallet not only do you have to have access to your phone or device, but you can set up a pin code for when you spend. Thus there is no need to show ID at purchase point.

No it’s actually true. Visa, MasterCard, Square, and the rest could roll out LN systems to each merchant they serve. They could provide liquidity to each one for a fee which the merchant won’t bear unless they are sending a payment. Even if it is a few satoshi’s the volume alone could make it worth it. Consumers could use a hub with liquidity provided by Visa and never know. But the fee gets collected by visa for providing the merchant with a way to use LN. And the merchant gets paid in full in seconds. 
The only risk they would take is if there is no demand. Then the cost to roll out this would be a loss. But they can always give users an incentive like a discount.

They are signaling. Big difference than running code. How many miners signaled for BCH. But it still happened without some signed piece of paper. Code overrides agreements. Bitpay has already tried to fool people into running btc1 ( the code). They got called out for what they did. If miners and nodes really wanted to have 2X then they would be running btc1. It does not require you to signal. It is a flag day HF. You can talk and politic all you want. Run code. 
Maybe the reason no one is running the code is because they are distracted by BCH. Or maybe they just don't have any confidence in the development team. Or it's both. Most likely the latter. 
Making sense vs signing an agreement is just you rationalizing. Any whale or government that holds btc has 50 entities they can point a finger to when and if they lose money trying to use that software. What risk are the investors taking. Huge risk. 
When a viable LN wallet happens I'm using it. Before this HF happens I'm going to have BTC in a LN wallet. This will shield me from the recklessness of Nov. I can still buy coffee and snacks. I can transact as usual.

The premium is a major distractor. But see it this way. You are enabling more ATM’s to be deployed by paying the cost. And when more ATM’s come online within your specific area that premium will come down. It just takes time. Also, unless you are looking at selling or spending then using an atm is not a good option. But if you are using it to hodl btc for a long time then the premium is a small price to pay. And they are very convenient.

Stop saying China. You don't think other countries in the world have Bitcoin too. The millionaires and billionaires that have Bitcoin to them it is a store of value. They have lots of money. It's just some asset class to them. Kind of like the globalist elite telling everyone lies to dictate them. Do you ever hear them talk about buying shoes or airfare with Bitcoin. You don't. They don't have any interest in bitcoin but as a store of wealth. Us little guys want segwit, LN, Teechan for a better user experience. These guys are just some hedge fund money managers. All of them could fund or loan retail brick and mortar outlets in return for accepting Bitcoin. But they don't. Only one I know that doing any legwork is Roger Ver. say what you like about him but his heart and passion is in the right place. The developers are fighting to get the protocol updated to enhance our experience. It's for the merchants and users. If anything the markets have got it wrong. Bitcoin is not gold, or a store of value, or even a hedge against your national flag currency. It's P2P payments. That means you buy stuff with it. It's about filling up blocks. Paying miner fees. Waiting 8 hours to get confirmed. Allowing for people to make international transfers for commerce activities. Getting paid in btc. Don't let these guys hi jack our Bitcoin. How many full nodes do they have. That's the question to ask. I don't care about what they think the price will be. Billionaires and millionaires put some full nodes out then I'll take you seriously.

The bitcoin testnet has been attacked before. Last month a single project basically made it unusable because they were testing basically a way to attack main net. Why do they attack the test net vs LTC. Because it really cost them nothing to slow progress from devs working on btc. Also, in order to deploy something new that requires a consensus good luck. Miners and nodes on LTC don’t want devs putting bugs into their chain to be exploited.

I'm migrating slowly to that also. I just got with bitwage so my earnings from work will come into Bitcoin. My bonuses will still be fiat but that is only twice a year. I also stumbled upon money transfers to. I'm doing 50 Btc per week and growing for the large Hispanic community we have in my town. All I said was Bitcoin and one by one they started networking to me. I don't make that much but it's never at a loss. I show them the market rate and then purchase at an exchange immediately. I get $15 per transaction. And as for those who say it's hard to use. It takes on average 20 minutes to setup a new customer and show them how to use the wallet. Even the security features. But I've got a grocery store that takes btc from me. A gas station and a few restaurants. I think it's only a few of us who use these stores for btc transactions so I think they are keeping them and not changing to fiat. The only thing I can't get paid in btc is my mortgage and utilities. I'm not complaining. Something is better than nothing. Most stores I encounter that will take btc are independent ones. Mom and pop stores. They even give me big discounts for my purchases. Probably be cause the price has went up. As a hodler I only save from my money changing services. Now that comes to 2-3 Btc per month. But if you can find a way then it's better from my opinion. I like buying things at 1/2 off all the time. But that only started happening after a year or so of going to the same store. Big bonus is most of their employees at these stores are hodling and using btc too. So the network effect in my area is growing.

By the time you transfer fiat to the country and pay the fee to start trading it will be more to buy there. But if the spread exceeds $85 you will make a little profit but not much. Plus it will cause liquidity to dry up on there exchanges. The point is to sell yuan to buy dollars and Euros. BTC is a transfer vehicle.

The problem is not the miners it's the nodes. With 70% of the nodes accepting segwit and 10% accepting BU. It's just that 20% of nodes that are 1MB ONLY. Those nodes need to upgrade to BU or Segwit. Segwit nodes can handle up to 4MB. BU nodes can be configured to 4MB. Segwit nodes can handle tx from BU. BU can handle Segwit tx. We are debating over how long to keep those 1MB ONLY nodes and they are less than 20% of the chain. They need to upgrade. They have a choice Segwit or BU.

The volume in China is that way because they don't pay fees to trade. The spreads come from how much it will cost to move fiat around. Euro and US markets may not show all the volume but that shows greater value than what shows in China. It means people are investing in it and finding a use for it. Look at the growth of transaction per year over year. That is more important than any market volume. Look at the fee growth. If you are thinking this is just some stock or gold it's not. It's a peer to peer payment network. The market is just a part of the Bitcoin economy. Not everything.

Nothing in Bitcoin will be out of the box ready. It will be little steps forward for decades. LN is not an app. It's another protocol on top of a protocol. These do take time. But stalling or preventing them from happening is not good. Sure the main chain works and you know how to use it. But it's just not enough to fit the par. We built planes then decades later went into space. Now we are reusing the rockets to drive cost down. We went from candles to light our homes at night to lamp oil. Now we have led lights. I remember sticking quarters in a pay phone to make a call. Now my pay phone sits in my pocket. No more quarters. Don't deny the facts at how technology progresses. It took how many failures of this technology to be founded. Many have tried to make true digital money without a third party. Anyone who thinks that just making blocks bigger is good enough is always going to be on the wrong side of technological progress. There will be failures along the way. But falling back is not the right answer.

What kind of learning experiment is this you say. Here is the math. 8MB blocks will give BCH 24TPS. That's if you have enough demand. Basically, fees will be very low for a very long time. But the trade off will come from nodes. Bandwidth needed for this demand will increase by 8x. Storage cost will increase too. 
Here is a thought experiment. Say you could increase protocol TPS by 100X without having to increase node storage and bandwidth cost. At what point will it be necessary to increase the blocksize. The numbers. With segwit your TPS will be 6. Now add off chain TPS. If each onchain TPS results in 20 off chain TPS. What is the resultant. 120TPS for a 2MB block. So tell me is the cost worth it to just increase the block size.

Real people real coins. Family members in US are buying bitcoins in dollars and sending them to Mexico as we speak. China is in a bubble. I'm waiting for it to pop.

Security is based on competitive and profit forces. Miners benefit more not from having an ever endless supply of transactions to process but also the price of the Bitcoin itself. Fees are derived from Satoshi per kb. So the higher the price of a Satoshi the higher the fee. Adoption is not linked to the miners hash power. Adoption is based on users. Focusing on just what miners get is not even the whole point of Bitcoin. It's the same as how much volume an exchange does. In my opinion adoption will come from off chain solutions. The whole ecosystem will benefit from this. Bitcoin is centralized. All decision as per soft forks are left to miners. And as you can see when we do want something they don't. And that is what is holding back progress.

No. If you buy through some exchange here is what you do. Sign up with localbitcoins. Add in a price you want to sell at. Currently prices are averaging $1050. Then wait. Another way is to undercut the high fees from a BTM. Some will use an exchange price like bitstamp then they mark it up 8-15%. Then if someone buys from you leave them contact info. They will use you again. Now if a person really doesn't want to have ID being disclosed or revealed for any reason I charge an extra $200 for taking on that type of risk. P2P is where you make money. It takes some work but over time you can go from swapping 1 btc a week to 5 or more a week in about 6 months. I also sell to people sending money home to Mexico. Local prices there are around $1100 for now. So seeing the spread meets my profit of $200-$300 per btc. I don't mark up. $1000 with a fee of 0.17 is way cheaper than Western union. And the ones in Mexico don't have to stand in line. It goes straight to the phone usually within 30 minutes. So just do the leg work it will pay off.

No one wants to be on the tail end of a scandal. Best bet is establish a ACH relationship.

But I will remind you there is no guarantee the price you paid to convert fiat to btc will be higher or lower or the same.

Bitcoin exchanges don't set global prices. Even though many think China exchanges do. The price you pay is what you are willing to buy it for. And you have to have a seller to exchange with at that price. I can sell btc for $300 to $400 above the market as P2P. Some will ask why my price is so high. My response is I'm not the only one. They can sign up at an exchange or use a BTM. I'm not forcing them. Haven't had a single person walk away.

Find a BTM. Hang out a while till people use them. Sell to them. After a while they will call you to sell them more. I do 50 btc a week like this. I can't do more because it takes time for me to set up my channels to buy that much a week. Oh this took me over a year to get to this point. This selloff is great because I'm in cash to buy more.

Look I know what Bitcoin use case is. It's money. With money you can do alot of things. I'm not trapped into an echo chamber because I don't realize what Bitcoin is or isn't. I know it's not gold. Gold is physical. You may want to treat it as a stock. That is your right. I'm going to use my stock to buy coffee, drugs, sex, donuts, or whatever or whomever will take it. I'll save it too. Just like I save fiat. What's China gonna do to me. Come to America and arrest me for not using it for the right use case. Here is my translation. Use case means buying shit. That's what we do with MONEY.

I think more people are starting to understand Chinese prices are not benchmark prices. They only have miners and exchanges. Bitcoin is a P2P payment network. So without being able to use btc for anything other than trading Chinese prices don't reflect the true economics of Bitcoin. Most likely other global exchanges will price Chinese exchanges at a discount. Rightfully so. If they want to use btc to escape capital controls it's even better. They just have to understand. Those btc will never return to China.

Actually what most will call the majority is really the minority. The majority has been labeled don't care. But they do care. 52% are not signaling anything. Are they actually ok with what is going on. I don't think so. Are they preparing for signal if segwit or BU. I don't think they are. So what gives. They are the majority. Are they looking for no change. I don't think so either. The real question to ask is what do they want. 
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:00:08
But Chinese markets don't really have this almighty influence over the prices like you think. The real market is happening on the street level. The volumes and fiat amounts are lower but it's more organic pricing than synthetic pricing as in China. Then look at developments going on with Abra and Coinbase. Those are mile markers. I'm not getting your bitcoin to zero logic. Over 3 exahash mining in place and growing. 50+ exchanges around the world. 10K BTM's/ hybrids exchange systems globally. Localbitcoins in over 80 countries. 1000's of companies globally innovating for market penetrating solutions. But yet you worry about China.

Actually all major exchanges in the US have the same deal that China offers. It's a template style exchange. It's done on a rebate system. The more you trade the higher the rebate. So it's algo heaven. As for wash trades that only applies to traders who don't declare mark to market accounting. Day traders have no need for the wash trade rules. But they have to start the balance at 0 every year. No carry overs for tax purposes. As for fake trades that's just spoofing. Fill the order book up but don't execute. Makes it appear there is liquidity when there is none. So all in all Chinese markets are no different than US equity markets.

Actually in the future we will need to HF. It won't be this year. Maybe not even next year. There is only about 20 million ppl that have Bitcoin. This is in a world of 7.5 billion. Not even a rounding error. Do you really think that many ppl will just jump in over the next 24 months. 
This is not an app or a website. It's money. People have to believe in it to use it. That takes time. Segwit plus LN and a few other off chain solutions will suffice. That can accommodate up to 350 million users. Read that again. 350 million users. An 8MB block can only handle about 75 million users. That is a big difference. So in the long run what competition will meet the task of competing with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 04:01:53
As I have said, no one will use them. The token with the speculation prevents users from considering using them. My example is gotenna. It has a million units scattered around the world. Ppl are using it. It’s a mesh network which is peer to peer and decentralized. The product works. Why are ppl using gotenna vs crypto. Because the users of the project have an incentive to use the devices. And now they have a network effect they are integrating bitcoin. Why are they doing that? To get Bitcoiners to buy a gotenna unit. 
This is vs your crypto crap that has no product. Has no user network and just a token that ppl can speculate on the price. Joseph is what is wrong with this space. He fills you with hopium to drive clicks. And he doesn’t need a token to get you to read his stuff.  If you can’t find the fool in this place. You are the fool. All journalist and analyst write about crypto because they know it’s boring to write just about bitcoin. It doesn’t get clicks. There are many things going on in bitcoin and the media avoids writing anything about it because it’s boring. But it’s what you need to know.

Not many. Most of the people I deal with don't even care or follow what happens on the development side. They only care about the coin. And that is normal. If segwit fails they will have no clue about it. Nothing has changed for them. If segwit passes their wallet providers will push an update to them to support that change. They will update their wallet. That's the sad part about the consensus. It's political because the process is some what democratic. When something is popular it can become unpopular by incentive lobbying. Then it leads to these standoffs. Then it splits the community. Even though a majority want it the minority has more weight because it's the design of it. It's hard to change by design. There will come a solution for off chain tx on the scale of visa and PayPal. It won't need changes or a vote for the protocol. The miners won't like it because they have no say in it. Then more and more solutions like that will happen. It will just take time. And the Blockchain will be stuck with 1MB blocks still debating on what to do. Basically they are forcing off chain solution to happen around them without them knowing. They are forcing innovation without them.

No you let market forces take care of this. You had 1 manufacturer of Asic miners that decided Bitcoin needed to be his. The market conditions didn't support decentralizing of manufacturers. So if you wanted to mine you basically had to do as Jihan said. But the times will change. A few Russian entities are looking to mine. Ambitious enough to want 30% of the network hash. Who will be next? The Jihan mining empire will fall as time goes by. As more manufacturers enter the space. 
You have to look at forward conditions. Jihan knows his time is up. So the pressure to seize control of the code is greater. He does this not to benefit you. He does this to stifle his future competition.

Japan Lost decades do not come from deflation. It comes from population decline. Japan has constantly inflated the yen for most of this period too. Basically Japan's Central Bank super inflated the economy to the point where it seems like deflation is occurring. They just changed the definition. The Neo's tend to change the definition of things to suit there purpose. Now we all understand that inflation is the expansion of the money supply. But the Neo's don't want to admit it's actually the growth of debt. That's the money you have to pay them back plus interest. That's why bod yields will always revert to there true cost 0.

Yes but you would have to get 95% to agree before you initiate it. Then trust they will all act as honest nodes as Satoshi would say. So you initiate a HF everyone one joins in BUT it doesn't go as planned. 15% of the hashing power is split into another chain. That's when the blame game starts. That's what I'm saying. Everyone would have to be honest to execute the HF. And if the minor chain has enough hashing power to carry it will survive. Then starting a casino site and getting on an exchange will follow.

Actually it doesn't lead to Visa and MasterCards. The cost to run a hub is very low. Any store front can run one. Visa is a closed loop system. LN is open loop. This means as long as the wallet is LN supported it compatible with all hubs. Companies pay millions of dollars just to have Visa as a payment provider. They could pay a fraction of that just to use LN. It's not different than packet routing on the internet Http. Millions of hubs interconnected to connect you to a site or a centralized server. 
Anyone who says LN will be centralized is hoping to reach out to the greater fool. We went through this 20 years ago. Now a new generation is being played for the greater fool. 
By the way you know how many Visa like companies there are in the world. Thousands of them. Visa is actually the second layer for the pulse, interlink, and other networks. Basically Visa bought the main networks and tied them together under there brand.

Miners will continue to do this. Don't think they are going to act in the best interest of anybody. People will eventually migrate their btc to segwit style tx. Give it a few months. The second layer tech has to be deployed. Then after that it will take a few more months to see any progress. 
This is why 2X is not needed. Miners can still mine only 1X blocks. This has to become a reality. This is not going to happen over night.

Then you have people assuming the miners are the only thing to Bitcoin. It becomes noise. They should offer the second to least impact after the nodes.

Brought demand down. Local bitcoins and street sales are at all time highs. The blockspace is full. Bitcoin has fundamentals. Fundamentally it should be trading at all time highs not some hedge against a national flag currency. It's a peer to peer payment network.

Chinese have no trade commissions. That's why the volume is high. Demand is up everywhere not just China. I'm selling 50 btc a week locally for 12% premium to latinos sending money home to Mexico and S America. They think trump closed down western union. Now I'm their western union. Big short sale capitulated too. Plus Bitcoin has a tendency to form bubbles so old hodlrs are buying before the big run up. 
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:22:21
Thank you finally someone discussing the protocol. Market fever took over. But by design Bitcoin is deflationary. And that means saving is a human nature if this aspects. The high volume users do suffer. But not from the hoarding but from the pricing mechanism. And blockspace has become a highly debatable issue. I can be peaceful with all options other than what we have present. And from my understanding the true spirit of Bitcoin is being a peer to peer network. But it's just a Blockchain with an off chain exchanges. My impression of networks has many layers that each create the Network. Sure the Blockchain may become a settlement layer but will still function as a payment layer too. It's not use this only. And the rhetoric being used is just politics at its best or worst attempt. Why can the code stand on its own merits. Segwit is a great blockspace optimizer. It allows for more tx per block. Which means we aren't stuck with 2000 tx per block as full. Probably can get 3500 tx. There is a trade off with the discount on a fee basis but more tx per block allows for more users and a better experience. I don't really know how LN or Teechan will be but based on that rhetoric they can open doors to newer areas where speed is more critical than security and trust. It mainly can give merchants a sense of security not having to have every tx confirmed at the Blockchain. Time to confirm does create a sense of insecurity. And that is the only benefit I see from those.

The longer users are trapped into the super secure Blockchain the more the miners have control of your sovereignty. Just fill the memepool to make fees higher. Process empty blocks with the memepool filled up. For my freedom to transact the benefits to off chain outweigh the security of the mainchain. They made it political. I don't do drugs. I don't drink.

Then it moved to reddit. Then onto Twitter. This has been going on since 2011. Really. But that's how open source is. It may appear as Jeff has switched his opinion but his tact has not. 
"It was never a founding principal for greater hashing power to resolve hard forks.  Hard forks by definition can't EVER be resolved by hashing power.  If a single node remains on an incompatible fork it exists as a parallel implementation of Bitcoin.  Creating a precedent for using hashing power to fork the network is horribly dangerous and will lead to intentionally putting bugs into the codebase to force a fork for profit."
This was not the first time this was said. Same discussion in 2012. Then fast forward years later to BIP 9. And what happens, we let hashpower determine the fork because it seemed safe. But it was a bug. And Now with 2X it's the same thing. 
Let me get this straight. Consensus was always intended to be keeping the nodes in consensus.

That sounds good. But it is not realistic and there is no proof this has ever happened. Anything new comes to bitcoin first. Bitcoin is its only testnet. Even though alts want to straddle the thought that bitcoin will copy pasta from them. EOS even copies satoshi’s place. As soon as LN was made available Vitalik came out focusing on second layer tech. Now BCash is saying the same thing. I know for myself if I was going to build something new I’d do it on bitcoin first. If it works in bitcoin I might build it on something else but it may not be worth the time and effort. Here is a list of what is getting built on bitcoin as far as I know.
1. LN
2. Drivechains
3. Gotenna integration
4. Satellite integration
5. Radio integration
5. Bakkt
6. Cashapp
7. All things building into LN
8. All things being built into RSK
9. Maybe Fidelity to compete with Bakkt
10. New mining manufacturers for more efficient miners
11. New bitcoin only wallets
12. BTCpay
13. CME and CBOE
This is what I’ve heard of. And this is only on bitcoin not alts. So at what point does one stop looking at trees and see the forest. If you really looked into all things bitcoin you’d find there is no time to look into what alts are doing. Those who only look at charts are missing it while whales, VC’s, hedgefunds are actually front running institutions using OTC.

You know I don't think you really understand technology or how life works. I use a very old iPhone. And every time Apple updates it I can update mine. That is a soft fork. Now I know there will come a time when they won't support my device and that is a hard fork. If I want to continue using my Apple services then I'd have to get a newer phone. Do you really think if all these device makers would exist if every time a change happened you'd have to replace your phone. No. The easiest way to change is by doing it with the least amount of involvement and confusion. You may think segwit is a hack but all software updates are hacks. The tech world has been hacking there systems to make changes for a long time. Really! Back in the 90's nobody liked when we changed from windows 95 to 98. Pretty much everybody just went out and bought new computers. Sure the tech types just ran a cd but for the most part Dell and Compaq sold slot of computers from that. That's how hard forks are.

Things change over time. Our brains know not the subtle difference till the impacts are easily identifiable. Commodity money tends to easily replace that of fiat. It's value becomes almost constant as it seeks to be a unit of account. Currency itself trends to the most convenient means of exchange. Fiat being easier than gold. Now crypto being easier than fiat. 
Look to the past. When gold was backing the currencies it was easier to move fiat knowing there was gold. People didn't desire to transact in gold. This took many years to transgress. So when Nixon closed the gold window it was basically over for gold. 
Then fiat reigned in paper for for a few decades till cards came out. As acceptance for cards were demanded many sought to have that as a means. I forgot about checks but there stay was shorter. So coming to this day. It's the edge of anew. We are moving away from cards to more of a smart phone to exchange value. 
Look to history at how long it took for these  migrations to happen. Banks and banking institutions will either get with it or become as obsolete as the cards they issue.

Making BTC illegal won't stop the capital outflow. China has currently $1T in capital outflows a year. Bitcoin only has a $16B market cap. And that market cap comes from a global exchange basis not just what China does. The only thing this talk does is boost the Chinese egos to think they are the only thing for Bitcoin. They contribute but they have the same issue as everyone else and worse. They have no stores or outlets where they can use it. To them it's just a stock market. They don't want to be part of the P2P economy. And that's what Bitcoin is. They can do what they want. But once all those coins leave China they never come back. And in this course every week more btc leaves the less they have to trade. Bitcoin being decentralized has a sway of curing monopolistic tendencies.

If 90% of the miners leave and the price doesn't change they are screwed. It will give them a clear signal that they are not Bitcoin. Also the actual chain is in the nodes. They are the keepers of these blocks miners create. So if nodes don't change your money doesn't change. What's more important to you.

From reading the other sub it's not just the hardfork. They don't want to take credit for being the source of a chain split. The real intention is the chain split. So Core writes the code. Then the hardfork happens. Then it results in a chain split. Then they come out and say look those devs messed it up. Come to our chain. It would never happen like that with us. It's a subversion tactic.  
@_date: 2017-01-12 20:15:37
No I do understand this. But FUD from off chain markets is not what the real source of value is. Local bitcoins, BTM's sales are all direct on chain transactions. That's your demand. This stuff goes on regardless of what any country or market does. As for getting ahead of myself, these street sales will continue to grow no matter what. Fixing malleability or increasing the blocksize is you, the devs, and miners problem. It's a good problem to have though. Demand doesn't stop just because you aren't prepared. You are all acting like some egotistical elitist. Bitcoin doesn't exist just for trading exchanges, miners or devs. Read the white paper. The title is a peer to peer payment network. End users matter more than anything. Focus on end users. I'll say this again focus on end users.

Each BTM acts as a private market. Not all will give you the same spot or the same fee.

I used to trade bonds. Government bonds. It was a lot better than the stock market. Once I got on the trend it was over. But I wasn't buying for yield. I was buying for price. Then in a fit I woke up and realized it's the bond market. They are mortgaging the future. Every politician was in line with rates are cheap. From Reagan till now. At some point the bond market became the size of our economy. At some point the bond market became inflation. Inflation of debt. You get it. Low inflation is due to no one borrowing money. The government is only borrowing 1.5% of the total debt year over year. The more they borrow the more inflation. But they can't because it cost more and taxpayers won't pay more. Nor will they cut programs to not spend more. And we have a generation and a half that lives off the entitlement. You can't take away the subsidy. There is only one cure. Hyperinflation. 
This is why I see it critical to own Bitcoin, gold, silver and guns. It's the bond market that is in pre hyper inflation. I don't think stocks will fall. I really think a crack up is going to happen. Satoshi was right.

Here is what you need to know about this discussion. 
1. The mainchain is highly centralized. You have 2 companies that manufacture the miners. You do have different pools but they generally follow the equipment makers because if not you don't get miners. So LN may turn into another avenue for card payment processors. Atleast I knew you have thousands of them globally. Is that not more decentralized than mining. So if you are willing to use the mainchain then not using LN under hub centralization is naive. 
2. If you use a debit card from a bank your funds are locked up. They are limited at how much value you can use. Plus a fee to lock up your money. If you
use a LN hub guess what you put what you want into it. Not all your funds. Plus if that's not good enough just use the mainchain.
3. Unlimited transactions do scale users. It improves the user experience. That is what matters. Comparing this to me mainchain the user experience  is not that great. Why? Because the expectation of having your transaction confirmed varies drastically. It's the wait. As a matter of fact some companies have stopped using Bitcoin counter top because they expect Bitcoin to be faster or on par with visa. Also since miners play politics users become turned off. 
So here is your counter to this. Through a narrow lens things can and will appear as the writer wants. But you have to understand the intent. LN is a drastic improvement for Bitcoin. It's a lower cost solution to scaling. For 1000tps you need 30MB blocks vs 2MB segwit nodes. Choose your poison.

Just houses merchant marines and propositioned ships. Ships can move. It's the media in a ploy to control us. Just like weapons of mass destruction. US intelligence is saying N. Korea has a deplorable nuke. US intelligence said Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. 
Here is what is important. They chose a small country that is closest by sea and close to CHINA. What is the Chinese saying. You'd think the news would be announcing them trying to de escalate this. But nothing. 
Why N. Korea? Because it lies within a key significant shipping lane for the Chinese and the Russians. Currency wars turn into trade wars. Trade wars turn into real wars.

Node count and distribution matters. Transactions just don't get from point A to a miner in thin air. It propagates through the nodes. Blocks private through the nodes. 
After the nuclear global fallout you can pick up a node and pick up where you left off. Just add miners. It's that simple. But without that node guess what. You start from scratch. Think of a node as a seed bank. It all begins from the seed.

You know I'm not really opposed to increasing the blocksize. Realistically it needs to happen but not right now. And when we do raise it make it a lasting decision. Luke has a great proposal even though I don't like decreasing the blocksize to start the inflation cycle. But instead of 2X we just make it 9-17% blocksize increases up to 35MB blocks somewhere in the future. Distant future. While we're at it add extension blocks too or something more than just a blocksize increase. 
And for this it may take a year or two more but it will be worth it. We need to think in the interest of the network more than just self interest. We need to get btc1 and core developers together to give us a plan. We need to get the miners and businesses out of the decision making. They can fund it. We can fund it. 
After segwit we can actually use a sidechain to be the test bed of innovation. And that way when we do need to hard fork it's a non event. Everything gets coordinated on the sidechain then we execute that.

I did. And I’m still buying. My mindset is not on how much fiat it takes to buy one. It’s more of fiat is unlimited and bitcoin is not. So the more btc you have out of 21 million the better off you are. Lower prices help you get there faster so that is the time to accumulate more. It’s pretty easy just to set aside a fixed amount every week or month and forget about what the market price is. Most ppl I know that are doing this are only looking at what bitcoin will offer in the future vs what the price is today. If 100 million ppl did this then it’s bound to happen sooner rather than later.

Because other altcoins are adopting segwit. So you can't call it vapor ware. Not only are they adopting segwit they are doing it as a soft fork. The alt coin clones are showing consensus. And the realist part is they are not using BU. Basically segwit is fixing a lot of coins other than Bitcoin. Even to say some miners in China are signaling segwit on LTC but not on BTC. Basically testing it out on a lower risk operation. That's how you manage risk.

Traditionalist look at bitcoin as only having 21 million coins. But the truth is a bitcoin is 1.00000000. So if you want to increase the supply then you move the decimal over. Think of it as an accordion. When times call for inflation bitcoin can inflate. That means the price of 1 btc goes up. when the times call for deflation the price of btc will fall. This is over the long run. Currently bitcoin is in the distribution phase. Its in the adoption phase too. This is going to be volatile.

Power companies have a cost to produce electricity. That is factored into your cost to purchase electricity. A typical drilling rig spend on electrical power is close to .018 kWh. That includes the cost of the equipment (which they deduct for tax purposes) and gas. Some rigs even pull nat gas straight from the well to drill other holes. So the cost they are looking at is 0.01 kWh. That's what I'm talking about. Seriously Russia is going to use there cheap natural gas to produce electricity to mine for Bitcoin. And yes those rigs over there will be doing it too. They generate lots of heat.

This is just the beginning of the change. Wallets that don't work or are confusing need to improve or disappear. Merchants and crew need training I do agree with that too. And those pesky miners playing tricks and making political statements like oligarchs need to subvert their egos. Traders need to value Bitcoin by its transaction growth not a hedge against some fiat currency. So they are wrong. They are turning this into some fiat controlled government money. You never hear a single report about Bitcoin is growing in users and daily transactions. Or anything about the street level markets selling all time high volumes. Why? That's where the real action is taking place. I get on a weekly basis 5 calls about accepting Bitcoin as a business. I follow up with it and even explain setting up a wallet. Sending bitcoins, receiving bitcoins, and changing to fiat. Really that's all they need to
know. That's how money works. That's how cash works. If they inquire about more I just direct them to YouTube or read the white paper. I help with money remittances to Mexico. My cost with the fee plus $15. Real simple. I'm up to an average 50 btc a week now. That's 2400 bitcoins a year. What do those billionaires and millionaires do. Nothing. Take to twitter and FUD. WTF. Why do they need all this btc for. Yeah it's deflationary but we are still in the inflationary part. Hoarding it is not going to make the price go up. It holds back the velocity of money. And that is what makes a currency more valuable. It makes it hard for guys like me to get btc. It's gets harder and harder to buy 200 btc a month. And the market doesn't value that. It's not priced in. I can see it coming. There's going to be a run on an exchange and instead of changing to fiat they will be taking btc out. What happens when an exchange can't cover that. What happens if they can't return the btc to customers leaving?

Copy paste they public key and send it to the ledger. Try a small amount first since you are not confident enough in Bitcoin. This is very common to those who get in. They leave there Bitcoin at banks thinking it's safe. The protocol works it just takes a little confidence in seeing it happen. Seeing is believing. It's understandable. Send a small amount first. It may take a few minutes or hours depending on the fee and the memepool size. But it will go through.

The second layer phase. Some maybe centralized second layers, Some maybe be decentralized. The block size will then have to be raised again. Will the primary be a settlement layer only NO. It will still function as a payment layer for those who choose to. That also follows under being decentralized.

The cost to sending funds to your LN wallet from the main chain yes. But once the money is off chain you can open a channel. Once the channel closes funds will be in your LN wallet. Then you can broad cast to the main chain. 
Or a better example. You have a checking and savings account. All your money is in savings. You transfer $100 to checking and go shopping. As you spend the amount in checking goes down. Once at $0 you can add more. Or if you have $20 left you can put it back into savings. Or you can add more. 
There will be a larger fee to move funds to and from checking to savings. But you get security for that. Currently that security is based on a trusted third party. I watched a video of this in live action. He first deposited funds into a wallet. Then from there he opened a channel. Put the amount he wanted to spend and that's it.

They will make the price look like it has value. People actually trade penny stocks of companies that are just mailbox addresses. If your coin has no demand outside of an exchange. It has no real economic value. If you are buying BCH or 2X when it happens you are making a bet that they will provide some economic value. BCH is a chain for miners. 2X will be a chain for businesses. For this you will be given coins to use. I guess exchanges will have to come up with a fork next.

As time goes on fees will replace the block reward. But it was initially put on to block spam. Satoshi didn't give time frames but read that statement again. Inflation free pretty much means there is no more block reward. The block reward is inflation. And the predetermined amount is 21 million. Once we reach that many coins there will be no inflation ever. 
You can't conflate what he said to fit your context. The fee market by design is a flaw. Core should have set it as first in first out. That way if a miner want to spam the meme pool they can't just mine their own tx and get the fee back. You understand why the miners got mad at Bitfury for cleaning up the memepool of low fee tx. Because it was another miners tx.

That is true too. But that is not what has been pursued. Same goes to merged mining. Ext Blocks. Or any of the other innovations that sit in the pipeline. Bitcoin has a decade or more of building right now waiting. But fixing malleability is key. It opens those doors to massive scale. Too many single minded mentalities thinking Bitcoin is only going to be Segwit and LN. It's not. Let the innovation have a foundation to build on.

I'll just say it this way. The 34 and under crowd in the US is very active in politics. They are very energized by Bitcoin. Any rules that boomers make to ruin there money will be replaced when they take the reins. Demographics plays a large role in the shape of this. When the millenials demand something of this world they usually get it. Changes in the workplace happened due to them. They have devastated cable tv. Malls are closing down because they buy online. Banks are next. If they have access to it from the phone then it game over. I just hope they use the technology for the greater good.

What behavior are you talking about. Blockspace is limited. And saying blocks are not full when it's not a full or empty debate. If blocks are maintaining .80 capacity is a different environment if blocks are at .5 capacity. The more capacity taken the higher the fee perblock. Then you have to take in account the price of btc. If btc is $400 then moves to $900 the fee doubles. Even if it's for the lowest amount. The formula is Satoshi per kb. They are basically losing money on tx on higher value btc. They don't value a 2 btc tx more than a .008 btc tx. The fee is the same. Hence they can't do microtransactions because they will cost too much. They could change it but you know they can't change anything. If I was a miner I'd be extremely mad because all those 20 and 30 btc transactions are practically free. .12 to .50. That's on a $18000 transaction. If they changed the formula to % per tx like the rest of the world I don't think miners would argue or protest any changes. Fee = .005 * input tx.

How is it not the same. You go to the BTM and put in an order to buy Bitcoin for some fiat amount. Then get a receipt. Take it to the counter and settle your fiat. Now you have Bitcoin. Saying "topping up" is just semantics. This makes it no different from buying a soda. Which means you are buying bitcoins. This is why we have this scaling debate. Don't include me in it. But ideas come in many fashions. Saying this doesn't look right or that works better is a form of regulation. The end result is more users.

You can buy the ETF all you want. It means nothing. You don't own the private keys. So you don't own Bitcoin. You own a piece of paper that when you sell it you get a piece of paper. Bitcoin unlike stocks or ETF's can be used to buy things in your life. Sure it appeals to investors because investors have been trained over the yrs that ETF's are safe. They aren't when it comes to Bitcoin. It's a big risk. 
Do you get an audit of the holdings. No!  You can physically check the public keys to see what btc is inside. As an individual you don't need an ETF to buy Bitcoin. Buy Bitcoin and own it. Your private keys equals your money.

Here is what we know works:
1 21 million cap
2. 10 min block times
3. Btc inflation till 21 million is reached
So why not the blocksize. Because it the only part that's not in the code. It's not the issue and is a trap. Just set a cap on it for some future limit like 38MB and inflate to it.

It's too late. Mining has become industrialized. That's the most efficient path. But worrying or defining decentralization as anyone can mine at home is not a true account. We have thousands if not a few million entities that could fit into an industrial mining group. Every company that drills for oil. They do not live off of grid energy. They produce there own. Electric power generators can also join in. Not just hydro or green but nuclear and nat gas electric generators. 
In the world, there is 2500 drilling rigs operating. If each one had 5 pets hash that is a lot. In the middle of the US we have 870 individual power plant. If each of those had 10 peta hash that a lot. Now add in other countries. Mining will be more efficient the closer you get to the power generating source.

The problems with raising the block size is political. The 50+% of miners don't just reject Cores Roadmap they also oppose BU. Both sides know exactly what these miners want. Yet both don't offer it. It's very simple matter to say. 4MB blocks to them is better than 2MB blocks or flexible blocks. I understand this because the What if argument. What if LN doesn't pan out?  What if Teechan doesn't pan out? What if no viable off chain solution pans out for the next few years. These miners are stuck with 1MB blocks. Users will be stuck with confirmations that takes days. If someone wants to spam 4MB blocks then so be it. Every spam is a fee. You have to have some kind of cushion or margin of safety first. That's how you compromise to a consensus. Innovation can still continue regardless. They could even use Segwit as a 5.1MB block with 3MB of transactions and 2.1 for witness data. Do it as a softfork too. It's the best time to do it. But now we have block size science and economics. All it takes is a phone call or email between the two factions to increase the blocksize in segwit. The code is written already all it takes is an update.

Yes there is 80% of current nodes are not compatible. Only Btc1, Classic, and BU nodes are compatible. Also, the Fibre relay network and BitSat are not compatible. 90% of Bitcoin ATM are not compatible. The same wallets you use for BCash will be available for SG2X. And of course the miners. They may or may not support that chain. Depends on how the market prices that fork. 
If this is determined by hash rate then some Chinese miners will support that chain. They may split half and half. The agreement does not say they have to unilaterally support with all their hash for 2X. But the hash rate that leaves will be replaced by Russia. For users we get more coins. 
Personally they are co opting Segwit for selfish reason. They will co opt LN too. Any thing and everything that is open source is up for grabs for them to copy. But you have to have developers who are competent to maintain it.

Without Blockchain you can't have segwit. Without segwit you can't have LN nor Thunder by Blockstream. So 
1. There is nothing stopping miners from coming up with their own layer solutions. 
2. The miners on the Blockchain can enter into channel agreements to capture revenue to keep them running. 
3. If miners want they can promote the Blockchain to merchants that don't need fast transactions. Like paying rent or utilities. 
Exxon, Shell,BP all produce oil, refine oil,  and operate gas terminals. If the next phase is layers and channels nothing stops miners from getting in the action. It can still be P2P and then some. Plus instead of a fee market just make it .25% to transact on the Blockchain. ACH transactions are the cheapest and they run .38% to .50%. Money is not measured by blocks, it's measured by the value of the transaction. Debit transaction fees are regulated by the Fed at .21 per transaction. For $10 that's 2.1%. A merchant would have to take in an $80 receipt just to get what the Blockchain offers. So if they really want to compete in the world they need to offer more than bigger blocks. Consumers main concern when out in public aren't damn fees. No one wants to stand in line for 10 minutes waiting on a receipt. Most consumers don't even look at how much in taxes they pay for the goods they buy.

You can view an example on YouTube under ZAP lightning. Basically you send btc to your Zap wallet (channel) then you connect to another through a router ( hub) to another wallet. If a payment is going to pass through you you can charge a fee. 
The FUD to this is they want you to believe running a payment hub is going to be like running a node on the main chain. And from what I've seen these hubs are just routers. I believe the misconception stems from what happened in the 90's. Modems were frequently used. Then ISP's stepped in because they provided faster service. This centralized the internet. But LN is fast as far as I have seen. But need to see it live for a load stress test.

Because it will cause nodes to centralize. Imagine having 300GB bandwidth for the month. With 1MB and 8 peers you are using roughly 50% of your bandwidth. At 8MB blocks more than 90% off the nodes will drop off. This will not yet create data centers but someone is going to have to pay for all this bandwidth used. Are you going to upgrade your internet so miners can benefit more. You pay more. They get paid more. 
Next the real issue in Bitcoin from the consumer is not the block size. It's the time to confirm. That's 10 minutes. You have to allow for some security. 0-confirms are not that secure. So at best you will have atleast a 10 min wait. Most consumer transaction happen in less than 45 seconds. In order for Bitcoin to meet that it needs a lighter client. Exactly what Hal said in 2010. Yes that long ago. 
So how do we get this light client. You move off chain. Payment channels. LN is a payment channel except you can make many transactions before you have to settle your balance. Irregardless of what some one says, a payment channel is more P2P than actually the main chain. The miners do not have to take your transaction or if you don't pay enough you have to wait. From that perspective it's not P2P. 
But going on. In a LN channel I will pay you and you will get the btc immediately. Then you can take some of that btc and pay someone else immediately. In the end when you are done you can broadcast your balance to the mainchain. So 3 transaction will take you seconds to get. Then once you are done you can wait on putting your btc back in a block. Your fees will be less too.

Bitcoin is not really deflationary. This is all physical presence terms. There is a cap on the most BTC that will exist. But that does not make it deflationary. As a digital currency Bitcoin can expand infinitely. Just add more zeros after the decimal. That is what we will call sub Satoshi. So you have a feature of fiat where you can expand the money supply. But you also have a feature where it acts like gold or commodity money. It's currently more like commodity money.

I don't think the miners will leave. I think they will do exactly as they are now. Waiting on the market signal     
They will see where the users go too. They may decide to support all chains. The reality is miners, devs, and businesses are all competing for us. The power will always lie in the users hands. Do you really think any investor, trader or user I going to pay $4000 for a new coin because it has more hash power. People don't operate that way. The new coin will get listed and the market will find a price. As for businesses if they don't want to support the segwit only chain then that is there choice. Millions of companies to take there place.

I agree with you too. Too much emphasis is being played on soft fork or hard fork.  I understand why because some miners feel the fees are too high and will drive away consumers. This is the reason we need to migrate away from the hard fork debate. Go to segwit and lightening and drive fees that way. The ball is not in there court any more. The Bitcoin economy needs a merchant consumer economy not a miner monopoly of the whole Bitcoin economy. The miners act just like OPEC. WHEN IS THIS GOING TO STOP BEING ABOUT MINING. If you hard fork it still leaves them in the picture. What the Bitcoin economy needs is a ATM in every gas station, fast food joint, and all retail outlets. The market needs to take the price up considerably to get the miners to stop focusing on them so the REAL world can benefit from this. I understand the need to make money but in the real world people make money by consuming goods not bickering over protocol.  Damn miners could be the first trillionaires BUT don't realize this ain't about mining anymore. Let the developers INNOVATE

What Luke has proposed is hard for people to bear. They want to be involved. They want to seem powerful by reason. Let them be persuasive. The real answer has always been as Satoshi said just scale it through inflation. Get the people out of it. That gets rid of having to trust or even side with developers or miners. It just is. 
It's just insane that we are going to let future generations carry on this debate. We can fix it now. It's no different than me saying make all block 100Mb then adding 1MB every 2 years till that is reached.

Do the countries or national governments within the EU have any authority anymore. Are they going to be able to take my house because I pay for it in Euros. Are they going to get this information from global wallet providers? I don't think the US, China, or Russia is going to find that funny or resourceful. Keeping a tab on their citizens.

1. How can fees be determined on an asset that changes. Unless the fee spot is based on a daily closing trade. But typical fees from ATM networks range from 14% to 1%. It's a constant dollar per withdrawal up to a maximum withdrawal. 
2. LN or other layers can have a fee waterfall. Maybe 85/15 for transactions to prevent hash decay and maintain updated equipment as time evolves. 
3. Mining concentration migrated to the lowest cost electric provider. But older equipment can be recycled and donated to charity centers for them to run. Given the technical burden is reduced. This can be replicated at brick and mortar stores too. In a very small footprint. Or contracting with wind operators and using excess grid resources to stabilize energy waste due to lack of demand at off peak hours. 
4. Markets need a consolidated feed for global trades and will prevent the loss of liquidity or addition of liquidity. This will allow markets to compete and reduce the manipulation from any participant. This will allow arbitrage opportunities for exchange operators to keep the best bid and offer tight. 
5. Allow coin holders with 1 year or more to be able to vote on future protocol as if they represent a stake. And then having the coin holders who wish to vote an escrow with an expiration or lock up period. This will prevent polling manipulation. 
6. While we all fight corporate globalism Bitcoin is creating a global community based on choice and freedoms.

Or using a check book. A check book was more convenient than a bank card because most retailer took checks but didn't have ATM's at the store. So you had to go to the bank to get cash at there ATM. Then go to the store. 
Better yet when the banks fought tooth and nail the ATM industry because they were putting them in stores for easier access to cash. 
After that card processors cut out the ATM's by putting devices at the register.

I wouldn't do it. Here's what people in my area are doing on the weekend. They buy 10-20 btc. Then they hang out by a BTM. When some goes to use it they ask if you want to buy btc. Most people look at the BTM price then find out how much the local is selling for. The local charges 3-5% less than the BTM and gets the sale. So don't be surprised if you sink money into it and get nothing in return. My friends do this and I front them bitcoins on a weekly basis. I get around $300 per week off of 10 btc. Now I'm fronting 20 btc per week and will take home $500 a week. Which is far better than a BTM. So if you have the time or the network a BTM is just a waste. Once the human contact and relationship is established you have customers for life.

Coinbase has limits on what or how much you can purchase. I think $10k per month. You could use the exchanges like Gemini to fill some of your order too. If anything it's not going to be an overnight transaction. If you go with a miner they may want you to join the pool. But for that much you'd need a big pool. Or there maybe someone on this forum who may assist you with this for a fee. Some really smart Bitcoin people here. You just would have to vett them yourself. 
If you are going to get an adviser I'd start an account with TDAmeritrade and use their services.

High fees follows the price of btc. With Bitcoin at $1000 fees will be 27% higher naturally with or without a  block size change. Do the math for the model. And you always have to factor in the price of Bitcoin. So in the thread where fees have doubled but it is not due to the block size being limited. The price of btc has more than doubled. Once again it's math. If they want fees to be lower at this price all they have to do is cut the Satoshi per byte in half. That takes care of it. But why would they want lower fees. Bigger blocks with a fee market will always reach a limit and fees will double every time the price of btc doubles. I can imagine the screaming when the Btc price is $10K. Fees are rising got to raise the block size. Whatever. It's good to have friends who have Phd in economics that don't live off of ideaology.

And ultimately nothing will get done TILL the market puts a gun to there heads. And the rest of the community will adapt by innovating around Btc. Hybrid models are available for consumers to use.

Without the Chinese Bitcoin will still remain. If there mines turned off and nodes disappeared difficulty would decrease. But China is in a position of greater market share because of electricity prices. If Venezuela allowed Bitcoin I MINING every miner would be there hands down. Electricity is free. Once India gets on the bandwagon you will see more miners pop up there. Electricity in India is cheaper than China. Chinese pools are having a harder time adding more capacity. The Chinese are seeing it's a break even deal. The only benefit comes to the pool operator. Imagine getting 1.5 Btc for each block rewarded without risking any capital. Or collecting fees just the same. Then when a miner gets paid for the operator takes control of it. So basically pools are financing schemes for pool operators. Every trade has its own trick. It just depends on who's getting it.

Here is what I don't get. If you get paid per kb why would anyone want a 2MB block size. But then if it takes 10 inputs of any value Btc to fill 2MB it seems 4MB will double the fee. But the inputs are not all the same Btc value. So really miners will only be aligned to have bigger blocks. But the reality Core changed to block weight and now miners are complaining the fees are too high. You can't have it both ways. They are making more money for the same block size. 
Another point is miners don't understand how payment channels work. They think everything will happen off chain. But the off chain providers have to settle a consolidated transaction feed like the rest of the world. Even the exchanges do the same thing. How can you be pro exchange and anti LN. Both off chain. But when they need to settle they have to do it on chain. If every block coming from off chain was 900 Btc per block with a 25 bps fee that's 6.75 Btc per second. I'm using 3 tx per second. 12!of those blocks every 10 minute is 75 Btc. That's how you drive volume. Coinbase has partnered with visa to make micro tx fast. It's a hybrid solution but it's fast and off chain. And the fee is not based on the block size. It based on the value of the tx. 
I keep telling big blockers SCALING is not how big a block is. Nor how fast a tx goes thru. Scaling is how many people use Btc to buy stuff. Wholesale weed dealers aren't selling dime bags. They are selling pounds. Sorry but due to consensus rules segwit is dead. Miners can live off the subsidy because the market priced Btc at $700. I think at $400 market price there is leverage for them to comply.

Slush pool gives it miners a say on what code they want to run. Why don't the other pools do that. ViaBtc operator said he doesn't allow it because the MINERS don't understand the technical side.

Actually the reason why USD seems so stable around the world is because all currencies are debasing themselves at the same time. Asset values have been pretty tame. What the central bankers are doing is as whales pull out of the market they are injecting money in. It's billions coming out every month. This is how they are trying to manage expectations not inflation or stagnation. It's all bs. One wrong move in coordination then it's over. The markets will rise drastically. Inflation will kick in. If the markets crash then it's the same trend. But if the markets crack up boom hold onto anything that is not tied to fiat or interest rate sensitive. The real problem is huuuuuge. If you look at the debt issued around the world it resembles a chart for hyperinflation.

So overall what is the purpose of the 1MB. Central planners by definifition constrict the principle of free markets to decide. The issue I have is for the longest time this debate has raged on. The market has differentiated Bitcoin from the rest but this still persist. Maybe the market has decided that nothing will get done. Maybe the market has decided the only way Bitcoin can move forward is for the players at Core and BU to step away so the decentralized thought debt can reappear. Leading life by principles is a prison for freedom. My vote is with I don't care.

Yes I am. He wants the first block then you pay for it. Simple as that. There is no guarantee that segwit alone will cure that. It's a fact of how a market works. Using Bitcoin to transact is not a right or a privilege. It's a choice. If doing something in a timely manner is the choice than on chain is not the best option all the time. This applies to 1MB blocks and above. Miners decide which transactions to put into the block. They can mine empty blocks. The solution is time, thought and experimentation. The fee market may not be the best choice. The fee market may need added rules like prioritization schemes built in. Or better yet a fixed fee with first in first out.

You could use the Blockchain as the store of value. Like buy a house for 200k. But in the comments you create a crypto sequence. Then on the side chain you hold the deed. Use the private key as an index to match the crypto sequence in the comment section on the Blockchain. Hence matching something that is known to something you only know. 
Example. On the main chain you have a transaction for $200k. In the comment you type I like waffles. Then on the side chain you enter your private key that only you know. Next you type I like waffles to access the deed. Everyone will be able to see your comment on the main chain but they would have to know your private key. They would have to know what side chain it was on. They won't be able to reverse engineer it because you have the private key. The only thing they would see on the main chain is a transaction amount and some comment. So this is something that is known mixed with something you only know. The headers on the side chain will be your private key. 
The transaction speed would not matter for a deed. And the fee for the side chain can be set by a market. And payable to the side chain owner. The side chain owner can have several storage chain protocols to enhance security. A billion 2TB hard drives used around the world completely decentralized. The storage chain wil know which one the deed is at. All you have to do is goto the protocol webpage and type in your private key.

Does Tesla solve any real world problems. No! For me Bitcoin was never a factor of solving a problem. It is choice. In a world dominated by fiat and ever increasing debt it's nice to have and support something outside of that system. True there is fiat mentality within Bitcoin as for the politics, but beyond that the economy is and will be forever resilient. As for the target use I believe it will always default to the consumer. Without the consumers it's just digital gold. And some retailers see Bitcoin as little risk to there fate because it's just a small part of there business they offer. But if you listen to the investors and pundits all will say the same thing. I don't do drugs and there are few retail solutions available to me at this point beyond ecommerce. So I patiently wait. Out of 7 billion persons on this planet you can't say that 1/2 the supply of Btc is not sitting in some retails wallet. That's 8 million Btc.

From what I have researched LN fees can be low as 1 to 0 satoshis. But to get the funds to the LN you have to take the funds off the main net for a fee. Then once you close out the channel and put the funds back into the main net for a fee. What LN and other channels enable is fast transactions at a very low cost. Basically something the main net can't do. There is a 10 min or more process into a block. By comparison PayPal charges 3% + .30 per transaction. If a Bitcoin fee exceeds .60 per $10 then PayPal is cheaper. Anything above $10 in value for Bitcoin is the cheapest. But comparing it to LN both will be an expensive option. You could make 200 $40 transactions for say 200 Satoshi. At the current market price that's not even a penny. But what you do allow for is almost trustless P2P payments. From other research it's revealed at the current blocksize with LN it has the capabilities to handle 500 million users. That's a very big number as compared today. And it establishes a consumer Bitcoin network. 
Now to address the corporate side. This will apply to high value transactions to. But the main net is the way to go. They are not looking at fast transactions. But they will have faster transactions based on the current standards. Being able to make a b2b payment in the millions for .60 is a big savings. And the time to transfer goes from days to minutes. Plus it will be on a ledger for transparency. Corporations will be able to pay employees on the main net for cheaper too. Pay bills can be done for corporate purposes and consumers too. 
It's a win win all around but getting there is well debatable. I'm biased to the core path because I believe in a robust Bitcoin ecosystem. I don't believe in sidechains being separate or treated that way. If it's using btc then it's part of the Bitcoin ecosystem. You find that most are very focused on just the protocol level. That includes miners, devs, and nodes. Merchants and users are the end point. And that's where the debate really is. You can expand the protocol by increasing the blocksize. But that limits growth potential. Even with gains in storage you are still going to be working with a fixed size. Remember it gets stored forever. And having a superventer node warehouse 40 years out basically pressures becoming obsolete. Those thinking bigger blocks are short sighted. You have to think 40 years out with what we have current. Remember nodes get paid nothing. And the bigger they become the more it will cost in electricity. So that is really their burden of debt. Who wants to run a data center with no revenue. Miners need to realize that. But the other option is to expand on the end point side. That's the merchants and consumers. That can grow exponentially at a lesser cost (electricity/storage). Off chain networks whether public or private will be able to see the real dividend of the network effect. Unleash the army of global citizens. Even if you have 100's of private networks you still fit the criteria of being decentralized. But you mix in public networks too and it's the icing on the cake. That is because it creates a system of checks and balances. It creates a market. If one sidechain charges too much just use another that is compliant to the other peer. If not then just use the main net. It's that simple. You have choice. Everybody has a choice.

1MB equals 3 tx per second. 4MB equals 12 tx per second. Get real! As a full node operator I'd much rather miners get more through put too. Plus off chain to handle smaller tx. Even 8MB would be ok. Bitcoins price is a direct relationship to tx per day. With 1500 tx per second on chain and off chain combined makes a big price difference. Actually setting a limit should be left to miners and nodes operators. If someone in a poor country can't afford a bigger capacity node I'm pretty sure people would be charitable to secure there own fate by making a donation.

No it’s not. And it runs into becoming centralized 4 times quicker than bitcoin will. LTC is a carbon copy of Bitcoin with 4x more coins and 1/4 the blocktimes. If the tech is solid on it. It should be. Because it is a copy of btc. Which really makes it less useful. The only reason anyone considers it is because the confirmation times are faster. But it is with Segwit a chain with 16 MB blocks if it ever was being used and all tx were segwit.

These people will never understand. They didn’t buy the high. They bought into 21 million btc that will ever exist. Fiat is unlimited. 
Most of you are doing it wrong in my opinion. Trying to buy as much as you can in one purchase puts you in a high risk for selling when the price drops like it did. Most of you are diversifying into crypto when they all move the same. Most of you are buying into applications instead of a monetary protocol. Most of you don’t understand only one project is being built out at scale. And that is still tiny compared to the actual fiat system. 
In my view and research changing the monetary system takes decades not years. And what makes bitcoin special from all the others. There is not Satoshi or Hal. The technology gets built on by its users. The economics is organic. The foundation of what all crypto relies on bitcoin being hard to ban. And there is a lot of people in crypto that wish bitcoin would just go away. Which is ironic because nation states are just now warming up to it. Banks are warming up to bitcoin too. This is not 2014. 
Most of you are new. And what you see today in bitcoin has been in the making for years. Bitcoin is the only project that encourages its users to get involved. All you have to do is run a node. Buy what you can afford to lose. And save a little in btc. Running a node guarantees that no one or group can change the rules you wish to follow. Not even the miners. And you will have many who will never support making it harder for you to run a node. Using bitcoin is not just an app on your phone. And when listening to anyone talking about bitcoin understand this. If they are not running a node they are not a user. They are a customer. This includes whales. This includes governments and banks too. Your power relies on running code that others are willing to run. The developers will write code hoping that users will run it in a consensus. If not then it’s not what users want. 
The exchanges have the incentive to have more than one coin. They do it to make a profit on trading. And they have made lots of profit by doing so. But underneath it all they store their profits in btc. The amount they will not immediately be used is kept in btc. That’s how they keep skin in the game.

To miners on this side of the fence. You are missing out on the largest arbitrage since the Fed was created. I understand you are trying to make Bitcoin more efficient but are skipping the value side. You a reading that up to a market that has no understanding of what this really is. My advice: Stop selling Bitcoin to the market. Find some large retail outlets to work with. I'm pretty sure they would enjoy what you offer. My experience is as I go to buy beer I don't buy money on an exchange then go to a store and buy beer. I just go buy beer. So why not sell or front a retailer bitcoins linked to however you want to scale and get over with it. But instead of the retailer buying the bitcoins you supply them with prepaid tokens just sitting on a shelf like iTunes cards. And work with the retailers to offer the customers per se a discount anytime they use that card at participating stores. Then just make it where each microbit is the same as a dollar. Then give the retailer a piece of the pie like 20%. You keep 80%. Make 1 microbit the same as $1. As I said have the retailer send you 80%. Use this as there introduction. Then if you want to license to them you can because they will have fiat to go to an exchange and buy more bitcoins to reload the prepaid cards. And when you need to pay your bills in fiat you can do that too. 
Keep coming up with ways to scale without adding anymore bitcoins past 21 million but the reality is Bitcoin has a drastic pricing problem and the exchanges treat you like gold or oil. This can be accomplished online too. All the retailers need is the incentive to have their customers use Bitcoin instead of fiat. And by the time the market finds out anyone with Bitcoin BTC will seek the path of the highest return. The highest return is retail not the exchange. And when a consumer wants to buy direct from them exchange just keep the liquidity at a higher price. Let the arbitrage begin.

As hard as I find this to believe but it's really not an issue. Coinbase is being treated as a financial institution. It's the governments way of learning as you go. In the spirit of transparency the IRS is doing good. This is not a life or death situation. It's an audit. They happen. Any chance Coinbase gets to interact with the government legitimizes it even more. As for having to let them view the personal details of each customer. They are not Facebook. (Which people voluntarily divulge everything) So lead by example because Coinbase may become the standard that all related companies may be based on. I understand the fact an audit sounds bad but from past experience I myself got to learn what was right and what was wrong. I moved on with that knowledge. If Coinbase thinks you are being targeted realize this. How many companies are there you really compete with. Stand up and be proud. For the users this is a perfect vetting. If you made a gain that exceeded $250 for a tax year you owe money. My thought is if a transaction is considered taxable if Btc is moved from one wallet to another without an ownership change too. It will be good to follow these actions. 
I leave with this. We have 1 Amazon, 1Ebay, 1 Facebook. So if you fit into that one of a kind customers will seek you out.

There is really no need for a hard fork. Segwit will add bigger blocks and open for payment channels. The Blockchain needs payment channels to scale. Why process transactions on chain for pennies when a channel brings in 20K confirms and 4-8btc as the fee. Then in the future those fees grow to 20btc per confirm. Bitcoin block chain is the foundation of the infrastructure not the pipes. Look at the exchanges confirming 1k Btc and a 2 Btc fee. The exchanges are a payment channel and a pricing mechanism.

OpenBazaar has the freedom to run their business as they want to. I don't understand why everyone has to accept just one thing from Bitcoin. Stores accept visa, MasterCard, American Express, and numerous others for fiat. Plus these services cost them 3% minimum. So in the Bitcoin world why can't businesses be able to accept core, classic, unlimited, and xt. All are different in some way or fashion. If a customer comes in with a BU accepted wallet they can still transact with OB. And OB can have the transaction validated on chain. Or if a wallet comes in with segwit. OB can do business with that too. You can have tons of middle services. 
I'm just saying options are freedom. Make the wallets dependent on which miner protocol they will use. Everything in between give them everything and let them choose whatever gives the a profit. That is how free markets work.

Miners need to look beyond confirming small transactions. They will get bigger block with higher fee rewards from payment channels. 
Every day the block reward is 1800 Btc. The faster they allow payment channels to form the fee channel can provide that and more as time goes by. The price of Btc will go up. 
One example of a payment channel are the exchanges. Exchanges are closed systems but they have to confirm Btc to prevent double spending. Payment channels can't confirm Btc. Only the Blockchain can. The exchanges alone are providing 75-125 Btc in fees a day. Imagine 10x that. And when the mempool fills up from payment channel demand that's when you hard fork to add capacity to the block size. 
In 3 years there will be another halving. It would be a shame if miners are holding every one back for nickels and dimes. No matter what the only one who can validate a Btc is good is a miner. The metric to look at is Btc per block NOT block capacity. 
Miner economics will be able to control the supply of Btc in circulation when fees are equal to or greater than today's block reward. That means basically 25 Btc blocks or 3600 Btc per day miners can fight over. If they save Btc from the system the liquidity dries up. When liquidity dries up the price goes up. Then they can add liquidity to the system to stabalize the price. That's how central bankers work but they never take liquidity from the system. They only add and that's inflation. That's the erosion of your purchasing power.
Block size vs block weight. 
Block size is measured in MB. Block weight is measured in Btc per MB. By allowing the world to interact with the Blockchain means block will forever fill up and capacity will forever increase. By using payment channels they can combine all transactions to create a condition where more Btc per block will evolve. Then miners won't need to care about capacity. Why earn 3000 satoshi per tx. When you can earn 50 bps per block. And if each block contains 15k Btc that's a 75 Btc fee. I chose 50 bps because that's the Fed fund rate today.  
I wish someone would explain the economic side of the Bitcoin economy.  The future consumers and merchants won't use the Blockchain. In the future payment channels will be the demand for the Blockchain. Consumers and merchants will interact with the payment channels only. It will be fast and very efficient.

I've been in the same situation as you too. My average cost is very low. But I even tried mining and got lucky and found a block. At the time I barely broke even. But now since I haven't done anything with them it's been worth it. It's worth way more than my time and effort. My strategy is on an annual basis if it still exist I buy a couple. 
What I find amazing is the fees. I used to send a friend in a different country money through western union or money gram. I bought some land so I have to pay taxes. But at $20-$30 a shot seemed like a great deal. Last year we talked about Bitcoin. It was available in her country through bitinka. So we tried it. I transferred the same amount I always do. The fee was $0.18. I was like wtf. And it only took about 12 minutes vs the 3-5 days. 
So I've done several comparisons on a fee basis. Most ATM charge $3-$5 for up to $300 withdrawals. Visa and MasterCard is 3%. Unionpay in China is 4.5%. And my bank charges $10 per month when my balance is below $5000. So as I know there is a risk of Bitcoin disappearing I keep my savings money in Bitcoin wallet because cost to carry is $0 for any amount. 
I do wish it was more widespread and that's what I call scaling. But so far it has been great. I don't really understand why the transaction are based on sato/kb vs the amount but hell why even care. It's like a 95% discount on fees. 0.25% or less per transaction as a fee. Hell interbank overnight fees are 0.38%. I want everything to be in Bitcoin.

No huge spikes. The off chain markets are fighting for liquidity. Users are pulling the supply from the exchanges faster than liquidity is going to the exchanges from miners.

Or prices going up because supply being removed from the exchanges i.e. Capital flight.

Staking is not anything new and it centralization happens. Those complaining about electricity have no clue. Bitcoin used 10% of the energy needed to mine gold.

So why does it have to be an if and not when. Why can't one youbit equal a dollar. I know why. Because you let a market that has no clue how to price the internet of money. The community needs to stop focusing on mining and focus on retail. Instead of buying from an exchange just let consumers buy from a store. Like buying iTunes credits. How much does $1 of iTunes credit cost Apple to create. They don't even have to mine. So why can't $1 of iTunes credit not be the same as 100 satoshi. Apple is not in the business of selling dollars. They sell movies, games, music with a card valued at .00001 usd. 
If the price of Btc goes up from being bypassed how do you keep mining from expanding. Increase the cost of the miners. Electricity is not the only thing that limits hash power. Cost of equipment matters too. I'd make new miners really want to mine if I made that stuff. Who cares about how much electricity gets used. Find retailers and bypass the markets. Go directly to the consumer. Equipment manufactures raise the cost to enter. Start making low cost retail equipment for consumers to use. Card readers, prepaid cards, and stuff like that. Partner with the music, movie, and game industry and give them a cut of the arbitrage. Partner with sports teams.

You know who ETH true user is. Other developers is their users. They will create dApps that no one will really use. Just like all the apps on your smartphone. What’s even worse you will have to pay an amount dictated by a market on what you use. People tend to be price sensitive. So a well known dApps may triple in cost as its usage explodes. Then that will lead to demand destruction. It’s no different than the cure for high oil prices. It’s cute is high oil prices which will lead to more supply or less use or both. But with a dApp there will be no supply response. So prices will rise till no one will use the dApp anymore. 
The other point is bitcoin has no rulers. There will never be any group who can meetup and just make changes. Even if it’s the most powerful people or governments in the world. And that is what truly scares them and many others. And yes this can happen to ETH because the founders and influencers still exist.

 Actually the dollar crashed in the 70's. Then Nixon closed the gold window. That effectively killed the dollar. It came back as a fiat backed by nothing. But Kissinger made a deal with Saudi to only sell oil in USD. So this tied the dollar to oil. Also Saudi had to buy US bonds to hold in reserves. Also, the US was restricted from selling oil outside its borders. 
For the longest time if you wanted to buy oil you had to buy USD first. This applied to all oil producing countries. So the more oil the world produced the more dollars that were needed. 
Then you had Iraq. They wanted to sell oil for gold. Here comes the bombs. Then Libya. Same thing sell oil for something else than the dollar. And China rose in power and decided to buy oil from Russia in a RMB/Ruble swap. So we put sanctions on Russia. 
Meanwhile in the ME Qatar wanted to sell natural gas  to the EU. Only problem was Syria. Syria is a close Russian ally. No pipeline through Syria for that. Plus the Ukraine has the main pipelines coming out of Russia. So the conflict involves them too. Disrupt the flow coming from Russia

Instead of trying to maximize fees quality just drive volume. No one can beat the miners on fees. Also, get the offchain stuff started too. Beating around the bush is getting nowhere!

This is all quite true. The rich especially the old ones seem to think they know more about money and tech than anyone else does. They used to have an advantage because they got information before others did. Now with www information travels as fast as it is created. 
When it comes to money we can easily search the web on it and what it’s history is. We can read about the times when government and central banks did not control the money. The US was even founded on not having a central bank. We also understand that fiat has a short life span due to inflation devaluing the currency till it’s worthless. We understand why gold is no longer used as a circulating currency. And governments and banks own most of it anyway. 
There is nothing more insulting to future generations than an old guy telling the younger generations what they want the world to be. Bitcoin and only bitcoin is giving the people the power of money. The protocol has rules but no rulers, founders, VC’s, influencers, politicians, Wahl Street, Beijing, Russia, USA, or any other centralized entity to control it. It’s very scary to the elite and centralized parties. Until ppl figure that out and stop chasing gains we will get somewhere. And those gains will manifest into bitcoin. Decentralization means nothing if your founders are still alive. And what project will do that. None. That was the blessing given to bitcoin. And now they have stopped trying to take it over. Now they are trying to drown it out by giving a number of *cough cough* projects to compete. 
You have Billionaires and smart programmers like in ETH that will never get it. They are building Blockchains aka money protocols that someone will always control. And governments will only go so far in letting them succeed. But now they let it thrive because it’s the only thing that can tame or try to diminish Bitcoin.

I think both sides are working at the same way of getting to the same thing. Faster transactions. It's all about on chain or not. Wallet providers are providing consumers and merchants faster transactions for a fee. Btc is an asset with money type properties. So it just goes back to the mining level to provide the same thing to retain fee income. I like what Core is trying to do. I like what BU is trying to do. I just don't like the structure. The segwit softfork opens up greater possibilities. It really does. But the possibilities have to be structured to maintain fee revenue for the miners. Not a structure where miners compete with a layer. But a structure where miners compete with miners. Whose to say that some miners will want lightening and some won't. Even within a pool some may not want it either. They may want thunder. Instead of making these third party scaling solutions as layer make them SAAS to each miner. Each miner pays a lisence fee and transaction usage fee to lightening or thunder. Which ever they choose will maintain their rights. Banks do the same thing. If your card has a visa symbol on it from Wells Fargo. Then Wells Fargo has contracted visa to scale for access to your money. The merchant pays a fee to visa. Visa pays a fee to access your funds. It's a waterfall. In the end it raises the cost of goods and services on the consumer because the merchant still has to profit on each sale. 
Miners need a scaling solution for fee retention. That is revenue. That is how the bills get paid. Now there is two approaches to this issue. One needs to be structured to benefit miners not to be seen as competition. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 21:55:44
Here is my take. While the block reward is 12.5 Btc. Let's grow. Let's the side chains do all the work and then in return the miners will have a steady stream of income coming from sidechains. It will be the waterfall effect. The more sidechains the more water that falls. 
There are no downsides to Segwit. It creates 300% more in TPS. But included is the malleability fix. This allows features for sidechains and layers on top of the Blockchain. Miners get a subsidy to secure the Blockchain. It's not the whole ecosystems responsibility to ensure they make massive amounts of profits on top of that. Let the creativity and innovation expand on top of the Blockchain. Visa can have a sidechain. PayPal can have a sidechain. Western union can have a side chain. All side chains add value to the Blockchain. Lightening and many others will allow consumers and small to midsize merchants to transact in a timely manner.
I've said many times, voting for segwit is voting for scaling and GROWTH. It's not about mining anymore. If the miners in there respective countries want. They too can create a sidechain. Nothing is stopping them. But time is running out till the next halving. Stalling or halting growth will hurt them in the long run.

I read the white paper. It mentioned nothing about distributed network. It was a peer to peer network. Plus completely disregarding what the miners say gets nowhere. They are the network. From the users standpoint we want faster transactions. But now if you guys aren't listening we users are appreciative of segwit but LN no. We know what a visa or MasterCard system is. We know layers add fees. We suspect the fees going to LN is not a waterfall. And yes we like our miners no matter where they are. By the way topology wise nodes can act as the same thing as a lightening network without breaking the integrity of the network. Just need to add software. And China is becoming a unified front. So getting through them is going to be very difficult.

4% of all coins securing the network. No that's what the block reward is. It's a subsidy or welfare. That's why the focus needs to be on user growth not blocksize. If a mining machine is not economical than shut it off. Don't force more flow to on chain or raise the block size. Nodes get nothing and the only resource they can leverage is storage space. Please do some diligence on LN. Opening a channel is free. Closing a channel is free. Transacting is practically free. Who ever uses LN as a business isn't going to make any money off it. But it will help increase the user base. LN adds value by capturing more consumers. It also reduces fees merchants would pay to Visa or banks. LN is P2P microtransactions. That's how Bitcoin is going to compete. That's how Bitcoin is going to takeover. BTC on LN is cash. I say this because the reality is miner feel entitled to monetize every aspect of Bitcoin. Stick to mining. If the money is not there layoff some miners. The Blockchain is at overcapacity anyway. Mining is still in a bubble.

Bigger blocks means bigger fees. I do understand the debate. One side wants bigger blocks because the fees get higher for fuller blocks. The other side wants segwit the gateway to LN and Thunder sidechains. Sidechains takes fees away from the main chains. But LN fees are nothing. You can't beat nothing. The rhetoric used all comes down to money. So miners want a HF for bigger blocks to absorb more fees. The debate is about money.

No in the sense I'm using market cap is relative to NATIONAL GDP. It's not to translate to fiat. I could convert to equivalency to BTC but that would be very misleading because I really don't know what the market price of each BTC will be. BTC may well be more valuable than fiat and demand a higher multiple. 
Adoption and use will reach a point that will accelerate in the future. And the issues happening currently will become issues again. And boy fiat going away is a strong message. To say people are still wondering when the dollar will no longer be the reserve currency. Just like the inpatient scaling issue we should just cut to the chase. Bitcoin is the global reserve currency. It went global before it even scaled. Government hated the notion of central banks too. But they evolved. So just waiting it out is building the suspense. 
For those working on this I say I greatly appreciate the effort. I'm very tickled with the attitudes towards free markets when you really mean free exchanges P2P. Keep disagreeing that's the only way to get to the right solution.

If it was that easy. It's not. So we grow on chain so miners can make more. What about the nodes. Shouldn't they be compensated for all these TB they have to store. For what? A meal at a fast food joint. You know why ATM's only have 20's. It cost money to store money. The war on cash has nothing to do with the activity it's used for. It's the storage and security needed to keep people from stealing it. The internet didn't scale. 1 packet at a time is it. The rest of the stuff we call the internet is not. It's layers. So you have people who say this vision of make believe and call it scaling. We have a great example of how this works the internet. 50 years from now if we are talking about blocksize Bitcoin won't be around.

China doesn't dominate the Blockchain. As a matter of fact it's a benefit to use all. If the Chinese government shutdown all miners in china then more will pop up somewhere else. The hash rate will decrease and so will the difficulty. So the remaining miners will have less competition. 
With the proper infrastructure such as payment channels you can reduce risk in the event of something like china closing its doors. The consumer and merchants will be ok. Bitcoin is not just about mining. Bitcoin is global. The core purpose of Bitcoin is to allow p2p transactions without a trusted source. 
The reason I say this is because miners have clouded the true intent. They have distracted the focus to be about them. We don't need more miners. We don't need a faster Blockchain. We need a super efficient and secure Blockchain. We need node solutions and payment channels to make transactions faster. We need a few billion wallets not tens of millions of them. We need solutions for large corporations to small mom and pop stores. The blocks are filling up but if you look at the amount of Btc per block it's small. We need each block to have 10k Btc each time. And then instead of charging a fee base on kb you charge by the amount of Btc per block. We need to innovate beyond the Blockchain. The reward for the miners is a subsidy that one day will cease to exist. They are only hurting themselves by acting this way. Again bitcoin is NOT JUST ABOUT MINING ANYMORE.

Thank you. My sentiment with gold and silver too. But bitcoin is easier to transact with over long distances. I was told back in the 80’s that the US got caught cheating. France almost got away with taking all the gold. It was a speculative attack. And who knew the US printed more paper than they had gold by peg. Even the market covered it up. Till they couldn’t. And then they moved from targeting the money supply to targeting the cost of money along with the petro dollar. 
But know they don’t have anything to cover them. I wish people understood that. By the sounds of some Fed members and regulators they really want bitcoin to succeed. Yet they just can’t come out and say buy bitcoin. The system is in that much trouble.

Not really. Both approaches want to add to make the user experience better. Here is BU case. Outside of the jargon they want to preserve the network (miners). It will eventually all come down to fees. So this is where Core comes into play. Core wants to add block capacity as does BU. But Core will open a gate that will allow layers. So that means more competition for fees to the miners. At this juncture miners still get a block reward than fees. So if you add a layer now that will be fee dependent in the future there will once again be this same struggle because the miners and layers will be in conflict. So the best intent is to preserve not block what the miners have built. We know the extremes are Core and BU. Now it's left to those in between. Ver does not want miners to be coop with another layer. That is rightfully so. This is what bitcoins is: code, miners, hashing, exchanges, merchants, wallets, and consumers. At the code and miner level ( Bitcoin) is the foundation. Basically digital real estate! All layer above that should rent access to this foundation. This allows the vote or ownership to be retained at the community level and basically giving layers the right to fees but no rights to make changes.

I don’t like the idea of reading white papers. First and foremost you should understand bitcoin. This may take a few years. But after that you will understand and be able to vet other projects based on the bitcoin standard. Understand and study the history of money. This is important because all of these projects are trying to be money. Understand that bitcoin is not competing with altcoins. Bitcoin is competing with
gold and nation state fiat. Any project that says they are better than bitcoin is not something you should exchange your fiat for.

Miners are not going to be titans. They provide a service to the protocol. They are not the protocol. As the price goes up in fiat terms more miners will join. That's how it works. That's the incentive. The block subsidy is the incentive not fees. Fees were put in place to prevent spam. 
The power lies within the user. All businesses are service providers. They need to do things to attract users. If you don't like a service then leave and find another. 
Off chain incentives miners to compete with it. They don't have to be cheaper. But what we have today is non competitive. If you feel that attached to say you will support them remember this. Miners get a block subsidy.

You give them an incentive and a punishment to follow the rules. Nodes are the judges of if miners are following the rules. If a miner breaks the rules they get no reward. When a miner finds a block they have to wait 100 block cycles to get the reward. How do you keep the nodes honest. Have lots of them to agree on what the rules are. If a few want to change the rules that everyone is following then they get kicked off the network. Nodes can ban other nodes for lying.

I'm a user and reading all this just brings one thing to my mind. It's human nature. From my research though I align with core. It's logical to take progressive steps into the future while maintaining the original intent. What I mean by this is. 1: When you hard fork from my understanding you take the original and make two. Like doing a stock split. Problem is I see you can't collapse back after that. It was the same for the internet. And the solution or path they took was to build on top of a foundation. Learn from the past. So at this juncture all participants are subjects to the developers. 
2. The network ecosystem has grown to where blocks are full. So the next logical thing is how to keep the miners incentivized to support the chain. They discover the Btc so financially they have cost beyond what the developers have. But this issue with this is miners get replaced or get diluted as more miners add to the network. So there is tension from competitive reason. I believe once the developers build that foundation where miners can operate at a reasonable margin this will subside. For those miners who can't compete they either have to turn off. 
2. Network markets. This is the weakest link because it's based on a supply and demand for Btc. It's basically an attempt to place value for each one. But no one can quite say what is that value. You have several components to Bitcoin. The store of value. The transaction of value. The supply and demand of value. Each of which combined in my opinion makes Bitcoin very undervalued. If every one just collected a coin the price would shoot up till someone decided to sell. Currently those selling are miners. They pay those electricity bills and for newer efficient equipment. As their supply to mine coins gets less. They will have more incentive to create more supply for themselves. But the market is the check and balance for that. If the market wants to quell the profitability of the miners then they could just raise the price higher. But by doing so would create more competition. What really needs to happen in the future is to have a consolidated market feed. Like a best bid offer system globally. That way the differences between markets can narrow. Make the markets compete for your business. 
3. Traders those who only interact with the exchanges due to the above are getting the worst of it. They can't arbitrage prices from different locations. They create the best bid and offer. If the spread is not enough to make a profit after the fee then you lose. 
4. Merchants this is how it ties to the product world. They need price stability within a transaction period. They are the ones who need a layered topology. They are the ones who have to risk transacting with Btc for goods and services. When they could choose to use fiat. The price of one Btc changes so they are having to adjust to those conditions. And currently using on chain may be time consuming. If the price changes 1% in a confirmation period they are losing or gaining 1%. Then you have to account for regulations like taxes. They will be the generators of the fee. So till a solution is adopted for them w will have lots of uncertainty. And the fees for the future has to be enough to keep the network running (miners). At every halving you could expect the fees to more than double if the merchants are penetrating the product economy to its fullest. Like I said a solution layer or layers needs to evolve for them to do this. But first you need to let the developers hash this out. And once they are comfortable with the place of the main Blockchain they can turn the innovation over to the merchants. 
5. Consumers will have to do what they do. But for the ecosystem to be able to transact seemlessly as if they were using fiat. 
So in a nut shell we are still at the development stage. Mining will get more competitive as the markets prices each Btc higher. And the higher the better within reason. Merchants will look to get price stability within a transaction period to offer consumers a comparative to fiat. This is a shadow of the current fiat system. The money creator ie Fed does not interact with the merchants or consumers. They interact with the banks(miners). Banks interact with the merchants and consumers. The market can regulate the system and give banks merchants, and consumers a way to value Btc. 
So the reality is the developers still hold they keys. And till they get the main chain efficient for scaling then there is no debate. After the first layer is innovated for maximum efficiency everyone will have to be patient. Once the hand off happens we will go through another layer innovative cycle. So at this moment I feel the value of each Btc is undervalued by 10x to 30x. So the miners can fund not more mining capacity but merchant capacity. So the market as bad of a deal as it seems really needs to stop holding back progress

That's what you missed. The miners are at constant battle with the developers. In the end the merchants and users lose. At some point miners are gonna see that the Bitcoin economy is moving beyond the mining aspect. And the developers are trying to create a handoff to develop a merchant economy for end use. You don't really see this type of debate going on with etherum. Whatever the developers want they do. They are concentrating on the end use. While the Bitcoin miners are concentrating on maximum profit. That's why the scaling issue is hotly debated. The Bitcoin economy outgrew itself. That's a success in my opinion. The market has placed a $700 per Btc price but the issue is still how are you going to scale to allow more TPS. The miners understand the more competition and the halving will cut into how much they make. I don't know any long term holders who actually want a scaled up hard fork. Because once you go down that path as the solution you lose. What I mean is at $700 per Btc you hard fork to scale double then that reflects a $350 at the market. Even though though amount doesn't change. And then the miners may say do it again. All the while merchants and consumers are stuck out of the conversation. The miners want to increase the fees to generate more but don't understand the fees is a percentage of a transaction not a percentage of each Btc. So a higher price is not some of the incentive. It's about faster transactions and more Btc. What Bitcoin needs is not more miners. It needs more merchants to offer a transaction experience for the consumer. But if the market raises the price all you get is more miners. Instead of more merchant chains. Where I live you have 3 Bitcoin ATM for 5 million people. Miners are not focusing on the end user. If not they'd be partnering with gas stations, and burger joints. The same with the exchanges too. You have more Btc slushing in the markets vs what out in the economy. It reflects exactly the way fiat markets are. What I truthfully feel is to get miners out of the way. They market should just take 1 Btc to $1 million and the miners can create a merchant economy that we can use. Or even $10 million per coin. Build Btc gas stations and grocery stores and restaurants. Give businesses the incentive to transact in Btc. Give consumers a choice. But leave the total available Btc at 21 million. innovate

They do understand it enough to know. If demand for fiat becomes less. Then it could impair them from stabilizing economies in downturns. But the logic is in a vacuum. The crypto markets can react in a stimulative manner and do the same thing. So net net you have two parallel system that can boost economies when needed. 
The logic flaw in my thinking is that they may try to suppress bitcoin in a downturn to make it look as if it can’t play a role in boosting the economy. Which will mainly be them printing more and more.

I get what you are saying. But that is not what most of us want to do. Our purpose of hodling is not to sell to get more fiat. It’s to be able to use the network as intended as peer to peer cash. It may take you a few yrs to understand this. And the market makes it harder because the price is volatile. So if a govt steps in and tried to buy as much btc as possible then we in return will accelerate building out the networks for us to use.

Governments that choose to ban or over regulate it will fail. People will choose one way or another. That's the whole idea behind a decentralized monetary system. They are very hard to regulate. By the way the IMF has a one world currency for governments to interact. It's called special drawing rights (SDR) for short. The only thing different with Bitcoin by concept is membership and use of Bitcoin isn't restricted or controlled by a single entity. Nation state should have little concern really with Bitcoin. They all have the power to tax. That's where the power lies. Central banks are a powerful force in the world but things change. Politicians favor those central banks because they have the power to create money. So does Bitcoin. Once they realize that and some do it will be a game changer. Take a politician or regulator that sees central banking for the power destruction it causes and see there is now a choice. One way or the other they make the laws. There is already a split happening in that area. Politicians with no banking background favor Bitcoin. Politicians with a banking background don't. And as it always happens it takes 12 to 17 years for changes in the world to happen. That's the length of time for one generation to go through the education system. Remember that. All Bitcoin has to do is stay relevant for that period of time to remain a force. We are in year 8. You will see graphics with the adoption of the internet. That has taken 30 years. The last 10 are the most significant. And during this process governments have tried and tried to regulate it to the point they think they control it. It hasn't worked out. The World Wide Web was created in 1989. It didn't take off till 10 years later. So with or without governments the genie is out. It takes time and a generation to evolve. But once it happens there will be many Bill gates added to the list of the rich.

The fix makes economic sense. It is a real no brainer. BUT some mix the economic aspect with the financial aspect which caused this debate. Segwit not only allows for scaling but also growing the Blockchain. The other alternative just grows the Blockchain. As I keep saying because it's the truth adding 2,4,8 mb is not scaling. It's just bigger blocks. No matter what by true terms Core has it right. I'd take a little block growth to accommodate 1 million x more transactions. Each mb added to a block only adds 7-10 more tx per block. The only cost to the block to enable scaling is .7mb.

You just confirmed what all the other desperate crypto thought leaders say. Then post a quantum threat. Are you that stupid? Libra does not exist. There is no code. And there is a reason why Satoshi did what he did. At any given time the US, China, Japan, Germany, or any other major country can end crypto and Libra. When you cut the head off a snake the rest of the body dies. 
So why do we have crypto and non existent Libra. Because you can’t shutdown bitcoin. There is no one to throw in jail. No one. So your masters have decided to let the space become flooded to dilute Bitcoin. They know you better than you know yourself.

I think it's more about hedge funds and money managers looking to buy volume direct from the miner. That way they can set their own price without market forces pushing up the price. It doesn't work that way in the Bitcoin world. They have to use our markets. 
It is true. The wolves are circling looking for multiple 50k to 80k btc purchases from the miners. Or basically a years supply of btc. 657k of newly mined btc are up for sale and there is a buyer. Why is this below $5k still?

Here is the reason to be optimistic about bitcoin and not crypto. The ecosystem is still growing. Hash power is reaching new highs monthly. This is not hash power for crypto. It’s hash power for bitcoin. Who knows multi coin miners may run out of room to mine other coins because they are putting in more bitcoin miners. Next you have development for bitcoin. It’s still growing. New contributors are adding lines of code every week. The build out of LN is growing every week. At some point it’s growth will be 1000’s of users per week not just hundreds. No other project is progressing like this. Third the weakest aspect of bitcoin is the exchanges and the coin fanatics. They take away from what is going on. This is bullish because it keeps these distractors far away from bitcoin. 
This is not 2014. Even though the markets wants to play it that way. But maybe the market wants projects to be abandoned. Let them die from the pressure of not being able to scale. Bitcoin is very robust and is growing by all aspects. Those who think we must all succeed are the problems. And if it takes a few years for them to run out of cash then so be it. For them it’s the 2014 moment that they are experiencing. And in 2020 when they don’t bounce back its time for those to reflect on what crypto is. It’s just Bitcoin. Looking forward and bullish on these projects fading.

I had this thought that when bitcoin does hit $3-$4T in value we just air drop with a system to use in areas like Venezuela or Zimbabwe. Drop like $50B worth and really hyperbitcoinize the country. That is a drop in the bucket on $4T in value. 
The more value bitcoin has the easier it is to do that without sacrificing a large supply of coins

OP is a fool. But that’s part of the learning lesson. If you buy what you can afford to lose. And you are only down 35% that is far better than losing it all. OP needs to see that as a positive. I do. I find it funny how ppl can buy $100 in lotto tickets and never win but never be distraught about it. But when the buy $100 in btc to find out months later it’s worth $65 it’s the end of the world and then the excuses come out. 
My advice to this person is to stay the course because the mission of buying what you can afford to lose means just that. It means you are ok with losing it all. It’s surprising that OP still has some sats. Also OP invest in stocks and gives an apples to oranges comparison. If I’m down 35% on $100 in btc but up 15% on a $1000 worth of stocks then net net I’m up $115. If someone thinks everything they invest in will go up that’s not reality. And part of being diversified like this is seeing the forest between the trees. 
As a long term investor, saver, hoarder my advice to OP would be stay the course and don’t fall for short term thinking or speculation. Don’t be afraid to cut your losses. And never be afraid to see 1 out of many of your ships sink. I have personally lost every single penny I’ve put into 1 stock but I’ve made more on others to keep my whole balance going up. And this is how you learn.  But in my personal opinion I’d take this 35% down and DCA in what I can afford to lose to break even. And if that happens keep on keeping on.

Demand does pay a part in what the fiat equivalent is. But so does the market price. That's what I'm trying to convey. You can't just target block size as the issue. And that is how the dynamics of market based ecosystems work. Which means complaining or debating the fees is determined by other factors than block size. If we do get bigger blocks that leads to more transactions the price of btc will go up. That means fees will go up. So if miners want fees to be lower they can just charge less. That's what they can control independently. I see this all the time in oil markets. When the price is high oil companies produce a lot more. But once the storage tanks fill up the markets drop the price. Then the oil companies complain because they can't make enough money to produce at the same levels. They even try to persuade the market on what price they want. No one wants to cut. So the market takes the price lower to pressure some action to take. In the end they cut or freeze and let demand catch up to reduce storage levels and balance supply and demand. Bitcoin dynamics is no different. 
And forgive me for the categorizing. It's just associating the two factions. I know Core wants bigger blocks too. Just the approach to getting there is technically different. Segwit increases the block size. Going from 1MB to 2.1MB means the block got bigger. It just makes sense that miners act exactly like oil producers. And markets have not truthfully played its part in the debate. That's because it's an immature market. Over time they will figure it out. The same with users on the fee market. Users can control what they pay. As long as they don't make time for confirmation an issue. And yes I wait a long time for confirmations because the market lets me set what I'm willing to pay for fees. I'm not buying coffee.

Why not just use a payment channel. Each company can have a wallet on a channel. Big companies can create their own payment channel so when you goto Walmart they don't have to worry about the middleman. They are the middleman. Then the payment channel can confirm multiple transactions as one on the block chain. Some companies may not have the expertise to design a payment channel so they can contract with a payment channel provider for a fee. This way you don't have to have a visa or MasterCard symbol at the consumer level. Just need a wallet.

So saying that downgrades the countries economy. India has a upper middle class the size of America. They make $$$$ just like us in the developed world. So yes India does have a need. Plus with the capacity of cheaper labor they can create miners at a lower cost. But electricity is higher there. What the Bitcoin world needs to do is be patient. It will evolve. Etherum may be a more out of the box equivalent to fiat but it will act as a transfer mechanism. The one thing you have to remember is deflationary vs inflationary. At some point constant inflation will drive the price of each ETH down. The more people use it the lower the price goes. That's how economics works. It will get stronger vs the dollar. Bitcoin will not because it has a limit. So once it peaks in supply vs supply of what's mined it will reach a deflationary cycle. It will take years not weeks or months. Inflation helps the top of the financial chain. That's why we have more and more billionaires each year. That's why the rich continue to get richer. They only want an inflationary system while controlling the flow of funds through the system. That's the reason why Bitcoin will survive. It works against the inflationary system. Which means a poor person can take whatever savings they can and wait for that to be worth more or increase their purchasing power. That's why the global economist and elite see it as a threat.

Institutional investors really need a few things. Yet the SEC is not giving them what they want. I don’t think they even care about how much it cost to mine as a starting point either. If they have $2T to invest over the next 10 years into bitcoin even at today’s prices that is an easy 10X. If the multiplier is added even a 30X in just 10 years. Which is far greater than 2X in 10 years or barely beating inflation. 
From my understanding, they want an established institutions to deal with. They want clarity and protections against the rampart fraud that crowds this space from miners to exchanges. And the reality of the matter is it has nothing to do with bitcoin. It has everything to do with the exchanges and other projects. It’s the ICO’s that have them concerned. They can’t invest without knowing if they are in the process of becoming securities. And none of the exchanges are qualified to allow securities to be traded under US laws. And those exchanges all have bitcoin listed too. So why take the risk right now till that can be resolved. There is no reason to put retirement accounts in jeopardy that will own btc because an exchange is allowing securities to be traded without a license to do so. And the projects that know they are securities are not doing anything to properly file under US securities laws. 
Coinbase is trying even though many hate them. They will start a bulletin board for tokens like regular pink sheet stocks. I think the best approach for the SEC is to offer a non punitive grace period for these projects to file and a temporary halt in US markets till that is done for projects that participate. Give them 2 years to come into compliance. Give them 30 days to register before trading can resume. But no fines. And if a project has no network and is just developing software they are not eligible for this offer. If a project has not been up and running for a minimum of 2 years they are ineligible too. But it has to be clear then institutions will come into this market.

It's not complex to whomever wrote it. The most limited resource on the Blockchain is the size of the block. It is not a miner resource. It's a node resource. Blocksize should be heavily weighted to nodes economic interest as priority. Some nodes have no mining interest.

Being faster doesn’t make it better or more superior. Libra is going to be a basket of fiat. Which means it is built on top of a fragile system. The same system that is causing the issues today. Libra enables those who use this fragile system to make them richer at the detriment to others. The end result for Libra is to do what fiat did to gold. Offer more convenience. When it becomes widely held guess what. There is no need for it to be using a basket of fiat to make you feel like it’s legitimate. Basically replacing all the central banks and the elected officials that oversee these currencies. And it puts the value transfer mechanism into a smaller group of men. This includes Zuck. Which leads to him and his legacy with the ability to control every aspect of your life regardless of what your elected leaders say. And there is nothing you can do. This is the reality. The trick of it is is to get you and billions others to think it provides a better quality than what fiat has to offer in exchange for its use.

Deciding on whether it’s a security is based on the Howey test. Which as for EOS who raised capital thru an ERC20 token. The ERC20 token is deemed as a security. But wen tokens were done thru the main net those aren’t. But ETH didn’t use an ERC. They raised directly. Which means at form it was a security. Even though you could argue after the fork ETH tokens aren’t securities but the initial ETC tokens are. 
But to the genesis block. Coins created before the genesis block thru a capital raise are securities. The situation is tough because there is no standardization of how it’s done. Fundamentally mined coins aren’t securities.

Yes I do find it very hard for anyone even remotely thinking ETH is something g it is not. I’m not talking about what they say it will do. But what it does and has been proven. No it has not proven to have a single smart contract that works. It is not a world computer at 25 tps. It is not anything but a crowd funder. Which most ERC-20 tokens accept btc too. All you need is a wallet address. What about the latest critical bug in parity. What about the pre mine that is still largely in the hands of a few. At what point is ETH going to execute something other than a hardfork. Here is the biggest sign I see as a failure. The transition to POS. This admits that ETH can’t scale on chain or off chain. This is a fact. All that I said is facts. 99% of you are only hodling it for the price to go up. Which means no one will really use it. And then yes many suspect the pump in alts from ETH crowdfunding was the direct result of a mixer on chain. What are they trying to hide? It’s called pump your ICO to make it appear like it has value. Software has no value if no one uses it. And people use bitcoin. Look at localbitcoins as an example. Oh wait a bank in Argentina just used btc to transfer payments cross border. So till anything useful gets used on ETH or ETH scales it’s just a crowd funding protocol. An expensive one at that.

I will use rhetoric to explain this. When you hodl BTC you are not earning. You are saving. Another aspect is if you have to keep an eye on it. Then you put in more than you are willing to risk. How often does a person look at their pension amount. Or their 401K amount. Not very often. And until you get comfortable with hodling btc it’s best to learn more about what the protocol has to offer. Even find friends and family who can research with you. Because it takes a team just to understand what is really going on. 
You can get a greater network effect to value by 100 million ppl all putting in $100 a month as saving vs trying to hit it big with a large one time exchange. And the market will become less volitile because savers will always have a floor set.

Ten yrs ago it didn’t even have a price. So 40X in 5 yrs doesn’t compare to the 9000X it’s done in 10 yrs. It does sound like a lot but bitcoin has a large multiplier. For every $ put in it generates $15-$20 in increased purchasing power over a 4 yr period. I might also add that this doesn’t apply to all coins either. So be advised if you hold s basket of them that the likely hood of them repeating what bitcoin is doing is slim to none. The race is not based on % gains either. The race is becoming as I say the first to $1 million per coin. At that point bitcoin will be an emerging currency. At that point all hodlers will need to use this increased purchasing power to contribute to society as you see fit. Hopefully for good. It will be our responsibility to make bitcoin widely held for the masses.

You know what makes a money better than the other. It’s not fast transactions. It’s not being the cheapest fee. Even though btc on LN is the cheapest fee. It’s not the lowest unit value.

I’ll answer it. It called the law of supply and demand. FOMO always leads to demand destruction. It’s an imbalance between what new money and existing money can maintain. Plus miners were able to lock in high margin coins. So when the first sign sell off came through they sold off with it. And lower prices lead to more selling. And more selling lead to lower prices. Another aspect is more miners have joined. This creates even lower margins for miners. So they have to sell more if not almost all they mine to pay for electricity. The new miners are more efficient but they squeeze the old miners. So what we have today is a market somewhat at equilibrium. This will continue till you get more new money to sustain higher prices. And higher prices means miners don’t have to sell everything they mine to pay bills. But they may sell to buy newer more efficient miners. All of this is economics at its finest. A true market like oil. It’s not manipulation like a central bank buying ETF’s and bonds to prop up prices.

80 bps fee with $5 cap. That's how you monetize Bitcoin. That's how you stay in business. It open and transparent. It's very competitive compared to all solutions. And as per their website Visa style payments are 2.9% plus .30. 
That's a merchant and consumer solution with no hassles. That's how you scale Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 02:13:44
Bitcoiners are not being picky over who gets confirmed first. It's called surge pricing. And when the surge dies off then fees will be lower. It may take longer for a fee pay below the surge price mechanism but it will get confirmed. I bought BTC during a surge and used the lowest fee. It took days but I didn't need to use the Btc immediately. If your complaint is based on an economic or financial condition aka broke people remember Bitcoin itself has natural deflation and minimal inflation. So the broke people's purchasing power increases over time.

But that's at the expense of the nodes. They have no financial incentives. The idea is to have future capacity I understand that. But also being able to use off chain transactions too. Consumers and merchants benefit from that. Fees are fees and the real competition charges 800% more than Bitcoin. So there is wiggle room. Lowest cost doesn't mean free. Even with the fee market it's practically free. The biggest cost is time. But there is billions of payments that aren't time sensitive. Paying utilities. Phone bills and car notes. Stuff like that. It would be great to mix all cases and propose as a community and not as a political block. Come together and have an update plan like every 2 years. Apple and Samsung do it why not Bitcoin. Find a way to do it without a HF. No matter what you say it creates uncertainty. Investors and traders perception means no unity within the protocol. Fight all you want but stay together. If core proposes something sit at the table and counteract with code not words. When code is released there should be a consensus not waiting a year to say ok. That's not ok. Create channels where developers can talk amongst themselves. Rotate being lead development team per update. Each tackle a problem then come together and make it one. Letting one team do it all doesn't work. Take the mining hat off and make decisions as developers. This is what the market wants to see. The bad news bears coming together to win games. Not bashing each other. Do that and funds will come in. Wall Street knows it's not Blockchain it's Bitcoin. Growing pains suck. And leave the egos to private discussions not in public.

That’s only because you want it too. This is the reality. ETH a pre mine aka ICO took in bitcoins and used the pre mine to fund development of other ICO’s. This was made by a centralized team. Maybe you haven’t been around long enough to hear everything ETH has said it was going to be. The only thing it has done is to be a crowd fund raising platform. Most of which they funded. The proof is none of these projects are dumping because ETH investors from the pre mine have influence over them. So your empty words to say everything that applies to ETH applies to bitcoin. That is clearly not true. You know why ETH has 250k developers. Because the ETH foundation funds them. And once they are ready to tokenize the ETH foundation gets their ETH back. The Bitcoin foundation has no deal with Bitcoin. No one even listens to what they say or offer. Most of them on that board are part of the ICO for everyone crowd.

A company called Blue gas in West Texas is doing the exact thing. Layer1 is getting a lot of press but this midstream company will have the lowest rate in the US. Due to the dynamics of what is happening in West Texas and the nat gas glut. The company is buying more high power generators to power just bitcoin miners. At 0.025/kWh is going to be hard to beat. The engines have a 15 yr normal life span with extended life of 10 yrs after overhaul. 
It’s going to get very competitive in the US over the next few yrs. We have just so much extra capacity for electricity is just a boom waiting to happen. The same in Canada and Mexico too.

So just because bitcoin is transparent we can just apply different standards. Really how much does it cost to type in 5 billion units then sell them on the exchanges. I’ll be conservative becaus exchanges make projects pay to list. $50 million. That means a project like Tron should be close to $50 million in network value right. 
Can we just admit you have a different standard for bitcoin than you have for everything else. And if we translate this to something like a growth stock don’t you think it should trade at multiples of cost to produce the coins. That’s why I call your talk BS. What you really want to emphasize is since bitcoin is digital gold than it should be valued just like gold. Close to its cost to produce. And gold is not a network. Besides the fact that nation states, central banks, and banks own most of it. 
I find it very unreasonable to think this way and I’ve been in this since 2012. And in 2014 which was probably the best year in terms of hodlers to accumulate. But shall we digress to say you have no clue about how to value bitcoin. It’s a network. It’s a commodity, it’s it’s own economic system. I will admit too that I don’t know how to completely value bitcoin but I do know the cost of decentralization is above the marginal cost to produce coins. At the marginal cost you will get some centralization. That’s how we wound up with a cartel and a dictator like Jihan and Bitmain. Is that what investors want. Bitcoin is not worth it if someone rules it. And decentralization is a higher cost to pay for but it’s worth it.

It’s pretty clear to anyone who has been paying attention that btc is not a security. It gives many altcoiners hope. But the SEC has also made it clear that all ICO’s are securities. Those are the altcoins like ETH. But the SEC does not want to put any names out to the public. This interview did confirm something though. The SEC is NOT going to change or make exceptions to how they classify what is a security. And I’ll tell you, being decentralized has nothing to do with it. By the way the altcoins trading on US exchanges can be halted at anytime at the discretion of the SEC.

You aren’t missing anything. There is no such thing as legal consensus. You have the law. But there are somethings that would cost more to enforce. Bitcoin causes no harm. 
But the US government has been more supportive than most would like to think. And the Fed doesn’t have the power to ban bitcoin. It’s not in their mandate nor falls under them for monitoring. As I have heard J Powell the president of the Fed likes the idea of private money. He also, likes the idea of having more privacy when it comes to transactions. The only real hate has come from Wahl Street and a few big banks. So let’s not play on fears that are unsubstantiated. 
Buy what you can afford to lose. Learn to hodl and understand were all not great traders. Just saving little by little over time does more good than bad. And it’s not as stressful. Learn about money.

Here is my take. 
1. LN is not an exclusive network. It can be many LN nodes. (Millions). Each merchant can offer this payment solution to customers at 0 cost of low cost. It's a software node. 
2. It's a two party channel. But as a merchant I don't have to put btc in it. My goods will be for exchange. The consumer will. But once I close the channel probably daily I'll update my balance on the main chain. That's where I'll pay a fee to the miners. It will be a settlement system. The user will do the same. It's about the frequency of settlement. Also it gives merchants the ability to process many tx at once. 
3. How does this effect the miners? Not much. It allows for further expansion and adoption. The cost for LN is 0. It's software. Just like using cash. It's fast and convenient. The Blockchain will act as a settlement layer. But as a merchant when I have to pay my suppliers it will be on the Blockchain. Why? Because time is not an issue. So now the Blockchain is a payment layer. But the tx values will be big. No more coffee tx on the Blockchain. 
4. The potential for payment fees and settlement fees is tremendous. Merchants already have established customers. And if they can get away with 0 fee for each customer tx. It's a win win. Remember Visa charges 3% + 0.30 per tx. So if a daily balance to settle is $50k and 6500 tx that's adds up. With LN they only have to pay for the settlement on the Blockchain. I'll discuss that next. But that reduces slippage and friction. It leaves the merchant with more $$$$$ for providing the same experience. 
5. Fee generation will need to change the formula. Instead of charging Satoshi per kb. Charge Satoshi per input tx value. You can still have a fee market but the upper limit will be capped. It's reasonable to be at .25% at most. So if a 1MB block holds 2000 tx and the inputs from settlement and payment channels are 3000 btc then the block will produce a fee of max 75btc. That's more than the block reward. But it's reasonable for the average to be 15-28btc at mature adoption rates. 
6. Now for misconception.  Why would I as a merchant keep a channel open for more than a day as a retailer. I won't. I'll give the customer a receipt. If they want to return something they need a receipt and the merchandise. If it's a food store I don't take returns on open products. I don't have to worry about chargebacks on the customer end either. 
7. Not all merchants need LN. Just high volume ones. I get my oil changed there is no need for it. I pay my mortgage there is no need for it. I pay my light bill there is no need for it. See what I mean. 
8. For the US region there could be 2-3 million LN channels. China the same. EU the same. But each region can represent total 1-2 billion consumers and merchants. LN removes friction and saves a lot without bloating the Blockchain in the process. If taylored correctly many will not know they are using it. And that's the purpose. But having to think of when my tx will confirm on the Blockchain is going to be a thing of the past with LN and other sidechains.

Every 4 years the supply of coins created halve. Currently we get 12.5 btc every 10 min. In 2020 that number will be 6.25. In 2024 it will be half of that. Also to note by 2020 18 million btc will have been created. The other 3 million will take 120 years to produce. This is not like gold.

Bitcoin centralization is at the mining level. But mining is not in charge. Users are. We proved that last August. And if they try again we will do it again. So there is very little concern on that front. Also, we have several new ASIC manufacturers who are reeling to dethrone Bitmain. And that will happen too. Innovation leads not personalities. And last LN does work. I’ve used it myself several times as for testing. I can easily do 100 tps to and from myself in a channel at almost 0 cost. I really don’t think you know what you are talking about when it comes to the development level. And even only being less than 6 months old LN has far more wallets than nano. And many more will be developed. That’s the difference. Developers want to buidl on the premier chain. And it’s not nano.

That’s the question that the SEC avoids to say in an official capacity. Why do they not want to be a security? Google is a security. Facebook is a security. They’ve made lots of money too. Why do projects go out of their way to not wanting to be securities? Answer: because you can’t use securities as money or a currency. No matter what the tech is. They want to be money. It’s a fallback in case the tech fails. We have 187 nation state currencies in the world. So you actually think crypto is making life better with 2500 of them.

Social constructs fall along the same lines as traditions in cultures. They don’t actually become adopted. They become a fabric in our values and morals. It takes time.  Even though bitcoin has an incentive system for you to participate. Until it can break the construct of what people believe to be money then it will be so. If you ever hear about full faith and credit in the USD. That had only been around since the 70’s. The US gov had to instill a construct into the people to believe USD had any value. They called it backing by the word of the government. It was before redeemable for gold or silver. So it was fitting to call it that. But nothing backs gold or silver. Yet you won’t see anyone carrying a bag of gold to buy a car. That is because golds construct as money has diminished. It now is only a store of value. 
Social constructs of money tend to change as the technology as a medium of exchange change. Metal became paper. Paper is becoming digital. Bitcoin mixes a digital means of exchange with a physical trait of paper or gold. And regardless of which coin ppl think is to replace bitcoin none of them possess what bitcoin offers. The exact same characteristics of gold. No one controls gold. It’s in the ground. But they all stress the tech. Which is important but not the one thing that makes it important or valuable.

You are taking this the wrong way. When he says core he means all developers not just blockstream. What he is saying is what his customers are telling him. To us it's not about f......g mining. Merchants and consumers make Bitcoin. We are the end users. Bitcoin Blockchain has turned itself into central banking. 1MB, 2MB, 20MB is the same as should we raise rates today or next year. Their process is the same as yours. A consensus is needed. OB wants a side channel, Airlines want a side channel, movie studios want a side channel, even Walmart will do it because it saves them millions in tx cost. Each side channel will create a decentralized network. It won't be just one big LN network. Corporations would never let there revenue be dictated by open source software. So the sooner that is enabled the sooner tx volume will go parabolic. Which means Bitcoin price will go parabolic. That's scaling. Using established companies that have customers.

There are no downsides to Segwit. It creates 300% more in TPS. But included is the malleability fix. This allows features for sidechains and layers on top of the Blockchain. Miners get a subsidy to secure the Blockchain. It's not the whole ecosystems responsibility to ensure they make massive amounts of profits on top of that. Let the creativity and innovation expand on top of the Blockchain. Visa can have a sidechain. PayPal can have a sidechain. Western union can have a side chain. All side chains add value to the Blockchain. Lightening and many others will allow consumers and small to midsize merchants to transact in a timely manner. 
I've said many times, voting for segwit is voting for scaling and GROWTH. It's not about mining anymore. If the miners in there respective countries want. They too can create a sidechain. Nothing is stopping them. But time is running out till the next halving. Stalling or halting growth will hurt them in the long run.

What you have to understand about mining especially POW mining. POW is an old concept. That is why Satoshi chose that over any other form. Wouldn’t it be great if you could just mix a few chemicals and make oil or gold. That would surely drive down the cost to manufacture. So a bitcoin miner just like an oil or gold miner has to use some energy to produce the product. In this digital age most have a hard time understanding that. You cannot fake energy use. 
The other aspect of bitcoin and other POW coins is the coin creation schedule. It too is just like gold and oil. As time goes by it gets harder and harder to produce. And bitcoin with its difficulty adjustment accomplishes this. But with a twist. When the market price of oil or gold is high you have a supply response. Which means the miners will produce more. Which usually leads to a supply and demand imbalance. This lowers the price to the point it becomes produced at the margin. With bitcoin there is no supply response. You only get more miners which raises the difficulty. It also means older less efficient miners will eventually produce at a loss. And since 2009 the hashrate of bitcoin has only gone up. 
Now for energy usage. Cheap electricity does play a factor. But location does too. Cold regions fare better because cooling does not need to be added to the facility. Renewables like hydroelectric is under utilized globally. Many locations have a surplus. Natural gas is also abundant. Waste nat gas is abundant too. And nat gas is the primary fuel for electricity. Nuclear energy and hydrothermal energy has surpluses also. Add in solar and wind and the world has a large capacity. By the way, Bitcoin uses 20% of the amount of energy that it takes for gold. So all of these concerns about energy are unfounded. It is just the media spreading an agenda to influence the masses of how mining bitcoin is wasting energy. And most of you believe it by the discussions.

Many need to stop thinking they are going to make x USD. It’s all about how many bitcoins or satoshi’s you get. If they inflate fiat then buy more btc.

None of that is the case. And it’s not altruism. Basically you flood a market and the population takes over using it. The US has done that on many occasions when they air drop USD. Lots of nations especially in S. America use USD as a parallel currency. The cure for hyperinflation or bouts of long durations of inflation is a separate means of storing value and a medium of exchange.

Because all blockchain have a record. Bitcoins genesis block has 50 btc. Which is not spendable. But if you look at ETH you will see the genesis block is created then shortly after a record of all coins issued prior to launch. All pre mines have this. You can never erase them or you mess up the amount of coins generated at the tip of the chain.

But what is Bitcoin's true value. Only in China are people trading it. The rest of the world is soaking up supply from exchanges. The people buying btc are not buying just one. They are buying multiples. People are getting paid in btc. Stores are adding it as a payment option. Retirement funds are allowing it as an option. Hedge funds and money managers are buying in too. People all over the world are using Bitcoin in some way or fashion. Not on a large scale but enough to cause price pressure. It's not unimaginable for transaction volume and other use cases to grow 60%+ year over year for the next decade. It has a limited supply. Retail holders can still afford to buy 1. The western world doesn't understand this ain't about millenials buying only. I'm selling 40 btc a week and the average age I get is above 40. I don't know what's causing people to buy but they are still buying. And it's not gold. You can buy coffee with it.

It will depend on the receiver. If they take LN payments then that is what you will use. If they don’t then use the mainchain. Those who are hating on LN are the same types that hated on bitcoin in 2012 to 2015. Some are from competing coins. VC’s have flooded the market with many different types of solutions that don’t work or can’t scale. LN will grow organically just like the mainchain has. Give it time.

Every year 2% of you USD value gets confiscated. It’s called inflation. When ever you hear your self saying things just cost more. Guess what the value of USD was confiscated. That people care about. Especially if they work and don’t get a pay raise that keeps up with inflation. 
Next, wallets that are not secure are typically multicoin wallets. And ppl get phished with regular bank accounts too. Scammers are always going to scam. 
Inflation is the government stealing from its citizens. It allows them to have massive debt while destroying the purchasing power. 
All of this that you have stated is typical. You just don’t know how fiat and nation state money works. That is ok. But you can buy bitcoin. It’s a choice you can make. No one is forcing you. And all the concerns of those who don’t understand money are free to opt out. But it never hurts to put what ever you can afford to lose and buy some. Then forget about it.

The market does need to move beyond bitcoin. This is a true statement. Bitcoin itself is causing a false sense of value across many projects in the space. That’s what this article reveals. Those that believe if only my shitcoin could be valued on its own merit, then it could possibly be seen as more valuable than bitcoin. What kind of delusional thoughts are these. If these projects were valued on their own merits most would be still close to zero. They don’t have anything to call of merit. Just coins and tokens trading on hype and confirmation bias. There aren’t many that have an economic impact beyond an exchange. Basically saying not many are using btc. But no one is using the others at all. ETH itself is just developers building on top of a slow database. So it appears that there is development but none of them are building out the infrastructure for the base chain. Until then there is no scale.

Users and merchants are the ones getting screwd. But this is really s good thing. Big blockers want more capacity per block because they get paid per kb. Core wants to minimize block size by using payment channels to consolidate transactions into more Btc per block. Then move to a block weight type fee system. It's more efficient and requires less drive space for the future. But both solutions are great. But we need to move on from this just being about mining. What we need is a billion consumers and businesses with wallets putting the system to the test. But we can't because it has to be either or. Fuck them.

Libra will never replace USD. It’s built on top of a fragile system. The approach maybe akin to how gold was replaced by USD. But at that time the alternative to USD was not available. And Libra is not an alternative. It’s an extension. On this sub be careful because we are for decentralized, open source, permissionless money. We are for Proof of work. And the creation of bitcoin is 10X better than fiat or a basket of fiat. It’s you who can’t tell the difference to what bitcoin is and what fiat and Libra are. Money is not an app. It’s 50% of all transactions. And yes associating Bitcoin as with China as you have is propaganda. Bitcoin is the first GLOBAL currency for the world.

Yes it is good for jewelry. But for today the main use is putting it in vaults. Also when it comes to intrinsic value there is no such thing. It’s made up. Nothing in this world has it. And that was the topic. What is the intrinsic value of bitcoin. It’s the same as gold or copper or fruit.

Your argument doesn’t account for a globalized money.  And next you have to account for being a protocol. Like the internet. How many users are on the internet. The coin value as long as you financial types stop making this about assets can be just on par with other currencies and units of accounts. That easily puts bitcoin in the multiple trillions of USD. We have to reach a point where ppl will prefer to spend and use bitcoin. That’s when the normalized returns will come into play. And those returns will be a measurement of growth and inflation. Till then it’s all about getting as many ppl to own bitcoin as possible. Then once that happens fiat can operate in parallel till bitcoin assumes the unit of account. $4-6M a coin is possible. 
As for altcoins the effect will be different. Most are centralized with a high concentration in the hands of a few. That is the most important issue. Most ppl are looking at well bitcoin is worth this much so XRP can be worth the same. Yet they have 4X to 1000X more coins. Then you have POS coins. Which is the exact same thing as central banking.

You can say the same thing for cash. But your reasons for bitcoin are not the reason bitcoin was created. Bitcoin was created as a way for you to pay me without the need for a trusted third party. It’s design is specific to its intent. The fixed amount is to counter the unlimited amount of fiat. The ability for you to run the code and validate the amount is to make sure that no one can create extra bitcoin without you coming or saying you agree to that. 
It’s not just payments. It’s an alternative monetary system. If you think you know about money then you wouldn’t be talking about just payments. Bitcoiners show many things about the current system and past ones. Take for example since 1971 when we left Breton Woods. The top 1% has benefitted at the expense of the rest. Or if you have heard about “trickle down”. You know if the rich make money that money will trickle down to you. In economics that’s called cantillion effect. What that means or is. The rich will get richer because they get the new money first before it gets affected by inflation. And the amount of the inflation is the amount the rich gain at your expense. 
Lord Rothbard said and it still holds true. Give me control of the money and I care not who the ppl elect nor what rules they make. So the ppl who make the money today do you really think they care about you or who you elect. Better yet they can break all the rules and never be punished for it. Because they control the money. With bitcoin it’s been proven that no one controls it. No one controls the money. That’s powerful. It affects about everything in your life. Even though in the past and into the future there will always be someone or group who will try to control bitcoin. But it’s design is as such that makes it impossible. 
So what you have today are millions of ppl who are explains to their family, friends and acquaintances about something they have no clue about. It’s not about payments. Why do Bitcoiners or those on the monetary side take the time to explain this over and over. Because it’s that important. This will have a far greater impact than the printing press or the internet. And the system will get built so you can buy coffee with it. But as I say the impact of that is far greater than you can imagine. 
How long is this going to take. This is not a website like Facebook or Reddit. This is not an iPhone. It took the world 500 yrs to accept the concept of 0. It took the world 40 yrs to adopt the internet. It took the world 50 yrs to adopt the automobile. So please don’t think it’s going to take the world 3-5 yrs to adopt bitcoin. It’s going to take decades. We have only had 1. But the benefit to those today are you get the new money first. And in the future those who adopt bitcoin won’t see their purchasing power eroded because once inflation stops the cantillion effect stops. Having some may change your life and your future legacy lives. And still no one has control.

Because there is no such thing as intrinsic value. They made that up a long time ago. A lot of narratives have been made up to support an agenda. Some stick some don’t. There is no intrinsic value to gold. Gold can be made into things but do can lots of other metals. Bitcoin is digital so it can’t compare. But when used as a monetary instrument bitcoin is far greater than gold. Try sending 5 oz of gold thru the internet. The world we live in is digital. And if only on the local level you still need to verify your gold isn’t tungsten filled. Bitcoin doesn’t have this issue.

You are in this for the wrong reason. Bitcoin is traded like a commodity or a stock. But the reason for it to exist is not to make more fiat. It’s here to increase your purchasing power. So one day 1 btc can buy you are car or a house. But you won’t need to sell it for fiat then buy a car with it. That’s what the network is for. So I can pass 1 btc to you with out needing a trusted third party or a bank.

Banks don’t have any power on the poor. What bitcoin does enable is the potential to have steady purchasing power. If the currency you use maintains its purchasing power over periods of time the diminishing effects of inflation are null. The USD has what most will consider as moderate inflation but the effect of inflation is not born the same for everyone. Those who depend on wages are greatly affected by it. Those who augment cost of living with credit are greatly affected. Those who are asset heavy benefit greatly. It’s been greatly misleading that central banks have promoted the “wealth effect” as a policy. This has caused income inequality to widen. Actually just having fiat is causing income inequality. 
Under the gold standard the top 1% for decades captured just 6-8% of GDP. Under fiat this has grown to 18-22% of GDP. The middle income earners used to capture 48-51% of GDP. Now that number is almost 42%. What does that represent. It represent $1.2T in today’s USD that flows from the middle to the top 1%. This is the gap. It’s structural in nature. And no one wants to deal with it because it’s basically designed that way. It sounds good to trickle down but it never will happen.  There is no incentive to do that. 
What is the difference pre 1971 and post 1971. Gold. Gold placed a limit at the creation of credit. It also made it very expensive to hold credit or debt. The debt just could not be inflated away. Now we have bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is currently under the phase of finding a price for use in commerce. A point where it will provide stability. It will be a rocky road till we get there but there is an incentive to buy and hold it. The increasing of your purchasing power is compounded by its growing network effect. It’s not a transfer of wealth that is happening. It’s truly the creation of new wealth. The multiple is very high. Over time this multiple will decrease and that’s when it will provide the best effects for all ppl. 
It will not allow the 1% to create credit at a lower cost while also decreasing the purchasing power of everyone else. When they take on more debt to build things this will create more demand for btc. Which in turn will increase its price. Hence everyone will benefit from it. This is the opposite of fiat. When the 1% take on more debt it creates more currency which makes things cost more. When more houses are built ppl take out loans and it’s the same thing. Fiat has no limits to its effect of diluting previous USD. 
This is why I will always recommend ppl buy what they can afford without the need to sell in case of an emergency. It may only be $5 a week. But that is better than nothing. And if we can get 300 million to a billion ppl all doing the same it will be a better day. Stop chasing gains. Stop fooling yourself that you are going to hodl forever. Get your friends and your family to save little by little. If we all get rich then whose gonna make our food. I myself don’t mind working. 
Sorry for the length but my message to the world. Bitcoin is not going to save you unless you start getting bitcoin. And when the point happens everyone will benefit in the end. Central banks will still exist. Governments will still exist. Corporations will still exist. But they will no longer be able to reduce your purchasing power by creating more wealth for themselves.

Usually the gov has to give some incentive to the ppl in order to collect taxes. This is why they are having such a hard time collecting any taxes with bitcoin and crypto. 
If the gov want to collect more taxes on your house. They will appraise the value of your house higher. You gain more wealth. They collect more in taxes. As for companies dealing with Bitcoin and crypto they will be more tolerant on them as long as they report what you have bought and sold. The IRS knows if left to the individual the rate of reporting will be low. 
Another issue the IRS has to deal with is, on the currency front. Would they have to select which ones are currency like to get the foreign currency treatment. If not that opens the floodgates to every company and SV developer to create a token and say it’s a currency. That’s moral hazard. Mainly because the only use of 99% are speculation. But if they go about saying which projects are getting currency like treatment that could be a sign of picking winners and losers. What would be the parameters. And most of the parameters can be gamed. 
The best thing to happen is for the market to sort this out. It’s our job to pick the winners and losers. Most of you have never been in this situation and are carelessly keeping most of them afloat by trading and holding them. And this is playing into the benefit of the IRS. Why? Because their job is to collect taxes. So the more things to tax the better. 
If the market minimized the amount of projects and forced projects to build on top of the most well known ones then this issue with taxes could easily be resolved. The world gets no benefit from this tech by having a coin or token for each usecase. You can build s smart contract platform on top of bitcoin. You can build a dApp platform on top of bitcoin. Stablecoins, privacy coins, Defi, Ponzi schemes can all be built on top of bitcoin. 
So while you point the finger at the IRS please look at the big picture. Be patient and don’t get your hopes up. It’s a mess and if you really want adoption to happen then most if not 99% have to become worthless. Sorry to put it this way but there will be no legitimacy till the market makes a sign to fit into the structure vs trying to change it to suit there needs. 
Side note: This has been discussed for years and anything that it POW and not premine for ICO’d will likely be seen as a currency. And no this does not include ETC or ETH.

Lolli and Pei are good things for bitcoin. Imagine shopping and getting cashback. It’s something you can understand. Now imagine shopping and getting sats back. 
What these apps do is remove the mentality of what is the price of bitcoin. You get sats back no matter what the price is on things you buy. What sounds more reasonable to you. Buying $10 worth of btc or getting $10 worth of btc after shopping. Or spending $10 worth of btc to get a 30% discount. 
I use these apps and after 3 months I’ve gotten back over $250 in sats. I didn’t have to bear the mental cost of what the price of bitcoin is or didn’t I have to cutback on buying things to put USD into an exchange. They offer friends bonuses and add ins too.

Fill out endless forms and have multiple identity checks. It’s all a stall to keep you from getting possession of your gold. After being frustrated for months you give up.

Look POW is not something new at all. When we dig for oil we are using POW. Even baby making is POW. It’s not a matter of having advantages. It’s a natural way of life. The amount of energy to extract gold or oil is about 20X of what it takes to mine bitcoin. Even if you look at it from e green energy stand point. Energy is not created by saying we have 10 terawatts of power and just have to distribute it. You have to build a windmill or a dam to convert wind or water energy into electricity. The output is POW. So if you don’t really grasp how POW functions in bitcoin then you are not understanding how many things in this world uses POW. This is not a new concept. And by using energy it’s hard to cheat.

I agree with mostly what you say. And once it leaves an exchange there is very little traceability. Yes it can be done but the effort may exceeds the cost. I really think there will be a policy change in the future. But it won’t be soon. And it won’t apply to all. The IRS has targets and it’s not fiat to crypto they are looking for. It’s crypto to crypto. The mental cost for many is just enough to dissuade many from the predatory conditions on crypto exchanges. Not that I’m advocating for a tax. But these exchanges would throw you under the bus to save their skins. Maybe not Bisq but the others yes. 
I see this as a good sign for a migration out of this system but the unnecessary evils of exchanges puts up barriers. This shift to retail is just another ploy to apply pressure to the exchanges. The relative use outside of the exchanges is limited. And it’s mainly just bitcoin. So by them wanting to pursue a capital gains from you buying something is really a waste.

Make me feel silly. Your just shilling. Don’t worry your secret is out. Bitcoin is s voluntary thing. You don’t have to express your opinion on something that you don’t like. It’s just that way. Trying to come here and wake people up about you being asleep. Stick with what you got. That’s all that will remain. As for trying to sound smart no one really cares about your analogies or how you refute every topic. In a few days you can have your 2X coins till your hearts content. Bitcoin will move on without or with you. Better yet I’ll trade you if you want. You take my 2X coins and I’ll take your btc. If you own any. Probably like most shills.

The world and the area you live in is not yet developed to use bitcoin. This is both within the protocol and outside of it. Sure the price of the coin can go up without protocol additions and a well regulatory environment. 
What you are seeing at the moment is part of the process. Once institutional investors around the globe get involved we will enter another phase. You still may not use btc in your everyday life at that point. But once these ppl get comfortable with bitcoin. They will sit in boardroom across the world and put bitcoin on the table for retail. That’s when you will see the signs outside everywhere. 
Things like this take time. Usually about a generation. Or about 18 to 20 years to really penetrate into the mainstream. Bitcoin was born in 2009 but the year you start the process is from 2015 and beyond. The price this year is close to 10X. That is significant. Every year after will not exceed this. Expect 3-7X. I’m conservative and lean more to 3X  per year till the next halving. Then we will see a spectacular year at that point. But after that the gains will be in the 1.5 to 2X range. Till the next halving. Then after that spectacular year we may start to normalize into some more akin to 20% every year. By the time we reach this 20% Mark of gains you will have entered into mass adoption. 
Some of the wealthiest people in the world are not concerned with buying bitcoin today. It’s because they are more interested in wealth preservation. By this I mean bitcoin may grow to beyond being $1 million a coin before they even decide its worth it. Buying now though is very unfeasible. Imagine if $40T of worth all tried to buy within the next few years. It would lead to a bubble of all bubbles. 
By year 2021 as long as bitcoin has survived you will not see a coin worth less than $50k. Understand there are many of us not looking to get rich. We are looking to provide future generations a better world to live in. We will be attacked for along time but the fight is worth it.

Actually we don’t. And this only affects a small amount of users who trade. Most Bitcoiners just hodl. It’s just the ones who think they can make more by trading. And every capital gain is taxable. Also if you have coin on an exchange and send them to a wallet you control that is not a taxable event. Taxable events only happen at the change of ownership. So many of you who buy alts. If you buy Btc with fiat. Trade it at a profit into a shitcoin that’s a taxable event and you need to recognize that. Now if you trade your shitcoin back to btc at a profit even if you get less btc it’s still a taxable gain. So it’s more complexities added to more complexities. 
This is the world we live in. The exchanges will all fall in line to this. It’s no different than the stock market. Remember this started because the banks got bailed out and we didn’t.

This argument is false. As an example for accounting purpose. I buy 1 btc with tether for $8000 in tether. Btc rises to $9000. But I only traded with 8000 tethers. Where are you going to get the 1000 tethers to keep the credit and debit side equal. You have to create more tethers. But how can they create more tethers if they don’t add in more USD. Because tether IS NOT a dollar derivative nor does it represent one. A tether is a transfer fund within the crypto markets that allows coins that can’t be bought with USD to be able to be bought without having to buy Btc or ETH. 
There are 600 million tethers with claims to USD,BTC,and ETH. All other alts are not USD tradeable. So anyone saying that tether is used to pump btc knows nothing and is training you on his message. The message is bitcoin is dead so you should be buying BCH.

Businesses. Can run hubs too. The system does not require permission to use. But don’t expect for a business to make a profit off of running a hub. Because their will be users who will run hubs to keep cost low. Just like some businesses offer free wi di to come in their store. LN will be another way to get people in the Store. 
The benefit everyone will have is reduced fees. Businesses like Visa can’t compete. Wouldn’t you prefer to pay 0 vs 3% that merchant services offer. Plus when you pay for something using Visa the merchant doesn’t get the money for 3 weeks. With bitcoin and LN the money is settled in seconds. Merchants will no longer need short term funding to make pay roll either. 
Just this aspect alone can create 2% global growth from fee reduction. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 07:09:08
You have lost your mind. Bitcoin will not lose its value because it’s used like cash. It’s true merchants act as a supply to the markets but if you have more buyers than sellers the price still goes up. And when you buy Btc then use it to buy some good or service you have created a value effect. The price of Bitcoin will become the sum of the transactional value plus the value of its store of value. 
If merchants want you to spend your btc then they will give you some incentive. If not just use fiat. What you see occurring right now is redistribution. Whales will spend some btc. They will trade some btc too. Because no one wants to pay in btc. So they have to convert to fiat to pay bills. The same with businesses too. They pay bills in fiat.

Who cares what miners are leaning towards. They follow you. Not the other way around. If you don’t know this by now, there are plenty of altcoins with better features or faster block times than bitcoin. Look at Litecoin. It has 1MB blocks every 2.5 minutes. In Bitcoin terms that is 4MB blocks. Litecoin has segwit too. So why are the NYA shills pushing this. They could be pushing for LTC.  
Next here is what I see. The 2X chain will have segwit. But the wallets won’t enable it for users. Why should they. They aren’t right now. It’s hostage taking once again. 
Secondly, the 2X chain won’t get LN. Why? Because the developers of LN are on the 1X chain side. LN is a scaling solution that doesn’t involve those in the NYA. Basically they become obsolete. Miners will still get paid because they get a block subsidy. And even if blocks are empty they still are profitable from the exchange fiat price. 
Thirdly, investors and whales will value the chain that can innovate. These people are not stupid. And they are the ones the miners need. These whales are on the 1X chain side. Why will they value the 1X chain more. Because it has LN
LN may never be developed on the 2X chain. There is no agreement the developers of LN have to follow them.

No that’s what they do. They create tether and at times they destroy tether. The balance is maintained by what is traded by not USD only. Failed ETF’s do the same thing too. It’s pretty common in the financial world for instruments like tether. It may sound funny but that is the reality of what financial engineering is. Look at what the CME is doing. It’s exposure to btc without ever owning btc. And contracts are created and destroyed not based or backed by USD or btc just an agreement.

The idea is not to own one. The idea is to own it as a whole or in parts. Whatever you can afford to lose. The reason for this is such. The value of fiat over time buys you less and less. But the value of just some btc over time will buy you more. Even at the Satoshi level. Those who got in early are just early. At some point in time the incentive for them to use those bitcoins will be there. That’s when distribution from the few to the many will happen. At some point businesses will prefer taking bitcoin. It will be widespread. Then labor will work for companies that pay them in bitcoin instead of fiat. Just give it Time. Good money drives out bad.

Even better for those complaining about not being able to use segwit, they can just move there coins to a wallet that enables it. Instead of trying to get there wallet provider to offer it to them. It’s a shame that many are waiting for Segwit to be available when it’s obvious these wallets are not going to. People are falling for brands not the tech. If only 3 wallets have it enabled then that’s where all the users who wanted segwit should be. That sends a signal to the others.

When you do that on a futures exchange that’s the price you are locking in. The 2X side needs to pump this price but in the end the dump will drive it lower. Just like it did for BCash. 
There is one exception though. Miners do something businesses don’t do. They get rewarded coin. So they can sell BTC to prop up BCH. The businesses though don’t get a reward. So how will they prop up the price of B2X. They have to use fiat. I don’t think miners especially Jihan cartel to use there efforts to support these businesses that way. Jihan has already delivered a chain with larger blocks. Why won’t the NYA companies push using that chain. Why?

Your friend doesn’t understand that Futures themselves trade off the underlying instrument. The reason all other commodities and PM trade like they do is because Wahl Street uses warehouses to capture the supply of the commodity. What I’m saying is they own the supply. They own the supply chains. They own practically all the gold on earth. So they control its price. How much do they need to own to do this. About 10%. How much btc do they own 0%. So how do they achieve this. First setup futures. Next will come the ETF’s. This is the buy cycle. But they will not crash the price. Because hodlers are ideologues. They will buy at lower prices to get more btc no matter what. They know hodlers are not in it to have more fiat. They know out of maybe 14 million coins in wallets only 3-4 million of them actually move. So the only option to get hodlers to let go of some coins is to crack up prices to keep hodlers from buying. They have to price us all out from being able to buy one. They have to create a condition to get those 10 million coins that never move to go to a market and sell. To them fiat is unlimited.

It does have to do with the premine. Not only did he pull in 10K btc but he gave himself 500k ETH. This was all before a single block was mined. I also suspect out of the 60 million ETH in the premine he bought some with the btc he received to get more ETH. Remember this was all before the first block was mined. They all had a clue because bitcoin was gaining more traction. So it was get rich and fake it till you make it. The Bitcoiners who bought in are the usual suspects. The plan from day one was to make bitcoin obsolete. The token was sold as not money. And the foundation setup was to reduce all risk associated with the pre mine. Vitalik was surrounded by ppl who made it structured this way. ETH success is not organic at all. Many knows this.

That is not how it would work. If someone came into buying $100B of btc in the near term the price would moon. They would have to bid up what the market has available. And the markets don’t have even close to 5% of the supply of all bitcoins available. That’s less than 1.5 million coins. The rest are in wallets off the exchanges. And those off the exchanges are not trying to sell them. So the OP would just have to live with bitcoin being valued in the Trillions not billions.

I’ve learned a few things in my short life. Don’t predict the future create it. As in Bitcoin don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. And don’t sell more than you can expect to buyback at higher prices. 
I’m not an expert either. No one really knows what is gong on. The system is really that complex. So that should answer your question to why I will dump my 2X coins. Core knows code. The underlying value in bitcoin is in its code. It’s not based on how many users a company or wallet can attract. The systems design is such that the effort companies make are easy to attract people to exit into bitcoin. 
21 million coins mined at a fixed interval. 10 minute block intervals. Halving every four years. Code enforced rules by users enforcement nodes. And 1MB blocksize. If a small group of people can change this then bitcoin is not worth it to me. I might as well stick with the centralized central bank system. 
I’m not here to get rich. I’m not here to get status. I truly want to change the world. And to do that you have to change the money. The Keynesians have gone to far. My legacy (children) will have no better future unless I do something. Bitcoin is a great way to protect that future if We can keep it.  Out of the many will be one. I hope you understand that. The prophecy of thousand years of peace is upon us. 
2X is a Trojan horse. And one day you’ll see it that way. The future is fragile only because the present decisions make it fragile. This is not about a parameter. One small change today can affect the lives of billions in the future. Bitcoin is tough to change because the system relies on the many to change it. Not the few. In the process it changes us all by not being able to change. 
I can accept failure. That’s what a majority of life is failure.

Not a killer. It’s a progression. Open source works this way. Don’t take this as LN won’t be done but can be improved or have competing compatible implements to give better privacy features. What I find is the notion of centralization. The cost to run a hub is very low. If it is a funded hub then companies like Visa will have to buy bitcoin to fund the millions of potential nodes they will have. Also they will have to have wallets that lead your transaction through it’s hubs. But the low cost of entry can make it impossible for them to do this. A le cost decentralized hub network will prevail because the hub owners will have the incentive to use there hub as priority first or to be able to route around for the lowest cost path. Also merchants won’t have te need to use the third party because the cost for themselves can be internalized.

I’ll pass on that. Someone else can thank you later. But seeing you couldn’t answer my question it must mean you are in it for more fiat too. Because if you understood that it takes 5X in ETH to equal 1X in btc. If you do the math buying ETH in hopes of getting more btc is a loosing game. Plus ETH has endless inflation and won’t code to scale for another 2 yrs. Your buying hype. Other things to note: Newer exchanges are being built and deployed in the near term. They will all be offering Bitcoin not ETH. That means all new USD coming into these new exchanges will be additive to bitcoin only. A smart investor knowing this would accumulate as much btc as possible before they open for trading. But this is not what you want. You want existing peeps to pump your bags so you can thank them.

Then learn how to create a bd for your transaction. Set your own fee. Plus that same fee you are paying at $7000 a coin will most likely be $30 when btc hits $70K. And you can’t blame Core.

Off chain it maybe a few pennies.

Each layer will have transaction limits. As for LN, you won’t be sending 25 btc through it. It’s design is for micro-payments. Which in the future what we consider micro-payments May not be micro any more but they won’t be whole btc either. This means for many types of transactions you will still need the mainchain. It’s all based on design of the protocol. But there will always be fees enough to support the miners to secure the network.

Exactly. You could have got some for less than $5 in January. Plus ETH has perpetual inflation. It doesn’t have an upper limit. Another factor is Bitcoin just launched RSK. It is the same if not better for dApps and ICO’s than ETH. Another one is LN which is getting formalized and standardized for retail use. Think about this. If you are trying to fit into the mantra of deworsifying you maybe surprised. Alt coins are just test nets for bitcoin. You want an anon coin. Bitcoin will have mimble wimble.

No it’s not. Using most accumulated work is the same as using BIP 9 to signal for segwit. Stop leaving or relying on miners to define bitcoin. No matter what balance you want it’s very clear. They will not act honestly. Maybe once we get some more ASIC miner manufacturers then things can change. But under these conditions it is not advisable to rely on China manufacturers. Next year maybe things will change if 2 or 3 manufacturers enter and start taking market share from Jihan.

 What would make bitcoin a standard currency? The exchange price tends to be noisy. Main reason is because lots of ppl just buy once and that’s it. There is nothing wrong with that. But it’s far better to have a set amount to buy over intervals. That’s how you save. As much as a few will say this most ppl just buy once and then cross their fingers. The odds of the price going down after you buy is 50%. The odds of the price going up is 50%. When the price goes down you get more sats. When the price goes up you get more purchasing power. 
My plan has been for the last 7 yrs was to buy a certain amount every month. And 7 yrs ago it was far more risky. But I’m still doing the same thing. I’m just trying to get as many as I can. There is only going to be 21 million. That’s how we said it yrs back. And it still applies today. I wish you good luck and hope both of you just see that saving just takes time.

You can run a hub yourself. Just download the software and create relationships with other hubs and merchants and wallets. You create your own payment network this way. The cost to entry is less than $100. And then you can charge fees or just do like what I will do. Just make it free as long as bandwidth isn’t a problem. No business can ever compete with free. And users can leverage this to their advantage. A big city can have millions of routes to make payments fast. And the least cost in fees will always win the route traffic.

I own gold too. Physical and I have never sold a single ounce for bitcoin. I got into the bitcoin game in 2012 when the block reward was still 50. But over time as I looked further into this I realized exactly why gold prices act like they do. Because the ones who own most of the gold control the price of the gold. There is a reason for this. They don’t want gold to compete with fiat. So now you can understand why it’s this way. 
But for bitcoin it’s not that way. These ppl own 0 coins. So they can create paper contracts or whatever they want as much as they want to set bitcoin prices. It won’t work. We all know they own no bitcoin. This is a fact. They may try to use the CME, LME, CBOE, or what ever fiat exchange they want to set prices too. I won’t matter. They own no bitcoin. But they do own lots of gold. I mean lots of it.

And you find the gov not being able to default because they can print as a feature. It’s actually a bug. There is a reason I did not consider assets. It because I explained how currency is created and the effect of it as fiat or bitcoin. The assets won’t matter in this case because they apply to both. Demand for assets are supplied by fiat or btc or gold. And this demand determines the wealth effect across all income levels. Bitcoin and gold both add purchasing power to the lower levels when demand increases. Fiat reduces purchasing power when demand increases. What hurt gold was the peg. And in the future if any gov wants to peg some arbitrary number to bitcoin be advised that deflationary periods will be worse.

It’s solved the double spend within a certain limit. It solves the distribution of a digital good through mining. 
For you to reduce it down to it’s not really that different means you have no idea at what is really going on. The same as Dalio. He has no idea.

No it's a tradeoff. Problem is certain miners have moved the goal post again. Now they want EC as a patch to segwit. I'd say it's worth it. Blockspace won't be much of an issue once L2 solution come online meaningfully. People will still migrate to L2 because it will be more P2P like. Fast exchanges. No miners to make you wait hours to get confirmed. This ain't about block size. It's about usability. If core doesn't see it this way then I don't know. Competition is good. Code just doesn't do it always. They keep focusing on node blocksize but don't realize once layers evolve blocksize will not be the issue for the near and mid terms. EC won't have this ever centralizing effect they are thinking. We still have a block reward. And the higher the price for btc. That in return will bring in more manufacturers and mining pools.

You are arguing semantics. The process has never changed. Nodes enforce the rules. The signal issue with miners is a consensus mechanism. It's was never intended to let miners determine the direction of the protocol. They vote with there hash on what transactions go in the block. Also the order of blocks. Not on what changes have to be made or needed. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:51:20
This is true but the market has to give manufacturers an incentive. They have to allow prices where those newly developed miners will thrive. But you got too many Wall Street types that think lower prices punishes miners. Jihan loves lower prices. 20% more efficient miners guarantees he has no competition. Everyone wants more decentralization but the market can't do the dance to get us there. 
Now GM has revealed Jihan motivation. The market needs to move in a big up to support his confirmations. It's that simple. Market we need more mining manufacturers. Not more efficient miners.

How much do you think F2pool knows. I think signaling on Litecoin is a distraction from what the agenda is. Finding away to get the chip hack to work on segwit too. They are coordinating all of this. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:50:20
No I'm not. I'm just saying F2pool is not innocent by any means. They are trying to find a chip hack that works on segwit. If they can find one using Litecoin. The same will work on Bitcoin. They needed time to get the miners to deploy. You just don't create those over night. Once you find one that works in segwit for Litecoin. Then you mass produce them to mine on Bitcoin. Next you repackage old miners and sell at a discount after you made your money off them. And after they are rendered obsolete for efficiency. That's how Bitmain does it. Sell 5000 old miners to retail as new. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:14:45
Satoshi didn't have a consensus when he made changes to the protocol. He just rolled it out to the nodes to enforce. The consensus we relate to is the order of transactions only. Miners never set the size limit of the blocks. The rules changed after Satoshi left.  A power vacuum of sort. People like Roger were never involved in the code side. Not even considered in the discussion. Most of it is in the open. Look it up. Notice the software changes vs miner signaling. You'll notice with Satoshi there was no such thing as signaling. We don't need miners to signal for anything. Core just needs to roll out a change to the nodes with a date when those rules will be enforced. The attack is based on weak governance. Take that role back from miners and restore it to the way Satoshi had it. Bitcoin is still young.

It was a sidetrack. And they were being used as pawns. But now a new revelation has come about and they acted accordingly. Covert mining chips will be addressed in every protocol proposal. The very nature of decentralization depends on it. Jihan has not come forward after Purse has stated ext blocks will incorporate the chip hack denial. Waiting on Jihan. 
EXT blocks no matter the critique is a step forward too. Being compliant with segwit is great too. Other devs I hope you are paying attention. Your code is not to safeguard miners profits. It's to safeguard Bitcoin. 
I have said it before and I will say it again. Security and decentralization is what keeps Bitcoin being Bitcoin. If miners or other parts of the community want you to act or write code that will expressly only benefit them you are doing it  wrong. Let's get back to being inclusive and not exclusive.

POW is to validate transactions and the order they go in blocks. They vote with their hash. Changes were done by Satoshi by updating nodes on rules to follow. After he left there was confusion an a power vacuum. All the meetings seem to have clouded what was the intent of protocol changes. 
Consider that. You can read it yourself. Satoshi never stated miners signal for acceptance of a change in the rule set. That got made up afterwards. Miners were the only ones at the table. How could Satoshi do it without knowing how many nodes were out in the wild and we can't do it now. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:54:50
It's not even that. The question is Jihan denying segwit a fair shake. I don't think Greg is making an allegation that can't be substantiated. He has clearly stated the difference between the two version of the ASICboost. He has clearly stated the characteristics of the covert chip hack. Which means this was not an overnight issue. They have been studying this for awhile. 
Seeing this relates to efficiency it's more than just looking at blocks. That's just part of characterizing the chip signature. Bitmain does the same thing when they are readying a miner for production. 
There is a simple solution to this. One they can signal and run segwit when it has been adopted. Two they can run the new update BIP as Greg has put forward. Three they can do nothing. 
One and two are desirable. Three is not. Here's why. Any manufacturer or soon to be manufacturer can ask Greg for his test and results for the chip hack. If it's not covered by a patent then they can produce miners that saves 30% on electrical cost. Even more efficient than an Antminer. That's how the hardware industry works. Bitmain can deny the claims all they want but if a new miner manufacturer evolves and uses this technology then Bitmain loses. Also Greg could run the patent himself and license it out. Or just put it out in the public domain. The last is not what Bitmain will want. 
Now it's out in the open. Bitmain can't make this stop now. These are scientist working

No a HF is a full node referendum. That means everyone has to follow a new rule set. Soft forks only tighten the existing rule set. It's not about who has to upgrade. It's about how rules are followed. 
Miners have an incentive to make more money than they spend trying to find blocks. But nodes have a greater incentive that is beyond profits. Nodes enforce the rules we all follow. I don't know how many times Luke has to say or explain it. The power always lies in the full nodes. Not just economic nodes but all full nodes. The more full nodes we have the more powerful Bitcoin becomes.

Now a new issue is coming to play. If Bitmain is willing and able to stop segwit over an efficiency issue. What will Bitmain do when Ext Blocks does the same thing. You can't keep repeating the same mistake expecting a different result.

Stop mistaking miners as the central authority for change. It started out as a developer issue of one person and one person only. He didn't talk about consensus either.  Code is law. Not miners.

The statement you said is by far as false as it can be. Bitcoin is not deflationary. It’s disinflationary. It holds this unique property by not being physical. But at some point in the future that’s what the world will need. In terms of hyperinflation the best use for your fiat is to buy assets. They will increase in value. Some of the best performing stock markets are in those countries with hyperinflation. 
As for most advanced economies the real issue is hyperdebtflation. If debt grows at 5% and interest rates are at 3% you are not getting any better. There is no way to get even. That is not the point of this either. You are all being trapped into a system not meant to sustain itself.

If you didn't realize segwit is a blocksize increase. Call it what you want but segwit nodes will accept up to 4MB of segwit transactions. The only difference is non segwit nodes will not have the witness data. So rightt now a 1MB block can handle 2300 transactions. After segwit and all segwit style transactions that number triples. 
Other issues effect what the blocksize should be. Like propagation and bandwidth. Decentralization is another key to keeping Bitcoin successful. 
Then you have to see what segwit actually does when it comes to just raising the blocksize. 1MB becomes 4MB. So a HF to 2MB with segwit creates basically 8MB of capacity. The miners know this. 
Last one thing Satoshi said that should stick. The other implementation would be a menace. And what do we have. Competition to be the other implementation. It's that simple. Why do nations have 1 constitution, because any other national constitution would be a menace.

The development of the Bitcoin protocol is very decentralized. More than mining is. Stop believing these guys by thinking Core is one team. It's not. It's 100's of developers. The term core started by none other than the ones who hate it. Stop playing make believe with them.

It's not that hard. You can define it in terms as such. " Any entity that facilitates the use or transfer of Bitcoin as a daily activity via hardware or software provided to or for those said activities. Said activities are defined as trading exchanges, wallet providers, data analytics services, software developers, hardware development. Each shall have a representative of nodes presented based on its customer base. Customer base will be define as any Bitcoin user with a valid wallet that contains any amount of Bitcoin beyond 0.  Yada yada yada. 
This way you don't treat a a day trader like a coinbase. Also Coinbase style companies can only be accounted for as many nodes as they have customers. So no Bitcoin.com can't just go out a fire up 200 nodes to spoof the vote. Basically a republic style representation to prevent the tyranny of the majority. Or from one entity acquiring nodes to block or stall. This is how pools should have been able to signal. No matter how big or small the pool is. Each pool gets one signal and then a representation of its hash rate. I.E one signal per 100 petahash. A 300 petahash pool gets 4 signals.

This is a factor between price and user base. But this doesn't account for coin supply. As new users buy Bitcoin the available supply decreases. Then you have the halving every four years. This must be accounted for. 
Unlike the internet Bitcoin does not have an everlasting supply. But it's a good analysis. If the user base grows faster than Bitcoin inflation then prices could be tremendous. Or it could be zero. Time will tell

No one is trying to hinder a Bitmain from using the overt efficiency. We just don't want it to be the divide between moving forward or not. Covert chip hack for whatever reason should be an unacceptable form for use. So let's stick to making progress and inclusivity vs dictating how miners should operate. We don't like when they want to dictate bitcoins path. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:35:46
Yes miners do always want to have an edge. But when that edge prevents progress or an advancement in the protocol it's not ok. 
This same scenario has played out time and time again throughout history. Bitmain is on the wrong side. Every advancement in technology outdates some other technology innovation. Telecommunication companies did everything they could to stop the internet. The excuse. It's will hurt there profits. No one cares about a companies profits. No one cares if you are the industry leader. 
Oil companies found out the hard way. Fracking was a detriment to their profits. Then came out the FUD campaign. The water catching on fire. The environmental damage and many other campaigns to stop fracking. OPEC and major oil companies spent billions trying to get social attitudes to change. Trying to get legislation to ban fracking. Hiring environmentalist to due the dirty work. This is all done to protect there profits. 
But what do we have today. Cheaper gas at the pump. It's hard to stop progress and change of this nature. Profits are not a good excuse. It never will be. All advantages will likely become obsolete. 
Bitmain is learning the hard way. They are misión mining look like villains. China is making itself look like a bully. 
Time for an upgrade is here. Segwit is ready. I don't care how much less Bitmain or any miner makes by progress. Blocking, stalling or any other techniques to stop it are futile. Reputational risk are hard to repair. If they ever get repaired. What Bitmain is doing to protect there profits has proven time and time again as a waste. It will happen once others realize it's not there concern if Bitmain makes any money.

The cat is out of the bag. We know this. No one wants to protect Bitmain profit except probably BU. Unless BU devs didn't know about this and find they are actually tools. All code will prevent this chip hack from being effective. This is not just a Core issue. You don't want to be the development team that shows favoritism to one mining pool.  
The more Bitmain pushes back the more it proves they are trying to tailor the protocol to keep this edge over other miners. Developers should care less about Bitmain profits. If they were smart they would retool it for Segwit and not said a word or fought it. 
LTC tripled on the breaking thresh hold for Segwit. So Bitmain is trying to save 30% on electrical cost vs 300% in Btc price appreciation. What kind of business is he running. That's $25k more per block vs $300 dollars in saving. He has to be the worst business inclined person I know. This effects all miners. $100 million in cost saving vs boosting revenue to over $1B. The numbers just don't add up.

Look lower prices or crashes are not helping. The sense of urgency doesn't come from fear of not making a profit. It comes from fear of competition. 
You have to understand the problem. Saudi pumps oil at a profit around $10. But the price of oil hovers $50. This keeps an adequate amount of competition in the space. Storage tanks are full but demand is working at this supply. OPEC said they were going to cut but reality is they didn't. It was seasonal decline. They want everyone to cut a little to bring the supply demand balance. But some countries like the US can't coordinate because it is against the law. So those drillers keep drilling to pay bills. 
The market knows this so it's just a matter of managing supply levels and decentralization. Higher prices will bring more drillers online but will bring more decentralization. The negative is storage tank levels will get too high. Lower prices will lower decentralization and will allow tanks to lower. But this concentrates drilling companies to those just in the ME and state run companies. It's a balancing act. 
Then you have all the rhetoric. It's the real game theory playing out. It's been playing out for decades. But now markets are trying to keep the level of decentralization without over filling tanks too. It about price. 
So keeping this with the same as Bitcoin. The market hasn't come to terms that we don't have decentralization fully achieved yet. Asic manufacturers are a narrow option. This is the supply. Then you have the electricity prices to contend with. And China is taking full advantage of both of these aspects. This is the underlying to Bitcoin and its issue of coming to consensus. We have a cartel. They play rhetoric. They play the market. 
In my opinion there are two ways to alleviate this situation. 1 We can get segwit. This will lead to off chain solutions activating. This will introduce competition. But miners get the say on it. Basically they have to act against there own interest. This is cartel thought. 2. The market can increase the price and more manufacturers can enter the space with a better risk reward. Then more mining pools can start. These will be different pools than the existing pools. It will dilute there market share. Yes further decentralization. Which means signaling concentration will extend beyond China. This is what we need for the future. 
At which price will more manufacturers of asic take on risk. My guess is about $5000 to $10000. This price range has to persist for months or a year or two. That sets the electricity low profitability at around 8 to 9 cents per kWh range. This is 35% of the world. 
This was long sorry. Just trying to code in change doesn't work all the time.

Some miners went over to BCash. It really helps when they do that because it changes the inflation schedule for btc. Which means the btc on the market gets stripped away due to low supply from the miners. Eventually traders will find less liquidity per unit fiat and the price will correct for this. 
Over time as the LN network expands to more use cases and more coins circulate on LN then we may not need consistent 10 min blocks 24/7. Those who keep coins on the main chain are hodlers at this point. And those on LN can still transact no matter what the miners do.

How do I know I’m doing it right? I’m not too concerned with how low it will go. I don’t measure my gains or losses in fiat. I measure my gains and losses in btc. And for years I’ve only had gains. I don’t dilute myself with diversification because having more bitcoin and more altcoin does me no good. I measure my gains in btc. Not btc equivalents. Just dollar cost average and set a goal at how many btc you want. When the price goes down you get more. When they price goes up you get less. Either way it’s a gain.

This could change ur currently markets think Bitcoin is oil. Trying to keep the price at the margin of cheap electricity (subsidized or not). A higher price for btc will reward current miners but will also allow for more manufacturers to enter to sell to future miners or pools. Once you break the manufacturer centralization the rest can decentralize. And obviously for that we need higher prices. Fiat style investor keep thinking a lower price will punish the Chinese pools. That's exactly what they want though. It leads to less competition. Which means more coins for them. The goal is to decentralize more. Can't do it till we get more asic manufacturers. 
Second point is higher prices allow miners or pools with higher electrical cost to compete. And that's what Chinese miners don't want. Competition.

Actually the economic actors in bitcoin will be regulated. Most are to some extent. You can’t just give them an email address and a burner card and buy bitcoin. Those days are gone. But if you are suggesting regulate at the protocol level you are very mistaken. There is no way one country can influence the protocol to suit there needs. Please accept that. The protocol and the network are neutral to politics. I’m sure any government can fork bitcoin whenever they want. They can compel its citizens to use it. But it will have no value to them. Changing features to a centralized system just creates a higher tech centralized system. But bitcoin gives anyone in the world government or not a chance to participate without having to worry if your enemies can use it against you. This is not a mindset. It’s a path that we are taking. I’m not bitching and I know if I participate others will to. It’s a common bond that humans share fundamentally. 
I find this conversation as an awakening to those who really don’t understand how the world can change regardless of those who can’t accept changes. Let’s extrapolate for a second and look to the past. History serves as our guide. And I’m not the one trying to say regulations is a bad thing. It’s just how it is applied. If it can enable mankind to bypass the gatekeepers and meets the true spirit of do no harm in for it. But if it enables the gatekeepers the advantage over the rest of us it’s not a change. 
I’ve recommended to my state reps on many occasions what seems plausible path to move forward. And it never is about hindering bitcoin. It’s never about Blockchain the so called underlying tech. Try sitting in a room with bankers the like with a clueless legislator. I didn’t have to explain anything. I have proof. I have a node. I have a wallet. I have a miner. I can show them what the network looks like. The total hash rate. The transactions that happen. Even seeing bitcoin to them as a demonstration. And after that they too wonder what the bankers are in a fuss about. It’s no different than sending an email. Do we regulate that. No. 
Most people who use or have bitcoin are not criminals or money launderers. No matter what someone says it’s just not for those types. So what is to regulate. People’s expectations.

The only thing I can compare market wise about bitcoin is the bond market. With a little splash of nat gas ( widow maker ). Back in the 90’s even though an established trend was set the street was determined that rates would never go below X. So like a fool I bought bonds because 0% looked like the end game to me. Or atleast that’s what my charting was telling me. I got laughed at too. When 0% many would say. 
Bonds are macro. The boomers didn’t buy bonds but everything was priced in bonds. Especially housing. But to make a long story short as borrowing cost went lower housing prices went higher. Boomers were getting richer. And that’s all it was. And we still haven’t reached 0% yet but we are one recession away from it. 
Bitcoin is in the transition period of capturing a generation or 2. Just like a falling bond market captured the boomers. Yet the market influencers who are boomers hate bitcoin with a passion. Just like the Silent gen hated bonds and wanted the gold standard back. It’s generational. Traders will make money because that’s the very nature of what you do. I’m not a trader and have long term themes of macro trends. Bitcoin is that new macro trend. And the boomers are trying hard to do there best to make sure it won’t exist. But it will. We have different approaches to this but the results will be the same. This is bigger than us all. And it’s best we steward it in so went don’t cause hazards and risk to future generations. And you know how trends work. The acceleration to the downside is no different than the blow off top. And there is more money looking to get into this to restore the order of how things get done. Yes lots of retail needs to get wiped out. They have. Lots of early investors who got complacent need to get wiped out. And they are. All the mal investment needs to be cleared. That’s happening right now. We need to go lower to truly clear it out. Only then can the true nature of what Satoshi started come to light.

This is not a revolution. Let’s get that straight. This is called progress. Back in the 90’s this was talked about and even tried. Many, many times it was tried. It was not a revolt. It’s always been about technology. Technology takes us to space. Technology has greatly improved the lives of billions. When technology starts to take over it is pretty much a replacement, not an upgrade, for the system. Technology is replacing money. It was only a matter of time. And with that will come a new mindset towards regulations. They will be hard to enforce but do we really need all of it. No! There are more people who are siding with using tech to do no harm vs scammers or colluding politicians and business types. And no I don’t ignore laws with impunity. I follow the nature of humans and seek to never cause harm to another. I’m not trying to protect a system that protects those who will do harm to other with no regards. They right the laws.

Ppl will still hoard it till there is very little upside to it. That’s what the world needs to understand. The greatest transfer of wealth is upon us and we trade these like they are some kind of stock. If I was a billionaire I would get with other billionaires and just put a floor under the price. That way 99.9% could never ever be able to afford to buy one. The only ones left would be Nation States and corporations.

You sound frustrated about the price. That’s what driving you. Here’s a hint for you from me. I buy the all time high. I buy the all time lows. I buy all in between. It’s not about how much more fiat I can gain. It’s always been about more satoshi’s. And sure regulations will come. But as the saying goes. Give me control of my money and I care not what laws you create. That’s a spin on the Rothschild quote. 
What will they regulate. On and off ramps. Which they do right now for the most part. Look at what they are doing in Japan. They are shutting down opportunistic exchanges. Those do more harm than good because it gives the bad actors and escape route. Look at Conbase. They are beefing up on all levels. Look at Core the loosely united development team. They are still writing code. Look at S. Korea and the policies they are creating. Look at Russia. Look at Canada front for housing hashrate. Look at the states and countries that are writing legislation to facilitate bitcoin as payment for taxes. I mean really. If you take the word of some no name professor without looking into the world that is happening then I don’t know what to say. Apparently you don’t see that people want money to be separated from state control. There are millions of us spread throughout the world. There are those who are looking to get rich quick but they are noise. 
@_date: 2017-04-11 11:17:52
I believe exactly that too. Core should have never let it get this far. Segwit should have not been signaled on. Just set rule date to follow. Other soft forks turned political too. That is the issue. Devs make code. Code is the rules. Miners are just users of code. We don't need their input ever.

There is no such thing as income equality in crypto. No one gets paid in it. But the OP statement is true. If you took the global 99% and they all bought bitcoin in an amount they could afford to lose a great transfer of global wealth will be in bitcoin. That’s the point. 
The fiat system will die. Or atleast the currencies in them will. That’s what happens when you inflate them away. Our system is to create a debt to create new money. So hyperinflation is more of hyperdebtflation. Your money becomes worthless either through printing or borrowing. The later is not going to be paid back. And if it did the the next 4 generations will suffer from a less quality of life mainly due to the debt the boomers forced on us for:
Medical care
The last one is huge. Think about that. Younger generations are not the most taxing on the medical industry. The biggest generation we have seen before the millenials are living longer. But they get sick and to provide care for them is adding up bigly. They had an intial transfer of wealth from the silent generation to them. And now there is a transfer of wealth from Gen X and millenials to them. The worst part is as a whole the boomers have 75% of the National wealth. So they are taking the savings or potential to save from us. They are not putting anything into the economy. And most have not cashed out their stocks and bonds. This is one reason most of them hate bitcoin and crypto. They want us to keep it going and making them richer. 
They have captured the political system and have no clue what the future brings for us. They have no incentive. But we are the incentive. This is why I buy and hodl bitcoin. I store my wealth in it. And when it does disrupt the old wealth storage system I will not worry one bit. My kids are covered. I am covered. It’s a long term fix to a long term situation. If you don’t see it, it’s because it’s your way of life. It’s so engrained that you are unable to understand the ramifications of lowering taxes and increasing debt. That’s not how you do it. You can’t keep giving the rich and the poor more. Someone someday will have to suffer. And it’s us.

I think most of you misinterpret what the intent of taxes is for. By creation it is friction for the federal reserve monetary system. The concept is to tax just high enough to keep money from being hoarded. The rich will pay a higher amount and the poor will benefit from this because they will receive that amount from the government. This creates what we call velocity. At some point the government or the Fed won’t need to create new money or will so as the population grows. But what we have today in the misconception of what taxes are. This is driven by the rich to do exactly the opposite of tax collection. To hoard! 
Under a bitcoin world this same nature will need to apply strictly. If not instead of creating more units the value of each bitcoin will increase. Which is not a bad deal. Because the poor will be richer just as much in proportion as the rich. Just add a zero. But the true goal is not to get to the point of always having btc grow in value. The point will be to have an inflation rate equal to zero or as close as possible. But no one knows what the terminal value should be at that point. But it would be in the Trillions.

There is no democracy. There is no voting. Each person or entity runs what they want to run. If you don’t mine or run a node you are just a customer to bitcoin not a user. If I run code that is not compatible with other users it’s not bitcoin. Each node is self sovereignty. Participating means more than having a wallet and owning coins. You have to run code. And unlike a democracy there is no 51% determines the rules for the 49%. 
I’m not trying to be harsh or toxic. Bitcoin by design is neutral to your social and political beliefs. It’s code. If users socially disagree with the code through a consensus then the code is wrong and changes will be made by them. Not ppl who own more coins. Not by voting. Not by politicking. Not by committee. And not by rule of the 51%. It takes every node and miner to agree. 
I’m happy about your enthusiasm. I encourage you to spread it. I encourage you to run a node or mine. I encourage you to save in btc. The more the merrier. But bitcoin is nothing like a democracy. It a peer to peer consensus driven unicast protocol.

I would consider this type of ICO if btc was worth $1 million or more but at this point no way. The real estate will appreciate at 5-7% yearly while btc will do 200-300%. And seeing the token is tied to Real Estate it can only appreciate 2X of 5-7% yearly. It’s not a good deal to buy those coins from then in any manner

I’m afraid you have never been in the monetization of an asset. As I have said before you are trading and not pricing. You maybe confident in your short term strategy but I’m sorry real trends are made thru decades. Hold may not work in the stock market because interest rates around the world are still close to zero. Yes the boomers made a lot from just buying and holding for the simple fact that rates went from 20% to zero. It made Warren Buffet who he is. It made Bill Gross who he is. Now with Bitcoin a few will become the new rich for many decades to come. 
Unlike your futures or your CFD’s I can take custody of the underlying on an easy deliver. And when the institutions come in you may get crushed thinking this is your same old stock or commodity. 
I admire your 12k call but I’ve called this since $3. See how that works. I’ve called bonds to zero since 12% too. It’s a trend. They happen. But this confirms what I’ve always thought. Too many traders speculating on a very immature tech. This is not even mainstream. So don’t be bearish for life or you maybe a gold bug hoping the gold standard is coming back. It’s not going to happen. Banks can’t compete with the internet. Governments can’t compete with the internet. Markets can’t compete with the internet.

Bitcoin solved one thing that digitally has alluded the computer world for decades. Double spending. Get out of here having this blind faith that blockchain will be what keeps bitcoins promise. You still don’t understand. Quite frankly it took me 3 yrs to get it. All references are in the white paper. Anyone reading what you said is going to be mislead. But my take is don’t worry about trying to understand bitcoin. Just buy it. Hodl it. Use it. It works and has for 10 yrs. How many understand the financial system. Not many. And they still use fiat. How many understand the central banks. And they still use fiat. How many drive cars and can’t change a tire or replace oil. And they still drive. I’m here to tell you ppl do things all the time with things they don’t understand. At some point it becomes more about how to use vs how it works. That excuse is what blockchainers use to get noobs to go blockchain not bitcoin. Oh don’t buy bitcoin because you don’t understand it.

You miss the whole premise of what Bitcoin is about. You have no idea of what money is and how it evolves. Take sometime and research it. The value of fiat hoarded around the world exceed $12T. That’s a T. 
When this fiat system was created in 1913 do you know the policies they created with it. To keep it circulating they charged a high tax. They enacted laws against excessive savings too. Why? To keep it in circulation. You can do this with fiat or a currency that has no supply limit. But for those other objects in life the market is the best method for us to agree upon value. 
You consider Bitcoin doomed because no one uses it. That is the exact way they want you to think. Hodling is using. No one uses gold either for transactions. And governments will do anything to keep its price steady. They own most of it so they are the market. It’s about confidence. If gold was $20K per ounce, you think anyone would use a government issued fiat. No. They’d go to gold hot spots and work to get it. 
You been indoctrinated into thinking the best has yet to come. But it’s already here. Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Reddit, and many others have faced the same challenges to thought. But they are still here and dominating. So question yourself why you don’t want to accept the Bitcoin affect. Or just do like the rest and create your own coin. Then try to get 200K random people in the world to run your code. Try to get billions of fiat to exchange for it. Sounds pretty easy. Anyone can do it. And by the marketplace many are trying. And you are exactly the target they want to reach. Incapable of having thoughts for yourself. Just repeat what you have read and spin it as an original thought. Yes many have said the exact same things you have said for 9 years. Even the most powerful bankers too have said exactly what you wrote. Envy

And at this moment it’s not legal tender. Seriously do you think our fore fathers from just 1913 would ever imagine Amazon. No you wind up with a Teddy Roosevelt who will go at lengths to break up a monopoly. Or another Roosevelt who will raise taxes on the rich to pay off the national debt.

Having most altcoins get fiat to alt won’t solve anything or make that coin any better. These are speculative projects that don’t have any real uses in the real world. You can put as much fiat into them and will still get the same results. 95% will fail. Several of them that are billion valuations will fail. Look at LN. An investment of $2.5 million was made and it is deployed on the main net with 1000 plus nodes and actual users using it.

Look if this is the making by Wahl Street they are doing this completely wrong. The average cost of all Bitcoins is less than $500. And prior to 2017 it’s even less. So they are not going to get many hodlers to sell. It will require some miners to sell to stay alive but that is less than 200k coins. Then you run into the lower it goes it makes it cheaper for hodlers to buy one. And it makes it cheaper for the average person to buy one too. And until 2020 there is only going to be 684K a year. 
Next we have the lightning network growing worldwide. Countries are becoming more friendly to accepting bitcoin as a payment. Even passing legislation. And then you have a few hundred thousands of ppl like me who buy $x amount each month no matter what. We are ideological. That’s how we save. So the lower it goes we get more bitcoin for less fiat. 
So at what point is this a bear market. Because a chart says so. I think not. The tech boom in the 90’s was companies. The internet never crashed. It only got bigger. And bitcoin just like the internet is a protocol.

Here is the issue I see with you. First you are trying to be some savior. I told you so. Look at all those who bought in at the top. Who knows if bitcoin is not MySpace. Second is no one is asking you to buy it. No one is trying to convince you to buy it. Each individual makes that choice for themself. Third many or most who bought when it was really low don’t have those coins anymore. They don’t regret it either and they keep accumulating. Really out of 17.6 million coins about 4 million of them are lost. A guy was even combing thru a garbage site trying to find his coins on a laptop he threw away. And those many that have lost coins are not here bashing bitcoin for not knowing the future. Understand this. You have ppl that want bitcoin to go up. So they buy. But you also have many ppl who want bitcoin to go down too. And it’s not just bankers, Wahl Street traders, and politicians. It’s the 2018 other projects too that want bitcoin to go down and end. That is so they can be the one true coin. The projects just under bitcoin are the main ones. Have you ever seen Vitalik take pictures with known bitcoin attackers like Ver and CSW. Yes Vitalik is one of those guys who wants to destroy all value bitcoin has so it’s ETH on top. Same with XRP and BCash.

Learn history. The problem with a backed currency is counterparts risk. The US tried this. Then in the 1970’s Nixon closed the gold window because the rest of the world would have taken the gold and left them with worthless paper that has nothing to back it. Backing a fiat currency is only for confidence. You take something that can be printed unlimited with something that is limited. What could go wrong? Do they have all the gold they say they have. Do they have enough gold to be redeemed to replace the fiat they are backing. Are they going to continuously devalue the fiat as time goes by. It sounds good if you own gold. But for those who don’t it will be no different than what we have today. Or any different than what we had pre 1970. Of the rest of the world really thought this was a solution then they would all be stock piling gold. If the markets thought this would be great gold would be higher much higher than it is today. Money that has no control via the state or large banks and corporation is what the world needs.

Economically speaking, hodling fiat is not a wise choice. Fiat has an unlimited supply. So the more they hodl the more the central banks have to print. Or better yet governments have to borrow. They actually understood this in the past. It was discouraged to hoard fiat. High taxes caused friction at the top earners. But overtime it eroded the value of fiat to what it is today. Lowering taxes, decreasing trade barriers, supporting anti competitive practices have all contributed to what we see today.

My advice to many and I’ll repeat this again. Get your coins off the exchanges. It’s that simple. There is precedence to what I’m saying. Gold! When the US government seized the gold from citizens they didn’t go from house to house. The gold was in the bank already. They just told the banks not to let ppl redeem gold. They were given paper in return. From the pictures ppl were not standing in line to turn there gold in. They were being given paper. 
Another thing you fail to see. Just the boomer demographic. 1% of the boomers own 95% of the Boomer wealth. Most boomers are just as broke as we are. They are sustained thru entitlements. They all have some debt. They were not good savers. So looking at the wallets for bitcoin is shocking. Satoshi owns 5%. But he’s not showing up. And the market cap is very small based on the alternative fiat system. You are looking at billions and comparing it to tens of trillions.

But the incentive to spend is just not there yet. Rightly so if you think about it. Imagine how many things in this world cost $4k. Imagine how many homes are in this world that cost over $150k. Now if your number exceeds 21 million you can see what I’m talking about. Most ppl today that own 1 btc are looking at something greater than buying a tv. Some are considering hodling on till it can buy them a house. Basically it’s about your purchasing power. Notice I didn’t say gains or profits but purchasing power. Things like LN are being built for when the day comes when most ppl in the world are priced out of buying 0.1btc. It may take some a lifetime to be able just to afford 0.5 btc. But usage will come when the purchasing power of bitcoin meets not the GDP level of a nation state but the purchasing power to buy a house and more with just 1 btc.

Blockchain is not the game changer. And to remove the third party requires more than just having a replicated database. That’s why proof of work exist. The Blockchain does validate a transaction exist but proof of work allows it to be placed in a block timestamped to remove the double spend.

That’s not consensus. You can always opt for a system that requires little resource effort to be a participant. Ie Democratic protocols but they too will result in chain splits. In bitcoin developers will write code and then it is up to nodes miners and wallet developers to accept that code. It has nothing to do with politics. If no one runs that code then you just have to accept that. 
Newer projects can update or upgrade faster. They don’t have any scale. Just wait till this proof of stake gets submitted to the ETH community.

You can’t do that with fiat. The inflation tax is always there. If the system included something in the nature of causing greater friction for those who collect fiat above inflation you could have a more sustainable system. 
Bitcoin is only deflationary when you look at the most significant digit. 21 million coins. But after the decimal point it is possible to add more zeros. This adds inflation. Instead of deflating past fiat you will actually make those who have any btc richer just by adding one 0. Those at the top benefit. But those at the bottom benefit also. The world could get away with only needing 1 million btc in circulation to provide economic activity. You just need a larger amount of satoshi’s.

Bitcoin has an attack surface but it is minimal compared to the rest. The largest attack surface bitcoin has is its social attack surface. There is an on going attack socially. Technical attacks seemed to be limited since users are not required to update code when Core or any development team pushes one out. Call it being very cautious. If you saw what has happened with ETH recently you’ll notice the difference. We treat consensus within all protocol entities vs developers just deciding for us. It all comes down to game theory. This can make it frustrating to newcomers but understand.

I don't know what the intent is. But any one can do this. Banks can do this. They did it with the gold standard. What I'm curious to find out is the supply or quantity of off chain coins. And yes you can use this to transfer value of stolen coins. You can even transfer value of coins you don't own on the main chain. That's a little speculative. But the way I see it as there is no right formed for the coins on chain.

In the current fiat regime inflation is the expansion of the supply of money. It's been that way for centuries. It's a unit devalue system. 
If people make more in wages and they use the excess to invest causes asset prices to inflate. But what we have is not people making more to inflate assets. The ones creating the money are bypassing the wages and just buying assets. All the inflation is sitting in the markets or offshore and being stored or hoarded.

My coin are just fine as they are. If you think the hash war means anything then you have not been around long enough to understand. If hash rate moves then blocks slow down. If blocks slow down then less btc is produced. With less btc produced it means less miners have to sell. Either way it corrects it self. The hash rate is down from 2 weeks ago. And none of it moved to BCH. Most likely this is an excuse by a few to take hashrate off because they are mining at a loss. They can’t just say we are losing money.

He invested in debt that at the time was bad debt looking for a hair cut. It did and blew up. But he didn't disclose it till the books started burning. Then he started throwing money at stuff. He bought Bitcoin for himself and for the fund at the top. He bought into hype. Then it crashed. 
FIG got pissed and gave him an exit. They bought back his shares at a discount. And the Bitcoin he bought for the fund they kept. They passed those into a new fund they started. Pantera Capital. From there it was wishing for good luck. The Macro fund eventually closed shop and it was over.

Not many do accept bitcoin. And those that do find that not many ppl use it. But how do you get your 5% in btc from bitcoin. Easy open an exchange account and on a weekly basis take the 5% of gross receipts and just buy Btc on an exchange. 
It sounds great to say that ppl are willing to pay you in btc. But the reality is not many will. It’s not as widespread as you think. And it’s gross value is not as big as you think compared to fiat currencies. 
I’ve had several ppl in my area who think their products or services are so great anyone will pay them in btc. This is not the case. Even if you post a big discount it’s not the case. As I’ve said before I’ve got several businesses in my area who will accept btc for payment as a way to get btc. But if no one does it they still take a certain amount of income and convert it to btc.

Actually CB’s could use bitcoin as a monetary tool. It could be very effective and carries very little if any counterparts risk. They could effectively drive the price up high enough to cause real inflation. This will drive up interest rates too. But seeing that btc is in the wild and not dependent on banks the public won’t be forced into recession. But it would make governments stop taking on debt to fund operations. Seeing that governments can’t take on more debt they’d have to raise taxes. Once taxes are raised those who are the richest can’t just borrow and invest for future growth. They’d have to actually produce something. Some businesses may not make it out. Those are the ones swimming naked. 
When interest rates are high enough then the private capital can re enter the market and get a return on capital. There will be a readjustment period for asset prices but as I say it will be for the best. We can still be on the fiat system in parallel with btc. But at some point while all the debt gets paid off. All the corrupt politicians, agencies, and business leaders get flushed out. Then we can enter a world of post bitcoinization.

Well if the node is capable of 1GBPS and has sufficient liquidity then it maybe able to handle a load like that. The other point is are you considering the end points as the tx or the passing of coins per node as a tx. Define what you are saying. 
I don’t know how you could measure the throughput of a decentralized network. I firmly believe bitcoin and many others do not make great means of payments yet due to the total liquidity which is measured in the market cap. Other reasons that merchants globally can accept it and at this market cap they will wind up with all the coins too. We are still in the innovation stage. This has a long way to go. But the foundations are being built. Many choices are out there for consumers to use. And traders still don’t know how to price anything. 
It took bitcoin 9 years to get here. So there is time needed for LN to create a network effect on top of bitcoins network effect. LN needs wallets for smart phones too. So until that time there is no need to worry about capacity. Even the other so called payment rails are hardly used except Steemit. But the big factor that comes to play is bitcoin with LN is putting infrastructure first vs marketing to get a higher coin price.

It is the top request. I will tell you why. They can't find a wallet to deposit those coins. So they are stuck. It has nothing to do with we want to use BCash. Nor is it Bread responsibility to point them in the right direction. Bitpay offers full support and a wallet for them to deposit coins. BTC.com does too. And that will lead to them dumping coins. They want that 12% crypto dividend that many got. They fear BCH will go to zero. 
I laugh at this because you are taking this to fit your agenda. So don't take this personal. These complaints are wallet wide. People want to dump there BCH and buy more BTC. Bread has already given them away to transfer out. BCH only has a few off ramps. But most of them are not available to all.

You make quite a few speculations on the effect of Bakkt. OTC does not bypass the market making process. So you don’t know if they will effect the price. Bitcoin miners don’t enter into any agreement to forward sale to keep the price steady. Unlike other commodities the supply is fixed yet the difficulty to mine Bitcoin increases even if hash rate stays the same. As for ppl using bitcoin for payments with Bakkt. It’s a show me attitude. They may not succeed. If they do it will spur some growth but most likely the effect will be little. Usage has no effect on success. Look at gold no one uses it and it has a $8T market cap. Yet you don’t see anyone providing a facility to make payments in gold a success. 
Next the main concern is not the exchange. It’s the tax issue. That’s why many don’t spend it. It’s the geffin goods mentality. Ppl will spend USD before they spend BTC. No matter how you paint it Bakkt only provides another on ramp. 
Buying directly from mining farms is a big red flag. Why would a miner sell to Bakkt if they can get a better price somewhere else. Because they are Bakkt is not a good reason. I’ve known miners to hodl coins waiting for a better price to sell. 
Crypto market conditions. It’s a bunch of bots trading against each other. That’s why they all trade the same more or less. If anyone thought Bakkt was going to be immediately positive price would reflect it. And it’s not.

That’s was very long and drawn out. You made your point. Clearly you think institutional investors are shying away. Well the point is they want a system like they already have. And custody is part of it. Never mind when I say who are these institutional investors. I must mean insurance companies, endowments, retirement providers and such. They by law have a clear written standards they have to go by. It’s not their money. Being bitcoin does not make it any different than a stock or equity in a business when it comes to them. You can look at the regulations they have to follow. 
Being around Bitcoin for years I can say. There have been many like you who seem to think only third world countries are buyers. Many around the world are buying. That’s a good thing. If you don’t like it then oh well. Hold your peace of mind and don’t buy.

Not good. Because it's to easy to do fractional system. The coin on chain is btc. The exchanges will sell 1 ncoin for each btc. This will be the first pointer. Next 1 ncoin can turn into 2 ncoin by assigning the new coins to the first ncoin. Now you have 3 ncoins assigned to 1 btc. A primary and a secondary. The secondary coins won't have the right to the btc but will have the right to the primary coin. But they will all be ncoin. This is a dependent relationship which will require a third party.

OpenDimes have been around for awhile. Basically it’s a USB stick loaded with btc on it. You have to put the BTC on it. They go fast and can be sold counter top without any btc on it. This would allow you to take bitcoin without ever needing an ATM. Banks are not that friendly to ATM operators and it’s a cash business. So you could sell the OpenDime with a swipe of a card. Or take cash. Then when they purchase btc it’s a service charge to load it. If they want $500 worth of btc. Charge them $500 for the service. Then put that on the OpenDime.

If you don’t like it don’t buy it. It’s that simple. You can come here to vocalize what you rationalize but to no avail no one on this sub is going to care. They come here to find out and learn about bitcoin. Not alts. Not blockchain. Not fiat. You have generations of ppl who are learning about the world of what is money. Not some 20th century money. But money from all the way back to seashells. You sound more worried than making claims against bitcoin. Good! That means it’s working or else why come here

What it means is they are getting ready to stop a down turn. A recession by definition is 3 consecutive quarters of negative or lower GDP growth.  What’s the easiest way to increase GDP. Government spending. What’s the hardest way. Consumption. Of course they can go the investment route but that’s how bigger bubbles are created. We are effectively at a point where the government is crowding out the economy in true economic terms. 
And just so you know. There is no hyperinflation in a system that is measured in terms of debt. It’s hyperdebtflation.  That’s the point where it will never get paid back. Creating debt is creating money. So to each his own. 
What the central banks don’t know is. We all know this for the most part. We will buy bitcoin, gold, and silver. Anything that is physical.

I think this is getting too far down the rabbit hole. The last thing China would want to do is destroy a marketable asset that they nationalize. The Chinese miners who took a risk will just do things on the behalf of the communist party. It may work out better because you won't have any one individual who could maliciously attack the protocol either. It will be the same as they treat their gold reserves. 
If most don't know but Russia is going to be running a mining farm. This will be state sponsored. They will build there own equipment too. So what is the difference. 
 Really if Iran, North Korea, Russia, Syria, Venezuela, and China all started national mining farms would that hurt your feelings. Bitcoin is permission less. It's censorship resistant. It's sanction resistant. And no one controls it. They would still have to go by consensus. If not a chain split happens. Then you wind up with 16 million of the same coins owned by the same people you tried to split from.

Second the reason we don’t have several internets for different use cases is because it is layered. We don’t have a separate internet for video and data. Think about that. I think you are mixing the concept of uses as being separate from what we use for measurement of value. Money is a standard that forms the basis of what we perceive as value.

Here is what you need to understand about that time in history. Most people during that time didn't line up and turn over their gold. The gold was in the banks. Banks held the gold on deposit. And just like today most people had gold in the bank. So when it came time to seize the gold the process was easy. The gold certificates or fiat was still in circulation. But you couldn't use them to redeem them for gold. 
If you have Bitcoin in a bank like Coinbase the same thing can occur.

This is bs. They are creating a political system for votes vs consensus. My example for what consensus is. The internet has its own consensus mechanism. Most don’t or won’t recognize that. No me is voting  on how changes get made. Because if you want to participate you must stay within compatibility. 
As for bitcoin. Consensus is performed every 10 minutes. All transaction must be compatible to be included into a block. When it comes time to add newer consensus rules like segwit. We are not waging a debate about coming to a consensus on a new consensus. It’s just a way for active participants to inform the rest of us that changes are being made. If you just own bitcoin you are not a participant of the network consensus. You are just a user. If there is something you want then you are free to run a node with whatever code you want. If it’s not compatible then you won’t have Bitcoin peers. Bitcoin allows everyone to be a participant in the network. But not many do because the node count is not in the millions. 
Any other protocol/ project that believes bitcoin has a consensus issue is plainly misleading what consensus is. Bitcoin is not a democracy it’s software. So when chainsplit happen as they do. It is a few that wish to have a different consensus to follow.

This is so untrue. A SHA 256 chain is a SHA 256 chain. Miners are not competing between chains. They are decentralizing between chains. Where  the chains compete is at the user end. Let's stop making Bitcoin about miners. There is not a single capitalistic company in the world they will ever exist to make a profit without the end user. Oil companies need people to drive cars. Car manufacturers need people to buy cars. Grocery stores need people to come in and buy food. Bitcoin miners need people to buy Bitcoin. 
If not a single person finds value in your product or service guess what. They go out of business. Stop letting these charlatans think they control Bitcoin. Miners will be miners. What ever chain gives them a chance to make a buck. That's the chain they will mine. To them it really is not about which chain will win. And the ones that think this way have no clue or are just posturing. 
In the end users win. If the chain splits again someone on the market puts in a bid for the new chain then guess what. You get those coins too. Does it make sense for Bitcoin charlatans to do this. Not really but guess what there is no one to really stop them. All you need is some hashing power a few nodes, a few wallets, and an exchange that will list the coin.

This is always left out or never included but history has set a precedent. The one country that will suffer monumentally. The United States of America. It has the world reserve currency. It’s major export is USD. As bitcoin displaces it outside its borders the demand for USD will fall. First Nations will build a reserve in btc. Next they will use USD to buy goods from the US. As time passes all those USD will come back to the US. The US economy is really big so hyperinflation will not happen. But it will be very inflationary. And then they will have to deal with the debt. They will probably go the route Japan has done for decades and monetize it through the Fed. But the USD will not leave the Fed. It will be held as bank reserves just like they do now. So this won’t be an inflationary situation. But it will cause asset prices to increase just like they have now. The 1% not in the club will be on the forefront.

US banks deal with one currency. USD. But that is because of legal tender laws. Each nation state has a flag currency. And each flag currency is used as a medium of exchange. But they are also used as ways to control their populous. It might be better if you just learn first vs jumping into something you have no idea about. Which I can tell just by what you want me to agree with you on that does not fit into what this is about. A multiple coin world is not different than what we have today. How long was gold the basis of all value. Thousands of years. Why. Not banks. And now in this days of tech we have bitcoin which is digital gold.

I think we all realize at this point all rhetoric is political. It's plain and simple. There is no such thing as community support. Sure ppl will say I'm for Core or S2X. But the reality is consensus is based on what code you run. For wallets and businesses that are retail facing to think because x users use there services means x users support what software they run. There really is no proof. Users are flexible. 
I think most of the time when I hear the community supports this. I really wonder if the person really understands. There is no community.

Exactly. It was not just long ago that hodl mentality was king. Another thing I see is noobs don’t get it. You don’t buy once and expect to hit it big. You really have to commit to buy a fixed amount over a certain period of time. It’s called saving. If enough people think and do the same the price thing everybody watches will only go up. As long as there is steady buy pressure from millions of people it’s hard for bots and traders to do what they do. It doesn’t take much either from each person. 
Another factor is why buy alts. There is no reason to build a position in alts. When btc goes up alts go up. When btc goes down alts go down. That’s how the bits are trading this. So just buy a few alts then go back to steadily buying btc over fixed intervals. People are not going to buy if prices are low. Because they think prices will go lower. It’s all mentality and herd thinking. 
I’ve been doing this for longer than 90% of you. So believe me when I say this. If bots and traders know there is always a buyer or millions of buyers that will hodl no matter what. They will continue to front run you to see when will you stop buying. They know you won’t sell. It takes discipline. The cat is out of the bag now. Take the opportunity of this life changing tech called bitcoin. If you own more than .25 at this moment then you can still achieve owning 1. And remember there are only 21 million of them. No matter what traders and not want to do in the market you can make the price of bitcoin be whatever you want.

Central banks and commercial bank launching their own coin is what we had yesterday. Something like the euro is close but they have a central authority.

In my area I just tell businesses to get with the program. Offer to take bitcoin as a payment, but put skin in the game. Hodlers are not going to spend unless the reward is worth it. And anything under $100k is not worth it. 
It’s been over a year and those who did follow my advice have been greatly rewarded. This is the stage we are in. It’s not about spending. It’s about hodling and taking supply from the market. Companies like EBay generate tons of cash. If they use it properly and put 5% of that into btc the future payment system will become reality.  This goes to show no matter how great a product you have, pretty good money is hard to pry from people’s hand. 
Core and many others are building the infrastructure for them. This is at no cost to them. Users are deploying key parts globally too. Bankers are playing the market to get us to sell. They want a large supply too. But there is only 4.5 million coins left. Those will be distributed over the next 120 years. So the longer the businesses take to put skin in the game more people like me will buy right with them.

Blah blah blah. Let’s use the small business virtue signal. Maybe it’s better for small business because they don’t have to wait 21 days to collect the money they got for the goods and services they delivered. They may not need short term receivable loans to make payroll and buy supplies. Which directly affects the banks. 
So it’s ok if a company wants to avoid NY because of this bs regulation. It also cuts the banks off to in NY. The world will move on without them. The 49 other states will move on too. 
The citizens of NY should really question why their regulators are trying to capture something that prevents them from having access. 
Bitcoin is exposing all regulators for what they are. Misuse of authority and the unwillingness to allow people to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness. NY can’t deem it money when the rest of the country deems it a commodity. So clearly being licensed to regulate a currency excludes them when the Federal government deems it a commodity.

Better to say when you make a payment you are going to request to send to a specific address. From there the software will populate a path to you from them. That is LND. To see this you can try the test net where you connect to s client that is not connected to the network topology. If the routing was forward checks then your money would not find a path to deliver but would attempt to deliver. Vs looking at the endpoint and seeing it is not deliverable because it is not connected to a viable path. So no delivery is possible. I noticed this when I myself tried to send a payment Roa non connected node.

There is a reason the gold market is like it is. Gold is physical. Gold is not as easily transported as paper. Equating bitcoin pirtibility to gold for keeping them in a bank is very naive. 
When you have a bank app what are you really looking at. You are looking at numbers the bank says you have. When you are looking at a bitcoin wallet. What are you looking at. A balance that says you have that many btc. The experience is no different. 
As for storing private keys. That will be a learned and conditioned activity. Never underestimate the human ability to adapt. But you will here many say storing private keys is a pain. This idea is supported and shilled by those who want to store your private keys for you. 
In my opinion, if you have less than 1 btc. It’s best you control your keys always. I say this because most ppl don’t have $6300 in the bank either. Most ppl don’t even have $2000 saved. All of you who are buying btc today take advantage of it now. Dollar cost average and forget about what is going on in the market. Set a maximum amount you are going to save. Set a time limit on the time you are going to do this. Atleast 2 years. 
Don’t get too many wallets and then you will be able to manage your seed words better. But don’t rely on just one wallet. If the wallets you choose don’t fully support bitcoin move your coins away from them. The reason is begging them to add a new bitcoin feature is an up hill battle. Support bitcoin not business models.

Communism by definition is control of the means of production by the state. They didn't shutdown the mining. Why?  China has a significant amount of hashing inside the country. So as they do with gold by creating a reserve they can do with Bitcoin. And this is ok. Bitcoin is permission less. 
If this is the case, the 1800 coins generated everyday half will go to China. Atleast until some one steps in to dilute the mining market share. All of this creates more scarcity. Then prices to fiat goes up. 
The only issues with this comes from upgrade time. We have some upgrades (soft forks) that target more privacy. And not a single nation state with the exception of the Swiss and Panama would want that. 
Seriously I would not mind as long as the leaders of the country stay in there bounds. Stay within consensus and don't act malicious. The benefits to any nation that takes this route in my opinion is far better than the cost. And then every banker, hedge fund, equity manager, in the world will be caught on the wrong side. 
If these actions make China the richest country in the world I could care less. There is less than 5 million coins left. And if the US wants to ban china from Swift then they have a back up to use that no one controls.

I expressed point 4 on the basis of what a consensus driven HF is. But yes there will be a split. There will be confusion. That is the whole point. The whole point is to distract us from reality. 
As a hodler you will get coins on each chain. Miners will mine all sha-256 chains. They don't have to be this coin or that coin. If the signers of the NYA feel they want to go a different path then so be it. We as users will have a miner controlled chain. A business controlled chain. And a user controlled chain. And the future will tell which chain provides us the best benefit. And I can tell you. Businesses and miners are not limited to supporting only one. But miners and businesses can't call there chain Bitcoin. Bitcoin is peer to peer. It is not peer to miner or peer to business. Bitcoin is the users. It's value is based on users. You can have all the work in the world but if it has no utility to provide then it's worthless. If Coinbase and Bitpay get sued into bankruptcy that chain is worthless. If core devs just decide to leave guess what we are left with. Working code to build on. Better yet L2 solutions since malleability is fixed. So which risk are you willing to take? I know because of your comment.

Not really. The ETF is sized by the number of bitcoin that will exist. Here is what Wahl Street wants. They want futures and ETF’s to control the price of Bitcoin. The big problem is bitcoin unlike most securities and gold are owned outside of the financial system. So they can’t warehouse the supply and then set the price. They would have to buy large amounts that hodlers won’t give up. The other way for them to obtain large amounts would be to get them straight from the miner. The Chinese miner would never do that. Last they could mine themselves but there is less than 5 million coins left. They wouldn’t be able to mine them all. So the best solution for them is to just buy what they can driving the price higher till dollar parity.

Here's the part you don't understand. From a technical perspective Segwit was a compromise. I get tired of too many that don't understand the issues Bitcoin really has. P2P blockchains do not scale greatly at all. 
You can relay tx and blocks more efficiently in centralized systems. Imagine running a node that has 200k peers. That would be a very efficient setup. It's very centralized to. The 200k nodes only have to rely on one node for blocks. But that 1 node will also have to use 200k 1MB blocks for bandwidth every ten minutes. It will bear a higher cost to do this. So when you 2X the block size you will 2x the bandwidth. Thus increasing the cost of this one node.  So what does this node do to offset ever increasing cost. Nothing. It gets no block reward. 
Now the other model. 200k nodes but each node only has 10 peers and there is overlap to keep everyone synchronized. Well guess what. Now you just introduced propagation issues. This amount of time before all the nodes have the same information in the same time sequence. But you go off and increase the block size 2X. That effectively creates 2X load on propagating the blocks. At some point the last node will not be in synch. It will get block B before it sees block A. Then it's peers will ban it. This will cause centralization. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 01:12:31
You can do that but then your peers will ban you. And start thinking of a solution. We’ve been working on this for almost 10 years. Threats and attacks are thought up all the time. If you don’t understand peer to peer I suggest you do some research. The biggest attack vector which is hard to solve is the social attack. The only thing anyone can do is learn.

Shutting down the exchanges in China has been a positive in the past. It allows for a cool down. If something is not working then it's called for. Here is an example why they look to do this. 
Aug 1 we got Bcash. Just out of the blue it forked Bitcoin. Now say that you had to file with the PBOC and create disclosures to list on a Chinese exchange. Say that Chinese regulators required replay and wipe out protection for all HF. Whether they will cause a chainsplit or not. Say that a proposed fork required x days of testing and review. Add in they require a plan for the HF. 
If none of your proposal meets the requirement. Then you get no listing on an exchange in China. That user protection. Creating a barrier creates a safer crypto environment. 
This is global. My hope is as China has done in the past. Is to support crypto where crypto can't support itself. Even the US has stepped in on the ICO's. Israel is going this way. More countries will follow. 
I do not call for regulations but at some point there needs to be barriers and consequences for malicious actors. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 13:01:30
The dynamics we have are basically due to closed source software environments. It’s a boys club. Look at all the ICO’s and shitcoins as that example. SiliCON Valley has taken this as a call for them to take the lead. And everyone is paying the price. It’s a very high price for software that can be done at a fraction of the cost to investors. It’s a pump and dump. 
As for women in tech. I know quite a few. Many are focused on what we have today and not what we can have tomorrow. Even with encouragement or funding it persist. There is nothing wrong with that either. It’s their choice. That’s where the articles about this topic fail on all fronts. Women have a choice. But just paint the picture as tech has no women and it leaves out choice. Apparently journalist miss this point for a reason. And it rallies other women who aren’t in tech to say there is discrimination. Maybe in a concentrated culture like SiliCon Valley there is. So maybe if women want they can move to other locales and make an effort. Really the money will follow. 
But this conversation will never end till we just look at what it really is about. The reward. There is an incentive for each person to achieve the riches in tech. And we let a few barons decide the standards. Then outsiders like journalist come in and keeps the tone about a battle of sexes. It’s not. It’s about the tech. It’s always about the tech. Anyone can strike a keyboard and create software that has the mentality of creating something of use.

As long as they keep saying bitcoin I’m fine with it. Keep the word in the public. Once more get confidence then we will be doing better. This is short term. The US is taking the lead by what it is doing. Vs what China did. Exchanges globally should fit into the same context as modern day stock markets do. 
I say this because anything that gets us closer to allowing ppl to acquire bitcoin through a 401K is best.

You are part of the adoption too. Nothing stops any merchant from buying coins especially bitcoin. Once merchants decide to put skin in the game vs waiting for a tapped out consumer we can really move forward. Also you will need an exchange account to buy fiat to pay bills. This will also align your incentives better than thinking if no one gives you bitcoin it’s a failure. Less than 1% of the global population owns any. What will drive adoption is not a bitcoin accepted here sign. Consumers are not going to pay you as long as they hope for a $1 million coin. So the best thing to do is to buy with them. Use your cash flow to increase the amount you own. 
I say this again. Merchants DO NOT have to wait for consumers to buy with bitcoin. Merchants can buy bitcoin exactly the same way as consumers do.

I completely understand what you said. It is true. But for the purpose of defining what Bitcoin is has to fit into the context of what it’s use case is. Not what you want it to be for your usecase. It’s a commodity. It’s money. It’s data. It’s property. I’m not looking at what anyone rules it to be. It’s not different than someone calling ETH s security. Which it is because that’s how it was formulated at creation. Let’s not get stuck on it being just one thing. It will always be censorship resistant, borderless, permissionless no matter what a judge or statist says. Nor are these ruling diminishing these characteristics by any means. 
The real issue we have is external to bitcoin because it serves as the reserve currency for crypto. If an ICO is bad then it affects bitcoin to some extent. That’s the role.

Actually by the metric the oldest millenials are turning 35. So yes there seems many will qualify if you are driven by an educational credential. Next working for the government is a service to its people. As an American older than 18 you are definitely 10 years qualified. 
The one thing you don’t understand as the saying will always go. “You can’t teach an old dog new tricks”. But you can have a new dog come in to do the tricks and the old dog can watch. Which sums up the whole generational issue in my honest opinion. For some reason the older generations feel they created something’s so great that anyone should be able to do it. Yet these millenials just aren’t. There is a reason. The system wasn’t so great. 
I stand by my words. Unless millenials are being represented by regulators in an active role, it will never be effective regulations. Sometimes elders should bask in watching the future generations shape the future. Find any regulator that has 10 years experience in bitcoin and I’ll definitely call them a liar and a politician.

Because when the split happens Coinbase will hold those coins then decide when you get them. Just get a wallet that you control your keys. With Coinbase they control your keys.

Because it makes it easier to e rewrite history. Not just double spend but change history. In context back then it was 1 CPU. So the node was part of the computer. 
Now if a miner wants to 51% attack it's within the current block. Because if they try to roll back the chain external nodes would reject that. Or if they wanted to change the block reward they would have to hack and control 51% of the nodes. Nodes maintain the miners have to follow.

He gave you a great reason why No2X. My take will add because I feel the same way. The issue with increasing the blocksize is done. Blocks can be 1.8MB with Segwit. This is if you run a segwit node. If  not the blocnk will be 1MB without any witness data from segwit transactions. 
Another issue is none of these actors oppose the path of ETH scaling offchain. They encourage it. ETH has worse on chain scaling than Bitcoin. 
So basically you have actors who want to control the goose that lays the golden egg or they will kill the goose if they can't control it. We are in there way. They are in our way of weening the world off of fiat. 
I will be honest with you so you understand where I come from. Bitcoin is not controlled by those with voices. It's controlled by people who have no voice. You patronize whatever service that suits your needs. Just download the app and move your coins to that wallet. It's a technical leap. Any company that acts to represent you actually wants to control you. Core writes code for Bitcoin but doesn't represent us. They care less if we run there code. Basically they are tool makers. You decide what tool. Most of us run Core code not because we like them. We run Core code because it's the best tool for the job. 
I don't care if you or others support btc1. I won't and it's from a technical and ethical reasons. I'm a for the greater good. Altruistic. The reason why you see these forks in Bitcoin is because that's how this system vets everyone of us. It gives an incentive for malicious actors to react irrational. And once that happens it leads to a slope of no hope for them. Without any governance the system is left to be self healing. That what hurts those who want a governance layer wrapped around a consensus mechanism. They want words and agreements to be more worthy of running code. It seems messy but it's not. Bitcoin fails at many things we take for granted. But that is its success. There is no bailouts when you take people out of the consensus. Just run code and be on your way. Even a simple calculator will never lie or manipulate you. 1+1=2 always.

Sorry I made a statement and didn’t counter it. Yes it is true that a concentration of has is to the detriment of bitcoin. But it isn’t the only factor to determine this detriment. It’s an input to game theory. You have to consider intent. If the intent is to act maliciously then the incentives are there for them to follow the rules. As the rules are being followed the protocol can persist under a degraded condition. Which bitcoin is under today. 
But as we recognize this. We also have to recognize how not to expand this condition. It will take efforts of all bitcoiners to get through this. Market forces to encourage new chip and equipment manufacturers. Discussions, training and awareness to get more people to run nodes. Developers who will write code for the best interest of bitcoin.

And there is away to prove them all wrong. But you will think I'm crazy. Time is very short. Satoshi figured out the double spend. This is the first solution. The second solution has yet to come. Mass adoption and how to achieve it. 
How did the dollar prove its worth. It's staying power. How did they get the masses to adopt it. They pegged a dollar to a fixed amount of gold. The gold standard. Once other countries realized you could get a standard amounts of dollars for an ounce of gold changed everything. The US had a lot of gold by those standards. So no one doubted them not making good on it's promise. 
Then the 70's came. And the dollar had lost half its purchasing power. Countries were now back to demanding gold. The US couldn't meet that. So they came up with a different strategy. Meet with the oil producers in the world and have them agree to sell oil only in dollars (USD). As you can tell the dollar has always tied itself to something real. Now the dollar is tied to debt. The promise I'll pay you back with interest. Plus all oil sold in USD. These are all social constructs. Value created out of thin air. 
The second solution is easy in my mind. It really involves no governments, central banks, or billionaires. We have a big enough network. We are global. Instead of trying to bid up the price of one btc. Let's bid up the price of 100 Satoshi's. Ideally saying 100 satoshis for $1 would not be extreme but would cause near term protocol disruptions. The fee market would prevent many from leaving the exchange. But with LN it is achievable because the fee structure could be free to use or 1 Satoshi per tx. 
Why? Would I think this way. Because the masses in the world trust the dollar based on fictional pegs or faith. They have guns or can never run out because they can print more. So we use or markets to effectively peg Satoshis to the USD. At that point it becomes not a take over medium of exchange but a parallel medium of exchange. 
Then people can truly decide what payment system they want to use. The Fed would not have to create any more dollars. 4.2 million btc will be created over the next 120 years. Plus the injection of btc into the global economy that is not tied to debt will help restructure and rebalance.

There is no model of diversifying beyond bitcoin. Think of it this way. You can own USD or Euro. Better yet you can own Yen. That sounds diversified. Throw in a few stocks and bonds too. Now you are really diversified. You know what you are investing in. Someone else’s obligation. What do they owe you. Trust, faith or anything else that has no substance. This is what they want you to believe. They create a model based on this belief system. The world is filled with systems of trust. And those in charge of this trust system will do anything to keep you from being in a trustless environment. Because in those environments they have no control. 
What Satoshi started is based on a trustless environment. 99% of all crypto is based on trust. Sure they are crypto but someone has a level of control over each one except Bitcoin. And as I said the ones who instill trust will do anything to keep you from being within a trustless system. Diversifying is just one tacit they use.

You know I’ve thought about this for awhile. Let’s look at the perspective of its use. Bitcoin is a commodity. The very fact you can mine it is proof. In this case it’s no different than gold or oil. Next you have to see it for its use. Can you buy something with it. Yes. So this also makes it money. There is nothing wrong with that either. Last it is property. When you own some it comes with a guaranteed ownership via private keys. It is also data. Because messages can be sent from one to another. No different than email. 
These are the properties it exhibit for the real world. None of these can be held as singular. I think anyone who goes against these apparently has an issue with the regulatory agency that oversees bitcoin for its different use cases. 
We are in a world now where digital can be more than one. It’s very interesting times to say the least. Arguing over what one person says it is is irrelevant. Just participate and think of the future we can make.

The problems with physical commodity money was always debasement. When they stamped a physical unit on each to represent a fiat value. A $20 gold coin for example. Over time as the $ devalues the metal content has to be less. 
With Bitcoin I speculate the process to be more a kin to a supply demand based valuation. Everything that matters in Bitcoin happens after the decimal point. And any policy needed will have to consider this. A lot of old policies will need to change. Fixed interest rates would be one thing. No longer will we need a market based rate mechanism. This can also be achieved by setting the sat/kb policy.  The fee market can act as a mechanism to spur growth or slow it down. 
But first Bitcoin needs one thing for it to be deterministic in policy making. Monetary saturation. This is the critical point where the necessity of using Bitcoin is not the alternative.  We have a long way to go. Given the historical factors generations will have to change. 12 to 18 years time frames.

I see many join to make more fiat. Then realize the pop was when they were sleep. Not many are good traders so that's why we hodl. Over time you start to see your purchasing power increase. That's the whole idea. To increase your purchasing power. You don't really need to know the idea behind the tech. But it is encouraged. The globe of people learning about money and monetary systems. That is taboo for many to think of outside of themselves. Also Bitcoin gives you the chance to participate in your own monetary fate. There is no central bank or authority to make decisions. This is not efficient but the point is not to be efficient. 
This debate is over a few people who just can't accept that Bitcoin is code. It's data. They want it to fit into the system that they are comfortable with. But Bitcoin demands you change because it won't change for you. Agreements and pacts just don't work. Trying to add governance is just an excuse from those who really aren't ready or trying to create rules out side of the code. It just won't happen.

Whether you like it or not it's not your choice to decide. But it also restores the consensus to its intent. Nodes. Nodes enforce the rules of the chain. So now if a miner wants to mine that chain then they have to meet the chain consensus determined by the nodes. No need for them to be the determining factor any more or have any real say. If they don't like the rules then don't mine it. The same thing applies to these businesses. If they don't want to support a specific rule set by the nodes, then don't offer a service or product for that coin. In the end, the users will determine there economic viability.

Consensus is not voting. Bitcoins mechanism for this was BIP 9. But that won't be used again because it's not a vote. Miners are to signal readiness and that's it. Miners do one thing in Bitcoin. They process transactions and put in blocks. Then nodes can accept or reject those blocks depending on if they follow the rules. After 100 blocks the miners get paid for the block they processed if they didn't break the rules. That's how it works. Miners don't rule or vote.

I don't think a 51% attack is even feasible unless miners colluded together to do that. 
1. The network has 7 exahash of computational power. Without the chinese miners it would be 3.5 exahash
2. The attacker(s) would have to manufacture ASIC miner chips for this. Production of such chips is around 1 exahash a year. 
3. Next the attackers would have to pay for these miners to be built. So it would be around $1B for this each year. That's on the high side
4. Then you have facility build out and sourcing cheap electricity. All which cost millions of dollars. 
5. Once the operation is up and running then they get to double spend the coins within ten minutes. 
At the current market price that's $50k reward to double spend. 
6. Next once the non malicious miners find out they can immediately shut down to slow the chain down. 
7. The markets could halt all deposits. 
After all this do you really think it's worth it to do a 51% attack

 First you must understand what Bitcoin has a primary functions. It's to stay decentralized. Plus with the system structure design. It's peer to peer. Now listen as I say this because I'll be very clear. 
1. Within 10 minutes blocks have to propagate through the whole network. It's a global network. There is no centralized nodes to push blocks to 1000's of peers. Most node peers are below 20. So it takes time for all nodes to have the current block. The more you increase the size of the block the more time it takes for propagation. Remember you only have 10 minutes to work with. 
2. Nodes do not get compensated for the bandwidth and storage they use. If you have a data center who is really going to take on this debt. Using the internet is not free. How much does it cost varies throughout the world. It's ok for a miner to say let's just have bigger blocks. The protocol compensates them. Yet you don't see them running thousands of nodes. Why? Because it decreases there profit.   
3. Peer to peer systems. Most people have never participated in a peer to peer system. So they base their statements off what centralized systems do. If you have no experience with this type of system it's very easy to be misguided. 
4. Node limitations. Just like blocksize there is a maximum number of nodes that can stay in sync for any given block size. Too many nodes then blocks will not have enough time to be in all nodes. But this is not the issue. Because most who run a node pay for bandwidth. And when it cost too much they first reduce peers. Next they just go offline. 
I hope this helps you understand what this debate is not about. The debate is about who controls Bitcoin. Because if not there would  be no debate about scaling. Bitcoin needs a light client no matter what anyone thinks.

So is the off chain key acting as a pointer. And they ownership of the on chain key never moves. But the pointer will change ownership. That what it sounded like what he is saying. And if say 50 btc needs to be transferred to 3 people. You have 3 separate pointers. Each with a signed value for the directory block. Instead of having exchanges trade private keys to a coin they trade pointers.  If a private key does move from a block to another block the pointers off chain will still move with the on chain keys. 
So you could assign pointers to stolen coins that you own and trade them off chain without moving the on chain coins. I don't know any justification that would fall for that under kyc/ aml. If they are pointing to stolen coins you could easily trace the pointer to that coin. You don't need to know how much but who.

Looking under the hood is what is wrong with the crypto space. Op is what’s wrong with this space. I hear this stuff all the time. It’s le price so it’s bound to go up. And that is what makes it a good coin. And the concern troll of mainstream adoption. Only 3% of 7.5 billion people even own any crypto. Out of that 3% only 20% even know what they are buying. And we are not buying a coin. We are participating in a network. 
Bitcoin is a hard concept for many. There is no leadership. Making changes causes battles and it’s highly emotional. There is no other project like it. Not even ETH. If you really want to get rich my best advice is to do like millions are doing. Buy a small amount every month or on a schedule. And just keep doing it for years. Don’t look into the hype of this coin or that coin. You have thousands of people working on bitcoin. Not thousands of people promoting a coin. We are about the tech. When you watch YT about crypto and the person comes out talking about this coin or that coin I remind you. They are getting paid to do it. That’s why none of them have anything nice to say about bitcoin. This is especially ETH and the ICO’s. Premines buy you speakers of all likes. 
As a member of the class of 2012 there has never been a month I haven’t bought bitcoin. The highs and the lows. All the ones in between too. To me it’s not about $$$. It’s about how many btc or satoshi’s I have. And seeing I like my job I will continue to buy every month no matter what till I retire. And if I lose my job I’ll find another and continue. You need to have goals and a plan. Dreams of what you want your life to be in 10 years from now. Saving is easy when you get rid of the short sighted parts of your life. 
Having lived through the 90’s as a young adult I can tell you. Bitcoin is not going away and we have atleast 2 decades till we reach mass adoption like we now have with the internet. By that time 70% of the world will have btc in someway or fashion. Take part n it now. Learn not just about bitcoin, but about economics, finance, money. These are really big parts of your life. I wish you luck and whatever you are not buying I am.

 Gold bugs are good trolls. They have been trolling fiat for decades. Peter should tell people what they need to know about gold. That gold hodlings are heavily concentrated in government vaults. Banks and governments own and loan most of it to each other to cover bets they make when trust is lost. The normal person on the streets does not own gold and never will. The closer they will get to it is there wedding band. 
So $20K gold only benefits government and banks. That doesn't solve anything. That's why they control it's value. 
On the other hand, banks and government hold practically no Bitcoin at all. So it's the bad guy because the hodler is you and I. With less than 5 million coins left there is no possibility for governments and banks to own 90% of the supply of Bitcoin. If they did I bet we'd be using it right now. That's why at the critical point the value transfer away from governments and banks will happen. The largest transfer of wealth in all of history is brewing.

You know when we went from the 50 block reward to the 25 block reward a few miners decided to not follow. They basically lost money. And there are many reasons ppl care about Bitcoin. It's not just the fixed cap. I'd suggest you spend more time understanding what Bitcoin is.  If you don't understand there is not much more for me to explain.

Bitcoin won’t be stable till you get other manufacturers of ASIC’s. Which is coming next next. Then you have to have a price that will keep most millionaires from being able to buy one. Which will take a few more years. We need to let the dynamics play out. Getting rid of the middlemen is a step in the right direction. 
I watched this play out in shale oil. Hundreds of tiny oil companies refuse to stop drilling. Now OPEC is begging them to reduce drilling. I watched this play out in the election. California and New York could determine who is president if the system was based on popular vote. But the system is decentralized. All decentralized systems with the right incentives always prevail. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:58:50
No you don’t query all the nodes. It’s still a whisper network. I peer with one to peer with another. That’s how the path is found through peers. Once a match is set then that is the path. If one node drops off the path becomes null. But this happens in seconds. 
Known channels create known paths. 
As for scalability. I’m not for sure you can rely on how many transactions per seconds the protocol can have. Sort of like trying to count how many synapses that happen in a dendrite. If you have 1000 channels open and each channel makes a transaction at the same time you get 1000 transactions per second. There really is no limit except how much liquidity is needed to complete transaction pulses. 
This is all unicast which unlike centralized systems can have very high throughputs. It’s best to see how this will develop before concluding an outcome or passing judgements on its effectiveness. We know it works because they are using it on the main net right now. 
This is just the beginning. Also to note LN is not just a bitcoin thing. Other coins can work on it too as long as there devs work on making there coin compatible. Statist are going be in for a wake up if they really think trying to control Bitcoin is going to be enough. We have a good problem on our hands. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:57:06
I agree with most you say. But starting off by saying nodes don’t matter unless they have economic activity is very naive. They key to decentralization and having more nodes no matter how they play into the system is very important. This is way the attackers always want to downplay nodes. Nodes validate your transactions. Your node ensure the chain you follow goes by your rules. It doesn’t matter what anyone else thinks. When someone else says running a node is not important. This is the exact way of saying there is no reason to vote for the candidate of your choice. 
If enough nodes follow the same rule set they are in consensus. Miners are best paid to follow the chain with the most consensus. It takes 100 blocks for them to get paid. 
Businesses don’t need to run nodes. As a matter of fact most don’t. Even if you explain it to them what it is for. But most that I’ve consulted with have dropped middlemen and run nodes because they get more for less. 
So let’s explain to people why you are encouraged to run a node vs down playing it.

By what you described id tell you. If you are trying to increase the amount of fiat you have then you are doing it wrong. Sure Coinbase makes it easier. But really after you educate yourself you will find there are wallets out there that let you do exactly what Coinbase does. Buy Bitcoin through your bank account. Breadwallet does this. But the best is to sign up with Kraken, Gemini, or Gdax. Those are the ones that act as real exchanges. Coinbase is a broker. At the time of purchase you currently have to wait 7 days till you see a balance. Worst off is they don't let you have the private keys too. So you are trading security of your funds for convenience. 
It's best you get a trezor or a ledger first. Then buy a small amount of coins. What you can afford to lose? Then get acquainted with Bitcoin. Understand how securing your funds matters more than easy. 
Most here are not to stray you wrong. There is a wealth of information of what to do and what not to do. But no one is going to go through all the years to explain this. It's basically impossible because things change so much. 
And last don't be this guy and leave your coins on an exchange.

There only hope is for the chain to remain intact as one. Which it is not.

You can have more than one channel though. Use one channel to top off your wallet. Another channel to use to spend. BTW all exchanges are off chain. So in reality they can act as a funding source to your channel. Even some ATM’s will get into the game. So there will be several sources to find a channel. 
Businesses for the near to mid future will need an account at an exchange in order to get fiat to make payroll. Some of their suppliers may accept bitcoin too. So the deeper we get into the value chain the less the supply coming back to the market. 
Remember also many other solutions will be coming out. Not just LN. We have RSK.

This man lost billions of dollars of investor money on bets that Greece would recover. I don’t have anything against him but he is no visionary. He got lucky. Then lightning struck twice when he bought ETH. Actually he bought all the coins and most took off. 
I will admit. I myself am lucky too. No I’m not a visionary. I know more now than I knew in the past in Bitcoin. But most of these investor types including myself just got lucky. The closer to 2011 you are the more lucky you are.

As far as I know and take this lightly, the 2X side will have to force a 2MB block of non segwit txs. Then from there the segwit nodes with 4MB limit and non segwit nodes with 1MB limit will ban the block. If a btc1 node relays a block to those nodes it will get banned too. That's when the chain will split. 
The replay protection will be left for wallets and exchanges to implement if they want to keep users from losing funds. Most likely the exchanges won't list the coins and stop all transfers in and out of the exchanges. 
If you are a hodler then pretty much just sit and wait. Let things become clear. If you are a user and move coins then your activities could be at risk. 
Let's just hope after it some politician or Billionaire doesn't lose money and decide to take the matter to court. There is precedent of developers going to jail because they did something knowingly to break the law with code.

It's human nature to feel this way. I don't see why it's so easy for some to scream increase the blocksize then everyone falls in line. Then the blocksize is increased but people still want done what has already been done. It really comes from not understanding what has been done. 
The other issue I have is now we have segwit yet we don't have all services allowing this option for users to have. I guess they don't realize people will shift services the longer they wait. This is opt in. They need to offer it for users to opt in. They don't get a choice to opt the users out. 
As this example do you really think a HF won't be disruptive to users. Are we going to have to shutdown the network so the programmers can make changes test and review the code. Then start back up. Until these companies can come out to be proactive towards protocol changes before the fact there should be no debate. A month has gone by and still not even half of the Bitcoin companies have enabled segwit. And this was a SF. Imagine the results from a HF. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 01:15:53
What NYA signers want us to think is if all the miners go to S2X then users will follow. Bitcoin chain will be slow. It may not move. But this is fine. Most of us are hodlers. 
Next will be the market component. Miners will have to maintain a 1.01MB block for atleast 100 blocks for the split to go through. Every 10 minutes is a block. At Block 101 they get to spend the new coins. If the market prices 2X at $1000 then miners are doing it at a drastic loss. And seeing that the bitcoin chain barely moves they won’t be able to spend those coins either. 
Bitfinex has stated they will not respect the chain with the most hash. Bitcoin will be Bitcoin. 2X will be B2X. This will be this way till things settle. 
Bitfinex is placing a higher standard on 2X. And the reason is because 2X is not following there rules for being listed. They require strong replay protection. Most exchanges will follow what bitfinex is doing to protect themselves
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:31:41
We all are seeing the same thing. Some noobs just don't realize that doing replay protection on the code running takes a HF. So back to consensus mechanism just to add replay protection. How long will that take. 6 months to come to a consensus. By that time 2X is already running and hopefully failed. 
Funny thing is GBTC was looking to get listed on a real exchange. But it got rejected because of the potential of a HF chain split. So what does Barry do. Exactly what will keep his etf from being listed. He sabotaged all of those investors that wanted the etf listed. It carries almost a 50% premium. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 05:48:46
F2pool, slush, Bitfury will do. Then from there new miners will come. Price drives hash power. Investors set the price. 2X is not as great of an incentive when LN is a few months if not weeks away. 
Miners do not make money off of fees. The bulk comes from the block reward. The highest value chain will always have the most hash power. Always
Barry can have his BZC just like he has ETC.

What your missing is countries can't trust each other on a global scale. They never will. So you run into the same issue as nuclear weapons. It's an arms race. But instead of bombs it's money. It's the infrastructure. It's the decentralization. It's the anyone can join. 
I'm not talking about crypto currencies. I'm talking about Bitcoin. We have not foundations or alliances. We have thousands of nodes across the globe. We have a satellite system in the sky. We have global participation. We don't care who uses it. It's your money. 
What many fail to see is what we have. Too much focus on exchanges and the price. Run a node. Start a mining farm if you can. It's all open source opt in. You don't need permission. 
So why would a government want to control Bitcoin. Only those who want the power. But it's too late. This is global. Governments won't care about the coin. They can print money. What they care about are the nodes and mining. The infrastructure. 
If you want to trade internationally you have to use the dollar system. You have to comply with the US. They own the dollar system. All the partner banks run the system. It takes a pen to cut some one off. It requires trust. 
Bitcoin only requires consensus. Run code. Code is law. Once you have code in consensus it's hard to change.

Exactly this is what they are saying. Without strong two way replay protection when you withdraw your coins to a new wallet they can’t guarantee your coins will reach where you want. If you send BTC to a proven BTC wallet. You will also be sending S2X coins with it. Where they go is no clue. You lose them. You can’t dump them. They are gone. They will split the coins but it will be by the Garzik fix. Which means your 2X coins can not be used for LN on that chain if they ever get it.

As the big blockers say. Read the white paper. “The system is secure as long as honest nodes collectively control more cpu power than any cooperating group of attacker nodes” Satoshi Nakamoto page 1. 
“The incentive may help encourage nodes to stay honest” Satoshi Nakamoto page 4
“If a majority of CPU power is controlled by honest nodes, the honest chain will grow the fastest and outpace any competing chains.” Satoshi Nakamoto page 3
11. Calculations
We consider the scenario of an attacker trying to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent.
The race between the honest chain and an attacker chain can be characterized as a Binomial Random Walk. The success event is the honest chain being extended by one block, increasing its lead by +1, and the failure event is the attacker's chain being extended by one block, reducing the gap by -1.
The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit is analogous to a Gambler's Ruin problem. Suppose a gambler with unlimited credit starts at a deficit and plays potentially an infinite number of trials to try to reach breakeven. We can calculate the probability he ever reaches breakeven, or that an attacker ever catches up with the honest chain, as follows [8]:
p = probability an honest node finds the next block
q = probability the attacker finds the next block
qz = probability the attacker will ever catch up from z blocks behind Satoshi Nakamoto page 6
And so on. The system does not rely on trust when the majority is honest. The incentive structure is made to reward a malicious attack to follow the rules. These are the words from Satoshi. Whomever told you that self interest shit is part of the attack. 
When this was written nodes miners and wallets were all one. When mining pools came about miners had a few nodes and users had non mining nodes with a wallet. The valid chain is the chain with honesty. Once honesty is restored Bitcoin will be trustless again.

Look too many charlatans that want free rides. They need to be put in their place. Without replay protection you are passing off the responsibility of coin safety from the protocol developers to the exchanges and wallets. This creating unnecessary work. 
If I was an exchange or wallet I'd go to the NYA signers and have them agree. If a chainsplit occurs and users lose coins then it is the responsibility of those signers to handle. All legal actions taken will be their responsibility. Anytime and effort to mitigate the losses and adding the coin will be invoiced. 
Until exchanges and wallets start making protocol developers who want to chainsplit pay for the rights to their service. These types of actions are free. They could make them deposit some money in escrow. That's good faith.

There are no overlords. Even though some companies want to control it. But the system is fragmented. That’s the beauty of decentralization. No single point of failure. And no single point of authority. The money or btc you have is yours. If you have the private keys it’s under your control. 
What is the agenda? There is none. Just a peer to peer system that allows you to transact freely. I suggest you read the cypherpunks manifesto to get a little insight. But as money goes and how the internet goes. It will consume all money. Good money chases out bad money.

Who are you trying to preach too. You must not have any idea of what makes an investment or not. Probably can’t even read a balance sheet or read the foot notes. I’m not here to see fiat disappear. Never was. I don’t really care if it continues to exist. Wake up. To let you know it is not a matter of if. It’s a matter of when. Since the age of the internet it has consumed all. It will continue to consume all. And bitcoin is an extension of that. For something that doesn’t even register on the radar in the fiat world in terms of true economic effect they sure do have a lot to say about it. Why? Because they all know where this is going. Don’t let a swing down get you. It’s part of it. 
As for being the doom and gloom insurance I think you have been listening to gold bugs. I know. I used to be one. Everything about bitcoin is new. And sorry if the exchanges have no clue about what they are doing but they really thought they were going to replace Wahl Street. And Silicon Valley has been a cesspool of non innovation for over a decade. That’s why they got to sell ads and your data to make a buck. They have no fundamental product other than its users. 
Generational shifts happen. The boomers almost rejected every fundamental value that was handed to them. Now you have generations today that are not trying to pay for what they are leaving us. The bag. This problem is bigger than you or me. If you can’t see it won’t see it then there is no more I need to explain.

Breton woods was a failed system. They fixed the dollar to a set amount of gold. When the market rate was higher than the government rate is caused a run on gold. This happened because the US trusted the market to keep the fix. So they didn't have to defend the peg. When Nixon closed the window guess what happened to all those dollars in the world. They came home and created inflation. If Volcker didn't raise rates abruptly it would have led to massive inflation. 
If the US would have the the peg float everything would be ok. But statist will be statist.

Not that increasing the blocksize will actually help TPS. 8MB. blocks will not guarantee 24 TPS like they want to explain it. It may only yield 8 to 12 TPS. So growing the chain at 8X only to increase throughput but 2 to 3 x is not my ideal opinion of scaling.

No it won't. LN developers do not have to build anything for that chain. I explained that. Live with it. BCash has the option to have segwit. But there is no one going to develop it for them.

Just because it is approved makes no difference. I’ve seen this over and over again. The dot coms got SEC approval too. How many ETF’s got approved that no longer trade. SEC approval just means investors have a recourse in the event of fraud. It doesn’t mean the company or the security will succeed. Another issue is why would I want to buy this vs a REIT which can give me a dividend payout. You can’t just co opt Blockchain and think it is going to benefit anyone other than the issuer. 
You will see more of these in the future because the money flowing into this is massive. But really you are buying bags. And this goes to show no matter registration or not. All ICO’s are securities. And those who issue them are not taking any risk after they get your bitcoin. If the token fails you take the loss while they get to hodl bitcoin as it rises because it’s getting a greater network effect more than others.

I did. Here is an experiment for you. I’m here so you can learn. Send a LTC or BCH tx to a BTC address. The first node will reject. It doesn’t sit in the memepool waiting for a miner to reject it.

Accumulated worked chain. Huh! It's the valid chain with the most work. A non valid chain can have more work and still not be Bitcoin. It has to be valid. The other reasoning is the longest valid chain. The chain has to be valid once again. 
1X nodes will not accept blocks from miners that are larger than 1X. The nodes determine which blocks are valid. Any node that is +1X will be banned. So no matter what 1X nodes are the Bitcoin chain. 2X nodes won't ban 1X blocks because they are still under the limit. An invalid chain cannot make itself valid.

NYA only has 2 exchanges. The big players they are hoping on are Coinbase, Bitpay and Bitflyer. They serve retail. The exchanges set the price. 
Garzik is creating code to blacklist coins. Once that happens you can’t use LN. One of the reasons for Segwit was to enable LN. LN developers have stated they’d have to do the code over for that. That will take a year or two. Because it requires testing and code review. 
Now to these exchanges. They want strong replay protection. If they don’t get it then the possibility is they won’t list it. Even worse is the nuclear option. Shutting down all trading of btc. This means miners have lost the primary means to convert btc to fiat. How will they pay bills. 
When people are saying contentious this is what they mean. BTC1 can fork off cleanly. Then see in the future if people use that chain. It’s that simple. Letting peer to peer be opt in. But by the looks of it BTC1 is revenge code. It’s weaponized code. And you know why in the world we don’t use nuclear weapons. Because the other side who usually has more in their arsenal will strike back.

Investors priced in segwit. Now they have to price in LN. It doesn’t have to be massive in the beginning. But the network has to grow. By not adding proper 2 way replay protection they are attacking very big investors too. They don’t like the confusion. So by doing so those investors will get rid of that risk. Development risk is major with BTC1. And more whales side with Core because they have the reputation of execution. 
As for these companies losing money. That’s there problem. The system is not tailored for middlemen. I had a few stores in my area that used Bitpay. Once they learned how it works they left.

It's not the spurts of txs that prevent maximum through put. It's when then blocks are always full. Since 2012 I've noticed the network has a loading issue. The Fibre network has helped but once the memepool is always full the network load capacity goes down. It falls on the line of how txs and blocks are propagated. My node at home and my remote node do not sync txs and blocks at the same time. And for some reason even though my remote node has a slower connection it always has a block id before my home node. 
So really when you broadcast a tx or block from you node the time delay from you to the miners node is real. This is all topology.

This has nothing to do with the miners this time. The 2X types are using them. Just because Coinbase and Gemini day they will follow proof of work doesn’t mean miners will follow a dead chain. Mining at a loss is far worse than letting a chain die. Coinbase and Gemini don’t pay the electricity bill for miners. Users pay the electricity bill. 
What Coinbase wants is for us to sell our btc for ETH. By allowing users to dump Coinbase wants that 2 million coins that left. Sure they have 10 million users but the amount of coins between these users are small.

2. Segwit allows for max weight to be 4MB. 
3. Segwit is backwards compatible. This means you can upgrade at your own pace
4. Segwit2X means in Nov at x block everyone has to change to the new protocol. It's not opt in. It's opt out. 
5. HF are not decided by only miners and a few businesses. It takes every single node, miner, exchange, and wallet to decide. It's not democracy. I will repeat this. It's not democracy. 
6. If you are new to this hold your convictions. Don't choose a side until you know what a HF is. Until you understand how Bitcoin consensus is done. Or the lack of it.

This is completely false. What happened is Core used BIP 9 to propose Segwit. This gavebthe miners the ability to signal they are ready for segwit. It was not a vote. Most of the nodes updated. But I don’t think we will ever use BIP 9 again because miners would not do what in best interest for Bitcoin but instead hijacked it for a blocksize increase. What comes around goes around. Now a HF is not decided by just miners. Everyone who wants to HF to 2MB must run btc1. No one is running that code. 2X will split bitcoin again and now we are all figuring out how to dump 2X coins.

Bitmain has come out publically saying the arms race was over. Anything below 16 nm was a challenge for them to engineer. The new antminers coming out are still 16 nm. 
As for GMO coming out with 7 nm chips is a wait and see. But the Japanese are far more advanced at chip design and production than anyone in the world. So if they do come out with miners at that spec it will be a game changer. 
I read some stuff from a friend in Japan. The shelf space of 500 Ph/s miners will be 48m x 64m. They will be rack mounted not box enclosed. Which means with that type of foot print they could fit 1500 PH/s in a typical sized mining farm in China.

When you send it to the other wallet it will get mined into a block based on the fee priority. This will take between 5-10 minutes if for the first block. It could take longer if there is a lot of transactions waiting too. After your tx gets mined the other wallet is safe to spend those coins after a few confirmations. It will mainly be put into a block then after another block is placed on top of it it’s good to go.

But as for a user I will say Bread entered the rabbit hole with this 2X stuff. The right choice was exactly what was done during BCH. Now many have migrated because Bread chose to be political instead of standing up for a technical issue.

Do you know what the miners signed. Let me explain it to you. They signed to support 2X. They did not sign to leave btc. They can mine both. Viabtc said they will do this. Your dream of btc being killed off or frozen is a fantasy. Your argument is binary over something that is not binary. Do miner use hash to mine BCash. Yes they do. A SHA-256 chain is a SHA-256 chain. 
Also, once coins are on an exchange they don’t need a chain. They can trade as much as they want. I will. Or better yet. I’ll trade you btc for 2X. You give me btc I will give you 2X coins. Put up or shut up.

Businesses are all free to carry or support whatever coin they feel. Ultimately the users and those companies they go to will decide. Competition is good. BCash will have an advantage over other forks off of Bitcoin. But each fork will dilute the network effect of the forks. Do you think any company would first accept Bitcoin. Then move to BCash.

But you may have hubs that are truly just routers. They don’t care about the fee. No do they put nothing at stake. They just pass the payment on. For this there will be no fee. 
It would be awesome if the sender could make a payment but the amount is never disclosed till it reaches the end point. And if a hub in between wants to steal the funds they would have to know the amount.  The same as using the amount as a private key.

No what they want is to have LN capabilities. But LN devs are NO2X. Mike can’t follow what Adam says cause he doesn’t know what the code does. 
Here is the list of risk for 2X. 
1. 1X chain has over 80% of the exchange volume. Localbitcoins has shon they will dump coins for their users too. 
2. 2X is losing signatories. No one is being added. 
3. 1X is adding supporters
4. Miners can support the 2X chain but as Viabtc has stated they will support the 1X chain too. 
5. 2X development is not tested or under review. Not a single wallet will know what to expect. But wallets that don’t change to 2X May not work if the majority hash rate is on 2X. 
6. Some businesses in certain localities may face increased regulations because some users are politicians. Don’t think thy aren’t. I know one who will tell you bitcoin is bad but is in the 21 club. 
7. 2X won’t have access to the Fibre relay network. 
8. 2X won’t have access to the satélite network. 
9. 2X won’t have any further development improvements beyond what they can copy. 
10. 2X blocks will be rejected by nodes causing miners to lose lots of money. 
11. No one is buying that just because the NYA wants a blocksize increase that they have to follow. 
12. Last the 1X chain is not forking away. If we do nothing and btc1 forks off it’s because there code is not seen as valid. Anyone saying 1X can fork off has no idea that the one staying in the house is not getting kicked out. The one leaving is.

I’m not looking for a get rich quick either. And good background. Blockchain itself as you know is not the tech. That is just something some bankers came up with to confuse and divert the masses. The tech as you know, since you’ve been here since 2011 is all referenced in the white paper. Just like chemistry you take certain compounds and mix them up and get the finished product. Without one of those compounds you come up with something quite different. Please recognize that. Everything has its right time and place. Everything. So you maybe a cryptographer but that doesn’t qualify you to be all knowing of the complexities of Bitcoin. I’ve come to admit to myself that I don’t know either. Traders don’t know. But we can build on what we have discovered that works. And currently that’s Bitcoin. By diluting the limited resources like yourself to other projects if you contribute dilutes the effect of creating the internet of money.

BCH only has a few nodes. And most are located in close proximity. As for the margin of error there is none. All nodes must have block A before they get block B. If a node falls behind then it will basically drop off the network. 
What leads to this is by 2 things. 
1. Blocksize
2 node count. 
So if you limit blocksize you can add more nodes up to a certain point.

That is the narrative. Just like saying the only true measure to consensus is miners. You can’t fake a hash. 
But bitcoin is peer to peer. Which means user to user. It’s that simple. Businesses facilitate our activity. But they are not really needed. If Walmart accepted bitcoin does that mean they too have more say than you. No because if you don’t like Walmart you can go to another store. 
Here is an example of a recent event. Shapeshift didn’t offer segwit to its users. So Changelly announces it would. Where did the users go. Changelly. After a week of seeing Changelly volume activity Shapeshift comes out to announce they will add Segwit. You know why? Users are fragile. They are not loyal.  Why did Shapeshift respond slow. They had an excuse. Waiting on the next update. It was all bs and political.

I don’t see why ppl think this will centralize. The network can handle millions of transactions. Not the hubs.

There is no reason to try to kill this agreement. Just move your coins. You can write support to voice your opinion all you want. But the true statement will be moving your coins to a wallet that you control the keys. 
Coinbase will notify all its users whether they have any coins with them or not. Those who don't move their coins will be left with what ever policy Coinbase wants. It won't be there fault or fraud. 
Coinbase had the upper hand if you have coins with them. They control the keys. But many probably feel if they move there coins they won't get BCH coins. You will still get those coins.

Then they could use an existing infrastructure like online, mobile, ATMs to let you buy Btc.

The problems the gold standard was due to the government peg. It had nothing to do with gold. The US used a fixed price of dollars per ounce. And sometimes the market strayed away from this. This meant the US would have to remove vault gold to meet the market. But they never did this. Then the US took advantage of its duty and responsibility of maintaining this peg and printed more dollars than the peg allowed. So the day came where the market price for gold was higher than the US vault gold. Countries started to want to redeem the gold from the vault. That would have emptied the vault. So Nixon closed the window temporarily. But 46 years later the window is still closed. 
The gold standard would still exist if the US government wouldn’t have cheated. They got caught and this was a default. Inflation ensued after this happened.

Miners don’t oppose or support 2X. With a new chain they get to live the GPU life. Switching from chain to chain to make the most money. They can signal all they want. But this is better for us. Once this is over we can just do like Satoshi said. Update your nodes. Miners will follow nodes. Wallets will update nodes for BTC. 
If the other chains want to do something they can. Without us. This will also give the market a view of where the real innovation is coming from. BCash is a miner chain with no innovation and no off chain or side chains. Bizcoin is a clone of Btc with segwit but no devs for L2. As an investor the reality is clear. If you don’t have L2 then you are just a Blockchain and not a protocol. Protocols get built on.

The whole fork for B2X is a risk. That is the purpose. They are coercing the community to stay together and no one wants to deal with it. It’s a wait and see game. It will come down to the markets or exchanges to price in the split. Then the miners will follow suit. Or atleast I hope so. 
It really sucks for developers. BCash in August, BGold in October, S2X in November. Code for wallets just don’t write itself. These developers are getting battle tested as we speak in real time. Then us greedy users who want dump code at the drop of a dime. I guess we have to deal with it and live on. This is Bitcoin. Never perfect but always working.

I understand what OP wants to do. Many others want to take that path. Not many like LBC that will just dump for there users. 
As for CB, it’s an on ramp IMO. Most users that go to them are not technically inclined or capable. This is even with google. Or better yet they will fall prey to some scam on google offering the service for them. 
But many use CB for its ease of purchase. That’s how many in the world have evolved. So I don’t think or call it hand holding. It’s called customer service. 
As for the time and effort for this dumping endeavor just charge a fee. It doesn’t have to be extravagant or exorbitant. That is the reward for the service. That’s capitalism. And for those who want to do the legwork themselves that’s fine too. 
Lastly I do understand the burdens placed on many developers for these months. BCash, Segwit, BGold, S2X puts a lot on their plate. And that is just 4 months. It’s completely crazy. But until wallets, and exchanges make it costly for unwarranted actors it will continue. And saying we won’t support it just doesn’t cut it. Do a survey and find out what your users need then fill it.

This has nothing to do with Core. You’ve got 100K nodes out there. Only 200 run btc1. No one is buying this is an upgrade. And hash power has no say in what is valid. Nodes do. The chain with the most hash power does not define what bitcoin is. Sorry if you believe that way. But the truth is it’s a fool to believe that. When a miner broadcast a block. It takes 100 confirmations for them to get paid. It takes just one honest node to invalidate a block.

What you are seeing is as Wallets enable segwit people are converting to segwit addresses. That’s called migration. Adoption is a fallacy. People don’t adopt a technology. People migrate to it. The focus of this type of thought comes from a value construct. If the reward outweighs the debt people tend to step towards something new. 
What is this debt. Current consumption. People are adapted to spend now to meet there needs vs save for future rewards. Why is this. Because the system is designed that way. I have a point so bear with me. 
What is this reward. The reward in bitcoin is if I save a little today my savings will be worth more. Even if I don’t put anything away after that. It’s a mindset. 
The same thing applies to what you are saying. If I add more blockspace today we can add more people for tomorrow. But this added space becomes future debt. This is a burden to all nodes. So if I limit the blockspace today in the future I can add more capacity. As long as the savings reward along with the block space being limited people can tolerate the system. Think of this in centuries. Expand the timeline. 
Next I understand this relates to user experience. As I said users are fragile and can adapt as long as the future reward can justify it. To get to this adoption phase or as I call migration in masses you have to remove the future debt. This means going off chain. Off chain the debt placed on nodes becomes 1/1000x. 
Instead of putting more efforts into on chain scaling we should have 100’s of development teams building for LN. This is the consumer use case. It should be a tech race to see who is there first. We need millions of hubs to be ready. We need teams of people putting the word out. We need coders and accountants building back office solutions. We need exchanges for retail. On ramps that occur off chain. Anything and everything that remove the future debt placed on nodes. 
Miners don’t need to worry. Just do what the system was designed for. They get a block reward or subsidy. This is important. That is there incentive. Not fees for how many tx they can process. There will be a fee though. People need to be trained at this aspect. 
Let’s not look into the short term. The future is good as long as bitcoin survives another day. I posted a while ago about Bitmain. He created this trap. It’s greed driven. But the markets as they do can spur competition. And that is his fear. Higher prices brings competition. Newer chips coming out next year. Bitmain can’t make that leap to the new efficient chip. His success is destroying him. He wants bigger blocks because it will delay the going off chain. But it’s too late.

I don’t know electrum but if you can point your wallet to a 2X node then you can spend coins on that. Plus reliable devs and wallets will come out with a process to serve there users. 
This is what I see. Without proper and full 2 way replay protection in 2X is dead. The Lightning network was written to a specific spec. When 2X splits off they won’t have a Lightning network. Those devs are pro core. So 2X would have to copy that code. But they can’t because they don’t have the devs for it.

No that’s not a possibility. A 51% attack means the miner controls not only 51% of the hash rate but also control 51% of the nodes. They have to have both. And by the time a block propagates thru the chain from this miner they only have 10 minutes to double spend there money not yours. After that the other nodes will reject the miner blocks.

Good to understand your feelings. But what the community that did not sign this agreement is reaching for is replay protection from btc1. That's it. You never know. If that actually happened then more may support it. You are disregarding what the community wants by not doing so. If the members of the NYA can't handle this then community will never accept this proposal. I would never accept a proposal from Core for a HF without it. Even if 100% agreed to it. If Core proposed a HF it would be minimum to have strong replay protection. It's not a sign that it will become an alt coin. 
I don't want to hear that Core could put replay protection in for this. This is not you have to do what I do. The new proposal for this HF needs it added. And in the future all new HF proposal will need it regardless of community support. That's how you derisk an unknown. 
Your agreement appealed to the miners and not the community. Basically you fell for it. Why is the memepool not 60MB? Whatever happened drove up your cost. But after your agreement was done the memepool dropped off drastically. That is not a good sign. It means the protocol became weaponized to push an agenda. This agenda is still being pushed. So when you can decide it's better to proceed with the consensus of the community, we will not accept btc1. This is with or without replay protection. 
If you don't know there is a user driven campaign to stop using the services of any company that signed this agreement. That's the truth. Just tell Garzik to add strong replay protection and we can move forward. Don't expect Core to do it because they are not trying to change the protocol through a HF. And if Garzik can't produce that, you may need another developer who can. We run code. So we must trust the developer who writes it has our best interest. And if he doesn't then I guess you deal with that mistake. Because no majority of the community will run his code. And you can have all the hash power you want. Nodes will reject blocks and miners just won't get paid. The market will place value based on users not miners. It has always been that way. Why should Bitcoin be any different. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:26:05
Not how it works. All you will know is the destination. The in between will be done through the software to find a liquid path for you. Or you can do a path yourself but I don’t see that option happening. It appears to me when you make a payment it looks at point end and finds a path to you. Which means the routing can happen thru several channels as check sum at the endpoints. This is more effective than having single path point to point. And as payments become saturated channels will stay liquid because the points in between will be routing in different paths. 
So clearly Rick who is a politician is just wrong.

It will split the consensus. But there is more to it than just a split. The new coin may not be valuable. Also it will reveal a malicious miner. If you look at it from a game theory standpoint you’ll see that 58% of the nodes are daring a miner or pool to try it. So to you it maybe a bug. But systemically it’s a feature. And the competitiveness of mining means they would bear lots of opportunity cost to mine a different chain.

I used to think the ETF was a dumb idea. It is still a dumb idea but it makes financial sense. The US has a very mature retirement and pension system. It’s all custodial. It’s all long term holdings too. So if a group who would normally give a portion of their pay to a retirement fund or a pension fund they would benefit more by those funds buying bitcoin just as if they were buying a stock. Will those funds ever let ppl redeem the bitcoins. No! But that is not the point. But it does add something that is not associated with most investments. And the bar has to be very high on the custodians to prevent exit scams. 
Just consider it another use case for bitcoin. And if it does happen it will be new fiat coming into the system to buy more bitcoin and remove supply from the exchanges. And this fiat is in the billions per year that gets invested.

We do. Coins are only worth what we are willing to pay. Longest chain also means the most users. It’s our transactions that create the blocksize. It’s users who turn over there fiat to buy bitcoin. And if miners and few self righteous businesses think non mining nodes are not that important or useless than that is exactly why people will run nodes.

There is no risk of losing to the alts. Why would you think that. The ecosystem is diverse. Each carving out a niche. Having a world with just Bitcoin would really be a terrible thing. Basically delivering the statist exactly what they want. A world coin. 
We need alts as much as alts need us. Decentralized ecosystems with a few well developed and supported protocols. The adoption will come. I’ve been through it before. But Scaling and the explosive growth will not come from on chain. The second layer will improve everything. 
Here one thing you don’t see. Why are the signatures of the NYA so closely related to ETH. But you don’t hear them having any complaint on ETH scaling path. Not a word. They have all stormed Bitcoin. The whole idea is to stall. ETH Lightning network won’t be ready for atleast 18 months. These guys wanted 2X because it will delay people migrating off chain. Notice how many wallets have enabled Segwit yet. Not many. Why? Because it’s a stall. They complained about fees being too high yet can’t offer Segwit. Does that make sense! This is all posturing. 
Adoption. Many people buy coins and do nothing with them. They stay in a wallet collecting dust. Merchants aren’t taking btc unless it involves a middleman like Bitpay who will take on the risk. At 70B market cap bitcoin is not worth it to circulate. Hodlers want an incentives to spend. $4K is not enough. I think before the ball takes off the 21 club will have to be millionaire. This means $50k per coin. This won’t happen overnight but first the network needs to scale for real.

Nice try. The other exchanges have weighed in on this. It’s just Coinbase and Gemini that are saying this. The other exchanges have made it clear. Bitcoin will stay bitcoin. 2X will be traded as a new coin. Before you write something of this nature look and research the big picture. Coinbase is a small part of bitcoin. They are not Bitcoin. The majority of the community will not follow hashrate. Proof to that is NO2X blog. It has over 150 companies and meetups that will follow bitcoin not 2X. I wish you good luck on whatever coin you choose. But bitcoin is reaching consensus around NO2X. We are not making the miners to join. Just we pay more for our coin. And if they want more money then they can process our transactions.

So Core has to HF to add replay for a HF. Then everyone running the code has to change over to add this. Does that actually sound feasible. We have Segwit and not every node, wallet, exchange, or miner is running that code yet. But it's ok to just make everyone running code now stop what they are doing to add replay to what they are running. Is this what you believe needs to happen. If so it would take months before all participants running Core code to change to code with replay protection added.

Seeing government on average print 2-3T globally it may take a decade if the market gets somewhat aggressive. The tradeoff would be governments would have to own massive reserves to reach that. 16MM already exist. They'd have to really incentives hodlers to sell. Hodlers won't sell to central banks everything because they will seek protection from inflation. Central banks would need atleast 4.5 milllion btc to achieve control of monetary policy too. 
What I really don't understand is. The market is basically letting banks buy Btc at these prices. And bankers are not going to come out and say we are buying. But that Dimon dip was there entry. Foment the market buy the dip.

Let me explain this. Miners have no power. They do work for a reward. If they don’t follow the rules they get no reward. Nodes set the rules not miners. All it takes is 1 node out of 100 blocks for a miner to lose that reward. 
If 2X was so powerful than why are they disguising there nodes. Why are miners not running btc1 right now just waiting for the block. You can say this or say that about what you have no clue about. 
Consensus: You have over 150 companies and meetups all NO2X vs 40 NYA. Does those number look good. All major exchanges except Coinbase are NO2X. Most of Coinbase users are NO2X. So tell me again how hashpower plays into this. Kraken just cutout Bitpay. So where is Bitpay going to change btc to fiat at after Nov 1. 
Markets: They don’t care about block time. Exchanges are off chain. And since BCH we’ve had times where blocks were real slow. Did anyone switch. Did the price fall? At what point will you see that this will only scare noobs. And it’s working. 
Noobs: You look at things like hash power because you don’t know the tech. So you go by whatever someone you know or trust says. You think miners are in charge. You think Core is in charge. Here is the reality. You are in charge. You take your fiat and buy Btc. Without you bitcoin is worth nothing. No matter what the hash rate without you the coin is worth ZERO.

You run a full node so you can validate txs you receive. That is the main reason. The next one is so you can ensure the rules you follow are the same rules as your peers. That way you know they aren’t cheating you wen they report blocks to you. It also means that you enforce your agreed upon rules to the miners. They don’t get paid unless they follow your rules. In very large numbers it provides a high degree of security for the network. But it takes the many to become one. 
You run a node if you want to make sure the rules you want are followed. Same for the devs. If they want to change the rules you don’t have to run it. So all of the say is upon the ones who run nodes. 
Running vulnerable code is an individual decision. For me I see it as finding out which miner or pool is trying to cheat. They are bait. And seeing that no miner has exploited it means they know why ppl are doing this. It protects the good actors from the bad. Also you never know if everyone who runs the nodes know if new updated code is available. It’s a global network. And not everyone reads English. 
Everything for English bitcoin has to be translated to over 40 languages around the world. That happens very slowly.

You notice how all of these problems with bitcoin are not really problems with bitcoin. It’s people. Bitcoin works. It still works. 
Segwit was opt in. I hope OP understands that. If the wallet he uses for personal or clients doesn’t offer it move the coins to a wallet that does support it. You can’t dictate how they provide software. Bitcoin is not asking you to be loyal to companies. If this is an inconvenience then don’t blame it on bitcoin or force your wallet provider. Move your coins.
Multiple implementations. I really would advise against it for now. Bitcoin is too young. Maintaining compatibility is a pain and spurred this debate. 
Bitcoin relies on honesty. Satoshi put this into the white paper over and over. If more nodes are honest then the attacks will never it.

This saying about not running a node means you are not using bitcoin is false. Same applies to the opposite argument. Users have a choice. That’s what is good about this. I too recommend more users run nodes but that is their choice. I do. I run one to verify my transactions. Just like holding a wallet with paper bills in it. You can look inside and see your money. I don’t use it to protect the network or for some political code attempt. My primary use is to see my money. 
With pruning and blocks only it’s bearable for all. Or you can choose to have several peers. It’s all about having these options. For about $300 dollars is all it takes. Which for some maybe a lot. But it’s really worth it.

Bit 4 won't activate it unless they are running btc1. Miners and everyone else has to run btc1. If you run different code then the flag day block won't affect you. But those who really think a bit or a uacomment will do anything are trying to mislead. This is not a protocol upgrade. It's is a new protocol. 
The tradeoff. If 90% of miners follow the new chain and 20% of the user follow the miners then you have more supply of coins than you have fiat to convert. That drives prices down. And vice versa. If 10% of the miners follow the valid chain and 80% of the users follow them the price will increase. It's because you have more demand than supply. Inside the exchanges block times don't apply. They are done off chain.

I will explain this to you. Please understand this because it’s not like downloading a movie or playing a game on your phone or laptop. 
Bitcoin is a global peer to peer network. It has miners nodes, and wallets. That makes up the network. When a miner finds a block he sends that to a node. Then that node sends it to other nodes it peers with. This goes on and on till all nodes have that information. This is done globally. This is done with in 10 minutes. 
Now when you buy something. It goes from your wallet to the network and the other wallet. Once a node sees it. It goes to its peers. Then those peers sends it to other peers. All adding your tx to the memepool on the node. Once it gets to a miner then they can pick your tx to be in a block. This is propagation through the network. 
All this happens within a certain time frame. Block 1 has to come before block 2 and so on. The larger the blocks the those nodes at the end will fall out of sync. Once out of sync they will be banned. If the blocks get to big more nodes get banned. The more that are banned causes centralization. 
You want to have more nodes to prevent nation state take over. Same applies with miners. You want many mining pools all over the world. Big blocks leads to centralization because the time restraint and network structure of peer to peer.

None of the alts or ETH did. Then we may see another all time high and alts and ETH will be no where close. 
I don’t know how to stress to people get there coins away from any company that supports this. Or those wallets that do most accumulated work stuff. Clearly this is hostile and made to confuse users.

10 min is a sufficient amount of time for nodes to propagate blocks to all other nodes in a peer to peer fashion. When going below that time you can suffer from more centralization. Which means less nodes. And the point of bitcoin is to allow users the option to run a node. When you run a node you are a peer. Or better yet you are a user of bitcoin. Those who run clients software are not really users because they allow someone else to ensure the consensus rules are followed. They are trusting in someone else for their own transactions. So with regards to the speed of light 10 min is a consensus rule that enables decentralization to be maintained. If blocks get bigger then the time it takes to propagate blocks thru the network is further strained. It goes to say any network peer to peer has its limitations to stay peer to peer. 
It encouraging for ppl to run full nodes to ensure they are not being cheated and requires the minimum amount of trust. Trust is only within who writes the code. After that no other peer can say you are not following the rules. The code you run is the rules you wish to follow. And 10 mins is a rule. Smaller networks can go below that because they will have the advantage of not having very many nodes. But once bitcoin gets deeper into the global economy node count will rise and there is no reason to restrict a person from running a node by blocksize or time restraints. So run a node. Get your friends and family to run a node. It’s your network.

There is no future for ETH. All tokens launched from ETH don’t need ETH to exist. It was just a way to fund development. Once that is done it’s a stand alone token. 
To be honest what OP fails to see is no one really finds any value in ETH. That’s why Vitalik can do what he does unchallenged. On the other hand Bitcoin is always vulnerable to attack because it is valuable. And most attackers have a bias towards ETH or ETC. 
Yet us bitcoiners will do what we do. Dump those attackers coins. The alts pumped the price and they too will dump those coins to boost the alts. Not the price of ETH or ETC.

This is true. It's an automated system. Really should involve the least amount of human interactions as possible. And for this automated process the owners of the machines get rewarded. 
Also, the dev cabal is not forcing me to run their code. I choose to run what I do. I also choose in my manner to stay in consensus too.

Why not agree to what factions want? Because then we have to agree to what the US government wants. Next will be what the Chinese government wants. And then add in Russia, Japan, EU and whomever wants to use bitcoin as a tool to further there government agenda.

See how this will escalate. Do you want that? It sounds tin foil but we are working with money. New value in the world.

Let’s just put it this way. All hard forks should have strong two way replay protection. Even if everyone is agreeing to consensus. Why not? Safety and security should come first. 
This is rushed. At this point the wallets, nodes, and miners should all be running that code. The other implementations should be tested complete for compatibility. No one should be signaling. They should be running code waiting for that block to come. We should not be referring to the white paper or Satoshi’s vision to justify the upgrade. 
And for what you have stated, in my opinion btc1 and the NYA should not be the topic of discussion. Just acknowledge that and avoid the discussion over what they want. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:49:44
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:19:04
Signaling does not mean anything. I can use 1 miner to mine btc. Then have a miner to mine 2X. This is what pools can do. They don’t have to put all the hash rate to only one chain. They didn’t sign on to kill one chain either. Some pools have 10k miners. Do you really think they will use every single one on untested code. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:00:09
Miners will follow the chain that pays them the most. Just so you know here are your options. 
1. Btc1 with a 2MB block for non segwit tx. 3.6MB block with segwit tx. Transactions per second 10. 
2. Segwit with LN. 1MB block for non segwit tx. 1.8MB block with segwit transactions. Transactions per second with layer 2 scaling 1000 plus. 
So leaving out the miners and slow blocks what chain do you really think the traders will value most.

Yes it is. But it’s actually a word subversion. Make business nodes more important than others. They are not. They don’t need to even run nodes. Just have a wallet. But running one means they don’t have to trust. Anyone running their own node does not have to trust. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 23:41:58
Your approach to this is wrong. Yes there will be niche coins but they will fall into deeper privacy aspects. Not faster or for some special abstract usecase. We are talking about money and a medium of exchange. Think of it this way. If thousands of coins were to exist then that is far worse than the current fiat system. We would have to rely on some reserve coin system just to be at par with what fiat offers. Your multiple coin system is crypto going backwards not progressing beyond what fiat offers. 
Right now trade alts but don’t marry them. If you think LN is going to take time then just wait. It sounds to me that all you are doing is trading anyway. Which means you don’t really use alts. You are just speculating. Now is the time to jump into the tech. Just like the last down period we all jumped into the tech. And most of us found no reason to buy LTC. It was not an improvement. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:17:07
It’s not if they do this you do that. Move to another exchange. It’s that simple. Send them a message after you have left. Tell them the reason you left. No one has to persuade a business or exchange them do a sevice for you. Just move and as the numbers of those leaving start to add up. They will figure it out. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:02:27
How much hash power do you need once LN comes to play. And if 2X doesn’t get any developers for LN then they are stuck. You can’t make LN devs choose your chain. They don’t need the longest chain. They don’t need the most proof of work. And seeing once your coins are on LN you don’t need the main chain unless you think someone is trying to steal from you.  
Why did Garzik cancel that awful replay protection. Because LN devs said they would have to rewrite the code. From the split they will still have to modify the code for 2X to use. That will take months too. So 1X will have LN running and getting network effects while 2X will be waiting to hire devs to copy and paste LN. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:20:36
These ppl don’t understand how this works. They don’t understand what miners really do or what nodes do. They stick with what they can see. They don’t understand that miners don’t just switch. They have to remove code and install new code. This takes time when you have thousands of machines to do this on. They don’t understand this is exactly like BCH except the wipeout protection is not the same. What they don’t understand is there is a list of who signed this agreement. They should move there coins now to some wallet not on this list. They don’t understand that the list gets smaller from companies dropping out. If the code is so great then why are they dropping out.

Of all of your concerns I’m not worried in one bit. But it’s nice to know someone else has figured it out. But my interest in bitcoin is not due to fiat failures or the system failing. It’s the best money the world has ever seen. And we should be happy it is available for the masses but no because fiat doesn’t work. But because bitcoin offers humanity so much more in terms of benefits. 
All those points you have said is no different than what a gold bug would say. But I ask before bitcoin did you buy and own gold. If not why. Bitcoin is the progression of money and currency. Over time money and currency was replaced by other forms that were more limited and easy to transport and store. And if you look at it from that stand point you will see why an ETF makes sense. It’s all on a transparent ledger that is duplicated 1000’s of times by anyone who wants to store the data. I’m not advocating for the burn the world asset protection. I advocate for progress. Just like email was a progression in message delivery. Or how refrigeration improved and extended the lives of billions. It just so happens that the government with central banks have centralized money and currency. And they exert control to the detriment of the masses. Bitcoin restores freedom. 
So you don’t need fiat to fail for bitcoin to succeed. You need people who wish to have freedom. And when more come into this realm of freedom seeking its more powerful then playing on fear and calamity. Encourage people to buy as a way to save. And it doesn’t take much to be able to benefit from this multi decade of currency change over. And being born into this time many will benefit drastically.

You can’t guess at this stuff. Most coins belong to holders. So you have to spend the coins to get the Segwit ID. Next is the wallet issue. Not all of them have to upgrade to allow this. Nor were many prepared for this. I think an exchange has converted to Segwit. But that’s only one. They made a big deal out of nothing.  Core devs know what they are doing. Don’t believe the rest. They are not programmers. Just a bunch of suits who think they rule.

This is not politics. This is an attack. If you read the white paper a few times to catch a grasp. If you read what Satoshi said in bitcointalk you will understand. 
Consensus is built this way to protect Bitcoin. Its decentralized for a reason. You hear the words longest chain or most accumulative proof of work. You hear valid chains. But no one gets that the real meaning behind this is honesty. If everybody was honest changes would be easy. But most aren’t. They want control. They will tell you they want decentralized development. It’s rhetoric and lies. Core has a hundred or so of contributors. That is decentralized. Bu, XT, Classic,2X, BCH combined have maybe 20. So they have different names. But they are very centralized. 
Each of these teams have done one thing. They are not honest. Garzik is hiding nodes to look like cores. That is not honest. Garzik is not making splitting coins easy. That is not honest. NYA signed an agreement without regard to the community. That is not honest. Coinbase has kept peoples split coins. That is not honest. Bitmain put in an auto shutdown in miners sold and didn’t tell his customers. That is not honest. Roger came out and told Mt Gox traders it was solvent. Then it blew up. That is not honest. Barry was trying to sell ETC as ETH in an ETF. That is not honest. Bitpay told it customers it had to upgrade to segwit then directed them to btc1. That puts them into a hard fork to 2X. That is not honest. 
Bitcoin relies on honesty. If you don’t have that then the consensus structure is built to protect it from dishonesty.

Bitcoin is not meant to be a hedge against inflation. Just like by decree fiat broke away from gold. Now fiat is being replaced. This is the transformation period. These old world terms don’t apply. Don’t be the last one hodling the paper bag full of paper. Gold will always be a hedge against inflation. In the near term you are not going to see this play out but gold has some upside in the future. Bitcoin is new money. Some other alts will be new money. And once they take hold into the real economies inflation will set in. Remember inflation is increasing the money supply. And this new money will have no debt attached to it.

The system is not built around any tax code. Nor will it be a fit for any tax code. Coinbase will adopt a stock style 1099. But you can game that. Anytime you withdraw coins it’s a tax event. So if you buy at $4500. Then transfer out at $3600. You are at a loss. Even though you just transferred custody from your self to yourself. That is not a taxable event.

Just because it’s an alt of Bitcoin doesn’t mean whatever bitcoin gets Bizcoin gets. Then imagine the confusion in the market place. If Bizcoin wants to exist after the split they will need to take a different path from bitcoin development. Not just copy Bitcoin and tell everyone we are better.

It was not an agreement. That’s why. In Bitcoin there is no such things as agreements. Consensus is consensus. Devs write code.  Then if you want to run you do. If not don’t. If enough ppl run the code you get consensus. That’s it.

I'm not a core developer. The same thing was said about when LTC got segwit too. Then Charlie put up a bounty and no one came through. What Mark is doing is being an alarmist. The reality is the cost of a 51% attack on a segwit node is immense. There is only 1500 of them that a miner would have to penetrate and write over. 
Let me explain the 51% attack in better terms. Not only does the miner have to have 51% of the total hash rate. But the miner needs to control 51% of the nodes. After that they can write over blocks and propagate to peers they control. Doing this will extend the chain. That is the 51% attack Satoshi was talking about. Please remember back then miners and nodes were running on a PC or laptop. Now miners only have combined 5% of the nodes.

Look at the altcoins that are worth billions and only have 20 transactions a day. BCash has 100 a day yet they get a $5B market cap. Just dump the 2X coins and move on. 
One thing I learned in life. When you make an agreement with a group. When some in the group start dropping out you don’t have an agreement. Outside of the statements being made by the lead actors of this agreement the others are not loyal to it. The loyal ones are too deep into it to back out. 
Another reason is miners are not going to sell btc to keep the price where they can mine that chain. The businesses will have to do that. And most of these businesses don’t have the capital to do that. The alt coiners have shown they will buy Btc just to get the forked coin to dump. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:59:20
Sure if they had 80%. Last I saw was miners moving away from Jihan controlled pools. And it’s going to be a sad day when there is no one to buy those coins they have for sale.

Crack open the code. Taken over by devs. All this is hogwash. Listen clearly! All those who do run nodes makes sure they know what type of code they are running. Lots of feedback on git. And at the point where any development team tries to tell nodes what software to run is doomed. This has been proven over and over. Roger has an issue. All the code he supported no one else did. He is a sore loser. He lies a lot too. He does not know that much about bitcoin. He got lucky. I did too though and I’m not afraid to admit it. But I’m not going to throw around my weight to get what I want. Roger tried to buy consensus. That does not work. He is not a libertarian or a voluntarist. He just another socialist trying to blend in. 
Making changes to the code and getting ppl to run that code has an 80% failure rate. Core knows this. Future development teams better understand it too. We have segwit is good. All the future changes are not guaranteed to ever get consensus. Even if Core writes it.

No one wants to compete in a healthy way. Too many want their coin to be the bitcoin replacement. And they go at lengths to create narratives about what bitcoin is not. You’ve been around and don’t see it. I find it hard to even do bitcoin meet ups for the simple fact they are overtaken by altcoins and ppl who want to do ICO’s. And every single one of them have a hitch or gimmick but come out and say they will replace bitcoin. 
Last night out of 100 ppl at a meetup only 4 downloaded bitcoin wallets with segwit enabled. The rest were more interested in shitcoins and mainly ETH. One of them even asked the owner if he could accept ETH as payment because bitcoin is too slow and transactions cost too much. But the owner is a maximalist and announced he only takes bitcoin for payments. Then quite a few ppl said why because they are the same thing.

It is good news. They are going to put money into the economy to help build the roads and bridges bitcoin needs. The only thing Silicon Valley and Wahl Street type hedge funds care about is new shitcoins. And that goes to show you that rent seekers will always seek rent. Never ever creating any real value. Look at what big S. Korean exchanges are doing. Look at what big Japanese exchanges are doing. They are creating bridges to retail store fronts. They are getting coin awareness in the public vs just in an exchange. Then look at what big Chinese exchanges are doing. Just adding more shitcoins. Same thing as rent seeking. 
Sorry if you were expecting your favorite shitcoin to be listed for the pump. But you took that risk into something that probably has no network at all. It probably doesn’t have any code written.

The fundamental objection was staying in consensus. With multiple implements on a broadcast network it becomes very hard to do that. Then put it in an adverbial environment and you have a disaster brewing. It’s not just a matter of being compatible. 
Also, the best way to achieve a hardfork is for us to run the same implement. As you can see we have Segwit and still don’t have 100% of transactions as segwit tx’s. This stuff doesn’t just materialize over night. It takes time. I’m pretty sure nodes could hardfork. I’m pretty sure miners could too. But the rest of the ecosystem may have disruptions that could be severe.

It depends on how you apply the game theory. Privacy is always a human right. But under the conditions we have today and for the for seeable future an external third party watch dog maybe needed. This is under the assumption that most governments and associated parties are the ones committing the money laundering. Even may help banks because they are the ones who pay the massive fines while the perps walk free to do it again. Then instead of having KYC laws you can have a watch dog to analyze transactions that tie it to the very people who are commuting the crime. Mainly the people you elect. Remember I say privacy is a basic human right. But transparency for government oversight is also a right that citizens deserve too.

This is not true. He leads the fight to keep ETH from being classified a security. Bitcoin is already established in the US as a commodity. I’m not with Mark on this. ETH is a security. They raised funds. They did a huge premine. Now all efforts are to raise the price of the coin by changing the economics. They are willing to act no different than a central bank. And the reason ETH is what it is stems from a few individuals like Mark. Don’t be fooled. It’s greater fool theory playing out. And by OP changing the Title to bitcoin is trickery.

I don’t need you to change the reality of it. I have seen with my own eyes ETH in an ATM. I have seen with my own eyes an ETH supporter marketing ETH to a merchant as a means of payment. I have been to tons of meet ups to hear ETH is better than bitcoin because the payments are faster. Outside of the scope of the whitepaper is reality. If ppl have wallets with ETH they can transact with it to each other. And if one of them wants to go to fiat all the need is an exchange account. This applies to all shitcoins and tokens. All you need is a wallet and an exchange and presto its a currency. 
On a side note, if any listed regulated company on a stock market converted some of its shares to a token the same thing will apply. You may one day be able to buy a movie ticket with Facebookcoin or Googlecoin.

The IRS has stated it’s property. To our benefit that is a good thing. The part that is not justified is the IRS thinking just because you own bitcoin or any other crypto that taxes are due. Which is not the case. Like when moving your coins from an exchange to your personal wallet. The exchange may report it as a loss or a gain but it doesn’t apply because ownership never changed. 
You don’t need congress to pass a bill for something a government agency can act upon itself. At the current moment legislators and many regulators have become increasingly helpful for this transition. They really have no choice. If the IRS wants to become punitive towards Bitcoin be sure the heads of that agency will be replaced. This is because Bitcoin is global. And there is no reason for a government agency to push this out of our country to our detriment. Another country will accept it and many Americans rich and poor will be left behind.

Big issue is the ETF will only be eligible for Americans. Bitcoin is global and I don’t think anyone in Japan or S. Korea really cares about an ETF. Why would anyone in the world care about an ETF that they can not buy. So as far as I’m concerned it’s just a narrative.

It may seem that no one would buy it but you’d be surprised. If this came with LN support or an interface in the future it’s will be successful. It’s not the world that is making this difficult for you to advance. It’s you.

There is away to get rid of much of the speculation. It’s called using btc as a way to save. You can have debt. You can build an emergency fund. And you can also save $25 a week in btc. Get a few hundred million people to do that and it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. But buying 1 or 2 times and thinking you are going to hit a homerun. That won’t work. That is why we say don’t invest more than you are willing to lose. If you invest little amounts over a long period you will be better off. Then tell your friends to do the same thing. I’m pretty sure there is atleast 400 million ppl in this world that could sacrifice $25 a week.

This has nothing to do with “regulators”. It has everything to do with NY. If a business or a person has no presence in that state there is no reason for them to comply with their rules or questions. NY is the fianancial capital for fiat and they have been entitled to keep other states from competing. Now you have Bitcoin and crypto where they have no country wide influence. Other states are not looking to NY to set precedence because they know NY will always tilt the scales in their favor. Kraken has done the reasonable thing and not disrespected the states that allows it to operates in fair terms. 
NY does not care about consumer protection. This is all about regulatory capture and over stepping the sovereignty of 49 other states and the rest of the world.

Here is what I have to say about gold. It is highly centralized. Central banks, nation states, and large institutions own most of it. So it will only work in their favor to have a fiat backed by gold. And why will it have to be backed. Because we live in a digital world. Next, using gold will come with counter-party risk. And through the test of time these systems fail because of the counterparty. Then you have the redemption aspect. If you want to turn in your fiat for gold it probably won’t happen. This could happen with bitcoin too if the banks, nation states, and central banks ever get the majority supply.

This is not an election or a vote. They signal to say they are ready for an upgrade. BU is a vote but it's misguided because it requires a hard fork. The consensus BIP gave miners a quasi veto of sort but that is not the intention of the BIP. It's an upgrade to the protocol. Not a change in the rules that get enforced. BU is a rule set change and requires a HF. Then we start all over. Why? So we can have the same stall to get flexible transactions. Not very smart.

So why don't we let those who want segwit progress. Let them opt in. We have the nodes. Wallets are ready. Bitfury and a few others will run it. So we could be Segwit tx right now.

You can't just HF to say you want to HF. It does no benefit to anyone. Nor can you force Core to do something that's not in Bitcoins best interest or not follow there

There is a reason real wages haven’t kept up with inflation. It’s called Free Trade. Companies got to increase the labor pool and have chosen locations where cheaper labor is sought. It was sold to the public as a way to keep the cost of everything low. It did but those goods kept up with inflation. Some exceeded inflation. All the while wages stagnated. Seeing that Americans at that time were exceptional and was making above inflation it sounded like a good deal. And the gold bugs of that time were adamantly against it. They understood money. They still do. 
Inflation cumulative from 2000 till 2017 is 42%. For wages it’s 12%. That means anyone working through that period is 30% behind cumulative inflation. How can you save when your pay buys less year over year. And where did the money go. It went into the stock market. It went into making companies more profitable than ever.

The other issue with ICO’s is they want to tout decentralization. Which means community peeps have to run code. They are the ones who have to buy the hardware. The company launching the software is not doing that. ICO investors are buying software that does not exist. 
How do you fix this. Give them as little as possible. Make the team prove the project is worth more. Make them have the software available for anyone to see and run. If it’s just an idea then guess what. Give them nothing. Write code. Let others run code in a FOSS environment.

I do know that. There is a reason for it too. The ones who create all the inflation also own most of the gold. So they set the price of it. So they keep it on pace with inflation. It’s the central bank hedge. 
The last decade has been more of the last stretch for financializing of economies. It’s no different than those who want to tokenize everything. We have already done that for the last 3 decades. Everything is securitized right now. Including real estate. 
Now as for living within your means. How can a family of four do that after a decade of stagnant wages. House taxes go up. Insurance goes up. These take away any extra purchasing power the consumer has. But great the value of your house goes up. Why not just take out home equity. Well then you just pulled forward future consumption. For what a new refrigerator or a vacation to Disney World. 
If you are 65 yrs old and only have $1000 in savings you maybe ok. But if you are younger then you are one step closer to adding debt for emergencies. I’m being real and I’ve been fortunate for the things I’ve done. But the reality is a majority of the ppl are at fragile points in their lives for most of their lives. 
The cure is to change the money. Bitcoin is that chance. It’s not an investment. It’s your chance to escape from those who control it to control you. The more ppl who think the same way it eventually becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. So save in it.

There is a road map of sort from Core. There are other road maps out there too. But as far as I know or have really understood. The underlying issue is in the way the data is transmitted or propagated around the world. 
I used to be supportive of bigger blocks because it sounded so trivial. But after an data engineer in my hood explained to me about propagation I kind of understood what some at Core are talking about. 
Then I also realized most tx don't need to be stored forever. That's runs into the risk of privacy also. But until I see a definitive reason 2MB blocks are detrimental I will support it. I just don't feel or support having 2MB  right now as Segwit will do the same thing but fixes a lot of propagation issues.

I really don’t have any answers to any of this. I reckon it’s best to leave you to your own vices. Bitcoin is opt in.

If you look at the number of subscribers from this sub compared to the other you will see which side is more supported. If you look at the nodes count per implementation you will see which side has more support. If someone gave you a five gallon bucket of water would you complain about being thirsty. Basically fees are higher because demand for block space is limited to 1. More users creates this demand. Yet we have a five gallon bucket of water already. Just have to drink from it.
Now we have other five gallon buckets that have nothing inside. The thirsty ones like that a lot more. But they are still thirsty. And are standing in front of an empty bucket. Why? Because it's really not about what's in the bucket. It's the bucket.

Have you ever bought a wallet in a physical store. I mean truly there will be hundreds on display. Some cheap, some expensive. I’ve even seen some free and they are still on the shelf. Free ones still on the shelf. And all of them are basically from an open source design. Better yet look at Women’s purses. It’s even more competitive on that front. 
The issue with free bitcoin wallets is developers have all these ideas that can’t be done because you can’t capitalize on it because it’s open source. The reality is if you get people to pay for it the devs will try to dictate to users on what is good for them. Like offering shitcoins or doing an ICO. 
As for pricing, even at $0.99 you can still build a product. If a competitor comes out with a cheaper one then so be it. If you offer more value and support then no user will leave. Build a product that has pricing power is all I ask. Support the product that a user pays for. I’m serious if your wallet leads to the use of LN and includes features for a premium like in app purchases for coins I’d pay for that. Even if it involves open source software. Less than 1% of the planet can code which makes your skill a valuable resource
Great example are bitcoin ATM’s. Ppl pay 10% above spot just to use them. And the units around the world keep growing. They provide access to those who don’t want to deal with the exchanges. It sucks but if you want btc they are more accessible to more ppl at their own convenience.

The longer chain is not defined by hash rate. It's defined by users. You can't kill off a chain with less hash rate but more users. You can have 4,8 MB blocks all you want. If you don't have the user base to fill 1MB of that then you have a bigger block limit but no users to fill that space to the limit. 
Look at LTC. They have segwit and a blocksize that could be 2MB. Yet they don't have the user base to fill .5MB all day. So let's skip this and cut to the chase. The longer chain is defined by how many users it has. In the situation where the majority hash rate follows a chain that is not user supported those miners will have to decide to either follow the minority users chain or the one with all the users. The market itself is not going to value a chain with the most hash rate if it has no users. Bitcoin is not all about miners. It's about us. Peers! 
The economic majority can choose to follow the same too. But why support a chain that has nothing but miner hash and no one who wants that coin. Hash rate doesn't dictate to users which chain they should follow. 
If the other side of this debate wanted they could fork at anytime or just start with a new genesis block. Instead they are using a flaw in the BIP to confuse people of its intent. It's not a vote. It's opt in. Even the author of the BIP states it's being used for malicious intent.

In my opinion BIP 8 restores the value of BIP 9. It basically enforces miners signaling for readiness and not a vote. There is a difference. Segwit is backward compatible. That means if a miner doesn't like it for what ever reason they signal for it but but upgrade there code. That's it. Segwit is opt in. There should have never been a thresh hold for implementation and node enforcement. Just a date and a minimum hash requirement with the situation of most nodes are Segwit ready.

Supposed to be hardforked. You must have no clue how this works. How many full nodes ran SW2X code.  How many nodes that aged from Jan 01 to Nov 15 ever ran that code. 0. That means the 2X part never had consensus. Starting up new nodes to run consensus changing code does not mean you are getting consensus. You have to have the support of the old nodes. Miners can signal all they want. Nodes enforce the consensus. They reject blocks and transactions that do not meet the rules. Miners just order transactions in blocks to broadcast to the nodes. For that they get a reward for the work they do. If they do not follow the rules they get those blocks rejected. And that makes them lose the reward.

I pay $99 a month for my whole household based on a package that allows for 300GB of band width before they throttle. They throttle from 50MB/s to 15MB/s. So it still is unlimited. But out of the 300GB my node accounts for about 120GB. I could connect to less nodes but I haven't yet. So out of the $99 a month I account $40 for my node. If we get segwit or a HF I will lower the amount of nodes I relay to. Which will basically keep the same. 
Asa node operator the program is really flexible. You can relay or not. You can choose how many you want to relay to. So from a bandwidth stand point there is more than enough wiggle room so it won't be a burden to your quality of life. And then no one is really paying attention to us nodes and just making statements about my bandwidth. Segwit with a 2MB HF is a no brainer for my purposes. They reality is 8MB blocks by that. 
My biggest complaint over the whole debate when it comes to nodes is. If we are trying to reach the most people. We need to understand the world is not covered with the internet. Those we are trying to reach have no internet much less electricity. So let's be reasonable. Make Bitcoin $1M A COIN then bring internet to those who doesn't have it. Then they can enjoy Bitcoin too. We can't continue excluding ourselves trying to include them at all cost right now. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:01:17
They need segwit because of the bugs fixes. If you include a HF in the code for a predetermined date it leaves no choice to users at all. No code review at all. So basically segwit is a honeypot. The question is how big or what is the HF too.

Luke the community or I'll say myself feels we need both. This debate is not over who is right or wrong. But we don't want a hard fork that drops the block size from 1MB to 300kb and scales up. Bitcoin has a flaw. That flaw includes you. Sorry to say it that way. But Charlie who is a core supporter got results. That what the community expects out of devs and miners. Results. So till you can come to the conclusion users ( the community) wants both. Then one day we may UASF and then UAHF. Stop being an extremist and give us what we want. Because now it's to the point they are not challenging code. They are challenging you. And I don't want to hear about contention. You are the contention too. Stop playing with other people's money and politics.

Not much has changed. Are you kidding me. Bitcoin scaled on chain with segwit. That’s a big change. LN is working on building out its network. These are all on live net not test net.

@_date: 2017-05-17 04:04:16

And now he can fight Segwit on Bitcoin because he can make more from LTC. His competitors on Bitcoin don't mine LTC except F2pool. Don't forget it's about how much you can make too. The more he makes no matter what coin the more power he thinks he gets. And those miners listen to him because he makes the miners. He controls the supply. So he doesn't have to care what they believe. As long as he makes more. 
Pushing off anything that leads to layers makes more for him. UASF.

Ok but why not segwit right now. It's safe, reviewed and tested. And after that we can move forward. But asking me to wait for this to be reviewed and tested makes no sense when I have something that meets that requirement right now. It's running on altcoins right now.

Sure segwit with a 2MB HF is not really a problem as long as conditions are set to be realistic. And not just we will HF at this time frame. The same deal as LTC is ideal. That is a market demand based proposition. Everyone will know. When blocks are being consistently filled by 50% then we start the HF process. And seeing we will have two types of transactions the 50% threshold will only apply to segwit transactions and Segwit nodes. They are the ones really taking the burden of larger blocks. Old nodes are just being accommodated to.

It provides competition to on chain. But on chain will always be our best bet. It's the most secure. 
I just don't think the signal goal was realistic. Do I really think a HF will go smoothly. Never. Leave it to mankind and somehow we screw things up. But that is also how we learn. So I always expect one day we will have to HF. But hope we can push it off to the distant future. It's all about preparations. Not expectations.

What do you consider to be the underlying technology? That is the question everyone gets wrong. Understand that Satoshi used several technologies combined that didn't solve the problem. With this combination he created the technology we call Bitcoin. Blockchain is b money. Mining is hash cash. Keys are cryptology. 
You will never understand the white paper unless you understand the references. Bitcoin is the underlying technology. 
As for anyone talking or discussing Bitcoin or Blockchain they have no clue. They are just talking heads with money. They are getting airtime because they have money not because they understand. Even most of the developers of Blockchain do not understand Bitcoin. And please don't consider miners or pool operators as understand Bitcoin either. All they do is download the cryptoware.

In the current state once the price of btc comes down. With Segwit fees may come down but fees are directly affected by the price of btc in fiat terms. $5k Btc price means about 3.5x in fees in fiat terms. But 85 sat/byte is stil 85 Satoshi's.

We went from a risky contentious HF. To just a risky rushed HF. So on that lines we are moving closer too. I do not oppose a HF. But it's healthy that it is being considered. 
The path forward in my opinion involves Segwit. It involves a HF. That is a reality. Segwit is open source. So changing The Who is propose it from group to group is a good thing. One group may find the right solution. They will take credit on who saved Bitcoin. We will move on. It's just egos out to play.

Bitcoin is not a deflationary currency. It's not an inflationary currency either. In your example you are basing it on a fiat value. So each Apple to btc is treated as assets.  It the reality is Apple is the asset and btc is the medium of exchange. The Apple seller is not losing anything if they sell one Apple for 5 Satoshi's. One Satoshi is always one Satoshi. If the Apple seller is marking the price of the good in fiat. They will get less btc if the fiat price of btc goes up. But the amount of fiat they are getting in convertibility is the same. 
As for deflation and collapse. Bitcoin unlike all physical money is easily divisible and has a Principal of the most significant digit. 1 btc is the highest unit. Unlike fiat where the most significant digit is at the penny. Btc can be sub penny. So Bitcoin can use expansion of 0 to meet what the economy needs. It can increase in value or decrease in value. People are going to have to rethink what money is.

So why did we set the consensus level at 95%. Why did you not portray this as opt in when you know if miners signal 100% segwit only 30% will actually run the code. Why have we not spoken about a relative timeline or conditions for a hardfork. This ain't about politics. Bitcoin needs to meet the demands of its users. Those include those selfish miners too. 
Clearly it's too late to push just segwit. So when conditions change you change. Do you support a HARD FORK to 2MB if segwit is not enough this year.  100k tx in the meme pool always and growing week over week. You alone nullc can change this. Sorry to say that but the day you come out and say we need this HF sooner rather than later will change the tone.

Exactly that's how decentralization works. That's why there is no fear from a chain split. Bitcoin derives its value from us. Not miners. We are the ones who exchange fiat for btc. No one is forcing anyone to do this. 
Also if China wants Bitcoin because of the mining they have I hope they realize more than half of the coins in circulation are in the hands of entities outside of China. We will be a menace to every part of there system. Or they will have to pay up. I will only take gold or silver not fiat please.

You ever been divorced. The more you escalate the more the other side escalates. This is what is happening. It's to this point because being unreasonable leads to be more unreasonable. This cycle continues. You think LTC had this dragged out for years. No! Why? Because Charlie sat at the table and listened. He got what he wanted and they got what they wanted. And they're blocks are even full. After Segwit our blocks won't be full either. Then add LN is ready and all we need is a User interface for smart phone users and presto. Blocks may never get 50% full for a long time. Then we hard fork. 
But what we really need is to get segwit in the wild ASAP. So we can see the effect. Study it. Improve upon it. That makes a HF even better. It will gives us time. It wasn't too late for LTC. But BTC ran out. The faster we get to study SW in the wild the better a HF will be in the future. Never should we allow blocks to remain full for such a long duration. It actually makes us look bad from a professional perspective. Plus we have proven full blocks are not as bad. But let's not get in this situation again. It's stressful on us not the protocol.

ASICs are hated because of Bitmain. Bitmain has very uncompetitive practices. They sell used miners and pass them off as new. But as for Nvidia stepping into the market. I don’t think they will because they are still Blockchain not Bitcoin. Even though Bitmain made more revenue than they did. And there is a reason why Bitmain made more revenue. Bitmain mines the coins too. If I was AMD and NVidia I would produce an ASIC for bitcoin and just not say anything. They could build a coin supply and it would never dent other sources of revenue.

Really the problem is ISP's around the world tax us for bandwidth. Maybe Bitcoin should get big enough we can launch our own satellites and bandwidth won't be an issue anymore. 
As for the blocksize, you really think if Core just came out with a 2MB HF it wouldn't be the same thing. Blocksize has never been the issue. And you know that.

I don't care about the narrative of winners or losers. We all win. We are winning everyday that someone buys or uses Bitcoin. I'm just trying to get Bitcoin to be more inclusive. And politics is excluding many. 
Why do I have to wait for EC or nChain or live with the possibility that 2MB will not lead to another years long debate. LTC set a precedent and whether you like that it's the right move. Let's do segwit then set a conditional state as when a hard fork needs to be done. If blocks remain 75% full after segwit then HF to 2MB. That is not controversial. 
I don't know how old you are but the internet failed to scale too. It was the same debate. The internet has still failed to scale even though billions use it. It's a layered technology protocol. Those who wanted to scale the internet basically on chain said all the same things Bitcoin on chain scalers want. Yet we still haven't scaled the internet.

You can always write a proposal and submit it to github. As for the monetary policy. It is fine. The price is only volatile in fiat terms. 1BTC = 1BTC. Also, mass adoption won’t happen till the fiat price is large enough to be a widespread world currency. As for merchants, they can accept bitcoin in the current state. Or they could just do like we are and buy bitcoin with the profits they make. Either way it’s a win win. The goal is to get bitcoin.

This is not true. BCH is a fork. It changed its consensus code from Bitcoin. Your logic fits to exactly what Roger wants. I can run old code on my node and still sync to a segwit compatible node. I can relay blocks to that node to. I can’t do that with a BCash node. So as for what you are trying to say technically Bitcoin is only bitcoin. BCash or Bitcoin cash is not Bitcoin. There are many protocols with Bitcoin in there name and only one thinks they are the true one. It’s not hard to test. Just run old code and sync to a bitcoin network. 
But I completely understand that many of you don’t run a node so you are susceptible to these kinds of attacks. It’s a social attack. But the code does not care what you think is Bitcoin. It’s code. The next time anyone wants to dispute this. Just tell them to run old software from 2014 and see what protocol it will sync to. If you can’t do that then you should not be debating about which one is the real bitcoin. Because you don’t possess the ability to determine that.

Because nodes endorse the rules. If they stay decentralized attacks becomes useless. RPi's are cheap and you can couple with old hard drives. Everything they do will always lead to controlling nodes. Once that happens they are free to censor, monitor, or ban parts of the network at will. Back doors by Bitmain are not bugs. They are leverage.

You are too young to remember. The internet ( not the World Wide Web) had the same issue. The same debate raged on. Back in the 90's the internet was controlled by the ISP. Internet service provider. It was slow. I mean a 2 minute clip would take hours to download. Yet we did it. For a long time too. There were so many solutions to scale it. The debate separated families literally. 
Then came this thing called the World Wide Web. It was a layer on top of the internet. It was great. During the great scaling debate for the internet ISP's did everything to prevent www from happening for a long time. ISP's like miners enjoyed the fees. It was about control. But shortly after www came into our lives, ISP's became dinosaurs. Some still are today. 
As for Bitcoin we are dealing with the same situation. Yet you have people who actually think going from 1MB to xMB will actually scale Bitcoin it won't. It needs layers like LN (www). 
This is not a debate about scaling. It's about control. Some miners see themselves as those same dinosaur ISP's. Their business model depends on having as many people using the bitchain as possible. Even for coffee. But we went through this same thing 20 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:39:32

If all miners unify under segwit plus the nodes blocks can grow to 4MB. Why are they worrying about growing to 2 when they can get 4. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 05:03:18
Yes exactly. Smart money hasn't even started to arrive. They are waiting for the layers. That where the innovation will happen. The next Google and Facebook and amazons have yet to be born or are just getting started in a garage. 
Anybody that tells you that Bitcoin just has first mover advantage doesn't realize how in less than 10 years it became global. It's not just miners. The node network with relays encompass the globe. The computing power is 2x the computing power of all the supercomputers in the world and still growing. People constantly try to hack it 24 hours a day. Still never successful. It exchanges over $1.5B a day in value. We have a use case that functions. Money. And with all the tech that is has still no one knows how big it is. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:05:53
After 8 years storage is still to expensive. Ask an archive what it cost to store something forever. It may seem cheap today but in the long run it adds up. There will never be anyone who will be a data center with nothing but cost and no revenue. If they do it's because they will sell your information to monetize you. Or they could filter or censor your use for political leverage. 
That is the system we have today. Your data belongs to them. The more of you and the more of you data the more they make. You volunteer to use there platform. They own it once you give them anything. But having thousands of copies of your transaction data disincentives this behavior. But making it more expensive to have this feature will lead to consolidation.

They give us the freedom to choose the path of our money system you'll be surprised at what can happen.

Why even look at that. Miners were given a chance. Segwit is opt in. They could signal. Let it lock in and go back to business as usual. They have made it clear to us. They are not to be ever relied on again. We'll use a different consensus method from here on out.

The real problem with the ETF is it only caters to US participants. You can't buy the ETF if you live in Australia, China, Philippines,Russia, Japan, Nigeria, Angola, Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Peru Or any other part of the world. It does open up an avenue for a lot of money to pour in but Bitcoin needs to reach people. 
Plus the fact it also opens an avenue to obscure prices. ETF's somehow start to lead the underlying securities. So if the ETF tanks it takes out the good and the bad. But it's only for Bitcoin. 
Now having an ETF built of Bitcoin companies would be great. But as far as I know most are private or OTC. The fiat financial world just has a hard time dealing with Bitcoin. But regulators do find it ok for a 4x leveraged ETF full of derivatives of derivatives. They are trading vehicles to arb out anything at will. 
So let's just say we can create real capital incentives for many without Wahl Streets favored tool of manipulation.

I'll tell you why. Because the total available supply actually trading on the exchanges are less than 1 million btc. And once the supply of btc becomes less they will bid up the price. Then if it leaks a central bank is hodling the price will escalate. Central banks will never be able to buy all btc. Most are in the economy or being hedl.

This can be solved right now. No proposal. Segwit is ready. They can signal. Nothing else needs to be on the table till that happens. It's not you get segwit if we get this. That not concensus. If there code is merited by users then there should be no problem. But it's not. We have a process already formed. USE IT. Submit, test review present to us. 
Miners used a flaw or loop hole to take us here. Even the author of the BIP has seen the err of this. This agreement has proven one thing. It's segwit now. Anything after that is debatable.

We need multiples of this price to achieve greater decentralized mining. The same applies in the oil industry. If it weren't for $100 oil sustained for years the world would never have fracking at these prices. The market or exchanges need to realize being part of the solution is called for. We need more manufacturers. And seeing it's capital intensive the reward for the risk is still too low. Every aspect of Bitcoin will benefit from much higher btc prices. But status quo gives a few miners the benefit of higher fees. Demand is increasing yet the market is still focused on the alt coin distraction.

Let them try. Believing is one thing. Doing is another. I can't believe they are trying to redeploy segwit as a solution. The quickest way from A to B is a straight line. All the miners have to do is signal. Once segwit is locked in they will have some data to base a hard fork off of.

It will take a generation for the flippening to happen. Most boomers and some gen xers care nothing about commerce but about getting rich. Wealth extraction is the measure of success. They called it capitalism for too long. It's actually no different than mercantilism. Plus this has been aided by governments for decades too. And you can see this same thing happening in Bitcoin. Being measured by the amount you hodl. 
I've concluded the solution is to do two things. One make Bitcoin prices higher than even imaginable and let hodlers distribute it through business formulation. Or make it pretty worthless so people will tend to spend it. 
Both solutions have its cost though. First will be from a top down meritocracy of rich people dictating to those who are creating value. Those at the top will see themselves as accumulate more to have more. This can be solved through the tax code. And yes in this case redistribution would work. Only if the money captured isn't used for war or keeping your politician in place. But we could just create a redistribution algo to solve that. The second will create the incentive for the top to remove the cap and have ever increasing inflation. That is so they can increase there wealth. Which will lead to them once again using money to keep there politician in. Which can easily be replaced with an algo.

Not really. If investors see this as an expansion for capacity that will get filled then btc prices will go up. Which means fees will go up. $5k btc could see $2+ in fees. Imagine $100k btc.

People who are looking at market cap are missing the point. ETH has an increasing market cap towards Bitcoin. But ETH is not increasing economic share. It's just a trade. I see ETH as the base of the App Store. AAPL and goog could easily intergrate btc as the preferred payment. There you go. Bitcoin has Dapps. 
I was by a movie theatre that has a Bitcoin ATM. It had a line of 5 ppl waiting to use it. Now tell me does ETH have a line of anything outside of the exchanges and internet world. No. But Bitcoin does. The debate is one thing but many new users have no clue about it. Nor do they know the inner workings of it. They use it because stores are giving big discounts to use it as money. The Bitcoin ATM network grows month over month. That's a real physical presence in the world.

It amazes me how exchanges across the lobe can't get Bitcoin into there country to meet demand. The issue is they try to stay within a global price. Here is a hint.

Sure I think actually using segwit as a precedent for any future HF. We need to get the coordination right. Even though a part of me wants a hardfork first because the natural state of blocks should be full. But we can build out quicker with LN and the off chain stuff. Segwit plus 2MB seems reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:56:02
I agree. I want to see segwit in the wild. I want to see L2 things in the wild to. I want to see ext blocks in the wild. As long as they are ready, tested, and reviewed. Then when we can't stand it no more HF in the wild. There is one thing I can't and don't want to see. That's emergent consensus. We are trying emergent consensus right now. It's too chaotic. It's disorder. And ultimately that leads to less security. I've only seen emergent consensus in practice in nature. But nature does and will rely on evolution as a mechanism for survival. So reaching a consensus is not based on wants needs or desires. It's life or death.

Miners will follow whatever chain gives the the most money. Users don't have to follow what miners think it right for us. BIP 148 is the economic majority way of saying this is what our customers or users want from the feedback they get from us. Miners get a block reward. That reward is constant. But turning it into fiat isn't. So the chain with the highest fiat conversion wins. That chain will be the one with the most users. Miners don't make Bitcoin valuable. We do.

I don't care about his lifestyle beyond Bitcoin. It's his life. I'm pretty sure has acts accordingly for his family. I support what Luke is supporting. Moving Bitcoin forward. Nodes enforce the rules. 90% of the nodes Core or segwit. That sounds like consensus to me. All they need is a date to enforce. That's it. If miners lose money it is not my problem. They either follow or not. Chain splits will be caused by miners not by accident. I have no fear that those who act maliciously will continue to attack. 
This consensus method just proves anyone with money can just start a pool to cause havoc. It's not a safe method. It never will be when 50% don't care or are malicious. Sybil the nodes is just an excuse. The community supports segwit. Nodes support segwit. All we need is a date to enforce. That's it. That will be our independence date.

This is not about a central authority. Nor is it let's try everything first to see what will stick before segwit. Development is continuous and needs to be cautious.

Plus you will never pass a hard fork without node and community support. Even with a 75% thresh hold. Hard forks are not just miner signaling. Nodes are ready to enforce segwit. More segwit nodes deploy every month by users in their own homes not AWS. 
At some point you need to wake up. Support Bitcoin. If ext blocks gets tested and reviewed and works. Then it's a path for Bitcoin. But having to wait for it is not an option right now. If blocks are full now let's move forward. A simple increase to 2MB is not what we want. It just puts us back to the same thing in months. No reason to stall either waiting for code to be done. Research, test, and review is the standard now. Just like the rest of the world does. That's risk mitigation. 
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:12:24
This is semantics. If you read through the whole thread never are they talking about 1MB forever. So the reality is not whether it is 4 or 1.7. It's about what happens next after that. A hard fork will be needed. My overall thought and seeing what is happening is that transactions growth is outpacing blocksize. That's a good problem to have. But not fixing other issues because a few think just going from 1 to 2 is not going to help. But going from 1 to 2 and Segwit is needed. Being incremental is not an option for Bitcoin at the moment. 120k tx always in the meme pool is roughly 1.5MB all day long. 1.7 is not enough. 2MB is not enough either. And people migrating off chain will not happen overnight.

Here is the best answer you can get. This only applies to Coinbase users. Coinbase has stated at the end of each year they will send out 1099's. If you don't receive one then you don't file it. It sounds noble but really. 
Here is a scenario. You have 10 btc in Coinbase at a cost basis of $100. Now those coins have appreciated into $1k. You are obligated to pay taxes on the gains when Coinbase sends the form in. 
Alternative you have 20 btc in Coinbase. You transfer those into a breadwallet. You have a gain when you transfer those coins. Coinbase sends you a 1099 to report the gain. But you do not owe any taxes. You transferred from your self to your self. Change of ownership never happened. That you will have to file with the IRS. 
People need to understand this. The IRS does not care about who will be paying taxes. They care about who you are. If not they could just write in a rule and give to the exchanges and wallets of all US companies dealing with Bitcoin. Not just Coinbase. 
Your best bet is to buy at Coinbase, then transfer once they are in your wallet to another wallet only service. No risk of large capital gains. 
I like Coinbase as a service to buy Bitcoin. I do use them and have never had the experience most people complain about. But I do not leave my money with them ever. I Store my own keys. End of story.

I'm not trying to say I'm right. I really understand exactly what you mean. I just think it's wrong concept. My .20 fee I paid based on $2500 btc would be .05 at $500 btc. If the fee was based on a set percentage all would benefit. We are discriminating against small value tx. Plus it takes out the uncertainty of what is my fee. 
The trade off is still being abused but either way you can benefit lower value tx more. Or with LN you can still drop dust back into your wallet. If your off chain and close out the channel with a 100 Satoshi. What happens if the fee is 200.

Do not think into that context. Not as a scaling issue but a migration one. Man walked in the beginning. So riding an animal is not a layer 2 solution. Transportation involves how many calories we burn to get from one place to another. It's a transfer mechanism. Bitcoin is a transfer mechanism. Visa is a transfer mechanism. 
I'm not sure that all tx will be lower. It just depends on what the solution will be offering. You don't need to earmark to what the fee will be. It's about migration. It's cheaper to take a bus 500 miles than an airplane. Sometimes it's cheaper to drive. The fee depends on what you are trying to get to. Why take a plane for a road trip. You miss all stops in between. 
Let's differentiate between what the debate is and what Bitcoin is. Bitcoin migrates tx from one person to another. Blocksize is not Bitcoin. It's just a form of carrier mechanism. You can have many of these that all work together.

I don't think going back to that will have any purpose. I've seen this many times throughout my life. Especially with early stage manufacturing. 
First there is an expansion. Then competition kicks in to start a race to them bottom. Next you lose competitors and concentration forms. After a certain period the underlying fundamentals kick in and others enter the spectrum. This crushes concentration forces and becomes more free market again. Just a cycle.
  A big thing to watch is for gpu makers to actually make Asics. It's niche but if the price is right I'm pretty sure they will enter. You also always have Samsung. They create all things. They have a global network and infrastructure. So Bitmain will never be able to compete on cost to deliver. Samsung itself will never price its competitor out either. But let these legacy manufacturers come into play. You may get your wish. But it will be everyone uses asics.

So basically run the segwit code done by RSK and it comes with a HF on a timer. Run segwit by Core and in 12 months the network splits unless core HF with them.

@_date: 2017-05-07 20:38:17
You ask for compromise when there is one. This makes it clear you don't understand what is happening. Segwit is bigger blocks if you run a segwit node. But it's backward compatible not to exclude old nodes. Off all nodes were segwit nodes then blocks can be as big as 4MB. 4 is bigger than 2. 
I speculate if we include a 2MB HF they will continue. This is not about blocks. They want to have control of the protocol. No LN unless they get to create the rules for LN. No blocksize increases unless it benefits them with more of our money. Every layer of Bitcoin will be controlled by them. L2 solutions will get approved only by them. 
They are literally trying to set this up to be a company. The permission less, censorship resistance part all relies on decentralization. Do you not understand that.

@_date: 2017-07-24 05:52:31
First and foremost nice video. But you have talking points that are along the same lines of all those who want to hardfork to a bigger blocksize. Next, if you don't understand the code then there is no reason to state an opinion of influence. Bitcoin is code. Segwit increases the blocksize for Segwit nodes. It allows for more tx per block for 1MB nodes. That's in the code. Last if you want an unlimited blocksize you are welcome to creating that. Node storage requirements and bandwidth will be your burden. Not mine. 
Let's be honest, let the developers handle the protocol wisely. Let's not discount the efforts made by them to place Bitcoin where it is now. So ask yourself, "if I can write the code that suits my need would I."

You probably don't remember the time when bank cards had a minimum limit. $5. That's because the fee amount wasn't reasonable for the merchant. Basically it was spam.

It's weird, exciting, and frustrating all in the same context. And yes we have yet to break into the true barriers of resistance. The global financial cabal. Yet a cabal is trying to form into Bitcoin. That's the struggle. We have to disrupt ourselves first. This trustless nature of things is very challenging. It also has large gaps that statist take advantage of. The whole financial industrial types wanting to dictate code as a responsibility when they don't understand what the code really does is amazing. Then you have people like me whose real part is to live my life as normal as possible within a new paradigm of money. Bitcoin died in my heart atleast 12 times but I never sold. I kept buying wanting tomorrow to be better for my kids and my grandkids. I just came to the fact this is not about me anymore. It is not the riches. The level of discomfort in the US is astounding. And the current monetary system is to blame. You can't have constant inflation for decades. You can't just print money at will to distribute it the so few. There is no trickle down. We became financially repressed the day the gold window closed. Yet going back to a gold standard won't work. The depressors  own all the gold. So having to see the exact same type actors in Bitcoin is not something to keep quiet about. They ruined the money systematically and I refuse to let my children have to live with a system that only benefits the few. Let that be miners businesses or whomever. I gravitate towards those who stand by me. Who stands by users. I will stand by them too. Let the science prevail and be governed by forces of natural will. Not someone's balance sheet or power from I have more money than you so I matter more. I ask others to join because I want them to have a better future. In a nutshell I'm tired of 99% of the global population being repressed. To solve that you have to fix the money first.

No I and many respect your insight. But the clarity of what we see is the success of the protocol. But no one likes the fact the protocol is hi jacked by some statist who are clearly not aligned with the reality. This was not to be a vote. This was not about centralizing valuable resources such as mining. The community as I see it from various sites support segwit. Yet they have not been given the chance to opt in because you set the goal post on the ones who have no incentive other than monopolizing the protocol for their use. That's the miners. Not all but these changes need a stop gap consensus method deployed that doesn't rely on them. This is madness how they promote other implementations when Bitcoin is still young. They don't trust you and this is not a matter of trust. You yourself has just said this is not your decision but everything coming out from them involves you. Don't deny that. They have latched onto this. Come to terms with that. 
Now irregardless of what I speculate on is my speculation. But I do see two different viewpoints which will never merge. This is my money and others you are politicizing with. If a majority of the community wants a hard fork to makes us go forward with segwit then listen to that. And those who truthfully support segwit, also support a HF too because we want the best for all of us. Life is hard. Life is unpredictable. But everyday as a bitcoiner we can work together because we have a common goal. Bitcoin.

Ok you change the scale to fit your needs. I get it. The obsession of being a reserve currency is a fallacy to. The idea of it stopping war is a fallacy too. So when you look to the true nature of Bitcoin in this puzzle we call life it's simple but not. 
Separate yourself from what you live and experience today. The rules are set forth by laws governed by man. The reality money itself is a naturally occurring thing. It's the medium of exchange. Today we have a government that defines this medium. But it is commonly accepted as what you will take for one thing to another. That's why drug dealers can take laundry soap as payment. I will discuss the issues you have alluded to. These are my opinions. 
Reserve currency. It is a widely used medium of exchange for the purpose of trade between borders. It has changed throughout time as technology has progressed throughout time. For centuries it has been defined by whatever state super power had the largest army. This system replaced barter. It became a new technology. We still practice it today. 
War. For the test of time humans have been at war. In order to pay soldiers for their services they typically demanded to be paid. So as long as there is some form or fashion for a widely acceptable medium of exchange there will be war. The wars will resemble more like what happens in Africa. They will be conducted by personal interest and not only by the state. Can we stop war. That is the question. 
So as stated Bitcoin does not have to be a reserve currency. Just a currency that is not controlled by the state or individuals for its production.

That's not going to happen. And even if miners do mine BCash. Bitcoin will survive with Segwit. You can't force nodes and businesses and users to switch. As it was before BIP 9 was a mistake and will never be used again. If miners want a 8MB block then they have BCash. They can also setup those datacenter nodes too. 
Jihan paid for BCash to be developed and now he won't support it. What does that say. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:21:59
In my opinion it is not miner concentration. It is mining equipment monopoly. Bitmain had a monopoly. Which basically means if you want to buy a miner, you have to agree to Jihan's terms. 
Now enter Canaan. Then another. Then another. These asics don't last forever. Miners will in the future be able to choose which manufacturer they want to deal with. It will be competitive. And Jihan will no longer have the sway. 
He can call for decentralization of the development. But that's just a manipulation of the true issue. You need more manufacturers in the mining space. That will solve miners having to rely on Bitmain to supply them with Asics. Jihan knows this. His whole strategy is to keep the price of Bitcoin down as long as the market sees him as credible. Higher prices don't help Bitmain at all.

Bitcoin in the last few years served as a means to bank the unbanked. Now it's more of unbanking us all. There will be solution to reach out to smaller transaction users in the future. The fees are not high if you are sending large amounts. Best if you just save in btc till a solution comes for micro transactions. No reason to leave if the money increases in value while you wait.

Solo mining is over. There will come a time in the future where Bitmains reign will be over too. There is so much fiat in the world that the risk reward is high enough to gamble. Real industrial players are quiet. Imagine who has the lowest cost for electricity. That's where mining always will navigate too. I'm talking about electrical power producers. The higher the price of btc goes. The more attractive it will become to them. It's only a matter of time. My power producer pushes out electricity below .01 per kWh. Their cost. So imagine if they can serve the general public and mine at the same time. Boxes like bitfury' s pop up globally. No longer can you mine in a home or some center Bitmain has. Electrical power plants have the lowest cost structure. Mining will migrate to them in the long run.

Miners do not enforce it. Nodes do. BIP 91 nodes are enforcing this. They may be some mining nodes but miners only signal to lock in nodes to enforce the rule set. Not all 91 nodes are run by miners. 
This is how the subversion starts. You get people to think miners are enforcing the rules. It goes to show. With the small amount of nodes enforcing 91 how motivated miners are. 
Miners create blocks. Nodes reject blocks. Miners signal to tell nodes they will follow a rule set. Once you get consensus for that nodes will enforce those rules. Currently miners are following a rule set that is not being widely enforced by nodes. This is just an honor system.

Exactly. Investors like assets they can park their fiat at. Many hodlers worldwide want Bitcoin to scale. They don't use or trade often. So the solution to them has always been a combination of both. Just so happens they will be able to get it from 2 chains instead of one. 
This has come out of nowhere. But it's perfect just like BIP 91 and 148. Miners are the ones who have to decide. Users and hodlers get both. Miners either support it or not. If they do support it come Nov we can just say you have bchain. So no segwit2x. Bchain will still have the same user base but will need some infrastructure built out. If they reject it we can say you should have supported bchain. Either way it's a lose lose situation in game theory. Core would not deliver a HF but someone else did. It may seem reckless and unsound but it's a blocksize increase. That's what miners have wanted. Now they have it. 
I want these malicious miners to cringe as we users and hodlers support both chains. This is not about mining. Let them know that Bitcoin and the spinoff are not controlled by them.

 Forced huh. Segwit is opt in. There is no force. If most users go to segwit miners are not forced to follow. Miners are taking advantage of a BIP.

It's what it is because of drug dealers, prostitutes and hackers. Some dude bought pizza with it. Then another guy bought a car. Some people went to jail because of it. That's what made Bitcoin. Oh and the mysterious disappearance of Satoshi. That the makings of legends. Now we have some science to this to make it into global warming or climate change. You really think people care if it's 100 degrees outside or why. It's still damn hot. Same applies to this blocksize bs. Then add in the politicians you get the making of exactly what we have today in the fiat world. The only people in Bitcoin that has any say are the ones who have more money than all of us. A new cabal. If you find yourself offended by what I say I'm talking about you. I'm not some extremist nor a side chooser. I'm some random guy who post. Problem is there are millions of us random guys posting who have no choice but to take whatever devs or miners say. Nodes don't matter even after Satoshi just said please upgrade your nodes. That was consensus. Now we obsess over this white paper. We define things out of randomness. For what. Let's get real. Let's comes to a consensus. Start posting a date when we enforce segwit. 90% of the nodes have the code. We have upgraded already. But continuing letting this nonsense continue proves Bitcoin is not about us. It's about them.

Can we just get back to what this is about and stop beating around the bush. They are not voting. They are supposed to be signaling when they are ready. That's it. But now we have a pro core dev making it out to be a vote. That's exactly what they want. So now the flood gates open even more implementations to come about. Everyone wants to put there two cents in. 
So how do we end this. Get segwit moving. nullc I propose you write a BIP with conditions to do a 2MB HF after we get segwit. Make it reasonable enough to not be toxic. Something like blocks filled at 75% capacity minimum for a continuous 6 month duration. Miners have to upgrade to segwit. And the code will be reviewed and tested prior to that. And it needs to be done by you specifically or Blockstream. 
The reality is a small group of people have complete control over this progress and the level of unprofessionalism is astounding. Charlie put his neck on the line to prove there is away. Thanks Charlie. Now Blockstream and you have made this bed. But this is what we as a community are willing to do. Sleep in that same bed. We understand the longer they stall the longer you will put off a HF. This cycle will never end. Put your past behind you. 
No one cares about this blocksize till you made it an issue. We all want something off chain. And you are in between it happening. We don't really care about Bitmain ASICboost. We want to buy coffee. What does that have to do with us. This stuff is the preferred payment method for hackers. So we let the limited supply of coins be jacked by them. I'd rather them ransom $1MM in btc based off a $1MM coin vs a $1k coin. The supply is fixed you get it. 
You got teenagers buying this stuff. People are putting their retirement in this stuff. Venezuelans are using this to live off of and help with a revolution from a dictator. It's providing many small Chinese towns with a great source of income. There lives are improving. People are looking at Bitcoin with a hope for a better future. Not just being rich. 
Bitcoin is in reality is bigger than you. But you guys are making this about you. All we really need is for you guys to sit down and come up with conditions for a hardfork based on blocksize demand. Sign it and put it in the bitchain. Then they signal segwit and lock it in. It may take years befor we have to do it. But it gives everybody certainty and clarity. That's open source.

BIP 148 is a user enforcement through their nodes. It would orphan blocks if miners didn't signal for segwit. BIP 141. What that means is miners would lose the block reward for not following the rules set by nodes. BIP 91 did the same thing but on an accelerated time scale with a 80% threshold. Miners didn't like 148 because it showed the real structure of Bitcoin. Nodes enforce the rules miners follow the rules. So the miners threatened with a chain split. BIP 91 allowed them a good faith approach to exit. I hope this helps.

If your node does not run Segwit2X then there is no Segwit2X. Nodes enforce the rules.  It doesn't matter if miners want 20X. 
BIP 91 allows for miners to signal for Segwit only at a reduced thresh hold. Not for 2X. So you have to run that code. You can't just signal for it. Next at 80% any miner not signaling for bit 1 there blocks will be orphaned. But miners don't orphan blocks. Nodes do.  So basically there are no nodes to enforce that because a majority of the nodes are not running that code. So who will enforce it. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 14:52:06
BIP 141 is a reinforcement. Miners get a subsidy. For the work they do. Basically Satoshi welfare. So what these nodes are saying is signal segwit or lose your welfare. 
The same applies to BIP 191. 80% hashrate signals and those remaining or holding out get there blocks rejected. 
These methods remove the hostage taking by miners. Those miners who see this as a threat are the ones who will swim naked when the tide rolls out. Those miners who say chain split are the ones who have more to lose. 40% hashrate gets bricked because they are going against users. 
Nodes enforce rules. Miners follow rules. So at some point miners can demand to want control but the system has safeguards. The markets play a part also. Just like markets do they can take away this miners are in control. But by doing so you run the risk of alienating users. And then an alt coin will truly overtake Bitcoin. 
Understand the motives. Nodes are saying signal segwit or miners lose welfare. Or the market path where everybody will lose. Not just money but trust. For what a monopolistic miners. I don't think so. 
BIP 141 or BIP 91 will find who is taking welfare at the expense to the economy. From here on out I believe soft forks should have consequences for miners who don't act accordingly. Soft forks are opt in.

BCash only hope is really for exchanges not to accept it for a little while. The emotions will make it a volatile trade. 18 million holders have btc. 16.75 million btc. The volume from those selling will overwhelm those trying to buy. 
Exchanges accepting Bcash are not supporting it. They are enabling it to be dumped. Who in there right mind would sell btc with all the infrastructure in place. All the regulations in place. All the nodes in place. All the wallets in place. Do you see what I mean. This is not just about mining. 
If I was a miner supporting segwit2x. I would do anything to kill Bcash. Successful or not if users, nodes, and companies don't want to hard fork they can and will just tell miners to work the Bcash chain. We can make up every excuse in the book but the reality is Bcash is what big blockers like Ver and Jihan want. Why change Bitcoin when there is a viable asic chain for them to mine. Even if the price is low there will be no more excuses ever on what they think. 
If more users are like me in thinking we WANT LN. But it will also give us a big block chain to transact on. This is a compromise we want.

You are missing something. BIP 148 is an enforcement rule run by nodes to orphan blocks by miners not signaling for Segwit. If they are signaling for Segwit those blocks will be accepted. 100% of miners are signaling for Segwit. So as an enforcement any miner who doesn't signal will be rejected. This will not split the chain. You don't need miners to run BIP 148. You need them to signal BIP 141. 
BIP 91 added an extra step. Miners have to signal for it. Then at 80% any miner not signaling would be rejected. With only a few nodes to support it miners are on the honor system. But come Aug 1350 nodes will enforce UASF till segwit activates.

I was watching some YT clips today. In the comments they are telling folks that BCH will have LN and not BTC. It's really dishonest for this. I just can't wait till segwit locks in.

Segwit will activate in Aug. BCash will start in Aug. is that not the NYA. Just so happens in Bitcoin we just can't do it like we plan. Admit we still have no clue about what we are doing. But it still works. 
Users who want BCash in the future have less than 5 million coins left. And to get them they have to wait for over 100 years. If a user wants BCash now they will have to pay up. If a user wants BTC they will have to pay up too. I'm not in this to lose value. I'm not at war over a parameter. Nor do I think it's either or. It's both. 
The value added after 2017 between BTC and BCH should be massive. Visa and MasterCard! BCash will have no malleability fix and that is fine. That just means any innovation that requires it to make the experience better just won't build on top of it. If they want to merge mine or extension blocks they still have to deal with us. If miners want to 2x segwit we can just tell them BCash is a blocksize increase they want. They can mine that. That is all I'm saying. Let Core handle a chain. Let the other chain exist too. We own coins on both. 
Hodlers want value. Not the destruction of value. I support Core because they will add value to my coins. I will support BCash because I want it to add value to the fiat I exchanged for Bitcoin. Either way I will win.

Actually we grew more under the gold system than we are growing today or over the last 50 years. Growth measured in terms of the base currency is flawed. Prosperity is the best achievement. Growth is just some elite talk about how much more they can take from the world. 
Another galaxy is that deflationary currencies will lead to system collapse. Systems have been collapsing for centuries. It's part of the cycle. The current system will collapse too. That's why people buy gold, silver, and crypto. Bitcoin has infinite supply. All you have to do is add more 000's. Of course the ones closer to the decimal point will become richer but it's not different than an inflationary fiat. 
Imagine and dream in the future where the neocabal gets together to add three 000's beyond the Satoshi. Even if half of the btc are gone you just increased the available amount of Satoshis by 1000x.

Good read. If a node devotes 200MB space allocation for LN we are still using the existing hardware. So Satoshi was right again. Also, as Hal had said we need a light client. LN is a light client. Don't think that LN changes the infrastructure. Existing nodes can and will act as hubs. As they are wallets that can leverage a balance to facilitate the LN transactions. 
By the way. A lot of this scaling was written before Bitcoin even existed. Satoshi admitted it had to be this way. This was years in the making. We are rehashing old protocols that died before Bitcoin. It was all written before the white paper existed. So the comment made is true. But not in the meaning you want it to be. 
Bitcoin is a binary innovation. It will either be worthless or massively successful. Bcash is just a part of it. Only thing I see as a flaw is why would a user want an 8X block with a 10 minute confirm when you can get a 8.8X combined block equivalent with a 2.5 minute confirm with LTC. Also, malleability will not be an issue with LTC. So pardon me for saying big blockers are on the wrong chain. LTC is a big block separated by 4 smaller blocks.

I never thought of it as an investment. Always peer to peer cash. I use it to buy stuff. It goes up in fiat prices but that means I can buy the same amount and save more of my purchasing power.

Don't blame Core. Blame the miners. Core does receive any of these fees. Blame miners. Core has given the community an option to have lower fees. But miners took it as a vote. It's not a vote. The majority of the community wants segwit. We are waiting for them to signal if they are ready. We don't care about this blocksize stuff. We want fast tx without restraints. Again blame miners. If they want to fork they can. But they have nothing to fork too. Bitcoin users are not like Ethereum users. We don't have to follow the majority hash. Because we know we make the longest chain. We know Bitcoin is not about who controls or has the majority hash. We are not that gullible.

I had this conversation before. No reason to switch to a different implementation. 
Segwit is not a dead end. It was just rolled out in the wrong manner. Miners don't function as the source of approval for upgrades or protocol changes. Nodes enforce rules. So that responsibility lies within them. 
For too long we have been catering to miners. Now that effect they have is being misused. This was not supposed to be about control. We need a balance. Allowing users and the community to be involved in this process is justified. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:51:54
iYes and no. Segwit allows for more tx per block yes. But it still works within the same dynamics of a 1MB block. This alone will not scale to visa levels. But what segwit does is fix issues related to off chain innovation. 
With the combination of onchain throughout capacity added and a robust environment off chain, Bitcoin can and will scale to beyond Visa levels. Not just for buying stuff either. You can enable users to be paid offchain. You can add options and tokens. 
This you can't do with just a xMB increase. And it's not whether a xMB increase is NOT needed it will. But holding back the innovation off chain does no one any good. Not all tx needs to be on chain. Not all tx needs to be off chain. But restricting the possibility of off chain is restricting Bitcoin capabilities. 
Bitcoin has more resemblance to transportation than being a monetary protocol. Walking, busses, cars, trains, planes, boats interconnect human mobility. It enables a free market for moving ppl from one location to the other.

I don't want this to be about miners. Upgrade please is all. Nodes enforce the rules. UASF should be the norm for soft forks. The real question is. Do you need 95% of them signaling for it to be effective. I don't think so. I think only 30% will actually run segwit code. And that's all you need. If you have nodes and a few miners that's it. The rest of the community is behind segwit.

Core is not one person. Any group of developers will be perceived as centralized. But I really do like the multiple implementation part if we can really pull it off.

The day a major government is found buying Bitcoin as a reserve is the day Bitcoin will have a million dollar gap. Maybe even more. They can print there own money. So why not allow them to exchange more for less. 
The day a major government is found buying Bitcoin will be the day that governments fiat will be declared useless. Why take their fiat when they are buying your Bitcoin. So you just demand what gold!  Or there everlasting supply of fiat. 
That was the gold problem in the 70's. Countries were printing fiat and demanding the US gold. Once Nixon realized this he closed the window. What would you want. A vault full of gold or useless fiat the country will no longer take.

Those fractions of Bitcoin owners hodl more than half of the supply of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:27:39
You are adding new units to the system. But that should only occur when we stray from equilibrium. If the value of BTC increases as the supply decreases that means more goods can be bought. That will increase the prices of goods. Which will reach a point where we reach another equilibrium. If the price of goods to money don't reach equilibrium and people can't buy things you add another 0. 
This solves the reason why the gold standard failed. The dollar was pegged to a physical asset in limited supply. When SHTF people were not demanding more dollars to pay off the debt. They were demanding gold. If all the gold was gone the dollar had no real appeal to hold. Once the gold standard was gone we went into a period of inflation. More dollars were printed than the actual gold used. 
So then we had oil tied to the dollar. Bad thing about that is we use it. Once it's out of the ground and burned we don't burn the dollars. So then we progressed to a debt based system we have today. Only thing is too much debt leads to high cost to service. So we print more money to dilute the debt. But it also dilutes the earning power or purchasing power of every dollar. 
By adding a zero you make every one richer. But that is only for those who haven't died or lost their keys. Satoshi has 1MM btc that hasn't moved. So really before we ever reach 21 million it's already deflating. You add a zero for the loss. His coins are not coming back.

I do understand the whole picture. It has its technical aspects but you can't make everything ideal. I know how Bitcoin works for me. 
But changing the transaction structure is not an issue for the end user. Most don't care. Same as removing the headphone jack on the iPhone. As long as it came with something they can use to listen to music. Next, point I see is you fail to see humans tend to adapt. Sure the wallets will be new but that's not that much of an issue. Wallet providers will make the effort to accommodate us. It's not just protocol devs. 
So thanks for the read. SW is complex but it's opt in. So it's use if you want to. It's not mandatory. If users don't like it then they don't use it. And really it's about LN. It's always been about off chain for us. BU, classic, XT, EC, nChain or whatever they throw at us at a minimum offer that. Not in a year or even six months we don't want to wait.

Of course they have no clue. Most will not understand how this consensus mechanism really works. They think 148 will cause a chain split. It won't. It's a contributing factor but not the cause. 91 does the same thing. It's proposed by btc1. Both will orphan blocks for not signaling 1. If anyone wants segwit at this point you either run 148 or 91 when it's available. Then if you go past that the HF you have to run segwit2x. 
But first thing first. Nodes are running 148. 91 will follow. Even with the 85% hashrate for segwit2x. They will have to run the code. 
What I'm saying is miners are now under a situation of losing money for the consequences. They may think this is unfair to them and threaten a chain split. The reality is nodes enforce the rules. BIP 148 and 91 when available will enforce rules. They will orphan blocks to those not following the rules. That's how Bitcoin works. Rules enforced by code. You run the code that best suits you. If you want to enforce rules run a full node. If you don't run a full node and miners want something you don't like it's your own fault. Bitcoin is permission less.

You hit the nail in the coffin. This decentralization of mining will not be fixed by code. It will be fixed by the free market. The incentive is there and both sides are stalling. For what selfish egos. It's maybe 40 that matter in this debate out of millions. 
Does segwit make sense it you have billions of dollars on the sideline waiting for it. They are putting some money to work just to use as political capital.  
But you also have billions of dollars on the side that want a 2MB HF too. And they are using their political capital to get it. 
Everyone is waiting as 40'people do politics. Miners that want a HF are not asking for it to happen now. They are asking for what conditions it would take to have one done. Same as the HK agreement. LTC did exactly as their customers demand. 
Alt coins are rising because people are hedging there bets in Bitcoin. They will easily take it off the table as long as both sides settle. Remember it's only 40 people. 
The markets and us want clarity. We know our choice is Segwit and 2MB. So we say both. LTC increased 10x in a few weeks because not only did they get segwit but they got a 2MB HF too agreed on. That's clarity. That's certainty. 
Last so why can't BU just code a 2MB HF and be done. Because just like miners the market wants Core to do it. The market wants a plan. Not this ambiguity of mudslinging. They know dropping the price to force a solution will not work. Take out the whole network for 40 people. 
The HF needs to have conditions set just like LTC accomplished. It must be written by Core. It must be studied tested and reviewed. But you can't get that by saying Segwit first then we will think about it. That's not how this is going to work. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 00:44:03

By the way Luke thank you for all your efforts. And for those of you who support BU. It's done. Jihan moved on. He know has his sights on EC or whatever.

Actually a segwit txn does have the signature data in the block. Only segwit nodes will see it. 1MB Blocks will not. So net effect you will be able to fit more txn per 1MB. But Segwit nodes will effectively be about 2.2MB. Segwit txn will be cheaper. That's part of the issue. Miners don't feel devs should discount it. Basically it gives users the incentive to use segwit txn. But the reality is users will migrate to LN. That is what segwit true purpose is. Fixing malleability which makes using LN easier. 
Here is my take: Miners were asked in good faith to accept that the network is going to upgrade. They took it as a vote. So they have hi jacked the upgrade to make demands for a HF. All the chainsplits and HF talk is an attack. A threat. Most users in this really don't care what the miners want. We want LN. But there is no reason to compromise based on a few miners being malicious.

It only works for the traders. They set the price. Roger doesn't want a separate coin. Just like Jihan it's all about control. They really think they are OPEC. The level of collusion is high. 
As long as they can strangle Bitcoin enough to keep them as main influence then status quo is ok. A HF only doesn't allow for LN or sidechains. You are stuck with the mainchain and the miners. They don't want competition. The mainchain is there bread and butter. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 18:08:21
My funny way of thinking is that you first let Bitcoin and the other viable cryptos encompass a the value of debt and derivatives. Then nation states would be smart to mine just for the fees to sustain the economy. Those who have these coins will be rich for generations but it's no different from the fiat system. Those who have coins will be distribution mechanisms. Every time you buy something you add liquidity to the system. 
We have exchanges so if a nation or two wants just Litecoin then you change your Bitcoin when you get there. Stuff like that
@_date: 2019-05-25 14:33:17
This maybe a good way for some. But not many. The fees for you to replace what you spent will add up. Plus by doing what you are doing you are not using block space wisely either. Someone has to store a record of your tx on chain forever. I do understand the tools for making those type of payments are in process and being developed in the wild. And if you are a regular you may want to have whomever you are paying migrate to LN. Then just open a channel with them. This will also grow the network. You will benefit more by doing it this way than just using the mainchain. And if enough of us do this the exchanges will follow too.
@_date: 2018-12-06 09:56:18
It dropped by 40% because the price dropped. Also when newer more efficient miners come to play the old ones shut off. Even with the drop it still takes a lot of resources to 51% attack bitcoin. Projects that still use gpu’s are likely candidates because the gpu’s don’t have an efficiency gain. And with many surplus gpu’s out there it’s easier to do such an attack.

I think it's best we work through this on this type of framework. Best if we can get much of the Core roadmap done between the time we need to HF. We may not need the extra capacity but it never hurts to have more than less. The idea to reach a consensus is to agree. Not to continue coming up with more ideas. 
My example: my speedometer on my car reads 120 mph max. But the highest speed limit for roads is 70 mph. So why do I need a car that goes faster than the speed limit. I don't. It's just marketing. It sells. Sell a HF. This has no technical merits at all. It's marketing.

BU or EC is a non starter. Not a single business or the economic nodes will ever allow miners control what size the block is for them. Those implementations give miners a veto for anything. Then we are going to be stuck with what have today. No chance for anything off chain. They will always veto it. Let the nodes determine the path of Bitcoin. A signed statement is all that's needed. If segwit is not enough then we HF to 2MB. But segwit has to come first. Miners got there veto. After this times out we will user activated soft fork. If miners want to act malicious like now they lose money.

The people making consensus into voting are the ones who want to add cyanide to the soup. Being impartial to this situation comes to a reason of truth. Segwit is not opt in. BIP 9 made it as miners decide something they don't have to run. This whole campaign was built around at 95% mistake. This whole campaign has foundation of personal discourse for one group or another. 
You may not like Segwit but the reality is some do. And by treating a soft fork as if it's a hard fork does not look good for future MASF. 
Bitcoin has not failed. MASF has failed. Now playing the blame game on something that should have been relatively simple is not.

That's not the best approach. Especially since btc1 devs probably don't understand segwit. So the mix of a soft fork with a hard fork is not wise nor smart. It's much easier to do segwit first stand alone then do the hard fork stand alone. I don't oppose any hard fork as long as it's not a political fork. We really need that 2X though even with segwit. But one at a time by different dev teams too. That's how you progress. That's how you keep from stressing users on fees. But you have to remember there is a lot of innovation waiting on segwit for the malleability fix. And that miners nor anyone should hinder. ETH grows because they off more than on chain. Bitcoin will grow like that but better.

From an old node perspective a segwit tx will not have any signature data. But from a segwit node the data will be included. You have to see it from both perspectives of who sees what. Same goes with miners. Segwit miners will get paid for a segwit tx but a non segwit miner who will not get the witness data from a segwit tx type. 
But miners get to select which tx they put in blocks. A non segwit miner can process a segwit tx but will take a discount for doing so. A segwit miner can process a non segwit tx without a discount. But some miners feel they don't want segwit for this discount reason. They will process 2x more but only get fees for 1.7x. 
To overcome this not realizing what segwit does these miners want to increase the blocksize thinking it will close the discount. It won't. If you keep the blockweight at 4MB, the blocksize won't go over 1MB. Even if you change blocksize to 20MB. From 0.14.0 on its block weight that increases the block size.

lol technology seeks an efficient path. I'm sure I can fund a channel to pay someone who doesn't have to fund a channel. That's how services rendered is done. Why would I want to put money in a channel to sells groceries. The food is my collateral. Also, the payee doesn't have to broadcast to the main chain after a series of tx with one entity. They can pay multiple entities through an established channel. Alice pays Bob through Charlie. Then Alice pays mike through Bob. Mike pays Charlie through through Alice. These are payment paths. So as long as your wallet has funds available you really don't have to broadcast to the main chain unless you think you are being cheated.

They don't get it eustan. 148 is not a new consensus. It's a new enforcement of consensus. That what nodes do. We enforce the rules. Since Segwit2x is now compatible it means we are enforcing it on Aug 1. They don't understand that nodes are the reason miners get paid. 100 confirmations needed. And do miners want to lose money or act political. Politics will not pay. Code does not play politics or rhetoric. It executes. If a miner wants to split off I wish them well.

We would all have to run BTC1 code. Miners can't force you to run code. HF are not opt in. The developers across the protocol would have to code for Segwit, Segwit2x, and bchain. So why not just develop for bchain and Segwit only. I'm pretty sure they have code ready for just segwit right now. Work smarter not harder. Either way you get coins from both chains

When you run your own full node it is the way to trust. You trust what you own. When you rely on other people with full nodes you have to trust them. The same as you have to trust a bank. Wells Fargo once opened accounts for there customers and ran balances with there money. Then charged over drafts fees to boot. 
The cost to run a node is infinite. You get no subsidy nor fees. But it allows you to enforce the current rule set of the software. Miners cannot do what they want. They have to follow the rules enforced by nodes or lose money.

Considering Bitcoin converted into fiat as inflation or a deflation type of currency is still up for debate. One btc can represent $2000 dollars or it can represent $100MM. That's inflation in fiat terms. Goods are priced in fiat not btc. So till that day where mostly everything is represented in btc it's yet to be proven. This is a new concept. I'm trying not to fit it into an old paradigm. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:08:46
This is why we need to be decentralized. Decades ago we fought against monopolies. Now politicians and markets favor them. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 01:01:18
My theory to what you are thinking. In classical economics inflation is the expansion of the money supply. It has been that way for centuries. In modern times inflation is measured in expansion of credit or debt. So countries grow based on the ability for it to take on more debt. The more we borrow the more inflation we get. Still no matter what you call it inflation is the expansion of the money supply. Debt has to be paid back. 
Now as for Bitcoin it has a fixed upper limit for supply. But it can be expanded yes by adding more zeros. This is not inflation. 1 btc does not turn into 2. At some point in time 1 btc will reach a value that meets the demand of it users. This is equilibrium. This will be done on a global scale. 
So what happens over time is people will lose there private keys. People will pass and there private keys will go with them. The number of available whole btc will decline. This is deflation. So in order to keep btc at equilibrium for demand you add a 0 or two. Will this create a higher price for it in fiat. Yes it will. But the time it reaches equilibrium most of all the gains from appreciation will be gone. 
We will pass off to future generations a monetary system that reflects the demand for their use of the worlds resources. As the cost of goods rise then the value of Bitcoin will rise. If the cost of goods deflate then the value of btc will fall. The whole idea is to keep btc at equilibrium with demand. It will truly be a new economic era. There will still be rich and there will still be poor but overall the system won't some at the expense of others monetarily. 
Hoarding. This is a myth. In the current state it is being hoarded. But not to the point it doesn't circulate. The fiat system with its inflationary policies for the last few decades has led to massive hoarding. That's why we have more and more billionaires. They are hoarding dollars. While the rest deal with friction of life. We have to spend for food and shelter and that takes most of our fiat. This system doesn't reward savings because they get inflated away. If you own assets that appreciate as much as inflation. Your savings don't fall but rise over time. But just keeping money in the bank does nothing. As for Bitcoin though this hoarding will subside at the time of equilibrium. Then those who hoard will have to spend vs save in order to maintain a certain level for quality of life. Or in other terms it will cause the price of goods to decrease. 
Bitcoin is all about supply and demand. There will be periods of expansion of value. And there will be periods of contraction of value. That's true money.

This is not true about Bitmain. This is the reality. Jihan just wants a HF beyond 1MB. More miners want a HF beyond 1MB. Many Bitcoin companies want a HF beyond 1MB. And they want segwit to. It's the bitterness of them digging in as the segwit only side digs in. 
I run a node and from my perspective I can control my bandwidth. I don't need 20-50 connected peers. But I tried it for weeks at different settings. And my tolerable level is 34 connected peers at this 1MB. So if blocks are segwit I need 20 connected peers. If segwit plus 2MB it's 12 connected peers. If the actual blocks become 8MB then it's 5 connected peers. Catch my drift. It's not science for this. It's just math. I started out a long time ago with just 5 connected peers. 
This debate is about humans. We have coopted fiat politics into it. Choose your side. And as for centralization it's projection of centralization. 
Centralization in the oil field. It doesn't exist. There are hundreds of companies that drill for oil. Even at these prices. Technology cures centralizing. Then saying bigger blocks lead to centralizing but off chain doesn't. The argument does not stick. Really the blocksize doesn't determine centralizing. The price of btc does. It's no different from oil. So as long as the price increases you will find some who want to mine. More mining equipment manufacturers will come into play. Bitcoin is not some special field exempt from market forces.

We could have done LN without segwit. But it would be very cumbersome for the user. What you are witnessing is the same thing that happened with Bitcoin. It’s called the network effect. But now it’s a network effect built on top of a network effect. There is a video out there where one guy is dancing in a field. Many ppl are standing around just watching. After a few seconds someone else joins in. By the end everyone is dancing. It’s a natural occurrence. Some can call it organic. 
Other fans of other projects can and will say they can do the same thing. But in reality they too are sitting and just watching others dance. They may never join in because they think if they wait long enough those who are dancing will come sit next to them. 
Examples: Occupy Wahl Street, the million man march, Yellow vest, Arab spring, BTS, Burning man, and many more. 
Anyone trying to build an alternative network will have to have 1000x better or meaningful reason to overcome the primary network. What you see in crypto is what we in economics call crowding out. Each alt tries to build its network effect off the experience of the Bitcoin network effect. Each alt network actually pulls resources from each other. 
The longer LN exist without something comparable the stronger the network effect will become. But remember the main chain is building a network effect too. This is why though it’s similar LTC has a smaller network. Which means it’s L2 network will be smaller.

All these points mentioned are valid. But the approach to convince them is wrong. I do it simply by giving them a backstop. Tell your friend to buy $20 worth. That’s all. But explain to them if bitcoin goes to zero then you’ll give them $20 back. If they sell it for a loss you will not reimburse them for speculating. If they lose them you will not reimburse them. The only way you will reimburse them is if the price goes to Zero. 
Why do I do this? Because it makes them put skin in the game. Also, it’s an amount that most ppl won’t ever complain about losing. After doing this for four years I have yet to reimburse anyone. And all of them have added 1000’s of USD on top of the initial amount. 
I’ve seen ppl buy $100’s worth of lottery tickets in a year. What they get back in return is 99% worthless. I currently have 400 ppl who bought at $10k and above who are now starting to understand. They are the demand. Every Satoshi they own is a Satoshi no one else will. And the fact that with the lottery you either win something or lose it all is far worse than losing 50%.

He's actually wrong by stating he makes 150%. That is based on fiat prices. So the price of btc has to go up or he doesn't make money. 2013 is an example. 
Today miners are coddled into thinking the price has no effect because it leads difficulty increases. But I dare this dude to split with is friends to mine BitcoinABC. If the price is not within 85% of the split price then basically those miners will be bricked. But I welcome them to split. The large exchanges are coming out saying they will not support ABC not matter how much hash power they have. And if you can't get Coinbase to buy in then you really have no support. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:31:50
 Don't put too much weight I to this miner hash power junk. They put txs in blocks and broadcast to the nodes. From there nodes determine if it is a valid block. Nodes enforce the rules. It maybe easier to use hashing to measure sentiment but it isn't the only method to use. We could use a flag day. Which is a determined day that nodes will enforce a rule set.  If miners don't follow there blocks get rejected.

And unlike you I come from the most decentralized industry globally. Oil. How do we do it yet Bitcoin because we understand competition and markets drive prices. Oil markets are diverse mix of oligarch, dictators, pirates, capitalist, nation states and independents.  So please don't tell me that decentralization is just some tech thing. 92 million barrels per day coming from over 300 sources. Billions of dollars per year. Exxon just spent $8B in one state alone. So wake up. 
Here are some stats just for the US
1. 15.7 million millionaires. Get 10% to run a node. 1.57 million nodes
2. 2300 electric companies that generate electricity. Get 10% to mine btc. That's 230 mining pools
3. 347 million ppl in the country. Get 10% to buy and use Bitcoin. That's 34.7 million. Add in 10% of the median income and you get $5500 per person bring a market cap to $190B. 
This is just the US. Now spread it globally. But hey thinking small gets you small results. I don't care about whatever Bitmain does. But I can tell you this. There is billions sitting on the table to buy Bitcoin. Billions. Yet you find yourself fighting over a parameter. The world is a lot bigger than you think. Start thinking that way and you will see exactly what Satoshi saw in 07. 
Oh the state of Montana just helped fund a mining pool to create jobs. More states could do the exact same things. Taxpayers creating meaningful work for other taxpayers.

 I'm just saying the realities. 90% of startups fail. You can fund them all you want. It still doesn't matter. Maybe I'm more conservative than most. I just think for my money I would prefer more the a websites and a Blockchain plan. Customers don't just appear out of thin air. Too many are focused on what the prices are in a field of dreams. Bitcoin gets a bad rap over this debate but in Japan alone they will have almost 1 million companies that allow customers to use Bitcoin as a payment method. If each company accepted 1 tx per day that's 3 days worth of tx. That's real.

You must be talking about a different Wahl Street than I’ve known for the last 20 yrs. Take for example the housing collapse. Who bought up all those foreclosed homes for pennies on the USD. Wahl Street. When a bank goes bust who buys up that bank Wahl Street. When it comes to crashes Wahl Street has pretty much always bought cheap/ distressed assets. I’m not saying bitcoin is depressed but it’s 80% off it’s high. The network is still growing. More user tools are being developed. LN, RSK, Liquid are all being used. Satellites, gotenna, BTCpay and many more are in the mix. 
Bloomberg puts out hit pieces for you to read. But Wahl Street is usually doing the opposite. You yourself still have this attitude that somehow bitcoin is going away. It’s not. If price confirmed what was going on or development then why is it just last week that Venezuelans bought 2000 btc in a week. That’s an all time high for the country. Why are custody solutions being marketed to the wealthy. Why are governments around the world codifying legislation around crypto? 
Maybe a trading desk was not what institutional investors wanted. That’s what Goldman was doing. Now they have moved to custody. Wahl Street is venturing with its own exchanges like Bakkt.

No that's not what I said. But you want to think that way. It's flawed because it doesn't mean voting. But that's how it's taken as a vote. It's the same as updating a phone. Or a network of phones. No one has to wait because of a few hold outs. That's what opt in is for. You may want this consensus mechanism to be a voting system but that is not the intent. This is why I call it flawed. It's not a vote. 
I could careless if blocks were 8MB. Segwit, or whatever. My node can handle it. My bandwidth use can change. But I only speak for myself. What I would like to see is segwit as a stand alone then a 8MB HF. Then a soft fork to include working height at 2MB. That will basically mean block size increases become softforks to 8 MB. Then to increase the block size you just use a flag day.

Next I wait for it to have an exchange to trade it on. But then I need gas to transfer it using the ETH network. By them time it really trades the peg is less than my actual btc. You wake up to what the reality is and go to exchange it back to btc. By that time the multisig wallet is gone. Vanished. It’s no different than bitconnect.

Many businesses are with Bitmain because he crippled there growth but is blaming it on core. So to get there loyalty he funds them. That makes it seem like he's on there side. He's not. The high fees, the slow confirmations, the FUD is all a coordinated effort for him and others to control Bitcoin. Now UASF has pushed it because he can't pay off everyone.

Whether is UASF or segwit2x it will be segwit. I'm not for sure but if a 1MB chain with segwit interacts with a 2MB chain with segwit that we will ever notice till the blocks fill up. Maybe some one will chime But by my thinking the algo will tend to merge based on the tightest ruleset of similarities. If the only difference is the blocksize the smaller one will be enforced until it becomes max then those nodes will reject blocks. It won't matter how much miner hash the 2x has. Mixing segwit with anything I don't think is wise. But then maybe a dev will step in

Don't say we. I'm not the one trying to defend a side. I'm trying to defend Bitcoin. I like Core for the technical aspects they bring to the table. But when I look at parallel industries like oil the arguments don't all add up. The blocksize like the size of the hole is trivial to me. It's what comes out or how many you can get into the block. 
Bitcoin itself wants to expand to reach as many people on this globe. But we have restrictions. So the best solution is to reach as many as you can. But 1MB blocks will not do it. It needs segwit and 2MB. On the MB side just 2 is not rational. We are leaving this debate for future generations. That's madness. That's selfish. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:05:21
Time is ticking. And I'm not the idealist. If Segwit2x works then let's use it. Only thing I don't like about it is the 2x. I want it to be 8x as a HF then 2x as a SF. No reason to trickle up when the time is needed. Setup future generations too. But continuous crisis does nothing

It's not a matter of trusting segwit. They put the trust into ppl/devs. They didn't deliver so miners won't deliver. It's that easy. Miners are in a win win situation. They get a block subsidy. The rest of the Bitcoin ecosystem actually has to work. They have to promote themselves. They have to get users. 
It seems unfair but this is how it is. But that is the design. Miners are responsible for distributing new btc. But that also incentivized them to be in charge as centralizing forces took over. 
This is not about segwit.

By year end Bitcoin will be available for use in almost 1 million stores in Japan. That does not get reflected into Bitcoin market cap. It is not getting reflected into Bitcoin price. Why? Because ppl still have this tie between market and stocks. ETH has a model that creates new Dapps. This is what is creating the price rises. But 90% of all start up fail. So 90% of all Dapps will fail.

The issue with market capitalization for Bitcoin is basically this. There isn't 16 million floating on the exchanges. It only represents a small number of bitcoins that exist in the market. To get a true capitalization you have to quantify the economic capital, hodlers, and the daily volume on the exchanges. That is the market.

I'm taking it as they just don't like the 95% thresh hold. The hostage taking clause. But I've come to terms that basically Jihan took advantage of the system. We are all paying for it. That's how a malicious miners work. And the risk to this proposal are still a chain split just for an upgrade. 
The real cure for this is higher priced btc. More mining equipment manufacturers to boot. As long as Bitmain has this advantage it's going to be hell for Bitcoin. Diversification works. Decentralizing works too. The day we get that from the manufacturing community will be great.

That's your choice. No one is stopping you from doing that. I'll be amazed if it gets pulled off. We should just let segwit run in the wild and stop trying to calculate or measure possibilities we have no clue about. We should let 2MB run too. Fear is driven by not knowing.

I would like to think that way, but I don't put my trust in the process of poor execution. Segwit is the answer and as long as Chinese miners have a say to block it they will. That's in there nature and culture. If the shoe was on the other foot saying a 95% thresh hold against segwit it's different. The mechanism is wrong. It's not segwit. It's the mechanism.

I’m running it. But you don’t have to use their hub. You can use your own LN node with it. Goto setting. Lightning setting. Then change the address to your own node. Or you can have one wallet on their node and one wallet on yours. I like it. I think it’s a good solution to onboarding users to LN. Gives them the option to not use a trusted third party. Is available for iOS. Can be used on your phone. It’s open source so existing mainchain wallet providers can just copy the code and run with it.

Yes but it has limits too. Here's the big question. If there is a chain split who owns the relay nodes. You can't really have an effective network globally without them. Bitcoin is not just mining. And the other hought is what is easier to contain 55000 nodes or 300 large data center nodes. I would think the US could target any large concentration of Bitcoin infrastructure with a few drones. That's the scary part of Bitmains vision. $40B in market cap is less than A few days of central banker money for Japan, China,US, and EU. And the US has no bounds. China will not protect Jihan. Japan will not protect Roger. None of these players that want a centralized Bitcoin will be spared. Even the ETH ppl don't understand. The reason Bitcoin has lasted is because it became like the drug cartels decentralized.

As for being subversive to government. It really isn't. Governments a free to join. It's permission less. The issue governments have is they want to make rules. But Bitcoin doesn't care about that.

Most of thenodes are BIP 141 compliant or just 1MB. If you see the changes they make for Segwit2X it's apparent they want to remove the discount. They want to limit the capacity for Segwit nodes too. Btc1 devs are acting in the interest of the miners not the protocol. Just like politicians act in the interest of corporations. That's not Bitcoin. 
The scenario you get when segwit does lock in. You have these new nodes (Segwit2X) nodes that get banned. Blocks get orphaned too. Miners lose money then guess what happens. They blame segwit. But 141 nodes will have a consensus to follow segwit rules not Segwit2X rules. Till they can come up with this blocksize increase they have been fighting for for years segwit nodes will be 141. No contract can make them change.

This is just how Bitcoin doesn't work. No one has considered that the reason Bitcoin can't change is because we don't want it too. But Bitcoin wants to change. So we have to change. Miners want a HF. But so do many Bitcoin businesses. Users want segwit and so do many Bitcoin businesses. Yet being steered by a development team or by big blockers only is not going to work. Both want Bitcoin to be great. But it's not either or. It's both. 
Bitcoin today is reflecting the political environment of the western world economies. The consensus mechanisms are broken. I don't know what party to be on anymore because I want the best for Bitcoin. So I'm choosing Bitcoin. 
1MB is a great store of value but a terrible medium of exchange. That's gold. And gold stopped being money a long time ago. Now we know Bitcoin can store value like gold, let's move towards being a medium of exchange. That is requiring Segwit AND a HF. 
The either or crowd is being misinformed at the possibilities Bitcoin has. The solution is and will always be both. Sorry to feel this way but Bitcoin wants you to change. This debate only proves we don't want to change.

This is a fallacy of logic. Having access to something does not equal using it. How many alt coins are out there. How many do you own? That's a market. That's how ppl decide in a market by choices. By keeping it at such a narrow focus has allowed this to turn into bitterness. 
It's back to what I said a few days ago. We are seeking compliance when it should be compatible. Decentralization is not a compliance project. It's a compatible project. I trust code and math. But I don't use all code or every type of math. 
I my line of proposal allows for compatibility and market consensus for utilization not access to. That's my impression of a soft fork. It may lead to more types of soft forks that go against what you want but you don't have to use it. Just like you don't have to buy every token that gets created.

I'm just using examples to iterate a point. Block size 
at this junction in time is a toxic debate to be having. And I see what Core and many other contributors are doing. It's the right track in my opinion. I just don't think incremental block size increases are the right path. Just hard fork to x then soft fork to y. Maybe not today or in the next 5 years. But setting the foundation to HF in the future is needed. Sorry I wasn't saying this as immediate or near term. That's crazy when you have other options that work. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:26:10
I’ll try. For one it drives adoption. Ppl want fast cheap txs. This drives demand for btc. This demand is supplied by miners. Which in turn makes the price increase for each coin. So they say in economics. But the price mechanism is now in the hands of speculators. Which each trade that happens doesn’t create an on chain fee for miners. If you have an issue with LN in respect to fees for miners. Then you should have a really big issue with the exchanges which are off chain too.

Actually just LN is not enough. I think the estimate of users with segwit and LN is about 300 million users. That’s still 10x more users than we have today. If we are going to hardfork I think we need more than just increasing the blocksize for Bitcoiners to accept it. And we would need a long dated time to make sure everyone signals for it and is prepared for it. Imagine having to translate all of this into over 75 languages just to start the process. But the real issue is we need to optimize as much as we can when we have the chance. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:54:34
There is a version of segwit right now. All miners have to do is signal. And demanding Core to support something is not Bitcoin. Why don't you just say this. Chinese miners signal for Segwit.

The first ICO raised $3 million. Now since the price of ETH has gone up they have $300million. If the price goes up even more they will have more to fund a dream idea. The network effect of raising capital. Those investors know this. It will continue till the capital return from the raise doesn't go up anymore. Or investor figure out they are raising too much based on the economics of ETH. If ETH ever reaches  $2k that first ICO has $2B in cash to burn. 
Bitcoin can ICO companies that already have businesses and a customer base. They just need funding. Think of industries like oil and gas, telecom, municipalities, retirement funds. They could all ICO. The anchor is btc.

It is. Really we are fighting for exactly what Bitmain wants. Do I like the NYA. No! But the reality is it gives the best of both worlds. Lower fees and will bring in more manufacturers for mining equipment. As for developers btc1 is unproven but Core can clean up the mess. I have confidence in that. 
As for nodes Core can still continue on the path to optimize the blockspace. That will lead to less need for 2x and centralization will diminish greatly.

That's just a cause to price ppl out. America will never grow again unless you change the money. Get the Fed out of the way. Let economics play out for real.

It does not require to be a simple solution. It just has to work. Let those who have the technical abilities worry about the complexity of a solution. There is too much ideology playing into this. And blocks being full is ideal. But it shouldn't be the factor that prevents off chain transactions. The code is there all they have to do is signal. After that when a HF code is ready move forward to that. You all got fooled by a mining cartel. The same thing happened in oil. Frackers are bad for the environment. Frackers will increase the cost of oil. In the end oil got cheaper. N the end Bitcoin tx's will get cheaper.

They could pay a paltry interest rate and play the network effect for atleast a decade or two. The sooner bitcoin opens up to that. The better

And yes I understand the irrational mentalities of mining pool oligarchs. Same with OPEC. They think of themselves in the same light. But I don't think 2MB or even 8MB more is contentious. That's what they say but I don't believe it. It's a power play. As a user and a node operator I'm just collateral damage. And Core wrote the BIP that gave miners a veto. That is a fact. BIP 9 95% opt in hash for something everyone wants except miners. And they are the ones who vote. Not us.

The centralizing of POW happened when the price fell. Bitmain was the only one that survived. Now to fix this we need higher prices and diversity of manufacturers. Technically it's always been 1MB blocks the whole time. To drive a higher price you have to give traders a real reason because they have no clue about economics of cartels. If decentralization is the desire. $3000 Bitcoin is not going to push the needle for other manufacturers to join the race.

No one is debating if miners care about the price of Bitcoin. This is not about price. This is about expanding. Getting more people to buy Btc. Getting them to use btc. Miners don't have any incentive to change. And if it means off chain then letting them make that decision will lead to status quo. This is nothing new. OPEC does this all the time. Say one thing mean another. Have meeting where they control the conversation. Now OPEC is stick because all efforts made didn't work. The US is still fracking. China is still buying oil from Russia. Russia is still sending natural gas to Europe. Syria is a mess.

The only reason to have segwit first is to allow all the innovation that has been developed come to play. You understand why ETH is growing. Those token sales are off chain. You buy ether. Then buy the token. Once you have the token you are on another platform. That is what Bitcoin needs now. You know how many platforms are being built for Bitcoin right now. RSK, LN, Sprite, mimble wimble, colored coins, Thunder, and many more I can't think of. Any company that wants to use Bitcoin off chain are the ones who should be vocal. The on chain businesses are holding them back. 
But after a few months of segwit, a HF is needed. But why waste a HF for 1MB increase. So we can debate this like an election cycle. No! Get segwit out of the way.

That's how supply side economics works. It favors assets and those who own it. It disregards productivity (labor). 
Bitcoin differs from this aspect. It has a fixed amount. So it is all demand driven. Less demand drives prices down. More demand drives prices up.

I understand that. But you must remember Core created the fee market. But once again miners have abused another code update. I myself think fees should be based on the amount of btc processed. Miners still get a block subsidy. But now you run into exactly what people consider it to be digital gold. And you also price out the payment system. 
A simple 25 bps per tx is warranted. That way you can drive volume. Core has done some great things but many economical errors are being made. These can be overcome but taking away the fee market will be a battle. 
Any development team that proposes a constant fee mechanism like that will be greatly supported by all users. Even those who only make $2 day. 
I guess it was strategy to push off chain but really the fee market has to go. If someone wants to spam the network they are still paying. More efficiencies are coming but I honestly feel overcoming this would advance Bitcoin further.

148 is just a mechanism for nodes to say we accept blocks signaling segwit. It will reject blocks not signaling it. If more nodes do this miners will have to make a choice. Either signal or run the risk of losing money. We don't need a majority hash to keep running. And by the looks of it Jihan is going to premine blocks anyway. Basically he's going back to a genesis block. 
Jihan can fork away anytime he wants. No one is stopping him. He is just creating drama. That's what malicious miners will do. The problem is so many have bad feelings against Core that they support him. He is playing them. Jihan is playing divide and conquer. None of those on his side see that. Just Hodl

Not really. But I don't think we will ever rely on BIP 9 again. Some Chinese miners just cut there own throats. As for activating segwit. It would be wise for them to signal BIP 9 and BIP 91. Then run BIP 141 till segwit2x is safe to run. This is the real issue. 
Once this HF goes through most likely all tx will be segwit tx. Or 8MB blocks. Then the payment processors can market there services to the world. We will be back to changing the world again.

Then we hold our nodes at 148 till the HF goes through. If Jihan doesn't signal 1 or 4 then he loses money. It's that simple. You don't even need to Sybil this. Just need a mere fraction of the nodes enforcing the rules. By default we will be enforcing Segwit 2x on Aug 1. It's compatible. Miners will keep saying this will result in a chain split. But the reality is they are going to lose money. And if a split happens it's because they are leaving the protocol. They are not the victims. We are. Let Jihan go. The other Chinese miners now have another manufacturer they can get equipment from when needed. And more manufacturers will pop up too. Prices will support it. No more asic boost. No more back doors. No more remote shut offs. 
If you want big blocks run a 148 node. Even if you don't like segwit. Enforce the code.

If a set of miners chain split that doesn't effect the legacy chain. If the economic majority nodes follow the legacy chain then migrate to segwit nothing happens but a chain split from malicious miners. Not China a malicious miner. BIP 148 will reject blocks not signaling segwit. So even if some miners do nothing and signal it will be ok. Let Jihan go. If he wants to attack he can only double spend his coins. And that is after 100 blocks.

No it's not the same. Those nodes are not signaling UASF. They are running the code. I am running the code. Aug 1 my node will reject blocks that don't signal for Segwit. If it's not 141 or NYA then it gets rejected. Plain and simple. That means miners will lose money for complacency or not intending to follow the rules. If you don't take away the incentives you will get no where. That's why this happened. Miners were free to get a block reward for holding us back. 148 nodes are the check and balance to this. 
Is it wrong for this to happen. In my opinion no. As I said this keeps those who are blocking progress honest. Roger is paying out 120% reward to run BU. On Aug 1 if those miners in his pool don't signal bit 1 or 4 they lose money. 
If you run a node and you want Segwit or 2x now, you should be running BIP 148. If you feel miners should be able to do what ever they want or how they want it, then come to reddit and complain all you want. 148 nodes will make miners have consequences for inaction or non compliance. If you don't like the 2x part just live with it. You will get segwit. There is no reason to throw the baby out with the bath water.

Miners like Jihan can use the split card. But think about it. What is more important. Making money or proving a statement or politics. I think most miners would want to make money. And losing the block reward for most is not an option. Miners have another option to get equipment now. So they can grow there operations. They don't have to rely on Bitmain anymore. Remember cartels don't like competition. I welcome more equipment manufacturers to the space. That was Jihans only leverage. Not his hashpower. Canaan and hopefully others will end the monopoly.

It’s a symbolic move on their part. When you think about it. If you own any bitcoin and understand why you own it then what is the possibility of you spending it on your cell bill. Are you going to use $100 in sats having the mindset that 1 btc = $100k- $1 million one day. My belief is eventually ppl will spend btc just like they spend USD. And that time will be closer to $175k per btc. Some ppl will have a higher limit and some will have a lower limit. But at $8k per btc is a higher cost of missing out on the future gains in purchasing power. 
What can really be a game changer for any large company would be to pay for patronage. Sort of like giving a discount but paying the discount back in sats. This is a better reward than just saying you will accept bitcoin for payments. The idea is to drive customers to your service or product. And paying discounts and cashback out in the form of bitcoin is a good way to get more ppl in the door.
