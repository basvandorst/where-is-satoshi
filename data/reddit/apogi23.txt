Kinda like the same country leading the global development of electric vehicles is the same country that can thank petroleum for savings their butts back in the 70's. Thanks petrodollar, but let's maybe think of something else?
The US isn't very good at trends like these...
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:15:24
Thank you for responding. I see USD getting skittish now that Venezuela stated they don't wish to respect OPEC and are buying oil in another currency.

I asked a very similar question on earlier and the topic was completely overlooked.
I can't help but see a lot of resemblance to bitcoin being used as a de facto proxy to purchase altcoins on exchanges like bittrex and binance. I know that USDT and Tether we're "suppose" to be the workaround for this, but in reality, if we could use fiat currency directly instead of bitcoin then would that spell bad news for bitcoin?
In this case the situation would be Venezuela undermining the US Dollar.

True. I won't deny that. However, I'm referring to innovation in the blockchain. How does blockchain prevent monopolies in an industry?
When a company has a significantly large market share in a industry and employs enough people to create a crisis if they went under how do we address that?

This pretentious attempt at patting me on the head is both arrogant and unnecessary. Your enlightened sense of the world is both undergrad and unsuited. Whenever I see people attempt to be "woke" it usually means they've reached a limit where they've stopped pursuing education.
You can't learn anything new if you think you know everything already.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:11:00
No, it absolutely cannot. We can't climb the canopies eating bugs and throwing shit at each other all day. In an advanced society such as the one we live in there is an unequal distribution of labor because the projects that we are building require more labor than most. This is basic economics 101 so miss me with the bullshit about learning.
Put down Das Kapital and go back to school. The old man was wrong and thats why every simpleton attempt at any socialist order has failed miserably.

Share holders? You mean bonds.
And yes we know who owes those bonds.

Are you trolling? I legitimately can't tell if your trying to get a reaction or you're just dangerously stupid.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:39:48
I'm confused. I thought currency and economy were closely related.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:13:48
I can't find the original thread but reading this sparked my interest.
It was extremely thorough and addressed a lot of very important points.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:18:02
Yes. Hoarding money is excessively savings it. This happened with the barons whenever they would bail out the US which was our backup whenever the economy crashed. This lead to more centralization of wealth or as I'm referring to hoarding of wealth.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:59:06
Well "technicallycorrect" money is just a transfer of value. The water, the base for the term "liquidity" may never leave the stream but it does have velocity. The velocity of money movement, or volume, is how we measure money circulation.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:34:37
I made this comment a couple weeks ago and you saw allll the conspiracy theorists creep out of the woodwork.
The Fed also has no shares although it acts as a private corporation. No one owns the Fed, but they appoint chairmen.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:05:03
False. I could say bitcoin is all one big crypto but we know that it doesn't speak on how decentralized the network is. The central bank's work independently of each other as it should be.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:04:30
I'll not take my chances on advice from a guy that I legitimately can't tell if trolling or not. BTW I was unaware you could comment on this sub with a day old account.

So how do we fix the other side of the metaphorical gold-coin? We have the currency now we need to work on the economy. You can't have one without the other.

"Too Big To Fail" absolutely exists. Take a look at Detroit in the 60's after GM went under. Crime and drugs completely took over Detroit.
A lot of people got hurt and the pain still lingers today.

We saw how a tight money policy exacerbated the Great Depression. Consumption is like gas in the economic engine. If we take away money from the economy in the form of savings then it does have a direct effect on consumption. That's why we analyze PC+PS=1 in macroeconomics. The propensity to save and consume are inversely correlated. This is mostly because firms need loans to expand and employ.
You can use your capital to loan to businesses but as time goes on the interest accrued would just make you more and more money. This is why we supply income into the economy to compensate.
In a fixed supply such as bitcoin, this would be impossible as we would eventually reach a point where loaning out money would be impossible.
As far as personal liberty I agree no one has the right to take away your wealth, but there should be incentives to spend more than save.

Taking a look at our GDP very little goes towards corporate subsidies although I agree Walmart is not necessary. We should be paying for companies that need them not Walmart who refuses to pay their employees fair wages.
Your utopian mentality though will only lead to pain and anger. I don't want crypto to be remembered at the thing that brought us back into the dark age... I won't support a deadly revolution that only allows dictators to enter in our collapse.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:04:39
Sounds pretty anarcho-communist. We have a lot of evidence in history that shows anarchy is not sustainable.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:36:21
Don't take my skepticism as me personally attacking your belief. I'm raising questions that need to be asked. I want this public debate to be a way of getting people to think about this topic.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:31:43
Yes and no. Would you say the same about our utility companies or energy companies?
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:22:46
Do you think the number of central banks we have now are decentralized enough?
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:00:44
I don't think primitive methods of organized labor are compatible with our advanced society. You're asking us to regress not progress.
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:19:22
That sound very similar to unemployment insurance which is a welfare program that has been proven very useful. The big issue I see is making sure the people use the money to consume and strengthen the economy instead of saving it.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:28:18
Yes and no. Yes, you can create trust-laws that collude corporations but we are actively working to take these cartels down. The efficacy is debatable.
I'm referring to companies that require an enormous amount of resources to start and sometimes will never be profitable. To an investor, these projects don't have appeal.
Elon Musk always hated the joke because he was asked it all the time "How do you make a small chunk of money from aerospace company? Start with a large chunk of money." The exact quote is unavailable to me atm. Think industries such as Utilities, Energy, Aerospace, Transportation, etc...
There is a big difference between the amount of resources you need to start a automotive company and a flower shop.
@_date: 2018-04-18 14:01:55
They should be separated but like I said I know that's not how we have it now.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:11:02
The automotive industry back then was not caused by government intervention but maybe perhaps lack of intervention?
I might have misunderstood your statement. Cronyism isn't caused by the state it is caused by the absence of it. Some markets can work in unbridled markets but some cannot. We can use economic metrics to help us identify where the line is such as Herfindahl Index and Price Elasticity.

So history is completely useful? I'll reiterate. The protocol may change but the people don't.
@_date: 2018-04-18 03:10:43
I'm still confused. Have you never had a savings account set aside?
Hoarding money is used as a blanket for economic turbulence. If we consume too fast we create inflation although in the world of bitcoin I don't know how that's handled.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:20:20
So before the state, we were all employed? Again I want to emphasize the large amount of historical evidence showing that state regulation is a consequence of monopolies, not the cause.
A barrier to entry is a big cause of monopoly formation and not all barriers are created by the state.

It's like a parent letting a kid walk around with a loaded firearm while they yell at the parent "stop oppressing me"
The consequences of letting this situation occur can create large ramifications on society. If you're okay with that then it's honest not a discussion on economy it's a discussion on morals.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:49:32
Except when it's in circulation. If it was all on marginal propensity to save then the economy would crash.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:46:29
How do you stop someone from hoarding money from the rest of the population? We saw this issue happen with J.P. Morgan.
Wouldn't a mass accumulation of assets be more centralized?
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:34:42
How do we fix consumption after a market crash if everyone becomes unemployed? We need consumption and when people don't have money they can't consume.
@_date: 2018-04-17 23:29:18
Okay I understand now. Too big too fail is referring to an institution that would have very large adverse effects if it failed.
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:51:42
I forgot to mention that federal government and federal reserves are two separate entities. We don't want politicians controlling the economy. We don't want economists handling politics.
I know that it's not the clean-cut but we should strive to separate the two in context of each other.

Your comment makes no sense. How is it Detroit's fault? How does it prove his point?
@_date: 2018-04-19 01:10:18
There are no shares because no one "owns" the Fed. We have chairmen and women who are making economic discussions using metrics that are widely available to the public.

Slavery is definitely a part of anarcho-capitalist society. I've also had conversations with an-caps that view disabled individuals as leeches due to the fact they cannot provide labor.
There is a lot of debate on where to draw the line between profit and ethics. Should everything be a commodity?

At this point discussion seems moot until we have more data. I agree this is a topic that needs to be looked at more.

Okay, [Diogenes]( Whatever you say.
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:54:46
I walked into this debate expecting a degree of pushback so don't worry about it.
I actually wonder the same thing. It seems like there's a hard decision between allowing banks to fail and face massive unemployment and bailing them out which is just rewards dangerous business practise.
It's an unnecessary evil but what happened happened.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:21:33
This is a great point. From what I've learned in my experience not only studying the economy but also working as a life insurance agent is we really don't have an efficient way of handling generational wealth.
Adam Smith talked a little about giving wealthy members of society trophies instead of wealth as an encouragement to invest in the community. Statues, Libraries, Hospitals, etc. are all examples of this.
I honestly don't have a legitimate answer.

I'm working on a similar whitepaper that shows the correlation between Hirfandahl Index and price elasticity in the Ethereum market. I'll organize the different tokens by utility and then measure each group. I think will help people create better portfolios.
So far the total Hirfandahl Index of top 100 crypto tokens if 2,601. For anyone that's wondering.
I definitely will never be a dev but I love researching different economic theories. There is a lack of economic debate in the crypto community imo.

I absolutely love the debate between Hayek and Keyes. Personally, I've evaluated both sides and I agreed with Keyes but it was because he created a much more solid argument than Hayek but depending on this debate we could see a very different outcome. Hayek had trouble discussing where the boundary should be in deciding what Government should and should not regulate. It wasn't until many years later he proposed a solution but at that time they had already agreed to use Keynesian model.
Vitalik Buterin also used this debate to create a hard-cap April fools joke on twitter. [See here](
EDIT: How the frick have I never stumbled across this video? Dear god thank you!
