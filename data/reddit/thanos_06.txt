Cool!  Does this work in it's full potential or still in Beta phase?

That's good to know, users can directly chat with other users about their problem. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 10:20:14
If only I had enough money to donate, you wouldn't see gestures like these from other exchanges.

If this guy had his funds in Paxful this problem wouldn't last a day or two, but three years by lbc? You guys are totally slacking not valuing your users. As obviously stating lbc and Paxful are both p2p platforms Paxful is outstanding in my opinion because, their support really gets at it with user concerns (including mine) which gives me a feeling of relief that I am not alone solving a problem. I feel bad for this guy, I hope he hasn't given up, take this to court!

Whatever it is, probably you just didn't like how [bitcoin.org]( went about with this change but things do happen.

Isn't this the same company that steals user data?

Should be placed in every bank and atm.. Banks in different countries already banned cryptocurrencies for security issues, but I guess some are just threatened with it and its advantages for blockchain technology, what do you guys think though?
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:27:24
They've been shady ever since, i'm not really surprised. Things like this though makes other p2p platforms look bad but, it's just really lbc that's doing shit lately.

Best way? Register an account with peer to peer platform like Paxful, been using them for quite some time already. They have a wide aray of payment methods, in which they specialize in gift cards to purchase bitcoins instantly, and also using bank transfers.

ATM would be quite difficult to do so, I would suggest going to a peer\-to\-peer platform, ever heard of Paxful? They got lots of payment options so i'm sure you can sell it anyway you want it over there, hope this helps you! 
@_date: 2018-10-24 09:44:03
This is really a good thing! 
@_date: 2018-06-15 23:11:44
What? How did you get robbed? What platform? Also, I do not really understand what you are trying to say. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:39:22
Fees are high, some dude told me they had these bitcoin atm machines in Switzerland and fees are like 6&amp; 
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:14:45
Why bitcoin as a wedding gift though? They might end up in debt, you know how wives are! Lol. 
@_date: 2018-06-15 22:02:14
Not such a bad insight, meanwhile rate right now seems to be so bad, doesn't it? It's just my opinion, I guess it may be good to people who want to buy and invest but, really bad to people who wants to sell.. Keep hodl-ing!

Lots of users in the African continent use Paxful too, I think it's easier for them. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 07:46:57
Well, I think the African continent is their best selling point.

If i'm not mistaken there is some sort of rebate. I forgot if it was 15% but it can be 5%? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 07:52:36
Craziest analogy i've seen so far. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 08:36:22
I think Samourai wallet works pretty fine to be honest. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 07:22:24
True but, to correct you.. Paxful does not have an app, you likely downloaded a fake one which steals information. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 08:12:42
Cool, another dude that uses Paxful.. Bet you sending him a pm for the affiliate program :P 
@_date: 2018-07-31 10:04:35
Salty ass fuckers, I get it, you don't like Paxful but its there. Would you rather have Coinbase, an exchange basically held by US Sec, on the other hand, Paxful is a p2p platform wherein it is also part of the community. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:11:01
That's cool, and that's actually a good thing to be afraid off, falling behind, not because it's a trend or what but crypto is very revolutionary. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 06:57:31
Is this final? I recall a few months back they had problems with regulations and then later on accept or RBI is okay with crypto then rejects it again. It was pretty confusing news if you were to share it to friends, lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 11:57:16
Same mod! If I may ask, what would you do if bitcoin value drops to 1,500? My friends and I were talking about random scenarios like that and some of my friends would buy, one said he'd cry, lol! So what would you do? 
@_date: 2018-12-13 09:27:00
Well if you're looking for a platform BUT not an exchange why not try Paxful, has flexible payment methods and supports mainly bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:14:36
So it's like you are saying not to let your emotions get in the way?  Bitcoin value this year felt like a rollercoaster ride. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:34:13
Oh shit, I wonder why? Is it because he can't make up his mind?
