Yup. And January and February are the Monday and Tuesday of the year. Always slow. Every business is slow during these months. People are also taking money from their investments to pay bills and taxes. I don’t see recovery happening until March, when refunds come out and people want to spend money.

Lyme disease research! My mother in law lost her whole life and in debt due to a tick bite. Ticks have increased in population and are spreading Lyme changing peoples lives forever.  Health insurance isn’t even covering any of it. More research needs to happen so we can help people with Lyme live decent lives.

Last week twice on Overstock.com. It was actually easier than a credit card. In the hype that we could use bitcoin, we put in the wrong address by a number and had to cancel the order and place a new order with the right address. The refund took a couple days due to the holiday but customer service was prompt and easy to deal with. I would definitely do it again.

Overstock.com takes bitcoin directly and no fees! It was a great experience and super fast

What service is that?  I’ve heard about a private school in NYC that does this but I was curious as to what service they use
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:38:53
Don’t have bitmain, but it would get me to use it
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:54:44
Because they don’t care to get it 
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:00:53

She made jokes and then said "basically if you own Bitcoin you're going to be really really rich or totally broke. "
