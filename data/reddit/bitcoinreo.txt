This project could have HUGE mainstream potential if the right Bit-Angel takes notice of us waving our Bitcoin community ID card out there in the crowd off in the distance..  LOL
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:38:29
Exactly.. 
This story is one of 100's of reasons we are launching 'Bitcoin Gift Cards.." 
IE: 
10,000 "Bitcoin Gift Cards" into Walgreen's, Walmart's and Several Other Local Retail store fronts..

That is very very interesting..  
Not sure how the engineers can add that option..
But I bet there is a simple solution.. 
Interesting..

We set up 'sub/small' accounts for our field guys with their field ipads.. As the accounts are trackable, at the end of the day, we simply have each rep account forward coins to main account and print a daily report to match up.
Its 1x Ipad option...

Your absolutely correct.. Btcjam has been very very difficult to acquire funding sources as many have to go thru their sign-up steps.. 
But, all of this is a fairly new territory outside of real estate for us.. 
Kinda learning the hard way (**and friendly advice like yours.. ) the who is, what is and where is of the bitcoin community.. lol
We buy properties mostly, but we have a very creative group here and growing.. So, we are hoping soon some of the Bigger Boys (Bit Angels, Investors, VC's small/large) out there in the Bitcoin world start to realize we aren't that small anymore.. lol

I was watching that.. 
Was curious as to if anything in paticuliar was causing the downward trend..   ??
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:01:21
Yep..  Blockchain app is nice too. Have that as backup.. 
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:23:47
Just remember you have been warned..
Paypal is likely to freeze and suspend your paypal account for interacting with Bitcoins..   Paypal is highly against them
If you want to sell our btc's.. got to..   
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:00:14
Thats what we do as well.
Pretty simple.
1x-2x hour orientation with tenants and most get it easy,.
Just set them up with coinbase.com and you can send invoice for rent from bitpay or coinbase..

The card can be scanned via phone app ..
The QR code will launch an app the requires the pin code from the scratch off on the back side.. The app opens with scan/manual input (paste) for wallet receiving address to be filled in. THe QR code preloads a send address from from us, and awaits confirmation from user for receive address. Pin code is manually inputed and app confirms POS terminal transaction has been paid for.. Amount desired is confirmed by user, and 'receive' command is initiated.. Request to receive is processed by blockchain/coinbase as standard proceedure.
Does this help?

As I recall the story...
No-one even gave B.Gates the time of day(including the Exec's at TOP computer companies at the time) while he went door-to-door.. so, a small loan from his father, a garage, a workbench and wired pile of circuits from scratch computers..  and blam!! = &gt;&gt; 10years later, after a few companies "tested" windows.. Microsoft hits 60%-80% of every computer in the world.. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:53:40
At the time you/anyone scans the QR code and fills in the receive address and transmits the request to receive.. 
Could be 1hr after purchase or upto 1yr...  Whatever the current market price for BTC vs USD is at the time of app transmit.
Current market app is display in the app from 'fetch' command at the blockchain/coinbase market value.

Yes.. They can be scanned and the QR/Pin code can be redeemed online and Bitcoins sent to any receivers BTC wallet address.

We are a small fairly new to bitcoins(btc) start-up and doing our best to support all other bitcoin merchants. We welcome any tips, comments, referrals and advice. Any donations/investments always welcome. Thank you. Team 
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:33:01
Thats interesting reading..
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:59:31
Let me when you do..  I'll drop a graphic and link on my website for for free..  
I think this crypto-currency is gonna take the world by storm soon.. 
Forget the 1% we're at now..  Christ, imagine when we bitcoiner's as pioneers now see 10% + global acceptance..  Lol
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:32:05
Anyone know how long bitpay is gonna be down or what happened??
Its 1x of our merchant access for ipads.. 
Guess we could use coinbase..  Just curious.
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:26:38
Yes..  But simplifies buying BTC when many users dont want to input their checking accounts, or have a major credit card or just need to add BTC quickly to their wallets anonymously.. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:43:44
The price per BTC will is determined by blockchain/coinbase value at the time of initation for receive request..  
The load cost will be a standard $2.95 - $4.95..
Depending on the store purchased at.. 
If $100 is put on.. $100 conversion at the time of the request is sent will be valued as the same as buying $100 online..  
With 1x advantage..  No need for checking account, or ID as follows with Bitcoins anonymity..  Stores do however all limit amount to load is $300-$500 max per card depending on store.. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:58:02
I'll take a look at them..
Much appreciated!! Always luv good advice and ideas.. 
Thanks.. Rn
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:00:27
Exactly..  We use bitpay on site to collect for services thru Ipad, and collect rents on hand when need thru coinbase and bitpay.. Both provide instant invoice services for merchants.. Ipad on cellular works for merchants even if cant use wallet app.
@_date: 2014-03-17 23:58:32
Thanks..   We like to..
AND adds visabilty into local stores for Bitcoin marketing..
The more people 'see' the Bitcoin logo..  
The more 'we' pioneers of bitcoin merchants are going to see bitcoin exsposer explode.. 
Think how how many 'new' clients this will create for Bitcoin merchants everywhere.. ???  
New wallets, new buyers, etc... 
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:57:31
Tons and tons of advertiseing.. Walked a few thru in person, step-by-step thru coinbase and then they got excited.. Lol
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:19:32
We are hoping to get more "bitcoiner's" excited by this..
Not a cheap endevor..  Hoping we'll get some help/funding thru  to make this happen..   So, any up-posts, comments, shares and re-tweets within the bitcoin community would be greatly appreciated to have some funding come thru btcjam.com..  So, we're excited to talk, chat, and answer any questions for all.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:34:11
We buy REO auction real eatate properties, have them fixed with contractors that accept bitcoins, and tenants pay us in bitcoin for rent. So, yes, there are many advantages to using/accepting bitcoins in almost any market..
@_date: 2014-03-18 01:59:50
We already have the contracts/contacts with several local stores and retail outlets in place for a 'test market' batch of 10,000.
The card backers are being barcoded to store POS needs as per batch per store. We aren't launching 1,000,000 cards USA wide .. (well.. yet of course)
This is a real, contributed and 'going to happen" test market analysis in regards to "Bitcoin Gift Cards"..   Those who believe in early tests will have 1st positions when the 2nd phase is launched..  
Are you against 'testing' NEW untried methods to grow bitcoins?
Maybe no-one should have tried crypto-currency.. 
Inventors don't invent what is already invented, and dreamers dont dream up a $1,000,000 copied from someone else.. 
I suppose we should have stayed without needing windows in that philosophy..  and rallied against Microsoft being tried..
