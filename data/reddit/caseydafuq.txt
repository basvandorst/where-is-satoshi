Lol this man is a greedy dumbass that doesn't know when to cash out, CNN.
What the fuck is with CNN posting such Hot and Cold buzzword titles lmao. Make up your minds.

You're fucking stupid if you think a social structure based equitability causes that and not corrupt sociopathic dictators
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:36:56
This argument is a "Hasty generalization" a logical fallacy. Your argument is not valid or based on fact and reason.
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:39:46
You are just re-stating opinions, logical fallacy  so far
Ad hominem attack, strawman fallacy, either/or fallacy, ad populum fallacy, and red herring logical fallacies. All in the same post.
Your argument holds absolutely 0 water, try to learn how to argue pls
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:44:57
More ad hominem bullshit lmao, have fun supporting your oppressors, I'm out.
Bitcoin is capitalist, that is the only true statement you've made not based on emotion and lack of well thought out rational thinking/understanding.
@_date: 2018-09-10 21:35:43
Lmfao how can you compare providing medical care to a meth addiction... That's not even an argument. Slippery slope logical fallacy.
"They just have some mental diseases" how is this at all relevant... Red Herring logical fallacy.
The last part... its a begging the claim, another logical falacy.
China has some capitalist sectors, what's your point?
You're not making any logical statements. "If the market would address it"
An invisible nonexistance hand of justice that preveneted all of the current complete monopolization that's taking billions of dollars in business tax breaks that have absolutely no benefit on education and healthcare ability? Hasn't done so in 50 years?
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:11:52
Really? Because for the past 70 years we have literally been making shit up to create new enemies. Oh no WMD'S! OH NO SOCIALISM! OH NO VIETCONG! OH NO IMMIGRANTS! It works flawlessly due to political amnesia.
People are dumb enough to keep falling for it, and growing more complacent, fearful, and overly-misinformed by the day.
@_date: 2018-09-10 22:47:56
“Monopolism” is a corruption of healthy free market principles. It is a corrupt form of Capitalism. 
The state basically gives small business owners startup funds that aren't predatory under socialism, after taking the reigns of production into working class control.
That is the exact opposite of corporations  getting 1.5tn of taxpayer dollars because the "free market" allows them to exploit the system. They pay lobbyists to pass laws that restructure workers rights. Workers have no rights. Unions protecting workers and businesses are destroyed. That's a monopoly. A corrupt capitalist monopoly.

Are you even reading what you're typing? Megacorporations, today, 2018, capitalist corporations, come from socialism? Please tell me more.
Bruh are you even fucking reading this? "Capitalism is when WORKERS control "MEANS OF PRODUCTION" THAT IS THE LITERAL DEFINITION OF SOCIALISM. 
WORKERS DON'T OWN SHIT IN AMERICA, THEY HAVE NO RIGHTS. THEY WORK FOR PRIVATE MONOPOLIES LMAO.
Your circular argument is yet one of many bad logic indicators and infactual statements. Please learn methods of effectively arguing your point, if everything you're saying is either false, or not supporting logical argument, your argument is invalid once again
You can't just go around making up definitions of words that already exist, that's why we have language and dictionaries.
@_date: 2018-09-26 09:00:40
Lmao what a stupid argument....
None of those countries had the capabilities to destroy the entire Earth with nuclear fallout. None of them had a massive police state AND permanent economic means to keep their power in place.

Lmao you drank the koolaid. Go back to The_Donald
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:22:34
Do you even understand what healthy marketing principles are lmao...
You're just making shit up, burden of proof is in your hands still.
We have the largest globalized corporations that are based in where? America. Grown out of control under capitalism. Forcing people onto public assistance while shareholders buy another $300million yacht they got from other people's work.
@_date: 2018-09-27 04:38:33
Seems like a perfect setup considering the timing of scarcity development and increase in publicity and acceptance within government

Nah he got something like $11k fiat, back in December. 
Does that make him profit? Smartass.
I could buy 200 million Bolivars but they're fucking worthless. Does that mean it's not money?
Does manipulating the question to something a 5 year old would ask constitute a valid argument?
@_date: 2018-08-31 03:50:38
What the fuck...
I bought a $4k car from my brother with Crypto....
I think the xfer fee was $9 total.
@_date: 2018-08-17 08:59:15
Exctinction? Lmao
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:36:55
Oh I'm sure it will eventually

Binance lets you use "market orders" to completely bypass the 0.01 ETH minimums, and you can now press a single button to transfer all of your dust to BNB
@_date: 2018-05-09 09:11:38

Lmao this turtle can't even see a fucking computer screen, what does his old ABC loving ass know?

They're worth it for whoever owns that ATM lol.
That's how all ATMs work. They just sneak a percent here and there, since you want convenience, you'll pay.
I don't think there would be a reason to pay an extra $1300 for btc in any situation really.... That's why nobody uses CoinBase any more. It's not more convenient in any situation I can think of... Its a way for big investors to rob the little guy legally.
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:36:12
Maybe not $1300... but still $70 higher on ETH... 
I can simply use Gemini for like $3.50 And wait a couple days, since it'll be a long term plan anyways. Crypto isn't a get rich quick setup for low dollar investors.
@_date: 2018-10-03 06:29:54
Most of the people that support blockchain still don't understand it lol
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:00:29
It looks cool and it's only $5?
@_date: 2018-11-06 10:42:23
I really doubt that .... do you have proof?
Obviously not 2.8 mil dollars, bets, unique users, or no-life excludes
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:33:15
They also use multi accounts to promote Reddit content
@_date: 2018-12-11 09:30:21
They probably want to drive up fee income for transactions to wallets
