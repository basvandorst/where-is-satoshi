Yes, that's the path I'm trying to follow. Thanks sir

I imagine that was only the tipping point. We never really understood each other

No coins left. But still what would you suggest?

Thank you

True. It's the first thing I must and will do if the situation will ever unblock. Please anyone not using an own wallet,  just do it now

Cannot actually find a flaw in your reasoning..

As you should not trust anyone if the private key is involved (including myself!) you could then proceed something like this. Get some Linux distribution live cd. Turn off your pc and run the distribution in demo mode. Install only java. Disconnect your network cable from the pc. Run the program, which will ask you for the needed info (how long it will run depends on the number of missing places). The program should be able to find the missing characters. Turn off the pc. Reconnect the network. That should be reasonably safe in the case I am malicious (which I am not) or in case you have some hidden malware on your computer (which you normally cannot exclude)

Well, you made me laugh. Thanks

I could write a small java program to do that if you want, for free. I think I understood your problem and I don't need any further info. I can do it when I am back home from work. Let me know if you are interested.

Ok. Just drop a message in case.
