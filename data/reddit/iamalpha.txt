I'm really trying to avoid being a dick here, but what part of fiscal responsibility don't you understand? We're not here to fuck around, we're here to responsibly invest

ELI5 the situation: if this is what bitcoiners consider serious trading, it's going to be a LONG time until anyone serious enters the market in a serious way

I've personally been in bitcoin for some time now. Believe me, I know this thing is going to change the world, one way or another. 
But I can't truthfully disagree with him at this point. There's over 6 major global exchanges and only two of them have FIX APIs. The market structure is practically nonexistent. We want some prime brokerage, or SIPC insurance, i don't care. just something to mitigate all this goddamn risk

it's a waste of time and money. we're not here to educate people on how to properly manage other people's money.
this is exactly what I mean... this isn't a game guys, when we're talking about billions of dollars in turnover a month for a fund with a fiscal obligation to investors we can't seriously discuss trading something where this is considered front page news. 
but maybe bitcoin just isn't ready for the big leagues yet

hubris is reserved for those who've earned it... the entire market cap of bitcoin is a fraction of the daily turnover of a single major securities exchange. don't even get me started on the fx markets.
perhaps if we spent less time laughing at wall street and more time learning we would have exchanges we could actually feel comfortable with, and more developed financial 2.0 capabilites
