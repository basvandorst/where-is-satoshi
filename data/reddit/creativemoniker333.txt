It's a small enough amount where you can go to a bitcoin ATM and get what you need.  This will probably be the most hassle free and quickest option.
[Find the nearest machine using this website](
You are also going to need a mobile wallet, Mycelium should be fine.  Find this on Play store or Apple store and install it.
Contrary to what most here are saying, I believe there is a good chance you will get your files back if you pay.  They have nothing to gain by not giving you your files.  It would only hurt their credibility and if no one gets their files back after paying, no one would pay.  It is in their best interest to follow through with their end of the bargain.
Yes, there is a *possibility* you won't get them back but what other option do you have? If you don't pay, you definitely won't get your files.  If I had 10 years of files lost and the only possibility of getting them back would cost me $150, I would do it.  If I didn't get them back I would know I atleast tried.
$150 is very cheap for this type of attack, they have you by the balls and could ask any amount they want.  It could be worse, next time keep offline backups.
Wish you the best, feel free to PM me if you have questions
Edit - Currently the fee market for bitcoin is rather irrational, I would make sure you get about $175 just incase mycelium calculates a ridiculous fee (there are wallets that will let you calculate fees and set them manually, but if you are new and in a hurry just pay the premium imo).

Nah, it's really not.  It was open source and available for anyone to participate from the very beginning.  Anyone had a chance to participate whether they did or not.  
A premine is a circle jerk saying "we're going to make this super sweet coin, but were gonna take 5mil before anyone else is allowed to join...oh and we will dump them into the market when people start buying 'cause dev fees and stuff."

He didn't specify how many bitcoins it was.. If it was 10 bitcoins I think being concerned is very rational.  iPhone takes a picture and it saves it to the cloud.  Account could be compromised and restored from backup.. Crazier things have happened for $150k.. Will it happen, probably not.  Is it possible it is compromised, yes.

If you are claiming bitcoin is a premine because CNBC didn't blast it all over the MSM you are delusional.
How would you ever envision cryptographic currency to be launched in any other way?  It was pure perfection to the highest degree.  No pre-mine.

LN whitepaper calculated it would require 8GB blocks to scale the size of Visa.
BTC is banking on LN as a solution, BCH is banking on Moore's Law as a solution.  Everyone complaining about congestion needs to have patience, scaling solutions are underway but to rush them would be irresponsible.  We are talking about a $200billion+ mistake here.  ETH is neat but they are reckless with their implementations and have had to hard fork due to the barely tested DAO, I'm glad BTC doesn't rush anything and does it right the first time.  If you are here to get rich quick, I'm glad the network is congested and you think it's going to fail. Let those weak hands lose their grip and pass it off to people who's knees don't start to tremble on a 10% dip. Give it back to the people who originally came here for the revolutionary technology, to people who's vision has always been further than 3 months.

BTC does need to increase block size to scale with global payments even with LN. LN whitepaper says it would require 133MB blocks for every person in the world to open 2 channels/yr.  I'm guessing that it will happen eventually once LN has proven itself as a justifiable reason to increase the size

I can tell you this certainly does not feel the same as in the past.  
2014 there was no reassurance what so ever that Bitcoin was going to be around for another 5 years.  Everything that could go wrong was going wrong.  Mainstream media coverage was almost non existent, if it was covered it was almost always negative.  Pretty much the only big names involved were the Winklevoss.  Even though we all believed in the tech, there was always that possibility it didn't matter.
What is the same is the coordinated FUD that comes with **every** single drop.  Whether its people who missed the boat and scream its a bubble, needing to reassure themselves of their claims, or a coordinated effort to manipulate the price we may never know.  But its always there.  Bitcoin has been at the front lines of this battle from the very beginning and all alts riding its coat tails letting bitcoin eat the bullets.  It's the same.
This time though, we have established roots in the current financial system.  Stamps of approval of its validity that its here to stay.  CME, CBOE, Nasdaq on board.  Square on board, big players putting their name on the line.  Lightning network in the works, Rootstock released.  We have big releases around the corner.
Stay strong, it's the name of the game.  When you chose to buy bitcoin you enlisted in the bloodiest battle of psychological warfare we will see in our lifetimes.

Do times like these suck?  Sure.  Have we had countless times like this before? Absolutely.
Edit - adding this just in case you haven't seen it before.  There is a website that tracks when a news source has claimed [bitcoin is dead]( over the years... 249 times as of this post.  First article starts when bitcoin was $0.23.

We joke about using a USB or PS/2 but shit even most bluetooth mice have the ability to copy/paste across PC's. Security is becoming more of a concern than just the PC itself and into the devices connected to it.

Awesome, great work!

Hmm..what do you want to do with the data once it's in excel?
If you just want it into excel the link the other person posted may be a better option..If you want to manipulate the data, Python will give much more options
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:41:55
This is why you never want to throw away old keys.  Great website content, thanks for sharing it
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:37:45
*yawn* ...you FUDsters have been using the same tactic for the last 4 years.  Time for something new if you're going to shake any real hodlers.

It may be a lot of json data for excel, are you able to parse it in Python?
@_date: 2019-09-20 17:44:21
If I offered you $0.25 per post would you do it?

Another thing most users don't think of are wireless keyboards.  You can have an offline PC running Tails with a hand written seed from electrum.  Even though your PC is offline, your keystrokes could be picked up within a short distance.
I mean the chances of some guy standing outside of your window sniffing your wireless keyboard strokes is pretty slim but just another "well it's theoretically possible" scenario.
@_date: 2018-07-31 13:01:07
Ah yes you are correct, didn't see that it was BIP38
@_date: 2018-07-31 11:04:27
You can create a watch only wallet from Electrum seed and tranfer to an online PC without ever exposing your private keys.  Same with signing offline transactions.

Since btc isn't some premine scam coin, the only way they can accumulate is with psychological warfare.  Been going on for years, the battle hardened veterans haven't even shed a drop of sweat with this orchestrated dump.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:42:24
Yep, I'm way more hesitant of sustainability when everyone is euphoric.  Bitcoin **always** corrects and the FUD comes in swarms, then in the blink of an eye were at an ATH and no FUDsters to be seen anywhere.. The cycle starts over again
@_date: 2017-10-05 16:35:20
Maybe, but all these talks about bitcoin in the news is the same questions over and over and over.  "...b-but but my fiat is backed by the faith of the US government, what backs bitcoin?"  Have them take 20 minutes to read about bitcoin before coming on and doing an interview with 0 knowledge of the subject at hand..
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:04:22
So you actually think they will activate an internet "kill switch" to stop bitcoin....?  If that's your only argument to stopping it then it's already won..sorry you missed the train old timer
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:33:29
Step 1: Drive market down
Step 2: Load up long btc futures
Step 3: ??????
Step 4: Profit

Back in 2010 he could have had 1000btc worth $30..Of course we can look back now and see the value of properly securing it but at the time it was probably treated as keeping track of $30. So I think if OP's claim is true, he deserves to be cut some slack.
I bet many btc casino's are full of accounts with 0.1 btc because at the time it wasn't worth reclaiming that dust and the credentials are long forgotten.

If you created a paper wallet you don't need the wallet password. You can regenerate it via your seed or private key written down on paper.
@_date: 2018-07-17 22:14:21
That's what happens when you buy just to speculate on price and not the technology. RIP
@_date: 2018-07-31 15:13:14
Yes, ultimately the most secure method is with a PC that never has or never will touch the internet.  I think booting offline to Tails on a DVD simulates an air gap okay. Then restart to Tails/online to broadcast signed tx's etc

Thanks for consistently posting these.

You got it.. Bear market too long and people become numb to the red.  Launch it every once in a while to give everyone a glimpse of green, snatch it away and the red feels bad again.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:47:14
Ehhh..Crypto is definitely a manipulated market..Green or red, doesn't matter.

Fair point, although there is a type of mindset I am willing to invest my time into, and one I am not.  There is  "I don't understand this, will you explain it to me?" and there is "This is X, change my mind."
If someone is searching for an understanding with an open mind I will teach them, I will not try to convert.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:46:54
Ah shit, here we go again.

Why not just withdraw less than 78k/yr if married filing jointly?  That is 0% tax long term capital gains.  [(In the US)](
Edit: This is also assuming that is your only income.
@_date: 2019-05-15 17:50:05
We're not here to open their eyes for them.  If they don't see the potential in Bitcoin that is their own problem.  Ship is setting sail whether they are on it or not.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:24:35
Sure, if that is your only income for the year.  I am not an accountant though so please fact check me before you quit your job and live off capital gains.
@_date: 2019-05-21 15:40:04
I was not aware of that, thank you for pointing that out.  I would think it would still work for signing offline transactions though?
@_date: 2019-05-16 21:24:41
Excuse me sir but it is used for the knees.  We want to extract information, not cause amnesia.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:42:39
Network != Market
I think you are confusing the USD/BTC price with bitcoin network security.
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:22:52
This is correct/great advice.  I would just like to add that the offline computer can be accessed using Tails OS for added security and convenience as it comes packaged with Electrum
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:28:14
Tell them that if they buy some, you can sell for a profit and then if they get 10 other people to do the same they can also profit.
For real though, we are past the stage of trying to convince people of the potential.  Some people just won't/don't want to open their eyes.  They have their preconceived notion and they are going to stick with it.  Tough titties, their loss.
