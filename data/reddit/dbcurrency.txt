Agreed. This is exactly why we accept Bitcoin, Monero and plan to add other crytocurrencies.  
  
This isn't an issue with my receiving bank, but rather the default payment processor provided by Shopify. Very interesting to see their process may be to search each new site for the term Bitcoin and flag a hold!

The **Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency market** is fueled by price. When *Bitcoin is booming* we see it all over media. When *Bitcoin is busting* we see it all over media. I think we can all agree the fluctuations in price spike the attention of the masses.  
  
However, **what we should really be focusing on** now, and in the years to come, is the *technology*. Can you answer the question: What is Bitcoin?  
  
We **need to be prepared** to answer these simple questions and provide resources for others to take a deeper dive into Blockchain technology.  
  
I’ve pulled some information from [Jameson Lopp's Site]( and tried to simplify the **first question you’ll get** about Bitcoin.  
  
As people begin to ask you more questions about Bitcoin and cryptocurrency **please direct them to resources** like this from [What the Block?]( and certainly to Jameson Lopp’s site for a deeper dive into Bitcoin.

Very true. This is being molded as a resource for newcomers. I can get in there and cut it down to only a few. But as I'm sure you are aware everyone has an opinion on exchanges so I wanted to provide options.
Good thing I have a post coming up in 2 weeks about exchanges and how to get into trading.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:08:12
This is what I don't understand. Shopify has a dedicated page promoting the acceptance of Bitcoin as payment. However, the letter is telling me I need to take down anything on the site that is referenced to Bitcoin.  
  
Most specifically the two shirts that pop up when searching "Bitcoin" in the store. I'd like to think they can't tell me to take down my blog posts too.
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:31:12
*I'm still waiting for a response* so we'll see where it goes from there. But, can they really stop me from selling a shirt that says "Honey Badger".  
  
**More of a reason to push people towards paying with Bitcoin and Monero** rather than CC. I guess Paypal is still a viable option.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:25:53
Good point. [Locations have been updated here](  
  
Thanks and any other suggestions welcome!
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:56:48
No I don't mind. Only started selling about two weeks ago with the blog live for several more weeks. Saw a great response from the r/NEO community and another decent batch of sales from r/Stellar.  
  
I haven't advertised it and only did a few posts in those communities where I'm most active. Got my first re-order yesterday which was pretty awesome for only 2 weeks in!  
  
Selling apparel isn't easy at all and I don't want to spam people with my products. I'm really hoping to put out some good content on the blog and grow organically with the crypto community. 
  
I made the first shirts for myself and thought other people would want them too! Had to drop the money on an expensive heat press, but I like the idea of doing it myself rather than farming it out to a third party. Hope you like it!

What do you think?
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:45:39
Thanks for the appreciation! Now if anyone asks you can quickly send them to this info.
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:31:05
I'm going to wait and see what kind of reply I get. I knew I'd run into issues by starting a business around crypto, but didn't think it would happen so soon! I'm ready to fight the good fight though.
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:09:46
Great point! This has been [updated](
Sound good? Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:00:21
Good point. [Updated]( and went ahead and added "Private Key" too.

Thanks for this little nugget! The original "Coinbase" is under Exchanges to not be confused with the Coinbase I have now added from your suggestion. Check it out and let me know if you have any others to add.

I've gone ahead and [made updates to the website](

You are absolutely correct. [Updated](  
  
@_date: 2018-01-25 14:44:21
I think you're exactly right. Seemed like a generic message for a search of the term "Bitcoin".
@_date: 2018-01-15 22:17:33
Seeing this now. Thanks
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:09:02
True. Was still getting orders yesterday and no issues pulling funds from Paypal. Battle now is getting them to release the funds made with credit card payments through their processor. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:03:08
For newcomers confused about **Bitcoin &amp; CryptoTerminology** I put together a [blog post]( and also [posted on r/cryptocurrency]( to hopefully help some people out.  
  
Please *upvote, share, or add to the list* so we can spread some crypto knowledge!
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:23:59
Very true, thanks for the feedback! Trying to keep this as simple as possible for newcomers considering any and all of the terms can go into much greater detail.  
Send over your short form suggestions for Fork, Bear and Bull and I'll make some adjustments.
Updates from the community highly appreciated!
@_date: 2018-01-25 15:29:03
Yea for sure! Well can't say it's all myself... wife helps press the shirts too :P
Nice. Use code **REDDIT** and you can grab any shirt for $15  
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:13:15
Good Luck! Tried watching it with my wife and so far after 3 attempts I still haven't had a chance to finish it. Her response is "If you want a crypto budget I get the same for a home decor budget"...
@_date: 2017-08-22 13:15:22
Started it a few times and haven't been able to finish. Tried watching it with the wife and I'm not sure if that was better or worse for my crypto budget...
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:10:42
Doing the same here!
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:09:09
I’ve recently opened up accepting BTC, ETH, LTC and Monero on my storefront [Blockchain Shop]( and have decided to not immediately convert crypto payments. Safe to say I’m taking a hit since opening up the option in January.
However, I truly believe in the long term and hope the fiat payments can cover the loss in value for the time being. Not to say I don’t get excited every time I see a customer choosing to pay with crypto!
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:42:03
Or just don’t look at your phone while driving. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 14:57:11
PSA: Don't check crypto while driving.
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:30:32
And actually only for 5 states and a limited number of participants to start. BUT, this will expand throughout the US and open doors for crypto as a whole! I'd say it's kind of a big deal.
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:32:31
Exposure is always good, but spread some knowledge in the comments of social media posts like this or anytime mass media chimes in.
Feel free to share this resource:

Ha, It just went live 2 hours ago... whew crypto moves fast!
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:12:51
Hmm I have a shop that accepts crypto and would much rather be paid in BTC than fiat right now!
