ExtBlocks do prevent covert Asicboost 
Now, help me understand, why is Bitmain supporting solutions that prevent Asicboost, including a proposal with SegWit, if the reason to not accept only SegWit softfork is because of Asicboost. It makes no sense and saying is to make noise is handwave-y.

Let's roll with this, so why did Bitmain supported SegWit2Mb then?
Even more, why does Bitmain support ExtBlocks, that also blocks covert asicboost?

Why did Core refused to fix covert asicboost when proposed months ago, to then have Maxwell make it the forefront of the scaling debate the next day ExtBlocks was proposed?

He does not answer to the claim that the proposed solution makes asicboost economically not profitable, basically killing it.
And if the issue is so important and the proposed solution was not of the liking of lukejr, why ignore it instead of proposing a different one.
Yet, when ExtBlocks was proposed, the next day it became the no1 issue.

Im saying its being used politicalky when it clearly wasnt a priority.

I would have liked an answer as to why this subreddit is so convinced that Jihan is blocking SegWit because of Asicboost when it makes no sense. Bitmain even said in their blog post that they would accept blocking covert Asicboost.
Answering your question, Jihan did not support XP or Classic or even Unlimited at the start. He in fact supported the HK agreement in which Core devs and the president of Blockstream agreed to SegWit and 2Mb. Once the schedule for that agreement was over and was clear that Core was not going to honor the agreement, he felt fooled by Core and Blockstream (justifiably so IMO) and he supported the next more popular client. It is clear that at this point the battle is political and not technical. I still do not understand why Core does not offer an exit to Bitmain that allows them to keep their dignity in the form of SegWit2Mb or even ExtBlocks since it has everything Core says is needed technically. It would also satisfy most of the community and end the division. But, for some reason I don't really understand, Maxwell is determined to get SegWit softfork only or nothing.
And since Bitmain is determined to not let Core and Blockstream steamroll and fool the rest of the Bitcoin companies and get away with it, here we are stuck.

I never implied it should not be solved, thats not the point we are discussing.
