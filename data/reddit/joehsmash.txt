Sorry for the noobish question as I'm just getting into btc, 
But is mbtc just the fractions of bit coins? Or is it something completely new? 
When you say for noobs to buy mbtc, is that just a troll?
Sorry for the stupid question

So by saying it's "cheap" it's just a subjective in a way, cuz  a whole btc is 3300, vs a mili which is 3.30

Your the best!

Nice! I clearly wasn’t aware of this!

Yes I guess it is, but, Coinbase isn’t holding your fiat.
You still need to transfer fiat to coinbase to buy btc.

The benefit could be tailored to the crypto community. 
Seems one out of every 10 posts I’m seeing lately is how banks in the US are closing accounts, or blocking funds

Sure, I 100% agree with you. There is lots to consider that’s for sure. Would you not see the value in having all currency under one roof?
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:13:20
Is this an unintentional shit post? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 04:27:19
Sure, this could be a way to do it, but why separate them? Why not how crypto and fiat under the same roof?
