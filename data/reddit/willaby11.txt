I've done a ton of business with CoinMKT and I always get paid

I wonder if someone could find out where that alleged 744,000 went... Either there's one rich mofo out there, or it's bullshit

I wonder if there's a way the Bitcoin community can 'agree' with 51% to seize them :)

Everyone get their hopes up and rush back and start trading on Mt. Gox again!!!
You should have switched to [CoinMKT]( a long time ago...

Ron Paul is the coolest.

Trade on [CoinMKT]( 100% legit
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:20:41
I agree, right now free trades on CoinMKT too

They're back up for me!

They're probably running a business to make money, don't you think? I don't mind the fees if the volume is there

I've been able to trade a good amount of BTC there so far, and the instant withdrawal via Dwolla is nice.
If you've got BTC for a price comparable to say Bitstamp they can move them really fast, if you're trying to sell higher like around Mt. Gox prices the orders might be open for a while.

They are super-friendly Bitcoin now with that huge stockpile they're sitting on.

Volume is getting way better on [CoinMKT]( but it still needs more sellers. I was able to easily dump there and get USD out on 'silk road day'. They're mostly US customers at this point.
