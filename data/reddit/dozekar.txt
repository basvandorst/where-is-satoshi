Both ruling parties ARE the banks and military industrial complex.  The army is just the people who carry the guns around, they're really not much a part of this.  The scary shit are the pmc's and the banks.

Yeah unless you want to get government tortured while being surveilled in a Chicago black site by militarized police in covert then systematically incarcerated and shot by police when you get out, you don't say things too loud or to against this.  We aren't this way by choice.  This fear is what got Trump elected, it was just poorly directed and funneled into someone who will make it worse.  The fear is real and legitimate.  [The US government has been caught actively acting in this manner against their citizens]( and snowden and manning, whatever you think about their shitty reasons are good examples of what the government will do to you if you participate in any way that doesn't support them.
I hate supporting the russian "democracy is broken in the US narrative", but they're fucking right.
Bitcoin was made to resist all of this tampering and control though, and that's why people hate it so badly in the US government.

civil asset forfeiture also relies on the ability to actually take the assets.

No, they can't use that information they dig up in court.  Nothing protects you from forfeiture on the side of the road.  If they never intend to use it in court, they've got a loophole through the whole system.
