I did check all my wallets from 2011-2012 the first time I heard of bitcoin. And all my wallets from 2013+ when I started to get into it. Damn my younger me, I was too careful with all my bitcoins and all my balances showed 0 with a transaction history in the millions $$$... 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:46:05
"technologically obsolete" while LN is on mainnet, yeah right...
cause changing 1 line of code is technologically more advanced than 1000's of hours of development on something much more efficient...

Block fees should replace mining rewards... Therefore it's also a bit necessary to have slighter bigger blocks so more transactions fit in. If the fee market is balanced and cheap enough to do on-chain transactions, but there are enough transactions in each block with a decent fee the reward is not necessary anymore. But this is an ideal situation
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:36:49
Why the relation between these two events?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:47:00
It is, and it does feel good. Although that I sold all my bitcoins at $400 because I was so tired of the blocksize debate and called it quits...
$30 could be a hundred by next year, and maybe much more in the long term. You should just add little by little to the stack you have, without putting in to much so you don't get in an awkward financial situation.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:21
This is going to fast for my eyes

BTC doesn't care
@_date: 2017-12-21 13:00:15
I don't completely agree with this. Coinbase is also an exchange to get bitcoins. It is much easier to do than localbitcoins for example. Yes, storing bitcoins shouldn't be done on Coinbase.
For Bitpay, as long as bitcoin hasn't succeeded as a peer to peer network, we need companies like Bitpay to facilitate an easy to use payment process. Remember, bitpay lets you choose whether to convert to fiat or keep your bitcoins. Their integration for accepting bitcoins on your website is great and works perfectly as it should be. I don't think we should be bashing them as much as we do.

Would recommend Xamarin more.
I'd also look into using C++ as the base code. It is supported on both platforms, and is a lot faster than React-Native
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:08:32
Every year has been a very interesting year for bitcoin IMO

I always say to my rels that bitcoin and the common media is not a good mix. Complete bogus articles with very wrong info all the time. I say to them to never believe what they write, and instead ask me if they are interested in the real story behind it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:19
@_date: 2018-09-16 17:08:32
Actually in a way it is. Based on these numbers bitcoin is by far the most efficient. And it’s only getting more efficient when newer gear comes on the market.
Did you expect something like bitcoin to use no energy at all? If that were possible, yes it would be even better to go that way, but until then it’s good the way it is.
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:51:55
the client that can not be named here... (:
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:41:47
This is a good tutorial, but make sure you clone the latest version of bitcoin from github.
Also consider looking into different clients, if you know what I'm talking about (;

It's also bogus saying in his stance that it's purpose is not for buying coffee. Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. But he was definitely not in favor of keeping the blocksize at 1MB fixed and letting fees grow this high.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:39:30
put a node on them too
@_date: 2015-06-13 21:57:15
let me check that, I have 1GB, and 512MB vSwap
EDIT: Nope, the log file is empty
@_date: 2015-06-13 15:48:45
Same problem, but I do get a log in the debug.log file. it says:
























I'm running a script every minute via crontab that checks if bitcoind is running, and if not, restarting it
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:07:42
The screen bugged! after my bitcoins I've sent ran out the screen started showing weird stuff.
Btw, veel succes in Parijs gasten! Ik duim!

If they don't want it to be used like silk road. It sure comes to that.
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:29:45
What if you just pumped bitcoin really fast in such a country where the local currency fails so hard. The adoption would be immense, and everyone who has questions could turn to their own neighbour
@_date: 2015-06-21 13:29:53
In Belgium, there is an ISP already delivering a theoretical download speed of 200Mb/s, today, on wifi, I get a practical speed of 100 to 150Mb/s, meaning these numbers are really feasable on 2036 for 8GB blocks, I say do it...
@_date: 2018-09-13 13:43:46
You can always run the btc node on another port, and forward that one. 8333 is just default but not necessary to use that one

I've just set up a node on a VPS. Let's see what happens
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:04:10
Ofcourse, it is a big decision not being made lightly. I'm just pointing out that full blocks are around the corner. Even if blocks are getting full, it is not a complete disaster to bitcoin
@_date: 2015-06-01 09:06:26
When the hard fork happens, we need a really good management, and director to do this. Maybe some team should be put together to make sure everything goes as planned (making sure big exchanges join the new fork etc)
@_date: 2015-06-12 18:55:36
Well, as everyone knows 512MB RAM isn't enough, it's $20/year for that, so you actually have to count it at $45-50.
I've set one up today at that host, went pretty smooth, but having some trouble now because the server is rebooting quite often, but bitcoind is starting up automatically. I think this is because even 1MB isn't that much...
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:32:42
plot twist: block sizes have also silently been raised. and everyone supports it without even knowing :p
@_date: 2015-06-12 09:26:20

Thanx man! That is more than 2 months server time now!

@_date: 2015-06-11 18:29:28
Didn't know he was planning on launching more. But just imagine if someone could talk the guys in to adding nodes on those sats, 4000 nodes in space, and everyone could access them, and vote whether to update to which version. The entire problem of too few nodes would be history
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:24:49
Why didn't we riot?
@_date: 2015-06-11 16:19:08
Indeed it is, but he's only planning on launching 8 sats. Not 4000

I thought when I started watching the video I was going to hear that bitcoin isn't interesting at all, but indeed they close off saying that every country should at least try to experiment using crypto-currency, especially greeks in these days where they face to abandon the euro.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:30:57
I recently bought a RPi2 for a node, but I'm still waiting for my SD card. Will be up in two weeks^tm
@_date: 2015-06-12 11:53:51
I'll keep track of all the tips I get. But it would need some more publicity I guess. If I can get $4 I'll start up the VPS, and give a PoW
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:38:43
I thought this is a way better move than giving it a fixed size, it could just create the same problem. Always try to avoid fixed code
@_date: 2015-06-21 14:19:57
Nope, it's not screening here in Belgium, I am looking forward to seeing it, but I probably won't be able to see it in theaters payed with bitcoin...

about the same here, also a student
@_date: 2015-06-04 07:50:17
As to the point you don't know what a block or a node is, **YOU DON'T HAVE TO!**
More than 90% of the people who use banks don't know what's under their hood either. Or how their systems work, from money printing to online bank servers and services. It just works. More people need to understand this

What? It's a complete copy of Reddit? So why is it better?
@_date: 2015-06-15 22:07:19
little update:
After the blockchain completely synced, the crashes of bitcoind stopped. Which makes me think that the problem is on running bitcoind on low hardware specs.
Why hasn't anyone made a version of the Bitcoin protocol that acts as a node especially for machines with very limited hardware? Is this possible? I can imagine there are improvements to bitcoind to run on those machines
@_date: 2015-06-12 15:13:23

At 14 connections now. downloading the blockchain.

We could crowd fund something like this. I would be happy to set these up and maintain them. If a lot of people on here would tip a few cents each, it wouldn't really cost a lot (:

It is 100GB hdd and 1GB RAM, what did you expect? 
@_date: 2015-06-25 21:20:15
There is a somewhat less UX friendly way to do this, you can set the max connections to your node in the bitcoin.conf file. This doesn't really limit the bandwidth in a fixed way, but this can control it more or less. But it definitely wouldn't hurt at all to implement this into the core. It sounds like a good idea
@_date: 2015-06-12 13:41:17
3 different? I'm sure that if you find a good VPS, they won't ban you for this. Maybe go up in the price range a little bit
@_date: 2015-06-04 21:16:06
I'm a programmer, not an engineer, but I think I get it (:
A quick solution would be to twist the lcd wires right, if you can do that?
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:18:06
If they will run a full node on it they indeed need way bigger storage. I don’t see this happening and that’s why I put a question mark behind the full.
Perhaps in a few years we’ll have 1TB phones specifically for dapps.

Could be, the SeedInput.json file is the input for the seed generator
I was implementing blockchain.info's api to check if the address had been used.
Next steps would be to implement filters based on clues
@_date: 2014-12-13 13:23:06
Same here! I love the simplicity of it too
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:48:38
Hate to be "that guy", but some of us prefer consoles. Like me, I have a Mac, and yes we all know Mac isn't the best for gaming, so a console sounds pretty good
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:59:51
It only gives output if it found the seed to the public key provided in the post with 1BTC in
Again it needs more input or you could leave it running for a thousand years without finding the correct answer

Gotta love Gilfoyle
@_date: 2018-08-21 09:22:15
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:37:01
It only checks the first index address, with derived path "m/0'/0/0"
I must say I actually have no idea what I'm doing here. It's a very very long shot.
Edit: it should work now with the generator you used.
@_date: 2018-05-28 11:27:38
Almost no one uses bitcoin anywhere in the world. That's why we are still in a very early phase of adoption.
If this is a true story, this only shows that these kind of use cases are amazing for this type of economy, it brings wealth to the poor. Even if they'd still have to convert their mined BTC's to USD or any other non hyper-inflated currency and can pay their groceries with it, great! Let em have it, they deserve it
@_date: 2014-12-16 11:27:48
Sure thing!

True, I'm with Mobile Vikings and used Bitcoin to top up my phone.
Also, the guys who placed this atm are working on a Bitcoin Boulevard project too! So when they start this project, hopefully, Ghent will have many shops that accept Bitcoin. So yeah, you could say that Belgium would be turning into a Bitcoin country if they succeed. And hopefully, many other shops will follow if they see that it works

Could also be that Xapo's system is not yet compatible with online purchases...
@_date: 2014-12-24 15:40:53
Well, living next to france made the shipping costs way better, although they were still pretty much. In comparison for the Trezor, for me with shipping, it would cost double the price of the Ledger (:

Electronic paying will likely become more expensive in our country (Belgium). That's what organisations like Comeos, Horeca Flanders, Test-Purchase (Belgian consumers federation), UCM and UNIZO are warning for. On Wednesday there will be negotiations on European level about the fees that may be charged for electronic paying, which would lead to a price increase.

You can safely use the ledger wallet on any computer you want, just install the chrome app and plug in the usb. They also say it's safe on every machine, whether it is compromised with viruses or malwares. Hackers won't get a hold of your private keys (:

Takes a lot of time when it comes to setting up all those wallets, I think buying pizza's as an example is good enough. Maybe even thinking of buying some coins on Circle.com and using them to buy the pizzas

I was planning to do so, thanx for the tip (:

Our laws were very old school regarding E-shops in the beginnings, that's why the dutch have a lot of internet shops, and Belgium doesn't. For example, our E-shops didn't have permission to give sales until 12th april 2010. Can you imagine how late that was? :p

Hmm well, since it's kinda unlikely that someone could ever steal the paper, I don't think it will be necessary (:
Maybe I'll do it later and print the paper again, move the coins to the encrypted wallet..

in the SeedInput.json file, yes.
But this app only checks for a specific version of seeds. So it needs more tweaking

If you put it this way I follow you completely. The price hasn't been more stable the last month's. Although I would like a price increase because I've bought some coins on a higher price than today's price... Time will tell and I am patient :)

What was the price 2 years ago? What was the lowest price in 6 months? Every time a "crash" happens, the community starts to know the volatility better. It's still a risky investment, but that doesn't make it a "bubble" yet
@_date: 2014-10-04 12:19:25
Just made a paper wallet and stored 1/13,344,325 Bitcoin on it. Printed 3 copies out and stored them all over the house, even one under my AntMiner S3 :p
Now just let it rest for about 15+ years, and see what happens (;
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:27:57
Okay this makes a lot of sense. And for a less volatile Bitcoin we do have to have patience...

They've hold my money for about 8 months. I bought a Monarch in December 2013, upgraded to an Imperial monarch, and then got refunded 8 months after initial order date.
I feel pretty scammed too. They've hold my money so long. If I would have had the money, it could be invested in something that does make money. So I lost 8 months of interests on this...
@_date: 2014-08-13 14:28:03
Sounds logic. But what if all exchanges would do something like this, and become a decentralized institution that they all back it together?
@_date: 2014-10-05 11:06:19
No it isn't, I thought it wasn't really necessary?
@_date: 2014-12-14 11:32:57
I agree, the price of this piece of HW is very appealing for me (:
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:12:24
Short description: The interviewer asks people on the street what they think about corporate banks making money for loans out of nothing. Meaning that when you go to the bank for a loan, the banks "make up" this money, transfer it to the recipient who sells eg a house, and when you have fully paid the loan back, the money disappears again, while the banks earn money from it on interests. So banks make money without actually doing anything, just creating a risky bubble.
What's also interesting is that most people don't even understand what this is all about, and he explains that this is a psychologic fact that people don't even want to be bothered with this, because it's so controversial
@_date: 2014-12-14 11:39:56

Or a Ledger
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:37:34
Oh I misunderstood it a little.
If you want to send money to a specific address, the HW generates a code, which you have to translate to another code using your security card that came with the Ledger. If a hacker would change that address, the code wouldn't confirm the transaction, haven't tried it yet, so could be a little bit wrong
@_date: 2014-11-03 12:11:25
This seems cool. I will do it I think.

The presentation is as good as filled up with information enclosing these subjects a little bit. I may consider to just show this post and let the other students read this after the presentation. Thank you very much!
@_date: 2014-12-30 11:29:21
I was one of the first to get one, just a day after it launched, very happy about it and very easy to set up! You don't need to know anything about multisig or HD wallets to use it, nor about the encryption the wallet uses. The only downpart is that the hardware itself is open spec and not open source, as for the chrome app it is open source.

I was thinking about ordering pizza, but it seems kinda hard
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:46:34
Yeah you have to write down 24 words on a card given with the Ledger. If lost, you can restore the bitcoins with this passphrase 
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:59:01
Ofcourse, they did it with a lot of people, I started the refund process at about 5 months after my order, telling them that according to the law, they can't ignore my refund, even when I'm not in the "6 month window". I got fully refunded at about 7 months and 22 days.
@_date: 2014-05-29 20:20:41
nope it's not old news:
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:41:31
who doesn't? (as an "early adopter") :p
@_date: 2014-09-28 14:05:48

@_date: 2014-09-27 16:29:03
are you using multibit?
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:34:52
There is no specific reason why the price dropped. There are many who claim to have an explanation, but I think it's just a bunch of stuff together that made the price so low...
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:37:02
Just type in your country and a list shows up from where you can buy, lots of choice for me...
@_date: 2014-06-06 14:49:11
Crypto sounds fancier indeed! (:
@_date: 2014-12-09 10:16:11
Not every person makes 1 transaction a day. So I think the majority of people using bitcoin doesn't send bitcoins once a day, I would easily double that amount to 500K or even more...
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:13:28
That is completely true, but so sad. If more people would know what EXACTLY is going on with banks and these kind of people, our society would have a different ending to tomorrow
@_date: 2014-10-08 17:17:09
Thats not what I meant. We've just slain down a bearwhale of 30K, and after a couple days the price has increased with $40~50. I think that is pretty nice to see in a few days. It's not what the price is in 5 minutes, it's what the price will be in a long term. I don't expect it to be a $1000 in 5 minutes, but I would like to see it in months from today...
@_date: 2014-11-03 10:51:18
I have a paper wallet with 1BTC on it. I guess I could show it, although it is not really encrypted so they could steal my private keys, maybe I could make another paper wallet with smth lower than 1 BTC on it.
Thanks for the OpenBazaar Tip, it's in the presentation

I'll be the one
@_date: 2014-11-19 13:32:06
It's not phishing, made a fake account on blockckchain.info and was able to login to the same account on blockchain.info, they bought the domain, it's not phishing but an alias to blockchain.
Unless they actually make the account on blockchain.info, but keep a record of the password you have filled in...
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:42:31
You have some cool tools for that like:

Good guy to ask this. As I'm a web developer a bit (:
Yes the color scheme isn't that appealing...
Lets start with the top bar: it's good but the hovering color of the links isn't a good color I think (the gray).
Don't make your body so wide, have a margin around it. It eyes much better. Also, don't put a title just on the background, always include it in some div. Have more contrast with the background and your body. And don't use blue for everything, try some other colors that go good with it (:
Hope this helps (:
@_date: 2014-12-10 10:16:53

@_date: 2014-08-20 22:31:03
I hope Belgium will follow soon. Belgium has always been late with any internet technology. Hope they don't make the same mistake with Bitcoin in general

Will sony follow now, cause I'm about to buy a PlayStation (:
@_date: 2014-12-09 17:56:14
IMO this is kinda logic. It would be unfair if you gave back the exact amount of bitcoin you paid, as it would be exploited too much. And something else, a refund doesn't happen so often, so if you do want a refund, you should be happy with the same amount in fiat returned to you
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:06:06
I thought I was the only one...
@_date: 2014-09-17 19:56:26
Yeah that's a sad truth...
@_date: 2014-12-16 14:26:08

Yeah that looks pretty cool, and you can't do that to your desktop on Mac...
Although a nice thing I also like on Mac is that you can put tickers and other stuff on your top bar (which is always showing). Where I have a bitcoin price ticker, something that shows how much RAM I have left and with this I am able to clean it when necessary. You can't really do this on taskbar in windows... I think...
@_date: 2014-12-08 12:12:54

He was interested, he was convinced in looking into it, and if this seed grows, it could become a really big seed for the company (although I don't really like the company, but my mom and dad have there cellphone contracts with them). But still, I hope he gets really fascinated by it, and make his flower plant seeds in that company/friends.
I think I'm going to do this more often too! Everyday sounds nice!
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:19:07
Thank you, I think I'm not exaggerating these numbers. Look at Google Fiber today. It's still expensive today, but in less than 5 years it won't be
EDIT: btw, look at how much internet speed and storage have evolved in the last 20 years. It's not multiplying by 2. Also, making it dynamic and not setting another fixed size will be only 1 hard fork, imagine how much the people will be banging their heads against the wall when 20MB won't be enough and have to do another hard fork

Currently I'm maintaining 1TH/s :p
I just started mining Bitcoin 2 weeks with 2 antMiner S3's. As we all know, the chances of me getting ROI are almost nill. My expenses are now about the same as what I earn. But I don't give up, and hodl my coins (for now) until I got to pay the electricity bills of course, and same as you do, I will keep the rest in BTC.
I know I won't get damn rich of this. But hey, it's a hobby, and I like being busy with it!
Ps: I pay about $.24/KWh in Belgium for electricity, we have huge distribution costs here... still looking for an alternative to lower these costs... Thinking about setting the miners at a friends business, who still mines alts with graphics cards cause he doesn't pay for the electricity :p

40% seems a lot... if this happens every year the max block size will eventually be gigabytes...
@_date: 2015-05-30 14:38:51
Then wouldn't it be better to dynamically change the block size just like the diff? I mean, what if 20MB wouldn't be sufficient, even if it's in 20 years from now. And also, in 20 years, everyone's internet speed and storage will have increased a lot, people will have a theoretical download speed of 1Gb/s+ (maybe even way more) and have 5TB Hard drives in their $400 laptops. I think 20MB blocks will just move the problem. Making it dynamic could fix this problem forever

@_date: 2015-05-13 21:39:09
Enlighten me if I'm wrong, but wouldn't we be able to compress the blockchain after a block is closed to reduce the storage it needs? Using a simple compression algorithm that goes together with bigger block sizes?

They apparently helped rich Russians open bank accounts on the islands.
The sad thing is that this news isn't really picked up by the people anymore. They either don't understand what's going on or they don't care.

CoinBase is advertised as the best way to start, yes. There are alternatives but they probably require more skill/KYC/etc.
If you are maybe a bit more tech savvy, try Bisq, it's a decentralized exchange.
If however you're not, I think it is a good choice as long as you transfer your bought assets to a wallet where you control your keys.

@_date: 2015-08-15 10:21:53
For now, I completely agree, and I don't see that changing quite soon. But one of the main "features" of bitcoin described by satoshi is this needs to happen when going mainstream.
Fiat currency can also do this, but feds won't allow it to.
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:14:29

If you move your bitcoin to the cold wallet then yes, they will always stay there until you move them. Exchanges use unique receiving addresses for each customer. Some automatically change after one deposit, some not. It's up to you and how the exchange handles deposits

Why is Cash an attack on bitcoin whatsoever? They implemented Replay protection, and did a clean fork. Nothing attack on Bitcoin.
And Cash shows to Bitcoin that bigger blocks does not mean less decentralisation, and that it can work with bigger blocks
@_date: 2015-08-31 10:29:15
Yep, got the same mail, twice
@_date: 2015-08-15 10:04:26
What if we could dynamically change the block size and using these parameters to get to the size of each new block, block sizes would then be calculated at every X times difficulty has been changed, under circumstances that nodes would be able to cast a vote, and when more than 50%(or more, preferably more) agrees to the new block size, the new block size would be implemented
@_date: 2015-08-31 10:31:24

Don't worry, we all got noob questions sometimes, even if we call ourselves experts. But indeed, a full node doesn't have to mine. And you don't need extra hardware just for the node other than your hard drive and internet connection. On the other hand, a miner does require a full node to connect to, only pools have one, and all the miners connected to the pool are connected to that one single (or multiple in HA env) full node run by the mining pool.

I wish I did the same with my bitcoins back then. I had no other option to sell becuase of my financial situation in 2015(!), and my ego was too big to ask family for a small loan. I could've bought a house with the bitcoins I used to have...
All I didn't sell is for my daughter and it's a small 0.15BTC on a paper wallet, which did gain a lot in USD conversion rates...
 
Anyway, good for you though! Keep on HODLing...

Maybe a very stupid assumption, but would it be possible to collectively batch transactions without even knowing you’re batching them with other people? But opt in like rbf
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:40:12
I'm pretty sure that even as a US customer you can choose the region of your servers, so distributing them over all the warehouses amazon has (and that's a lot) is also decentralising it, which I'm sure those nodes are.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:20:14
As another FY to 2X Core should upgrade to 2.01MB blocks
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:25:44
No, you don’t have to split them. You just send a transaction from the address containing the coins on the main core chain, and another one on the cash chain.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:59:49
If you're talking about a lot of bitcoins the safest way is to go to an exchange (Bitstamp EU, Coinbase/GDAX US,...) and deposit your bitcoins there. Contact them in front of your deposit though. Sell your bitcoins and transfer them to your bank account.
@_date: 2019-02-04 14:58:06
Nice work!
The images load quite slow, which also makes everything jump around. Something to look at?
@_date: 2015-08-15 12:52:08
I don't think that's a major issue. Block size can easily be distributed to all nodes the same way a transaction is broadcasted, when a new block is created by a miner with the new block size in that difficulty shift, every node downloads the new block with the new size parameter set in the metadata of that block. The miner looks at the network to decide what the new blocksize will be according to the votes, and in this way, the network can also predict what the new blocksize will be. And why would you centralize these parameters for the bandwidth. Implement a little script into Core that checks your up- and download speed every once in a while, and then broadcast those numbers to the blockchain, and when the new size will be calculated, you calculate the average of every node
@_date: 2017-11-09 09:30:43
Correct, running a full node helps the security and stability of the network. But you do not get anything in return
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:18:50
Nice one, and quick! (:
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:30:39
And if I were the person to do this I'd also go to other cloud services from Google e.g.
They're probably more reliable than your home network because of the HA mechanisms

They redirected the way they make the series, either you like it or you don't. I get that you don't like it. But I still love it, even though it completely changed

@_date: 2017-11-28 14:54:18
If it's addresses of the exchanges themselves, it doesn't mean that your deposited bitcoin have to stay on those addresses, since you do not own them. It's most likely the exchange moved your coins, but your balance will remain the same on the exchanges
@_date: 2015-07-20 20:45:02
Is it? Signing of the transactions and all the rest is done on the ledger. But you do have to enter the seed when you recover the wallet...
@_date: 2015-08-01 20:46:17
If the store owner also accepts bitcoin, and then they could also use a third party NFC receiver, so if they would open up (finally) the NFC chip for devs, Apple Pay would be completely lost in the process

Had a lot of problems setting up my node on a rpi2 too, but I synced the blockchain on my mac (using symlink to an external hard drive) and then switched it over to the rpi2, it works fine since then, up to 40+ connections and rising
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:57:33
Download Bitcoin [Core]( whatever you think is the best source, install it on a system that has enough space for the blockchain (currently ~150GB) and let it sync
There are tutorials on the github pages where you can find the sources. Also for enabling port forwarding so other nodes can connect to your node over port 8333 (standard)

Reputation system...? There are obviously tons of solutions to this problem. eg make a scale of trustable nodes, looking at uptime, transactions broadcasted, nodes in the network could make a rating of other nodes based on these numbers. And every time a vote needs to be casted, a vote from a more trustable node will weigh in more than from a node that just popped up in the network. If then someone owns 100 nodes, and keeps them up at a trustable rate and contributes to the network, then does it really matter if the 100 nodes would weigh in (in a bad way) this much up against the other 6000 nodes? We're also talking about full nodes, each with the full blockchain on it, it's not easy setting up and maintaining 100 nodes at a time, all on different IP-addresses

Because I've been lurking around again the last two-three weeks again. I didn't see much of open discussion on the topic, so I thought I'd give it a shot.
And on the troll part. I get why you said it, but I'm definitely not trying to do that and avoiding it. I think (again, this is my opinion) that rbtc is just more open to discussion and also does not have any censorship
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:41:22
I agree and know that only a blocksize increase will never be enough, but 1MB is just pathetic, even 2MB is. And 2mb will def not be a cost towards centralisation.
But this still isn't an answer to my question, are there any plans for core to increase at all or not?
@_date: 2017-10-28 09:31:33


Firs time I heard it is insecure, please elaborate. And what backbone are you talking about, afaik there is not a single line of code that is dependent on a backbone?


Why? Even Satoshi said SPV wallets could be used. Running full nodes is exactly something developers shouldn't decide for it's users. As I mentioned before here, if bitcoin will ever be able to go to the masses, would you expect everyone to run a full node, or even 85%? So that the network consists of millions to billions of them? That is totally unnecessary, and inconvenient for users. A good developer should know that you want to keep everything as simple as possible for users. If every person that is just a bit technical  minded and has enough interest in running a full node then that is perfect, if the other 95%(?) of the people in the world don't, that is perfectly okay.
Although it wouldn't hurt to have that many nodes. It's just not necessary.
Also, if you want to compare it to other technologies (which is hard because bitcoin is different, but still), if you want to send an email, are you required to run an smtp server? Or if you want to download files from a p2p network, are you obligated to seed it forever? No, it’s good for the network, but you are not obligated to. Why should this be different with bitcoin?

@_date: 2017-10-06 13:26:07
Then my conclusion is that people like you and me, as users, have absolutely no control over it anymore. And in my vision that I had before the debate is now dead, this being true. I know it has been taken over, and it has been way before the debate, when Chinese miners had over 50% of the hashrate, IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:46:07
Developers are the ones to make it happen, so you should come up with a plan that suits the majority of miners, users, businesses, exchanges,...
What happens when the businesses come up with a plan is 2X, no one wants this and this has brought us so much shit.
It is clear that a lot of people do want an increase, and you should listen to them also. I think that a good plan of action for core would be to communicate very clearly that an increase should happen in the future, you could even already implement it and let it trigger in a further further future like Satoshi once suggested (at block height 
And why are 1MB blocks dangerous? I never understood your stance on this. Bitcoin is “working” just fine with Segwit and 1MB, except of course that fees are outrageously high, and blocks are 100% full. And how many core nodes are there out now? Almost 9000? That’s a very good number. I don’t think a lot of them would bail if you implemented bigger blocks (phased).
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:38:21
I was running a full node a while ago, but I shut it down since I wasn't interested anymore
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:34:00


That is something interesting I think tho, thanks for your input
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:45:44
I agree, trusting only miners in the way they are now is a bad thing. We've already been taken over by China a long time ago. And in Bitcoin as a decentralized system for mining, we already failed.


We're on the same page here already then.
We'll see. I'm curious to what you, and all the other main devs of Core will bring and think of. But a wake-up call and reconsidering your own believes is never a bad thing to do. If we know that today light wallets aren't the best for Bitcoin, I'd reconsider it as much as possible and think of ways to actually make it feasible. It's a should-have.
I'd love to contribute myself, but wouldn't know where to start...
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:52:16
Not really, Core is the one that made bigger blocks into a controversy.
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:42:22
Has nothing to do with what I read or do not read, it is my general assumption and my opinion
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:41:58
I don't really remember, could be a year, could be less.
I think you want to go to the current size of the full blockchain? If that's the case, I don't think it is alarming in how big it is, and would get if increasing to e.g. 2MB
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:08:19
Also remember that not every bitcoin user must run a full node, we don’t have and never will have billions of full nodes.
And I don’t think that the unbanked will run one. Of course decentralization is key within bitcoin. But 2mb won’t break that
@_date: 2017-10-06 19:10:40
As I now see the bigger picture it doesn't really matter. Blocksize increase should just be one of the many scaling solutions
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:35:56
I honestly think if the price goes to 1M, the governments will have to accept it as a means of payment, even for taxes

@_date: 2017-10-28 11:23:55


I don't think it is exploiting it. It's doing it in a way how bitcoin *is* supposed to work. But this doesn't mean it is the right thing/way to do it.
As long as there are enough full nodes to support the use of light wallets I don't see a major security risk. Of course as many full nodes as possible is the best way to go, but light wallets exist, and they will be used. So instead of calling them insecure and doing nothing about it, work with them and make sure they can be used and improve them.


I didn't know about this yet. But as far as I understand, this relies on smaller blocks &lt;= 1MB. This is a very good idea, but it is as 'crippled' as 1MB blocks itself. If one fails, the other fails too. I'm sure there will be other technological innovations based on bigger blocks too. It is just a matter of time and the right bright minds on the project.


I'm still not convinced this is true. And if it is, yes maybe today it is necessary. But we could figure things out to make this unnecessary in the future. I think it is a crucial thing to allow this before going to the big public.


And we must enforce this much more...


Why I said it's hard to compare. But the 'idea' remains the same.
PS: Thanks for taking the time to reply to me (;
@_date: 2017-10-28 08:50:14
My “uneducated” opinion is that while developing other solutions, a simple block size increase which can happen exactly today if we wanted to, shouldn’t be held down just because our “focus” should be on something else...
@_date: 2017-10-27 13:57:25


If you run a node on +5 years old hardware then yeah, I can imagine it is difficult. But come on, it's definitely not impossible, even with 8MB blocks... A hard-drive is not expensive if you want to run a full node

I agree, it sure is not a long term fix. But it is the most easy solution to implement for scaling. If increasing the limit means scaling just a little bit, then why completely block, censor and ban all discussion about it? Every bit helps. If miners want more traffic, let them. 2MB is absolutely not game-changing
@_date: 2017-10-06 17:42:58

For the first part:
This is the kind of comments I was trying to avoid. Stop pointing fingers, it's fucking childish and I'm getting tired of reading this shit.
For the second part:
IMO, LN is also kind of a corporate takeover. Although, I totally agree that scaling bitcoin needs much more than just a block size increase. And I can't think of any "technology" being actively developed that blows my mind in terms of scaling.

I used a VPS service to run it, so neither of those were ever a problem to me, and even if I'd booted it up again it would never be...
Though I do see the problem about the upload bandwidth it uses, but you can limit it however you want. Sure then you wouldn't be helping the network as much as other nodes, but it still helps.
@_date: 2018-07-19 11:15:13

@_date: 2017-10-06 14:18:12
Thank you. This was exactly the comment I was looking for.
I do get it now why increasing is being held off by Core. But I still don't think they shouldn't increase tho.
And yes, on chain scaling will never meet the requirements for running a network like Swift, VISA, and MasterCard all together. And I do think off chain scaling must be a number one priority for the long run.

That's exactly what he's saying.
If you decide to not run Segwit, you can. However your node will process the segwit transactions by default because it was indeed a backwards compatible softfork. Unless you decide to implement something that does actually ignore segwit transactions, but then you'd fork away from the main chain.
