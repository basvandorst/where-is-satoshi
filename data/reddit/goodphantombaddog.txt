It can't but right now this is not really the question. Even if you were to increase the block size to 100MB (in a reality where this would be possible) there is still no good reason for mainstream customers to use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 13:00:44
Until the scaleabilility of bitcoin is solvend (and now lighthouse or side chains are not a thing yet!) those payment dinosaurs are still able to process much more transaction a second than bitcoin.

Except that most people simple dont share your notion of the current system and other libertarian notions hence why they wont care for it to be the killer app.
@_date: 2015-06-26 11:52:54
Why would you ask the biggest hypemaschine for bitcoin, for an objective view on bitcoin? Go to or other subs for a more equal upinion.
@_date: 2015-06-06 11:58:54
If you want bitcoin to integrate in your daily life and not just for niche use, you require it to go mainstream. Its as simple as that.
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:14:54
ya know what i mean
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:57:41
Wuh bu, without those companies, bitcoin would never go anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 08:39:30
The fundamental problem still remains: 
**At the moment** there is still no good reasons for mainstream customers to use bitcoin.
As long as this problem (feature?) remains the price will continue to decline.
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:22:15
Hey you are right. I guess I was misinformed about that.

No, but without bitcoin going mainstream, I won't hardly be able to use it in daily live and then what would be the point of it?
@_date: 2015-06-06 19:36:46
Bitcoin doesnt scare me. Tulpips have remained more stable for a longer time.
@_date: 2015-06-06 14:33:50
That's a nice mantra but doesn't really change the fact that bitcoin will  need the support of the mainstream or otherwise stay a niche product. I know libertarians dream it to be some sort of trojan horse to secretely undermine statist ideologies and policies to the point of destryoing them from the inside - but as always their hopes &amp; dreams will be disappointed, because, as always again, they oversee the most important thing: that people, young, old, rich, poor, mighty and weak, simply don't want to live a libertarian lifestyle.

How exactlyi is this different then insider buying up stocks in anticipation of a certain event, which is insider trading, illegal and not done that much. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 12:35:38
Thats the sound of your theory deflating. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 10:06:49


Well, actually, if I want something funded and you don't want to pay for it, but the tax man requires you too, I think you are the one with the problem.
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:02:52
You can get a centralized version of that for much cheaper and make much more money with it as a company offering exactly the same solution. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 09:57:33
They seem rather keen on developing their own thing instead of using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:39:58


Which is exactly what will happen if you lose. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 11:14:36
Bitcoin can exist without those companies, it wont go mainstream without them.
@_date: 2015-06-06 10:09:08
In reality and so far though, businesses have shown to rather use centralized system over decentralized ones simply because of cost and reliability. There might be a few one who truly care about the centralized trust vs. decentralized one, but most take the adventage of centralized systems over decentralized ones. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 17:46:33
Or maybe they are actually valid points of critisizim.

What has this to do with anything I said?`
@_date: 2015-06-06 12:32:40
I've heard people saying this but given the current development of activity and price of bitcoin this seems not to be true.

Is it? Because at the moment it looks like things are stagnating a bit. Personally I have no doubt that crypto currencies might play a role in the future, but there is no reason not to believe that a FEDcoin would be much more succesfull than Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:02:49

In addition to that half of the places have stopped accepting bitcoin again like the tea shop I went a week ago.
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:07:14
It isn't. There are like a handful of places who accept them, thats about it. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:49:42
Look at the map. I tried spending my bitcoin there but it's basically impossible except for a few bars. I live in Neukölln, very close to Bar 77. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:06:06
There is basically no place in Berlin where you can spend, so I guess he converted them.

Because a) I live in Berlin and b) I just linked the bitcoin "Bitcoin distract" to you in the comment above. The map shows about all the bitcoin shops there are and about half of them have stopped accepting bitcoin.

A maschine can't tell you where to find the best pizza in town, where the hookers are or what are come common scams at the moment. Not to mention that a maschine won't help you when you have a complaint about your room, a drunken guest is keeping your awake etc. pp.

Those are security measurements that comes with the ability to refund fraudulent charges. If you don't want them, get a debit card or a card without fraud protection. It's not "broken", it's a feature. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 18:02:18


No, they are not. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 08:15:28
How can people live on Bitcoin here? There are no hairdressers, no supermarket, no clothing shops, basically no shops but a few bars accepting bitcoin here. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:25:46
Yes thats what I am trying to say wih that. No such place exists. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:15:32
Uhm, yes. It's a fraud prevention feature. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 13:57:25
I like how you keep changing your original argument with each answer just so slightly. Speaks wonder about bitcoin you are still getting upvoted.
@_date: 2015-04-19 13:36:23
I guess that's why people in Germany so regulary order from China that Ebay has an own FAQ page for that. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:54:43
My point was that 2Fa most certainly would not stop all ways of credit card fraud and also does nothing for recharges which is another nice feature of CC bitcoin lacks.
I mean not even saying that bitcoin is without merits, it's just that both system have their trade off. CC come with more security while bitcoin comes with more indepency for the user. As someone who has nevr experienced problems with my CC, those features don't make bitcoin particulary attractive for me. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:31:25
No they are not. Most bitcoin users are from the western world.
@_date: 2015-04-19 12:16:46
Actually I admitted to having lived in Germany and Tansania. Travel wise I ve been all over the world. In doubt you just inform your bank you are travelling there and they will never blcok your card. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:19:42
Well, all I can say is that it never happened to me and that entering a billing adress is not that big of a deal to counter balance dealing without having fraud protection or refund possibilities. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 10:27:09
Well, no doubt it's a trade off, but the problems with CC are highly overstated in this sub. In 99 % of the time you won't run in any problems.
@_date: 2015-04-18 17:14:43
Which would be complete bullshit. There are handful of shops accepting bitcoin in [Kreuzberg]( but thats about it. And about 50 % of shops shown on this map have stopped accepting bitcoin since then. 
@_date: 2015-04-19 04:49:25
If by many you mean a handful then yo|d be right.

No, but Russia is not an important market. The main market for bitcoin is the USA and Europe. If it was made illegal there, it would be dead as a currency. Because what good is a currency if you cant spend it?

Drugs have inherent value i.e. the make ou high. If ou cant spend our bitcoin, the are useless
@_date: 2015-03-20 01:10:56
Sighs. Yes, thank you mister obvious. Drugs have inherent value i.e. the make you high. If bitcoin is made illegal you can't spend it with Dell any more or Microsoft or Dish or your local bar, so effectively bitcoin becomes useless for everything but paying for illegal things, which would not justify the current price by any stretch of the imagination. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 06:25:59

If Bitcoin was illegal, it would basically almost impossible to easily and cheapable convert it to $ and vis a vie. We already have people who have massive problems buying bitcoin and thats with major exchanges running. The adventage of bitcoin in remittance become completely pointless if the people in the recieving countries can't change back bitcoin into fiat. And if the USA would outlaw bitcoin, you can bet most developing countries would too. The few % you save in cost would not be worth the hassle and the illegality. People would not switch to bitcoin, to be exposed to huge volatility that makes fees seem laughable small, they would just drop it.  
@_date: 2015-03-19 22:09:41
They can make bitcoin illegal and drop the entire value of your savings by 99 % within an hour.
