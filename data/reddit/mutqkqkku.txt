I was just describing the "if everyone held" hypothetical someone else brought up, which is yes completely hypothetical and won't happen, but fun to discuss nonetheless since it gets you so riled up about econ101. And there can absolutely be some supply and some demand without a market price, if all of the supply is willing to sell at a price the demand isn't willing to buy at, there isn't a market price until either side budges, or more likely they meet somewhere in between the two prices, and only then there is a market price, when the transactions actually happen.

In the hypothetical situation where *absolutely no one* is willing to exchange their bitcoins for something else, aka "everyone hodls", what's the point of having any? You have the right to move numbers on a ledger, but you don't. Whoop-de-doo. Those numbers do absolutely nothing for you unless someone is willing to give you something in return.  
  
And just because there is no supply doesn't mean the demand ramps up until someone is willing to sell. If absolutely everyone decided not to sell for under $100k it doesn't mean there's demand at that price, it only means that there's a bunch of bitcoiners who can't sell their coins.

Bitcoin is worthless without a market for it. If you can't get someone to give you something in exchange for sending your numbers to a wallet they control, it does nothing. Having the right to move numbers in a ledger does nothing for you if you aren't moving those numbers.

Except you know form the internet infrastructure built by public funds and idk maybe societal order that keeps people from breaking into your apartment and hitting your nuts with a wrench until you give up your bitscones, plus about a million other things.

If you want to make money while taking part in and benefiting from an organized society, you have to give back. Doesn't matter how you earn it, a part of it always goes to maintaining it. You pay to participate, you're free to leave if you don't want to pay.

You need more people to buy in after you or your Bitcoin is worthless.

Yes, have fun fending off the regional warlord's roaming bands of robbers in your stateless Utopia, sure you got murdered but at least the gubbimint didn't take your hard earned money and use it for public good.

Still the only reason you're even in a position to make the money you don't want taxed is government protection and infrastructure. Feel free to shed your citizenship and make your own way in some ungoverned hellzone.

You would've made nothing without the services, infrastructure, legal system and protection the government provides, yet you get really greedy when asked to pay for these services. Just shed your citizenship and move to no-mans land to make your fortune if you feel like participating in society is too much to ask from you and see how rich you get.

The government provides you with the societal peace and private property rights that let you enjoy the increased value without getting robbed and/or murdered, so pay your fair share.

So Bitcoin will go to zero too, since it's fiat money? And since in just ten years thousands of cryptocurrencies have popped up and hundreds have fizzled out, they all too will eventually end up at zero?

Money not backed by a commodity is by definition fiat money. "Having Bitcoin" doesn't actually mean anything but the right to move numbers on a distributed ledger. You can't redeem the energy used to produce those coins, like you'd redeem gold with a gold-backed currency. Even government money lets you have pieces of paper in exchange for your numbers.

The real worth of an asset is the sum of the discounted cash flows it generates over your investment period.

Taxes means paying for the infrastructure, societal peace and economical stability the government provides and you use to produce your income. If that arrangement doesn't sound fair to you, f.ex. you feel it's theft, you're free to leave.

No, it's a loss for the credit card company who already paid the vendor, unless they can claw it back from you.

Why bring up such an uninteresting point?

Taking a "haircut" from customer accounts after a "hack" and refunding them with money minted by the exchange, aka stealing customer funds and repaying them with funny money. Why does that sound familiar...

Well of course labor done a year ago is worth less than labor done today. You having done something a year ago doesn't matter that much if things need to be done today. Of course, if the thing you did is still considered useful and of value today it can retain value or generate income, aka be a good investment of time, effort and/or capital. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 12:20:24
I think it's fair that people have to put their capital to work if they want it to retain its value, instead of just parking their wealth in something that'll always make them wealthier with no effort or risk on their part. Wealth is meaningless if it's not contributing to society or life in any way, otherwise it's just sitting there doing nothing for nobody. Much like you don't have "life-changing money" until you actually change your life with that money.

Yes I'm familiar with the basics of economics. But money now is &gt; money later because you want to be able to put the money to work right away, since it's slowly losing its value and you're missing returns you would be getting if you had invested it in something that's productive and worthwhile to society. Doesn't change the fact that if things need to be done now, having done something in the past isn't getting that thing done right now. People need motivation to work so society can function.

No, the credit card company pays for your purchase and tries to get the money back from you, and if you can't pay back the credit card company is out money. I know very basic economic concepts are hard to grasp for you since you're into Bitcoin, but c'mon.
