I just dump my 400 bitcoins. waiting for 4k
@_date: 2018-06-01 12:05:31
100k end of the year
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:05:07
Too much hype in december last year. People right now not buying cause they know it can fall in just 1 day 
Since january we got 0 progress
The bad thing is that we dont break 10k last time. After too much dump people just give up, and no one want risk their money.
If bitcoin drop to 5k i think its a beginning of the end.
mt gox destroy cryptomarket and that is true.When was the key moment to break 10k he just drop his stolen bitcoins...
So i think 6k is a last chance to pump price. If we go down it will be over.From 5k to 4 then to 2 and lower.
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:50:55
new race to 10k

new ath incoming
@_date: 2018-06-04 10:14:06
Well, i think people have quite enough 6 months dumps. Bitcoin has not progress since january.The best time to invest was in 2016-17, right now too much people know about bitcoin, and they expect they gonna be rich, but its not working like that, it would be so easy. 
Whales don't want rise btc price cause in just 1 day can be dump.
If we can break 10k last month, it would be look better, but right now.. most of holders  just doubt about btc.
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:50:21
