Relies on chain.com for blockchain data. All requests are proxied through api.ledgerwallet.com. There was talk of moving to SPV mode, in which case it *shouldn't* need Ledger's servers, but I'm not sure if that has happened yet.

Bitcoin's creation rate was meant to mirror the rate of gold mining.

Careful. Potentially phishing.

No.... Nooooooo. No no no.  
For people out there that may not know:  
At the time, BitTorrent was held as a triumph for decentralization and personal liberty among CypherPunks. Satoshi Nakamoto birthed the Bitcoin project in the CypherPunk mailing list, developed it alongside CypherPunks, and likely was a CypherPunk. This was the reason for the mention in his email.

Just a piece of plastic/metal/whatever that's usually marketed as a 'souvenir coin'. Nothing to do with Bitcoin other than the design.

Lightning works on top of Bitcoin just fine, no need for a different coin. Likely that LBTC is trying to capitalise on naming confusion.

There is another project calling themselves 'Lightning Bitcoin' as well with the same ticker

I use Bitpay cards, mostly because I can link it to a Bitpay wallet I control.

For buying, Coinbase and Gemini have pretty good mobile apps. If you don't want to sign up to an exchange, you can try Local Bitcoins (though I think they removed cash transactions recently)

For small amounts, a decently trustworthy mobile app will do fine. For large amounts it's hardware wallet hands down (or glacier protocol of you're technically savvy).
A few good mobile wallets to try might be BRD, Samurai, or Coinomi.

Depends I guess, what amount do you want to swap from free to invest in security to protect. A Trezor One is about $78 USD, so maybe $780 to make it 10%?

Nothing is unhackable, but as far as I know, Glacier is the closest to being so with Bitcoin priv keys if you do things right.

Double standard, with government currencies the individual is attacked, whereas with cryptocurrencies the system is the target, and it's attacked through the individual.

Example: Buy nukes with USD, the nuke buyers are bad, buy nukes with Bitcoin, Bitcoin is bad.

Yep. If they do batch sales, it gets deducted from your wallet instantly anyway.

Usually they are linked to a custodial Bitcoin wallet, when you make a purchase they sell a portion of the coins in the custodial wallet.
