I should have said "did not meet the expectations" - whenever that happens, prices drop as the expectation was priced in.

So am I! I will track it on CHAIA - Lets see if the upswing will be steady. :) The media usually picks up steam a few days before the price makes a response.

Haha of course. I think there is a misunderstanding �� I mean the metric of active addresses.

Awesome! I should have kept an eye on the data dictionary. Thanks anyways. I look forward to having a considered standard for certain metrics in the market sometime in future.

Im sorry if I offended you. I just wanted to share two posts showing the relevance of media in the cryptocurrency space.

I consider a standard as something everybody/most people use as a metric. That has nothing to do with decentralization

Hi 
thanks for the info. I was just wondering since [bitinfocharts.com]( and [coinmetrics.io]( have different values for "active addresses" and they also show inclines and declines in the chart.
people usually say that "lots of active addresses" indicate a bullish sentiment (obviously), but according to your explanation, the number of active addresses would then never decline (due to permanent nature).

Thats awesome to hear. Its good that the system is optimized in such way - astonishing! And yeah, after such technological advancement I am sure that there will be a day where technology itself will do the job of securing assets.
