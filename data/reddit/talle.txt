_Just_ got a ticket response: "we are aware of it; we're fixing it".

Having the same issue on and off for months now. Support didn't do anything other than "we'll look into it".
I know bitstamp is celebrated around here but I really detest their API and their support. (I have to constantly watch their page for "we're canceling your API keys" news; really? Can't afford email messages?)

np; I'm already verified and trading. :)

I'm already verified in mtgox, vault-of-satoshi, crypto-trade and maybe some others.
I *was* a happy bitstamp customer too but from where I see it they screwed up with this:
* very low profile notification of upcoming BIG change
* no bitcoin withdrawals for unverified users (why the hell?)
* sloppy verification procedure with disproportionate strict rules
Relevant [bitcointalk complains]( from others.
BTW, I did **not** decide to close my account. I was trying to work out a solution when they throwed this in my face.

Very cool. I really like the detail of the activity log (notifications).
I would reaaally like to see the trading interface while I wait for the verification.
*edit*  hey! nice API. [Added](
*edit2*  I get **"API call failed: Missing required parameter: currency"** but documentation says 'currency' parameter is optional.

After a few hours, withdraw successfully completed! Yiei! :)

1. What if I don't want to close the account? (In anticipation of new documents for example) 
I don't understand their need to lock my funds and I don't agree with the view that "that's OK".
2. That seems to be a new policy (as you can see in the [bitcointalk thread above](
3. I got a pm here from bitstamp staff and seems we can work things out. Maybe it's just a miscomunication issue.
4. It's not a matter of inconvenience, it's a matter of trust, which has taken a hit by the points in my previous reply.

No, email confirmation not required. Just run the script and wait.
Since this script is supposed to run localy (even from command line) I would say it's secure.
I wouldn't worry much about API key, it's the API secret that matters more. You could change the script to request the API secret (like a password) so you wouldn't have to store it.

FYI, after purchasing 8 bundles with bitcoin, I can't get a 9th; I get "Purchase Canceled" message:

They are still "Waiting to be processed" though... :-/

Yeah, not that you could be wrong or something.
