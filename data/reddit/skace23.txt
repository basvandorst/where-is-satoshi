Most people dont see this. Go on coinmarketcap,com see every altcoin graph and see price in btcoins. You will see continual drop to 0 and then pump. Therefore it depends on market cap. You can pump it to 2x-100x price. After that same drop. Its like bch pump few weeks back, but with all altcoins. Bitcoin will birst in no time to ath.

First they will panic sell to save their mortages and loans in case of losing jobs. THen it will skyrocket thanks to inflation and crysis.

Iam with you. Tax maybe cashing out. Nobody knows that tradinfg is liable to taxes for each transaction in USA. Goverment supplies 0 services so their cut is 0. If they operate gate to fiat world, its ok to tax crypto to fiat (maybe)...  Another example could be Satoshi. If he buys something with bitcoins directly, for 500M dollars - he will have to pay 200M in taxes? WTF??? He only works in sushi point with minimal wage... Ok put me in prison and feed me for free till my death :)

Bitcoin brings efficiency as Uber for taxi, airbnb for renting and google for searching. We are blocked or influenced beacuse of banks and taxes. You are taxed by 50% of theoretical gains your employer wants to give you. In addition it brings lots of paperwork for accountants.... This is changing now. We give everythign better efficiency by removing banks and stupid regulations. In state sectors people will lose jobs. Only production will remain...

Great answer, thanks. I have recently watched andreas video about how you dont really need confirmation for this kind of payments. If it is returning customer or it isnt a big deal to lose one payment, thats good news. My only problem is if different wallets dont stop rebroadcasting transactions if the fee is to low to clear out. So you dont get the bitcoins this day, but maybe in month or year... Or most wallets dont rebroadcast?
If Iam buying a car or house, it is necessary to wait for confirmation, but ordinary low amount payments dont need confirmation if the tx are rebroadcasted indefinetly.

I know why did your brother did it. Point is... Mass adoption of btc will lead to mass starving and hyperinlation. World econony will colapse. Price will surely go to miliony of dollars but thanks to hyperinflation. Workers will abandon factories and you will not buy tesla, mansions... You will buy what is left in posteconomicapocalypseworld... Only solution how to win in this is instant switch to stoneage era. Buy a flight ticket and go to africa tribal or jungle and life without money. Who is smart will realize this. Only three possibilities. 1) life in posapocaliptic world in developed countries and slowly die in hyperinflation which is already going on in eu and usa. 2) live like 10000years ago on lonely place on earth and wait when someone with better technology will kill you. 3)

Fees not that much with SEPA. I sent almost same amount. You will be able to send it in 1 SEPA transaction (max 50000€). Maybe you will lose 0,25% (coinbase cut) and like 20-30€ for transfer max. Thats nothing compared to gains... From coinbase send it to GDAX and LIMIT BUY. Dont leave it on GDAX. Use hardware wallet or paper wallet afterwards. Transaction fee on bitcoins are &lt;1€...

If you ask how much... every month loan payment is same i was sending to my saving account. I will pay this loan in 8 years in fiat money. But I have already more in bitcoins than i will totally pay in fiat money on this loan. I can pay it off right now. But that would be 1000x more stupid than this way.

Do new transaction go first or last vs older transactions? With the same fee
@_date: 2017-11-06 11:56:24
Bitcoin is lifeguard vest on titanic. Now the price is low. Will you value your future freedom over having 2 vests? :)
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:06:18
Yesterday ordered second one... and payed for it...
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:29:49
I had these nightmares 2 weeks since starting thinking about bitcoin deeply. I mentally colapsed for 4 days. Then recovered. We all gonna die, but we will see world burn. Canibalism, murders, postapocalyptic world full of angrry people, total anarchy. Few "citadels" with killing drones which kills everyone who is close enought to the walls... And it will be built faster than you think. Maybe 5-10 years from now.
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:58:10
Stupid idea. Standard is 1m, 1s, 1kg... If they have psychological barrier, i bet that they cant even realize what is bitcoin and what is blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:18:24
give it 2-5 days. Then blast to 11-12k
@_date: 2017-11-05 11:31:33
How is that different from loan for housing? Bank is enslaving me.
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:16:12
We will see what is better :) remindme! 3 years
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:08:54
Good, more reasons to stay and spend in crypto economy.
@_date: 2017-11-20 10:56:29
Few weeks back he told all that bitcoin will bring slavery to mankind. This week he sells his lambo for more Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:16:13
Iam just working to buy moar
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:22:09
Go for BCH if you dont know what you are actually doing :D
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:10:14
I have bought few monts back. Now my only issue is how to get the money out without taxation in future. Maybe I should wait more and ignore every law out there. Just Exchange BTC for house. (in 5-10 years horizon)
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:09:18
This ^^^^
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:15:57
If you live in deflation world, you would care only for housing, food and basic clothing = ecology promblems solved. No more stupid teslas and high energy demanding bullshit
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:59:21
We are living in wild west. There is nothing more proffitable adn secure than hold your own money safely
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:00:43
You fool. There is only bitcoin or "Bank product". You have chosen to trust bank again.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:25:42
Yeah buy CME's product which they invest in bitcoin so you will not make as much as you could if you invest in BTC and you will feed some bankers too... Nice  idea. Or you can go to bank and get 0,1% interest in 1 year. Thats even better :D
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:39:56
Roger Ver will do something cool and steal your bitcoins and leave you with BCH:D
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:49:58
They would use it to buy it directly ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:56:58
They dont trust bitcoin and they dont want to jump in. They will lose in long term.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:01:17
I did it. I can repay the loan just now but i better spend my fiat on loan over years. First week you will be afraid with the price but once BTC has value over your total loan you will be much calmer :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 11:11:51
Few weeks back he told that bitcoin will bring slavery  now he miraculously recieves "free" lambo ;)
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:57:44
If you want to make a lot of BTC, sell items for 10$ or 9$ worth of bitcoin = faster adoption
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:53:14
Credit card = instant.... Sepa (EU) = 24-48 hours
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:25:15
Ok i get it. So why not be transparent and say "account"... Currently its  where no bitcoins really are... You know how this realization can scare people? Little info or tooltip can be here to not scare to death...
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:35:55
Until bankster came in 70s

You can hit me with bitcoin lighting 
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:22:26
Yes, I can do it too. When I buy, index says Buy, when i Sell, index says sell... Easy. Pump and dump
@_date: 2018-03-10 11:35:34
You are doing it for nonprofit? Then it is a scam. Legal or not
@_date: 2018-03-14 03:34:08
Just dont have debt. Debt is for slaves
@_date: 2018-03-31 21:13:45
Buy it using money.... i mean debt
@_date: 2018-03-16 11:56:44
Can you feel the fear in Rotshield's eyes?  newspapersandnews
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:28:25
Future (5-10 years) Prepare for world without electricity, shops... Just buy land, build a shelter, keep armed, and plant your own vegetables and some animals. Also have bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:41:45
Ok dont be independend on money. Unlearn everything just buy things and services. You become slave.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:02:54
If your perception of value is higher than current price, throw money at it as pokeball. Vote with your money.
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:51:58
Can you imageine price of BTC if you cant buy it with cash and only mine it with equipment you cant even buy? :D If they ban it, price will always rise
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:19:27
Just set your price in btc directly. Stop using fiat
@_date: 2018-03-05 10:36:22
Yeah skip developing world tools directly to most advanced technology
@_date: 2018-03-10 10:36:14
Just use some imagestock photos, photoshop some certificate or medal of trustworthy and make longtext how its safe. So much stupid people will fall for this scam. OR just copy every betting site or roulette for CS:GO skins.
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:28:48
Its free ads for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 10:54:43
Pls sell, I want to see how 1$=1BTC looks like
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:54:32
There is no future of crypto. Buy fiat and let bankster do their job. Milking cows and shaving sheeps.
@_date: 2018-03-21 12:18:04
the text pls.
@_date: 2018-02-26 18:04:36
You want bitcoin for free? If Yes, than its money/asset/thing. You want debt to someone for free? Then its not money.
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:44:56
You know why its going down so slowly? Because every time, someone tries to guess the bottom, so it will take 6 months of decline to find real bottom. Just stop buying bitcoin and we will find bottom faster.
@_date: 2018-03-28 11:59:16
Wow - this bombshell. Lets make cryptocalendar ! 
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:52:56
He told hes waiting for the dip
@_date: 2018-03-13 14:48:17
That number of assassinations !
@_date: 2018-03-10 14:07:29
If so, make inflationary illegal :D
@_date: 2018-02-13 06:11:34
Real value of bitcoin is 0... many banksters said
@_date: 2018-03-01 06:12:06
I'd rather carry my bitcoins on paperwallet in the rain in flood situation.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:53:04
I like how it goes down. You know why? look at GDAX and unzoom tradewalls. I remember when on Septemer, there was only 3k btc buy orders now its almost 15k. We need to burn these wannabe traders. PUSH IT EVEN LOWER PLS!
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:46:44
Betting without real money isnt fun, thrill or addicting

"You hurt me or anybody I love, you get nothing. Do it, kill me and get nothing, I have nothing to lose" 
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:58:01
They provide stability to bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-03-12 13:34:35
Its like shooting anything to sun, its keep burning hotter and faster :D
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:21:20
So you wanna use bitcoin to give the fee to Square and stinky fiat to merchant... NO WAY. Only direct payments. Otherwise you will end up with all btc in hands of BIG BANKSTERS AGAIN! Bitcoin is for personal use and transaction only.... People never learn. Go dig some gold and store them in ....ehm.... bank and use some shitty paper issued and start to believe in good banks again.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:45:24
Just create website just to sell your house and put it in media that some crazy idiot sell his house for btc. Works every time
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:11:09
Sure its will be fractional. They will borrow fiat from national banks to buy bitcoin to payout you.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:50:45
Witness me! (Sprays chrome on his teeth)
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:43:02
Split your BTC to BCH and give them to the beach
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:22:45
Load of bread

Switch to better currency through greed ��

@_date: 2018-03-11 20:51:43
Banksters say that value is zero. Panic sell now.
@_date: 2018-03-17 08:20:50
Rothshield and banksters
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:42:26
Just insist that it is foreign currency. No taxes. You dont report sold Euros at exchange after Europe trip
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:01:54
I like the idea that whatever happens, crypto is always the winner :D
@_date: 2018-03-31 20:54:20
Economy is not science. Its repeating learned "truths". There is no reasoning. Just believe like in church
@_date: 2017-10-26 08:13:12
Hodl. Not Listening. HODL!
@_date: 2018-02-03 16:18:59
They need to sell Roger Vers mined shitcoins until it has no price at all..  He is already selling his used mining hardware as new :D
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:02:35
Get ready for tidal wave :D Just regular morning, look at graph
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:54:00
So set your price in fractions. 0.001btc per hour and 2$ on top of it
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:56:05
Do you spot incoming economic war between USA and group of China/Russia/EU?
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:05:08
Wait until 2020, inflation in world will be greater than mining inflation of bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:09:58
No block halvening yet, so it will stay in 5 digits area. It isnt bitcoin price rising, its fiat falling
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:42:13
I think the same. "Price" should grow more natural way, not like in this hype. At this rate of grow, its likely to see 30-50% drop next week.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:29:28
So its just matter of adoption. If 1/10 of all people on planet use btc we can establish it as standard... 
@_date: 2018-03-10 08:07:04
Call it " scamitty mcscam iq&lt;80" 
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:56:49
Can anyone make statistics of percentage of mined bitcoin which is UTXO and second one, which will show how long after mining it was spent?
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:43:03
I spend it later in my life. Need some stable money over time. Maybe house, car, whatever needed in my life over time.
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:22:50
Bought 0.1, 0.1, 0.45 and 3 ... pure emotions
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:35:58
Stop this Inception thing pls DiCaprio
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:49:05
People expecting to go 50% down will be amazed when banks will invest when price drops just 5%
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:14:39
Bitcoin will serve as a backup currency. Normal people will use for everyday purchases another currency with lower transaction fees. You dont pay with gold every day, you pay with different credit...
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:09:49
Price is just speed of  transfer wealth to bitcoin. Every 10 minutes there is shift of 125000$. Is it slow? I dont think so.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:22:37
There is something like amount of trust. I dont trust too much if I spend only 1$ on BTC. I trust BTC 18000x more than this person who dont buy bubble gum and "invest this much"
@_date: 2018-03-06 12:56:22
If you tax using crypto, also tax using cash. Price of paper changes every day. It's not worth much more than plain paper.
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:15:38
Stop buying. Let it fall on the bottom
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:11:49
Its like cash. Wallets are production numbers on cash. It take enormous resources to track 1 banknote and in result you get 0 information
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:28:52
@_date: 2017-10-31 07:15:54
Thats why I took loan last month.
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:14:36
Look at dow jones, nasdaq, whatever and unzoom to 5 years or to max. It looks like bitcoin at 30. Dec. 2017. Everything is going downward. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:18:14
Bitcoin is corelated with fiat apocalypse. Every abd news, market colapse... bitcoin rises
@_date: 2018-04-03 09:26:44
I will repeat it. Buying bitcoin is one way ticket. Yes you can make dolar profit, but the goal is to everyone have it and then all of suddent they will realize that they can pay to anyone and they will not need convert to fiat. Therefore price doesnt matter. Adoption only matters. More and more people will buy it to get rich, but they will not in short term. Extra long position.
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:11:10
I didnt lost any of my BTC
@_date: 2018-04-04 12:44:33
Look at every big corp - 1 bad news = -9% of share price. Look facebook, tesla, uber...
@_date: 2018-04-04 10:52:03
Mining and ilegal trading.
@_date: 2018-04-04 08:03:59
Just take it to court, make them lose time and prove who is wrong. Both sides thinks that they are right.
