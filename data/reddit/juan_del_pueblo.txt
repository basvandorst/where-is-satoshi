Jesus. I don't even I can imagine that amount of money, let alone being a good enough man to donate so much. Keep on being you!

Hmm I did not think to try that. Thank you.

I did not think of that, I will discuss this with my parents within the next few days.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:34:13
My parents are fine with me using my money in a manner I deem fit, however in doing so I agreed I would ask for no financial aid for such in the matter, nor do I believe they would be willing to do so. They believe I know what I am doing, but they both agree that it must be on my own.

Holy shit OP, keep us updated.

Question here, why do you prefer Gemini over Coinbase? I haven't bought yet and I am curious as to why I should choose one seller over the other. Also do they have LTC?
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:34:41
Yes, but I did not see any willing to sell to buyers without previous transactions.

I think he may be a little shady, check his profile.

Why are there two identical pages though, with different domains? I contacted support for the BTC store and they said they could not verify the validity of the other site.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:43:54
I do, but I doubt any are willing to make purchases with the amount of currency I have in mind. Also would you want to wait a month in the way prices are now and projects like the Lightning Network on the horizon?

What exactly are faucets?

I have a car but between school, extracurricular activities, and work, I don't have quite the time to drive that far. As far as Meetup.com the closest person seems to be 63.3 miles away from me.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:58:14
That is where I found the closest seller being 40 miles away. And with the schedule I am leading currently I don't have the time to for that much distance.
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:32:19
I have a wallet, but where would I find such a seller? I've tried local things such as Mycelium, but no luck. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:31:19
Nearest ATM is 60 miles away from me :(
@_date: 2017-08-17 02:37:38
Seems like many of the bank options require previous trades.
@_date: 2017-08-19 00:28:59
What wallet were you using?
@_date: 2017-08-17 23:03:25
Is that site some sort of Phishing scam since it seems to be a clone of the actual Bitcoin Store website? Or is it entirely legit?

You would probably like the Red Rising series by Pierce Brown.

I actually have a different username and password for this reason. And my more important passwords I like to keep in the 20+ range.

From what I've heard all things decentral was part of the bitcoin store but split apart.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:09:03
PSA if you just recently turned 18 GDAX won't let you sign up because it can't find you in public records yet. And support will just tell you to "give it time". Well back to Kraken since they can manually confirm your identity instead of waiting.

Oh damn man, I'm sorry to hear that. Is doxxing pretty common since a decent amount of redditor seem to do this?
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:07:26
I find I'm pretty comfortable with my account security as I invested in a good VPN, I'd look into one just to feel safer in the case of future attacks. Plus Reddit is the only social media I have.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:00:08
I'm just curious as to why people delete their accounts every couple of months, since I have heard this a couple of times now.
@_date: 2017-10-20 01:31:32
Too bad GDAX says I don't exist in the public system and support says they cant manually verify me.
