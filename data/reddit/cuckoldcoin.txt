What he means is central bankers are going to create their own blockchain systems to transfer capital, not adopting bitcoin or any other shitcoin like this board thinks.

Defacing U.S currency is a federal crime. I'm reporting you.

This is what happens with centrally planned economics and corrupt communist party members living like kings and sucking all the wealth out of the country.

Hyperinflation is usually caused by a host of political issues.

WTF is wrong with you people lol? You're making a thread about how if I didn't buy X I could have made Y amount in bitcoin appreciation. It's no wonder why there's so much mental illness and suicides in this community when you look at what could have been in hindsight.

How do you know that guy is the robber? because the car might be the same color? If I was him id sue for slander and libel.

Why didn't OP post those pics in the article then?
@_date: 2018-05-31 21:15:04
Time stamps can be edited/altered and there is no definitive way of knowing that the masked robbers are in fact that guy. It probably is the same guy but any decent lawyer will get him off scott free.

These are Federal requirements for deposits and withdraws over a certain limit. Trust me no bank actually gives a shit about what you spend your money on. Look at all the drug money they get caught laundering lol.

Teslas are low quality cars mate I don't know what to tell you. Both the chevy volt and bolt sell more than the tesla model s. This is nothing more than a meme company.

So bitcoin cash is stronger, is more intelligent and can do more of a workload than bitcoin?
thanks just bought 100k.
@_date: 2018-10-15 19:35:41
Lets see telsa hasn't earned a profit yet, is in massive debt, has quality control issues and can't live up to the output numbers they speculate they can make. I don't know why you simpletons like this company so much. They aren't doing anything that any other car manufacture is doing.

LOL if the dollar collapses you better be ready for a societal collapse and buying guns, ammo, food and some precious metals. Your bitcoin on your cell phone isn't going to help you.

Actually it was the federal reserve detracting a third of the money supply from circulation via deflation that caused the great depression after the crash of 29.

They have every right to not extend credit to purchase highly speculative investments. Every bank does this. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:54:33
Your wisdom and advice are going to fall on deaf ears with this crowd of gamblers and speculators hoping to make a quick buck. It's the only thing that keeps them coming back to this community. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 03:03:10
Doens't mean it's the best at doing so.

It's an unregulated security that you voluntarily put money into because you thought you were going to make an exuberant amount of money on a pump and dump. People who bought into this got everything they deserved. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:16:19
Nobody is putting their money in this shit anymore. Corps are developing there own blockchain systems, certain alts provide a faster and cheaper was to transfer money and as far as store of value gold, realestate and bonds offer a traditionally safer and stable way. The only purpose crypto has is to transfer money for illegal vices and the price of the coins are irrelevant with coins like monero.

Why does this community always move the goal post when it comes to cypto? Everyone is here to make a quick buck but when the price plummets you say your here for the tech or that you don't care about it's value...

uhhhhh I can call my credit card company and cancel the transaction or get back fraudulent transactions from merchants. They also extend to me credit which can be payed back at a later time. None of which bitcoin can do...

Yes put your whole life savings into it. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:54:01
This is also why it sucks and is lagging behind alts in features that merchants and consumers want.
