At the moment the best way to store your bitcoin ..100% secure  is cold storage..however you don’t want it..you can mentally encrypt the code of your BTC..with dates/months etc. very important in your personal life..however the risk is you experience memory loss/dementia with in that period..
May be you can have multiple layers of security to decode the code..

One day..and vey soon..the equation would reverse &amp; people will be cursing banks  wondering when did they let all this happens to themselves

You got a very strong point..I guess that’s the least we all could do at our end for BTC/crypto mass adoption..
