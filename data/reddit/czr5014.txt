From my understanding, LN is like building credit card companies on top of bitcoin. Since the blocks won't be raised, we will be forced into payment providers centralized services. Damn shame we can't have bigger blocks and LN. Competition is healthy, but if you keep blocksize low, fewer people can innovative using the network because some business models won't work with small blocks.

the bitcoin price will rise. If we as a community can maintain the same demand over the next few years. Then we should on average see about a 25% return on our coins a year because the supply gets cut in half every 4 years. Once this occurs the "smart money" will clearly see it is worth investing at some point during incremental rise then bubble. I didn't even calculate into the equation fact that new asic's are being created causing increased scarcity.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:51:51
Yes currently the bitcoin network has been filling up blocks with transactions due to an artificial limit of 1 mb. Almost everyone wants to raise it, most right now because the blocks are currently filling up. Bitcoin core wants to wait a year or longer to raise it

Well I don't need the architecture to be identical to bitcoin, i just like that idea of the decentralization consensus with a decentralized data structure. I Think games in general would be 'more accurate', 'more fair' in this sense as well as have some beneficial effects. Using halo as an example, Every game there is a host and if they leave the game, the game pausing and selects a new host, and if the host has a bad connection, its reflected in the entire game as well. Using a similar architecture as bitcoin, it would be neat if everyone had a continuous input and the network would come up with a decentrailized concesus in a regular, very fast(near VoIP speeds thats like 1/50 sec, sounds like 1/100 is to fast)  consensus. If a player has a bad connection, it wont effect the other players, if some one leaves, the game will continue as normal, and the actaul game inputs would be 'more fair'/'more realistic' as everyone is constantly giving input of where every player is. Overall, I feel like it would be a little more robust, fair, and accurate

OK, i had an idea of that came to mind when i was thinking about the bitcoin protocol the other day. I though of another use for the block chain technology. Each game console would be "mining" when they start to play a first person shooter online. Each game console would try to solve a block, which would be 1/100 a second long. Who ever solves the math problem gets to submit there block as the next 1/100 of a second of the game. Each game console would  calculate what all of the input of each of the controllers where for all of the gamers with in the game. The blocks would then be relaid to all of the gamers console and that would be next 1/100 of a second of the game. The blocks could also get relaid to an phone app or a website, and anyone would be able to view the game, look through the history etc. etc. I think this would provide a more equal online gaming experience, as well as to open to the door to new ideas and the ability to play a game decentrilized and wont have to stop and wait for the game console to constantly "connect to a new host". If someone leaves the game, it wouldn't effect the other players. There are no coins, the reward is if your game console solves the problem the get to submit the next 1/100 of a second of all of the controller input of all of the gamers on the game. All of the gamers would receive the blockchain and it would consist of all of the input from the controllers from all of the gamers, each block coming from different game consoles on the network playing the game. This is just a rough idea, let me know what you think.

Ok so at the end of the day, there is a limited amount of people who can send transactions through every block. So in the future, it might not make economical sense to shop online with bitcoin and may only be used by banks and institutions to transfer large sums of money. So LN is kind of a micro-Blockchain on top of bitcoin that will enable us to shop online? Will there be a limited space in LN and the same scenario with blocksizes occur again? Will I have to have another wallet to send LN transactions and new payment processor handle this new chain? I just want to know how I can continue to shop online lol

High fees are the goal of segwit, and most of the transactions on the lightning network. He is showing what it's like with no onchain scaling. If segwit activated the Bitcoin protcol has no incentive to increase block size past '2mb'. This is what using Bitcoin will be like. You will HAVE to use lightning because either the fee is too high or the network takes forever, you choose. If your a fan of segwit, get use to it, until lightning arrives. I have never used lightning so I  ant say how closesly it will resemble Bitcoin it might be the complete opposite

This is the main reason, censorship got so bad that it split into multiple subs/forums, causing consensus to be orders of magnitude more difficult to achieve. I think this sub treats roger poorly for all that he has done for the community.

I can understand why they would not compromise for segwit.

Banks will just be LN nodes in the future, This makes perfect sense. It will not be practical for the average person to use the bitcoin blockchain, as it will be much to expensive to use day to day. Segwit scaling basically lands us right back to where we are today, everyone using banks for daily transactions, With the difference being bitcoin as the world reserve currency(but it will be the world reserve currency regardless). If we have larger blocks, the average person will have more of a chance of using the bitcoin blockchain (the poor), which may be important depending on individual circumstances. The properties of bitcoin that everyone loves, may or may not be carried over to the Lightning network. On the LN network, transcation may flow very differently then on the bitcoin blockchain. LN operators can determine which transactions can go through and which transactions will not. LN operators will have a lot of power over their nodes. I worry many do not see this as an outcome. If you think being banned from a subreddit is bad, imagine being banned from LN nodes.

There is only a limited amount of 0's and 1's that can fit in 1mb, there will be a limit to how much information can be stored, no matter how efficiently and intelligently you format the data.

In the short term this may be true, however, I think over a longer timeframe the demand will increase. My personal demand will remain constant(bitwage) short term and as one can pay more bills and buy more things with bitcoin, I will increase the amount of my bitwage towards the longer term.

These guys are going to look so stupid when there coins turn out to be shit coins

Because of the long term difference in inflation policy, there will always be pressure/incentive to sell ether for btc

If the UASF is the minority chain, and the majority spends an 'anyone can spend' then...

LN hubs will have the same tendency to centralize as miners do today
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:32:10
All this is true, however, if you are poor, like a majority of the population, you'll only be able to open one payment channel. Are you going to choose an LN hub with few connections or one with nearly all connections

It's more then a dollar and it's not even 3k yet.. at that math it would be a fee of $330+ a transaction

UASF Will be an altcoin first
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:07:40
Segwit won't fix this issue! Omg these people are brainwashed. Bitcoin will still be slow with high fees. It will allow "lighting network" you know another altcoin priced in Bitcoin, you can use that after segwit and the fees go to blockstream. It won't work though because the market hates them and we have more viable solutions like any other alt to trade with
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:32:24
I really like the idea of small blocks (2mb to 8mb) is there node software so I can support this? It's surprising how rational they are.

Subway accepts bitcoins in allentown, pa
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:09:59
If you think segwit is a nice solution, you do realize it is used to set up lightning: another altcoin priced in Bitcoin you can trade with. So you won't actually be using Bitcoin, you understand this correct?
@_date: 2017-07-04 16:10:30
Don't worry the central banks will be back as LN nodes
