It,s just an example.
  states that gold is the most usefull element/thing/mineral on planet Earth. That is just looking a set of unique physical properties disregarding any economic/market value.
 So ye, it can be used it dentistry.
I heard some time ago they are trying to use gold in finding cure for cancer. When it is physical commodity with set of unique properties no other element has, who knows for what can be used in the future, in addition to what we use it now.
With BTC, the only thing you can do with it, is to give it to somebody else:)
While looking at "unique" properties of BTC it  has none. A lot of other crpyto's have same better properties. So they are not unique.
BTC is just abount branding/marketing. That is outside of the scope of looking intrinsic value of a bitcoin.

Ye, bitcoin is digital gold and is as better as digital house is from real house.
Digital house is so much better. You don't have to worry ever roof leeking. Or you can place it on the beach, or near the mountains.
Digital house so much better. You can't do that with real house.
You have lot more costs with real house. Real house is really a waste. You have practicaly none with digital house!
You can renovate digital house much cheaper and faster. You can renovate whatever you like. Digital house is much better.
Only 1 thing. There is no utility in digital house. You can imagine you live there, but you can't actually live there.
Same with bitcoin. You can imagine it has value as others do, but you can't do anything with it. You can make a lot of stuff with gold.
 says 
"Of all the minerals mined from the Earth, none is more useful than gold. Its usefulness is derived from a diversity of special properties."
And thats independent of any investor/market opinion. Thats from perspective of geologist/engineer/ppl that make things. And valueing digital house higher than real house is same thing as valuing bitcoin higher than anyting pshyical.

Sure, 
you should also put quotes in "commodity" :)
It's easy money. Get rich. 
All I'm sayin is greedy pigs will get slaugthered

I didn't say it is "imaginary commodity". It's not commodity. 
Thats twice now you said something that I said, that I didn't.
Classic internet:)

store of value in quotes, because it's not real store of value:)
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:23:04
Haha, the new gold. What good is bitcoin at making spaceship. What good is bitcoin at making tooth, etc.
Comparing nothing to something and saying nothing has more value than something is the new paradigm:)
@_date: 2017-08-14 09:50:22
I said comparing commodity with something imaginary and saying imaginary is improved commodity is just insane.
All the basic human needs are satisfied from some kind commodity and bitcoin cannot replace commodities ever.
It's very easy to see bitcoin will have 0 value eventually.
There are 2 options
1) we use bitcoin untill the sun explodes and kills Earth. 
2) we replace it with something else in between. Maybe there won't be humans anymore in hundreds of million of years. 
Whats more likely. And also, I know piece of wood will have value in 100 millions of years. Because even when all the time passes. You can do something with it.
So piece of wood is kind a more valueable than all the bitcoins actually. 
Just momentarily people are deluded:)
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:11:53
In 10 years bubble will pop and btc will be worth little above zero I guess. There are other crypto's which can take its place, or the whole crypto market collapses. That would be the case when money stops coming in and mining costs excede the price. BTC needs to rise indefinetly, since costs rise exponentially.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:38:14
This is my favourite,  gold 2.0, haha:)
You can't compare something imaginary with commodity. 
Bitcoin is nothing like gold or wood or iron. You can make usefull stuff with commodities. With bitcoin you can make like nothing.
You have to know that bitcoin is highly speculative asset and all its value derives from people believing it has value. It has no store of value because it has no intrinsic value. It is store of a hype and belief.
So plan is to get rich and get out at the right time! There will be slaugther...
@_date: 2017-08-10 22:57:26
Why has bitcoin store of wealth? 
It can't have it because again, no instrinsic value:)
Its medium of exchange, payment system, etc.. but no value.
A thing with 0 intrinsic value cannot store wealth.
@_date: 2018-06-18 15:58:24
thats excatly how much all bitcoins are going to be worth eventually. There is logic in this..
@_date: 2018-06-27 04:03:30
You have cart before the horse.
lets say nuclear waste is pretty rare compared to all gargbage. That doesn't make it valuable. There for sure is some durable garbage out there, some stainless steel whatever.. That doesn't make it valuabale.
What makes things valuable is what you can use it for. 
The logic is flawed. Its like saying 
1. when it rains, the streets are wet.
2. if I water the street, it will rain.
Its implication, basic logic princip... 
So the usefullness of bitcoin is basicly , you can give/send it to somebod else. But you can do that with a horseshit also...Now off course not as efficient as bitcoin, but its just example to show the flawed logic in asserting value to things.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:45:09
You should look definition of a intrinsic value.
Commodity has intrinsic value. 
Piece of wood was usefull 10k years ago and it is usefull today and it will be usefull in 10k years. I can make toothpicks with it.
Because it has intrinsic value. 
On the other hand, if aliens came and gave you 1000 cryptoalien currency. What can you do with it? Nothing, because it has no intrinsic value.
On the other hand, if they gave you some alien commodity, glowing maybe. It would be priceless. You could put it on a car and drive around city and be the only one with this commodity. Or do something usefull with it. You probably wouldn't sell it, it would be priceless. And the base reason for being priceless is that it has intrinsic value.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:28:23
They wont be using bitcoins...
@_date: 2018-06-26 19:40:54
All you can do with it, is to give it somebody else.
But thats not real trait. You can give garbage to anyone, that doesn't make garbage usefull.
When you realize this, and realize that what any1 can solely do with their bitcoins is basicly nothing. And that means that its intrinsic value is zero. And you cannot store wealth in something that is on its own useless.
So stop spreading FUD, people will lose and did lose a lot of money because of this FUD. Poor them... 
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:03:24
Lol :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 15:42:12
If you own BTC you don't own accounting system.
But, its nice to hear this fantasy stories :) I get enjoyment out of it.
@_date: 2019-06-24 10:50:29
It has no inherent value. Inherent value is different than market value - which is price. Inherent value is, lets say the price is zero, what do you do with it?
Lets say you have piece of wood, piece of gold, (future) contract, a share of the company. So if the market price of this things are zero (nobody wants them) what can you do with them? 
Obviusly with wood and gold there is a lot of things you can do. 
If you have a contract, well even if the price is zero, you still have what says in the contract, whatever it is. If you own a share, you own a % of a company.. 
So what do you have when you have bitcoin and market price is zero? You have nothing, nada, dzero, nič, nula, niente...Its virtual, it represents nothing.
And I can think of only 1 more thing, that is the same, and that is fiat money. The € , $, etc... I mean only the numbers in bank account are the same. If you have paper money, you can still do something with them (put on a wall, burn them, etc).
That means inherent value. Absent of any market price or market opinion, what can you do with it? What value does it have to you?
The only thing you can do with bitcoin is to "send" it to somebody else.  But , a lot of things have same trait..
@_date: 2019-06-24 01:47:07
This is kind a funny:)
The nonsense stories just keep coming out and its enjoyable reading. Thanks for it.
So bitcoin cannot store value because it has none. Only things with intrinsic value can store value. If it has no value, it has no value to store. If it goes to zero (its a possibility), what value does it have and what does then zero counterparty risk and other stuff help you. It can't.
Counterparty risk is hidden in a different way. You expect that in the future, someone will take your bitcoin and give you something you need. You expect future to be in this way and not any other way. What if there is no person that would give you something for your bitcoin (because its price is zero for example)...
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:55:07
I mean its common sense, you are just caught up in the bubble.
I gamble too, make money on fools buying it now but I could also lose if bubble pops so.. 
When it does, you will remember this post for a long time...
Anyway common sense reffering to my post number 1.
I'm just having fun time debating people caught in the bubble. Hearing really funny arguments from time to time:)
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:15:37
dude:) stop fooling yourself.
Think about it closely. If some people are getting rich, where is the money coming from? From the people who think they will also get rich:)
Lets say bitcoin reaches a plateu someday (big assumption).
In order to realize profits, people need to sell. And if price stop going up, there will be no buyers and only sellers and this process reverses.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:02:04
Bitcoin mentioned 0 times in article?
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:37:28
What you said is 100% true.
However, decentralized systems are very inefficient and resource consuming.. 
So if all transactions in the world would be via btc (which is currently impossible), the costs would skyrocket and we would need like 100TB adding on to chain every day. And if its decentralized, we need like 100TB *number of users extra space EVERY DAY...
So to apply what you said on BTC is fantasy. And opposite is true, it destroys wealth by being inefficient.
@_date: 2019-12-20 14:27:07
Virtual/digital Bitcoin will be real money as soon as you can distinguish your real thirst by virtual/digital water.
Remember when somebody said that he plays poker. Then another one asked, for real money or virtual?"Just for virtual..." Which means kind a fake money..
Thats all Bitcoin is, virtual fake money. And virtual is by definition somewhat opposite to real. Which means Bitcoin doesn't have real value, just virtual.  Can only store virtual value, again not real. Virtual value can be anything, from lamborgini, to a star made of diamonds, or dust of dirt.. Imagination is the limit to virtual value.
On the other hand real value has limits in the universe it exists.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:36:01
I found out that costs of decentralized system go up more than linear to number of users. When I first heard of bitcoin, the transactions were practicaly free. Now that more people use it, they went up.  Because of
1) dificulty went up
2) halving - you get twice as less coins every 4 years.
That means costs are going up exponentialy and price has to go up too in order for system to stay "stable.
If everybody would use it, the costs would be unbelivable high. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:48:21
How is wealth created?:) Or unlocked? What does it even mean, for wealth to be unlocked?:) This is good one, never heard of this one yet.
IMO Its being destroyed, just people dont know it yet.
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:06:59
but fiat needs to be enforced by (illegal) power of the goverment in order for people to use it as money.. market will reject it otherwise sooner or later..
The only way bitcoin becomes money if goverments enforce it ,right..
So what about bitcoin vs goverments thingy...

Sliding slope of hope. Bear market.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:25:36
In bull market you buy. In bear market you sell.
Its easy. And when the bear market stops is ussualy somewhere below fundamental/intrinsic value. Since crypto's have 0 intrinsic value, there will bear market stop and maybe new bull will rise. Maybe.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:12:25

@_date: 2018-02-13 11:50:50
Now seriously, it's actually a good point.
Remember, 19th century USA had a mild deflation, and it was the biggest boom/ growth in history. 
Deflation is not a problem, it is a good thing. You don't have to risk anything to appreciate your wealth.
Middle class was made because of deflation.
Lets take a look more closely. If the production of a nation increases 2fold, that means that there is twice as more stuff. And if money supply stays stable, that means that prices drop 50%. Which means that everybody can buy twice as more stuff with same amount of money.
Its not magic, its just the consequence of the 2fold production.
So if deflation was 1%, people still demanded 5% interest rate (some avg cca). And yes, it was a lot, but it was affordable due to vibrant economy.
So the refer to your original point. Its actually not a problem. If lending was so lucurative, more people would be willing to lend, which would push down the interest rates. And market would find the balance. Yes still, it would be more expensive than now, but today's state is totaly fucked up. Printing trillions of dollars, rates artificialy low. It favors debtors, since debt is losing in value. The biggest debtors are goverments and they try to inflate the way out. Its the usual way.
The state is unsustainable. The debt will never be payed off, it will reset.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:20:01
Dude, I'm afraid its time to sell.
It was time to buy when it was going up. When its going down its time to sell
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:34:57

I understand him.
Firstly if bitcoin  be the "money", then why buy an ETF that prevents you from spending your money instantly.
secondly why buy an ETF then you can buy bitcoin directly.
When buying ETF you are sponsoring whole a bunch of people behind it. 
Usualy ETFs are mixed bags of many assets/stocks/etc. So the advantage is you buy 1 thing, you buy hundred things simultaniosly.
At bitcoin ETF, its the same thing. You are sponsoring people for nothing

bitcoin has nothing in common with gold except opinions about it.
Gold is: Physical element, consists of atoms electrons in specific formation, specific set of phsyical properties.
Can be used in a lot of ways, since phsyicaly it is the most usefull element/thing on planet earth.
Forget about market value and opinions. This is it.
What is bitcoin, its nothing phsyical. Its a belief system. 
So comparing gold to bitcoin is like comparing undewater flora with feeling of desperation.
