I was initially attracted to TradeHill (when it first opened) because it was developed in Python/Django
Just because I have experience with that framework and know that it generally makes it difficult for you to shoot yourself in the foot WRT security (as opposed to PHP where it's often quite easy).
Sure you can screw up in any language; but certain development frameworks are built to make it damn difficult to screw up in such a way.
PHP is a special case because it's so prolific; there is just a huge amount of PHP code and developers (of all skill levels) out there; and more often than not; a given chunk of PHP code will be crappy just due to sheer scale of it's dominance. (In much the same way that your average windows box is probably going to be a security nightmare; just because there are so many more of them with different skill levels of operator)
The only thing that would have worried me more than PHP was if they had decided to write the site in C or another unnecessarily low level language (at the scale they were at then, at some big enough scale this would actually make sense).
Knowing a (small to medium) exchange is coded in Python, Ruby, Node.js, Java, or even .NET with a well designed framework would make me feel a lot better than PHP.
But even if they had coded the exchange in Python; some of the approaches MagicalTux mentions would have still been worrying.
One of the basic tenets of secure development is not to write your own solution when you don't have to.
It sounds like MtGox built their own web framework in PHP (including SQL bindings).
To me; that would have been a worrying sign in any language (Unless they were truly at a scale where such hardcore development becomes necessary just to scale at all)

Try to think of NoSQL db's as a lower level database framework.
You don't generally get transactions (the biggest negative against MongoDB in this context) with a NoSQL database.  But it is perfectly possible to implement transactions, joins etc... on top of such a database.
You just give up a lot of the performance and possibly other advantages typically associated with NoSQL.  But; it can give you more control over when those tradeoffs are necessary.
Still; I'll admit hearing that Coinbase runs on MongoDB isn't the most assuring thing in the world; without also hearing about exactly how they implement transactions on top of it.

Yeah there are a few exceptions that would prove to be likely incontrovertible alibi that someone isn't satoshi, but they would be few and far between.
Essentially you have to prove someone had no access to computers for 3 years.

I've been experimenting with this and brain wallets at  and I plan to port some of that to a more general bitcoin wallet/utility as a client side js web app.

Information Superhighway died out for the same reason skeuomorphism is in interfaces.
It's clunky, inaccurate/imprecise  and doesn't stand the test of time.  
A ledger may have been recorded on paper, but it's already way more of a concept by now.
WWL is short and doesn't seem to have anything more significant than station callsigns associated with it.
World Wide Ledger pretty accurately describes the most basic and core use case of bitcoin.

Ever heard of intranets?  They often have www sites on them even.
As a branding I think WWL is perfect, but I disagree that it is inherently against alt-coins, only for a primacy of bitcoin as a significant store of value.
Other chains and coins can and should interact with BTC, things simply will not scale to the level this subreddit wants for true disruption of the financial system without addressing scaling concerns and a division of coins with different purposes and networks could be one way to address that.

That's a transitional step.  Once WWL gets out enough as a term it will be the most common use of the word ledger and then it will make way more sense and sound much less pretentious to just say 'the ledger'
@_date: 2015-05-17 02:45:35


Because everyone knows what it is.  Superhighway doesn't exactly get used much in normal conversation either.
WWW was still somewhat of a skeuomorphic thing with the invocation of a 'web' but it's much more precise; precise enough that web is the most important term.
Similarly Ledger and Chain will likely win out for brevity and simplicity.  The internet hosts the WWW btw, they are distinct concepts; and similarly the Blockchain hosts the Ledger but a ledger is not the *only* thing you can do with it, just the most prominent, common and natural seeming thing for us humans.

All these petitions are good for is asking questions; so I'm giving it a shot.
On April 1st 2015 Mr. Obama signed an executive order titled
"Blocking the Property of Certain Persons Engaging in Significant Malicious Cyber-Enabled Activities"
Many in the CryptoCurrency community believe that this order may prevent citizens from donating to Edward Snowden, Wikileaks other rights activists, whistleblowers and concerned citizens.
In the Citizens United court case, it was determined that money constitutes a form of speech. This may be practically disastrous to our democracy; but it is a objective fact and this is proven by CryptoCurrency.
Will I or others will be prosecuted for choosing to support a fellow American who they feel is being wrongly prosecuted?
Specifically Edward Snowden.

This is a proposal I had for such a state sponsored CryptoCurrency as a solution for to redistribute wealth from Bankers and other Cronies back to the people without centralizing value/power in government first
From: 
Going on that note, what if the government printed the X trillion dollars and gave it to all citizens equally?
If you could prove somehow that this process did not specifically enrich political donors, politicians, business interests etc.... 
Then you will have implemented a indirect flat tax against the entire world's USD holdings (wealth)
But you have made it progressive-ish? by giving it back in the form of a UBI.
The key here is proving fairness.  If you can show that the Monetary Inflation does not go to cronies; most all of my objection would go away.
Where does this take us?
Consider the government administered crypto currency with a UBI in Finland.
What if the USG used cryptocurrency as a way to provably inflate the USD in an egalitarian way?
If the USG set up a system where X trillion BitUSD were printed every Y period, then distributed ALL of those funds in a provably egalitarian way you would eliminate the centralization of power/cronyism arguments against traditional QE style strategies (trickle down).
You might even call this trickle up.  
Cryptocurrency seems like a great fit here, because a Blockchain at its core is a distributed public ledger; and that seems like the perfect sort  of thing to keep government honest in a program like this.
This could be a way to bootstrap a modern, state backed digital currency that also functioned as a progressive wealth tax without centralizing power and distributing it to cronies in the process.
This is still a fresh thought, and may sound like rambling; am I making any sense at all here?
It seems like a very interesting approach, and a governmental policy even **I** might support.
It eliminates most of my moral arguments, and then we just have to talk economics.
But if you ask me, I'd just as soon watch the State crumble and die as it justly deserves.

I'll echo what others have said here and say that input sanitation is not enough, you need to parameterized queries.  Sanitizing in addition to that won't hurt.


While I understand this mindset, it erodes confidence in your security.  If you believe knowing the general platform your system is built on is enough information to give potential attackers a meaningful advantage it indicates a lack of security confidence on your part.
TradeHill isn't exactly open about it, but it's pretty clear they are built on django and this is at least somewhat reassuring (if for no other reason than an indication of CSRF protection and query parameterization out of the box).
Do you have plans to offer bounties for responsibly reported security vulnerabilities? 
Security Bounties are another way to boost confidence in the security of your exchange (if the publicly listed bounties are not claimed) and bring out "white-hat" penetration testers.

Back up the wallet *HEAVILY* You probably want to print a base64'd version of your wallet file to for dead tree backup just in case, not sure how to go about doing such on windows.  Keep in mind that your local wallet file never changes when you receive BTC, you don't need to be connected to the network to receive BTC
Never connect the separate computer to the net.  When you need to withdraw, copy the wallet off your disconnected 'bank' computer.  
Create a new wallet on the disconnected box, and connect your wealthy wallet to a internet machine, send all the bitcoin you want to keep secured to your new bank address.

That is wrong, the amount of electricity scales primarily with the difficulty.
Difficulty is a function of how fast blocks get solved.
You could conceivably have a single bitcoin (new chain) node running all the worlds transactions that way, with no difficulty built up because of no competition between miners.
The competition between miners for new coins, and later fees are what drive difficulty, and the electricity cost of mining.
Bandwidth/Storage costs could rise in the scenario you describe though.

I think bitcoin blazed the trail for solving the generic problem of distributed authority necessary to make digital currencies viable, and most of the competition will be with regard to economics.
One of the big complains about bitcoin is that it is deflationary by design, intended to function much like a precious metal.
I think very soon we'll start to see some competing bitcoin like currencies bootstrapped with different economic models.
Bitcoin seems backed by a very Austrian mindset, and I expect we'll see at least one substantial competitor show up with more of a inflationary / Keynesian model.
Namecoin is kinda this, but not really because the coins per block are fixed they will eventually be deflationary as well, just slower (unless the domain name demand really takes off).
And namecoin is an example of the other big feature I think we'll see with upcoming currencies: some type of backing/function other than controlled scarcity.

No, and even if it is, it's not that big of a deal.  Copy/Back up your wallet.dat file somewhere (not sure where it will be for you, depends on OS) and you could uninstall/reinstall the client, then replace the wallet file.  It takes a while to download the blockchain, and if you don't leave the client running, it can take it some time to catch up.
It just takes some time, it's not as instant as it could be.  I think you can speed things up by attaching processing fees to the transaction though.

Bitcoin is pure speech.  When I send bitcoin to you I'm just telling the world I think you are worth it and the world agrees if I am worth at least as much to them.
But it is still just some concept in speech.  You don't have to have ever even connected to the internet or used a computer to receive bitcoin value.

My understanding is that having such a large amount of the network power is not enough to forcefully create a false transaction out of thin air (you'd have to brute force the key).  Excessive power would only enable double spending (i.e. they'd have to have the coin to begin with to do nefarious deeds, and such would involve getting goods for double spent coins, not the theft of coins themself)
Am I incorrect in this assessment?  How have they used the hashing power to steal the $500k?

Once you assume an attacker has admin access on your machine, your screwed.

The other guy is wrong, receiving bitcoin does not modify wallet.dat
The main thing to remember is that bitcoin is a distributed transaction register, and wallet.dat is a collection of private/public crypto key pairs the public keys are used as addresses.  
The keypairs in wallet.dat are used to identify you to the network, but there really is no concept of storing coins, only identities.
When someone send you bitcoin, they are just telling everyone on the network: "I want this public key to have X bitcoin".  The machine that has the wallet doesn't even have to connect to the internet to 'receive' the coins.  Once the network validates the transaction was valid, the identity assosciated with a specific keypair in your wallet is agreed to have bitcoin by the whole network.  To claim the bitcoin you just have to prove you are the owner of the public key (with the private key).
Sending money will modify the wallet and potentially create a new keypair (address) that excess funds will go back to.  That is to say, if you have a wallet with 10 bitcoins, and spend 1, the other 9 bitcoins are likely to go to a newly created keypair in your wallet.  So if you don't backup your wallet after sending bitcoins it's possible to lose bitcoins (by losing the newly generated pairs with coin).
To help you think this concept out a little more, you can have a computer thats never connected to the net generate a bitcoin address.  Store that wallet to a SD card other backup, and continue to send bitcoin to it indefinitely.
No need to ever load that wallet file, until you want to withdrawl/spend the coin assosciated with it.

Yeah, I agree with what your saying, even if it is difficult to ban or regulate outright, it wont stop governments from trying.
I guess the point Camp BX, and myself are trying to make is that it will be very difficult to craft a law in the U.S. that does the following:
 * Outlaws bitcoin, namecoin and other cryptocurrencies
 * Does not outlaw arcade tokens, facebook credits, microsoft points etc...
 * Stays within the confines of the 1st amendment.

Even though there is no pretext that the bank account balances are anything other than accounting entries in a computer system; The balances are still backed by an agreement to be redeemable for a physical good (cash).
Traditional currency account balances amount to a contractual obligation to the account bearer, this is in no way true of  bitcoin associated with an address.
It is only a conceptual idea, not a contractual obligation/liability or instrument of ownership for anything.
@_date: 2011-07-11 04:02:27
Harder than that, it's just a concept/idea/speech.
When I 'send bitcoin' I'm really just broadcasting to everyone that I think you should have it, and proving that I am who I say I am.
It is then the collective decision of the network what happens from there.
Speech is the only thing transferred when you "send" bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-06-28 00:12:57
Strangely enough, the closest regulatory analog for bitcoin is speech.
I can't send you a bitcoin, because a bitcoin doesn't exist.  All I can do is tell the world I think you deserve 'it', and prove I'm me.
All that happens when I send a bitcoin is speech with agreed meaning and value.  
I'd hate to be the one to write a law to outlaw Bitcoin in a free society.  Not just because doing so would be wrong.  But because it will be quite a difficult thing to define.
Bitcoin, in concept at least, if not specific implementation, is likely to be the most revolutionary piece of technology since the internet.

This is a bad idea, and not just for the reasons already listed.
If bitcoin is treated more as a proxy for the USD than as a item of it's own, it becomes much easier to attack in the same style of Liberty Dollars.
A large portion of the reason they were convicted under counterfeiting rules is that the coins were denominated in USD and contained some similar language.

Charity is only one option.  If you build a system that can redistribute charitable donations you can fund that same system through other means.

I wouldn't call it an error but I agree the "not enough bitcoin" thing was a little cringeworthy; though it was part of a broader point trying to relate the incomprehensible scale of aggression that our existing monetary policy allows by means of comparison.

Valid point, the difference he was trying to make I think is that much of the US (especially after pearl harbor) believed WW2 to be necessary.  Quite different from later adventurism.  
Hitler was quite a bit more serious about potentially screwing us over than Saddam ever was.  Stefan is indirectly trying to claim WW2 is a (more just) war than those that followed.
Bitcoin would end WW2 from the perspective of the germans, Hitler would have to be much more up front with the people about his fiscal needs and plans if he was unable to fund via fiat.
Also, US went off the gold standard (but not completely) before the 70s, the Nixon Shock was just the final nail in the coffin.

This is a very long term strategy, not an overnight thing and I fully concede that it's quite difficult.
But let me lay out my little slice of a utopian future here.
If we can assign [provably unique identities]( to everyone (think homeless people)
We can entitle them to bitcoin.
We can form [non-profits]( that accept tax-deductible donations in any currency in any nation, and then contribute cryptocurrency to the UBI, and buy back cryptocurrency from the entitled homeless (giving them cash which is more presently helpful to them, and bitcoins to those who help them).
Does that sound exciting at all?
It can become a distributed bitcoin currency exchange that encourages charitable giving and spreads bitcoin into more hands.
@_date: 2015-03-21 20:17:22
It doesn't make it impossible to tax, it just makes much clearer the nature of taxation.
We have fiat currency because even traditional taxation is too onerous to raise to a level sufficient to fund the excessive governments of today.
At a minimum, a successful cryptocurrency removes the power of the state to tax via inflation.
Beyond that, by existing parallel to the state; it forces the state to actually get more aggressive and threatening in order to secure tribute.
They can't convince friendly banks to hand over your money; they have to convince YOU to hand over your money just like anyone else.
Bitcoin just exposes that the only differentiator government has to offer is the threat and application of violence.

If/when it will happen is another thing.

FairShare will always be stateless as a matter of its' technical nature.  It can know no real borders in concept.  Non profits that want to utilize it just have to convince their local government that contributing to FairShare is in the public good to a degree that allows tax write-offs.  These organizations would not have to coordinate at all; they could be openly hostile or even competitive to each other and still only be able to improve This is a very core part of the concept.  Nobody ever takes anything from anyone in the FairShare system, it's always pure giving.
[Giving is its own reward](


FairShare doesn't need to make any determination about what needs to happen for society for progress.

The thought is that if we can build a fair way to distribute it, the bitcoin will come.
I think you could make the case to miners that an effective Bitcoin UBI spreading the currency further and wider than ever before could do great things for the value of their remaining holdings.
I think people living in freer countries than myself could build automated, provably fair, blockchain gambling casinos that treated the UBI pool as the house (always give, never take)
If we build a solid enough stateless solution, we might even be able to convince states to contribute as a form of foreign-domestic aid.
We can build non-profits in each nation to accept tax-deductible donations in BTC and Fiat, then give BTC to the UBI, and buy bitcoin back from the entitled homeless (to put back into the UBI).
Where the money comes from is just one component, and we can build the rest without having to even think about it that much.
All we need is a way to manage the funds pool, and get funds into it at all; and then we can allow the free market of ideas to creatively fill it.
Payout would be unconditional.  FairShare is a way to give, not a way to take.
