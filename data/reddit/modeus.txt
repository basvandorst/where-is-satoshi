I'll be honest, I expected more.

Why are you changing the focus from "asshole" to "not perfect"? Everyone is not perfect, but not everyone are assholes.
Do you realise there is a difference?

How can we peacefully coexist with those who seek to control bitcoin? The goal here is not to sing kumbaya.

Don't trust people.

That's not really true though I think. A lot of modern companies with living founders can tank their share price. If Gates dumped his holdings overnight you'd see some action. That's why he's been selling bit by bit for years. There are many more examples. 
In terms of buying, it seems to me that it's very easy to buy Bitcoin. That's my experience, and I live in the 3rd world.

Same as if you held a huge amount of shares in whatever and sold it all. If you saturate a market, demand dips. This isn't a Bitcoin thing.

Well, the comment I was replying to was saying Bitcoin had a liquidity problem, in the context of someone selling a significant fraction of its total distribution. My point is that if you hold a significant fraction of anything, and you dump it, the market will feel it. I wouldn't describe that as a Bitcoin liquidity problem. In my view, that's a function of oversupply - which anything can be affected by. 
I'm not taking the broad position that Bitcoin is the same as the USD, but that would be an interesting discussion.

"This BIP will be active between midnight August 1st 2017 (epoch time 1501545600) and midnight November 15th 2017"

Alright, has a flag day been selected?
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:27:12
Explain how.
@_date: 2017-04-07 08:31:31
No, I mean explain how to exercise it, as a user.

I've run out of care. This bullshit is coming to an end, even if it means the end of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:52:28
Understood. Agreed. It is unproven, and also likely. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:32:14
So he didn't create it? I don't know, but ok. I'll believe you. However, if he's using it, doesn't that seem... dishonest to you? 
You're right that others can use it. They would also be dishonest if they did. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:46:45
Yes.
