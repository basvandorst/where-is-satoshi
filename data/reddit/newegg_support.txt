Hi animalrobot,
To answer your question, Newegg.ca does accept Bitcoin for a majority of orders. However, there are some types of orders where Bitcoin won't be an option: 
If the product you're purchasing is something that should be supported on our website, then please email us at wecare so we can help you figure out why you can't make a payment with Bitcoin.

Please contact us at wecare and reference this post and we will look at what happened in your case to provide additional training to our agents so we may avoid this problem for you in the future. Thank you for your understanding and we look forward to hearing from you. ~ William

Hello Kallebo1337,
After checking your order using the chat ID, I see that the order is not being processed due to a payment decline. This could be a security measure with the bank, which is why we recommend contacting your bank for more information. When a payment is authorized by the bank, the retailer receives an authorization code (sometimes you can see this code when you get a physical receipt from a store) and we don't have that code. If you need further assistance in the meantime, please send us an email at wecare and we'll gladly double check this for you!

Hey thothrising,
Hmmm a very good point indeed. We do offer a support page about this very subject:
 
However I like the idea of an automatic message that will display if you choose Bitcoin during the checkout stage. We are always looking for ways to improve our site, and we appreciate all suggestions and feedback. I feel that this is a great suggestion that can be implemented. I’ll be sure to bring this thread to our Web Team for review. If you have any other questions, or if you need assistance, feel free to email us at wecare

Hey there Cruciatus8,
We're still accepting Bitcoin as a payment option on the website. The only types of orders that are ineligible would be like mentioned by another poster, third party/Marketplace orders. It's possible the TV you were looking to purchase was coming from one of them.
If you'd like we can double check for you, just send us a PM with a link to the tv.
