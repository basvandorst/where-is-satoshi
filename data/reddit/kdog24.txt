Depends on the external volume.  To over-simplify, you could say the first $500k would fill at $100, the next $500k would fill at $110, the next at $120 and so on.  It wouldn't take long before the price is 50% higher and you still have a lot of money to convert.
Exchanging back into USD would have a similar affect.  Theoretically, you could break even, but if you are the one supplying most of the volume then you would most likely suffer significantly losses.

What does helping out a Nigerian Prince from political persecution have to do with Money Laundering?  
I guess I'm a "glass half full" kind of guy.

I'm pretty sure the Prince wouldn't like to be referred to in such a crass manner.

I understood some of these words... looks fun though.

To be fair, the bank teller was just trying to keep his job.  Most people in the banking/financial industry are trained to scrutinize any transactions that might be related to money laundering.  Most any overseas wire transfer is going to raise some questions. It has really gotten bad ever since the Patriot Act and, for the most part, is total BS.
I agree with you and other posters that electronic currency IS the future and we are (over)due for a paradigm shift.  I just hope we can keep our privacy along with it.

If I were a Nigerian prince with millions of dollars to move, I'm not sure Bitcoin has the volume to handle this.  Converting millions of dollars into bitcoins, then (assuming days later) converting it back into dollars would send the BTC market on its tits.
This could easily cost the Nigerian prince 20-30% in lost value depending on just how shit-giggled the market gets.  It would be so much easier if you could just give him your personal information.
You'd be doing him a solid.

Not enough people to sell you the BTC you need at the beginning.  Not enough people to buy your BTC at the end.
In fact, the best way to convert such a large amount without losing value would be to slowly buy bitcoins over many days.  Then unwind the position over many more days.  Of course, BTC exchange rates can be quite volatile on any given day regardless of a Nigerian Prince's actions.
Thus, the reason Bitcoin isn't mature enough (yet) for moving millions of dollars.

Off topic, but I was using the Satoshi Dice 97% several times a week with large bets.  I looked at it as a way to "earn interest" on my BTC balance.  It was working great until I lost a huge chunk of my balance in one roll.
I haven't played dice since.  Now I throw my BTC away on sport betting.
It is cool that your are being so benevolent with your remaining BTC. Cheers!

I also was preparing to purchase a TV today.  The description says free shipping, but going through the checkout process they warn that large items that cannot be shipped via USPS may be subject to a large item freight delivery fee ($100).
I backed out of placing my order until I can verify this fee is real.  I have contacted Bitcoinstore, but still waiting for a response.
Anyone else have to pay this $100 freight on LED TV purchases?

Thanks, this all works and is very helpful!...but I was wondering why the "Normal" fee policy would have tripled from .0005 to .0015 without any warning?  Does it change often?
