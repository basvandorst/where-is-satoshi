Smart contracts could be used to enforce the loans and auto debt your wallet. What currency is used is not as important as the tools to transact. The biggest improvement to a house transaction would be blockchain tools for title transfer and movement of funds from one person to the other.
Edit: to elaborate, we don’t purchase homes right now with gold bars, we invented dollars as a means to convey value. Bitcoin is just the gold that will back other monetary tools based in blockchain.

I wasn’t trying to infer it would be as simple as that, I’m just trying to provide some context to how solutions could be designed to answer the OP questions. Anyone that wants to point holes in my comments is free to post their idea of how this would work! And yes most all blockchain coding is done by humans, hence the growth in blockchain dev jobs.

This question and any associated answer will not ‘put the power of the bitcoin mining network in perspective for people’. It’s like saying how fast a Olympic bodybuilder can run the 100yard versus an Olympic sprinter. Just because the bodybuilder is super powerful doesn’t mean they are designed to sprint. Judging the bodybuilder this way actually skews our judgment on how powerful they are at their specific specialization. The answer is probably zero hash because no one is going to waste supercomputer resources to see how many hashes it can accomplish when it is clearly designed for other processing functions.

Most exchanges have daily limits. Depending on where you got millions of dollars in bitcoin would be a big part of exchanging it. Most large miners have companies setup with bank accounts in favorable countries. You can depreciate equipment cost and other accounting methods to reduce your reported earnings and tax liability. Nothing wrong with earning a large amount of bitcoin and converting to dollars If you do proper accounting and reporting. Now if you have acquired the coin through illegal activity then yes you are going to have a tough time converting to fiat in large amounts through exchanges with KYC and AML.  Does this help your curiosity?

Depends on the bank, I’ve heard nightmare stories about Barclays. Also depends on your banking history with that account at said bank. I thought you were just asking out of curiosity,  but if this is really something you need to do, you should setup several investment accounts, think fidelity, Td Ameritrade, etc rather than a commercial bank account. That way you can spread it out to limit issues with one account and these firms are good with you bringing in large amounts of cash. If it’s legit then these firms would love to help you bring the fiat out of the exchanges. Good luck

Yes inevitably as the cost of mining increases (less reward for hash rate, capital cost of higher efficiency machines and lack of increase in the price of btc) will force the mining industry to consolidate like any other industry that will only survive by minimizing cost. The only thing countering this would be an increase in BTC price. So hopefully we see a steady increase in the price to continue to incentivize smaller mining operations to operate independently of the mega mining companies/groups.

Correct that’s not the intention. Right now no one can make me pay my mortgage. But if I don’t there are legal contracts that dictate the outcome. But instead of paying a title/lender company to prepare this document on paper it can be written into blockchain.

No way the community here is going to give you the answers you want. You will probably have to use your brain and find companies that will share info with you. Like how about tracking all the retailers that accept crypto,which crypto’s and how much do they receive. Sorry to break the news to you but getting individuals in the community to answer your questions is not going to provide suitable research for whatever you are doing.

to clarify, there are many different places you can have a bitcoin address. When you create an exchange account, they provide you with a public bitcoin address where you can send you Bitcoin from other addresses. For example you could have a bitcoin wallet with Coinbase, Kraken, and a cold hardware wallet like the Nano X. All three have bitcoin addresses, but the difference is that when you get a wallet with an exchange, they hold the private key and control access to that address. Hardware and most software wallets  have private keys that only you have access to. This makes them more secure and gives you control over your assets, but it can be more difficult to 'sell' bitcoin. The exchange wallet will enable you to buy and sell bitcoin quickly in a liquid market place. So don't keep more bitcoin in  your exchange wallet than what you want to keep liquid, or hacked.. keep the rest in a 'cold' wallet bitcoin address.

No but your criticism of my comment tells me you don’t know much about the economics of mining. Anyone can call themselves and expert reading a few articles and with some spreadsheets.
@_date: 2019-10-14 21:22:24
It’s not news to me, that’s obviously the situation.  My point being that over time people can learn how to protect themselves from these situations. Don’t you try to learn from mistakes in your own life? Or do you just flip through it and rely on luck and uneducated decisions? Not saying everyone has the capacity to learn from mistakes but lots of people do.

If less volume and price is increasing that means less people selling in proportion to people buying.

Gemini fee to sell back to fiat is very high.
@_date: 2019-10-15 21:50:28
Lol I ignored what? What I see is they are going to spend at least 1 million dollars per MW not even including the miners themselves. A typical build out would cost a fraction of that cost, you can amortize all you want but that’s way too expensive to make money.
@_date: 2019-10-15 16:02:48
You could make this more realistic if you took liquid wealth instead of global wealth. But I doubt that number is known. Doesn’t matter though it’s going to be fine with out absorbing the entire wealth of the world.

Looking back at volume over the last month, this drop isn’t necessarily an outlier. What you saw over the last few weeks was an increase in volume due to the dump on 9/23. I would expect volume to be high trailing out of a major change. When we see volatility I suspect that encourages a lot of speculative trading hence higher volumes for a time. As bitcoins sits in a tight range you will have less volume as all bets at that value have likely been placed..
@_date: 2019-09-07 22:31:22
That makes sense, in application it would require off or side chains.

I think transaction cost would be relative to the value. We can achieve higher deflation with more decimals making the currency more valuable.

Wrong, the price goes up, more people mine. Price goes down, less people mine. If you were correct the price of btc would be at least 40k today

very simple, create coinbase account, tie to your bank account. Once verified, you can send Bitcoin from your existing wallet to the coinbase wallet, you will then be able to exchange for cash and withdrawal to your bank account. Any one giving you different advice is going to be over complicating this task.
