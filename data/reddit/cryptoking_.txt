You missed my point. I’m saying there are far better decentralised options aside from BTC these days. It’s a matter of time before BTC fades and other coins take over. This is only my option I may be completely wrong. But it’s fun to speculate no? And yes I completely understand...

I always send Coinbase to bank and have had no problems. I suggest you write and move banks ASAP.

I sold my skate board to buy BTC.

Relax �� no need to get so heated. Fees are higher so why would people in general who don’t understand or even care about decentralisation switch to it and pay more than they currently are with the ways I mentioned above? All I’m saying is I don’t see why BTC would stay at the top with better tech and eco systems in coming in to place. Surely a matter of time IMHO. ��

This is why BTC isn’t going to last. Fees are higher than PayPal, visa and banks combined. Sorry if the truth hurts.

This is the problem with BTC.

Not all alts are shitcoins. Don’t be a BTC fanboy and miss out on some very good returns... 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:10:45
BTC will lose some holding once less Alts are paired to it as I think people can make better ROI in smaller coins/tokens. Right now BTC is king in most people’s eyes, however so was the horse and cart until cars came along. I think with time BTC will lose its holding. Might be wrong just my opinion. ��

Why not buy silver with BTC as they'll be no capital gains tax? Like a silver £5 coin? Etc 
Might work haven't looked into it enough.

This is the best part of investing. You get to buy coins cheaper. Love the dips. ��
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:57:37
Hold those coins for 3 years plus. Thank me later ��

It's called a "sale".

Good idea bro. I'll do the same thing (starting tomorrow!) ����

I'd like the answer to this question. Haven't seen a cheap method yet...

Wait 4-5 years. This dip will be long forgotten. ��

I use Cryptofoilo app it can track any coin, gives you gains and loses, charts and more. Great app

I think 7% is fair. People have to make a living and no I don’t own a machine.

Look at the long charts of growth. While it's had dips the current trend is upwards. I'm sure we will see 1BTC worth 10k by the end of next year. Maybe more.
