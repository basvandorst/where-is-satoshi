Better than letting money sit idle in the bank anyway

And buy from brokers for 15% more? People in the UK pretty much only have coinbase

I wish there was a better UK alternative
Actually the good thing about Coinbase was that its £500 limit prevented me from FOMOing into the xmas almost ATH prices and instead made me cost average and regular buys until today, so while I lost a lot of money when it went down, I've bought a lot on this dip

@_date: 2019-11-06 13:28:31
I highly doubt they unban exchanges because it would risk popping their own crazy huge bubble which is their cardboard real estate market
Atm people's only way to protect their capital is to either gamble in the heavily manipulated stock market, literally gamble in Macau, exchange for more stable currencies through Hong Kong, buy shitty new builds in China or buy safe properties overseas. Unless you have enough money to buy property overseas then crypto is your best bet

Buy the dip
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:43:20
Lol China banned it last year tho
The reason why they now allow it is because they figured out it's easier to catch people on the block chain than using cash

Can anyone explain what does a bank run mean?

Not true. A lot of wealthy Hong kongers are afraid of getting extradited/wealth taken away/ losing business so they support the protestors under the radar with resources

Yes and you can do more accumulation by actually raising more money on stuff that is moving

Here In London an average 1 bed flat is around 500k. The average wage is 28k before taxes and banks only offer mortgages up to 4x salary lmao good luck with that. An average person needs to save like mad for 20 years just for deposit and hope property doesn't keep rising

If someone has an unstable job, no emergency/stockpiled funds and no other form of income then they shouldn't be having kids in the first place

Not to mention that the EU is always on the headlines from stealing from American companies. Sure this is an occasion where MasterCard is kinda stealing money but most of the time it's just some random law sucking money away.

What are the best sources for crypto talk? In telegram you mostly just see bots asking for premium subscriptions and pump and dump signals
on Youtube there are so many bad channels out there:
- Tevron James, still shilling dat bitconnect. 
- Crypto investor, the FUD in this guy is real. For someone with crypto in the name this guy really wants to make it go down
- Tai Lopez, yea dude we get it, your online marketing makes money but you cant just jump onto the next buzzword
- The brodog channel that i even forgot the name, what are these guys even saying
There are a few very good channels that I follow regularly and they give good advice:
- Crypto Bobby, always giving a lot of fundamentals
- Cryptobud, this is more of a technical dude but his positive outlook definitely kept me from banging my head against the wall
- Doug Poulk, he's the best at going through the news 
I'm very neutral on crypto oracle, he sometimes gives good advice but he spends far too much time being snobby promoting his paid programs

I have no problem in telling the world which venues I go to, chances are that you're likely to find an asian,black, indian, blonde, woman, homosexual, etc individuals at the same time. In fact such venues would actually pay me for the promotion
If your grandma went to a white only place then she knew very well where she was getting herself into, regardless of whether or not other people accepted it. Social contexts are not laws, you can freely think for yourself

I've bought a vibrator for my ex before. If anyone asks me about it, I will be happy to explain the benefits of it
If the employer cares more about where I spend my own money on my free time rather than the money that I make for him then I would be most happy to leave such a misprioritized individual

Atm the cheapest fee on that website is £100 more than on coinbase for the whole UK
If you're looking at "just" London, then the difference is £500. 
I'll stick with coinbase thx

You have such a compelling argument, did your middle school classmate use that argument on you today?
@_date: 2018-02-20 15:03:19
I'm not lucky at all, I started at the rock bottom and worked my ass developing myself and my skills in a completely new country.
The only point I'm trying to make is that employers won't ever need to spy or look for excuses to fire an employee as long as the employee is bringing value. I'm not sure about in other countries but here in the UK it is very easy to sack someone with no need whatsoever to waste time on such activities

Well I've got a MSc and been busting my balls here without much success
People here like to hate on Tai Lopez but he's right, knowledge is power and reading and learning from videos online are a must. However to get that initial investment for real estate, stocks or even business opportunities, you just can't do that with making average money

So weed stocks?
That's my alternative to nvidia
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:53:20
Okay so you're saying that the courses advertised by Tai are "scammy" because Tai isn't a big crypto guru himself. You know that he's not the one giving the actual courses right?

Maybe I do have a bias, I'd like you to prove me wrong by getting me setup with a canadian weed stock trading exchange from the UK where my face doesn't get eaten alive by fees

So if I dont cashout and just hodl, I don't need to pay taxes where I pay my normal income tax

Japanese food makes me happy, not just because of taste but also a lot of proteins. I do need to over eat otherwise I would be in a calorie deficit. It's hard for me to bulk up when compared to a normal person. I don't know where you live but in London it's very hard to eat cheap, much less eating a sizeable portion for cheap. Just a can of Pringles alone is £2.50
I regularly for dinner get the 3 for £10 at m&amp;s and I need to snack a lot and eat fruit on top of that
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:54:46
@_date: 2018-02-27 18:23:56
So my home country actually does not tax crypto. I'll just cash out there, cool
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:37:53
I'm not making even 400 week after tax. But I did have some money because again, I've worked for almost 2 years
I just know that at under my current circumstances I will never buy a house, esp when deposits start at 50k. Not even if I get promoted to say 40k. That's why I feel like I need to take the risk on crypto.

I agree with all you said except for the social media part. Youtube has become a staple, Twitter is now where even top presidents go to, businesses and individuals thrive off Instagram, we're on reddit,  in a lot of times Facebook is now ruined by the older generation getting a hold of it and vine is dead
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:50:53
I just asked on this thread 
Apparently they are just banning on credit, not on debit. I don't have to change banks yet
@_date: 2018-02-25 11:24:24
Try again later. I heard it was visa mistake not the bank
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:47:12
It does depending on their bias
My point is that social media at least encourages people to find multiple influencers rather than some centralized biased information source 
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:52:48
So is coinbase still better?
@_date: 2018-02-27 14:17:48
How small is small enough? What small is to one individual is a fortune to another

go away troll
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:45:57
Well I sold it at 7k then missed the bottom and rebought at like 6.8k. With the coinbase fees I lost 0.05 bitcoin in total. I should've just stayed put
Not all have access to cheap fees/are skilled enough to trade properly

Maybe try it on korea sub

I don't know how to cook and ingredients are pretty expensive anyway. Just some chicken breast is £4 alone
I used to save money on food and just have instant noodles and an apple when I was a student, now I need huge portions. Screw the tesco sandwich that everyone else has

Isn't Binance big enough to make top7?

Okay I guess I'm the avocado eating millennial who can't buy a house because I spend too much on avocados (according to London evening standard newspaper...I don't even buy avocados but ok)
It's just that millennials are pretty much always portrayed negatively on the media. Maybe that's a good sign that the mainstream media now caters for the old generation. The younger generation learns to do their own research instead of being sheep... Or they spend their time on social media instead which is probably still better than mainstream news outlets

As much as I want to see Bitcoin succeed, I'd actually advise against supporting countries such as Russia and Qatar for violating human rights and all the descrimination going on in them. They need to be boycotted so that corrupted FIFA stops going for the highest bidder

Still not sure what the definition of millenial is but buying litecoin is as simple as downloading Coinbase and pressing buy

"it dropped down it must've been manipulated!!!" vs "bitcoin is bubble, dropping is normal"
"it went up!! it must've been manipulated" vs "bitcoin is undervalued of course it goes up"
