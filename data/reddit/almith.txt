This is actually rather new. Just in time to execute my master plan?

Match IDs could be something created by the website. The website could locate each player in the match, look at the game they all played together, then Determine who won, then distribute winnings.

I'm not sure what's going on. but it's been a good 16 hours and i've yet to officially hear anything.

I've seen a similar bill here in ga. Funny stuff.

No one listen to this guy. He's obviously some spam bot promoting the website he linked.

It doesn't look like they've been hacked. I got my coins earlier today. You should have yours now, as well.

Merry Christmas!  
  
  I have been ranting and raving Bitcoin for a good month now. These southern folk have a difficult time understanding the serious effectiveness of Bitcoin.

Thank you! I'm glad someone seen potential in this post despite my terrible wording, which will be fixed once I get off work. I'm also going to look more into this guy.

Exactly. Validating wins would be fairly easy to implement since all games  played are publicly visible. You can see everyone who played in the match and various other stats for said match.

I just opened up a ticket. The support for crypsy is on the bottom of the cryptsy website. Just click "support" and open a ticket. Let's hope we get our coins back!

The price will depend on a plethora of variables. Labor for coding? Are you doing it yourself? Are you going to maintain your own servers? You'll need expert coders to ensure the security features are top notch. You'll need some people to maintain customer service, etc.  
I would say the price would fluctuate most based off what cryptos you include initially. As you can tell, crypsy is being pooped on with all of the unexpected traffic.  But I'm no expert, and these are just a few concerns.    I would guess about $50,000.

This also happened to me a couple hours earlier when attempting to sell Points. The balance for the respective coin just went zero when i clicked confirm sell order. Didn't think anything of it till QRK did the same.
