And how do you control the money supply of cryptos like btc? With memes about real currency? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:36:25
Why are you holding? Are you expecting an increasing demand?
What would fuel that demand? Hate of authority? 
@_date: 2018-09-04 21:24:18
Like the Euro? :D

Really? I thought the value of money comes from the fact that everyone considers it a legal tender.


So why can't you buy milk with bitcoin? Why can you only buy heroin and fake passports with it? Are you sure people chose to use bitcoin as a currency? Because there does not seem to be anything for sale anywhere for crypto.

Actually thats the defintion of fiat money. As soon as the guvment makes a law naming btc a legal tender it becomes fiat money because there is no commodity backing it.


this sentence makes no sense :)

What you guys do is financial scientology. Just read all this bullshit with a rational mind.

Not without the ability of controlling the money supply by a certain *authority*. 
I understand you dislike every kind of authority, but we are talking about a real life use of bitcoin which is impossible as long as the price level is affected by everything apart from the interest of a nation or economy.
Mate, we both know who is controlling the money supply. Asian miners. So this means the crypto utopia is about swapping the democratically chosen financial experts (who are in control of money supply) to some chinese money laundering criminals.
Good luck!

Are you guys aware that if bitcoin becomes a currency of a nation it also becomes "fiat money" by definition?
Seems like the hatred towards fiat money is kinda ridiculous if you look it this way :) 
@_date: 2018-09-02 23:15:24
Lets say I am an idiot. Can you tell me what is backing bitcoin?
Please note that your answer has to be better than "the entire nation's economy and every member of it, private companies, households and the government"
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:43:11
what is backing bitcoin? your endless hatred of authority? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:07:55
good to know that the fsb is after cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2018-09-05 13:02:37
Money is worth as much as the goods you can buy with it. This is not about faith and believing. 
You mention things like "borderless, permissionless, decentralized" like its a good thing for an economy's currency. Well every money is borderless, apart from that. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 12:22:02
No matter how much bullshit you spew on regular money, you will still lose a lot of **money** for holding btc half a year after the crypto "market" saturated.
@_date: 2018-09-03 12:56:16
lol no
@_date: 2018-09-03 03:36:17


All right, lets see then how this implicit control works for you guys :)
One year ago btc was 3.900 USD
Two months later in december it reached 19.000 USD
In february it dipped under 7.000 USD
A week later it was 11.000 USD
Again under 7.000 USD in april
Then it reached 9.000 in the same month
Lets say your country has bitcoin as currency, yet the other countries you compete with have FIAT which are as stagnant as the Euro or Dollar.
Lets say the product your country makes is a car which costs 1 BTC including the profit margin. A year ago you can export a car for 3900 USD, which was 1 BTC. Two months later your country goes bankrupt because no sane person pays 19000 USD for a car which is worth 3900 USD. Your entire economy falls apart. End of the example.

It still has a better chance to getting adopted by countries. 
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:20:03
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:44:10
if a country would use a crypto as a currency it would immediately become a FIAT currency so maybe think it through
@_date: 2018-09-04 22:18:29
you guys are like financial scientologists
@_date: 2018-09-04 23:01:18


No mate, thats not only true to fiat money. That statement is true to EVERY money. Fiat money is a subset of all money, and that statement is true to every kind of currency in human history and currencies of the future too. 
What? You say it is not true for bitcoin? Well mate, thats why you would starve to death if you only had btc and no fiat currency :) Thats why you can't even buy a baguett with it. 


First of all, no, it is not pre determined, it is determined by how many mining there are currently. This is why it will never be adopted as a standalone currency. A nation cannot base the economy on chinese server farms. A nation cannot afford to let its currency be supplied by server farms. Imagine the 2008 mortgage crisis if the US couldn't break the inflation... Ah wait, you know what its like, since the btc you own often drops 30-70% in a week :)


No, it can only be tied to supply and demand. Fiat money is correlating with gdp because the CB can control the money supply. Noone can control the money supply of btc. 


No and stop this religious bullshit. BTC has only one use, you can buy it and you can pray for it to go up for no apparent reason whatsoever. 
Financial scientology.

Tell me, what is backing bitcoin?
