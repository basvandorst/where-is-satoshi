Are they managing to stay afloat with the electricity/mining output, or are they taking the short L and going for the long pull?

Zoom out say.. 5 years. If trends stick, I can buy a rocket ship.

If you guys really don't trust each other, I would ask for a very small amount of cash, and transfer BTC. Then go up incrementally. Generally you meet in a coffee shop, somewhere with people. Usually the BTC price for LBTC is higher as well. That's the best method for literal cold hard cash, I don't know any other method that let's you get hard cash

Well I don't live in Netherlands so I'm not sure how people are like over there. But it's legit. 
@_date: 2019-03-03 18:51:57
Localbitcoins if you want solid cash and you have lots of them I guess. 
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:55:44
buy it, mine it, lightning network, peer to peer it, and talk about it with your friends every chance you get
@_date: 2019-06-06 15:24:11
How do you make that happen? Asking for a friend
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:47:31

@_date: 2019-06-04 14:39:13
meanwhile, I lose a fifth of my portfolio..
@_date: 2019-02-28 08:37:36
Pretty much anytime anyone says other crypto than btc.. because btc is alpha race 
@_date: 2019-06-10 02:10:55
It'll be interesting to speculate. Only time will tell
@_date: 2019-02-28 08:19:51
Wow that's.. wow?

Welcome to hodl gang, keep it strong fam
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:06:56
I can imagine whales doing it for april fools joke, and then everyone fomoing afterwards
@_date: 2019-04-02 05:07:39
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:42:42
highly convenient actually. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:12:20
why sell for fiat if fiat inflation won't outlast bitcoin. HODL or buy more
@_date: 2019-01-25 07:35:53
Poor frogs. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 16:19:01
Next up, the apple wallet?
@_date: 2019-01-25 16:45:32
They probably just don't have enough money.
@_date: 2019-01-24 22:54:47
Well if you're asking this you probably aren't a whale and shouldn't be too worried. If you are a whale, msg me your private keys, I'll keep them safe for you so you won't have to go through the torture and ransom :)

Newcomers generally learn what NOT to do; e.g. buy high, sell low, taking financial advice on anonymous forums, etc.

Hopefully this won't affect adoption? 
@_date: 2019-01-29 20:33:29
Is bitcoin considered "foreign currency"?
@_date: 2019-01-24 20:42:13
This is actually pretty cool
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:27:15
How to buy? Where to buy? Where is it? Safe? And in my opinion, most importantly, how to use? 
@_date: 2019-01-16 07:02:50
I legit thought this was the creator of Bitcoin's wallet for a second 
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:01:28
There needs to be a whale or miner of some sort of to give them some kickstart by paying them for labor at least. Bitcoins don't grow from trees 
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:52:37
Can I buy this with bitcoin
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:05:17

@_date: 2019-05-30 16:03:37
Just always buy regardless of the price, easy win
@_date: 2019-05-06 22:42:13
Lol 
Gov: bitcoins are now illegal, I will now confiscate them. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:23:46
mining is less profitable; less btc per block mined by half 
@_date: 2019-05-02 05:07:34
pft, only?
@_date: 2018-12-27 20:58:35
like how coinbase has their bitcoins? 
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:02:08
PSA. Give me your keys, I keep it safe from you losing it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:14:24
