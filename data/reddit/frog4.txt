There's definitely substantial migration of capital happening via Bitcoin; however I believe Bitcoin is often just the means rather than the end, as it offers a way to get around capital controls. Put another way, some people don't care so much about Bitcoin but use it just to move their money in or out of the country. I also believe that there could be substantial money laundering going on via south american countries. Moving dirty money (perhaps even stolen bicoins) into physical assets etc.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:53:04
Money goes through checkpoints for precisely this reason. Bitcoin isn't the first or the last way to move your money around underneath the table. You either declare what you own and pay tax, or you hide it from the government, in which case if they catch you you will be in deep shit.

@_date: 2014-01-31 12:48:27
Right... That's good, so it doesn't require 3rd party servers like Mycelium. I guess what I want security wise is:
* Backs up encrypted copy of wallet to cloud, never stores private keys locally on disk.
* Decrypts wallet on the fly, is able to be decrypted optionally via 2 different methods (passphrase / biometric reading / usb security dongle)
* Ideally has some way of protecting memory space. Perhaps by never allocating memory for the keys and always passing by value. I'm at the edge of my CS knowledge as you can see though!
* Oh, and different clients.
I think blockchain.info is the closest to this, currently.

It's very naive to think that Bitcoin is ready to solve the world's problems. The elephant in the room is wealth disparity. Bitcoin is owned by a very small population, a tiny fraction of whom own the majority of it... This would need to be resolved.

@_date: 2013-11-28 13:34:50
That's because Bitcoin hasn't been very long and because it is so awesome. Like I said, these technologies are in their infancy. Bitcoin is a technological obra maestra, there are extremely few instances where you will see something of that novelty and complexity take off first time round to the extent that Bitcoin has. The fact that little progress has been made in diversification has to do with Bitcoin's apparent competence, security, and lack of real world effects that highlight it's real flaws.

What a load of crap... Waaaah litecoin is going to eat into our market share. Litecoin and other altcoins represent diversity. Some of them also have really good reasons to exist. For one reason or another, bitcoin _may not work_, but if that happens would you rather have a functioning alternative ready or not? You'd probably rather that chaos ensued just so you got a shot at owning a large chunk of it's successor. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:10:30
Yep... Actually they're well placed to do amazing things with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:05:29
A serious technical issue or vulnerability would just promote more diversity in underlying technologies, and potentially the private creation of financial instruments that are backed by different cryptos. They also are alternatives because they may not be affected by bad decisions that bitcoin makes in the future. Protocols will evolve and remember these currencies are still in their infant stages. 
@_date: 2013-10-05 07:58:14
Yes, safe because you trust a majority instead of any single actor. At the present moment there is one blockchain and a very primitive client. Both of those things can and probably will change... For example, at some point I expect that there will be a pluggable client that supports "apps" that interact with the blockchain, so there could be a bitcoin app store of sorts. Down the line, these apps could consume social data, and interesting things would start to happen.

He may not understand how it works, but I think his point is that its too unstable due to lack of a controllable money supply, not that its insecure. Which is a valid problem but can be fixed where necessary see eg mastercoin.

I'm pretty sure that bitcoin bubbles will become smaller and less frequent as it gains public awareness. 
@_date: 2013-09-23 01:21:40
If eventually the asymmetric cryptography algorithm used to secure the address is compromised, people who have bitcoins will need to migrate to a newer version of the protocol and the remaining coins (from slow people and lost wallets) will be hoovered up by scavengers. This would be a small disaster...
@_date: 2013-11-04 00:37:00
I suppose because in the Bitcoin world there is no repercussions of doing so; with a credit card you can't just go around reversing all your spends, you'll get done for fraud, and your purchases are linked strongly to your identity. Bitcoin is more like cash in this regard; anonymous given proper precautions. Would you accept cash if it could be reversed? Right now there's probably loads of shops in small towns in Germany who accept unconfirmed coins, but if it became mainstream then this kind of petty crime would become commonplace in the real world.

@_date: 2013-10-05 08:07:14
Actually, I should qualify this by saying that the relevant actors here are the miners, so if and when people start trying to exert social influence to the blockchain, hash power is going to become way more valuable.
@_date: 2013-10-05 08:16:58
Yes.. But as you know, they wouldn't need to keep a majority share for very long to make it extremely difficult for the other side to catch up.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:22:30
But, a 0day vulnerability that was sufficiently difficult to correct could cause a partial (or complete) migration away from Bitcoin. In this instance, diversity will be a good thing, because there may be alternate cryptocurrencies that don't have the same issues already present. This is the reason that diversity should be encouraged, to hedge against potential issues.
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:56:38


This isn't really the case. And even if someone declares an address lost, you can't really know for sure. So there is no metric for coins in circulation, that takes into account lost wallets.
@_date: 2013-10-26 09:04:17
Why never? It should be noted that it's only 3 short months since mining became unprofitable, which in many cases is longer than asic order time; theoretically it should balance out eventually.

You are referring to a 51% attack. The attack I am referring to is simply to spend the same money twice at the same time, where one of these transactions will later be invalidated when the other gets confirmed.
tl;dr: Don't be a condescending dickhead if you haven't done your reading.

"redeem" according to OED: 2. gain or regain possession of (something) in exchange for payment.
I can buy a wide variety of things in exchange for bitcoin, including fiat money. So it is redeemable for many things.  There's really no difference between trusting that a bank will give me gold for my money and trusting that a retailer will give me bread. The argument you're making is that only a currency issuer is allowed to "back" a currency, which seems like an arcane semantic issue and adds little to the conversation.
@_date: 2013-10-21 09:11:11
That's true, but in the short term, media surprise at bitcoin's price increase could see demand rise substantially.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:34:20
This is a good point. I bought at 29 dollars 2 bubbles ago, then it crashed, of course I felt burned and lost interest. However, in retrospect I totally wish I'd kept buying post crash price.
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:31:00
Yes. That's what people mean by "remove bitcoin's fungiblity". Actually it wouldn't split it in 2, money would be various levels of shady, and that would affect it's value.
@_date: 2013-10-13 23:12:50
I think his point is that instability can be compensated when you do have control of supply. Which is an example application written about in the white paper for mastercoin. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:26:37
I think a fractional reserve bitcoin bank is a cool idea, as long as people knew what they were getting into. Coinkite explicitly states full reserve. I don't think it would counter deflation at all though, if anything it would increase demand as people don't borrow with intent to hold; they borrow to spend, which then translates into network effect and thus value. 
@_date: 2013-11-02 10:46:05

Mainly that it's scarcity precludes it from entering the consumer space. It'll be more like a reserve currency and/or savings vehicle for the masses.

I agree with you, although I don't think the altcoins are doing quite enough yet. PPCoin with proof of stake is very good as a green alternative but I'd be more interested in coins that use other cryptographic methods for security.
@_date: 2013-11-02 16:02:24
Currencies are all basically backed by confidence in their spending power. If a currency is backed by gold, that's really only saying that people have confidence in the spending power of gold, and they trust the bank to swap the note for gold.
Similarly, a bank could issue notes which represented bitcoin. They wouldn't need to have private keys on them, they could just say: "i promise to pay the bearer on demand the sum of 1 bitcoin". Then if you wanted to get the bitcoin you could go to the bank. But, if everyone uses the notes, that's no longer neccesary because people believe in the medium itself.

It also doesn't take a majority to fragment a blockchain. If a government cuts all international network links, bam, bitcoin is (almost) nationalised and value of the coins would also diverge.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:57:36
Actually this isn't completely accurate; bitcoin has a problem which is that small transactions can go unconfirmed, and larger transactions that depend on them therefore also don't get confirmed. I believe this is due to larger transactions taking priority over smaller ones. This should be fixed before long though.

@_date: 2013-10-05 08:53:26
Right, perhaps what I didnt understand is that its not the protocol that is vulnerable to mischief, its what happens if a majority decide to change the protocol of their client. People would be forced to do change their protocol for example if a weakness was found in one of the hashing algorithms. But it could also be done for other reasons. And if a majority does it, the old protocol doesn't really matter since the blockchain would be successfully forked. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 16:16:42
Threat of a 51% attack is incentive for users to pay higher transaction fees as incentive for more mining. Or even mine themselves. People will have to pay for their security, and the way will probably have to be led by organisations large enough to move the needle on their own.

I think the variables are difficult to predict. When there's no more block reward, transaction fees will have to go up and network hash power will likely come down. The question is if it comes down far enough for it to be economically feasible to attack the network. In the future there could be 10 or 50 times as many transactions to profit from, and for any nation to depend on it in any meaningful way you can be that they'll put in place strategies to protect their populations. Perhaps it'll fall under military budget.

@_date: 2013-10-05 08:15:08
It's not undoing the blockchain. It's just agreeing on validity of a transaction.... For example, a majority could craft a transaction that splits evenly the funds in an address between them. It might not be recognised as legal by the other clients (for lack of a signature of the owner), but if they refuse to acknowledge it then their own spending power goes down too.

You're right, they will. However, there's alot more security in a passphrase than a password, assuming there are many more words in the dictionary than there are characters.
The maths looks (something) like this:
If a wallet generates a passphrase from a set dictionary of about 4,000 words, then that's 12 bits of security per word, multiplied by 12 words = 144 bits of security. In contrast, a 12 character password, given lowercase, uppercase, numeric and punctuation, is more like 6.4 bits of security per character and thus 77 bits for the whole password. Still extremely difficult to crack.
This is also why using a passphrase from a book is insecure; it reduces the search space to however many sentences can be extracted from books, which is still only about 32 bits of security.

Why don't they just use bitpay then?

It probably won't go back to that low.

I would not recommend trying this as bitcoin has no native way to do it, and therefore it will be up to you to make sure that your custom solution is secure, and it won't be very easy. It is an interesting idea though perhaps bitcoin could support scriptable addresses in the future.

I must have given the impression that I was advocating such an idea. I'm not, I just wanted discussion about it. It's naive to think that there will not exist struggle for control of this currency in the future, and corruption of the blockchain is one thing that could happen.

This article was not praising bitcoin at all, the whole thing was about it's use in the black market.
