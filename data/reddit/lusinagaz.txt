Sounds like quite an adventure. However imagine for a moment that coconuts are scarce. In that case your story reaches a premature end: instead of showing you how to play coconut pool, the locals use those bamboo sticks to poke holes in you...

Except that politicians' jobs rely on making plenty of random noise!

Biased... towards facts

Much simpler than that: Clearly everyone is buying btc as a last minute Christmas gift. Too late for amazon delivery, shops are packed to the hilt... what is going on with the world?!!

Sounds like  is the conference you've been waiting for!

I did think. I thought: gbp has dropped at least 10 percent in the last month. But my btc has remained at around the same price even after the halving. 
So by my own subjective measure of volatility (number 2 in your helpful list, thank you), I think my general point still stands, namely that comparing Bitcoin volatility to a Grandpa's asshole's painting skills is a little unfair on Bitcoin. 
I didn't realise people took these comments so seriously... Next time I'll make sure to spend my afternoon fact checking.

There's a subtle difference in that Bitcoin is *actually* more stable than the pound. Whereas I would wager that no matter how gifted your grandpa is, his asshole is not *actually* a better painter than Pollock. 
But then I've never met your grandpa.
