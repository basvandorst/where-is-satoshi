The owners almost have to be doing an inside job on this. I wait until over a period of an hour since the last round where someone won, thinking that there is less of a possibility that other people are playing. Then when I bet every time literally 5 seconds later someone else places a bet. Even when they pot is at .04 you still get .02, the same payout when only 1 person bets. Therefore it really doesn't make sense to bet when the pot is low and someone else bets because of the greater chance that the person will counter bet and or make a betting war.

Most gift card reselling websites like cardpool and raise don't buy Amazon gift cards. The only one I could find that does is giftcardzen and they only pay $.68 cents on the dollar. Also when you sell on and accept paypal as payment, you run a very high risk that someone will do a chargeback.

If card is linked to Coinbase account does it have access to just the balance on the account or does it have the ability to instant buy btc and spend that?

It looks like the 180 day dispute rule will only apply to users registered in the UK.
Quote from June 17th anticipated policy change.
"Open a Dispute within 45 days (or, if you are claiming as a registered UK resident user of PayPal, 180 days)of the date on which you made the payment for the purchase you would like to dispute"

It's not working for me. I went to sell a sbux card, it automatically detected the balance, and when I hit the button displaying the btc amount to accept the offer it just takes me back to the enter gift card screen. It doesn't ask me for a wallet address or email.

Even though stuff at Overstock is more than Amazon, I'd rather pay more and give them my bitcoin.

This is not a scam. I am in no way affiliated with them, but I have sold Starbucks gift cards to them in the past and gotten paid in btc in a timely manner.

Bitmit's claim was it was too stressful running the site and the final straw was when an unauthorized employee of the company that provided the servers for the site stole something to the tune 15 btc around when one was trading for $150. for Coingig it was likely I think due to all the laws in the US since the site seemed to be based out of Miami. There are special licenses for money transmitters, holding customer funds in escrow, etc.

And btw my dodge offer in chrome was 40k and 131k in firefox for the same gift card.

Do they possibly have more than 96 cents on the dollar retained for this transaction since they saved money by paying lower transaction fees? Anyone know do non-profits get a break from traditional credit card processors or do the relentless CC companies still take a 2-3% processing fee?

Though I disagree with points made by Bitcoin pundits like Krugman and Mark Williams, at least they are making in ways quantifiable arguments. This Hess guy's argument is just a blind adherence to the US constitution without reasoning or common sense. 
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:07:49
Patrick thanks for your response. I suppose I was being a bit narrow minded when I said things cost more but in my experience they mostly do.  For example I cringed buying from Amazon but bought a pair of Clarks Bushacre 2 boots from them for $68 on 8/29. The price on overstock? $108.99, not even close. Even when I bought the Ray-Ban New Wayfarers for a little over a $100 I saw the exact same thing on Amazon for $70. However I did find a book cheaper on Overstock than Amazon once. 
Also any response to the fact that most US customers buy btc through Coinbase where there is a 1% fee and could Overstock offer a slightly lower price for btc purchases like Amagi metals does?

Not referring to Roger, but now maybe everyone who has swindled, scammed, or stolen bitcoins will choose this island as an exile refuge. 
On another hand, even though the citizenship price is prohibitive for most, would be cool if it became sort of a bitcoin island like other people have hoped would happen somewhere.

I think it was around this time last year that bitmit shut down, not that cryptothrift appears to be shutting down. I remember bitmit claimed they lost around 15 btc too(when btc was at around $100/btc). Bitmits claim was that a rogue employee of the sites hosted servers used root privileges or something to access the hot wallet.

For me personally it's hard to justify purchasing on Overstock, especially with bitcoin. 
First off I'm just out of college so I don't have a huge disposable income, but items on Overstock seem to be 20-30% more than the same thing on Amazon or Ebay. I have bought things like Ray-Bans for example with btc on Overstock when I could have gotten them 30% cheaper on Amazon, just to support Overstock. But besides stuff costing 20% more, I buy btc through Coinbase so there is a 1% fee ontop. 
I support and want to use Bitcoin and reward Overstock for their pioneering acceptance of btc but I feel like they should have more of an incentive to pay with Bitcoin there.
@_date: 2014-03-07 01:37:59
Isn't the whole goal of bitcoin to reach a point when enough transaction fees per block come through to provide a mining incentive not dependent on newly generated coins?

Starbucks allows you to look up the date when the card was activated, using the card number and pin. If  card was just activated and someone wants to immediately sell it, that raises a flag, but a used card activated over a month ago should be good.

It also says for me at least( I have lvl II verification) that you can buy now at market price and delivery will be on Friday 11/22. Interestingly it says you can cancel at anytime until Friay so I was thinking of buying and then if the price goes down just cancel it. Win-Win?

I went to do a checkout for a $75 Exxon Mobile gift card and the shipping charge is $9.99. Your Faq page says this

First Class Mail at a cost of $2.95 per order is included in the total."

I think they may have made the wait after a first bitcoin purchase longer now to become lvl II verified. It used to be a ten day wait period I believe because I bought 8 days ago and I was 3 days away from being lvl II verified but not it's showing I have to wait 22 more days.

Yeah but sometimes the charge back is delayed so I could withdraw the money and since my paypal would be tied a fully anonymous bank account and if there is no money in it paypal couldn't really seize any money from me.

I would like to see voluntary limiting of daily buy amounts. Right now I have no need to buy up to 10 BTC daily and would like to limit it to a lower amount in case my account is compromised/laptop stolen.
