Curious, how did you use it as an indicator?  I don't trade, but just want to know your thought process.
@_date: 2019-07-18 18:41:12
It depends on the fee set for the transaction, how many other transactions are competing in the mempool for processing, etc.
You can use this website to determine how many Satoshi's are needed to process your transaction within X mount of blocks -

Nope.  You'll need to send BTC from your hardware wallet to Wasabi, run the mixing, and send back to your hardware wallet.

So, Monero?
There isn't anything remotely private that will happen for Bitcoin. 
Arguably, the mixing/coinjoin function from Wasabi wallet is compromised, according to Samourai wallet devs. But I'm not here to start a flame war as to which wallet is better or w/e.

1. Bitcoin obtained via P2P transaction.
2. Create a throw-away Binance account using your VPN.
3. Deposit Bitcoin into Binance address.
4. Trade Bitcoin to w/e coin you want
5. Withdrawal coin to preferred wallet/address.
@_date: 2019-07-17 14:47:01
Most/all hardware wallets include generating a QR code for a wallet address that you own.
You can take that QR code, scan it as the receiving address from the BTM and skip Coinbase altogether. No need to use a middle man that tracks all your transactions.
You'll be paying the BTM fee + a Coinbase withdrawal fee(unless you move the funds to the Coinbase Pro platform) to get your Bitcoin to your hardware wallet. Your method would be costly/inefficient/having a third party track your transactions because you decided to deposit into their platform.

On the Ledger hardware wallet for example - 
When you select to receive Bitcoin, the Ledger will provide you a BTC address and simultaneously provide a QR code associated with that address. Take that QR code, cut it using Snipping Tool and send the image to your phone. Open the image of the QR code from your phone, have the BTM scan the QR code, and you're on your way.
No, it does not compromise your hardware wallet as you are just telling the BTM where to send the Bitcoin by providing a QR code to scan instead of having to type out your BTC address. The few ways your hardware wallet could be potentially compromised is by someone knowing your seed associated with your hardware wallet allowing them to spend your Bitcoin, malware, or someone having physical access to potentially hack/trick the hardware wallet into allowing them access.

Bitcoin is the first, largest, most secure blockchain in the crypto-world.
Bitcoin cash is a fork of Bitcoin that wanted to solve the scaling issue with larger blocks. Bitcoin Cash is run by Roger Ver (read scammer) and is basically a pump and dump scheme behind the guise of larger blocks = more transactions. 
If it's not called Bitcoin, it's not Bitcoin. That's how easy this is.

Ah ok, I found it.
I don't see why this wouldn't be a bad thing? The only issues I have right now is that this is the first time I'm hearing of this wallet. 
Second, the website is broken. A broken website screams potential scam to me. Things aren't aligned, page aspects are jerky for some reason? I don't know.
Also, the Ledger Nano X already does what the Ellipal does with connecting to your phone for spending/storing, but with a few years ahead and the Ledger name behind the product.
@_date: 2019-07-19 17:11:36
Ok so then they are in a different timezone for their site.
Either way, you'll have to wait, or replace by fee to process your transaction faster.

That's what Bitcoin does.
1. Download Bitcoin software/available third party wallets(at the time).
2. Get Bitcoin, send to your wallet. Maybe mix the coins for extra "privacy".
3. Get dealer's BTC address, send BTC to their address.
4. Buy drugs off silk road.
To your escrow situation.  "Trusted" people were used as escrow services. They would take a fee for their service. You can find this all over old posts on Bitcointalk.org and other forums.
Edit: This would be what you're looking for, but this is obviously developed way after Silk Road -

This is worthless because unless you plan on building a GPU rig to mine other coins to trade to Bitcoin, you cannot use the GPU rig to mine Bitcoin as it will be inefficient.
Additionally, all the coins mentioned except Monero are currently using ASICs to mine the network, making your mining rig even more worthless.
Also, have fun mining and getting an ROI probably never or in 3-5 years.

If it's been sent to the mempool and hasn't been processed, depending on your wallet, you can do a "replace by fee" which will push an additional fee to your transaction that allows it to be processed faster.
If your wallet doesn't have this, then you'll just have to wait.  Your transaction will process eventually, don't worry and don't use an "accelerator".
Edit: This website ( is a great resource to determine the fee for transactions and in approximately how many blocks your transaction will potentially process.

Ah, I only said don't use an accelerator because I've never heard of one actively being spoken about. I've always known about "replace by fee", and thought an accelerator was some scam version of that.
Also replace by fee is easier, and is integrated into almost every common BTC wallet.
Edit: researching "accelerators" those websites look scammy as fuck, *and* require a higher fee when compared to using "replace by fee".

But... it's going to be like that regardless. It's either the establishment pays the fee, but pass the fee to you in other ways like higher product prices, or you pay the small fee to move the money.
I don't see why you're complaining, it's happening regardless.
Would you prefer to pay your own set fee, or have a standard fee? For example, would you pay 1 sat to move your BTC, or would you pay Bitmain 5 sat to have your btc moved faster? I'd rather set my own fee than have to pay the Visa/Mastercard/Bitmain swipe fee.
