Thanks. I'm learning so much tonight. A thank you to all of you guys. I've got alot of paper, might go that route for now. I'm watching bitcoinwisdom right now. Wtf is going on on the right hand side?

What do you mean? And why
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:54:26
There's has to be a cheaper way.. Looks cool. There's got to be a way of turning a rpi zero into something like this

I have a strong stomach, I guess you could say. I mentioned extra money which means it's extra and I will not cry about it if I lose money. I've watch bitcoin grow from $30 to now. I have been watching from the sidelines for about a year. Just now getting serious about 'investing'. But thanks for the insight.

So, how do I go about moving my money off line? Google is my friend, I know..

Yeah I'm installing now. I've got an extra 350 gigs. It's syncing now 7 years 12 weeks behind. Guess I have to wait until it finishes to link my wallet
@_date: 2017-02-28 05:21:10
Wow, I'm amazed at the amount of help. I wish I could find this in real life, not on the Internet. Cheers reddit, cheers.

So, kitchen core is synchronizing with the network.. I'm not seeing how to add my wallet /funds or link anything. Send and receive is all I really see. Am I missing something obvious? Can I transfer funds to say.. A usb drive or do I need all 100+ gigs. I'm trying man.
