this sounds like something you would see in the dogecoin subreddit.
we know that bitcoin is deflationary and its value will appreciate. but we do not know when that will happen and neither do you. 
we also know that bitcoin is way too hard for the mainstream. mainstream adoption, if it ever happens, is at least a decade away.
As for the solution to the blocksize problem that's called lightning and non of us here are contributing to that. It's the blockstream and blockchain.info guys who are doing all that work. We just like to post memes and do propaganda.

Somebody had the same idea as the OP i.e. this was a bitcoin private key. That person then sends money to the corresponding address just to mess with everybody. Note that the transaction occurs after the tweet so it could have been anybody.
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:34:02
It's a temporary thing. A bandage if you will. Sidechannels will allow for much faster confirmation without needing to trust anybody so these sort of centralized services will not be needed.
BTW there is an [excellent video]( of Garzik's presentation at a bitcoin conference. He discusses various aspects of the max blocksize debate and he says that if you set it too high or too low you will get centralization. Too high and few people can afford to run a full node. Too low and confirmations take too long so people turn to centralized clearing houses like bitgo.

A private key is just a really large number. Like that hexadecimal number that snowden posted. For each private key there is a corresponding public key. The private key has to be kept secret while the public key can be made public. It is not possible to derive the private key from the public key. The private key is used to sign bitcoin transactions. The signature can be verified by the world at large using the corresponding public key. When you run the public key through hashing functions you get a bitcoin address. The address is also public and can be shared with everyone. Anyone can send money to a bitcoin address (and no one can stop them from doing so) but only the person with the private key can spend the bitcoins.
So it's like this:
private key &gt; public key &gt; bitcoin address.
If you have the private key you can derive the public key and bitcoin address. So with that in mind go to bitaddress.org and click on the wallet details tab. Enter the large hexadecimal number from the OP (ffdae96f8dd292374a966ec8b57d9cc680ce1d23cb7072c522efe32a1a7e34b0) there. You will see two bitcoin addresses listed one for the compressed public key and one for the uncompressed public key:
A compressed public key is just a public key with some redundant information removed. This results in a different address however both compressed and uncompressed bitcoin addresses are unlocked with the same private key. In this instance that is the one in the OP: fdae96f8dd292374a966ec8b57d9cc680ce1d23cb7072c522efe32a1a7e34b0
So now you know how it all happened. The private key in this instance is not private so anyone can spend those bitcoins and somebody did.
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:08:48


It occurs to me that there might be another reason for this. Back when the Mt. Gox debacle took place it came out that they were using a custom version of bitcoind that they had failed to keep up to date with the latest patches. Maybe the reason why all these exchanges outsource part of their operations to bitgo is that they lack the talent to keep up to date with changes in bitcoin core software.

Yes. I don't recommend this at all. 
I suggest running an electrum server instead and creating an offline electrum setup. The online watching only wallet can be setup to use your electrum server only. This way you get the privacy and security benefits of bitcoin core with the ease of use of electrum.

The key was not saved. Old bc.i wallets generated truly random keys for each and every private key. If you created a new address then that would have a totally random private key that was unconnected to previous address private keys. The way the wallet is supposed to work is that the private keys are generated in your browser and then encrypted using your password and the encrypted keys are stored on bc.i's servers i.e. "synced" there. If the sync fails for some reason and you close the browser your keys are lost forever.
Now you have HD wallets with bc.i so the one time backup is good for the life of the wallet and if it fails to sync for some reason you don't lose money.

electrum isn't very fast. it has an old bug where transactions that have confirmed show up as unconfirmed until you restart it. also sometimes the servers, that are all run by volunteers, lag and have stale data about transactions. so the wallet doesn't update like it should.
however electrum is definitely safer than a web wallet. but I can't recommend it to the OP because he wants something that updates very fast.

Yep that's right. An address is not the same as a wallet. Wallets have many addresses.

these are the early stages of a bubble. the hype is not going to die down any time soon. it will last at least 6 months. in that time the value is going to stratospheric and you will regret not having bought earlier. in fact you will probably end up buying when it's much higher than it is today. then when the bubble bursts you will become a bag holder as we call them!
if you want to buy then do it now. don't forget to sell when it hits 2k

typos don't cost you money with addresses because addresses have checksums built in. so you make a mistake entering an address and the wallet tells you the address is invalid and won't send bitcoins to it.

You don't want to do regular buys for the next few months. You want to buy as much as you want to buy NOW. Then you watch the price closely the next few months and when you feel it has peaked you sell. Then you stop yourself from buying again until the price goes down which it will because bitcoin bubbles do burst. The price will take its sweet time going down so you'll have to be patient. It may take 6-12 months.
Later you can do dollar cost averaging and regular buys and shit. But not in the next few months or you'll be stuck with overpriced coins.
This is my take on things. Good luck.

The way to reduce the transaction fee is to build a second layer on top of the blockchain where transactions are nearly free. This is what lighting is all about and we already have an alpha version of it out from blockchain.info. Blockstream is also working on their own lighting network. 


By that time btc will have become a settlement layer for lightning transactions so a single BTC transaction will be worth many hundreds perhaps thousands of lightning ones. So it won't matter if the fees at the settlement layer are higher than they are today.


Bitcoin is designed so that the transaction fees increase over time. We can increase the volume of transactions using a second layer thereby reducing the per transaction cost. But the fees at the BTC layer will only increase to pay for miner's expenses and compensate them for the reduced block subsidy.

It just occurred to me that you can sell your bitcoins for western union or moneygram. This means you should be able to get it done in the nearest city/large town. You will have to connect with a reputable trader on localbitcoins.com. There are many there that do WU so you should have no trouble finding one. Since WU is worldwide the trader doesn't have to be someone in Central Africa. However WU is expensive so it's going to cost you. 
A SWIFT transfer i.e. international bank wire transfer is another option. But that's likely going to be expensive too.

Currencies that depend on trusted sources, notaries, gatekeepers, banks, companies, regulators or any other centralized group are a dime a dozen. Bitcoin is unique precisely because no one party is in charge. If one party was in charge it could be pressured by powerful people to censor transactions as happens all the time with other payment methods. No one can censor bitcoin transactions because it is decentralized.

Mining is done in mining pools where individual miners from around the world contribute to the effort. They all get a slice of those 12.5. The amount a miner gets depends on the formula used by the mining pool to divide the proceeds and the amount of computing power the miner contributed to the effort. So yeah it's definitely not 12.5 btc per miner.
The reason mining is done in pools is because the day and age when you could get a block yourself on any reasonable time scale are long gone. So in order to provide some level of consistent income miners developed mining pools.
Mining is done in datacenters with hundreds of specialized machines we call ASICs. So it's no longer something that is accessible to the ordinary person on the street. Unless, of course, you have hundreds of thousands of dollars to invest in the venture.

That depends on the volatility of bitcoin and the fees taken by middlemen involved in a bitcoin transaction. I think a swift transfer costs about $60 so if we assume bitcoin volatility + middlemen together cost you just 1% then any amount greater than $6000 is cheaper to send via swift.
@_date: 2016-09-20 13:28:39

If you mention bitcoin to your bank they are going to fuck you up. So first of all don't do that. Ever. 
Your bank won't help you. Almost all banks are against bitcoin and bitcoin is totally unregulated so first learn what you are getting into.
Second take it slow. No exchange is going to sell that much to a new customer. You need to sign up to an exchange, submit various ID docs to verify yourself on there, and then slowly buy bitcoins. This way you build a relationship with them. If you buy a lot at once then that will set of alarm bells. They are very concerned about payments fraud because, unlike bitcoin, most other payment methods are reversible.
The other advantage of buying slowly is that you can learn about various bitcoin wallets and how to securely store your bitcoin. As mentioned above bitcoin is totally unregulated so take it slow.

My god man did you even read what he wrote? He says that bitcoin is used by the agents on both sides of the transaction to settle balances between themselves. It isn't used by the customer at all. So the remittance company in SK and the filipino company are the ones using bitcoin. They are obviously not going to do settlement with every transaction. They are going to do it in batches. Say once a day or once a week. So the amounts will be in the thousands of dollars at least.

The OP talks about middlemen involved in the fiat &lt;-&gt; bitcoin process. Those rates will not be low. 
The thing with swift is that it has two advantages here for transferring large amounts:
- fixed fee that does not change with the amount being transferred. So the more you transfer the less you pay percentage wise.
- Excellent exchange rates because banks are involved. 
Anyway the OP has since clarified that they don't transfer large amounts and in fact settle each and every transaction as and when it occurs. So SWIFT does not give them lower fees in this scenario.

I guess the only difference is that with a watermark you have to monitor pirated movies to see where the leak came from. With a hidden key you just need to monitor bitcoin addresses.
In either case you can use steganography to hide the data and the leaker can look for it and delete it before making the movie public. The only way this would work is if you can keep the method of hiding the bitcoin key a secret that you only reveal to bounty hunters and not the leaker. But then if you can do that with a key then you can do that with a digital watermark too.
You are right. I don't see what the major advantage of using bitcoin is.

On that infamous wall observer thread in the forum somebody posted some "rules" for trading if you will.

Interesting stuff but of course that's for speculators not long term investors.
@_date: 2016-05-25 16:04:03
Nothing. It's a free market and if someone wants to try and buy all the bitcoins he can do that. They would likely do it via multiple front agents/front companies so as to not give away their intentions and drive up the price too much early on. But the price will eventually rise because of the demand they generate and they will have to pay a hefty premium to buy all the bitcoins. 
When they've mopped them all up the only ones left will be the newly mined ones, the ones yet to be mined and the ones where the private key is lost or forgotten. They can buy any mined bitcoins but they won't be able to get the ones with the lost private keys. I also think there will be a few fanatic hodlers who won't sell at even $1 million/btc.

No but there are many people who are able to move your money for you.

Somebody posted here that bitcoin is only used where it provides the greatest utility. Some legitimate use cases are cross border payments and micro payments. This is how it is getting traction. 
The other thing that's increasing its popularity is merchant adoption. Merchants love it because there is no risk of chargeback so they are offering discounts and other incentives. That is definitely having an effect on adoption by consumers. 
Mainstream adoption is very far away and may only happen once we've gotten additional layers are built on top of the blockchain that allow real time transactions, transactions denominated in fiat currencies and so on.

No you should buy a lump sum amount at the right time. Studies have show dollar averaging doesn't work. Buying a large sum when the price is low is the best way to do it.

1. Ether is a platform for distributed applications. The currency is only supposed to pay for computing resources on the ether network although speculators are pushing up the price of that anyway. IBM and some other companies favour ether over btc. They think it is btc 2.0 so to speak. Generally speaking asking about altcoins on this forum is a bad idea. We are all bitcoin zealots so we don't like altcoins.
2. Those are exchanges and it's all up in the air as far as their security is concerned. I think circle guarantees a fair amount. You can have a wallet on your desktop or mobile so thinking an exchange is the same as a wallet is a big misunderstanding on your part.
3. I would just go with a single multisig wallet where you need two devices to spend the bitcoins. A PC and mobile for example. You can do this easily with copay and less easily with electrum. This way you get security and spendability as well.
4. He put up a whitepaper which you can find on bitcoin.org. If you hang around long enough you learn most of the things in that whitepaper from other sources so it's not so special anymore.
5. What do you mean? Donkeys vs. Elephants :) ?
6. There is the guy who made a paper wallet of Dorian Nakamoto and got a $100 tip right here on reddit. I thought that was cool! (Paper wallets are not cool though. Don't go using a paper wallet.)

The truth is early adopters do sell when the price hits new highs. They sold at $1000 which is why the price crashed. They will sell again while telling everyone else to hold. There are even people who specialize in helping bitcoiners cash out legally.

first of all answer the following questions:

- Is the private key a string of random characters that starts with either a 5,L, or K? Or is it a set of English words?
Easiest thing would be to just use multibit to restore your wallet and then create a new electrum wallet and send from multibit to an address in your electrum wallet.

An address is not the same as a wallet. Wallets have many addresses and you shouldn't fixate on individual addresses. The only thing you need concern yourself is which wallet the address belongs to. Addresses that belong to your wallet are where you receive bitcoin. Addresses belonging to other people's wallets are where you send bitcoin.

He's including the satoshi coins in the lost category. Those millions of coins could someday be spent by satoshi. He may simply be holding them for the future.
I'm OK with other lost coins being included because once a private key is gone it's gone. No getting it back. You can't salvage it from the bottom of the atlantic.

Yep but look at it like this. Before bitcoin he would have had to shutdown completely. Now he gets to survive. Paypal blocked him and BTC saves his company. We are going to see this over and over again. 
In my country banking transactions are irreversible but now there is pressure from the central bank to change that in the name of ["fraud prevention"]( Soon it'll be like the banking system in the west where transactions can be reversed even months later. The burden then falls on merchants who have to police their customers asking for ID and shit from each and every customer. Bitcoin solves all that by being irreversible and decentralized.

You shouldn't use greenaddress as long term storage because greenaddress requires you to move your bitcoins at least once every 3 months or the wallet backups (nlocktime transactions) don't work correctly. So I wouldn't recommend it for this purpose. 
It's difficult to recommend a wallet for long term storage because the network is constantly evolving. The best you can do is go with a large and popular project that will likely continue to be around in the long term. So any of the popular HD wallets like core (&gt;=13.0), multibit hd, electrum or copay.

You can add the following to your list of uses for bitcoin:
- Use as a payment method by people living in third world countries. As in a general payment method for online purchases. Our CCs often don't work online because we are considered a payments fraud risk.
- Remittances to and from third world countries. This includes payments sent for work done by third worlders. A lot of first world payment systems like paypal do not support 3rd world countries at all. Bitcoin makes small value transfers possible.
As for your question "is it enough?" The answer is that right now this is what bitcoin is most useful for so that's what it is being used for. 
However, development work is continuing and it will soon become a viable currency for other things as well. I suggest looking into the lightning network and the advantages it offers over how we do things currently. Faster and cheaper transactions for example.
Better and easier to use wallets will also lower the barrier to entry for lay people. 
So it's an evolving situation because bitcoin is an open system and people are building on it and making it better all the time. The user experience 5-7 years from now will be very different. It'll be much easier for the ordinary user.

There is a one to one relationship between public keys and private keys. An address is the public key run through hashing functions and with a checksum added to it to detect typos. So there is a one to one relationship between a private key and an address too. 
HD wallet seeds are different from private keys. They can be used to generate many different private keys one for each address in your wallet. Hash functions are used to generate the address specific private keys from the wallet seed. The output of hash functions is as good as random so it is possible to do this.
How is it possible to restore a wallet from the 12 word mnemonic? The mnemonic is the wallet seed in a human friendly format. So you have the seed and with it you can generate the address specific private keys, their corresponding public keys and bitcoin addresses. Once you have the bitcoin addresses you can query the blockchain for transactions related to those addresses.

The stuff about aliens is a load of crap. The stuff about bitcoin is interesting. Not entirely accurate but interesting nevertheless. 
It's not accurate because the average time between blocks since the first block is less than 10 minutes. Hashing power has kept ahead of difficulty changes throughout. The second reason is that difficulty only changes once every 2 weeks so between one change and the next you could have blocks being mined much faster or slower than once every ten minutes.

My God man what do you think all the other digital payment systems are? Paypal, SWIFT, ACH, CHIPS, SEPA etc. are all centralized digital payment systems that have been around for ages. It's the decentralization that makes bitcoin unique. It's not just another centralized system where transactions can be censored.
And if you think there is no blockchain based centralized system then you are wrong there too. Ripple is one that has been around for ages and it's nowhere as popular as bitcoin even with tie ups with banks.


This I can agree with. The reason is that there is an eb and flow to it. There are times when there is a lot of hype. And then there are times when things are more relaxed.
