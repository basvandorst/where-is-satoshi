Correct. They'd stop -&gt; value would go up -&gt; it'd be worth it again to mine-&gt; then repeat

Check out the 5770s they use HALF the amount of power that the 5830s suck up and mine are OCd and getting ~220Mhs.
Both set ups will have close to the same energy consumption.
2 - 5770s = $220 - 440Mhs (new egg still in stock) 
1 - 5830 = $160 - 300Mhs

What I'll get voted down for and what no one has mentioned and what happens in everyone of these posts is this.
What people don't understand is that when it becomes NOT profitable to mine, mining will stop! Pretty sure all pools are stilllllllll mining hard. The OTHER thing no one seems to ever mention is that the price of BTC could rise much higher, yeah I have a nice electric bill but if BTC goes a lot higher it'll be worth all the time mining. LASTLY, not everyone pays for electric in their apt/whatever and prices for electric vary worldwide... so conversion rates, or electric to BTC, are impossible for anyone to tell you if it's 'right' or 'not', look at your electric bill and you'll have a better idea of if it's 'worth it' for you. 
No one knows what'll happen, defiantly not me, that's part of the 'game'

Has anyone heard of Ruxum? They're "supped" to be using the same high-level security that most stock trading platforms use. My friend recently invited me and told me about them, personally I don't know much about it, just signed up.
PM me if anyone wants an invite.

Yeah, I'd like to know the answer to that question too.
And sorry for your loss :/

Yup 5770s use half the power idk why ppl are so into this card. 2-5770s have a better hash rate and use up the same amount of power. People never keep power in mind only hash rate and that's just not wise.

Good luck keeping those warm in that case

You are right. It's like if it is too expensive to mine for gold people wouldn't just stop mining for it anymore. There will always be a profit from mining even if that's pennies.

If I had to guess, with one 5770 OC'd @ ~220 Mhash I'd guess you'd get around 1 BTC every 8 days if running 24/7 Also, i might add that the 5770s power consumption to Mhash ratio is quite nice.
