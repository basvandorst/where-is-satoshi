It isn't the Euro that is failing so why do Greeks see the need to convert their money to Bitcoin? Is it just fear or general ignorance?

...2 weeks is 2 weeks. 14 days. It is a set period of time irrelevant to a calendar.  We are not concerned with what month or year it is.

Oops. I'm a software engineer. So yes, I use dates constantly. 14 days is a timespan, not a date. :(

It's not outlawed.  I can accept precious metals for goods and services without any problem. Both fiat and precious metals are used as value in trade.. so there's no reason bitcoin and fiat can't also do the same.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:13:39
I think they most definitely will co-exist.. mainly because of FDIC insurance that a consumer would get with a bank.  I think it will sort of be like how gold currently co-exists with fiat.

@_date: 2014-01-14 19:07:20
Yeah I saw that too.  But what transaction? A bitcoin transaction to a particular address? Or by transaction do they just mean communicated via the net?

This guy is a moron.
@_date: 2014-03-08 13:22:03
The reason I think it's not him is because if it IS him, then he was using his real name the entire time.  Why would anyone who wanted to remain anonymous do this? Doesn't add up at all and it was a red flag as soon as I read the article.  Also, he agreed to go out to lunch with a reporter? 
@_date: 2014-01-07 18:08:14
This is honestly a really good idea.  The machines are already connected to the internet.  They just need to keep a globally funded address and pull from it and use a price quote from bitstamp or something.  They'd make some serious money too.
@_date: 2014-01-05 14:48:42
I'd like to nominate this question as the most common question posted to this sub. Does anyone have examples of any others?
@_date: 2014-03-08 03:18:31
The fear exists that people CAN be audited though which keeps them honest.   With bitcoin, they realize they can't be.  Kind of the reason many people choose not to report cash transactions.

I don't think anyone should be forced to spend.  The market will do what the market will do.  If society sees the benefit of using bitcoins and spending them, then it shouldn't matter what you personally decide to do.  If everyone hoards and bitcoin collapses because of it, then do you blame the hoarders or bitcoin itself?

12 words from 1626 words = 1626^12 = 3.4x10^38 = ~2^128 possible seeds.  Cracking a 128 bit key is not feasible with today's technology.
@_date: 2014-03-10 13:01:15
I think it might be in Coinbase's interest to work out something similar to Bitpay for charities.  Maybe make a little bit of money on the exchange rate and not charge any fees whatsoever.

You missed the point. I chose copper piping specifically because it had value, but probably not what you'd want instead of the equivalent cash/silver/bitcoin whatever.
@_date: 2014-01-07 02:39:38
The real reason is because there will be less coins being offered on the markets if everyone hoards (or if coins are lost). If you flooded the market with your coins, the price would go back down.

Exactly.  Ebay has the power to do whatever as long as its not defrauding people out of money or doing anything illegal.  Ebay can break any relationship it wants with whomever it wants for any reason it wants.  If eBay doesn't want you selling something, tough luck; Find another outlet.

Who would store over 10k in a bank account anyway? 
@_date: 2014-03-19 13:45:46
I would weigh the ups and downs to an investment.  Lets say there was a 75% chance that Bitcoin would be worth 10k a piece.  I would invest a large amount of money into Bitcoin if I knew this.. but would I invest it all?  No. I would to invest an amount that wouldn't destroy me financially if Bitcoin did in fact go to 0.   I've seen some people say they are "all in" and it just looks ridiculous to me.

I think everyone's initial reaction to Bitcoin is "This is fucking stupid.".  Some people never research it and just hold that opinion forever.  Others have that opinion and then it changes even by just going to the Wikipedia page.
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:56:42
If Bitcoin was considered useless enough, then yes.. it is possible someone would want to sell at $20. I think a major security exploit (if one were ever found) could cause a crash to this level. 
@_date: 2014-01-10 19:47:49
So let's say hypothetically all of your income is now Bitcoin.  If you want to pay your rent, or buy groceries, or do practically anything, you have to convert to fiat.. right? How would this be beneficial to the employee?
Edit:  I am pro-Bitcoin, just don't see how this is beneficial to the individual right now.
@_date: 2014-03-15 02:14:50

@_date: 2014-03-10 00:34:45
I don't think you are understanding his question.  He isn't attempting to make his wallet cryptographically sound.  He basically wanted a different way to store a paper wallet (which isn't encrypted).  That's it. Nothing to do with encryption.

I think it would be a huge liability to have that kind of money in bitcoin.  People say "make a paper wallet".. but even still there is that chance that your house is broken into, etc.  Having a sum of bitcoin that large is like hiding 25 gold bars under your bed.

The jewelry industry diamonds are high grade though and that's where the price gauging happens.  You can buy low-grade, translucent, colored diamonds for relatively cheap.   I think his argument would be better made with gold though.  Diamond values are subjective.

I think the point is that drill bits and high end electronics are not the driving forces in the diamond market.

It's also difficult to prove how strong the encryption used is.  Is it a 128 bit key or a 12 bit key? No way to tell just from the ciphertext itself.   Seems almost impossible to enforce.
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:15:46
As a web application developer, I agree.. Most engineers shouldn't try to reinvent the wheel if someone already has created a somewhat pretty, well-designed, intuitive template that follows typical web standards.

Probably means using your own software or something rather than a typical wallet.

"Glenn Seaborg, who shared the 1951 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work with heavy elements and who died in 1999, was the senior author on the resulting study. “It would cost more than one quadrillion dollars per ounce to produce gold by this experiment," Seaborg told the Associated Press that year."

I never store bitcoins on any external websites.  It is a huge risk.  Hell, you can even say owning bitcoin at all there is SOME risk.  Just as there is a risk carrying around $20k in your pocket.  
You have to think of bitcoin exactly like physical cash or gold.  If your gold is not insured, you are in trouble.  Does it mean never carry gold or cash? No.  But it is something that can be stolen without a trace.. Does it make gold or cash inherently "bad".  No..  They have their advantages and disadvantages just like anything else.

Honestly you are right and Jeff makes it seem like more of an issue than it really is.  Even one of the points on the link he posted talks about quantum computing and "undiscovered" flaws in public key cryptography.  If any of these issues actually occurred, not only Bitcoin, but the entire financial system would be in serious trouble.  It discusses security from a purely theoretical standpoint.
@_date: 2015-10-27 14:19:40
There's no security issue in having one bitcoin address.  Some people say there is a security issue after spending from one address multiple times because a "spend" will publish the address' public key.. However, the work involved to try to find a private key from a public key is incredibly difficult. 
It's like the difference between trying to find a needle in 10,000,000 tons of hay vs 20,000,000 tons of hay.

It doesn't need to be a currency.  It can be a store of value that is transferred over the internet.  I think of it as "digital gold".  It can certainly still be used for purchases just as gold can be used for purchases if accepted.

That was a hell of a read.  Now there's no way to know for sure the owner is cheating or if the user just had a streak of terrible luck, but the owner threatening to steal the guy's BTC is enough to steer me away from this site.

Gold isn't worth something because it is shiny.  There are plenty of other shiny things that are worth a fraction of the price of gold.  The industrial value of gold was only recently discovered as well (when compared to the length of time gold was used as currency).
The real reason gold has value is because of its rarity, ability to be identified easily, and chemical stability.

Of course it is for speculators right now. This is the earliest stages of bitcoin.  The people buying it right now will the be the ones who are rich when if it finally gets big (maybe even 5-10 years from now).. There aren't even many places to spend bitcoins right now so all you can really do is buy drugs or invest.  Whether it is a bubble or not, I imagine most bitcoin investors are in it long term so even if it drops back to $20/per, they won't sell.
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:08:22

You two are very silly. very very silly indeed.  I state that the value of an item is the price upon which the buyer and seller agree to make a sale.

Last I heard gold couldn't be used to pay off debt either (except in some states, I believe).  Does this make it any less valuable or useful? No.  It has been a store of value for thousands of years before it even had an industrial purpose.   I'd love to hear what this guy thinks about gold's value.

I'm still waiting for the algorithm to be published that can generate the entire keyspace of "all possible english sentences" under a certain length of words.  It hasn't been done and the amount of labor and pure brain power to generate such a list (of say 12 word sentences) would be incredible.  Even if it WERE possible to generate such a list, the keyspace would be insanely large and brute forcing it would likely take an eternity.

If I installed Electrum on my mother's computer, she wouldn't need to know anything besides what her receive addresses were, how many bitcoins she had, and how to send bitcoins to another address.   Electrum is password encrypted by default anyway so even if someone were to access her files, they wouldn't gain anything of value.  
How exactly would failure to understand public and private keys lead to theft?  The only way I could see this happening is if someone asked her for her private key and address and she just handed it out.

Appreciate it.  So I understand digital signatures, but probably not in the context that bitcoin is using them.  If I digitally sign something with my private key (from what I know about digital signatures), the signature can be verified using my public key that should be well known.  This is the usual form.
In bitcoin's case, the public key is not well known you say until a transaction occurs.. How is my public key computed from my digital signature?

Because that is the price people are willing to pay for them.   This is basic economics.  The price is set based on supply and demand.
If you are asking why they have any value at all, it is due to their reasonable scarcity, difficulty to counterfeit, easily transferable, decentralized, easily dividable and the list goes on.  
When someone says "but they are just digital coins LOL!. they arent even anything. they are made up!!!" the reply is "The dollar is a piece of paper that the government says is valuable."
If you want to know if I believe the price can go to zero, I will say yes I believe it can.  Just matters if the public loses trust in it or not.
@_date: 2013-03-31 02:50:57
There is actually a limited number of bitcoins available.  It is set at around 20 million bitcoins EVER.  There can never be inflation.. but more likely there will be deflation due to "lost" bitcoins that people forget about or lose their private keys (passwords) to.

I sometimes doubt how many courses in cryptography these authors have taken.  I could understand the possibility of a dictionary attack on a one-word password, but if I were to tell you my password consisted of three English words one after another with no numbers or capitals, you'd have to try ~171,000^3 passwords.   Based on this, there is no real reason why anyone would need a password that looked like "Zr234sfsejawf", as it is possible to create an easy to remember password that is resistant to common cracking methods.

No one here understands your question.  What is the fundamental value of gold?

Can you clarify the math for me?  I understand that (3.402823669×10³⁸ / 10,000 / 1x10^9) is the total amount of time necessary to search the entire keyspace.  How did you figure out the time needed to just find 1 of them?

Here are a few reasons why tulips and Bitcoin are not related:
1. Tulips wither and die.  Because of this, they can never be a great store of value.
2. Tulips can be grown by ANYONE which could cause massive inflation on the tulip market.  Bitcoins inflation is controlled and has a finite limit.
3. Tulip value is not the same across all tulips. Would someone value a blue tulip over a red one?  Maybe another person would value the red tulip more. What if one was missing a leaf? All bitcoins are the same.

This assumes two things:
1.  The guy who bought the bitcoins is dumb enough to transfer BTC to a known public bitcoin address rather than a dynamically generated one.  Otherwise, there would be no way to tie the receiving address to 7-11.
2.  Even if they did catch the guy who bought the Bitcoins, what makes you think he would even know anything about the kidnapper? or even remember?  This could possibly recover funds, but wouldn't catch the kidnapper.
A real life scenario would most likely contain transactions through several hundred addresses before being spent anywhere public though if done intelligently.

The private key "unlocks" your address and allows you to spend btc from it.  You can't spend bitcoins or transfer them from an address unless you have the private key.  As you can probably tell, if you were to find out ANY address' private key, it would be possible to steal those funds.  If you are using coinbase, coinbase basically says "we'll keep track of your private keys for you.. just worry about your account balance".  
Many other wallets also keep track of the private keys for you although you can see the private keys if you really want to..

I think this is probably true...  the weird thing is that it seems people in banking jobs are more likely to not understand what real money is in general.  A lot of them are anti precious metals too. It is probably because in their world, everything revolves around fiat. 
@_date: 2013-07-10 02:21:12
1.  It is impossible to calculate the future value of bitcoin.  All you can do is guess.  I wouldn't trust any "calculator".
2.  Gold cannot be divided into small measurable pieces easily, so at today's value it is not really efficient to use as currency I.E. try to buy a loaf of bread with gold.  Bitcoin can be divided.. so even if its value increases a ton, it can still be used.

A store of value needs to be universally trusted to have value which is based on the properties described above by tbeau1.  The exchange mechanism adds to its value, but is not the sole purpose.  If it is the sole purpose, anything that could be exchanged digitally would be considered an acceptable currency.  But yes, the more people that use the currency, the more it will gain value.

The supply of gold is known as well, but price still fluctuates based on demand. The value of any currency is 100 percent dependent on what someone is willing to pay at any given time.  There is no way to tell the value of something "without speculation". I.E. what is the value of gold without speculation?
@_date: 2013-09-16 03:38:53
It's nice that the PM's also have industrial value, but the point I was trying to make is that gold and silver would have value even if they had absolutely NO industrial value.  So something (like Bitcoin) can have value without intrinsic value... hell would you pick up a $100 bill?  Why does it have value? Because people believe it does.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:54:06

How do you know it is overbought?  With a stock, you have P/E as an indicator as to how inflated a stock's price is.  With bitcoin, there is nothing.  If the price of gold were to go up, would you say it is exaggerated expectations?  It is a commodity and should be treated as such.

Gold isn't valuable because it is shiny.  It is valuable because has certain properties (finite, rare, non corrodable) that make it a great store of value.  The celebrity factor has nothing to do with it.  Gold has had value for thousands of years before "celebrities" flaunted it.

Gold was traded and valued before it had ANY intrinsic value.  Its electrical properties are somewhat newly discovered considering the several thousand year history of gold.  Bitcoin has similar properties to that of gold.
Gold's value stems from the fact that is rare, doesn't corrode/break down, it is easily identified,  and not easily counterfeited.

Honestly, after reading this, it doesn't really seem to be at all like Litecoin. It just builds on Litecoin and adds some undesirable features such as slower confirmation times and less coins.   Litecoin is also much cheaper which equates to more liquidity and a far superior product.

To me, speculating is high risk. Investing is more low risk. Seems that is the definition I see across the internet as well.  Putting money in a mutual fund is investing.  Buying shares of of some brand new penny stock would be speculating.   I guess you can somehow equate this to "hope" vs "expectation".. but that isn't really a science while risk actually could be broken down technically based on underlying factors of a company or asset.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:59:15

Here is your education:
1.  Silver has the highest conductivity out of ALL metals and for this reason has many industrial applications.  One of which is solar paneling.  Google for more uses.
2.  Silver is considered a precious metal.  It is rare and impossible to "create" artificially.  It has been a store of value for the same length of time as gold (thousands of years). Nothing new.
3. Even without industrial use, something can still have value (i.e. the united states dollar, bitcoin, gold).  Gold and silver were both traded before humans understood their industrial value.  As long as people believe there is value, it exists.

I was always under the impression that the miners could choose the minimum fee that he or she is willing to accept.

@_date: 2013-03-29 02:16:32
I wouldn't really relate this to buying stock and setting a "price point" as many bitcoin users see this as a possible future currency and aren't looking to sell possibly ever.
 This is a brand new concept...  of course there is some risk if it doesn't take hold, or there is a security flaw in the algorithm, but the reward could be huge compared to its current price.

I think the wording "Absolutely not" is what causes this post to lose credibility.  To assume it is remotely close to elementary to crack a made-up 12 word sentence is just flat out wrong.

The weusecoins.com video was basically my introduction to Bitcoin.  At the time, I really felt like it lacked technical detail.

I feel like they should have at least mentioned the cryptography or digital signature aspects as they did in the PBS video... even the allusion to gold and a top limit of 21 million bitcoins would have helped.

You are correct.  This is assuming the attacker somehow knows I have 3 english words as my password.  If the attacker does not know this (and why would he/she?) then my password is just another 15 or so character password which would be nearly impossible to brute force.

I agree with this (especially the part about "efficency" or well made products). This is exactly why I can't stand the people that say "Spend your bitcoins! It helps bitcoin!"

They actually manipulate the prices in the opposite direction.

Well technically any computer that is connected to the internet has some chance of being infected by a trojan... but if that happened, your online banking credentials could be stolen or ss# keylogged etc.  The risk is pretty small.  Can't be too paranoid about it.
If you were really worried, you could just keep a computer (with a fresh install of an OS) off the internet at all times and decrypt it using that.  Overkill as far as i'm concerned.
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:46:43

And trust me.. businesses would much rather deal with cash to avoid tax as well.  It can also be exchanged between friends though or contacts in other countries instantly.
4. You need to ask yourself why "gold is engrained in our psychology".  Bitcoin is a new type of gold.  A digital form of gold and can have value for the same reason gold does.

Here's a tip:  Quit begging on Reddit.

He was probably trying to diversify it into other assets... but USD into a bank account is not the way to go especially if you don't want to be caught.  I'm sure he still has thousands of bitcoins spread out among different addresses.

Lack of fees, lack of taxes. Mostly the same reasons why companies would rather take cash than credit.  Bitcoin's value is also on an upward trend, so maybe they don't think of it as volatile in a bad way.

What a terrible idea.
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:13:55
Because it is more like gold than it is fiat.

Are you being serious about the kiddie porn thing as a reason not to use bitcoin? I can't tell.

As long as he gives back the $2400 when the time comes, otherwise he is gambling with someone else's money.

This just shows how legitimately scared Paypal is. They better learn to love it cause it ain't going away anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-10-28 13:48:35
If you don't like bank of america, I would switch banks... but putting everything into BTC doesn't seem like the smartest of ideas right now.
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:07:04
How do you accept fiat currency in a P2P based way?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:24:20
I truly value your opinion.

People who bought at $250 in april said the same thing.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:48:18
the chart has gone full parabolic. it is so vertical, that it is even going backwards.

I'm pro-Bitcoin and I do not agree. Anything can happen.
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:33:13
What? People manipulate markets? Who would do such a thing?
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:01:57
It is only complicated depending on how detailed your explanation of it needs to be.  For the average person, there isn't even a real need to get into how public keys/private keys work.  I explained it fine to my mother saying that "addresses" are like bank accounts and she can create an almost infinite number of them anonymously.  I also got into the finite number of bitcoins that existed by comparing it to gold. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:57:58
Cool story bro.  Will comment again when it hits $250.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:50:47
I don't believe it is.. Many people look for ways out of their country when their government restricts their freedom/enslaves them.  You are choosing to stay though. Must be pretty content.
@_date: 2013-06-15 21:07:42
It's not a stock.  I.e What's the p/e ratio of gold?  That being said, it is an interesting statistic but not really relevant.. especially after all bitcoins are mined.
@_date: 2013-04-05 08:21:53
So if public key encryption is easily hackable, explain how moving change to a different address helps.

If this guy's system admin skill is at all equal to his knowledge of money, i'd fire him instantly.

This isn't what he's describing.  He's not trying to get his personal comments or posts upvoted. This rule exists to stop spammers and propaganda spreaders from gaining artificial publicity.

It used to be backed by gold, but we have been taken off of the gold standard for decades now. Basically it has value because of trust in our government not to over inflate it...
@_date: 2013-03-29 17:18:10
this isn't correct.  its not a simple fraction.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:04:01
I hear Apple is coming out with a similar feature.. except you have to pay a one time fee of $100 to use it.. and $9.95 per month.
@_date: 2013-03-28 01:22:13
I don't believe it will ever replace the dollar (unless maybe the dollar crashes), but instead it will act as another form of wealth (like gold, silver, platinum, etc).  It will of course be the go-to currency for cheap transfers, money laundering, criminal use, etc...

You could go to your local coin shop and convert a portion to precious metals if you want.

Hmm.. A plumber provides his services for money. Is he not required to pay tax?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:06:34
LOL.  This author is a complete moron.  We've had these "crashes" many times.  It's called volatility.
@_date: 2013-09-02 16:04:06
Until an alternate cryptocurrency is released that can offer something Bitcoin cannot, they are all doomed to fail.  Most are just based on Bitcoin anyway...

$1500 for an hour and a half? Why does that seem not believable.
@_date: 2013-12-13 15:42:32
If this is a pull from my bitcoin balance rather than a push from me to the merchant, I don't trust it.

Hasn't GTA taught you anything?  If you pay in BTC, how are you gonna punch her in the face and take her money?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:37:22
Wouldn't this just cause a panic and even more of a sell-off?

I was just going to mention iron having more industrial value than gold in another reply to him.

I believe bitcoin will go exponential in 2 weeks time. Full exponential. I'm talking full vertical. 10 digit bitcoin.
