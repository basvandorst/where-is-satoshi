one day people won't ask how much bitcoin did you buy and at what price, but how long ago did you buy bitcoin and at what price. For example, to say "I bought $100 of bitcoin ten years ago" would result in the response "Holy Fuck! A Ten Year Bitcoin HODL? Drinks are on you Mr Big!"
I reckon this will be the normal attitude for the next ten to twenty years. Eventually, how long a hodl might decrease in importance as the world market for crypto approaches saturation and then settles into &lt;21 million bitcoins flowing across the world as just day to day ordinary money. When the crypto-revolution has matured into a crypto-status-quo and people don't 'buy' crypto anymore but mostly just earn it or get paid it by a government as part of some kind of citizens wage or whatever.

"everyone in the Buy/Hold room decides its their price to quit", remember, humans are a fractious lot. We never decide as one to do something and we almost never all see things the same way..

Strikes me that the problem is "interest", saying money out of nothing doesn't really mean much in terms of the problem. A lot of people don't get why Bitcoin has value, all money is a social convention. Social convention says bitcoin has value, that justifies building data-centres to generate it and spending energy to process bitcoins transactions and accepting it as payment as well as coverting it to hodl. The social convention develops first, where does the social convention come from? Saying "nothing" simply can't be right, whatever you're using as money. I do agree about interest though, like the feudal lord laying claim to your wife on your wedding night or something- which again was a social convention in feudal society.

Fiat was never "out of nothing", to be honest I think it's perfectly reasonable to create money off the back of a good business plan based around something considered of value, that money created than being destroyed as the bank-loan or whatever is paid off. What we're really talking about with fiat is money based on obligation (debt / credit). Problem is the system is easily captured. All money is in any case a social artifact. I like bitcoin because it's based on a consensus of value where the number of units hold-still so that value can be reached by said consensus.

The problem with that is the society would have to try and stand still, it's economy would niether expand nor shrink- everyone would have only two children (one for each parent) and pass the same house down through the generations.

Probably in line with the growth of society no? Perhaps slightly more to account for Capitalisms holy creed.

We see a plunge, then we see a slight recovery... then we see a plunge. It's like watching someone being punched in the face down a staircase. 
WHAM! Falls down a few steps, couple moments pass, and then he staggers to his feet, shakes head, gingerly touches mouth, straightens tie, adjusts cuffs, raises finger to say something to the assailant and then WHAM! Down he goes agin another few steps. 
Oh bitcoin, I thought you could handle yourself.  Hope we see a "That's it fucker, I tried to be nice" ninja-moment from bitcoin price soon.
