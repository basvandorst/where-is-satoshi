Uhhh shit like bonds are extremely secure and not considered aggressive at all and typically match inflation.  
Shit like S&amp;P500 investing is not an aggressive position, and yields a consistent growth of 6-7% per year historically speaking.

Even poor people have access to the internet in this day and age (outside of literally the homeless and truly bottom 5%, of course). With that, one could learn anything they need to know about investing. Opening an account at Vanguard is free. Isn't like it costs money to start investing -- just takes the money you wish to invest.  
If you have the money to save, you have it to invest. This isn't an issue of rich people keeping down poor people due to some esoteric knowledge. Poor people are kept down because they just don't have the money, not because they don't have the means to invest it if they had it.

Last few years, inflation has been ["dangerously low"] ( for some reason, closer to 1.3%.  
Economists -- no, not goofy Reddit armchair economists, but real economists -- have expressed concern for the damage to the economy and if maybe the government should interfere again like they did in the 80's, but to HELP inflation this time.

I generally agree with your sentiment, but let's be real on something:  


iPhone 1 was not mindblowing. The internet itself was not originally mindblowing. TONS OF THINGS were not originally mindblowing. Yes, there's a lot of junk polluting the consumer environment. But the gems we do have... they exist because somebody had a good idea, put it out there and it was rough, but made some money because people spend money. They used that money to improve and improve until they created a gem.  
What I'm saying is: if iPhone 7 is already a gem, and you're expected as an entrepreneur to BEAT IPHONE 7 BY A HUGE MARGIN in order to enter the market, new entrepreneurs will just be forced out of the market.   
Also, the rich will get richer, and those too poor to put money into an account in the first place will be too poor.  
People who currently create companies trying to earn 10% more per year will say fuck that because they can just leave their money in the bank to have it deflate and become worth 20% more per year. No risk required. That means less jobs for everybody.  
Also, gonna need to lay you off. You're too expensive. The money we pay you is worth more.  
And raise? Who do you think you are? 5% more per year? Nah. You now make 3% LESS per year! But that's okay, because deflation means you are still EFFECTIVELY making 1% more per year :)  
Or if you're too expensive, maybe just lay you off yeah.

Just to be clear, 401k's and non-roth IRA's are the same things.  
I'm sure you're going to respond and act like you knew this and were specifically referring to roth IRA's and crap, but I really doubt you did based on your language, and I'm not saying this to make fun of you. None of us were born knowing what a roth IRA was or anything. But you should definitely look into roth IRA's because they are actually quite a good vehicle for retirement investing. IMO, far better than 401k's/traditional IRA's.

True, but there are unintended consequences as well. If people spend more frivolously, then they stop eating at McDonalds. McD's goes out of business. Now there are 300k people without jobs. Your taxes go up to pay for them.
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:16:35


K they're basically the same I'm glad you agree.  


Yep they're the same thing. Nice google.  


I understand you're getting ego-checked pretty hard here, but keep your passive-aggressive pants on. I was being genuine when I was informing you to do some research.  


Why on earth are you contributing to an IRA and a Roth IRA? This is really another sign you have no idea what you're doing, considering they both share the same yearly limitation -- and it's pretty low ($5.5k). And if you were making enough money to merit storing money into "5" different vehicles (lol wtf roth 401k and 401k too?) AND crypto AND stocks, you'd have to roth backdoor to even use a roth IRA.  


Roth IRA is pretty strictly better if you actually invest a lot over  even 20 years, which is why the cap is so much lower than 401k. I'm really not sure why you would even say this unless you just googled someone who said something so generic. If you already have a work policy that you're investing into a 401k - especially with matching - you should absolutely not even be considering any money into a traditional IRA.  
I hope you learned something from your google session, though. You're welcome. Done engaging you, since you're awfully pedantic.

It's more like asking how the government knows when you post a threat on a messageboard when you're going through a vpn and bouncing off some proxies and SSRF'ing through some vulnerable website to call some bare metal host you paid for anonymously with BTC that resides in Jamaica to actually execute the act of posting the threat on your behalf. How does the government know it was you? Answer: they don't.  
What's stopping you from using international exchanges, executing transfers directly to anonymous wallets, making coin-to-coin trades using a false identity on international exchanges, etc?  
Obviously that would be tax evasion now, but what I am saying is that THEIR burden seems unfairly high. It seems like an attacker's game to lose. If someone decides to cheat the system, the Gov seems to have very little ability to fight back.

Where is this notion coming from? My mom is an average middle-class citizen and owns a big ass $800 television, two computers, etc. She rents her home, still, around 50, but owns a lot of furniture and other crap. Goes on vacation every other year or so to shit like Disneyland. Owns two computers. Gambles with some of her money.  
There's absolutely zero reason she could not have put money into investments in the last 30 years except for -- you guessed it -- buying shit like big ass televisions.

Either you consulted with your girlfriend when you paid, and she gave you permission or agreed it was a good idea, in which case you have nothing to be ashamed of because you're a team.  
Or she wasn't part of the decision because it isn't her money or her business, in which case you have nothing to be ashamed of because it's your life.  
Or she wasn't part of the decision because you hid it from her, in which case you're a lying scumbag who should be ashamed, regardless of whether bitcoins crashed to $0 or skyrocketed into the millions.  
So either you're a scumbag either way or you're not. Both scenarios: don't worry about the price. Hold for a year or two and enjoy the gains.

Emergency is in the name. Do you do everything the same way you'd do something if it were an emergency? I can not show up to work in an emergency. I gotta show up to work otherwise. I can piss on my boss's head if it's an emergency (eg, his head is on fire). I can't piss on his head when it isn't an emergency.  
The very name implies that you do different shit when it's happening. You save money for an emergency. You save 6 months worth of living expenses for an emergency. You sure as fuck don't save 10 years worth of living expenses for an emergency. You DO save about 30 years worth of living expenses for when you're too old to work -- oh yeah, that's called retirement, and people DO invest for their retirement, which DOES spend the money.  
Also, you shouldn't just have a bunch of money in savings. If you've got $3k-10k (depending on your month-to-month expenses) in savings, good. If you're sitting on $50k in savings, take it the fuck out and put it into the S&amp;P500 already.

I think you exaggerate the reason (a 1 year old phone is still cutting edge). I mean, I bought a GTX 1080 for my computer last August (not even super new tech, then, either) for $650 (current MSRP: ~$600). Now, it's still basically the best GPU outside of the GTX 1080 TI, which isn't even a full generation better. It's been 1.5 years. My buddy still salivates over my GTX 1080. My machine would still be considered high-end. It'll still be considered a good rig for another 3 years I'll wager, and even then it won't turn crap: it'll just be a "normal" gaming PC. It'll probably stay a functional, valuable gaming PC until like 2022-2024 (in that range). The hardware itself might fail before then. And the card itself likely will not drop below $300 even next year, depending on when next generation shit comes out.  
I generally agree with your sentiment. That price goes down AND value goes down, so people buy early for better price AND better value, but people might use the same logic with btc. Why spend btc now instead of later when the price will go up? Because later there's less value in the item.  
Also, this is largely a theoretical issue. The reality is that if people just held btc and didn't spend it, its value could start DROPPING eventually. "Nobody is spending it but people ARE spending fiat, so fuck btc!" The two would reach an equilibrium.

I mostly agree, but...  
You put gold and silver on the same level as CLEAN WATER? And you put INFORMATION above water?  
Sorry, but maybe you forgot that you die in like, seriously, 2 fucking days without water. If you have no water, you suck dicks to survive. No joke. You'd literally suck a dude's dick on the hope that there'll be enough water inside that it'll provide some hydration.  
Shelter, numbers, and water are all king
Food, medicine, and weaponry would be a close second. Along with humans that provide specialized labor. Yes, having 10,000 grunts willing to die for you is more valuable than 1 specialized doctor, but a doctor is really good too.  
Third would be advanced weaponry, gold, and various consumer commodoties (vehicles, chairs, and shit like that). I'd put information down here, unless the information was about shelter/numbers/water.  
Then you've got government bonds and crap like that, which definitely still matter more than stocks.  
Then stocks  
Then crypto coins and garbage like that down there.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:09:02
I'm very libertarian, and I also believe in deflationary currencies, but you're being willfully asinine if you don't see the point they're making.  
Banks giving you 0.05% interest rates while they take your money to charge 3-4% mortgage rates is their entire plan to make moneey. Yes. Banks are businesses, and like all businesses they want to make money. They also need to pay employees and shit.  
Are they super corrupt? Hell yeah.  
But if they started giving you a 3% interest rate per year, they'd just be handing out mortgages with 7% interest rates to offset how much more money they're spending. And even that might not be enough, because the people capable of storing the most money in the bank (top 0.1%) are NOT the same people taking out massive loans (the other 99% that have huge 500k home mortgages).  
That said, if they started paying out 3% interest rates and the superwealthy just sat their money in the bank to reap the 3% interest rate, the bottom 99% would be dealing with shit like 15% interest rates to cover the costs. It's totally unsustainable.  
Also, you are not LENDING the bank your money. They are HOLDING IT for you. There's a huge difference.  
If I lend you money, we agree on a timetable ahead of time about when you pay me back. I cannot legally compel you to give me my money back faster, because - while you owe me money - you do not owe me money at a faster rate than agreed upon.  
When you deposit money in the back, on the other hand, you can withdraw it at any time. They might make huge investments with your money, only to find out tomorrow that you wish to withdraw it all.  
Thankfully, banks skirt this issue by relying on credit and basically just making up fake money from thin air. Unfortunately, this ability to do so leads to bullshit like, you know, "too big to fail bailouts" and shit. It's a shitshow, and I'm not defending it, just saying why some of it exists and need to exist.  
TL;DR: Whether inflationary currency is a good thing or not is irrelevant. The fact is, we've got one in fiat. And while we use fiat, the banks are businesses trying to make money, and in all fairness they cannot give inflationary interest rates and still make money without having hugely unintended consequences. Not considering these unintended consequences is as foolish as the other-batch of people who think that raising the minimum wage to $20 an hour won't have similar unintended consequences. "More money is good for us!" isn't always true; companies will just shaft you another way, or they'll just go out of business if they can't afford to stay in the game. And while I want to move away from fiat same as anybody, we do need fiat to some degree and fiat banks. I believe cryptocurrency will co-exist with fiat -- anyone who truly believes fiat will die someday are delusional. Governments won't let it happen, just because of their loss of power.

No, but people will probably stop eating at McDonalds because a PB&amp;J is way cheaper.  
"GOOD! Good for their health, too!"  
K, now all the McDonalds people are out of jobs. And BK people. And taco bell people. And KFC people. And...  
And people will stop buying "As Seen on TV" crap...  
"GOOD! That's all junky scams anyway!"  
K. Now they're all out of jobs.  
And I don't REALLY need a new couch. A used one works fine. Or just the cheapest piece of shit possible -- I don't need something quality that'll last me 15 years. A piece of shit that'll last me 6 months is fine, because in 6 months my money will be worth more :)  
Buncha more jobs lost.  
I have a good idea for a company! Let's make stuff to sell!!  
Nope:  
1. People won't buy it, because they're saving.  
2. It won't get much early adoption, so even if you literally just invented sliced bread it won't have enough grassroots early adopters spreading the word.  
3. Good luck fucking paying anybody to help your business.  
4. Maybe your business won't make all that much more money than just, you know, putting it in the bank and riding out deflation. Less risk that way :)  
So you don't start your business. Welp, minus more jobs.  
Who is paying for these unemployed people?  
Heh heh heh. Tax payers. Yep. Your money is worth 10% more, so taxes are 10% higher to pay for the 40% of the people who don't have a job.  
Will all of this happen? Nope. Will some of it happen? Yep.  
The fantasy that "IT'LL ALL WORK OUT IN THE END" is hogwash. The rich will get superrich. The poor will get laid off/replaced with machines.  
I think btc works best as a helpful side-kick to an inflationary currency. It can be deflationary while fiat is inflationary. The two will have an inverse relationship depending on the strength of the economy. Like digital gold, its value compared to USD will increase in terms of crisis or decrease in times of boom. Some years, your USD's value will decrease by 1-2% (inflation this year was 1.3%), but putting it in the S&amp;P500 will increase its worth by 7%. Whereas if bitcoin were deflationary at that 1.2% rate (AND you couldn't just invest it into a stock market), then USD would actually be more profitable.  
In a crisis year, when USD is crashing, that's another matter.
