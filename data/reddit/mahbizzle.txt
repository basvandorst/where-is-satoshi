No, that is one theory, but unlikely. More likely they were lost slowly over time due to incompetence or were seized by a government.
Yes theft can happen due to human error. Is there something immune to this?
Oh, perhaps insured dollars? The Fed can just print more to replace your loss? Anything that can be be made and replaced on a whim(no resources required) does not have a basis for existence in the first place.

Not being able to produce more currency at will DOES make the playing field significantly more equal. You can't downplay that. That is a complete change from our current system,
The difference will be that the group of bitcoin rich will not have their hand on a money faucet they can turn off and on at will to keep themselves on top. It is it out of their control. People will rise and fall in wealth on their own accord, finally.

Nope, I don't pay much attention to the media or funded studies, I'm just going off personal experience here.
I'm from California, where everyone and their brother owns a pitbull. 9 out of every 10 of these dogs are completely out of fucking control. No fight training or anything like that, just cooped up dogs that have too much energy. Everybody has to lock their pitbulls  in a room before letting their guests in. Again, no kind of attack or guard dog training. The owners certaintly don't want this behavior, to their guests at least. 
One of my friends pitbulls jumped their 6 foot backyard fence to get at a women walking her small dog on the sidewalk. 
I occasionally I have these problems with rottweilers/German shepards/boxers/mastiffs, but no with near as much frequency. Not even close.
I love pitbulls, but they require special care and training to behave well, training that most owners do not have the time or intelligence to give. The average person owning an average golden retriever is far less likely to inflict any kind of unitentional damage than that same person owning an average pitbull.
I don't care what the media or studies tell me because they have zero impact on the actual reality of these situations.

@_date: 2014-05-08 06:22:55


What I mean here is that you so emotionally criticize the entire institution in such a way that only a completely evil imbecile could make such mistakes. You say it with such a superior tone, as if certainly you could have done better. What do you think is more likely, that you are so superior to these people, or that you don't have complete knowledge of these actual situations? You are certainly superior to some, but also likely is there are smart people making the best decisions they can with the knowledge they have available.  I was more poking fun at you than anything else.


I know, that's what I was saying. It is very not black and white. Again, poking fun.


It is a position. History is full of superpowers(relative to enviroment size of course, only recently is that enviroment truly global) and entities attempting to become one. Historically, becoming and maintaining a superpower is very bloody. Unlikely to stop and certaintly not something to count on. Your opinions on whether they should exist or not of course don't matter, it is what is. Maybe it won't be forever, but a leader betting on it would be risking his population's lives on an unprecedented slim chance of world peace, which would be grossly irresponsible to them. 


Yes reasonably decent, much of the world is going through a financial crisis. We will see what happens. 
As far as dead civilians goes, look on the upside - we live in a world of nukes that have not been used yet.


Because we have history showing that love and puppies certainly weren't happening before us. Yes I can make an alternate reality of what if, because the US directly intervened in actions that would have mostly likely succeeded without us. Do you really think love and puppies were more likely to happen if Germany, Japan, and Italy had gone on the warpath unopposed? Possible I guess, but doubtful.


Obviously not. I am saying that if weren't us, it would likely be one of them. You disagree?  You are so sure they would handle the power better than we have? Whether you think there should be superpowers or not has no relevance.


Agreed. Civilians get caught in the middle. That does not mean the US set out to kill them.


"Oh you're sister got raped? Hey you should look on the bright side, much worse things could have happened!"
"Oh Hitler killed millions of jews? Hey at least it wasn't as bad as the Spanish Inquisition, am i right!"
No I am talking about managing expectations. Why would you expect our government to be the outlier saint of the powerful governments that have come before us? Of course we should shoot for it, but on what logical ground would you expect it? To me it seems that *most* of us are shooting for it, and I think we have gotten closer than our predecessors. Maybe by only a little, but it's a start.


Morality does not determine a nation's inventory of guns and tanks. This should be common sense.


That's cool. Yeah S. Korea, Jordan, kyrgyzstan, Phillippines etc. are happy to host us in exchange for the little peace of mind.


you can't just say "Well it was only 90% bad, therefore it's fine". Well you can do whatever you want, but it's not a very good argument.
Here's the thing though, I am not saying its 90% bad. I am arguing the opposite. Yes a few million people have died, but since the US came to power all major wars have stopped, *and the nukes have not flown*. Sorry man, I know that those millions of people dying probably did not directly stop the wars or nukes, but I have to point to those millions as a 10% or 20% of a bad that likely could have been. 


It gets little fuzzy here. No I certainly don't believe than any of the recent invasions were because of protection from terrorists. The only "terrorists" that matter, are the ones that have access to nuclear or biological weapons.
But its worth thinking a thought experiment through :
As a leader of a country, how many *innocent* foreigners lives is worth to stop a *potential* nuclear terrorist attack against *your* citizens?
If you had *uncertain* intelligence that a nuke threat was in an area, about to be transported into your country(once transport is underway, you've missed your chance), time was too limited for a raid search, do you bomb the whole neighborhood and kill every woman and child in it? What about the whole city?
Its certainly worth a few, but how many?
If your country was in a hostile stalemate with another, and any sign of weakness on your part *might* prompt an invasion from that country and endanger *your citizens*, what actions done in order to keep pace with that country constitute immorality? Snatching needed resources from a weaker country? Killing many of their people in the process?
A leader's duty is protect *their people* at all costs. That is what citizens expect more than anything, to kept safe from outsiders.
Where do you draw the line?
In the case of the hostile stalemate between two countries, the invasion of the weaker country in order to steal resources to protect the original country would forever denounced as evil. Yet in the position of the leader, it was the right thing to do.
Morality is not nearly as clear cut as you make it out to be. The world is an ugly place.
Getting tired, more to say though this is good. Will continue later.

Why would you expect Allaire or any businessman to have your best interests at heart? That is a naive expectation, and totally unnecessary. 
They expect to make money. That is the point of business. Fortunately in this scenario, them making money, selling bitcoin and bitcoin services, helps us. 
We need more bitcoins in the hands of the *public*, the sooner that happens the safer bitcoin is. It really does not matter in what manner they travel to the hands of the public. Because once they have the coins, they are no longer able to be controlled.

Because you need to interface with the legacy banking system in order to get a hold of some bitcoin, so fees will be involved. 
Once you have the coins its smooth sailing from there on. Kind of like how email is free, but to get a document into the system would require a scanner, which costs money. The exchanges are like the scanners, scanning your old fiat money into digital form. 
Don't know if that analogy works but I'm going to run with it.

But it is not a single minded entity deciding to spread FUD about bitcoin.
The MIC is an overall power trend, nothing more. 
As we have see in other industries, the little guys will attempt to use bitcoin to outpace and leapfrog their larger competitors, because their competitors depend more on the status quo than they do. The MIC is as likely to end up using bitcoin as anyone else because it is composed of many disagreeing entities, just like all other industries.

This. It's not about the current state of bitcoin, we are betting on the future state of bitcoin. We do not plan to hoard forever, I will be ready to spend as soon as the economy is ready for me. As the value (hopefully) increases, companies will work very hard to get me to part with my precious coins, and they will succeed. Feel free to bet on that as you see fit.
Also, we Americans have the worlds best currency, we have grown up with a stable currency as a fact of life. Please try to think a little bit out the box and realize that many, many countries do not have this "fact" in their lives. Bitcoin will be enticing to them, as it opens up the world of ecommerce to anyone with a cellphone, *not a credit card*.

@_date: 2014-04-16 22:42:57
This confused me at first as well. Basically say you generate your private key offline right? The software also generates the public key from that private key. At this point the bitcoin network has no idea you have done this. *Until* someone sends coin to your public key. That is they first time the network is aware of the existence of that address. The bitcoin are moved to that address(via the transaction being added to the next block). 
Now you hold that private key still, which only you know. When you go to the spend the new coins in that address, you must create a new transaction. That transaction is signed by your private key. It can be mathmatically verified that your public key and private key go together, without anyone knowing your actual key. 
It is not like usename/password thing that most people think of at first. The blockchain is not storing your private key and then matching your submission.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:54:21
The storage would probably be encrypted - even from the operator of the storage server.

They are both system based. One moves faster than the other. Fiat companies will get outpaced by a competitor than can move funds more quickly. Bitcoin will either implode, or fiat will be made obsolete. There is no middle ground.
@_date: 2014-04-11 03:58:47
Most assets do not have the "drug currency" and other controversies surrounding them. Bitcoin is also hailed as the future disruption of financial services, to back an asset with these qualities carries much additional weight. There really is nothing else comparable.
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:23:37
Not comparable. Most of us aren't absolutely sure bitcoin will succeed, but we have put the equivilant amount of money behind our thinking that it probably will.

@_date: 2014-04-13 22:27:34
Because with bitcoin's volatility, you're more likely to get caught a few times and lose your money. Especially since the volatility over the years has been trending upwards. Betting that it goes all the way to the bottom and waiting for it to happen seems the much safer and more profitable option. This is offset but the unreliability of exchanges though. So if there were a Wall Street grade exchange it seems shorting to the bottom would be wiser if you were so sure that bitcoin was going to be a failure.
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:58:34

Depends on what you think the point of bitcoin is. Some people think it is for everyone to store and manage their own money - I don't agree. Bitcoin to me is about having a currency that cannot be debased. Period.
Everything else is user preference. Bitcoin gives you the *choice*.
It is understandable that a lot of people are going to trust security experts with their money instead of their own non-expertise.

Yes, obviously, it is a stepping stone. And a hugely important one.
Plus, as(if) bitcoin rises, so will the value of these cards. The value of your credit card will not. More people would be willing to consider trying out bitcoin if they knew they could spend it everywhere.

Unless, of course, in the end turns out that Buffet really was wrong, and the CEO was right - then we did help you.
Other than that, believe what you want to believe. We are pretty set in our ways over here because most of us have long since done our research and came to the conclusions we currently believe in. We are not seeking advice from Buffet, especially when he doesn't voice any argument we haven't already heard and considered a long time ago, so Buffet's opinion isn't very valid to us and so, less important.

Interesting, I hadn't thought about Coinbase's "off-chain wallets". Blockchain.info wallets would still count towards the 250k total(with over a coin) though.

In my imagination I thought once this news hit, the Street would be abuzz and everybody would be ready to jump in just from such big players being pro Bitcoin. 
Do they think Novogratz and Burns are crazy/stupid, or what's the deal?
@_date: 2014-03-08 18:23:37
From the consumer standpoint there would be little difference(besides less fees and instant transfers, which is enough imo), but this really isn't the point. Banks provide a valuable service, having instant access to all your money at all times it not neccessarily a good thing. People are able to live more relaxed lives knowing that a single person cannot hold them at gunpoint and empty their life savings. This service is not going away. Banks are not going away, they will be "downgraded" into the institutions they used to be when they would store your gold for you. Protection and advisement. They will no longer have their hands on the faucet of the economy. The whole point of bitcoin is to remove human control of that faucet, everything else is left to individual preference. Many people, myself included, would like the security of having *some* of their assets insured and stored in a vault by a large, sue-able company. The beauty of bitcoin is this all becomes optional. But do not expect many people to wish to individually store and be responsible for the security of all their wealth.
@_date: 2014-05-08 06:32:17
Sure but just as we see the future potential of bitcoin to be used in a good way beyond the volume its being used today, they can see the future potential to be used a bad way fay beyond the volume its being used today. Goes both ways. Certainly worth an investigation.
@_date: 2014-03-18 06:00:53
So why dogecoin at all?
If you and others really care so much about charities, and not yourselves, why not do it through bitcoin?
Everything you all bring to the table could be used to help bitcoin and make a more positive experience for everyone. 
Bitcoin is on a mission to change the world and we need all the help we can get, dogecoiners are not helping by using their efforts to promote a dog meme instead helping all of us advance bitcoin.
If dogecoiners really care as much about good and charities as they profess, they should recognize they have a better chance of getting more donators and making a real difference through bitcoin.
The real fight is against the current banking system, that is the real help that can be given to the world, and we stand a better chance by not fragmenting ourselves early on.
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:18:47
wow! This is exactly what I have been looking for!
edit: This is huge. You realize that in the eyes of the average consumer that bitcoin just became viable as *real money*? Get bitcoins, get a pretty card, and spend basically anywhere?! Xapo has added so much value to the bitcoin network. This will legitimize bitcoin to a lot of laymen.

You keep not answering my questions.
1. Support whatever business you want, that doesn't make Circle a trojan horse or evil. More likely it just makes them smarter than the businessmen you support. Any businessman who believes in the freedom of bitcoin should support regulation - because it won't work in the long term. But it will get the coins out to the public in the short term, and that is more important right now.
2. "**IF** he and his cronies could find a regulatory way to prevent you from moving your coins". He can't. Nobody has brought up a single *feasible* way to accomplish this that won't *drive business out of the country*. If there was a way I would share your fear, but there isn't, so why slander people?

Don't be stupid, they're just playing the long game.
Appeasing regulators in the US *is the best move right now*. This will enable Americans to make a move on Bitcoin. Appeasement is the quickest way of getting coins in the hands of Americans.
Then, once Bitcoin goes mainstream, and that dragon rears its head, all those regulations they made in the beginning will be completely impossible to enforce, and the whole system will crumble anyway - BUT- Americans will already have those coins because they were bought in a regulated manner in the beginning, so America will have a strong footing in the new bitcoin world economy.
Don't try and hinder this regulation. This is the quickest way to get coins out and into the hands of the public. In the long run the changes you seek to see in the financial system WILL HAPPEN, because at the deepest level bitcoin is impossible to control.
Play the long game my friend.

Yes gawddammit I'm an American stuck in the Middle East right now and yes I know you accepting bitcoin won't help me get any, but holy hell the shit that I'm in right now I could use a few hundred 5.56s...
Anyways good luck to you and your company.
@_date: 2014-05-01 05:37:34
Maybe off topic. The blockchain can only become so valuable as it can stay secure. It can only stay secure by having many miners who maintain it. You can only attract enough miners to maintain it by compensating them with bitcoins. They will only work so much for compensation as the bitcoins themselves are valuable.
Bitcoin and the blockchain depend on each other.
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:20:00
Awesome. Let's confuse the fuck out of people.

I don't think so. In the mind of an old defense contractor guy : reporter with questions = denial of current involvement in any projects a reporter would care about. I am not sure he gave it more thought than that. You know how old people are.
@_date: 2014-05-08 02:40:27
... Well I guess I will go to get that last word in. 
You painted a very emotional picture of a "gargantuan elephant drenched in the blood of millions" and then talk about reasoned arguments?
You seem to be very assured of the evilness of the government, and of the goodness of everyone that they have killed. 
The crimes of the government should at the very least be compared the crimes of other powerful governments throughout history. We have seen much, much worse. 
Believe it or not, this world is composed mostly of good people trying to the do the best for them and theirs. On both sides.
The giant US war machine has killed many, but has also provided defense and stability for many countries of the world who would otherwise have to do it themselves and would unlikely be living in peace as much as they are. Many weak countries no longer live in fear of their neighbor outright invading because of the US military.
You are taking the easy argument, the simple route. It is easy to tally up the dead and sentence the government to damnation. But how do we know that there might not be hundreds of millions of bodies more if the US had not managed to keep many countries militaries at bay? If it had done things differently?
Try not to see the world in such black and white, it is easy to from below, but being put in a postition of power turns things oh so gray. Most choices will likely involve picking the least of two evils. Most people are doing their best and making a lot of mistakes, which is par for the course for humanity so far.  I think overall we are improving.
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:51:23

But your missing mine. A different breed of dog, kept under those same(normal) conditions would not result in such wild aggressive behaviour. 
The pitbulls are not kept in cages, they are not mistreated, they have small backyards and the same conditions that most other pet dogs of a similar size are subjected to.
This is why I am tired of people buying pitbulls, they are not your average dog and should not be bought on a whim as pets because they are "cool".
Again, *left under the care of the average dog owner most pitbulls will end up earning their reputation.*

@_date: 2014-03-14 17:30:41
Possibly, but the difference is that the USD *is* fractional reserve banking. *There is no underlying asset to debase in the first place.*
Bitcoin is easily auditable with cryptographic proof. Fractional reserve banking might still happen will bitcoin, but it will never run buck wild like it has with the dollar. A company might get away with it, for a while, but the underlying asset will not be compromised. This is a far superior system.
@_date: 2014-04-27 01:56:50
"They" referring to central organizations that can make decisions about who become members.
Bitcoin is not. Anyone can join who has internet access. Anyone who does not join, does not want to.
The comparison is stupid.
It is not a common bitcoiner argument just because one person said it.
@_date: 2014-01-11 01:27:28

...so what are you saying? Obviously there is bias, there should be bias.
Price discovery will continue in the booms and crashes it has always had. There is simply no other way it could happen. 
To become stable would be attractive, which would result in more investors attracted to bitcoin, which would create another bubble. Which would create instability, people would disbelieve the price, it will crash again. Until it regains stability at a new level, which attracts more investors etc etc.
@_date: 2014-04-28 20:39:41
I don't think this is necessary. Traders understand they are operating in a low liquidity high-risk enviroment, and so this is all part of the game.
People and organizations are pretty much in their rights do whatever they want to aquire more bitcoins(short of blatant robbery) - free market.
This doesn't affect your average hodler, and if anything newcomers to the market are grateful for the low prices.
Besides, if everyone wants coins, this can only last so long anyways.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:42:21
Creating difficult regulations between dollars and bitcoin will only incentivize the creation of a closed loop bitcoin economy. Not because of anything idealistic, but because this loop would save money and *move faster*. Any companies left outside this fast loop will move money around too slow to be competitive.
The real genius of bitcoin is not the code, it is the system of incentives.

If we can agree that pitbulls are a stupid choice for a pet if you cannot provide the right enviroment or care for it, and we can agree that most people cannnot or do not, and we can agree that the price for failing to provide this care for the dog is akin to toture and can result in danger to others, then shouldn't we try to stop most people from buying them in the first place? For both the dogs themselves and the neighborhoods their raised in?

Yes, but that is pure idealism.
I know that pitbulls aren't mindless killers, but who really cares?
We care about their effect on reality. Pitbulls won't naturally rip your arm off, they are not evil, but a pitbull raised in our box houses with our lifestyles might be driven insane enough to do so.
Same with a tiger, or wolf or whatever. This is no idealistic reflection on the animal itself, just on the reality of it's place in our extremely crowded neighborhoods.

Dude that is literally the only instance. 
Compared to the millions of other products you would buy that won't have that conflict. 
Only geeks even know what bits are anyway, normal people won't use that word.

What makes me somewhat hopeful is that I think bitpay was actually referring to blockchain.info in their tweet "when *we* say big". I think it might be seriously big news, especially with the " hashtag. Definitely referring to price increase, so I imagine the news should be big to the general public as well as their company. Probably signed a large merchant.

No one I know owns even a half an acre of land. 
If you performed an experimental raising in normal conditions with average owners, with the only variable being the breed of dogs, I think  pitbulls would likely and up the most violent and out of control. Thus, their reputation would be rightfully earned.
What you are describing are conditions similar to those required for raising horses. Horses aren't considered pets.
It is recognized that horses require special enviroments and training to be raised in.
If pitbulls require similar conditions, then the same holds true, that they make for shitty pets.

I would agree with you if bitcoin was a normal stock or commodity, but it's not. Talking a bitcoin book in this enviroment is an *entirely* different statement then  saying Twitter is overvalued or that gold is a good buy for the next 6 months. Surely you can appreciate that.

Yes but those are far less likely to be *transactions*. More akin to Facebook likes. So I would expect the transaction volume to be higher.

You have rallied behind a marketing scheme. I just find it kind of dissapointing I guess. It seems like a man took some other product, took some other mascot, neither of his own invention, combined them and released it for profit - and you all bought it hook, line and sinker.
To each his own, but I wish dogecoiners would trying seeing the bigger picture. We need your guys' energy to help us change the world, not further an individual's sales gimmick.

Well reported. I could see the difference in understanding from your first video compared to your last. Open-minded journalists are a rarity. Keep up the good work in subjects not related to bitcoin as well!

It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if Overstock holds them or not, from the consumer standpoint the transaction is already *done*. What matters is that Overstock.com products are *available for purchase with bitcoin.* That is accepting them.

I agree. I think the first CAR manufacturer accepting bitcoin title rightfully goes to you.
