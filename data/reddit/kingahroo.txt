Sounds like ya shoulda bought more BTC l!!! lmao

There's a "spread" between current Market and Limit amount. Like if you set a limit for 3 BTC at $11,000, the price would prob have to get to $11,010-11,020 for it to sell. It depends on the exchange you're using. If it's a sudden drop it might only liquidate 2 out of the 3 you preset so that last 1 lingers until it reaches $11k again or you cancel it

It's like a stock that fluctuates 24/7. Its like Vegas non-stop lol you can get off the roller coaster whenever you want. But unlike stocks, you get no dividends and no special Gov protections. Once you're in, it's solely you versus the speculators/futures market/sellers/shorters, ect lol

Prediction Time: Will BTC be over or under $9,500 later today!?!

Whatever price you set the Limit for, once reaches it, it automatically sells/liquidates whatever amount you pre-set it for. Market sale just executes the sale in the *range* of the current price. Limit is very precise, Market is not.
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:02:21

Woke up to BTC at $9,475 (+125) so if i cashed out right now I'd take a $406 profit. Meh can't complain, made more sleeping than when I work a 12hr OT shift lol
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:59:35
Yeah I'm noticing the same bullshit. I set a limit price then the Live price dips $10-15 below my limit price and the transaction *still* doesn't complete.. Their shit is wayyy off right now idk why they're not communicating this to their users...
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:45:08
