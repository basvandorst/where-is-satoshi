Except it’s not just me using TA to make correct predictions. There are people who do this for a living who make more correct predictions than incorrect predictions, and that’s due to TA. It’s literally just pattern recognition, it’s the most basic component of intelligence.
Markets are not some completely random, unpredictable thing. Obviously there’s a limit to what you can predict, but TA can greatly improve your accuracy. There’s very little chance I would’ve gotten those two specific predictions right without TA.

I think we could be seeing a ["3 bar play"]( forming in the daily charts right now. Should probably be trending upwards, in my expert youtube opinion.

Nah, it’s called pattern recognition you dope. The only two real predictions I’ve made so far have been correct, so I’m not just picking the correct ones and ignoring the incorrect ones.
Astounding how proudly ignorant this sub is lol.
 “TA Is buLLsHitt, SO your PRedIction Will bE WroNG!!”
(Is actually spot on with the prediction)
“NOoo that DOESNt Count!!! Confirmation bAis!!! If you WroNG you Full OF SHit. If you RIgHT?? You FULL of shIT!!”

And the name of your logical fallacy is: Argument from Authority!
Have trouble thinking freely? Just let someone else do the thinking for you! The smart scientist and government men have it all under control. 
Just please don’t question why the models and predictions have been consistently wrong. It’s very unscientific to question Science.

And the name of your logical fallacy is: Ad Hominem!

The reason surface measurements “confirm” the rise and satellite measurements don’t is because ground measurements are much more easily manipulated, along with being subject to such distortions as the heat sink effect.
Organizations like NOAA and NASA adjust past measurements downwards and more recent measurements upwards to create a highly exaggerated warming trend:
I remember years back, satellite data was considered the most reliable...until it became apparent that it was showing a lack of significant warming. Then all of a sudden it turned out that the “orbits were off” and then they decided that the satellite data had to be “corrected” too. The whole thing is laced with so much bullshit.

Yea and this is just the tip of the iceberg (pun intended). Global warming is propaganda, not science. Actual science involves changing your hypothesis when it doesn’t match up with the data. Not massaging and cherrypicking data to support a preordained conclusion.

Just curious, how do you know that it’s fake?

I was actually 100% right....
EDIT: And that makes two in a row I've gotten right. The first being that we would bottom out in the 7.7-7.8k range (posted in the price talk chat many days back when ppl were predicting it would go way down to 6k or further), due to the double bottom that had already formed in that area. I didn't feel that the selling pressure was high enough to break us past that support.
So yea TA actually can work. The market has patterns and cycles that one can recognize and exploit before they happen.

It SHOULDNT win me a debate if the person is making other sound arguments. But when the argument is entirely a logical fallacy, then simply pointing it out exposes their empty rhetoric. 
Ad hominem attacks and arguments from authority really are the favorite go-to’s for climate change fanatics. It allows them to make all these pretend arguments without actually addressing the underlying science. I mean I don’t care if 110% of scientists believe in something, it doesn’t make it true. It just makes it popular.
And claiming that I’m cherry picking the science is wrong too. In the context you’re using it, a cherry picking fallacy would be if I picked a handful dissenting papers to create a false picture that it actually represents the majority opinion. Another would be if you could show that the actual sources I used are cherry picking the data to come to their conclusions (i.e. showing that the source I used cherry picked satellite data/predictions to create a false impression). But simply using sources that represent the minority opinion is not a fallacy.
