illegal? we live in the "wild west." i would not be so quick to assume someone or some company would obay laws when there are large somes of money... hell HSBC and another bank (cant think off the top of my head) got caught manipulating the gold and silver market, again..... and yes there is a law that forbids that... what did they get? a slap on the wrist... that is in a regulated market...
