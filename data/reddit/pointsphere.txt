How exactly does this change anything?
Votes on websites are just an expression of opinion.
The real vote is the majority of people and miners running the software with the features they want.
You can make a client with 50BTC blockreward forever TODAY. But you would have to get enough people to actually run it.
Being open source, it's simply impossible to set anything in stone.

It's really weird that one main talking point of many core supporters is "decentralization", while at the same time advocating that only one group of people is authorized to make decisions.
It makes no sense, if other people have different ideas and garner support for those, then this is decentralization as well.
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:05:17
1. Still marginal cost of production, coupled with opportunity cost. If my mining hardware is paid off AND I have free energy AND free bandwidth, that leaves me with the decision whether I should mine or use free energy and bandwidth for something else.  
From calculating the possible profits from "something else" you can derive the fees below which mining would be a loss.
Commercial miners will only keep mining as long as their profit from mining exceeds the profits from using their energy/bandwidth for something else.  
Furthermore, IF there was no real cost to mining BUT you have lots of merchants and users using the network, you might assume that merchants would start mining simply to keep the network running. 
It does not cost them anything, but they gain a working finance network.
2. Self-correcting, yes, in that users either start a bidding war, or give up and look for cheaper alternatives. Not the best course of action for a network still in its infancy.  
Yes, it would happen with unlimited blocksize too, but I'd prefer to have it happen when Bitcoin is used by billions of people, not while the network is still growing slowly.  
Orphan risk seems to be highly dimished by the recent "Xtreme Thinblocks", which seems like a drastic improvement and incentivizes keeping a pool of most transactions in the first place.
3. My point of view is that it is a bottleneck as long as demand for blockspace exceeds supply, which indeed means theoretically unlimited blocksize capped only by what miners and nodes are willing to relay and process. 
4. I suppose by the way we do it now: Form your own opinion, then get every forum/media/user engaged in a rational debate/giant shouting match. Re-check opinion again, and act based on all the information you can get.

Really simple: some people (many) want an increased blocksize of 2MB, and some don't. This has turned into a huge debate, and currently it looks like the blocksize will increase to 2MB soon. 
The increase will probably happen through the new "Bitcoin Classic" software instead of the incumbent "Bitcoin Core". This has, for different reasons, increased the scope of the debate.
If you try to look further for all the different opinions, you should check this subreddit as well as others, since the presented views and arguments differ quite a bit between these subreddits.
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:42:33
It is only set in stone because we all accept it to be this way.
Everyone knows it's one of the cornerstones of Bitcoin. But the technical reality is that it could indeed be changed, since we're not bound to it by any inescapable law of physics.
So while everyone agrees it is "set in stone", it really only is this way because we all agree, not through some law of nature.

I believe he meant it, and in the unlikely event they can develop a robust voting system it would be an improvement. 
Let's compare:
1.) People vote on feature and have a place to voice their opinion.
2.) Feature might get implemented because people voted for it.
3.) Two possible outcomes: People are either happy and continue to use the software, or people are unhappy and start using a different software.
1.) Feature gets implemented, opinion of anyone except Core is irrelevant.
2.) People are either happy and continue to use the software, or are unhappy and start using a different software.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:18:14
Absolutely both.
2MB now to fight network congestion immediately, and keep access to the basic Bitcoin network as cheap and moderately fast as it used to be.  
Continue to test and implement features for higher efficiency and eventually 2nd layer scaling solutions.
The first layer needs to stay cheap and accessible, the way it has worked for the last 7 years. Especially while the userbase is still growing.

What a load of FUD.
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:54:18
You have any numbers to back that up?
Seems to me like there are slightly more people asking for bigger blocks.
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:10:19
Opening a new channel costs fees for a funding transaction, if I'm not mistaken. So you'll try to avoid opening and closing channels too often. 
Keeping a channel open and watch out for fraud requires you to either stay online, or to outsource keeping that channel open and watching the network.
Keeping routing functional at all times requires routing tables.
Keeping fees as low as it is promised means connecting to a high-availibility node with high connectivity, as opposed to routing through several hops.
I can see the appeal of instant confirmations and high throughput, but it does not seem more decentralized.
@_date: 2016-01-17 14:16:00
"Chaos" is a total conjecture.
By now there are lots of users, miners and businesses asking for a block size increase, and quite a few simply wanting to see Core removed from their position of "do as we say, because we know better than you".
Just try a different sorting for this thread for a simple indicator.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:33:24
Yeah I'd assume many would just say "oh well, apparently people want this change" and simply continue.
@_date: 2016-01-24 19:28:46
hahaha how flattering, thank you!
blessed be this fork
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:29:19
With increased adoption you get more users and merchants/service providers.
Many of those merchants and service providers rely on correct blockchain data, so they have a high incentive to run nodes, just as they run webservers now.
More users -&gt; more merchants -&gt; more nodes.
Also there is no clear indication that it stays decentralized with the currently proposed solution of Lightning. To quote from their whitepaper:






So: "core Tier-1 routes [...] online all the time" with "high connectivity" and "better security".
That sounds an awful lot like a job for specialized servers in datacenters.
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:58:42
thanks! yes, due to strong demand it will be crowdfunded, engineered, tested and released in ~2 weeks
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:13:07
False dilemma, many people ask for both increased blocksize as well as other performance improvements.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:26:00
Near-free transactions on the base network are also part of the original vision.
And while Lightning Network keeps being sold as a solution for transaction capacity, I fail to see how it improves decentralization.
The Lightning paper says it is likely that there will be nodes which are always online, with high bandwidth and connectivity, low latency and high security. 
Quote: "Eventually, with optimizations, the network will look a
lot like the correspondent banking network, or Tier-1 ISPs."
This does not sound like  decentralization to me.
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:46:39
I signed up for the "currency of the people", but I feel no longer represented by Core.
Because the debate has been going on for over a year, but they have now made it clear that there will be no compromise, and that they supposedly know better than me. 
And it does not help that they completely failed to speak out against the censorship that happened on the two biggest forums.
@_date: 2016-01-23 14:26:33
Good luck trying to find a majority to change the coin limit.
It's so simple to understand that every additional coin will devalue every existing coin that I have a hard time believing a change of the limit would ever find widespread support.
If this fork goes through all it shows is that change is possible if a majority/the market wants and supports it.
@_date: 2016-01-18 18:37:50


Really? For me it's just the other way round, one main value proposition is the resistance against centralized control.
And if someone thinks their fork is better, they "only" have to convince enough people to join them, and it becomes the new standard. 
Sounds pretty democratic to me.
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:44:14
Oh, ok.
Then I haven't been around long enough.

Well, in the event of Bitcoin not being what I expect it to be, I have two main options: voice my concern, or leave.
I've tried arguing for change for a year now, and it seems now that there will never be a compromise.
So I will indeed leave. But apparently together with a lot of people.

Well, and this is already debatable.
Most users don't need to, that's the whole point behind SPV wallets.
The issue was foreseeable and the discussion has been going on for a year, yet nothing has happened, and blocks are now constantly full.
Yes,probably not everyone will be able to run a node at very large blocksizes. But even if we raised blocksize tomorrow to 8MB, you could easily run a node on an i5 and a 0.5MBit connection.
With very large blocks the theory is that most nodes will be run by companies, service providers and enthusiasts.

EVERY parameter in Bitcoin can be changed, and always could. 
You can make a version with more coins today, but it would still require you to get enough miners and nodes to actually run your software.
There is no way you can set anything in stone in Bitcoin. If enough people want something, they were and are always free to fork the code and run their own version.

2MB is the fastest method to clear the ongoing transaction backlog right now.

I want cheap transactions, not free.
And I want enough capacity for transactions to stay cheap.
Miners are subsidized by the block reward, supporting them through fees alone is not needed yet.
Actually, it should be in the miners' best interest to onboard as many people as possible, since more volume means more fees.
No-one is arguing for free transactions.
And I disagree with your assessment: BTC price will jump drastically once the blocksize is raised, because all the media reports will state "Bitcoin doubles transaction capacity!" and "Deadlock in Blocksize debate resolved!".
Also, calling people terrorists because they don't agree with you seems quite aggressive.

How can marginal cost be zero if you need hardware, electricity and bandwidth to mine transactions?
@_date: 2016-01-20 17:30:40
That's the faulty assumption that there is any kind of control over the protocol.
There is not, anybody can fork it and try to mobilize enough users to run their software. This effectively means you only have control as long as the majority is with you.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:41:46
1.) With unlimited space, fees go down to the marginal cost of production. Low, but not zero. You still need to pay a fee to ensure your transaction is prioritized by miners or even relayed by nodes in the first place.
2.) We know that transactions go in limbo with full blocks because that is what is [happening RIGHT NOW]( 
RBF does not help, if I raise my fee to be included someone else will have to wait, or start a bidding war.
3.) Luckily we only have ...3? 5? million users. Still time to figure out how to serve 7 billion people once we clear the current bottleneck.
5.) The term "economic majority" was first coined by [Meni Rosenfeld]( and said 


I'm a user, I agree with change. But the point is there is no hard definition of "economic majority", we're still figuring out the balance between users, miners, businesses and developers.
@_date: 2016-01-23 20:04:06
You keep them in whatever storage you have now and simply wait. 
Your bitcoin are on your private key(s), which will be valid on both sides of the fork.
So simply wait until it's over and one side has the majority. Also make sure your wallet software supports that side of the fork once it's over.
That's it.
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:37:04

Even then, there *is* a cost to producing a block, which is non-zero.

Hold on, you're arguing that:
1.) Bitcoin needs to stay decentralized.
2.) And it should scale, but only on a second layer.
3.) It doesn't matter if the second layer is centralized.
So 5$ per transaction is okay, even if this forces most users on a centralized 2nd layer, as long as you can stay in the decentralized 1st layer. And 5$ is nothing to you.
Did I get that correctly?
@_date: 2016-01-28 14:30:45
Why? People can vote, it's just an expression of opinion. 
People could vote on anything, and it would not have any effect.
The only vote that counts is how many people run the code they want, anything before that is just discovery of opinions.
@_date: 2016-01-26 01:00:46
Yes, running a system with 3-5 million users at full capacity at all times is fine, and not at all a cause for concern. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 16:11:59
[edit: ok I get it, was just confused]
I'd remove it from clearing and just say "cheap" instead of "free" at transportation. Since sending a TX is the usual mode of transport for Bitcoin.
It was never free (if you want in the next block) and will probably never be.

@_date: 2016-01-23 20:23:44
Your explanation is confusing and makes limited sense.
The most likely outcome is that there will be only one chain after a short while.
In the event your scenario happens, here's the elegant way:
- Backup your private keys
- Install wallet that supports fork A
- Install wallet that supports fork B
- Import private keys in both, spend them however you like.

LN faces exactly the same centralization of processing nodes that a blocksize increase supposedly brings.
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:05:14
Yes they are, you can check for yourself at 
Nearly all full 1MB blocks, with a constantly full mempool.
@_date: 2016-01-23 21:56:52
I can't find any info what kind of machine was used to simulate those 32MB blocks, do you know?
Also the bottleneck described in the simulation (ECDSA signature verification) has been improved so it will now be 2.5-5.5 faster, so your statement becomes "at 64MB blocks, we know modern desktop PCs can keep up alright with the demands of block processing".
And what exactly is the "right" number of nodes?
Here's my theory: as Bitcoin grows, more users and merchants join in because of the higher reach and utility. 
And there will indeed be less users running full nodes. 
Instead, nodes will increasingly be run by companies who have to make absolutely sure that they have complete and correct blockchain data at all times. Exchanges, wallet providers, payment processors, anyone using OP_RETURN for their business.
There's a good chance that increased adoption will lead to less, but more capable nodes.
However, right now everyone who actually wants to run a full node can do so, as you said yourself, up to 32MB blocks are not a problem.
@_date: 2016-01-23 19:51:43

That's what I suspect, not many payment processors because the most efficient LN configuration is for everyone to open a channel with the 1 node that is always online and that everyone else uses.
You'll also need routing to connect node A with node B, which is hard to accomplish in a decentralized way.
Centralized routing however works well, and could easily be run on those well-connected nodes.
Finally I worry about security of the basic Bitcoin network. If everyone uses LN and there are no on-chain transactions apart from the settlement transactions, they would have to have high fees to make mining them attractive. It is unknown if it will even work like this, or if miners would prefer to mine transactions with lower fees, but lots of them.
I would not mind all of this if it stays possible to opt out of Lightning and still use vanilla Bitcoin with low fees, but the way it is currently proposed would mean that we have small blocks filled with expensive settlement transactions, so you're either forced to use LN, or pay high fees, or be priced out altogether.

Miners seem to be doing fine, and several still support larger blocks. Many [supported 8MB]( months ago.
They make money if few people pay high fees, but they also make money if a lot of people pay a lower fee. But the utility of Bitcoin is dimished by high fees, which could cause users and businesses to leave.
And I actually use bitcoin to pay online, not only as a store of value. Therefore I'd like to keep the fees per transaction at 5 cent at most.

- [Bitcoin Roundtable]( (Antpool, Bitmain, Bitfury, BTCC, F2Pool, Huobi) : "This hard-fork is expected to include [..] an increase in the non-witness data to be around 2 MB"
- [F2Pool again](
- [Bitpay supports adaptive Blocksize]( [Slush]( supports 2MB, [KnC 8](
- [Breadwallet]( supports both Core and an increase
- Coinbase (no citation needed)

This would resemble gold backing. 
The central bank would lose the ability to influence the economy through monetary policy, so they will never do it.
They will try to make all money digital, it's beginning in Sweden already. But only through the existing system, or maybe a private blockchain where they can control inflation.
A central bank accepting Bitcoin as the official (backing) currency would mean giving up most of their power, and basically admitting defeat.
It would only happen if the central banks' money would be widely perceived as less secure and less stable than Bitcoin.

I think nearly everyone supports CT, you won't find much of a split here.
@_date: 2016-02-03 13:08:56
What if I told you that they have no plan how decentralized routing is supposed to work, and that this will lead to exactly the kind of centralization you see as such a danger?
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:10:38
So a company without a transparent business model employing several main Bitcoin devs gets truckloads of money.
And somehow this is consistent with the narrative of those devs acting solely in the interest of their users.
I don't buy it.

Turns out I was wrong about pruning (never used it), apparently it already works during the initial download. So that 16gb drive can also work.
Yes, I believe you need a client to sync it.
I simply formatted my drive as fat32 and set it as the bitcoin data directory on the pi as well as my main pc.
Synced on the main pc, then moved the drive to the pi.
@_date: 2016-02-06 05:24:48
Indeed they are.
@_date: 2016-02-10 17:36:25
Their security model is "predefined functionaries" for maintaining the peg, and "tamperproof boxes" for keeping them honest.
I wish I was making this up.
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:54:03
Well their letter clearly says "block size increase" several times. 
I'd assume they know what that means, being Bitcoin experts and all.
Also most people here understand that segwit is efficient and fixes problems. Nearly everybody wants it.
As for Lightning, it's really complicated because even the people developing it have no idea if it will work. It's unclear how to make it decentralized, and what the consequences would be for miners and security if Bitcoin is only a settlement network. And many people do not agree with the "settlement network only"-idea.
@_date: 2016-02-09 18:08:02
It's not.
Some people are trying to make it to seem like this means that we will have 8GB blocks tomorrow.
In reality, even a connection with 256kbps upstream is currently enough to support 2MB blocks and a handful of nodes you could upload to.
@_date: 2016-02-10 17:33:22
Your question is funny, because "being able to run a full node" has been one of the main arguments of smallblock supporters for quite some time. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 14:00:22
What exactly are those "multiple scaling methods with a solid plan"?
SegWit is a one-time only increase, after that Core's "scalability faq" lists exactly nothing. Go see for yourself:
@_date: 2016-02-01 16:12:13
Or: a successful fork improves confidence that Bitcoin is indeed capable of evolving and overcoming obstacles. 
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:44:04
When you say "we", who are you talking about?
The Bitcoin I learned about years ago is supposed to be inclusive and accessible to anyone in the world at low cost, not arbitrarily limited because of a few developers trying to dictate that it has to be a settlement layer.
You're talking about misleading statements and confusing the public? 
If Core has any other plan for raising base capacity besides a 2nd layer that might or might not work, and which might or might not be decentralized, then why can't they add a simple "switch to X MB Blocks in Jan 2017" to their roadmap? Even though Adam Back himself proposed 2-4-8?
And, if the reasons for their decisions are so convincing, then why are there so many pro-core-posters who don't argue, but instead spew hateful language all day long, calling everyone who disagrees a shill, mob, terrorist, dumb, uneducated, incompetent?
And why do so many of those same posters always bring up the "it must stay small and decentralized!"-argument, while at the same completely ignoring that all available data points to the assumption that LN nodes will be just as centralized and susceptible to censorship as any normal node?
This is not the Bitcoin I signed up for.
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:14:17


So I went and educated myself (again).
And it turns out Liquids security model is still based on "tamperproof boxes". I'm relieved, no-one has ever managed to tamper with anything tamperproof.
Meanwhile, Lightning (apart from not existing) also faces centralization of nodes, because routing is hard, and because the best way to use lightning is really to just have 1 channel with the 1 node that is always online and that everyone else uses.
If this doesn't run counter to decentralization then I don't know what does.
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:37:49
July 2017.
Oh well.
@_date: 2016-02-03 20:50:25
Ok so the people who have money are paying the main developers to build an Internet of Money, but all in the name of decentralization and to the benefit of all of us.
Got it!
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:00:43
It's quite obvious that Core is only agreeing to a compromise because they now feel the pressure, with different clients ready and the biggest miner having already mined a few blocks with one.
I don't care about their motivations. They have been blocking the increase for political reasons, not technical. 
And all that "consensus" talk has been pissing me off, because apparently it only meant that you need to listen to Core, but Core does not need to listen to anyone else. 
This only changed because again, they now feel threatened of being abandoned.
Also you should not reference bitcoinocracy for your arguments, I traced some of the biggest (&gt;500 btc) votes and big surprise, it turns out most of them belong to a single person. You can check it on coinseer. Not a good basis for any argument.
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:59:32
1 guy says something nice, great.
$76 Million, and all of the investors want to "prioritize public good over returns"?
Not believable.
@_date: 2016-02-03 19:46:28
I'm sorry but "hard-fork to use space created by IBLT/weak blocks" makes only limited sense.
Weak blocks improve miner incentive to mine full blocks by letting them know the next likely block. Nothing about "space".
IBLT improves miner incentive to mine full blocks by reducing propagation time to nearly nothing, and cutting bandwidth by 50%. Is this the "space" adam meant? If so, "thinblocks" [are already being tested]( , providing a 30-49% cut in bandwidth.
And if "increase base capacity after segwit/iblt/weak blocks" is indeed proposed by devs, why is it not included in their scalability roadmap?
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:39:48
I think we should stop debating based on logic, data and good arguments, and instead focus solely on account age.
Because that's the one metric that truly counts.

All available data shows that 2MB could be rolled out right now without any negative effect on decentralization. There's not even a counterargument from Core apart from "we won't.".
You want expensive transactions? Now? While the miners are still heavily subsidized?
@_date: 2016-02-28 20:29:55
Without proof for your claim of "lot of money poured into propaganda" your posts are exactly the kind of "little actual discussion" you decry.

So you agree they must have other interests?
@_date: 2016-02-11 16:06:01
All the people who signed want an increase of the block size, and they'd still prefer to get it from Core.
Should Core continue to refuse to include it in the roadmap, the threat to be abandoned is now more real than ever, with Classic being ready for production and enough nodes online to support a switch.
Seems like it's a bit early for the anti-increase crowd to "pop the champagne".
@_date: 2016-02-20 19:40:10
That's all assumption, so here's another one: a fork goes through, everything continues working, price stays the same because everyone sees that the sky didn't fall.

True Sidechains would instantly end any debate about upgrades, too bad they still don't work.
I do hope it gets solved though, it would make upgrades and testing and switching much easier.
Also it would end all scammy "IPO"-based altcoins and  their pump'n'dumps, which is a nice bonus.
Here's the old [whitepaper]( by blockstream, it does a pretty good job of explaining the requirements of a true sidechain, and how it unfortunately does not quite work yet.
@_date: 2016-02-01 02:28:33
Massively improved by any of the "thinblocks" proposals which are currently either planned (Core) or already being tested (BU), which means that if you have received most of the transactions, you already have most of the block and just need the missing transactions to build it yourself.
Cuts down on the required bandwidth to get the newest block anywhere between 40 und 98%.
So yeah, with 5 open connections 1.5Mbps upstream would be enough.
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:02:43
Unlikely, there is no real way for anyone else to know how many transactions nodes are processing.
The only benefits are higher trust in the accuracy of the blockchain data, privacy when checking address balances, and being praised for your selfless altruism.

No, your post clearly says "Bitcoin is a settlement layer", while I see Bitcoin as a currency even without a 2nd layer.

I used the guide you linked and also this one: 
And the initial sync will take forever on the rpi, so I synced it on a faster computer before moving it to the pi.
~~Also IIRC you need to download the whole blockchain before you can prune it.~~ 
~~So you'll need that 128gb flash drive, at least for initial download.~~ Pruning already works during the initial download.

I run it on a Raspberry Pi 2, because it only consumes 5W of power and can do a lot of other things.
I used this tutorial: 
It's a bit of work, but since the rpi2 is relatively cheap and can do so many other things (and because I like tinkering), it was the best option for me.
Cost was about $150 for rpi2+128gb usb storage, and of course the 5W for the rpi. Also you should ideally have no data cap.

The only thing they can do (and are already doing) is to make exchanges comply with KYC/AML-laws.
They might also try to outlaw or regulate localbitcoins/openbazaar/mycelium local trader , which would probably put a chilling effect on person-to-person exchange.
And blacklisting does work to a certain degree, as they could force exchanges to reject coins suspected to come from a blacklisted exchange.
So while unenforceable, this can definitely cause a chilling effect.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:48:45
I'm talking about the general concept (which Core has on their roadmap), and you're already shooting my post down.
[You yourself said:](


Also, are you talking about the relay network which is currently run on 6 servers? The Thinblocks implementation I read about is not even supposed to replace that, altough it comes very close, is faster, and can easily be run by any node, thereby making it truly decentralized.

If you're from the US, try Circle or Coinbase to get coins, they're relatively easy to use and trustworthy.
You should enable the "2FA" security if you make an account there, it does improve security by a lot.
Armory is good, altough a little unwieldy. A smaller good wallet is Electrum. A good wallet for iOS is breadwallet, for Android Mycelium or "Bitcoin Wallet" by Andreas Schildbach.
