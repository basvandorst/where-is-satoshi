It's not miners that will need the equipment, just somebody who's listening to transactions being broadcast:
1) Quantum villain receives unconfirmed transaction at one of his many, listening nodes.
2) Immediately cracks key.
3) Floods a double spend to own wallet.
But yes, as long as cracking takes longer than confirming a transaction, we should still be safe. It would still feel rather... unpleasant. Besides, at this time it's pretty much impossible to say at this point how long the cracking would take, because we have no proper quantum computers and it is unknown when or even if we will get them.
So, to make things short: Until further notice EC signatures are perfectly safe, as long as nobody uses a messed up PRNG etc.

If you manage to remember those tens and hundreds of passwords without writing them down in some form... you are a rare specimen.
Most people can't do that. They either use the same password in multiple places (very bad) or store their passwords in some way.
There's also the matter that an attacker first has to have the file you store your encrypted passwords in, before they can attack the master password. For your website passwords, they can attack them without ever having access to your PC.
If the attacker has gained access to your PC and thus your password store, they probably also have installed a key logger and will get all your passwords anyway, sooner or later.
Edit: This is less valid if your password manager is one of those that store your passwords in the cloud. Don't do that.

Possession (direct control) and ownership are, at least where I live, two separate concepts. You can possess the private key, which lets you control the coins in the corresponding address. Legally, you may or may not own the balance associated with it. It depends on how you gained control over the funds. If you are an accountant working for a company, you probably do not own them, even if you possess the private key.
The technical implementation matters less in this regard. In the end, the whole system is just bits that are manipulated according to rules specified using other bits. Meaning such as ownership is imbued by the humans using the system and their agreement on what different parts of the system mean.
I once read [this]( article, which I found quite insightful with respect to the law and information encoding related issues.

I've recently actually taken a look at the source code, but I still have no idea what to think about it. The "self-encryption" business seems questionable at least.
Meanwhile, we have alternative approaches for "a new internet", which seem to communicate their purpose better, such as I2P and GNUnet. There's also still Freenet and Tor hidden services. Lots of approaches, really, all with a somewhat different focus.

The data is encrypted using a hash of the other pieces as the key though. That means that if you already now what data you are looking for (e.g. a file leaked by a whistleblower), you can self-encrypt it yourself and then find where the pieces are stored if the routing between the nodes storing the pieces and requesting the pieces isn't anonymizing.

Obviously Bitcoin can support additional address schemes, but that doesn't solve the problem of how to securely move coins from an already broken scheme to adresses of a new one.


Depending on the implementation this might prove helpful. To be sufficiently effective, I suppose it would be necessary to add the hash to the blockchain. Otherwise, a doublespend could still be successful, from how I see it? Otherwise, once the transaction is revealed, the quantum computer could publish its own hash and corresponding transaction before the actual transaction is confirmed.
To use Guy Fawkes signatures, from how I see it, bootstrapping using a regular signature function is still required.

There are a lot of things wrong with that post.


It isn't a directory. It's a device node, which is treated like a file. Relating it to a directory makes no sense.


I didn't ask to keep it simple. I merely wished to object to the misuse of technical jargon in a way that unsuspecting people might consider factual information.
Misinformation begets misinformation. Let's not help it spread.


Computers usually do as they are told. Simply tell them not to do that. It's pretty easy. I should know...


That depends on the adversary. If they can hack the server, install a network sniffer and are able to do global timing attacks things might look less nice. Granted, this is nitpicking of sorts.


Nonsense. Don't install a syslogd. Switch off the logging directives in the configuration files of whatever stuff you need to run your service. Easy as pie.


Depending on the threat model, that is either "trivial" or "impossible, outside of a cold boot attack". I suppose you could average that to "extremely difficult"...


Maybe. So, what.


It is not the same. If you disable logging for whatever thing you are using, it doesn't try to write a logfile. If you tell it to log to /dev/null, an attacker could delete /dev/null, change the permissions of /dev/ to be world writable and coerce your "non-logging" service to write logs to disk. Admittedly, such a scenario is highly unlikely.


Not being an expert is okay, but please try to avoid misusing technical terms. Making a metaphor is fine, but if it looks like actual technical information, somebody is bound to take it literally and become misinformed.

bitaddress.org doesn't refuse to work in browsers that do not implement `window.crypto.getRandomValues()`. In such a case, the seeding and "move your mouse for entropy" stuff are basically the only defense line. Generated keys are probably somewhat okay due to the latter. However, I still wouldn't recommend using a browser that doesn't support `window.crypto.getRandomValues()`.
Old versions (at least 2.7.2 and earlier, I believe) would generate addresses in incompatible browsers (e.g. Opera 12) even if the user didn't move their mouse. I found that troubling, but it was fixed before I got around to reporting it.

If the goal is to avoid letting ghash.io or another pool get 51% or more of the hash rate, it actually *is* relevant.
Let's say that the total hash rate is 100GH/s, ghash.io has 55GH/s and you are running a miner which makes up 5GH/s. Since you don't like them having 55% of the hash rate, you switch your miner *off*. Now the total hash rate is 95GH/s and they have 50GH/s, which corresponds to about 53%.
If what you said was true, this would be the end and you can't do anything to push them back under 51% on your own. However, if you now switch over your 5GH/s miner over to another pool, the total hash rate goes back up to 100GH/s, leaving them with 50%. The network is safe. Somewhat.

I'm pretty sure Bitpay uses SSL. As long as SSL is properly employed and you check that the certificate is valid (you can even write down the fingerprint while on a "trusted" network), you should be good. 
Basically, assume that people can hijack your unencrypted connections, no matter if you are using public wifi, your own internet connection or Tor and behave accordingly. If it doesn't use SSL, you can't really trust it. If it does use SSL and it is important, take a moment to look at the connection details and check that it isn't using it in a retarded way (e.g. RC4) and that you are getting a valid, site-specific certificate.
Of course, if you are usually behind a NAT box, using public wifi may expose your machine to other threats you usually do not encounter, so that needs to be taken care of too.

Logging is not the same as keeping state in RAM. A certain minimum amount of state is required to keep a connection open (e.g. for TCP/IP), so when you connect over a TCP connection, there's at least that one transient table entry. There are also entries in the routing/NAT table or whatever, linking your IP to your outbound connections. These are required to allow them to send you the packets sent in response to your packets.

Using a VPN through Tor will defend you against MITM from Tor exit nodes. However, it does not assure that nobody (e.g. the VPN provider) MITMs you on the way from your VPN endpoint to your destination. In a way it only makes for a bigger attack surface, unless you need the anonymity (of questionable quality if you *only* use a VPN) it provides.
VPNs are just centralized Tor without onion routing and possibly, maybe, more trustworthy exits.

Says some random guy on stackexchange. I'd rather go with what GnuPG, OpenSSH etc. are doing and the actual documentation says.
`man random` on linux: "If you are unsure about whether you should use /dev/random or /dev/urandom, then probably you want to use the latter.  As a general rule,  /dev/urandom  should  be  used  for  everything **except** **long-lived** GPG/SSL/SSH **keys**." I'm quite sure paper wallets qualify as "long-lived keys".
You can check `cipher/random.c`, `cipher/rndlinux.c` and e.g. `cipher/elgamal.c` in the GnuPG source tree. You will see that for key generation a "level 2" random bit source is used which means that `/dev/random` is used.
Edit: Of course, it's very unlikely that using `/dev/urandom` will ever lead to a real world attack against generated wallets, but why risk it?
Edit 2: I have since been [convinced]( that always using `/dev/random` may not be optimal after all. I have also found other reasonable arguments that the use of `/dev/urandom` can be sufficient, if proper care is taken to ensure data is correctly read from the device.

The type of message signing you want in this case isn't even really part of the bitcoin protocol and there is no need to send the message through the bitcoin protocol either. You just take the private key and use it to sign a message. Then you give the signature, the public key and the message to somebody and they can verify that the public key hashes to the correct address and that the signature is valid. The official client has a message signing/validation function. Others probably do too.
@_date: 2014-06-27 01:09:51
There is a JS API function provided by modern browsers, which is called `window.crypto.getRandomValues()`. This function allows the secure generation of entropy.
Today, bitaddress.org uses bits it retrieves using this API, various information about your browser, mouse movements and keyboard input to generate random numbers. If your browser does not provide the `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` API (one such browser would be Opera 12), you still get entropy from the mouse movements, because the site will not produce a key before you have moved it around for a certain amount. This means that even with an old browser, you will (likely) get reasonably secure keys.
When I looked at it, back when it was at version 2.7.2, there was a bit of an issue. If you used a browser without support for the `window.crypto.getRandomValues()` API and did not move your mouse (it only waited for a limited time back then), your only entropy came from the information it gathered about your browser, your browser's `Math.random()` function and a bunch of timestamps it collected.
It is hard to estimate exactly how much entropy this provides. An attacker could easily get the information about your browser if they got you to visit a site they control. Alternatively, they could guess at default browsers of popular Linux live DVDs. `Math.random()` only provides a low amount of entropy; that's how the brainwallet.org failure occured. However, bitaddress.org also collected a few timestamps while running. Guessing them is not completely trivial, but it may not be overly hard either.
If you used bitaddress.org back then, used a browser that [was not compatible]( with `window.crypto.getRandomValues` **and** were too lazy to move around the mouse at all, it may not be a bad idea to generate a new wallet, just in case. If any of those do not apply to you, you are probably fine.
@_date: 2014-07-09 22:09:30
I guess that works, but why add another link to the chain that can be attacked?
Besides, from how I understand it, NMC assignments need to be refreshed regularly. This means that the signed message would need to include a date of expiration, which any receivers would need to check.
I suppose one might argue that such a date should be included in a message with an address too, just in case one discontinues use of an address, but that seems like a less important scenario.

Looking at it again:


Your issue seems to be with "162.248.99.164", which resolves to "164-99-248-162-static.reverse.queryfoundry.net". This hostname contains the IP in the somewhat common reverse notation. Now, if you plug that into google, you find that entry on bitnodes.io, which lists that hostname and IP as a node in the bitcoin network. At least it was a node in the bitcoin network in Febuary, it may no longer be.
Regarding the hostname, QueryFoundry LLC is a consulting and hosting company from Australia (queryfoundry.com). "reverse" refers to the hostname being the RDNS hostname for the IP given in the first name and "static" would seem to indicate that the IP is not dynamically allocated. I would assume that one of their customers was running a DNS resolver (and bitcoin node) at some time.
Now, the specific reason that this IP was set as your DNS resolver, while also running a bitcoin node at some point in time? That's anyone's guess.

It would be difficult to switch over the whole bitcoin system to a different type of signatures, because the addresses are tied to EC public keys and, once EC is easily breakable, there is no sensible way to sign a transaction to move the coins to a new address type, because an attacker could calculate the key right when the transaction is broadcast and flood their own transaction using that key to the network.
As for quantum cryptography, I believe it will be less useful than many expect, since, to the best of my knowledge, it will always require special hardware and is mainly a key exchange mechanism.
Regular symmetric cryptography will still be secure in post-QC world, as long as the keys are long enough (256bits and up), and there are also some [asymmetric approaches]( which should be secure against quantum computers.

In that scenario, there is of course the issue of how to pay the miners for including your hash in their block. There is no full transaction at that point, so you can't include any fee. Without requiring fees, it becomes also open to abuse, since people can request the inclusion of hashes (or arbitrary data, really) and then never follow up with the actual transaction.

Don't forget that they would need to trust their own eyes to correctly image the world and their own brains to correctly model it... Really. Nobody demands perfect trust. That is not achievable anyway.
Giving anybody with the necessary skills the code so they can audit it will *increase* trust in your product. Using a deterministic build system, which allows people to verify that the code they get will produce the binary can increase trust further.
Currently, such a level of increased trust (code available) is the default for non-web wallets. It is, of course, your choice if you want to go with a scheme, which will lower people's a priori trust in your product. However, you should be aware of this. I do not believe that arguing about whether or not being closed source is that bad will increase trust in your product.
If you have a reason for keeping the source closed beyond "well, it's not that bad to be closed source and I kind of like it," you can state it and people can consider whether it makes sense or not and the specific merits of your product warrent the leap of faith necessary to make up the gap between it and others, which are open source.

But what you described is only valid for the use of credit cards, which isn't common at all here. If I pay the regular way, by sending money to the merchant's bank account, chargebacks are also pretty hard, so it's not much of a difference in risk when compared to the conventional method of payment.
It also matters less when you already know that both merchants under consideration are trustworthy.


When you asked for benefits as a merchant, you didn't bother to specify your peculiar modes of operating. I don't think most online shops behave like that. Expecting people to guess at your personal, irregular behaviour doesn't seem conducive, when asking for advice.

But GnuPG has no software updater. Nor has libssl. Or a bunch of other crypto software. I'm not sure that comparing criticisms of JS cryptography to software with silent auto-update functions hits quite the spot that critics are going for. The point is that other common crypto implementations have an "update as the exception" instead of "update as the rule" model, where updates are triggered by conscious user action. Now, one could argue that typing an address into a web browser without previously ensuring that the files will still be loaded from cache, or hitting a reload button could be considered to be such conscious user actions, but I would find that argument highly questionable.
The post also completely ignores:
*  the difficulty of avoiding side-channel vulnerabilities in JS code
* the issue of how to securely zero keys from memory
* the fact that you cannot prevent them from being swapped out with the browser
* the lack of a CPRNG API in older browsers.
It also glosses over how common XSS vulnerabilities are and what those do to JS crypto. One could say that among all the sensible enough talk about threat models, very real problems with implementing cryptography in JS go entirely ignored.
Edit: Regarding "the lack of a CPRNG API in older browsers", this is a real problem. An older version (I know that this applies to 2.7.2) of the bitaddress.org code silently used bad sources of entropy if `window.crypto.getRandomValues` wasn't available in the browser. A user who didn't take advantage of the "move your mouse for better entropy" functionality (current versions require this) may have generated less than highly secure keys. If the mouse was moved during key generation, the quality of the keys may be sufficient. I don't know.

The name of HTTPS Everywhere is a slight misnomer.

Okay, that should take care of most issues, although it would still require a good number of adjustments. Still, better than catastrophic failure. I'm not sure how not forwarding something that is part of the block would work though. From how I understand it, the blocks themself cannot be modified/pruned, only local copies of the blockchain. A full, un-pruned copy is still required for bootstrapping to preserve the trustless-ness of the system. This full copy would still have to include all those prunable hashes without followup. Besides, these hashes would still take up precious space inside the blocks and if there is a high amount of abuse or hash spam, miners may be incentivized not to include hashes so they can produce smaller blocks which are easier to get propagated.
Of course, unless these measures are implemented and ready to be switched on at the flip of a button before the first sufficiently fast QC appears, Bitcoin might just crash hard enough that miners shut down before mitigating measures are put into place.
QC resistant NIZK proofs to replace signatures would be nice. Yes.

Luckily, at least on Linux rdrand is not the only source of entropy, but only xored into the regular entropy pool. This might still be an issue if the hypothetical backdoor in rdrand is [more complex]( and peeks at the pool before delivering especially tailored results. Still, this could be defeated by running those values through a sufficiently complex key stretching function. It's unlikely that the backdoor could brute-force a few bits of scrypt without noticably increasing latency.

Obviously. If you do important things on a PC that is not trustworthy, you are doing it wrong. Trustworthy network transport is less important and a lack of trust can be mitigated by properly employed cryptography.

From their [FAQ](


My snake-oil senses are tingling.
* Who the hell uses lattice based encryption systems at this point in time? Sure, resistance against quantum computers is nice and all, but I don't think there are any very well studied and audited implementations. Even the systems themselves could probably use being studied a bit more. NTRU looks pretty nice though, but I don't really see where they would be using that.
* 4096 bit keys sound like RSA, not like NTRU or anything lattice based I know.
* A symmetric cipher with 4096 bit keys (256 * 16 = 4096)? Again with the 4096. What cipher is this? It better not be some kind of home brew cipher. Besides 256 bit keys are more than enough for symmetric ciphers. Even Grover's algorithm for quantum computers doesn't mess them up. There's not much point in going all the way up to 4096.
* It is a symmetric cipher with 4096 bit keys that takes only 23840 times longer to break than AES256? That is really, really bad.  It should take 2^3840 times longer. (Yes, I noticed, but that's still a pretty dumb mistake to make.)
I'm not even going to comment on things like "which is very easy to use with keys".

I prefer thinking about and explaining that part in a different way:
Bitcoin is based on the Blockchain, a public, global, decentralized ledger. To keep it secure, various entities provide computational power.

In the case of Tor, there are also hidden services, which work without an exit node.
The thing I am concerned here, is, how robust the anonymity was designed to be. In an NSA world, doing a bit of indirection may not be enough to guarantee anonymity, if correlating the times at which you send off packets can be correlated with the receipt of requests at other, possibly adversary, nodes in the network. Correlation attacks like that are also an issue for Tor, while GNUnet seems to have been designed with that kind of powerful adversary in mind.
In general, it's not so much about encryption as it is about how well you can hide in the crowd. Today, encryption should be taken for granted in a system like this.

In general, they can't. That is only a danger in the case of broken implementations (e.g. those using bad pseudo random number generators).

Avoiding address reuse can mitigate this danger. This is called [defense in depth]( The fact that it improves privacy is a nice bonus.

It has been specifically stated that it is not open source.

It's a device (node, which can be used like a file), not a directory. Why would they point their log files there, instead of simply disabling? It's needless complexity and a (miniscule) waste of resources. Additionally, in the rare but not utterly impossible case that the device node is deleted, it could lead to sensitive data being accidentally written to disk.
Yeah. It's a bad idea and I don't believe any sensible operator would do that instead of simply switching off the logs.
Also, saying that data which is written to /dev/null is "automatically overwritten" is, while not necessarily completely wrong, a rather odd way of putting things. It should be simply written to a buffer in memory, which is then discarded. I don't think the kernel goes out of its way to zero it straight away, but I haven't checked. It is likely to be overwritten sooner or later as the memory is reused for something else.

On a more serious note: A bitcoin private key is usually 256 bits long. For symmetric encryption, 128 bit keys are reasonably secure, so you can, in fact, reduce the amount of bits you need to remember. At least as long as you disregard Grover's algorithm.

PGP. The web of trust is a pretty cool idea. It would be nice if more people used it properly.
Sending it over multiple different less-trusted channels can provide an acceptable (up to a certain transaction size) level of assurance too.


CA's probably aren't particularly interested in stealing your funds. Granted, they might get exploited or otherwise compelled.

Also, anybody between the VPN and the destination can sniff the traffic, unless you are using HTTPS or similar. Unless the VPN's endpoint is closer than you to the server you are accessing, you will increase the number of hops that can sniff your traffic. However, if you know that your local ISP is not trustworthy it may still be a decent bet, however this should hopefully be a rare case.
The main benefits of VPNs are:
* Soft anonymization with good bandwidth. You and many other users will appear to have the same IP address, so services can't usefully correlate your activity by just that. If the VPN provider "doesn't keep logs", they probably won't tell any copyright holder who the naughty person is that downloaded the new charting song. However, a VPN isn't trustless. Even if they say they "don't keep logs", they might. For non-soft anonymity, Tor is better, but it's also much slower and banned on many more websites (thanks, CloudFlare).
* Circumventing geoblocking to access websites that only allow access from certain regions. You can use a VPN server in a different country and the website will think that you are accessing it from there. This can also enhance privacy with respect to the websites (and other services) you are accessing.
* Circumventing blocks introduced by your regular ISP.

He accidentally stole it. Apparently it's surprisingly easy to get into the wrong wallet on that wallet service providers website and he didn't notice the mismatch in addresses until after sending it to himself. At least that's how I understand the circumstances. Simply sending it back would be dangerous, because anybody else could also stumble their way into the wallet.

For those wallets, the 12 word seed is basically your "password". Anybody who has it has complete control over the coins. You yourself can use it to recover access to your balance if you ever delete your wallet/your PC or phone breaks/whatever. It's also the *only* way to recover your balance in those cases (unless you also have a backup).

If you are very serious about privacy, run a proper Monero client instead of using MyMonero. MyMonero needs your unencrypted viewkey to operate, so in theory, if Shapeshift and MyMonero were subpoenad and forced to log all transactions, you could possibly be deanonymized with a timing attack. Running a full Monero node yourself would mitigate this risk.


This part is solid. The more payments and the more spread out they are, the better. Of course waiting will incur exchange rate risk.

I have done a bit more reading on this. It's kind of hard to get a proper grasp on anything concrete about MaidSafe, for some reason. Maybe it's just me.
So far, I'm not sure I see the innovation over something like GNUnet, which also provides a generic framework for building applications on top of its P2P network (data storage, chat, IP tunneling, name resolution, etc.), unless you count the tie-in of those coin-based tokens. Rather, the vagueness of anything about MaidSafe beyond "it's decentralized, it's applications, it's a new internet, it's probably anonymous" makes me somewhat uneasy. Even the wikipedia article reads kind of... odd.
I'm sure it's a well intentioned project, but it's not communicating its qualities very clearly, whatever they may be. The article here just drowns in allegory. And then there are things like this:


What is that even supposed to mean? If the encryption is broken, obviously the data becomes usable, otherwise the user couldn't use it themselves or it's not broken after all. Besides, strong encryption is not exactly a hard problem. Actually, let's keep going:


Okay, sure, a flaw may be found in AES some time. Attacks only get better, so for long term security, it's a good idea to choose a cipher with conservative safety margins. So, that's...


...what. Are they throwing away proven cryptography to make their own stream(?) cipher and calling it a "one time pad"? I sure hope this is a misrepresentation of the project, because it makes my snake oil alarm go all beepy.


Okay, maybe I was a bit too quick? Are they doing homomorphic encryption? That's... kind of weird and possibly cool, but it's also a quite cutting edge, which isn't a good thing in the realm of cryptography. Personally, I would caution against using it in a production system at this point...
I'd better stop here, this is getting kind of stream of consciousness. Overall, my point is that there is something here and I'm not sure what it is. It's kind of interesting, but the way it is communicated makes it seem like a grand big mess of concepts that are vaguely connected, without a clear red thread. That either indicates bad communcation or a jumbled concept that sounds smarter than it is. I couldn't say which is the case here.
PS: One more thing. What.

Apologies for asking a lazy question, but how would you classify the level of anonymity in comparison to the level provided by Tor, Freenet and GNUnet with a high anonymity setting?

Addresses are not public keys. There are two different types of addresses. Those starting with '1', which are hashes of public keys, and those starting with '3', which are [P2SH]( addresses. Multisig addresses are always P2SH. directory.io only generates public/private key pairs, so it only lists addresses starting with '1' and hence no multisig addresses.
@_date: 2015-05-04 12:48:56
Yes. Never post your secret 12 word long seed anywhere. Post your public address instead. That's safe. :)
A public Bitcoin address looks like this: `1PC9aZC4hNX2rmmrt7uHTfYAS3hRbph4UN`
In comparison, a secret 12 word seed would look like this kind of thing: `like just love know never want time out there make look eye`
So you really can't accidentally mix them up, because they look completely different.

Why does this comment have a negative score? From how I read it, he's right.
The "key" in question is a subkey with an invalid self signature. As a matter of fact, its self signature is an exact copy of the main key. Somebody tinkered with the key, added a subkey with a really low factor (easy to find) and copied the self signature packet from a different subkey. This now syntactically valid, but cryptographically invalid construct was then uploaded to a keyserver for whatever reason.
No PGP implementation will actually use this bad key, because it has an invalid self signature. It wasn't a key that was accidentally generated badly, so no worries about broken key generators. Breaking 4096bit keys is no easier than thought, this key just had a very low factor that wouldn't appear in any proper keys.

The point in question would be then, how this retains value.


This is a valid point. In this case, you should probably go a bit further though, since elsewhere in the thread you have mentioned that somebody could still get what is pretty much the source, even though it is not in your intention to allow this. As it currently appears to be, only those with an adversarial mind set will get the source, while those would seem to be the ones you would not wish to have it. Maybe add some obfuscation?


I'm not sure I like this part. It reads like a veiled accusation of misanthropy towards those who would prefer your product to be more transparent, making it easier to trust and recommend.

Evaluating VPNs is nice and all and they are useful tools for certain things, but people shouldn't rely on them for anything really important as far as privacy is concerned.
Slightly edited [repost]( of something I wrote on this before:


Also, anybody between the VPN and the destination can sniff the traffic, unless you are using HTTPS or similar. Unless the VPN's endpoint is closer than you to the server you are accessing, you will increase the number of hops that can sniff your traffic. However, if you know that your local ISP is not trustworthy it may still be a decent bet, however this should hopefully be a rare case.
The main benefits of VPNs (in this sense) are:
* Soft anonymization with good bandwidth. You and many other users will appear to have the same IP address, so services can't usefully correlate your activity by just that. If the VPN provider "doesn't keep logs", they probably won't tell any copyright holder who the naughty person is that downloaded the new charting song. However, a VPN isn't trustless. Even if they say they "don't keep logs", they might. For non-soft anonymity Tor is better, but it's also much slower and banned on many more websites (thanks, CloudFlare).
* Circumventing geoblocking to access websites that only allow access from certain regions. You can use a VPN server in a different country and the website will think that you are accessing it from there. This can also enhance privacy with respect to the websites (and other services) you are accessing.
* Circumventing blocks introduced by your regular ISP with good speed.
@_date: 2015-05-17 01:46:56
If you are doing something that will have a government coming after you, not just, let's say cyber criminals or copyright holders, you really want to be using Tor (or I2P, if applicant), not a VPN.

If you connect to Tor nodes, nobody but your peer will see that you are using Bitcoin through Tor, so I don't see how that might raise or lower your profile. However, you could just as well sign your transactions offline and then submit them by means of a browser if that's your kind of thing.

VPNs aren't trustless. Depending on your threat scenario 1) a VPN might be enough 2) you might be better off not using a VPN and connecting directly(*) 3) you might need Tor.

Speaking of change and privacy, I use coin control and there is one thing that would make my life a lot easier while helping me to keep things straight. Right now, change simply gets the label "(change)", so I usually have to generate a new receive address with a label relating it to the label I used for the source address (e.g. "change from Humble Bundle tx") and use that as a custom change address. In the beginning I didn't do that, so when I look at one of those old change addresses, I need to hunt through my transactions to find out where it came from. Getting more informative labels automatically would help a lot.

The [self authentication]( section has some odd bits, e.g.:




That's not how salts work. You still only have to attack `H(K + S(K, W))`, which depends only on K and W, with this construction.
Splitting the authentication information into a "keyword" and a "password" is also a little odd.


It's "Function" not "File".
The description of the defense against password guessing is also less than clear.
On [safecoins](
It is said that double spending is avoided by having "Transaction Managers" confirm the validity of the transactions, but it is nowhere explained how these "Transaction Managers" are chosen.
On one hand, if Transaction Managers are something like close group members (analogous to Client Manager, Node Manager etc.):
Since only a unique coin ID, the previous only and the current owner are known, it seems possible to me that two or three colluding users (or one with multiple identities) and one or more (?) Transaction Managers could easily collude to make up new coins from nothing.
On the other hand, if there is a set of global Transaction Managers and that role is hard to get and that all transactions must go through, safecoins would be hardly anonymous or "like cash", as the Transaction Managers could simply keep track of all transactions.
If there is some mechanism to prevent both of those scenarios, it is not (well) described.

Running it manually would be too much effort, but if you can code or can write it down for someone who can, you won't be without encryption, even if the knowledge suddenly becomes otherwise inaccessible.

Terrible idea in my opinion.
* You would train people to install random apps they are linked to.
* You would have to send them the private key or something equivalent. This means that you or the service you use could take back the coins later, unless the wallet automatically swipes them to a new address.
* In a world where few people are using PGP, it would be hard to make sure the private key reaches them without compromise. You don't want to send around unencrypted private keys, really.
Of course, if you don't care about security, only use it for toy amounts and people already install whatever apps they come across anyway, I suppose it's okay.

I'd appreciate that.
Edit: [This]( page claims it would be too hard to find IDs that are close to a specific ID due to the use of SHA512. This seems false to me. An attacker does not have to approximate the hash of target ID. It should be sufficient to get closer to it than any other members of the network, so the difficulty would just scale with the number of network participants.

(One might start arguing about the relative security of `/dev/random` and `/dev/urandom`. I am of the opinion that `/dev/urandom` is [just fine]( but arbitrarily picked `/dev/random` here.)

Depends on:
1) How likely do you consider the existence of quantum computers now or in the near future?
2) Do you think a quantum computer will be able to break your private ECC key before your transaction is confirmed and will be able to double spend it?
If your answers are "likely, probably" then you should be concerned. Otherwise not so much.

Remine the whole chain, divert the coinbase transactions that would have later on lead to the address you want to rob. The coins will never have gotten there to begin with.

They use scrypt with somewhat decently sized parameters and PBKDF2/HMAC-SHA256 which is also part of scrypt. It's pretty much the correct way of doing brainwallets. Personally, I'd pick something even slower though.

But that's backwards. Right now, the supply of coins in circulation is still increasing. This means that Bitcoin currently still undergoes inflation of supply. Once the subsidy stops and the supply only changes due to coins being lost it will become deflationary, definitely not "inflationary/deflationary".

People might argue that this is not a problem on Bitcoin's side. Chainanalysis however... It's pretty hard to use Bitcoin in a privacy preserving way. The least you have to do is use coin control, but somehow I doubt many people are using that.

Also, and probably even worse: If you send 0.9 BTC instead of 1 in this situation, it will be easy to infer which is the receiving address and which is the change address, because you wouldn't use both outputs to send 0.1 BTC somewhere.
You can have lots of fun with analysis like this. Throw in some stochastic methods and widely known addresses and things become, probabilistically, even clearer.

It's iffy to say the least. To the best of my knowledge, "hacking back" as self defense has never been tested in court. According to some [legal theories]( (there may be more) it may be permissible, under certain circumstances, to help blocking an attacker. In this case, there was no ongoing attack anymore and hacking the hacker's email account wouldn't have been an effective measure at stopping those attacks in any way.
Instead the hacking was done to gather evidence to use against him. That is what usually falls under the purview of police work. Analogous: You can't legally break into a suspected thief's house to check if your property is in there. That's not legal self defense. You get police to do it for you, with a warrant.

The contents of the warning is still wrong or at best misleading. It also says "BitCoin", not "Bitcoin Miner". If you get infected by malware that deploys a miner and you end up being shown that message, you just might get kind of the wrong impression. The fact that a non-technical user wouldn't run a miner themselves doesn't really make it better.

@_date: 2015-09-09 12:50:37
That's not how it works.
There are in general two kinds cryptography.
Symmetric cryptography is the kind where you have only a secret key. Everyone with the secret key can encrypt and decrypt the data. AES and Blowfish are two algorithms of this type. This kind of cryptography is mostly secure against quantum computers. They at best can effectively halve the key size. Since, today, for a proper symmetric cipher a key with a length of 128 bit is considered secure, in a world with quantum computers 256 bit keys should be fine. Most popular symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES, already support or have variants with 256 bit keys.
The second is asymmetric cryptography. You have key pairs with a public and a private key. It is used for encryption, decryption and commonly signing messages. Examples of algorithms making use of this kind of cryptography are RSA, ElGamal and the elliptic curve types that are used in most cryptocurrencies. For the first two, secure key sizes are on the order of 2048 bits to 4096 bits. For ECC you are good at about 256 bits. All those three are also easily broken by quantum computers. Just increasing the key size won't save you, it will only make things slower for you without doing much for the quantum computer.
However, there are already algorithms that do asymmetric crypto things and are resistant to quantum computers. They are slower, use bigger keys (although that is not the point) and introduce more overhead for messages. That is the reason these algorithms aren't widely used today, but we have them and can improve them so we are ready for the future where we need them.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:11:04
I'd go even further and say that the Snowden leaks indicate that, at least at that time, they didn't have a practical quantum computer. Otherwise all those things they had trouble with (e.g. Tor) would have been easy.

Depends on the quality of your paper and ink (toner?). If the paper self destructs after a few years or your ink fades quickly, you'll want to copy them every once in a while. Store them in a way that is not overly harmful to paper. Encrypting them is a good idea if you are sure you will still now the key in a few years.

It may not be perfect, but it's the best we have. At the time Snowden grabbed his data the NSA was unhappy about how well it works.
Before anybody asks, regarding the "best we have" bit: Yes, there's also I2P, but that one is different in that it doesn't allow connections to the regular internet. I'm not saying that is bad thing, but my statement is intended to specifically apply to things that do what Tor does, not similar but different systems.
@_date: 2015-03-23 14:34:53
A few suggestions:
* Use coin control.
* Don't use change, unless it is from a transaction to the entity you are paying now too, and they can already connect the payments anyway, because it's going to the same account or something. Even then you might want to avoid it.
* In all other cases, mix *and* coinjoin any coins you receive (even as change).
* When mixing, draw it out over a long time frame and ensure that you do not receive the whole sum at once or in the same final address.
Or use a CryptoNote coin like Monero (as an intermediary). You might still want to send coins of each denomination to yourself, slowly, with a high mixin, to avoid a certain type of probabilistic analysis.

Nobody seriously claimed it has anything to do with MITM. Well, I supposed you could say that Cloudflare is a kind of MITM itself, but that's neither here nor there.
It has to do with Tor in so far as most Tor exit nodes are flagged as up to no good in Cloudflare and such provoke captchas on sites that have set Cloudflare to block "evil" clients. For some services, blocking Tor users might actually be desirable from the point of view of the provider.
If those sites just set up a hidden service, the problem would go away.

Yes, that is what I was saying.
aaronvoisine said the captcha prevents people from being mitmed. If they were being mitmed, they'd never even see the captcha because the exit node obviously wouldn't have Cloudflare protection in place on the website it delivers to the user. The user wouldn't get stuck on the captcha and thus get robbed by the mitming attacker, according to his scenario. Therefore the captcha doesn't protect the user.
And yes, I know it was supposed to be a joke.

Just copying the wallet.dat should be fine. Being out of date doesn't matter. Once you copy/download/sync the blockchain you're good.
As for burning it on a CD, best make sure it's encrypted with a secure passphrase before you do. You might also make a second copy in case the CD ends up unreadable, although that might or might not be overkill for 0.20 BTC.

Would you mind explaining in more detail what you're talking about? My Japanese is decent and I'm not seeing your point. You even cut off half the words in the second bit, so either those are pretty well hidden puns or you are making stuff up.
To give some context:
* "[ダン・]リー氏は" is basically "Mr. [Dan] Lee [...]"
* "[す]ぐ換金出[来る]" is "[You can] turn it into money [right away] [...]"
The hole sentence means:
Dan Lee, the owner of the New York general store "Green Ave Market", which accepts Bitcoin payments, explained his reason for accepting them as follows: "It's easier than credit cards. You can turn it into money right away, so there isn't even any risk."
...Wait. Were you making a "what are these symbols, you should know I can't read them and yet you posted them, so here's a pretend reaction" joke? If so, my apologies. It went straight over my head.
