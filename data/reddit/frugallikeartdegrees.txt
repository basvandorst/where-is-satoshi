I dont think the blockchain is going to be maintained
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:13:40
This has worked well for me... tbh....
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:20:00
I'm currently using it. 
I hate USD.
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:37:40
Or Ethereum. Ethereum is actually used on exchanges.
I feel like this problem is already solved.

Any 2 year span has shown bitcoin is good for holding value. If you bought at the top of an All-Time-High, You aren't allowed to complain.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:39:35
Crypto noobs don't understand the Value behind Bitcoin. 
They put their money in pyramid scheme ICOs and hyped up alt-coins that you can't even store on an Android phone.
If Bitcoin gets a working LN.... are we talking beyond Moon?

After being in crypto for years, IOTA is probably hyping up a partnership with microsoft. 
Microsoft is probably too big to squelch a random program going within the company. (not to mention IOTA has been profitable)
These are probably alt-coin hype, seen it before. Stick to coins that actually solve problems, not just ones with Marketing budgets.

Just moved 1.1 btc to Jaxx. I know its a hot wallet, but whatever.
Diversified my risk a bit

Not exactly sure since it was 1.5 years ago. But there was definitely a financial event in South Korea that saw the rise of bitcoin from 600 to 1200. Was almost positive it was printing more money.
Anyone know?
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:41:35
Do other people believe this sillyness?
@_date: 2018-01-14 20:35:43
I guess?
Bitcoin is different that its the only 'rare' crypto. Its held value for 9 years and is a hedge against fiat currency. I dont think even 300$ fees will stop bitcoin's value.
Alt coins are great for moving money. There are 1000 coins that can do this.
The only problem is that alt-coin mania is currently ongoing and we have to go through a painful pump and dump wakeup call. People are vastly over-estimating uses for blockchain, which is just a public verfication system. 
I see 3 currencies in the future, Bitcoin, Ethereum/litecoin/whatever money transfer coin, and Monero(for privacy)
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:26:23
Not rarity. LTC isn't scarce like bitcoin.
Bitcoin is digital gold.
If you want a crypto that can be moved with minimal fees, there are literally 1000 to choose from.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:17:05
Bitcoin is rare. 
Everything else is a copy-alt coin. 
Bitcoin will forever be the only rare crypto.

Hot Girl is pumping up her alt-coin. Possibly paid upvotes/comments?
Reddit Advertisement.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:24:29
Ethereum is the crypto used on everything in 2018.
B2B isnt there yet, but neither is literally any other.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:13:46
If your government disables the internet. 
I think we would have a violent revolution here if that happened.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:53:07
I hear this, but coinbase has kept my wife's BTC safe since 2011. 
I'm also not as interested in Cold Storage due to the house/location I live in. 
They also did give me my shitcoin cash which I sold at $4,000. Circle Pay fucked me by getting depreciated. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:40:55


Yes, and usually your value has grown 1,000%
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:12:02
I'm ready to move onto an Ethereum solution or Monero for payments.
Bitcoin is fantastic at holding value. If a warlord invaded your capital city, you are better off having bitcoin than whatever piece of paper your last government issued. South Korea trusted bitcoin during a period of inflation in 2016 which saw the price rise from 600-800+ 
Bitcoin is the original and safest to store value.
 Other coins will solve finance problems.
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:19:47
I'm guessing that most people dont want their personal info public.
Saw some BS about medical records being in the blockchain.
I like it, but this is alt coin mania.
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:03:47
Companies dont have control over themselves. If someone at FB thinks they should start their own coin, FB will start their own coin. 
This is literally why coporations are weird, lots of humans. 
He does have quite a bit of power. At my company, when the CEO tells us to 'start each meeting on time', the company makes a real effort to do that. Not everywhere, but it works its way into the culture. Leadership is exactly that. Words do have power.

I sold 3 shitcoin at $4,000. The FUD when you talk to a BCH supporter is insane. They go a bit kook
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:15:55


The word PinkCoin is seen on the frontpage of Bitcoin.

As long as you aren't buying at all-time highs, you should be good.
@_date: 2018-01-13 13:25:18
Scaling is insanely difficult for any business.
Heck, look at Tesla. They cant even make 100,000 vehicles, let alone the 7,000,000 vehicles/year that is expected for their market cap.
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:22:42
Idk man, is it better to keep a flash drive of bitcoin in my closet? My friends know i have bitcoin.
At least coinbase has 2 step. 
Also, homes do catch fire. Cold storage has downfalls.
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:31:52
This is why Bitcoin.
With 300 dollar transaction fees, Bitcoin is still rare. 
I like Ethereum, and Monero, but they are abundent Alt-coins. They fix problems, but they arent rare like bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:00:37
I think the future is going to be a heavy bitcoin that is ALWAYS valued and not volatile due to it having 9 years of establishing positive value. A very boring rise to ~100k, but a safe hedge against government hyperinflation.
Then currencies like Ether and Monero serve purposes to transfer money and smart contracts.
The rest of the madness with billion dollar alt-coins is... unsettling. Blockchain has limited uses outside moving money cheaply. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 00:01:20
I'm a programmer and I'm wondering how hard it would be to make 4 billion more entries for 'bitcoin' in their database.
Functionally they need a warehouse, but the programming would be telling people they are exchanging bitcoin between friends on facebook.
No private keys unfortuantly, but as long as they can hold it, would be worldchanging development in bitcoin. Everyone having access + no more fees(FB to FB).
It solves problems and I think everyone can agree this would be a fun thought. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:49:26
Fuck Coinbase.
Am I doing this right?
@_date: 2018-01-14 17:44:05
Testing needs to be done. I cannot emphasize enough how important getting testing is. This isnt Bitcoin, this is running a program outside of Bitcoin and essentially shuffles Bitcoin around.
Bitcoin has been perfect for transactions for 9 years. LN needs to prove themselves.
After that, I only imagine quite quickly. Reduction of fees mean that  people can 'charge more fees for themselves'. Everyone wins.
@_date: 2018-01-07 22:04:04
Its that if you HODL you will be okay.
If your country/fiat currency undergoes massive hyperinflation, you can HODL with bitcoin.
