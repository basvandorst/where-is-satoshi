You're very idealistic about this. Being good or bad is unrelated to money.

There's a hundred different digital currencies running. But yes,  btc is the largest since long. And corruption or no corruption might not be decided based upon being deflationary

While this is all nice and good, don't forget that good and evil people own cash and same way with btc.
What today seems like a good deed is tomorrow's evil in the hands of a new aristocratic class, if they turn corrupt.
And wisdom tells, power corrupts. The first few thousands who got bitcoin are now powerful. Their sons will hold much power. And turn corrupt in many cases.
And the cycle repeats.
Just some two cents. There's no ultimate solution

What is a phoney transaction? Do you know that only utxos can be spent and only by the owner of the private key to that address? You cannot generate bitcoins to back your phoney transactions. The only thing that a 51% attack can do is double spend. Without 51 percent no validated block of you will pass among the honest nodes. How do you intend to add fake transactions for coins that you do not own or know the key for?
What you're describing is a fool scenario, no system will be put into place that works like you describe. It's pure garbage engineering no sane person would use

@_date: 2019-04-03 05:49:48
I agree with your arguments, but still whales are everywhere. BTC is very illiquid compared to the money that moves it, so even more swings. This one was sleeping there tho for 3 months of lullying and slow accumulation, and a strong move was due. Market makers, liquidated shorts and hungry bots as usual.

On one lightning network node. It's just the beginning, it is going to catalyze the adoption.
Look up bch value if that makes more sense to you.
Concern troll much?
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:13:59
Let's see:
A: You say, it's a simple validation of one transaction that is consuming energy. This is not totally correct. 
Although it's indeed validating transactions (actually a series of them in one block), but the energy is not about validation. It's about competing in the system for being first in resolving a computation, to assure that the financial needs (energy) to validate blocks is high enough to prevent attacks on the whole system.
So it's clearly an energy consumption as a whole system, not a single transaction, and is the price of maintaining a global public ledger that can be used by anyone without permission.
So isn't this much more than just a simple validation of one transaction.  It's the cost of something much more evolutionary in the finance, removing the middleman from the equation.
The original whitepaper of Bitcoin lays it out much nicer the issue at hand.
B: energy consumption of traditional banking, and trust you put in banking institutions, payment validators all around the globe.
Yes, think about how much that whole "traditional" system globally eats up as energy. All the buildings, all the payrolls, all the people's food consumption at the banks and institutions and fintech. All the energy needed to maintain the banking and fintech infrastructure built around it 24/7. Servers in cloud, servers in banks, and disaster recovery sites...
I haven't done the research for B, but it certainly is much more than the single cost of one validation of traditional systems if we add all the other additional consumption in the system.
But point A. I think it's clear that the statement "energy used to validate one transaction" is just a portion of the picture. (And I'm aware of other pos and dpos solutions that might cost less, but that's another theoretical debate, which is far from clear outcome, taking into consideration the cartelization of PoS systems and the problem of inflation in a pos system that comes from the all internalized nature of PoS, versus PoW where the validation comes from external entity with energy costs that adds to the system's "energy level" on a constant basis)

@_date: 2019-01-14 22:40:40
But one of the most important might see an issue in the coming years 
@_date: 2019-01-31 07:53:24
You make it sound simple as that. But it's clearly much more than that. It takes much more energy to keep the global conservative Fiat  currencies going validated and in a trusted system, constantly modified by external parties called different banking institutions.
 Bitcoin spares that and not just that, does that without Central authorization. That's not simple validation of one transaction. It's maintaining a secure public ledger on a global level.
Without that it's doesn't work as a whole
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:10:00
Nope.  You just need a lightning enabled wallet.
This is for people who want to participate in the actual lightning network as liquidity providers

@_date: 2019-01-25 21:17:16
Who cares. Just buy more crypto to replace.
@_date: 2018-11-24 14:20:59
Nope, it's about scarcity, if the coins are lost without key.
Smart pants in action, that's me 8-)
@_date: 2019-01-23 19:29:59
But, you need that key on btc blockchain to transfer.
You hand it over to a bank, effectively they can block serving your tendered btc by simply denying your transfer initiation in the wallet they'll provide.
If they use address derivation they might even hide the fact that they don't even hold your tendered btc.
Effectively this has very much the potential to be like a database in an exchange where you could lose it all in case of bankruptcy or scandal.
@_date: 2018-11-13 23:06:31
Great image with great message and fine craft. 
How much time it took to create this one, if you have the information, and if I may ask?
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:08:11
You could try to use usd currency for volume, to see how much fiat was involved. That gives an interesting perspective. A lot of new fiat looking for storing value could be another potential.
@_date: 2019-01-31 08:55:57
" Instead, people should argue WHY that energy consumption is justified. At least that position is not lost by default."
That's exactly what I tried to outline, why  "it is entirely a simple validation" is not standing. The WHY is the reason of the whole build up of the system of bitcoin and its energy costs. Without the WHY it's all meaningless. With it, it is a possible evolutionary step in many areas, firstly financial, and up to debate: philosophical, ethical, political.
I'm well aware of loaning and other parts of banking and many other areas of it. Still thinking that a simple transaction validation doesn't have a high energy cost distributed around the globe as a whole in the many forms of energy requirements of a traditional financial system is saying there's nothing stacked up on top of a simple thing as "processing a transaction" in the traditional way.
What you find stacked up in bitcoin, you don't see as stacked up in traditional banking. It's a double standard issue in thinking.
@_date: 2019-01-25 21:16:10
Why? You just have to replace the spent coins.
Keep buying, spend and hold too. Let the adoption grow

@_date: 2019-01-23 19:35:28
Simply, you need that key on btc blockchain to transfer for a reason.
First level:
You hand it over to a bank, effectively they can block serving your tendered btc by simply denying your transfer initiation in the wallet they'll provide.
Second level:
they use address derivation and for technical reasons they will join the held btc in a common deposit, reserve, then they might even hide the fact that they don't even hold your tendered btc if the wallet just shows a balance like on an exchange... Then fractional reserve it like gold earlier...
Effectively this has very much the potential to be like a database in an exchange where you could lose it all in case of bankruptcy or scandal or simply denying your funds.

@_date: 2018-12-05 21:24:58
How do you suppose to have it used globally if it's value isn't doing what it does, with a fixed number of supply?
The price fluctuation is coded into the very idea, that you might have not understood when you first got into it.
It's mathematically impossible to avoid the burns with a newly created limited supply asset,  till everyone gets it globally. 
This, related to your edit. Just my two cents

Yeah, I'm just smiling looking at the tsla stocks small bumps last months in my portfolio... It's just smooth compared to this
@_date: 2018-12-04 20:59:57
But that's fine, I understand your thought process. 
But to look at it, as a global currency, it's natural that it will get through a few phases of under and overvaluation before stabilizing...
My thought is, that it needs to become adopted. And that comes with this type of wild rides. I'm here to bet on that, and I'm fine to lose as well. 
So I'm using it to transact if possible, and buy and hold to keep the non political idea alive and grow.
Yes, that's pyramid. Adoption is a growing net, and that can be seen as pyramid.
