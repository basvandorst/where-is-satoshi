Bitcoin is one of the most powerful and secure networks in the world. For the first time in human history, anyone from any walk of life, any age, gender or creed can send value to anyone else in the world without a middle man. Bitcoin is financial and contractual truth. You sir, sound like an ignorant fool. Have you ever created anything in your life? Have you ever worked on a project that could possibly change the world? No, because you're a human of average intelligence, with no ambition beyond shoving processed foods down your fat gullet.

Thank you for addressing this. My biggest beef with bitcoin enthusiasts is that they're pushing bitcoin to technology-illiterate individuals with no concerns for their safety. Bitcoin may be secure itself, but end-user mistakes are very, verrry common (I started r/SorryForYourLoss few days ago to show these examples). I've seen a lot of people here lose money because they don't know how to use and secure bitcoin properly, and the responses they get are the usual "It's you're fault for not knowing X and Y"

That's not my point. This landlord obviously doesn't know enough about Bitcoin to even ask the correct question. It's not "Can bitcoin be hacked?", it's "Will my bitcoins be secure using my current computer setup and knowledge?" 
Yeah, brute forcing private keys is nearly impossible, but there are still several methods to steal bitcoins by attacking the tech-illiterate end-users. This [phishing email]( looks obviously fake for the usual user, but not for people who don't know what "phishing" even means.

Bitcoin is one of the most powerful and secure networks in the world. For the first time in human history, anyone from any walk of life, any age, gender or creed can send value to anyone else in the world without a middle man. Bitcoin is financial and contractual truth. You sir, sound like an ignorant fool. Have you ever created anything in your life? Have you ever worked on a project that could possibly change the world? No, because you're a human of average intelligence, with no ambition beyond shoving processed foods down your fat gullet.

The thing is, for most people, controlling your money isn't really an issue. Most people will still give a way their control and trust financial institutions to secure their money. Even bitcoin users are using coinbase for that.  
As much as bitcoin enthusiasts would like to people to believe, bitcoin is difficult to secure for most people, especially those with no computer background. This point gets left out when pitching bitcoin to new people. These new people get into bitcoin thinking their ["money is secured by the laws of the universe"]( where in reality, a simple phishing email could empty their wallets. 
I think Bitcoin believers would not advertise bitcoin relentlessly if they didn't have financial and political incentives to do so.

People have different tastes and preferences. 
Also, users are not just "doing their thing", Some of them go out and [preach their agenda to other subreddits]( vandalize bitcoin wikipedia page, and witch-hunt people and companies they think are scamming them (theymos, Garza, .. etc).

I always had the impression that most of them have been into bitcoin for a while and then gave up on it for a reason or the other. I do believe most buttcoiner (not all) just go there to point at the crazy shit bitcoiners say and have a good laugh at their expense. It's a satire subreddit after all. We don't give out biased financial advice nor sell people on a technology we're invested in. I don't see any harm with that.
Correcting technical misconceptions about bitcoin is totally fine. It's when people start ranting about bitcoin "anti-fragility" and how it would destroy fiat and governments that I'll sit back and have a good chuckle.

Never invest more than you can afford to lose.
Also, never ever trust an online wallet or exchange.
If you do not control the private key, you do not control your investment.
Make sure you follow the 83 step plan on setting up your cold wallet storage, and don't forget to epoxy your ethernet ports shut.
