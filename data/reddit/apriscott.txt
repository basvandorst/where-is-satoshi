Germany will be the last to get Bitcoin, we just got apple pay this year and I still get looks for using debit cards for small purchases
@_date: 2019-10-24 13:48:27
What use case does Bitcoin have? Except being rare, the intrisic value of Bitcoin doesn't sustain Bitcoin's price at all, never has
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:59:17
Not anti, just VERY cautious. Germany doesn't accept something new as standard until it's been tested, vetted, studied and approved seven times over

Ok but given all the comparisons above what makes everyone think Bitcoin is somehow worth 10x+ more than it is now but gold is at the right value if not overvalued? Don't you see that what you said about gold is identical to what should be said about Bitcoin? I guess it's difficult to objectively look at something when people have their Bitcoins spent in their minds already at 100k

Anti-vaxx logic at its finest. Discredit people who have incredible depth of knowledge on a topic, because a guy on twitter came up with a factually hazy "roast"
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:32:13
I always think it's funny when people compare Bitcoin to gold because gold actually has use cases, and never skyrocketed to 100k an ounce and never will.
I don't understand why people think it's a bad thing for Bitcoin to stabilize where it is. That's a GOOD thing for using it as an actual means of conducting business and making purchases, which was kind of the whole point in the first place. But of course, personal greed outweighs the idea of seeing the Bitcoin mission through which is so incredibly ironic it hurts
@_date: 2019-08-29 16:24:04
Wow thank you so much
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:33:27
Ah yes. The classic random guy with a blog vs nobel economist on the viability of a currency. Interesting times we live in
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:35:48
What? It is, by definition, a stablecoin. Perhaps not a "stable" "coin", but is a stablecoin in every sense of the word.

It's called knowledge transfer, the idea that the underlying themes of two separate problems/ideas are actually exactly related.
I.e. people rip on anti-vaxxers, but apply identical thought processes to something else and decide its justifiable. I figured I'd try to make the (warranted) comparison but I guess it was too much.
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:45:21
Sure, but the market cap for the US dollar is 7 trillion, bitcoin is 140 billion. Not quite the same scale. On top of that, we don't know how much of bitcoin is used for illegal activity, which pretty much proves the point as to why it's an incredibly useful tool for moving illicit money around.

They can't just "print more". They only mint and rescind tokens when someone buys them or sells them. It's not a reserve in the sense that it follows any sort of monetary policy.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:23:40
Why would it only be on Facebook's platform? All the other companies backing it directly have incentive to use it and be a part of it....it's not even primarily owned by Facebook.
The real lol here is people say Bitcoin is the currency of the future, but then comments like this talk about how Bitcoin is attractive because of its speculation. That's dumb. Currencies cannot be speculative assets in a stable economy. Period. And if it doesn't have value as a means of value exchange, then what is its value?
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:54:14
Initially yes. Also in the white paper, it details plans to decentralize it over time to interested stake holders. If 1000+ different entities around the world own stake, it can't be shut down either.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:21:12
Yeah seriously. 100% of this isn't horrible, a lot of it makes sense. Agree or disagree though, shouting that its a zuckcoin tied to your facebook and facebook is tracking your purchases is idiotic
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:05:46
Since when is % of market cap relative?
Also, the fact that criminal organizations need to launder USD but not BTC should be enough
@_date: 2019-06-18 12:59:51
Haha yeah, just like the lie that Bitcoin is viable as the world's currency at its theoretical max 7 transactions per second.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:19:34
How is it not a stable coin? It's literally backed by an array of assets. Sure, it'll fluctuate, but with the underlying assets, not by market influences...any stable coin fluctuates with what's backing it.
@_date: 2019-06-19 15:26:02
It's not a custodial wallet, and also, the interest isn't used by the founding members. That isn't stated anywhere. They invest it to earn interest on the underlying capital, and the interest is used as the budget for developing the platform further. It's actually quite smart, and no one is getting "scammed".
If you have a billion dollars, and you invest and earn an avg of 7%, that gives you an operating budget of 70 million a year - which keeps the entire system basically free to use.
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:30:13
yeah why bother asking a highly qualified academic so dumb
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:00:19
True, but I don't think they're focusing on *all* altcoins, just ones which compete directly. Also, it isn't speaking of security when comparing the $10 and $20, but rather intrinsic value. The value of those two individual bills is intrinsically 0, which is the same as comparing some altcoins with Bitcoin - both are intrinsically 0.
Secondly, yes Bitcoin's price did rise with altcoins, but this isn't attributable to anything other than a general rise (or, in this case, attention) in the industry. Your comparison is flawed as external forces moved the entire market, irrespective of individual coin qualifications or merits. 
STL Fed is merely stating that all else equal competitors which offer an intrinsically equal value proposition are a threat.
@_date: 2019-01-05 21:55:19
Also not true. The assets could be moved into an account that no one has access to (including the third party). Smart contracts can be written upon acquisition of stablecoin to approve a transaction from that account in event A or event B.
Also, how could the government seize something (stablecoin) from you when wallet addresses are anonymous? Just like Bitcoin, you don't need to use an exchange.
Pretty much the market cap of Bitcoin is and never will be large enough to escape its "security" category (rather than currency), rendering it useless as an everyday currency (must be stable). This is a pretty good case study for why things like the Fed are necessary for stability

You mean peer to peer monopoly cash

This. Debt gets a really bad rap, but is one of the best/cheapest ways to finance new operations/businesses. Even in a world where Bitcoin is the only currency, we'd still need debt to fund advancement.
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:09:26
Nah, this is right. Understanding the underlying technology behind bitcoin does not equate to understanding how it can be used in a global economy. Bitcoin's infrastructure is practically immutable, and is not built to handle frequent transactions (ie could never be used as a payment system).
It's a good first step in the right direction but an unbacked fiat currency isn't the answer.
@_date: 2019-01-15 13:52:37
This article sounds pretty accurate and realistic to me
@_date: 2019-01-04 10:05:30
Not at all true. This concept is encompassed entirely by stablecoins. Stablecoins are backed by or tied to some asset - most commonly other crypto, but in the future can be any asset that has been tokenized.
Usually the asset you give up is held in a smart contract (ie I give one tokenized USD for one unit of stable coin). Good example is Dai, which I believe is collateralized by crypto or USD. It's not perfect, but a good step in the right direction.

Interested in taking a crack (pun intended) at it
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:08:34
Makes sense! So then the total value of my wallet would be what the ledger says + all existing balances in channels?
@_date: 2019-05-23 08:46:47
Channels remain open until closed correct? So if we get to the point where you don't need to open channels for a transaction (because existing channels you have end up connecting to your targeted transaction recipient in one way or another), then there would be a lot of transactions that weren't made with a ledger transaction happening over channels.
If a transaction is purely open channel -&gt; transact -&gt; close channel, it's no different than executing an existing transaction....so by leaving them open, yes it makes things faster....but then the ledger (the whole point of blockchain) becomes unaware of a lot of transactions occuring
@_date: 2019-05-23 08:34:03
Ah, somehow I missed that part. That works, I guess the after large channel network is still unclear
@_date: 2019-05-23 09:12:19


Thank you, this makes sense now.
So say I want to do a transaction for 50BTC. It won't go in the lightning network, because it's not deemed small enough. Now say my wallet has 30 BTC in it, but I have open channels with a number of people amounting to 30BTC. Do I need to close those channels before triggering my transaction, settle enough to cover the 50BTC, and then go for it? Or would something like that be automatic?
@_date: 2019-05-23 08:14:36
But how does Twitter actually help? I don't plan on buying anything on Twitter or through Twitter in any way.
