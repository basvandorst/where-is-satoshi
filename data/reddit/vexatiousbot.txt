Why the hell did this get 96 downvotes. this sub sometimes.

I think my question is basically, do i have to be a US resident to use exchanges that take USD? 
As for your question, here's my thought:
I don't think that you would get any benefit. Because bitcoin is worth a certain amount based on the currency, and that ratio differs between other currencies. so 0.70 USD = $1 CAD = x BTC, no matter the bitcoin, amount you'd get the ratio of CAD:USD

It's posts on the front page, and the couple next pages, talking about how people don't have their money yet for the dip etc.. all of em seem excited?

Yeah I got that, I just assumed it was something different this time! 
Ok, thanks!

Oh. Well that'll make for a couple interesting months then huh? Esp jan 1st for the coinbase users with no wallet

Wow, you're right! Idk why I ask for advice or opinions on anything then!

Was just asking about the fork, I already have with a fair amount of my investment..
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:18:17
I already have with a couple thousand. Was just asking for input before the fork.
Why not ask for help?
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:09:28
Wait, so who can buy btc during the dip?
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:35:11
Is Kraken good? Gdax isnt available in canada unless I already have eth / ltc
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:33:09
Ok, will do!
@_date: 2017-11-24 16:08:29
That's why I was asking for clarification :)
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:40:47
Like if I open up an international bank account or something, kinda deal. Gdax only trades in USD, so I was wondering whether or not that'd be fine.
As for your question, no. I don't think that you would. Because bitcoin is worth a certain amount based on the currency, and that ratio differs between other currencies. so 0.70 CAD = $1 USD = x BTC.

Oh, that makes things clearer! It's basically like cramming for finals
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:29:55
Honestly, fuck the USA government. Figure your god damn government system out. Holy shit - between this and net neutrality, what the fuck. 
granted, wall street is about to jump in on btc, we're probs fine.
@_date: 2017-11-24 07:54:03
if you left your money on coinbase, they duplicate it 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:32:21
Similar vein... 
If I open up a USD account from Canada, can I use gdax or USD trading companies?

"I swear I know what bitcoin is though!"
