This is a straw man argument but I think you bring up some good points.


Bombs like drugs are dangerous products that must be tightly controlled, however they have their purpose and prohibition on either is foolish.


Some things, like drugs and porn are best left to adults who are not so impressionable and in a fragile developmental state, and are aware of the risks and consequences involved in its production and use.


Guns and drugs are involved in many crimes, however there are many people who use both for recreation and utility. Don't punish everybody for the actions of a few, but do provide control over who has access to both.


Human slaves are people held against their will and forced to work for no pay. Drugs may invoke an analogous situation of pushers/addict, but ultimately taking drugs is the choice of the addict. Legalizing and regulating drugs reduces a drug dealer's utility, but we must be careful that advertisers do not become the new pushers.

When new chips are being developed shipping dates should be taken with a grain of salt. Every chip I've ever heard of that will be "out late Q1" always ends up being more like Q3/4.
Never rely on shipping dates of new ASICs.

They didn't "print money" they allowed Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to over leverage their assets. If that's your definition of "printing money" then we all do so every time we take out a loan.
The results of subsequent "printing money" have been pretty good in my opinion. What would have happened if the government allowed the banking system to collapse is impossible to tell. I would be willing to bet it would have been much worse and not get better for a long time.

Right, all contributors to the financial meltdown. However, none of this is "printing money".

Deficit spending was not the cause of the 2008 financial crash. The crash was due to a pumped up real estate market that caused billions (trillions?) of dollars to disappear from the economy.
Bitcoins are awesome, but they are no replacement for fiat currency.

They only had ~$80B in cash between them to cover ~1T of liabilities. Their "cash equivalents" meant nothing when the shit hit the fan, they needed to back their guaranteed loans and they were unable to.

84% of sub-prime mortgage loans were privately backed...
