Had to ask. Is your name a play on cease and desist?

That would be awesome if we can get all mining on solar. 
I think that the energy consumption itself is a challenge, let me do some math here.
Assuming an ant miner s7, it consumes about 1000W and produces around 4TH/s. That gives us around 4GH/W. Considering bitcoin is doing 15Exahashes/s right now, we are looking at 3.5GW (did I do the math right?) of consumption currently.  
Assuming world electric energy consumption increased to 25TWh annually based on Wikipedia trends till 2013 (2,800GW), we are currently a small but rapidly growing portion of that consumption. And this is for basic economic transactions, so it’s literally a transaction cost (what physicists will call friction losses).

I hope not. I think there are reasonable people with reasonable beliefs about scaling on both chains. I think both scaling solutions are worth exploring, but the larger blocks helps in the short term for immediate effect.

His unfinished symphony is spectacular. Agreed, he was a great composer.

Well put, stranger. You write eloquently.

Help me understand how tx malleability would affect a LN transaction. I guess I’m not even sure how a LN transaction works to begin with.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:21:36
Thanks for responding. 
How does it guarantee this? I’m asking for a little more technical detail, I guess, not challenging your statement.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:04:51
Lifecycle costs of paper to be included. I think this would make a fantastic case study.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:17:48
Help me understand this, is it because it takes longer to process blocks? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:20:37
Thanks for responding. 
I think I understand the removal of signatures in a multi-sig transaction from the hash because of potential to change signatures and invalidate the hash. I understand this is where segwit helps remove the need to trust the counterparty since the transaction won’t post if the signatures change. Am I correct?
As for lightning,  does the payment channel open a transaction with a fixed amount of money in it? Sort of like cash settled futures?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:23:01
Ah, gotcha. Again, don’t want to devolve this into a scaling debate. I understand both sides of that argument pretty well, not picking sides in this thread. Just want to figure out energy usage and how either chain addresses this.

Opus 135, his last string quartet (16). The difficult decision, popularized by Milan Kundera in The Unbearable Lightness Of Being. Love both works. Will shut up now. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:20:41
Thanks, but I’m not looking for investment advice. I’m looking for a technical or semi-technical discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:02:19
It is a significant cost for something as basic as economic transactions, but it would be interesting to study the costs of maintaining visa uptime or printing cash in circulation. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:54:50
I see. So the off chain transactions in the payment channel are still based on some sort of block chain? Where is this kept? Who are the miners for this sidechain and how is it being made trustless?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:29:54
Not sure what this means. I guess I’m out of the loop.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:04:50
Oh. Thanks.

Couldn’t resist: if you check out Beethoven’s string quartets, Op. 131 is by far the most melancholic and beautiful pieces I’ve heard. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 14:40:44
That’s an interesting way to look at it. Previously only I knew what I’d spent on if I used multiple sending and receiving addresses. Maybe LN can also be upgraded to be less KYC and more bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:37:09
It has, and the arguments need to evolve with the usage. Bitcoin is exploding onto mainstream commerce, and the energy usage is a pretty serious issue now, more than it ever was before.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:14:45
At the risk of this turning into a scaling-debate battleground (I don’t want to do this, see OP), let me say that increasing the block size in small increments (as evident now from BOTH chains effectively doing so with and without segwit), should help us bide time till layer 2 is viable AND widely adopted.
But I digress, my goal is to understand your thoughts, and those of others, on how energy use will be addressed. It appears you believe that energy use justifies the block chain being used for securing little but the most important transactions. I can understand the argument and I agree that at any scale, at any blocksize, the energy costs will need to be justified for a transaction on the block chain. That can’t become an economic externality to bitcoin if we are going to bank the unbanked.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:33:24
It seems to be one argument for more transactions per block on the face of things. I couldn’t say for sure without the data. I feel the amount of energy expended in mining is directly proportional to the hashpower required to mine a block (difficulty), but someone else responded to this thread saying it is more driven by price. They have a valid point if the hashpower per block isn’t taking into account orphaned blocks or wasted hashpower.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:25:52
Not sure what that means. Elaborate?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:14:55
So, umm, how is this different from me using my credit card for everything I do through a month and dumping my savings into btc? I get that my daily tp purchases don’t need to be etched into the blockchain for ever, but I’m not seeing the point of a locked payment channel over what we already have today with the likes of visa, PayPal or Venmo.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:27:16
Okay, I think I understand this. I’ll reiterate for my own clarity/edification.
When two parties have to sign a transaction, changing the order or the signature itself changes the hashed output of the transaction.
Typically, in a bitcoin transaction, pre-segwit, the hash would include the spender public key, private key signature and receiver public key to make the hash.
Now, with LN opening a transaction would require both parties private key signatures. This poses the problem of trust that the second or last signer may alter the signature or address, and thereby the recorded hash on the main chain, so segwit is used to separate the signatures from the hash data. 
I think I’m lost here. How does this help? Maybe I need to know more about how lightning works. 
Thanks for taking the time to put a detailed response together, btw.

Hadn’t heard of proof of burn, will look up.

Government will tell payment processors on LN what to do as well because it’s a payment processor. Laws aren’t written to affect any specific companies. But we digress, you are moving the argument to “it’s better because it is decentralized” without actually showing how it is so. Starbucks will also need to report its earnings, and they love to track what their customers prefer. So will any other hub. I’m still asking how this is better than what we have currently from a customer/user perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:40:40
Okay. Thanks for your time.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:15:51
Thanks, this is a good start. So the transaction hash in a segwit transaction doesn’t include the signature data for hashing, but the signatures are checked outside of the hash. 
And would transaction malleability affect all multi-sig transactions where the signatures are needed for hashing? How has this been fixed in other chains outside of segwit?
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:05:36
So you’re not actually transacting on the main block chain, but maintaining a tab that closes out on the main chain. Can one theoretically go back to verify transactions in the sidechain from the main chain?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:21:28
Thanks for your time. I don’t want a scaling debate here. Just what this chain thinks of energy usage, and you said you don’t really care about it.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:24:09
Military aspects? Help me understand what you mean by this.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:30:12
How so? Care to elaborate?
