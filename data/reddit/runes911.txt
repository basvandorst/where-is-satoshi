Did they? Proof? That would be cool if they did. 
Edit:  nm I found it.

I believe so. I remember him saying it’ll go back up, eventually. I can’t imagine what your coworkers are going through :(

Is this good news? I can only think that it is. Less mining = lower difficulty.

My father in law had something similar a while back. 200K gone from his retirement fund. I’m not even sure if it recovered. Luckily it didn’t affect him too much as he had backups.

In that case, hopefully it’s just a software glitch.

I wonder what did it: the community uproar about batch transfers, too many leaving, or something else entirely.

It was a year or two ago. I think it was just a dip, but it cost him 200K. No tell how much he had in it if it 200K didn’t hurt him that bad. He was already retired at the time.

I would pay to see that train wreak!

Actually have no idea. When the announcement was made I didn’t find a start date. ����‍♂️

Are you in the US, and missed the many warning that US customers are no longer allowed?
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:42:26
Are you sure? Its pretty obvious I would think at least *someone* else noticed it.

Just when I decide to buy some bitcoin when it’s been $6400 for months, it drops. Sorry everyone probably my fault. :(
@_date: 2019-09-06 19:01:25
Yep. Buying in at $6400, watching your investment fall by &gt;50% then watching it more than double in less than 5 months! What a ride!

I will save you a click, the meeting is on September 24, 2019:
This stupid article doesn't even MENTION the date. Why are crypto news sites such trash...

This is what I always hear. In Japan paper money is more used than credit cards! Most places in Japan won't even take credit cards. So I always wonder why everyone get excited thinking Japan loves Bitcoin...
