Even the top comment here sounds smug. Good luck bitcoin. When I first started getting into bitcoin no one would give me real answers. Only sarcasm and tell me to google my own shit. Dogecoin gave me free Dogecoin. So suck on it and stop taking yourselves so seriously. You're starting to sound like big bankers with a stick up their ass.

Agreed. I gave droid a chance. Apple just works seamlessly IMO. I had an awesome droid with awesome specs. Everytime I really needed the camera it wouldn't work. The HD video had weird lines across it rendering all my videos useless. Thats just the tip of the iceberg too. Terrible terrible experience. Sorry Android. Do your thing and I will do mine. No hate. Just love. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:39:49
Are you joking? I don't disrespect your opinion or anyone else's opinion on hating Apple, but as an Apple user those are actually pretty easy to do...

Thank you. Where can I find more info on this?

Shut up. He has a point... I was skeptical till I actually tried what he said. Incredible...

Finally some sense in this thread. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 17:39:09
This makes sense. Best Buy is desperate for business.

Don't buy a new one. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:40:41
I guess I'm just not seeing why instead of having $X in my hand I would go and buy something worth $X that can do the same thing, but can suddenly be worth less than X.

I don't really like this. It kind of shows bitcoin owners/enthusiasts as the kind of people who own snipers, machetes, and have to violently take out their aggression on things they don't like.
@_date: 2014-03-22 02:15:43
Yay! Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:37:46
I sold my all my Bitcoin back when it was around 800 before it slumped down to what it is now. Every one kept talking about China and other things. I sold to play it safe.
Then it went down more than I thought it would.
Now, I just don't get it. Why would I use Bitcoin for something instead of dollars? Really not trying to offend anyone.

As much as I wish it I don't think we can ever escape these types of corruption... I'm sure there have been huge debates over this topic...
Once Bitcoin is accepted widely why can't it be the perfect means for this corruption? Isn't that why people like it? Because you transfer large sums of money anonymously? Why can't drug cartels trade their millions into Bitcoin? Money is money wether it's digital or not. The possibility for corruption is there.
Dollars can save lives and it can even take lives. Ruin people, corrupt them and the same time provide shelter and food for honest families. I don't see why Bitcoin can't be used corruptly.
Sorry, I guess I just don't get it.
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:34:39
I think he mean an educated debate. Non anonymous. Like bill nye and what's his face just did.

I've been buying btc since 700 n I still don't know wat satoshis r exactly 
@_date: 2017-01-09 07:23:06
Thnx! I googled it shortly after, but appreciate it.
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:46:56
That will never happen. The mainstream media is owned by the big banks that own our entire fraudulent financial economy. They ignore and ridicule anything that threatens it. David vs Goliath. Bitcoin will win eventually unless something better comes along. Point is fiat currencies are far worse than bitcoin. If you were to sit a group of people creating a brand new society or city, explain in depth and detail the current fiat monetary system. Then explain bitcoin and other crypto currencies. Fiat currency will lose. You are born into fiat currency. You are forced into it. For the first time ever there is a better alternative choice. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:43:06
It's mainly a storage of value 
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:53:25
Never listen to your parents or anybody when you believe in something.  Your children will be far superior in knowledge than you in trends and new technology when you are his age. It's just nature. It's better to have lost money and lost it because YOUR choice than to miss an opportunity because someone who knows NOTHING about topic tries to explain why it's a bad topic or idea. 
My dad did something similar to me when I was in the music business. Recently I wanted to buy 400$ btc when it was at $700. I did a lot of research and had already been buying it before. I told my mom and she tried explaining why it's bad. I thanked her for her advice. Luckily I had already learned an important lesson. Never take advice on a topic or idea from someone who knows NOTHING about it.
The truth is, the current fiat currency system we live in is THE biggest scam ever sold to mankind. No one has a say in it. We are born into a corrupt system of debt. We are forced to use dollars that hold a purpose of value. Yet every single day your dollars lose value. It's fucking insane!
Just keep in mind like all assets btc will be overbought AND it will be oversold. Buy low. Sell high. Repeat until 1 million dollars. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:55:58
Every time someone who knows nothing about bitcoin tries to explain why it's a scam. I say that you can say the exact same thing about usd. The truth is that we will always need a currency. You are born into usd and other fiat currencies that are made by corrupt bankers who have full control over it. If you were to explain in detail fiat currencies like usd and bitcoin to somebody and let them choose what kind of society they would like to live in. One with btc or usd. Usd will always lose.

You may never forget but you must try and forgive. He is not perfect and if he truly loves you you owe him as he has sacrificed big chunks of his life for you. Also, I forgot to mention but after my mom gave me that advice I meditated and realized the advice I had learned and bought anyways lol
Learn from your mistakes. It's life my friend. And you never truly know that you would've made millions. Something could've gone wrong. Do not assume a loss of success and blame that assumption on someone so critical in your life. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 03:59:16
Is the value of your dollar decreasing every single day?
@_date: 2015-02-13 09:16:24
Oh man. Start ups are everywhere. They're trickling down to San Mateo for sure. We cater to many of them. Big business. Tech boom bro. Tech boom.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:57:27
My restaurant and my friends store accept digital currency. We're in San Mateo, CA. 
If you want some backstory. Some dude from SF was walking up and down el camino real convincing biz owners to sign up to snapcard. It was completely free for us and since we were the first few to sign up we have no fees whatsoever.
Funny thing is that we don't receive Bitcoin at all. People pay in the digital currency. It gets transferred somewhere and we get deposited dollars into our bank account. Makes me feel like someone is just hyping digital currencies up. 
Also, no ones used digital currency to pay yet. Same goes for me friends store. Well one guy did for him but the tablet they provided him with didn't even turn on. We've had it for like 5 months. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:40:16
I own a Peruvian Restaurant. Him a vape store. You'd have to let us know though to make sure the tablets are working well and charged haha
Check out snapcard. There's a bunch of stores that probably have it. If ur ever up here let me know. :)
@_date: 2015-02-15 18:48:22
Right. So Bitcoin isn't so great compared to real money. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 09:38:39
Haha I don't think companies like Apple or google are bullshiting too much. People do bullshit though. Bitcoins not that big here really. The only place I know it's big is the internet :P
I also heard China's big in it but I really don't know. I stumbled on this thread on my front page from when I subscribed to this a looooong time ago
