Why do people make "HODL" post? Why do they care what other people do with their bitcoin? Because they don't want the price to fall to the point where they are in the negative. It's easy to call others weak when they're still in the plus by a good margin.

Not how it works, you need to compare the amount of tethers printed to the total amount of money that has gone into crypto. Depending on what estimate you believe, that means 20-33% of the money put into crypto may be fake. 
Imagine 20-33% of the USD (paper bill or bank account) in the USA turns out to be counterfeit and not useable anymore. You think that only would have a small effect on the USA?

Lookup wash trading. Bitfinex allows wash trading. Pumping volume by selling to yourself at the same price without fees... Bitfinex and tether is the same group of people. They printed $1B in the last month alone, $2B in total.  Compare those $2B to the money that actually entered bitcoin. Considering the price spike has been in the last few months, its properly around 25 times less than the market cap (not every coin has been exchanged for fiat, a lot have been mine and hodl), so $4B, half of that could be fake tethers.

The price of bitcoin is purely held up by the amount of hype (new money in) and tethers printed. If no one puts money in anymore, the price can only go down. 1800 new coins created daily, $22.5M at current price. If they sell, you need $22.5M entering daily just to keep the price where it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:22:52
1800 new coins are created everyday (on average) 
12.5 coins / 10min average.
Those miners need to have their expenses paid, so you'd need worst case $18M in new money a day, just to keep the price in status quo.

1. Put $1M in bank account. 
2. Print $1M tether.
3. Lend exchange $1M tether
4. Exchanges buy coins for $1M tether.
Bankruptcy exchange and be a claimant on the coins, loans gets repaid first in the line of creditors. 
You now have $1M USD + $1M in coins and some poor bastards holding $1M IOU with a note saying "Reserve right to refuse to redeem". Only account holders at the Tether company can even try to redeem them and the exchange (account holder) doesn't have any... You do.

I don't gamble with my money, that would be stupid. Crypto is high risk/high reward and he rewards have been reaped, at least until everyone forgot about them for the next cycle. No wealth is being created, it's pure money in vs money out. Well, now it is fake money in vs money out.

Bitcoin can run on one node, the rest is just gold digging. So it is not backed by energy. Energy is also a cost, it lowers value for the one creating.
The ledger isn't "immutable", only when certain condition are met, but gain 50%+ hash power and you can do damage. Find cracks in the hashing algoritme used and you can rewrite history.
Is backed laws of mathematics, but that doesn't mean its safe. Hashing algorithms have fallen through time and been "broken". It may be safe right now, but that doesn't mean it will be in the future. Also there is the possibility that someone fiddled with the implementation (like NSA, wouldn't be the first time they did that)

Imagine I was allowed to create a coin I could print and claim is pegged, call it FakeUSD. You all deal at my exchange. Every time you sell, you get my FakeUSD, just like Bitfinex the account is just FakeUSD, but labeled USD. I can print and buy as many coins as I want. 
I print $100M and buy bitcoins at $10K. It pushed the price up.
I print $100M and buy bitcoins at $15K. It pushed the price up.
I print $100M and buy bitcoins at $20K. It pushed the price up.
I print $100M and buy bitcoins at $25K. It pushed the price up.
I print $100M and buy bitcoins at $30K. It pushed the price up.
I print $100M and buy bitcoins at $1M.
People are willing to sell to me, because I give them paper profit. I mean the last guy who I bought a coin from just got $1M FakeUSD for his bitcoin!
You see any problem? I mean, it is just a shit coin about to die, why would bitcoin be affected at all right?
The problem is the scale that tether has infected crypto. 20-33% of the money that went into crypto may just be FakeUSD.

Someone has to HODL the loss, might as well be you. For every one cashing out a profit, someone has to put that back in using a buy or the price will go down. When the price hits "zero" worth, the rest are HODLing losses in the magnitude of people's fiat profit. There is no magical fiat creation happening in crypto.

Theres estimated that the total amount of money entered crypto is between $6B-$10B, now suddenly $2.2B turns out to be air.
You want to buy a coin, you offer $10K, Bitfinex prints some tether and offers $12.5K (they want the price to be above $12.5K), you then counter with $13K. Tether implodes and you want to sell at $13K but the only one wanting to buy at $12.5K was Bitfinex, now you're back to $10K. Everyone is panicking and selling to get out, $10K is best case.

Last time this happened:
"The most famous such event was in 2014 when Ghash managed to gain as much as 55% if we recall well. That led to public calls for miners to boycott Ghash, and eventually they did with it now being irrelevant, but not before a rogue employee within Ghash double spent a small amount."

Let’s assume they all use the best miner out there: S9 ~0.1 W/GH
That means they use: 3.500.000 kWh
Every hour, not including cooling or anything else.
The are alle located in China, they have an average price of $0.08 kWh
That means they burn $672000/day or $20M/month bestcase, not including a place, labour, cooling, depreciation or any other expense. Just to keep the price stable, there has be tons of people just throwing money down the gutter non stop to feed them.

Minning is a cost. It's no different than real mining, if it costs $10000 to extract an ounce of gold from the earth, that doesn't make gold worth $10000/ounce, that only determines if it is profitable to do so or not.

You should already know market cap in crypto is a running joke. It's the latest sale price times all coins. 
Price is $1/coin, market cap would be $21M. Some buys for $100.000 and it drives the price to $10/coin. Now market cap is $210M.
You have to compare those $2B to the money that entered into crypto and that is "only" $6B-$10B depending on who you ask.

Even if we assume it is just linear. Lets say a total of $0.01 per bitcoin is required to enter the system to push the price from $10 to $20 ($210.000). You'd need ($10.000/$10)*$210.000 or $2.100.000.000 to push the price from $10.000 to $20.000.

An article that tries to relabel wasting tons of energy on pointless calculation. Might as well just dig up coal and light it on fire in a big pile. This community would call it healthy heating.
"Alternative energy" was doing fine without bitcoin wasting it for nothing.

A word of warning, if you think $6K is the bottom and buy, it only needs to go $3K for you to be down 50%.

2 reasons creditcards "ban" crypto. 
1) They don't want you to buy crypto using their money, use a debit card. (they don't want to end up with a lot of people unable to repay their debts in one single swoop)
2) Point churning (buy coins, sell coins, repay and accumulate points)

Market cap is worthless in crypto, it is a running joke.
Market cap = last price * total coins in existence.
Lets say capuchincoin has maximum of 1000 coins, first 999 was sold for $1.
Market cap is now $1000. 
The last coin is sold for $1000. 
Market cap is now $1.000.000, yet only $1999 entered the system.

If you think people losing $2.2B won't affect crypto (20-33% of the money put into crypto), you're so delusional that nothing will help you.

If you had more experience you'd know why it's crashing. Try buying more. If it was $25K I would still be telling you it's just "money in vs money out" scheme. It will pop when people start cashing out the money you gave them. You're in a hole because no one wants to pay it forward anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:20:05
I'll second that, be smart, get out and make a profit. Re-buy when it's dead at $1K-$2K and wait a few years until everyone burned forgot about it and the next run and drop to $20K can start again.

When you sell or deposit USD on some exchanges, instead of having USD you get USDT (I owe you's). They claim that each tether (USDT) has a equal amount of USD stored in another company that they claimed to be "not them". But it turned out in the "paradise papers" both the largest exchange and that tether company are owned by the same shady people. 
 
They won't release any evidence of the USD stored and you basically have to take their word for it. They hired an external auditor was going to provide proof, but they packed up shop and left without a word, most likely because something is severely wrong. 
They can print those tethers at will and buy coins with it. They printed like $1.2B in the last 2 months.

Bitcoin is not used for anything, it's money in vs money out. I call it the chicken scheme, everyone keeps putting money in to get the price up, once people start to chicken out and cash in, the price crashes. Last man out is the looser.  Money is leaving fast right now.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:08:04
It bounces up after each drop, it will eventually go kamikaze again. Properly just after Bitfinex runs out of those USD $100M tether they just printed in euro.
You think it's a coincidence that Bitfinexed twitter was joined by fake accounts and then suspended just as the price goes a bit up?
