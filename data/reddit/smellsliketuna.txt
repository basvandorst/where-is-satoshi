I understand that you most likely aren't an accountant, but you clearly know more than I do so I'm going to ask.
So, if I were to get audited, I can simply show proof of my purchase of BTC (which I use to pay my contractor)? Do I need to be able to show to whom it went?
Thanks!  I understand if this is too granular for your level of accounting knowledge.

It looks like the rates on btcjam vary from deal to deal, topping out around 12% for high risk loans.

I'm less concerned about FMV, and more concerned about how I treat the payment to my contractor.  If I normally pay them and send them a 1099 at the end of the year (beginning of the year technically), do I still have to 1099 them?  What If I paid them in bitcoins and not USD?

Coinbase doesn't exchange and quick enough for my business. Any good alternatives?

Interesting. I guess the difference is the collateral. btcjam.com seems to be very similar to lending club or prosper. Our investments are backed up by first liens on real estate, in the name of the lender.

Aaah, you're right. Sorry about that. I knew I read it somewhere. Thank you.

I have been fully invested for the past 10 years.  I'm a private lender and I'm starting to see credit issues that I believe are precurser to to a dramatic correction, at least in the single family investment market.    Contagion is a real issue so I'd expect to see an equally dramatic correction in the securities markets as well.  When this happens, which could be a year or two away, the dollar will be just fine.  In the interim I am moving towards cash in a systematic way.  As my investments mature I am going to sit in cash for a while.  Also moving out of my stocks (which admittedly I don't have much of due to distrust in the marketplace). I'm presently exploring selling my home, too.  I have private equity investments I can't do anything about, and I have retirement funds I also can't do anything with, so I feel that starting that move to cash is probably wise now.  I'm about 10% cash at the moment, hope to be at 50-60% by the end of 2019.

If every company in the world accepted bitcoin and traded immediately for fiat, this would exponentially impact the adoption rate for bitcoin users.  Companies don't need to hold bitcoin, they just need to accept it as payment.  If everyone accepted pigs feet for payment pigs feet would be worth a lot more too.

I’m moving to cash, personally, so I can buy assets when I’m ready.

Oh no doubt.  I plan to start my btc buying late this year.  There is a population of btc supporters that aren't ever going to give up on this platform and they will prevent it from crossing below a certain threshold, whatever that threshold may be.  We know it isn't going to become worthless.  That threshold may very well be $3,000, but I suspect it's lower.  If it get's below a couple thousand dollars I'll buy an amount that will make my wife very uncomfortable.

When stocks and housing crashes there will be a flight to safety, which bitcoin is not considered to be.

Nobody on the street was saying there'd be a correction in the housing market 4 years into that cycle. You *want* to believe your asset of choice, the one you've decided to hang your shingle on, is different.  It's not.  This is one of the most classic investment mistakes retail investors make; they fall in love with the asset rather than the money.  Don't fall into the trap.  
I don't know what you do for a living but I'm a private lender.  I am on the front lines of this.  I'm watching institutional money throw underwriting standards out the window to chase yields.  I see borrowers failing to make payments at a quickening pace.  I see housing prices stalling and the crowded single family investment space chew everyone up right now.  I see buyers with terrible debt coverage ability getting into rentals with no equity and slim margins.  The writing is on the wall but for some it's not out of sight.  I'm not telling you what to do with your money.  All I'm saying is that you shouldn't be so naive as to think that your investment choice won't take a hit when the next correction happens, which we're clearly approaching sometime in the near future.  Hubris is what traders want on the opposite side of their trade and they're waiting to fucking slaughter you like the hog you appear to be.

Nobody knows how bad the next correction will be but the data supports a violent one.  Corrections happen.  The housing market corrects every 10 or so years.  With Americans in debt more than ever, a correction could be really bad.  We are now spending more than 25% of our income to pay down debt, and although we're making more money the cost of our most expensive things (like medical care) are growing at a greater pace than our income.  These are not good.  And let's not get confused, this is bad for the price of bitcoin when it happens.

We have a long way to go before any decoupling goes on. I hope I’m wrong but bitcoin is still a baby.

Because “smart money” flees to “safety”. Everything is a trade to them, no matter the asset. They didn’t buy into bitcoin and drive up the price because they valued the concept; it was a trade. When the housing market, stocks, or bonds hiccup, they will flee to the dollar as they always do. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 07:10:39
You make a great point about smart money positioning, and it's probably the reason the bloodletting subsided.  This mirrors other trades historically, though, and shouldn't be interpreted as market confidence.  It's all part of their patient trading discipline.

I’m moving to cash. Housing market cycles are roughly ten years; we’re due. There’s loose underwriting and record amounts of credit, we’re at an all time high of college loan forebearamce, increasing cost of living beyond increases in income; the list goes on. 
I’m moving to cash and I’m patient. You really should chill by the way, this is just a conversation. No need to get shitty with strangers sharing their view. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:45:04
You've made so many good arguments, thanks for the conversation.

The way I see it, there are two buyers of BTC; people who buy into the purpose, and traders.  I think the floor is where it was before it went parabolic, maybe a little higher, because they aren't in it for the "investment".  They aren't going to sell because Wall Street is cold on it; they don't live in that world, they don't care.  As long as traders are in on the trade it will be coupled, but I think a lot of those people will get shaken out.  Like you, this is just an opinion and I'm usually wrong.

thanks for the heads up.  I thought about that, but I wanted to get an idea of what people are *most* passionate about.  Thank you, again, for completing the survey.  Mobile technology is still young and nobody has perfected it, so getting this information is critical if we're going to do it right.  I would also appreciate any additional feedback you're willing to offer.
@_date: 2013-02-14 22:10:44
I will do that.  Let me get a few more submissions and I'll let you know.
Thanks!
