I'm about 1 more dip and $80 away from "fuck it." Close but I never invested "important money" so it's whatever 
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:55:54
I don't have the time to comb through the comments from every post but I have questions:
I own BTC, do I have to do anything specific to make it SegWit ready?
Also, does anyone have a good write-up on making a lightning node for rPi?

Oh, it's 48 business hours, so 6 days.
Seriously that sucks when you try to prepare and they bone you
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:44:50
What are the benefit to running a node? Is there financial gain to be had, minimum requirements?

Coinbase counts it as a sale

Oh there was a holiday so Monday doesn't count, then Steve brought in cake last Wednesday so they got nothin' done... check back February 30th ��
I don't know why it hasn't processed. I don't know what needs to happen from vault to wallet. Is there any kind of 2FA or double email confirm you're missing?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:29:19
Dude you didn't send BTC to your ADA wallet, did you? If yes, it's gone
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:00:02
Thank you for contacting Coinbase support. Your comments have been recorded for future consideration.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:26:37
Oh, I meant "fuck it" as in "I don't care abut dips anymore" not "I'm done with this"
I must've misunderstood the context 
@_date: 2018-01-22 00:01:38
Daily means all day,every day...right?
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:17:12
Great designs, there's so much more you could do! Also it's ironic that you don't accept crypto as payment��

You pay a 10% penalty and then pay the income tax on the money in a Roth IRA

The people that pay with Bitcoin aren't the ones reading the pamphlet. You can't sell butter and put, "butter does not contain peanuts" but have a jar of peanut butter sitting there. My point is, while your intentions are good(and those physical Bitcoin look cool), giving false information as a "get to know Bitcoin" doesn't help adoption.

I would do it for 2BTC. 2x a week for 2 years. Let's draw up the contract

Just poking fun. Both USDT and USD are scams in their own right, but I'm just finding it about USDT now

I understand what you're saying, but I think you're missing my point. If you get something that offers free postage, it's free to you- complimentary, like you said.
To use your analogy, it's as if you went to the post office to learn how to mail a package and they say, "postage is free always" but they still charge you postage at all times, only they change the numbers in that particular post office (the discount offered).
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:07:45
But there are transaction fees. You're not educating people if you're lying to them
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:24:16
I keep seeing comments about huge fees. I buy with Gdax and my fees around $1.40. Do they scale up with more money? Or do different exchanges charge way higher fees?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:05:46
Because you've all apparently invested in a boat. You know, *because of the the implication*...
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:09:36
Deposit on Coinbase, login to Gdax, avoid fees.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:02:49
I panic sold for a profit in the middle of the dip expecting to buy 'near the bottom' and it recovered too quickly for me to get back in. Now I'm sitting here hoping for a dip just so I can buy more and lower my average cost....
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:42:06
Where are fees that expensive? I've only seen large fees on Binance. I use Gdax and have only paid ~$1.40 per
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:32:23
Ok now, just hypothetically, what if you were explaining it to a 5 year old idiot(still me)....
How do they drive up the fees? By not processing transactions, making people think they have to pay more to get theirs done?
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:15:23
I'm an idiot so ELI5 if I'm still missing it- if I were to send BTC from my wallet to yours, thats what is costing oodles of doodles?
@_date: 2019-07-24 14:24:35
Should I not be using samourai wallet now? I felt proud of myself for leaving coinbase (not your keys, etc) but now I feel like I'm more vulnerable with my choice of wallet
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:05:33
Wtf? He painted that with a very personal twist on C&amp;H. If they throw it out they don't deserve OP let alone the BTC
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:05:40
Because you've all apparently invested in a boat. You know, *because of the the implication*...
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:51:25

I had to submit the photos(front/back) of my license 4-5 times each. I was stubborn because I knew they were crystal clear and it should work. Eventually each picture was accepted and a day later I was verified. My only advice is just keep trying, unfortunately
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:53:31
Even trading for alt coins, the transactions worked out to like 9¢-40¢ per on Bittrex. I'm assuming I'm either dealing in too small dollars or I'm missing something. A guy at work was complaining that when he bought $50 BTC and by the time he got a coin it was $18 worth. I've been trading in the $300 range and my fees have been tiny
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:18:51
Imagine that you're explaining it to an idiot(me). 
What does this information tell us? Is there shadiness afoot?
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:01:08
Incredibly helpful! Thank you for this.
I was unaware that miners can choose their transactions. I was also unaware that you could choose what you pay as a transaction fee... 
How does the crypto community move on from BTC? I bought into a few of the coins you mentioned, but for the most part I had to buy BTC or ETH to trade for altcoins. Do we all have to start phasing BTC out as other coins pose better solutions to current issues(mainly fees and speed)?
@_date: 2018-05-03 23:53:35
It says “$1,000,000” so I’m assuming it’s referring to the US dollar
@_date: 2018-10-13 23:59:14
Yeah they already lost their money in February ��

I did a bit of research a few months ago because I wanted to spend $20 and get a big box of money. It's a huge crime for them to be caught sending money outside the country, and I'm sure they're so desperate at this point that anything getting sent out of Venezuela is inspected. Also the government won't sell to anyone outside of the country. You'd have to go to Venezuela and somehow smuggle out whatever you could, and if you get caught you're pretty much done for.
@_date: 2019-08-12 01:29:31
If you have access to coinbase you can earn other crypto for free! Then you can convert it all to BTC or hold it in other coins- your choice! DAI, XLM, BAT... There are a bunch, about $50 worth it you do them all.
@_date: 2019-08-01 10:21:03
Nobody? The words, "There are no transaction fees." Are written right there on the paper under, "What is Bitcoin?"  
So I believe you're incorrect that **nobody** would think there are no transaction fees, when on the informational pamphlet it says, with no subtly, **"There are no transaction fees."**
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:44:46
I think it’s incredible that you mention how people can mine with their phones and “some dollars per month” but the monthly minimum wage is just over a single dollar...

What’s with the little signs on the front of the table in English?

That was the amount he was sending. The link was to show that it was put on the chain and is waiting for confirmation

I'm currently waiting two hours in the same situation. Withdrew funds and nothing has happened yet. They took my BTC and gave me a transfer ID but nothings moved
Update: mine has also moved and is on its way.

Holy shit that's fast. I've been using bovada for over a decade, and back when it was bodog... Now I feel old. It's really about comfort, and all the interaction I've had with their support has been great. I will definitely look into bookmaker! Good luck and bet the colts -5

Robinhood buys are 1% above market instead of charging trade fees. Also, can you withdraw from Robinhood?
@_date: 2019-10-27 17:44:59
OP was basically saying, "look at this address and please help with my transaction" but if someone wanted to do some malicious digging, it's possible they could find out who the OP is, and now that they know OP has BTC, can hack/attack them for their money.
You should not keep your BTC in an exchange because you do not own the private key to restore the wallet. That being said, your choices are your own. I held my BTC on coinbase for a good 1.5yr before finally feeling confident enough to move it to a wallet. I really enjoyed the free withdrawals, but right now it costs $0.015 for a ~1hr confirmation and $0.09 to get confirmed in about 5-15 minutes. I can live with these prices to know I own the keys to my crypto.
@_date: 2019-10-21 23:31:07
Cash app's price was about 1.5% higher. Obviously not as bad as 25% from this ATM but I personally just stick to coinbase pro and pay 10-25¢
@_date: 2019-10-27 16:34:20
Yay! Breathe that wonderful sigh of relief and then send some to bovada and bet football ��
@_date: 2019-06-01 17:41:37
Do you have to stay there for an hour until it gets confirmed?
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:53:09
Aha, thanks! Wasn't meant to be sarcastic but reading it back, I could hear my neckbeard forming.

It's starting to make more sense, it's just something I've never known about in the 3 years I've owned BTC so I feel extra dumb. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-22 18:47:59
Thanks so much. Three people explained it and I still don't quite understand. I get lost somewhere in me sending a private key(which I thought I was never to share) to show something was signed...but if i send it then it's not something only I hold, so how could it be proven to be me?
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:25:47
Then you'd better sell when it starts dropping and buy more for cheaper
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:50:37
"You have to understand what first-seen-safe means. It doesn't mean it's always safe. Even with zero human interaction there are reasons a transaction which was seen first doesn't become the one eventually confirmed into the longest permanent chain.
It's about probabilities. When selling items ~$25 or less the 5% probability that the tx you thought was valid ends up invalidated works fine as a write-off cost of doing business."
Wtf is this analogy? 5% chance of invalid transaction as 'cost of doin business'? That's absurd
@_date: 2019-05-22 16:54:16
Can you explain what this is? I feel like I've heard of on chain messages but I'm too stupid to find anything about it
