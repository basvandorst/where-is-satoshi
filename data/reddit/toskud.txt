Have they made any statement of and anti-BCH stance?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:15:17
The miners don't need to flood their blocks. They can chose which transactions they want to include in a block. They don't have to fill the blocks (but it makes economic sense to fill the blocks with the most valuable transactions), and they don't have to include transactions in any specific order (e.g. most paying, oldest, largest, smallest or whatever).
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:26:26


Yup, just don't broadcast the transaction before finding a block. I don't believe in this "The miners are spamming the network" story, but that's one way to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:07:06

I don't get the analogy. What is about to "explode" with BU, and what will then happen with miners signalling for BU?
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:15:26
Your logic is backwards. Established miners already have equipment and know-how. If mining is made more profitable by a higher bitcoin exchange rate, they will profit more. The increased profitability might attract new miners, but the established miners are at an advantage like I just said. There is also a lag in time between the increased profitability and new hashpower coming online, and another short lag before the difficulty adjusts.
@_date: 2017-03-18 12:09:21
I get that you could get more airflow from a larger fan, but that funnel makes the case very clumsy (IMHO).
Why not just use a 60mm fan mounted directly to the top plate? Do you really need an 80mm fan to cool a Raspberry Pi 3?
@_date: 2017-03-26 19:43:41


How so? I think you mean node centralization. Mining is already "heavily" centralized compared to running a node as the former requires investing large amounts of money into mining equipment. Running a node requires an internet connection and a simple computer, priced at $30 and up.
Increasing the block size limit would make running a full node somewhat more expensive over time, as the node will require more space to store the full block chain, which will get bigger with bigger blocks. It's nothing that a $100 HDD wouldn't solve for the foreseeable future though, and most people already have plenty of space available. The "centralization" argument about the block size limit is mainly just made up and has very little truth to it.
@_date: 2017-03-27 11:22:44

I think I once did a calculation of sorts. IIRC, I found that you shouldn't put more than 1000000000000 BTC (more BTC than there will ever be) in a single address, since then it would be more profitable to try hashing out the private key to that address instead of mining in the usual way.

@_date: 2013-11-03 16:42:46
Your mining performance on its own doesn't matter for the purposes of assesing the investment. The important numbers are hashes per second per dollar, hashes per joule ( (hashes per second) per watt ) and delivery time. If someone could sell you 1 GH/s with 1 GH/J for a few dollars with a guaranteed delivery time of a few days, it would still be a wise investment - something that would earn you back more than what you have to put in.

At current difficulty, 1GH/s makes $1.90 a week. Assuming difficulty will increase 50% every ten days, you will make those $3 back in two weeks and a day. You will also earn $2 more before the return is low enough to not be worth it.
That's 66% profit in a month. Pretty nice, I'd say.

I don't think the difficulty will level out, not for a very long time (10 years or so). However, the difficulty increase will probably level out. The difficulty has been rising more or less exponentially for large parts of bitcoin history ([Jan '10 - Jul '11 and from Jan '13](
In the future, I think we will see the difficulty settling for a linear rise, like it did for most of '12.

Swedbank's security department is keeping a close eye on bitcoin and localbitcins in particular.

Yup, the article is full of faulty assumptions. Here's an example: *"As more coins are generated, these problems get ever more complex, increasing the cost of computing power necessary to generate them, and so setting a floor underneath the price."*
Bitcoin has been traded for less than the cost to mine them, on several occasions from the block reward halving until early this year.

The value of a single bitcoin is pretty irrelevant. For example, a single Latvian lati is worth more than a dozen Swedish kronor, but the economy of Sweden is still better off than the economy of Latvia.
What's more interesting is the net worth of all bitcoins in existence, the market capitalization of bitcoin if you will. It's more than a billion US dollars, and that's telling something about the size of the bitcoin economy.
