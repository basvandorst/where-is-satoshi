almost NOTHING will ever be comparable to Gox
bitfinex doesn't have close to 60% marketshare, neither does tether make up a that high percentage of the daily volume
@_date: 2018-01-31 22:18:54
and you obviously haven't followed btc back then
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:19:22
If I hodl'd I'd have less than 5% of what I have now. No thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-23 11:06:03
Guess you lost a lot of money.
That's okay, can happen to the best.
@_date: 2018-05-05 14:18:19
not representative, but okay
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:07:53
back in 2014 all4btc used to be legit, but it has changed its owned since then and I wouldn't trust them anymore (there have also been some negative reviews since then)

not like your english is the finest
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:05:49
But does he know what toilets even are?
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:15:15
not really
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:16:26
lmao, comparing malta to bangladesh
guess that piece of news is the only thing you know about it
malta has a lower homicide rate than france, finland, canada, sweden, denmark, and is just above the uk

1. no lol
2. thanks for showing how uninformed you are
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:06:49
Any more conspiracies?
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:03:07
You actually sound like a newcoiner.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:15:27
Exactly this. I don't think many people would care if they just kept it as Bitcoin Cash and kept saying BCH. But nope, it's "Bitcoin" now and Bitcoin is "Bitcoin Core".
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:07:15
Except so many people know about btc
And then there's btrash, something that's less well-known than verge lmao
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:38:55
except that's wrong and most hodlers probably bought way above $100
@_date: 2018-04-13 12:35:30
you even got offended from him telling you not to get offended at everything
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:12:59
nice butthurt, do you have some more of it?
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:10:29
wow, people on here don't like the fact that btrash promoters actively mislead people and spread false information?! fuck those people!
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:12:06
there's no battle
btrash doesn't stand a chance, literally no one knows about it outside a few forums. This has also been proven by the fact that they try to sell it as "Bitcoin", they have nothing and try to ride on the fame of another coin.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:09:11
well then
EVERYONE BUY TRX NOW!!! TRX TO REPLACE BTC SOON
my kaaaaaarmaaaa, go karma-whore somewhere else
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:15:56
newcoiner kid
