this post gets dangerously close to explaining why bitcoin is not a commodity but a currency controlled by an anonymous central bank run by miners.
why is this blasphemy allowed here? there is only a small step from understanding this to understanding that bitcoin cash BCH is also bitcoin, instead of just some scam or fake.

markets can remain irrational for longer than you can stay alive.
Investing in bitcoin is the same as investing in any other company:
Dont focus only on technicals (price), look also on fundamentals, human resources and sentiment.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:51:16
yes, im being pedantic on wording, because we are discussing very different concepts with very similar names. And i genuinely want to understand where this "blockchain, not bitcoin" narrative comes from in case of people that technically seem to know what they are talking about. So thanks for being patient with me :)
For me "using bitcoin technology for something else than bitcoin" sounds like using integration per partes technology for something else than integration ...say cutting onions ..yes both cut something in smaller parts.
yes, cipher blocks and the bitcoin blockchain both work on series of blocks, but for completely different reasons, to solve different problems.
in case of block ciphers it originally was:
- "A block cipher by itself allows encryption only of a single data block of the cipher's block length. For a variable-length message, the data must first be partitioned into separate cipher blocks." 
whereas in bitcoin it is:
- achieving consensus in massively distributed asynchronous byzantine network
Yes, block ciphers later added alteration detection to authenticity proof, and yes bitcoin blockchain also needs alteration detection to work, but thats not what "the bitcoin invention" is about.
The dead give-away is that in block cyphers block sizes are measured in bits, but in bitcoin blockchain block sizes are measured in minutes. (cue the absurdity of the raging 1MB blocks debate)
Bitcoin blockchain is as much derivative of the block cipher chains as it is of lego blocks.

there are of course two problems with that:
1. what you described is not fundamentally different/better than the ACHs/SEPAs/SWIFTs of today

thank you for exploring this topic with me


this seems like hashing a stream ..a rather trivial problem ..if i google "hashing stream of data" theres no mention of blockchain in sight
maybe i just dont understand what you mean by blockchain / blockchain technology ..could you please write / point me to a formal definition you are using? also i think knowing what problem it exactly solves better than other approaches is essential
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:34:05
well, when people talk about blockchain in context of bitcoin, they have the first meaning in mind:
"Block chain (database), sequential transaction database found in cryptocurrencies derived from bitcoin"
which DOES need bitcoin.
When you say "Blockchain technology" you seem to have the last meaning in mind:
"Cipher block chaining, a block cipher mode of operation in cryptography, usually abbreviated as CBC"
which, you are right, does NOT need bitcoin. But it is something completely unrelated to the bitcoin blockchain. It just happens to have the same name.

OK sorry for being an ass. Let me try politely. I hope you understand this war brings out the worst in people.


that is not an issue, 
    128*128 = 16384 //ONE 2MB transaction - this is a toxic block 16 minutes to validate
    64*64*2 = 8192 //TWO 1Mb transactions - not a problem 8 minutes to validate
(numbers are pulled out of ass just to illustrate the concept)
1. So as i just showed *"quadratic hashing problem"* is not really a problem.
2. As you showed bandwidth is also NOT an issue for up to 4MB.
So can we finally have standard 2MB blocks instead of the 4MB segwit blocks please?

the "100+ developers" part is insultingly nonsensical. The last 2 levels on the right should be:

Also the right rectangle/summary should say
"Lets not shoot ourselves in the foot for no damn reason at all." or
"bitcoin first, blockstream second" or
"bitcoin must be digital cash in the future, but lets make sure there is a future first (and argue about imaginary problems later.)"
im not even going to pretend i could do the left part unbiased - for me its all painfully nonsensical. You did a respectable job.

yeah, we better cripple electric vehicles, premature adoption is the last thing we need, said GM and bankrupted.
**You can not stop progress**, the world is going to move forward with or without you.
All the risk factors you mention are very valid, but we have absolutely no other choices but to take these risks or die.
It should be thought about how to *mitigate these risks*, but in no way are they an argument in favor of fighting adoption/progress.
When you fight progress you are *invariably* with absolute 100% certainty going to end on the wrong side of history.

aha, and where are they putting their transactions? definitely not into the 0.987 MB blocks. Maybe into the mempool that is currently at 30 (*thirty*) MB? (all those damn pesky new users spamming the network on every price hike)
And are they staying or saying to their friends "wtf is this shit it does not work" after such an experience?


obviously nonsense - it was never problem until blocks were full, and will not be a problem until 8MB are full (couple years).


thats a logical fallacy called false dichotomy (and a blockstream company PR slogan)
no reason not to have 2MB and SW/LN (in fact we absolutely need both because (1)**SW/LN needs bigger blocks anyways**, (2) 2MB scales # of users, SW/LN scales # of transactions)


2MB hardfork is a long-term, decentralized scaling solution (sea Adreas' talk on internet scaling) that can be phased in virtually as safely as 2MB softfork (aka segwit-SF) (it is in some ways marginally safer and in some marginally less safe)

1MB blocklimit = complete ban on new users
1MB blocklimit = delaying adoption by pissing users off with intentionally shitty experience, in order to give us more time to prepare better experience for them when they come later = insanity and bankruptcy
Did google implement some query quota? 1 query per user per day? Or did they refuse to add another server  when the current ones were overloaded? (btw there was one company that refused to fix their shitty user experience - MySpace). The correct analogy with your google example for bitcoin would be not to run advertisements for bitcoin until we sort this mess. With that i absolutely agree. And in fact many people stopped advocating for bitcoin.

Bitcoin is a new kind of financial system, that works without central authorities like governments or banks and has no inflation or capital controls.
It is backed by a network of computers that onyone can join. Random group of computers from this network spends around 10.000 USD of energy every 10 minutes to verify transactions that happened these past 10 minutes.
They get 12 new bitcoins for their spent energy after everyone else verifies they are not cheating.

well, since everything could be done by SF, that means no HF ever, that means just accumulation of tech debt forever - this is not how you make a robust system with clean codebase and long lifetime.

@_date: 2016-11-21 20:53:39
1. nope BU wont disappear, this would happen:
Which is BU without segwit. And im pretty certain that most of the people supporting BU now would support this effort.
2. You really think that if BU activates (does a majority fork) that Core disappears? I don't think so. 2-3 blockstream guys might. The rest will just release Core with "1MB" changed to "2/8/32/configurable?MB".
3. give it a rest, you cant talk your way out of this, this is not a matter of opinions, this is a matter of logic. You cannot (1) claim slushpool is neutral, does not play political games (2) and push SW on everyone + allow BU to vote for segwit and not allow Core to vote _(EB?; AD?)_ + not distribute dontcare votes (3) and not be a hypocrite. Sorry i love you man, and you certainly have right to do it, but i have to call it what it is now ;) I know you love SW and cognitive dissonance is a tricky bitch.
4. How the hell is it worth it for you to dunk into this shit now? Considering how probable it seems now that SW is dead on arrival. At least you should have waited until SW is 5% from activation and then enable SW for everyone - so your dirty political trickery has a chance to actually achieve something meaningful ;)
@_date: 2016-11-20 21:57:36

by that logic you should have an option for those voting for core to add the BU string to codebase at the same time. (indicating you want core to get rid of the limit finally). And enable it by default for all miners of course ;) Otherwise the hypocrisy is far too obvious.

@_date: 2016-11-20 12:49:01

@_date: 2016-11-30 11:29:42


good, do you see now why this type of restaurant service would be useless? (hint. if it were useful, there would be at least one restaurant with normal and priority queues)
in other words:


cool story bro, yes such a restaurant service has great value, but only because there is just one queue. If it had normal and priority queues it would be entirely ridiculous, retarded and useless.


sure, so are you saying that bitcoin wallets should have only one setting for the transaction fee? if people want to pay less they should go next door to the ethereum wallet?


sure, but only because it was always assumed that the supply would not be artificially fixed. (does your restaurant have infinite space in the back where the owner can expand if the queues are long? no? does your restaurant have normal and priority queues? no? then please stop spreading the restaurant fallacy)

thats a misunderstanding. That website is only for the bootstrap phase. Pools should publish their endpoints for receiving transactions after that. Also this system is needed only in the state of war. Moot point.


not really. They still have the blockchain for that. Also pools could publish how much they have in dark mempools. Also they already have such mempools. Also this system is needed only in the state of war. Moot point.


not really. If the 2nd block is produced before knowledge of the 1st, it would be orphaned anyway. If its produced after, you strip the conflicting txsn. This is nothing new. There are conflicting txns in the mempools all the time.
