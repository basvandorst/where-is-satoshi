Well,.. its a “problem” for certain “old money” types. :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:34:19


This is effectively impossible. Like encryption (or mp3-trading or bit-torrent or Tor or any number of other distributed technologies).
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:09:08
How are they gonna do that if it's decentralized?... Seems to me that would as successful as how they stopped mp3-trading, bit-torrent or TOR. (IE = they didn't/cant). 
The thing is though.. it's not just about Bitcoin in isolation. It's crypto-currencies and blockchain in all their diverse forms. The manifestations we have now may not be the final forms.. but the advantages of digital currencies (encryption, decentralization,etc) cannot be fought against. They will win eventually. I'm not sure what form they will be when they win.. but they will.

No middleman. 
A person with Bitcoins is able to buy/sell/exchange anything, anywhere for any reason that they see fit. No governing body. No Banks. No credit-rejection. No nothing. 
It's secure and reliable and eliminates a big chunk of the "middleman" problem. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:57:14


Bitcoin has the ability to leverage 3rd party "trusts",etc just like other exchanges... It's probably not done widespread just yet.. but it is possible/feasible. 


Doesn't that make PayPal the "middleman"... ?... :) ... (or maybe I'm being ignorant).. But with Bitcoin, it's direct. 1-to-1. From my wallet to yours. There's literally no middleman. 
If I wanted to send a friend in Syria a large amount... say $20,000 .... I could do that with Bitcoin. I'm pretty sure if I did that PayPal. .they'd flag it as "suspicious" or "related to terrorism" or some other bullshit reason freeze the funds. With Bitcoin, you don't have that risk. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:16:08
I disagree. The biggest strength of Bitcoin isn't the financial aspect... it's the blockchain aspect. Blockchain goes way beyond money. Blockchain can be used as a consensus/validation type of voting on pretty much any sort of community issue. The financial aspect is nice.. but that's just 1 color in the rainbow. Blockchain underpins all of that.. and creates the potential to change quite a few things. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 01:05:35
Well.. Governments shouldn't be in the business of "controlling the flow of money". But Governments want to preserve their own power.. and 1 of the ways to do that is to control money... so ... )
But the whole Bitcoin thing is gonna happen whether Governments like it or not. It's just a matter of time. It may not be "Bitcoin" as we know it today.. but it's still gonna happen. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 00:23:11
If those benefits are attractive to merchants/producers... why do you think they wouldn't be attractive to consumers/end-users ?... 
Lets say my cousin in France is on vacation and calls me up needing $200 .... w/ Bitcoin.. I could send him/her that without even getting out of bed. And it would be instant. And secure. I may be naively ignorant.. but are there any other methods currently available that accomplish the same ?
@_date: 2017-02-20 18:57:39
Here's my take on it,.. (and I fully encourage anyone to educate me if they think I'm completely utterly off-base/wrong). 
There are a lot of financial institutions and big companies experimenting with Blockchain,.. but because of the way Blockchain works (being in many ways similar to BitTorrent or Tor,etc)... I believe it's exceedingly difficult for "big business" to adapt/adopt Bitcoin to accomplish their greedy business goals. 
Bitcoin and Blockchain.. at it's very basic, foundational level.. is engineered to be transparent and anonymous and fair to everyone equally. Those ideologies often come into direct conflict with "big business" and/or financial trading/market houses that want to find ways to exploit Blockchain to their advantage. 
Look at Bit Torrent as an example. It's an exceedingly spectacular technology... but really only adopted strongly by open-source or other non-profit organizations. You won't see big companies like Microsoft distributing new versions of Windows through Torrent links. Why?.. because they can't control that. Windows 10 for example has it's own internal (proprietary) "mesh" sharing/distribution mechanism. 
So I think that's the fundamental struggle you're seeing with Bitcoin and Blockchain right now. People who want to use it for simple/basic/ethical/ reasons... are using it. Businesses who want to somehow exploit it for profit reasons --- are still trying to figure out how to do that. (and are struggling against the fundamental problem that bitcoin and blockchain were never designed or intended to give 1 individual or group power or advantage over another).

Dang,.. and I was just thinking of spinning up my own full node. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:37:25
I'm pretty small time (only have about US $250 in Bitcoin).. but for me, it's not really about "the price it's at". I buy when I want to. I sell when I want to. Some weeks/months I don't have any extra money to buy Bitcoins. Other months I do. I'm just an average person doing it for average reasons. Nothing complex. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:01:15
No matter what device/platform you use,.. its absolutely horrible OPSEC to only keep your bitcoins/wallet on 1 device/location.

* Artist: unknown
* Judge Magazine - Volume 17,  (Judge was a weekly satirical magazine published in the United States from 1881 to 1947. It was launched by artists who had seceded from its rival Puck. The founders included cartoonist James Albert Wales, dime novels publisher Frank Tousey and author George H. Jessop. Under the editorial leadership of Isaac Gregory, 1886–1901, Judge allied with the Republican Party and supported the candidacy of William McKinley largely through the cartoons of cartoonists Victor Gillam and Grant E. Hamilton. Circulation for Judge was about 85,000 in the 1890s. By the 1900s, the magazine had become successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 by 1912.)
*  "**Cover** Anti-electricity cartoon. Electricity is portrayed as a spider with a cobweb of electrical wires for trapping its human victims.
On October 11, 1889 John Feeks, a Western Union lineman, was high up in the tangle of overhead electrical wires working on what were supposed to be low-voltage telegraph lines in a busy Manhattan district. As the lunchtime crowd below looked on he grabbed a nearby line that, unknown to him, had been shorted many blocks away with a high-voltage AC line. The jolt entered through his bare right hand and exited his left steel studded climbing boot. Feeks was killed almost instantly, his body falling into the tangle of wire, sparking, burning, and smoldering for the better part of an hour while a horrified crowd of thousands gathered below."

I (personally) don't buy the argument they are trying to make (that "all Coinbase users (implication) are tax-cheats"). 
That's like me saying:... "I think all dogs are viscious."

There are probably millions of worldwide people using Coinbase. How can they possibly presume that **all** of those people are tax-cheats ?...

@_date: 2015-07-21 23:26:20
@_date: 2018-03-18 21:25:07
If you're trying to argue that my use of "fluctuate" was meant to say "can only go DOWN".. then you're wrong,.. because that's emphatically NOT what "fluctuate" means. 
Fluctuate means BOTH (up and down). Something that only goes DOWN ... is, by definition, not fluctuating. Something that only goes UP is also, by definition not fluctuating. 
Fluctuate means BOTH. And I used it.. because that's what all currencies do,.. they fluctuate up and down over time. Because value (or perceived value) fluctuates as well. 
So I'm not really sure what point you're trying to make. 
Yes.. Fluctuate does include both UP and DOWN... but by definition something is only fluctuating when it goes **BOTH** up and down. If it only goes up.. or only goes down (in isolation).. then it's, by definition **NOT** fluctuating. 
@_date: 2018-03-19 11:04:20
Or,.. 3rd option:.. You’re just THAT bad at trying to clearly or succcintly state your point.
You said:.... 


Which is total 100% bullshit,.. since (when currencies are concerned) the entire fucking point is **value**.
Nobody cares if a currencies temperature changes. Nobody cares if a currencies color changes. Nobody cares if a currency gets wetter or drier. 
The only thing people care about with regard to currencies is if they go up or down in value. Or another way of saying that, would be to use the word:... fluctuate. (which, you may recall,.. is the word I used.)
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:17:05
If the money you've put into Bitcoin.. is money that you've already psychologically "written off as "lost/gone".. then what does it matter ?... 
I mean yeah.. ideally.. anyone with money (in any market) wants it to go up,.. but you shouldn't be looking at any of that as an "investment". 
@_date: 2018-03-18 18:44:04


Um.. what?... "fluctuate" does mean that something "goes up and down" (definition: "rise and fall irregularly in number or amount.")
So.. that would mean a currency would gain/lose value. Would it not ?... 


Or the perception of stability. The history of the stock market factually shows wild swings of up and down. (  ) 


Bitcoin isn't based on math ?... 
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:54:20


Can you link back directly to the specific comment where I said that ?... Because I didn't. (are you confusing my comments with jchang23's comments ?.. because it looks like you are). 
All I said was:


and you keep responding things like:


Which again.. I never said anything about "only ever increasing in value". 
So.. I'm not sure who you're arguing with ,.. because the things you're implying I said,.. I never said. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:43:05
It's to unstable ?... If you look at the trading-history of Bitcoin, BitcoinCash, Ethereum,etc.. you can pretty easily see that they all tend to follow the same pattern of peaks/valleys. That's not a great sign. It usually means big players with a lot of Bitcoin.. are trading/dumping in unison to "pump and dump". 
If Bitcoin was really being used "by the common man" as a currency.. you wouldn't see all of those cryptocurrencies following the same pattern of peaks/valleys. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:59:16


I think things are a bit more polarized now (or at least it sure seems that way).. and largely that perception is driven by how effectively different groups use social-media and the Internet to try to drive a certain "narrative". 
I think if you ask the average-joe on the street,.. the vast majority of people are just trying to keep their head down, pay their bills.. and survive. (I personally do things where I can (joined the ACLU, am a member of the EFF, donate money to local food-banks and etc)... and try to keep myself as aware/educated as I can about local (and Federal) issues that might effect me. 
I don't necessarily think people want "big government",.. I think there's just a wide diversity of people who all want different things:
* Disabled or at-risk people.. want more services that benefit them. 
* Parents want more services/money going into schools. 
* Veterans want more services/money going into Military Hospitals and Retirement
* Culture and Arts people want more services/money going into culture and arts related things. 
* People who depend on public-transport.. want more services/money going into that. 
So you have this "being stretched in all directions" problem... where Government is expected to "do everything for everybody".. which really isn't a realistic expectation. 
And that dynamic is what fuels disagreements about Gov-spending/budgets and which programs we should fund and which programs end up getting scaled back. 
A certain % of people believe in "as little Gov as possible".. but they also don't understand that the O&amp;M (basic "Operations &amp; Management") of foundational services (Police, Fire, Roads, Water, Electricity).. is always growing and getting more diverse.. because the population is always growing and getting more diverse. 
I'm 44yrs old... so I probably skew a little older than the typical Reddit demographic. I certainly don't want to see "big government".. and I definitely don't want to see "wasteful government". 
However I do think with all the technology and innovation and creativity in our brains.. there absolutely must be ways we can leverage technology and new ideas to provide all the things society wants.. and still be fair and sustainable and efficient. 
I don't want to sound to socialist/communistic... but it's difficult for me to mentally parse a society where we have people that live in 10million mansions on the waterfront... and people who live on skid-row sometimes in clothes stained with their own shit. That disparity is shameful I think. 
We have all the technology and resources we need to solve most of the problems we already face. Hell.. we've probably had that for decades now. The problem isn't lack of resources.. the problem is our acceptance of ignorance and shameful behavior. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:46:31


The problem with this logic.. is you're making a broad sweeping generalization about organizations that's not 100%/universally true. 
* There are examples of Governmental-organizations and private-organizations.. that do amazing work (efficient, frugal, effective, quality,..etc)
* There are also examples of Governmental-organizations and private-organizations.. that are greedy or wasteful or harmful to the environment or just flat unethical. 
In my career.. I spent the first 15 or so years of jobs working in the private-sector.. and I've spent the most recent 10 years working for a city-gov. The city-gov I work for now -- is by far the more sustainable and efficient and more "well-rounded" in how they look at squeezing the most results out of every single nook/cranny/niche or angle of what we do. For the past 5 to 10 years... the city-gov I work in.. has been showing 2% to 3% gains in efficiency... every year.... year after year. That whole mantra of "do more with less"... and continuing to "do more with less".. and pushing harder and hard and HARDER every year to "do more with less"... is pretty much all we think about. 
Not only that.. but our entire budget is transparent and posted online for any citizen to look at.. and it's available 24/7/365. 
We've adopted a whole bunch of different Processes &amp; Policies... such as:
* the TBL ("Triple Bottom Line").. which is a way of approaching a problem to make sure that no matter how you fix it... that it's financially-sound,.. socially-fair.. and environmentally-safe. 
* we have a "Budgeting for Outcomes" philosophy.. that says whatever solutions we decide on.. must be driven by Data/facts.. and the progress and outcomes must be measurable and enforced. 
* we have various different teams (Innovation Team, Sustainability Team, etc).. that are constantly looking at various things we're doing.. and looking for ways to eliminate wastefulness and inefficiency. 
Most of the various employees and coworkers I am around.. are some of the hardest working people I've ever seen. (sacrificing days-off, volunteering, donating their own money,etc,etc)... and a big part of that is driven by the fact that we're citizens in the same community we work for. It wouldn't make any sense for us to "cheap out" on Police or Fire.. because we (individually) depend on those. It wouldn't make any sense for us to take shortcuts on Water or Power.. because we (individually) depend on those too. etc..etc...

Doesn't the value of any/all currencies fluctuate ?.... Just that most people don't pay attention to it. There's this weird psychological blind-spot with regard to traditional currencies.. that people have collectively convinced themselves they are "stable".. but they really aren't. They're even more speculative and "virtual" than Bitcoin. At least Bitcoin is based on math.

Short / honest answer:... Nobody knows. (and nobody can know).

As someone who works for a small City-Gov.. I really REALLY wish we did. Seems like it would have all kinds of advantages (not the least of which would be 0 transaction costs compared to Credit Card fees). I think it would be a huge boon,.. but not sure yet how to go about proposing it in a way that upper-management would be receptive or open-minded enough to consider it. 
I'm (mentally) working on a list of advantages.. and planning to write it up into a more official written-proposal. Problem is, Bitcoin is such a "new experiment" and the market is so volatile still... I have a hard time believing they'd take it seriously. (IE = for the volume of transactions we do.. they're not gonna want to lose 100's of $1000's of dollars (or more) as the Bitcoin market fluctuates). 
@_date: 2015-11-06 16:05:13
I guess I find myself instinctually thinking:.... Why do we care ? (who or what is causing Ups/Downs in Bitcoin value ?... ) 
In the big picture.. Bitcoin is still pretty young. It's still going through a lot of growth-phase and exploration/adoption/conflict/misunderstanding. Value-changes are normal at this point. 
Bitcoins underlying protocols/decentralized nature will work to it's advantage in the long run. The more knowledge of it spreads and the more diverse it's distribution across the globe.. the more stable and reliable it will become. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:35:27
Online-wallets (such as Coinbase, BlockChain.info,etc).... is like putting your money in a Bank. You no longer possess it. Someone else does. When your Bitcoins are stored online.. .that company could go out of business or get hacked or raided or whatever. And your Bitcoins are gone and there's probably not much you can do about it. It offers convenience.. but at a certain risk. 
If you use an offline/hardware Wallet (such as a Trezor, KeepKey... or by storing your Bitcoin Wallet on your smartphone in an App like Mycelium)... then you are in complete control of your Bitcoin Wallet (because it's stored on a physical device that you carry).... but this also has risks.. because you could lose it, or get mugged/stolen/etc. 
So both approaches have Pros / Cons. Which one is "right" for you.. is going to depend a lot on how much effort/learning/maintenance you want to do,.. and how much Bitcoin you intend to amass.

In my naivity.. I have to ask.... why is this (completely expected and designed-feature) perceived as a "problem". 
It's part of the system. It's an intrinsic component/design-element of how Bitcoin works. The only people it's a "Problem" for... are people who are in it for the wrong reasons. That's a "problem" for them... not for the rest of us.

I'm personally not terribly worried about it because:

I'm in the same situation.. .I bought (from Coinbase)  last Sunday night when the price was around US $370.

Anytime you convert 1 currency for another (CAN$ into Bitcoin... or Bitcoin into CAN$,etc).. you're going to have to pay fees. Because currencies have different values.. and it takes some skill/effort/etc to convert &amp; exchange. 
If you have Bitcoin.. and you keep all of your transactions INSIDE the Bitcoin market (for example.. buying something on Overstock with Bitcoins).. .then it's way easy... because you're never converting/exchanging. (You're expecting the Vendors/Merchants to handle that end of it).

Yeah.. I'm waiting for US $100 transfer to come through to my Coinbase account.. and then I'm probably going to offer/gift it out to friends/coworkers who are interested. I think "seeing it in action" is the best practical convincing. 
@_date: 2015-11-27 00:42:42
The short answer (as many have chimed in):... Nobody knows. (and it's pretty much impossible to predict). 
Whether or not Bitcoin "trends upward in value" is going to depend on a wide range of factors.. not the least of which is more and more widespread usage by more and more people getting involved in Bitcoin. (IE = like any technology.. it has to hit a certain threshold of activity to "snowball" into something bigger and more permanent). 
I wish I had gotten into Bitcoin years ago.. but I didn't. But I have some now (about 0.8 Bitcoin or roughly $282~ish US Dollars). I try not to view it as an investment. In a perfect world.. I'd like to have around US $1000 in Bitcoin.. so that if it does every shoot up (lets say: 10x value).. I most certainly would cash-out and pay off some debt/bills/etc. I don't think it's going to spike that high/that fast.. so as it stands, I'm content to hold onto what I have in Bitcoin now.. and contribute a little more into it each month.

Nope. Wouldn't dream of it. I constantly tell myself:

Banks could still fill that role,.. they just wouldn't be the ONLY ones who could fill that role. Bitcoin (and more specifically, the Blockchain) enables the ability to have "smart contracts". So for example you could do something quasi-Kickstarter that says:... If User-X does tasks (or meets goals) A/B/C on D/E/F timeline.. we'll automatically transfer them G/H/I amount of Bitcoins". You could so that in reverse.. and say:... "If User-X makes monthly payments of Y/Z/etc on -time.. then Software/Application/Service remains viable, otherwise reduce by X-%,etc) 


Don't know. Hard to say (even harder to predict). The one nice thing about Bitcoin though.. is there's no intermediary. So if someone in a 1st world nation wants to INSTANTLY send funds to someone in a 3rd world location.. they can. Almost effortlessly. So it would be advantageous for a 3rd world city/bank to adopt Bitcoin and encourage all local markets to do the same. 


Consistent / steady / stable growth ?...

And I would agree with that. Simple 1 sentence. When the linked-article takes 25+ paragraphs to say the same thing. It's fluff. 
Bitcoin ATM's can be made great by anyone. Corporate/wall-street aren't the only ones working on this.. and aren't the only ones who can make it happen.

Maybe I'm interpreting this article wrong.. but it reads like a corporate boilerplate fluff-piece. It seems to be saying:... "Bitcoin ATM's haven't been implemented in ways that benefit their corporate-masters." (or at least that seems to me what he's saying). 
Well no shit. Bitcoin is decentralized and not beholden to pumping money into "transaction companies". Those "transaction companies" don't have some inherent right to exist. (IE = it's not Bitcoins responsibility to make sure "transaction companies" continue to survive.) 
While I think it's true... that Bitcoin ATM's need improvement... they need to be improved in ways that transparently benefit the people at the bottom.. not the people at the top.

While this is all great and sensible/sobering advice (and advice everyone should read).... I'm still going to actively advocate Bitcoin (in a calm and rational way).. because I think the benefits of it outweigh the drawbacks. (as compared to traditional money)

I bought 0.4 when it was around $330 .. and I bought another 0.4 when it was around $400 ... so I made a little money on the 1st purchase.. and lost about the same amount on the 2nd purchase (because Bitcoin fell back down to around $300 about a week later). It's now sitting around $350 or so ... 
If it ever dives down to $100 or under.. I'll probably buy a lot. If it continues to slowly/steadily climb.. I'll probably continue buying in $100 or $200 increments each month and slowly build my Bitcoin wallet. 
I'd love (at some point) to be able to go about my daily routine just using Bitcoins.... not sure if that will happen any time soon (Unless I buy the Coinbase "Swift" card)...

If you're a beginner,.. you shouldn't be viewing Bitcoin as an "investment strategy". If you're interested in Bitcoin.. then by all means start learning,.. but a small amount $20 or something.. and get into it as a hobby/interest. But it's not gonna make you rich overnight.

How do services exist if theres no Gov...?
 If I’m reading correctly, the longest Gov shutdown was 21days. What happens if that becomes 1.5 months?.... 3 months?... 6 months?... 1 year?... 
Even at 21 days,.. you’re starting to throw schedules off and put major projects behind. Workers depend on expected paychecks.

That thinking comes from the fact that digital-inertia (and technology-evolution) sometimes cannot be stopped. 
* Governments and big-business couldn't stop MP3's or file-trading. They were forced to adapt to it. 
* Governments and big-business couldn't stop things like Torrents.. they were forced to adapt to it. 
* Governments and big-business can't stop things like Encryption (because it's just math.. and you can't really stop/outlaw "math"). They are being forced to adapt to it. 
Etc..etc... 
Bitcoin and Blockchain are seen as a very similar manifestation of that. Since Bitcoin and Blockchain are distributed nodes with no central control.. there's really no physically easy way to nullify that. There are to many crypto-currencies.. running on to many computers and it's to easy to setup. 
In order to stop that.. you'd have to go full on fascism and shut down an entire country (and yes. .that still does happen occasionally in places like the Middle East,etc.. where countries only have 1 or 2 uplinks or it's easy to block DNS,etc)
But that's unlikely to happen in 1st world countries. There's just simply to many available connectivity options. Remember places like the USA are the 5th largest (geographically) country in the world. .with the single largest and most complex fiber-optic network of anywhere in the world. Good luck shutting that down. 
Bitcoin and blockchain haven't been around very long (10 years?) ... so it's a relatively new technology still. If you think about where other technologies were in their 1st 10 years (and how they were mercilessly mocked).. but yet they continued evolving and changed the world. 
I think it's foolish to poo-poo something as "it'll never work" and "ha ha, that's useless".. because the moment you start doing that.. you are intentionally turning your back and blinding yourself to how it might unexpectedly change/evolve. (and with as fast as things are changing and evolving in 2018.. that's a very bad strategy)

Governments cant shutdown bitcoin.
