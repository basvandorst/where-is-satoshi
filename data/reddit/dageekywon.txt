Problems?  No.  They will however follow IRS rules regarding the reporting of transactions.
They won't cause you any problems at all.  They will report it happily to them and provide you a statement showing same.

Agreed, or the code word/pin that I put into the account information when I created the account.  Either or.
For any account access:  Deposit, withdraw, inquiry, etc.

First off, yes, you should diversify with banks if you're keeping that kind of money in them.  Just because they insure up to 250k (single) or 500k, doesn't mean you should push those limits.
Secondly, I bank with a local credit union, have a good amount of money in there with them, and any "investment accounts" through them that I have are diversified as well.  Its just common sense.  You don't put all of your money into one thing, and you don't keep all your eggs in one basket either.
Thirdly I really wonder what you're doing, because I move money around on a fairly regular basis to keep stuff diversified, adding to my investments as I go throughout the year or as needed, etc.
My money is you are doing things to try to circumvent tax reporting, like keeping transfers right under the limit, etc, to try to avoid IRS intervention.  That kind of stuff is the kind of stuff banks don't like, and if you do enough of it, they will do what they are doing to you, after warning you a few times about it.
I think there is a lot more to this story than you're telling, and I don't blame you for not telling it completely on here, but there has to be more to it.
I buy bitcoin on a regular basis when the price is at a level I feel makes it a good investment, and I've never had an issue.
I also own half of a small business and we periodically make large purchases/deposits and similar.  Same bank, never a problem.
Something else is going on here, has to be.  I never have problems because I don't try to hide anything, I keep receipts, and in the case of BTC, when I buy it, I move it to paper wallets and keep them as proof that I'm still "holding" the money.  If I sell, I keep paperwork on it, and I pay taxes on it.  Banks report everything, and thus you should have a paper trail on any investment-including BTC, to cover yourself.  And when you owe penance because you made money, you PAY IT, you don't try to get fancy, cute, or follow some advice online to try to avoid the tax man.  Unless, of course, you want them to fine you into oblivion.  They do, after all, know what you do make, even if you try to be slick and hide some of it....
I got the heck out of Wells as soon as my investments there matured, btw.  I wouldn't touch BOA with a 10 foot pole either.  Sounds like I may need to reconsider some of the stuff I have in Chase.  Which is too bad-I really do like having stuff spread out as much as possible in case someone implodes...

How do you hold on?  Just like any other long term investment.  You commit to not sell and you don't.
If your needs change or the situation changes, then you re-evaluate.  Same as what you would do if some stock you owned went good or bad, even though you intended to hold if for a very long time.
Just keep in mind that with any sale, capital gains will apply, and you best pay your taxes on it, or it will come back to bite you in the ass, and hard.  If you think your local tax authority isn't going to notice you suddenly have the money to pay off a good portion of your home note, think again.
Consider all factors before you make a decision.  And make sure whatever you do, you back it up with a paper trail, and if you feel over your head, you contact a professional (someone who is willing to sign your tax return alongside of you) for assistance.

If you want to leave it behind, sell what you have and stop using it.  If you're not comfortable with it, then you shouldn't utilize it, that simple.
That is about all you can do.  Then it belongs to them, and someone can start something different.
But we all see how well that's gone :)

If you did trades through an exchange, they should hopefully have records.
If you didn't keep them, that is your fault, and expect repercussions, that doesn't just apply to Bitcoin.
I'd suggest talking to someone who knows more about taxes than relying on Reddit as well.  If you don't have an accountant, you might want to get one.
Seriously though if you don't keep records, then you probably shouldn't be doing investing of any kind.  Unless you like paying fines and penalties to the government.

Mistakes are the responsibility of the taxholder.
Would they take it all?  Depends on the severity of the mistake.
From what I've heard, most "mistakes" are fixed by you paying the difference, then they charge you that amount again as a penalty.
Kind of like taking money out of a 401k without having a valid reason...Its taxable, then they take another 10% as a penalty for doing so.
It really comes down to the judgement of the auditor, or, if its a major amount and you contest it, the judge or whomever you appear in front of regarding it.
I pay my penance and my accountant only deducts things he has a piece of paper for.  Its not a game you want to try to play.  The computers will pick up "errors" and you usually always lose.
@_date: 2017-01-16 19:25:57
Keep ALL of your paperwork.  Your transactions will likely be reported, not only by coinbase but by your bank.
The ones you sold this year will be on next years taxes.  Make sure you have proof of the purchase price as well as the selling price, as the difference is what you gained.
If you get audited, you'll need that information to substantiate what you put on your tax forms.
You should honestly get in the habit of saving everything anyway when it comes to any investments, purchasing or selling, including statements.  Computers can and will fail, and sometimes typos happen.  Be careful with online trading for sure.  I do it a lot, have dyslexia, and make very sure of what numbers I'm putting in before selling or buying, for sure.
Don't rely on the broker to provide forms.  It is still your responsibility (or the responsibility of your accountant, if you're doing a lot of it, I'd highly suggest one, I use one for sure!) to report it properly.  When it comes to taxes, you are ultimately responsible to report anything that needs to be reported.  Do NOT rely on anyone else to do this for you, even though under law they may be required to.  And when/if you do get such forms, use your paperwork to make sure its right-errors are quite common.  You should do the same with the W2 you get from your employer every year.  Though most are generated by computer, mistakes do happen do to improper withholding and similar.
My accountant makes me save everything-receipts, etc.  It all goes into a small box, he (well one of his assistants) goes through it and determines what can be used on taxes for any purpose, including deductions and similar.  Any accountant willing to do deductions without paperwork to back it up is not a good one, either.
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:39:17
Exactly.  And you're probably right about the weed growing, I have a neighbor who is into Biotech too, you can smell it over the Dairy a mile down the road nowadays unless the wind shifts it away.
Just wonder how much the local constable takes to "license" these "firms."
But yeah, its pretty dang obvious if you're blowing through banks you have an issue, and its probably not the bank.  Its kind of like your car breaking down and you get another and it does the same thing in a few months.  You really start wondering if its the car....or perhaps you're ABUSING THE SYSTEM, which is exactly what I think is happening here.
But I guess he can keep spinning it as much as he can....

It doesn't cost Visa or Mastercard or others nearly that much either, yet they take it from merchants all the time.
You want to do it, you pays the price.
Kinda handy how credit card companies make money both at the merchant and user end...unless you pay it off every month, of course...
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:11:09
Yes, but as it climbs, 15% doesn't look too bad.
Especially if you look at it from the aspect that its not your initial investment that is being hit, but only money you have gained.
Sometimes you have to take the hit to be legal.  Its better to lose 15% than 100%.  I don't like paying 33% taxes (across the board, not just federal) a year out of what I earn, but its part of owning a small business and making what I make.
33% is better than them taking it all for messing with numbers to try to evade a few percent.
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:49:00
I did my initial purchase in a lump sum, but I did it back when it was in the $50 range for 100 btc.  I had to notify my bank prior.
Nowadays when I buy (its too high right now) I get it in smaller portions than my initial buy so I don't have any issues.
When I do it though, I move it off the exchange to a paper wallet ASAP for sure....
@_date: 2017-01-04 21:07:38
Legally, yes.  Many people involved in the drug trade were not busted for selling or purchasing, but by not properly paying taxes on the gains involved. :)

Considering that they are the only major game in town right now, good luck with that.
There are others, but probably not as trustworthy.

Keep in mind that you pay capital gains tax on what you sell, but you also have to watch your income level.  If it rises, significantly, you might see things there as well.
Keep meticulous records of your purchases so you can prove you're still holding them if asked.  I'd suggest printing to paper and keeping that somewhere.  Don't rely on technology to prove this, and you shouldn't be keeping stuff on exchanges anyway.
You don't have to show them the private keys or anything, but backing up each transaction with paper will save you a lot of pain later.  You should be doing this anyway, honestly.  Its better to have way too much than not enough when it comes to questions being asked.
@_date: 2017-01-11 19:23:56
Probably because people invested and lost their shirt, then went crying to the authorities.
They didn't understand it was not an insured investment, like bank accounts are here and similar.
The same thing happened in the USA a few years ago with the Mortgage crisis.  People signed for loans that they didn't read or qualify for, then they lost their homes and went crying to the authorities.  They didn't get them back, but the banks did get slapped (and had to get bailed out as well, remember that!).
Basically I'm guessing people bought in, lost money probably due to some kind of manipulation or insider trading, and now they are upset because they lost their life savings, and so they screamed to the government about it.  Wouldn't be surprised if the lack of proper taxes being paid on profits garnered by some of those who were on the winning side of the trades being involved in it as well.
Someone was very, very bad and now they are checking into it.  Probably has nothing to do with Bitcoin except for the fact they started with a little bit of money bought Bitcoin, and they sold and have a lot more money, and the government didn't get their cut of the profit.
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:46:50
Or, alternatively....if you lose any money dealing with it, you're on your own, basically!
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:06:37
No, but why would Coinbase not see that and realize they have an easy moneymaker right there?
My point wasn't that it was a credit card transaction, but the point that those kind of fees are charged in a lot of places, and you have two choices...pay up, or don't do it.
Just like Arco charges a transaction fee for every DEBIT card purchase as well.  If you can get away with it, why not?
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:02:05
Yes I do, but unfortunately all of my creditors and similar prefer USD.
Probably why me and many others use it as an investment vehicle, not to make payments with.

Just keep documentation supporting the fact you own the BTC.  
Once you sell that is when tax liability will come into play (assuming profit) or the ability to deduct it as a loss (if you lose money).
My accountant treats it like any other investment, and I document the heck out of everything, so the IRS would easily know I own 100 BTC that I purchased eons ago if they asked.
@_date: 2016-12-20 16:52:08

Sure, it would be difficult to explain, but the way I see it, if it comes down to that, I'll just sell my Bitcoin and be out of it then.  If its too much hassle, I won't bother with it.
Honestly, I'd think as long as you keep a paper trail just like you do with anything else and you pay your penance, you'll be fine.  Its the ones that don't...that's where the fines are.  Doesn't take much investigation or processing time to handle those kind of cases.  
The people who actually bother to document would cost too much money in investigative time.

If you have given the money to an exchange, they are holding it, not your bank.
Do your transactions and pull the money off.  Any exchange that saves your bank info...keep an eye on those accounts.  Probably why I have an account that I move money to for internet purchases and similar.  They get the info, they might get a hundred bucks.
You'd think that seeing all the posts on here regarding exchanges would answer this question.
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:05:45
You'd be even more jealous if you found out what I paid for them.  But yeah, with $1000 looming...I'm really tempted to cash out my investment, though I know the capital gains tax is going to hurt.

Yep.  And Pigs could fly tomorrow.  You never know, really.
@_date: 2016-12-15 19:07:14
Oh, you mean those same accounts where people used BANKS to make their transactions with?
Surely BANKS report NOTHING to the IRS, nor keep accurate records of ANYTHING.
All of this fear is laughable.  You're worried about a website that probably does 95% of its transactions through institutions that have reported to the IRS since its inception to make said transactions?
Hint:  The IRS already knows, they just haven't chosen to nail people to the wall yet.  You want to be dishonest, toss those dice.  I have been reporting my Bitcoin profit or loss to them for years.  I'd rather pay a bit of tax than lose everything I own and possess because of it.
@_date: 2016-12-14 21:10:49
For $100, no worries.
Its when its over $600 that stuff starts coming into play.
Although I know you don't want to pay an accountant, you honestly need to talk to one.  The advice on here will likely be to not report it, which if you're talking larger amounts....well if you want to roll those dice, you go right ahead.
But honestly, you need a tax professional if you're exceeding $600.
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:38:21
It will confirm what the banks have already reported to them, basically.
Unless you're going to coinbase with cash, or somehow using prepaid cards to purchase, any transactions with them are visible bank side too.
You do know banks do that, right?  They...keep records of stuff and if the IRS comes calling they provide it.  Its part of what they do and what you agree to when you sign up for an account/credit card/etc.
@_date: 2016-12-15 18:06:49

Surprised it took them that long.  Most of them have been doing that for years.  
The only way to try to make money at a bank nowadays is by tying your money up in a CD for 5 years or more.  And even then you'll be happy if you see .03 or better.
Better than 0, I suppose.  I only leave some money in the bank because it eliminates them charging me fees for anything.
@_date: 2016-12-07 01:05:51
No, it won't.
If anything the IRS is going to be making more money on Tax Evasion fines with the way people around here just choose to not report anything to them.
For small amounts, sure, you might get away with it, but if you are making tens of thousands of dollars "vanish" by hiding it this way, you're probably going to find out the hard way.
Remember, you gotta have Fiat to buy it first, and that Fiat is probably sitting in a bank somewhere.
Good luck to all of you who choose to try to do this and think you're pulling one over on them.  The same thing happened with offshore accounts.  They found a way, and they nailed people to the wall who did it.

@_date: 2016-12-01 21:52:38
I think people (including myself) would just take measures to hide the fact we possessed it.
Sure I couldn't spend it here, but I bought some years ago and I'm holding onto it as an investment.  I'd be screwed in the sense I wouldn't be able to cash out if it suddenly totally tanked, but otherwise I don't intend to for 4+ years.  
Sure the "authorities" could see I bought some years ago, but hey, I sold/used that up years ago as well *WINK WINK*

Trump won because the media said Clinton was going to win, so a lot of Democrats didn't vote.

Yep, and others are much less.  Part of being successful, I guess.  I do use infrastructure, as well.  
I'd rather pay less, but its the way the system is, if I owned Bitcoin or not.
Could be worse.  Could live in Russia, where I'd have to pay bribes to keep my business going, and you never know when they could decide to go back to the ways of the USSR and turn my business into a State operation, I could live in Europe where the rate would be higher (but I guess I'd get free healthcare) or whatever.

@_date: 2016-12-15 19:38:36
How did you fund said purchases?
If you used a bank, bank card, or similar, don't worry, your purchases are likely reported anyway.  Banks report to the IRS religiously.
All Coinbase will do if their records get sent to the IRS is verify their accounting.  
In other words, they already know, and have for a long time.
Which is why I have reported my Bitcoin transactions just like any other investment for years on my taxes.  
Good luck hiding from the IRS unless you're doing stuff on a cash only basis, both buying and selling.

That would be a question for a tax professional.  Being that I'm not, I have my accountant handle that.

@_date: 2016-12-02 19:29:19
Exactly.  If you actually sell them, you document it and you report it.  The same as anything else you do in the same regard.  Right?
If you buy then move them to a paper wallet or whatever, then you keep a paper record of it.  If it is questioned, you can show the proper authorities that you still possess said BTC, because you have the paperwork.
Which you do keep, right?  If you aren't and you're blaming Coinbase, then you're asking for IRS trouble.
My accountant has me keep EVERYTHING.  EVERY RECEIPT.  You don't decide what should and shouldn't be kept.  That is the job of your tax person or accountant.  If you do it yourself, you should probably do that anyway.  Why?  Because the tax code says it is YOUR responsibility!
If you get audited, the bottom line is that you are supposed to have the paperwork that proves (or doesn't prove) that you have a tax liability.  Yes, banks and similar institutions provide you with forms, but a place like Coinbase isn't regulated like that.  Which means when it comes down to it, its your responsibility.
Best read the tax laws correctly people.  When it comes down to taxes and liability and similar, the laws state quite clearly that it is up to you to keep records of such things, to prove or disprove liability.  Even if Coinbase does turn stuff over to the IRS, its your documentation that will bear fruit in an audit.
If you don't have it, that is your fault and your fault alone.  That is the way it works.  And if you don't have it, then the IRS determines it.  And guess what, they will always determine that it was unreported income, profit, etc..and they will collect accordingly.
Along with a nice "fine" to reinforce the fact you should have reported it, and kept the proper records.
DOCUMENT EVERYTHING.  By doing so, you have proof of what you did.  
Of course if you're doing things like hiding stuff...then that is also on you.  If you want to roll those dice its your bet, not mine.  Me, I don't mess with the IRS.  They and other local taxes take a solid third of my income every year.  That, to me, is more than enough.  I'm not going to compound that with fines and penalties.  I report everything.  If you don't....that's on you.

Move it off once you have completed it.
There is plenty of prior history showing that when exchanges get hacked or just decide to call it a day, that is what happens.  Someone gets it, and its not you.

Well then good for him.  That to me would be a pain in the ass.
Hopefully he has a way to get fiat back if needed in the same format.
For me it wouldn't work since I use it as an investment vehicle and buy some every month or so, depending on how the price has gone, with the intent to hold for long term (though I do monitor and sell before I lose my shirt as well, if there is a major correction).
Thus my accountant reports profit or loss on same, and I keep records of my transactions to prove what I have purchased and held versus sold for profit or loss.

My holiday season table consists of people older than me, who use technology to send emoji and texts, and have just started getting used to stuff like the starbucks app.

$200 won't raise the IRS's eyebrows.
Over $600, you're technically supposed to report it.
You get into much larger figures than that....you're playing with fire by not.  But that's up to you.  Its your ass, not mine.
Me personally, when I sell mine, if there is a gain, I will be reporting it.

You'd be surprised what the IRS can see.  How did you purchase them?  Through a bank account?  Hmm.  They don't keep any records at all, do they?
I'd be more worried about the records a bank keeps than some website on the internet that can...oops, accidentally lost all of our logs due to a hard disk failure.  A bank would be raked over the coals for losing any records and needs to keep backups.

Its all the regular ones like bitvisitor, et al.  Its just that I hit a list of them every day.  (Basically I have "Morning Coffee" installed on Firefox and when I get bored I open it, it opens all the sites (about 10 of them) and I just paste in my address, type the captcha, etc.  Usually adds up to about .008 when its all said and done.)
When I'm on my home computer I could give you a list, but they are pretty well publicized honestly.  You don't get a lot out of each site, but added together it sounds like I get more than if I mined, was my point.  Its not something I do on a regular basis, but like I said, if I'm bored for a bit.

It looks like 13 may be the peak for the moment.  Its fluctuating around 12.40 this morning with a high of 12.60.  So the climb has slowed.
Course, it did that a few days ago then shot up a bit again.  May just not be any major trades going on at the moment.
Will be interesting to see how much it affects everything-including the sites that give out free mBTC, if they will halve their rewards or keep them the way they are....

First I've heard of this and I've been in the group for a while.
Thanks for the thread, now I learned something new today :)
@_date: 2012-12-09 19:36:15
I make more bitcoin by hitting free sites daily when I'm bored, usually .008 or so just by cutting and pasting addresses and typing captchas for about 15 minutes.
I tried mining and it took weeks to get .01.  I don't do it every day, but when I'm bored I just click around and get some free pretty quick.
Though it seems with the "cut" in mining rewards now, some of the free sites are giving away less.
But if you have a list of them you can actually make about a penny a day.  Totally amazing.  Like I said.  I just do it when I'm bored with nothing else to do.
But better than burning watts and video cards up, and from seeing what you've said, a better return rate....
@_date: 2012-12-09 19:28:33
Of course it is.  Its just like sending someone money in USD and they refuse to give it back.
And actually probably will wind up happening more with Bitcoin in the future since there isn't any chargebacks.  If you get scammed, the money will simply be gone, and its likely the person will have taken it, moved it to another address, and sold it before you even realize it.
Sure they can trace it, but by DESIGN there are no chargebacks....so you're done.
@_date: 2012-12-29 21:37:36
My reasoning is that there is nothing really holding it where it is right now besides the block halving and some people slowly selling them off and stopping mining.
Once the new miners hit and the profits go back up for those still left doing it, the price is going to fall a bit.
I don't see it getting below 9, I'm just thinking the price we're at right now is propped up by miners slowly selling and getting out, and the fact that until the heavier miners hit, some people will continue.
Once bots are mining and stuff, only the pools and the people willing to make the investment will be left.  Casual mining is going to be a thing of the past.
I do think also it will slowly increase in value, but there will be a good drop from the mining aspect then it will slowly rise.  But I think that will be beyond 2013 when that happens.

@_date: 2012-12-21 13:00:33
Okay, thats cool.  If you're doing it for fun, you will probably want to join a pool of some sort.  Sure, the rewards are a lot smaller, but at least if you're contributing to the group, each time they solve one you get a small bit.
If your hash rate is really low, the odds of you actually hitting a full block are a lot lower.  Not that you won't, but you'll probably find yourself mining for nothing, basically.
@_date: 2012-12-20 22:44:34
My only question would be their return policy.
Not that I don't trust them, but buying something for a few bitcoin is different than larger amounts.
I think on major purchases I might still be wary at this point.
@_date: 2012-12-09 19:24:41
It would be better off if Bitcoin came up with some kind of system as to where you could deposit funds into an address like this and release them to the other person once the transaction is completed.
But if something happens and the transaction isn't completed, it "auto kickbacks" the funds, say after 45 days.
It only took one bad experience on Ebay to prevent me from using something like that ever again, forever.
Maybe this is something that could be integrated into such a system.

@_date: 2012-12-21 00:21:26
Honestly unless you get yourself a major mining card or similar, you're not going to make much mining either at this point.
Unless you're willing to commit to the cost to get something that actually has some speed, you're likely not going to break even with any of them.  The cost to get the card and the power costs for running it 24/7 will add up quicker than any coin you manage to gather.
I would never do it without a dedicated rig.  Using a computer you use on a day to day basis is only going to shorten the life of the GPU in it most likely.
I do have both BTC and LTC wallets though, I don't think any of the other -coins are going to be worthwhile.
@_date: 2012-12-19 06:14:33
This, and any sudden market swings.
If you buy a massive amount of BTC and then try to cash it in and it dropped a dollar in value during the time you tried to make the exchange, it could be costly.
Not that it has taken massive swings like this, but its still something to consider.  On top of the fees.
@_date: 2012-12-29 21:50:53
Actually its not, it prevents the price from being artificially inflated or deflated, which, if you were a buyer, would really tick you off.
If you were a seller of course you'd be overjoyed.
Not that we need or want SEC overview, but thats what that rule is there.  Otherwise Facebook could artificially inflate their stock price right before one of the major shareholders decides to sell a few hundred thousand shares, then after that all the people who bought take the loss.
Yes we don't want oversight, but that doesn't mean its not a good rule.
@_date: 2012-11-27 04:06:15
Exactly.  People would pay $100 for a pile of dung if it wasn't their card.

Off the top of my head:  (google search should locate these for you)
(those 2 pay small but you can usually get multiple payments, but you have to view video or sites, I background them, mute the sound on the videos)
Daily bitcoins-gives .00005 a hour.  Not a lot.  But there are hourly prizes
CoinAd-same concept as above
Freedigitalmoney is another
Like I said they don't pay tons (in fact some are very small amounts) but put together they can add up to half a cent or better daily.  Most of them have a limited number of hits/pages/videos or payments daily, ie you can only get a payment every 24 hours.
Its not something I do regular, like I said.  But if boredom strikes, it doesn't take long to go on each of them and make a half penny or so.
EDIT: If I have time when I get home late I'll post the list I have.  I found them mostly by searching "free bitcoin" then looking at the pages there I found, they often crosslink to other "Free" mBTC pages as well.
@_date: 2012-12-21 00:26:16

Yep.  I tend to go on a cash only basis but have one credit card simply for the fact that if I make a purchase and it doesn't go right, I have them to try and help me.
I don't like credit cards and only use them for this purpose (and hotel room reservations since they don't like "debit" credit cards sometimes) but they do have the advantage of offering me some protection.  Not that I think they wouldn't be fair, but when the amounts start getting into the hundreds you start thinking about it more.

Oh I know.  I'm just saying that declaring a loss is fishy to the IRS, especially the larger it gets, and its best to have it very well documented.
If you don't, you may be better off not declaring it.
I know I have an accountant for this very reason, and my small business I partially own uses the same guy.  Calculating stuff like losses, depreciation and stuff like that has to be done right and has to have something behind it to prove it, because if you're wrong, they will penalize you well beyond what you saved, for sure.
There are people who overdocument, but its always better to have too much paper than not enough when it comes to things that will reduce your taxes.  Especially large losses.  Those are audit flags for sure.  But if you have them documented correctly and they are legit, they can be deducted as stated in the code.

True.  It only takes one nutbar to cause more stuff to be added to the laws.  Unfortunately.
It will be interesting to see if such uses cause more scrutiny to Bitcoin and send people to other currencies that are similar because of it.
I just hope it doesn't reach the point that anyone who is using it is instantly seen as shady, even though there are plenty of legit uses for it.
@_date: 2013-04-03 05:09:05
Yeah, but that doesn't prop it above $100.
The climbs you're seeing aren't that kind of demand.
A good 25% of it has to be people buying in to cash out.  Sure, it looks good.
But what will the casual 75% think if they suddenly take their profits?
That is where the interesting reaction will be.  I'm not saying its going to be bad, but its surely going to be interesting to see how people react.
You have people posting now about friends, family wanting to buy in.  If they buy in right now, they are buying closer to the peak.  Could it keep going?  Sure.  Hey, I'm hoping so, with what I'm holding myself.
The question is who will flinch first and when, and when they do...how will everyone around it react.  Thats what I'm waiting to see.

@_date: 2013-04-08 21:13:52
Not if they bought one when the pre-orders first started.
Lets say the first batch of boards to come out is a batch of, oh, I don't know, 1000.
Of those 1000, some reseller bought in for 100 of them.
So the boards start coming out, people start using them, and they are making money hand over fist.  All the regular GPU miners are out of the game, and its all ASIC.
Then the reseller comes out with 100 boards.  You're on the list at  or so.  The ASIC supplier has issues, delaying the next batch of 1000 a month.  They can make 1000 a month, so at  you have 6 more months to wait.
But the reseller will sell you one, right now, for only a 25% markup.
So you can buy one from them, pay 25% more, and be in the game 6 months earlier.  You cancel your order and get one, and you make up the 25% easily in the first month, and you're in the game 6 months earlier than you would have been.
Reseller walks away with a tidy 25% profit times 100 boards.
Sure there is risk, like they never deliver.  And I wouldn't do it if I was later on in the game.
But someone with vision who got in on the ground floor could turn a tidy profit simply because people are going to want those boards the moment they hit, and if they only come out in limited numbers, 25% is probably cheap.  You'd likely see markups of 50% or more.
The only way the reseller loses is if the demand drops before they can sell theirs.  Orders cancelled and they never come out?  They wait in the refund line and hope they get it back.  They get the boards later?  Worst case they sell them for low profit.
People are impatient, and if its a slow release, they could make a mint.  But hey, look at all the people buying BTC right this moment.  Could they make money?  Yes.  Could it crash?  Also yes.
Just a different type of bet being made in this case.  They are betting the boards won't come out in droves.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:43:52
I pussied out about 48 hours ago, myself.
The first fall to $200 from $240 or so didn't spook me.  But when it happened again, I first sold just enough BTC to recoup my initial investment.
Then I held for a bit, it went $250 and then to $230, then I watched it slowly fall to $200 again.  I sold the rest then.
The next day, it was $280 (at some exchanges) and I thought....crap.  
I came back a few hours later to what we all saw yesterday.  
Its nice to see it in the client, and on Blockchain.  But unless someone is willing to pay that price listed next to the amount of BTC, its worthless.
I'm a very conservative investor, and BTC never made up even a percentage point of what I have in banks.  I only have 20% in the stock market and in my 401k which is Market driven.  80% is sitting in CD's.  
I'm surprised I held out as long as I did.  But, if what happened yesterday didn't happen, I'd look like a fool and if I posted about it, people would call me a pussy.
I thought that until yesterday, myself.  But I guess I can say I stuck to my conservative beliefs.  Even if it continued to go up, I have the gains in my pocket.
I feel for those who just bought in, especially at $200 or better.  They are the ones who bought my BTC when I put it up for sale.  But then again, it went up after that, so if they sold, I helped them.  If they listened to the cries of "Hold Spartans...."
But thats what people seem to fail to grasp many times....there are people who made money.  There are a lot more who lost.  The money just doesn't magically appear.  
Its a gamble like anything.  I sweat yesterday like a lot of people.  Not because I had lost, but I was watching a lot of people do so.  Its fun to watch it climb, and its painful to watch it fall.  Even if you don't have a chip in the game anymore.  You're damned if you do, damned if you don't.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:56:21
Sure, if the price goes back up, and Gox fixes the problems, and the fixes work.
The glaring fact is that it was allowed to happen a few times, and Gox just let it ride.  Now they are suddenly being "responsible" for suspending trading?
I'm wondering if their reserve accounts got dangerously low or something.  Its odd that if you're going to take control of a market, you wait till it falls completely to hell, and you let it bounce around like that for a while, THEN you suspend trading.
I'm wondering if there was a "run on the bank" so to speak and people sold and tried to pull their money, or transfer their BTC/Fiat out and they ran out of reserves, honestly.....

This, and probably not keeping proper tax records.
Canada wants its cut on profits, just like the US.
And everywhere else in the world.  Don't think they don't know people have been making money on it.
Because legit people are reporting it.  You can't come up with names and proper tax ID numbers for major transactors, theres a problem, quick.
Exchanges are going to have to do like E-Trade.  Register an account, verify tax data, then allow them to start trading.  No trading till the information is verified.
People who want to do things on the down-low will have to get their BTC from locals or other sources.  Exchanges can't run anonymously-they will be treated just like banks.  Gotta have that proper ID for those transactions that meet taxable criteria.
Too much money moving around for the tax man to not want their cut.  One visit to Bitcoin Charts and they can see the amount of money moving around.  They go to the exchange and start asking questions, and....oops.  Can't come up with the proper data.  We'll be seizing that account until we can figure out what we're owed.

This is part of the reason I don't have a lot in Bitcoin.
I can do that with E-Trade.  On here I could lose it quick.

@_date: 2013-04-08 20:56:39
They could very well succeed if they can build something major into it that people would like to see in Bitcoin now, ie, the ability for escrow to be built in, and the ability to chargeback for say, a 4 hour period in case they accidentally send coins and didn't intend to, or send a btc to their dealer and they don't deliver, etc.
Those kind of things are what will drive the next crytocurrency, and I wouldn't be very shocked to find out that someone is already working on it with these things, or other things that will make it more difficult for the average person to lose money.
We're using the MySpace of cryptocurrency right now.  Litecoin is kind of like My Yearbook.  Someone could come up with a Facebook version with a lot of features tomorrow.  You never know.

Hmm thats kinda odd then.  But I don't use the providers you're using.
Almost like they took your money to buy the BTC and then the value went up so they decided to reverse it and hold the BTC for themselves.

I think charging defeats the purpose.  Take donations, but charging an entry fee makes it sound fishy, is what I'm saying.
You'd be better off not spending the donations, use it for the site and operation, but be open about it.

@_date: 2013-04-02 01:04:00
It is fully deductable.  But make dang well sure you have documentation to prove you did it.
Especially if its a large amount, because the odds of audit will climb.
But properly documented, provided the tax code allows for the type of transaction, it is a documented loss and may be done as such.
If you lost the money in 2013 though, then it goes on the 2013 taxes not 2012, unless it meets criteria that allows that.
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:45:34
Bitcoin should be another option that perhaps allows a slight discount if the retailer sees fit to do so, since the transaction is "instant" and doesn't come with a fee (besides the miners fee) versus credit cards.
Anyone just deciding to go purely Bitcoin though...I doubt it.  But adding it as another option is a good idea for retail sites for sure.  
I see places advertising on here only taking it, and the way I view that is that you're closing out a lot of other potential buys.  
It should be complimentary and another option, not exclusive.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:15:55
I don't buy from you because I've been burned too many times on sites like eBay.
I tend to stick to larger stores for this very reason.
A good amount of the internet at large has been burned before.
And with the inability to easily put BTC into escrow (yes you can, but it requires more hoops) its just easier for me to take my Debit/Credit card, go to my bank website, create a one time number, and order from a larger merchant.
When you and the small company you own have been burned for $500+ on online transactions, you stick with larger people.  Its nothing against you, but it only takes getting burnt once for people to go back to larger proprietors.
Its just reality-if I send you BTC, you could "forget" to send me the stuff, and I have no way of getting it back.  I could come on here and post that you're a scammer, but that doesn't get my BTC back.
I will probably try bitcoinstore for a purchase if BTC keeps rising, but thats because it appears they have a bunch of satisfied customers.
I don't have any way of rating your honesty, so I have to err on the side of caution.
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:21:47

Basically its the same as they do in California, where you are supposed to list all of your internet purchases that were not taxed properly.
If you don't do it and they audit you and can prove you were hiding something, then you get fined plus usually wind up paying a few times the amount of tax you should have paid and declared.
On the Federal level they would get you for some form of evasion.
It will be the same way they will get people who gamble with bitcoin and win-failure to pay taxes on winnings above $599, basically.
There is a reason you see all those ads and hear them on the radio about places wanting to help you "Settle back taxes" with the IRS.  Once they find out about it, they are relentless, and a bankruptcy won't get rid of them either.  They will attach everything you own.  People talk about ways they evade that kind of stuff.  Trust me, you don't want to get caught doing it.  They will find a way and the scary thing is that the burden of proof will be on you to prove you paid properly or didn't have to pay for whatever reason.
There is a reason why I pay an accountant to do my taxes and keep my books.  I'd rather pay the 33% or so I normally pay every year than take some deduction that is illegal and get caught.  It would make 33% look like nothing.
I would think they would treat it like any other investment-buying stocks, precious metals, etc.  It may not be mentioned yet in tax law, but it will be shortly.  Especially since a lot of online gambling is firing up again with it.  That will probably be the primary reason it will be looked at quicker than anyone ever anticipated.  The government doesn't mind if you gamble.  They mind if you win more than $599 and don't give them their cut.  Or you run the casino and don't give them their cut.

Provided an agreement is made in that fashion.
Taking a girl to dinner then doing that isn't illegal.
Agreeing to dinner FOR that purpose is.
Thats why when you see "stings" on TV, there are a few specific components-the act the person wants and the compensation they will give for said act, and the UC officer usually never suggests specific acts, instead allowing the john to speak up as to what they want and for what cost.
Most laws do specify that the gain does not have to be money.
That means, technically, years ago, when a girl offered me sex in exchange for me fixing her computer, it probably technically was prostitution, though we did it several other times after that without me fixing it again.  But that first time, technically, by the laws in my jurisdiction, probably would have qualified it.  I did something for her (fixing her computer) that I normally charged clients for, but in exchange accepted sex as payment.  If I had been prosecuted, they probably would have used the figure that I would have charged to fix her computer as the "compensation" I gave her in exchange for the act.
The only grey area would have been the fact she offered it to me after I fixed it, and I hadn't intended to charge her for it anyway since she was a friend of mine, but she did imply in the conversation that, besides just wanting to have sex with me, that jokingly she was paying me back for doing so (fixing her computer).  How that would stand up in court is debatable, but the way the law is worded, it would be covered by it.  The judge and jury would have to decide on if the timing made it such an act or not, the circumstances, etc.

Correct, which is what is going to happen, or Bitcoin needs to get on the ball so to speak and get moving on the issue.
The flux in value of the coin, itself is going to present itself as well as challenge to the merchant as prices will have to move with it, and policies put into place so that people buying something for 1BTC today and returning it in a week understand why they only got .95 back because the value changed also.
Either that, or people will have to be willing to absorb the changes, purchasers and vendors included, and with the swings we're seeing right now thats highly unlikely as well.

@_date: 2013-03-12 17:05:44
The problem here was twofold:  Blockchain size and limitations in one version of the software versus another.
Whats going to have to happen is some kind of agreement is going to have to be made for both.
When new software comes out, its going to somehow have to be proven good.  If this means they take it, put a test chain on it, and hammer it for a few days or weeks to make sure its good, fine.  Then, when they agree to upgrade, EVERYONE MOVES AT THE SAME TIME in the mining community.
When the blockchain is showing signs of strain, the soft/hard limit will have to be increased.  It is going to have to be monitored better.  And they are going to have to set some kind of percentage or similar to get this done at, and make the move WELL BEFORE it gets to the point that it causes an issue.  And it will have to be done without debate and whining.  Lack of capacity will NOT look good, period, to any major player considering adding that option to their payment possibilities. 
Communication worked well last night it sounds like.  Thats going to have to continue.  
This has happened twice.  Thats two strikes.  A third one will reduce confidence.  This is the first one in the public spotlight.  A second one in that spotlight will question the *core operation* of Bitcoin as a whole.
They should be commended for handling it the way they did.  But they need to *handle the basis of the problem* and monitor it into the future to ensure that it doesn't happen again.  If Bitcoin is to become a major player, it will have to have this ability.  Otherwise, there isn't a major merchant out there who is going to have confidence in them when it comes to major shopping days like Black Friday and similar.  They will demand results, not excuses.
If Bitcoin wants to be in the big time like everyone on this subreddit laments about and screams for, it needs better monitoring, it needs transaction ability adjustments as demand dictates, and it needs it now.  Not in a few months when there is a problem and a 6 hour backlog in getting stuff into the chain, etc.  Right now.  People are watching, including the media.  Its in the spotlight, and questions will be raised if its not taken care of right.  And seriously, all of this satoshidice BS needs to go away.  If Bitcoin can't handle someone using the blockchain like this, how will they handle a major player who decides to start taking them?  Sure, SD may "pollute" the chain.  But what do you think someone like Amazon would do to the chain?  Seriously?
As I said in another topic, this is Bitcoins Mulligan.  They get one.  The next one will not be taken lightly.  They have to take care of it, now.

Well of course its a conspiracy theory.  Half of this subreddit is!
I posted it as an alternative to a question that was asked.
I didn't, of course, expect people to take it as seriously as you did.
Its the same as all of the people on here who were predicting $1000USD/BTC a few weeks ago :)
The scary thing is that people are continuing to use Gox, in fact, their trade volume is constant, and the request to be verified list grows.  So, though it is conspiracy, the numbers, at least at the moment, are demonstrating no negative effect on Gox-except when people can't reach them to trade, of course.
Like I've said, why do anything about a problem when there is no problem?  My theory is because they profit either way.  It is, however, only a theory, of course.  They could totally tank tomorrow.  But today, they appear to be doing just fine :)  The graphs showing volume and the fact the list grows don't lie.
I was just speculating that Gox doesn't care because they are making money.  Its been speculation all along.

Its a great demonstration of how all of the trading houses for Bitcoin are back somewhere in the 2000's, but its 2013.
Couple that with an unregulated market and you really cannot blame people for taking advantage of it.
MtGox et al are going to have to put up or shut up now, or the value will be diminished simply because this keeps happening.  You can't be confident in BTC  when it only takes a few minutes of lag by some group or whatever to make it $100.
There are going to be a good amount of people who lost today.  Its going to affect the bottom line.
If it doesn't, then they must be gluttons for punishment.  If I was them right now, I'd be hoping for another group of suckers to drive it up so they can get out themselves.  Which is what very well may happen.

I want to say I paid .0005 like I did the rest but I could be wrong.  I honestly can't remember but that is what I recalled doing when I did this stuff.
I don't think it was multiple inputs.  It was a send from an online wallet to the wallet on one of my PC's.
I was wondering about honestly if it would ever just eventually get dropped by the client.  I wouldn't trouble someone for 4/10 of a Bitcoin, seriously.  It just seemed kind of weird.
I should mention also that I moved piddly amounts of coin from that address to the address in question plenty of times prior without any problems.

Yep, my Credit Union has done fine.  No issues with any transfers.  Not only to BTC providers but for other things, such as settlements for Real Estate transactions I have done, etc etc.
It could, however, be for other reasons as well that stuff is getting rejected.  The stigma (and simple fact) that there are gambling websites and other "grey" things going on/being funded via Bitcoin could be the reason as well, in which case the hostility may be government driven, and may very well spread to Credit Unions.
But since Credit Unions self insure accounts (at least in the US) such leverage is a bit more difficult, though usually they will fall into line with such things since they don't want to anger the regulators.
It could also be a level of rejection by the exchanges themselves, ie, transactions being taken by the exchange and not showing up in an account timely, so people call the bank to complain.  Enough of those and they just may stop doing commerce with them altogether.
I wouldn't just blame the banks at this point, with the posts I have seen on here about money not showing up, showing up a week later (and someones BTC buys being messed up because of it, etc etc).  If there are a lot of chargebacks or attempts, that could be the case also.
Especially with the crash last week.  I'm betting a bunch of people called their banks trying to get stop payments put on wire transfers when they lost money as well.  May be another reason.  Easier to not do business with someone if the complaint level gets too high.  People scream "FRAUD!" a lot also on those kind of things, enough of that and you can also just decide to not deal with it anymore.  Though obviously the people did those transactions open-eyed before the crash.

You can do that.  What I did though was get the Bitcoin client for my windows machine and I moved the coins onto there.  Then I would move stuff onto blockchain (for spending) or onto whatever exchange (for selling).
Blockchain is pretty safe, but make sure you go into settings and setup two factor authentication.  I also wouldn't put all the coins into one wallet.  Take them and divide them up a bit.  
Also make sure if you use the client on your computer that you turn wallet encryption on, and that you remember the password for that.  
You can also do what is called a paper wallet.  I never did one of these, but this is supposedly the most secure.  You can create an address (most people seem to use VanityGen) and then just record the wallet address and the security key, and then you transfer money to the wallet address.  If you want access later, you import the secure address into blockchain or similar and move the coins.  But until you put the secure address onto blockchain, only you know it-so the coins remain secure.
I never got that paranoid about it, since I run a computer company and have good antivirus and firewall etc at home, I just encrypted my wallet at home and stored stuff there, then moved coins from there as needed back and forth.

Especially if the gambling sites start getting into what the government calls "real money" and starts breaking the $600 area where you're supposed to be reporting that kind of income.
Right now some are but its not something happening time and time again constantly.  But once it starts becoming commonplace. they will see it as another source of revenue and go after it.
They aren't going to do it yet, even with BTC close to $60, it could still suddenly fall tomorrow, or the next big thing could come out, which also happens on the internet.
But they won't leave that kind of money on the table if it gets to a threshold.  Right now pursuing those who are doing it would cost more to do than what they would recoup-the moment it would be profitable, you'll see laws passed and enforcement beginning.

Oh I'm well aware of that.  I do have one credit card but I keep it paid off, mostly because I have to travel on business a time or two a year, and a lot of hotels won't take a debit/credit card.
But there are a lot of people who carry balances.  These are the people Mastercard and Visa make money on, besides the merchants who take them and let them skim a few percent off each transaction.  
My point is people who do this don't have the cash to be buying Bitcoin and thumbing their nose at Visa.  They owe them too much to be doing that.
They would be paying cash already and only using a debit card with a logo already if they were that savvy.

Even though I wonder about their backlog of verifications, I use Gox myself.
But then again Bitfloor etc isn't handy for me.  Just because of the amounts involved.
My last buy was last month when BTC was $50/BTC.  I bought 200, two transcations of 100 each.
I am verified, I'd be kinda miffed if I was in line now.  I really wonder why they haven't stepped up verification.
As for my transactions though, no problems with Gox.  But I don't leave it sitting on there either.  I made my buys and moved it off.  I'll move it back on when I decide to sell, or to another wallet if I'm buying with it.
I have heard from many people though that bitfloor is good for smaller amounts like a lot of people are saying here.

Not really.  I work 80 hour weeks, then put that money into the bank where it makes interest.
Now I agree on the loan interest, but honestly, bouncing a check or an overdraft, after the first few, seriously is an issue with the person doing it, not the banks fault.  Yeah, they charge excessively, but you don't just make those kind of mistakes more than a few times.
And since I pay 33% of my income in taxes, I'd say I'm contributing plenty, honestly.  Only the "Uber rich" have the ability to get around them.  Upper-middle class schmucks like me are lucky to be able to knock a percentage point off with deductions.  We pay, and pay well.

If you go paper, you may even want to divide that up between an address or two, just in case.
If you plan on buying stuff, leave a bit in another accessible wallet, maybe on your computer, but only maybe .5btc or so.
Don't leave them all in one place, or on one type of wallet.  You'll be safer with them on your own machine, or on paper though.  I only move money to online wallets like blockchain to spend it or move it.

Those who they can identify properly and did things by the book will get a share of the money (most likely) after penalties and fines are assessed.
Those who didn't have, or used a fake ID will never see a cent.
Provided anything is left.  When it comes to evasion and tax evasion, the fines and penalties often meet or exceed the money the plaintiff has.  The ability to pay is usually not a factor as well-they usually are able to charge with impunity.
Thats why its not a good idea to mess with the government or the tax man.  They will get their share, and if you don't give them their proper share, they will be glad to start taking what they should have got-starting at twice as much and working their way up, usually.
@_date: 2013-05-07 20:09:48
Yes, but the higher the hashrate, the more the potential exists.  Just because getting a vanity address CAN take weeks doesn't mean it does.  There would be some luck involved, but a concerted effort (especially if mining rigs get faster in multiples of 2-10 per generation) and you could see mining pools created to mine private keys instead of blockchain.  Especially if the target involved is holding a lot more than 25BTC.  
Sure right now its out of reach, but look at the computing power 10 years ago versus today.  You have to assume those kind of leaps will continue to happen.  Get a few people together who can afford the hardware or are simply sick of mining for 10BTC in a few years when there are a few more halvings, and its not impossible.

I disagree, when both were blockchain related issues.
You would think you would learn from the first lesson.
Hopefully learning happens from the second.
The same type of problem isn't a good sign.  Its a weakness and it needs to be addressed.  If it happens again, then you've got a pattern and you start to question why it keeps happening.
What I don't like about it is that the blockchain limit issue was being discussed already for a few weeks when this happened as well.
You'd think it would have been covered....

You should save.
HOWEVER with the gains you're seeing in Bitcoin now, you'd be foolish to not at least remove your initial investment.  Especially if you bought below $100.
Hoarding is fine, but if you put $500 to get into the game, unless you bought at well over $100, you should get your initial investment out.  That way, if there is a crash, correction, or whatever later....you didn't lose anything.
I saw $240 this morning and took the 10 grand I initially invested at $50 out.  So now instead of 200btc, I have 155, and my initial cost is in my pocket.  The 155btc is pure profit.
If you don't want to take it all out at once, fine.  But I would slowly take some out to remove your initial costs at least.  If you were in at under 100, thats less than 50%.  In my case, it was roughly 24%.
What I have left in there is now a purely profit vehicle.  It will sit until I get so nervous about the price my teeth are chattering and I'm sweating profusely.
But at this point, I'm even, USD wise.  I will now hoard away.  With the ~14btc in my account that I use for buying stuff.  I wish I had waited till this morning though to order from bitcoinstore (I did yesterday at 190).  Oh well.

A bank is hostile by following the rules laid out by the government?
Totally hilarious.  If they kept doing business with a potentially illegal enterprise, they would be in violation of the rules as well.
But hey, go ahead, take your money out of banks that follow the rules and put it into....MtGox.  You like unregulated "banks," there is one for you.  Wake up, all banks will eventually do this, as the fraud detection in place is triggered and they HAVE TO lest they violate the law.
I'm sure the amount of chargebacks that happened when that big crash happened contributed as well.  Once you get a bunch, the bank stops doing business with the involved party.  Thats common sense.  Which isn't too common in this subreddit lately.

Yeah but depending on the nonprofit and how they do their taxes, etc, they may not want anything external handling it.  
For all you know they may not want to pay a fee no matter how paltry it is, although I'm sure they are paying one to their CC processor.
It could also be they don't like the concept of Bitcoin, for all you know.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:48:22
No, but its not like Gox is going to not accept the trade.  3.50 is 3.50.  It would cost them more energy and CPU to scan each transaction against a limit and accept/reject.
And you just saw a few of them.  It happens on and off all day if you watch those charts, and they are sometimes for higher.  I saw a slew of .01 and .10 yesterday, for example.  They make a bit more on those.
And once they move the price up or down, whatever the intention, you'll see the large trade at the end.  Gox makes a nice amount on that one, for sure.    Plus others seeing the rise or fall and taking their position on it as well.
Enough that I'd leave it alone too.  These market drives will drive selling and buying depending on the direction.
Gox gets money from every one of them.  Get people to buy and sell in slews every day by doing these transactions, would you get rid of them?  It increases trading volume.  Why stop it?

Stocks are not legal currency either, but have value.  If you buy some and then sell, and you make money, you have created a capital gain, the amount you have gained is taxable.
Real estate is not legal currency either, but has value.  If you buy some and then sell, and you make money, you have created a capital gain, and the amount you have gained is taxable.
Do as I do and consult an accountant or tax attorney.  I'm sure they will inform you that any gains or similar are taxable.  Losses, I'm not sure of, but since it could be considered an investment, you may be able to declare also.  But I don't know how.  Thats why I have an accountant.
The way I look at it is that I'd rather pay the taxes on the gain than not, have them find out, and then go after me for that-plus penalties-plus falsification of a tax return (I didn't declare it).  They can and will do this.
Especially to people like me who make 250k a year.  They have a document right in front of them proving that not only did I make the mistake, but I have the funds to cover all the fines, fees, and other bullshit they can conjure up because I left something out.  And even if I don't, no problem.  They will garnish my wages to get it.
People talk about this and about Bitcoin as being this whole way to screw over the government.  They have never dealt with the IRS, or have never seen what they can do to people.  You're better off paying the penance.  
If you want to roll that dice, go ahead, but not many people fight the IRS and win when they purposely do things to avoid taxation, falsify a tax return, or not file at all for whatever reason they think is good.
Anyone thinking this should seriously look at what they have and what they could potentially lose before doing so.  The IRS doesn't go away and can't be gotten rid of via bankruptcy as well.
I'm sure as Bitcoin gets going more and more you'll see specific tax laws tailored to it, but until then, I wouldn't go looking to see if there is a loophole excluding it.

You shouldn't be leaving money on an online wallet anyway.  I only move BTC to blockchain long enough to send it to a mechant online.
That and I've had SMS authentication enabled since they offered.
Yubikeys look pretty but never have got one for the price.  A random code to my phone in my pocket is much cheaper and more secure, in my opinion anyway.
But you should never leave coins on an online wallet for any longer than you need to make a transaction anyway.

I should go back on, it would be the same as 12 years ago.  Except all the porn is probably on torrents now instead of DCC transfers.

I'm just saying like another responder to OP that there are better alternatives if you're just looking to store data in the cloud.
Dropbox works well for what it does, but I don't need the ability to share files with anyone other than myself.  I store things to the cloud for easy access.
And I'm sure Dropbox doesn't allow their staff to look at or mess with data, but I find the ability even being there to not be good.
Its probably why, however, that I only use cloud storage for things that I don't mind people seeing.
I just found it kind of disheartening that I bought into a service because they advertised it in a fashion that they didn't have access to your stuff.  Then suddenly without warning the AUP changes and they do.  I felt that was unfair, so I didn't renew, is all I'm saying.  I understand why they did it, it just didn't sit well with me, so I stopped supporting them with a subscription, and I didn't need it once I pulled the data off the cloud that I had on it, encrypted as well, because what I have on there now is well under the 4.0GB I get free.

Its better to protect yourself by staying within the law (even if it doesn't exist for BTC) instead of not, and then later on the government finding a loophole and deciding that you misreported taxes or illegally traded.
I've bought and sold BTC myself this year and I made about 8 grand.  Will I report it?  Yes, as misc income.
Its cheaper to pay the taxes on 8 grand than it is if someone comes along and says "Oh, whats this?  8 grand in unreported income.  I will take that, thank you, and another 8 grand since you didn't report it.  Oh, and your tax return is false, you signed a statement saying it was true and correct...lets see here, you made 250k before taxes last year, how about a 25k fine?  You can't afford it?  Sure you can, it says right here you can....."
And its not like the banks are not going to tell, especially if you're exceeding the thresholds they have for money transfers.
Better to cover yourself than to find out later that suddenly you violated some kind of law.  The exchanges also have to report profits made in trades either way (USD/BTC or the other way) because of the involvement of USD and the fees they are charging.  Sure, those fees are used to pay for the costs of doing business, but any amounts above those of course are profits, and are easily tracked as well as taxable.
People who think governments don't know whats up need to really think about it.  They may not care about your BTC holdings, but the exchanges can't hide the kind of money they are moving around.  
Or they could just try not to, and you'll see exchanges vanishing, which is what will happen.  They will always go after the major players first, and the exchanges are the ones moving the amounts the government cares about.

Correct, but people also whine about the market not being properly controlled because sites like Gox choose not to do anything about it.
Many of those very whiners exist in this very subreddit.
It seems to me that the community cannot decide.  I think they aren't doing it because they are making money on it.  I'm not saying they should at all.  I'm saying that they know its going on and they haven't done it, so they must like the free and open market.  My reasoning is because with every trade they make money.
I've said that further up in this chain, in fact.  
Can't take off what I don't have on.  I just call it like it is-people are making money off Bitcoin because its unregulated, and its not just the speculators.
Why would they want to ruin the status quo?
I'm just replying to the initial reply I made-they like it because they are making money on it.
@_date: 2013-04-27 17:35:56
They could also just decide the entire thing was fraud, and allow people to file claims for their money, and allow them to have to provide the burden of proof that such transactions were legitimate.
Being that this is the easiest way, I wouldn't be shocked if that is the way it winds up going.

There are still the free pay sites like BitVisitor.  I used to go to them daily when BTC wasn't worth much, just simply to have some coin in an account to use for paying fees.

You have to figure most companies taking it are converting it to local currency pretty quickly.
Simply because there aren't any suppliers out there taking BTC, they need the local currency to buy more stock, etc.

Its not going to destroy the term.  It will make it a bit more difficult for private trackers to be busted, but it will still be illegal.
But like in everything, there will be people who will find something like this and ruin it for everyone.
One site that comes to mind is a site that started with a C that used to carry full DVD movies of sex, AKA porn.  But it got ruined when people that had a tiff with the people running it decided to report it to some of the makers of the films that were seeded on said site.
Suddenly the site is shutdown.
And it didn't even make money-it was invite only, you had to maintain ratios to download (meaning you had to seed).  The only things you could pay for is to get yourself out of download hock, ie, if your ratio got too low, a few bucks by Paypal bought you a few gigs of seeding, so you could download again.
It will slow down the pursuit of them, will prevent their funds from being seized al-la-paypal, but there will still be shutdowns and infiltrations.
Bitcoin will just add a step to (insert moviemaker/software maker/other content provider here) being able to buy a password on said site, log actvity, and go after people.
But hey, whatever makes you feel more confident.  Its not going to slow down enforcement or anything.  It will prevent money being lost though.  
Until the government figures out how to track wallets, which if they keep passing bills to spy on stuff, won't be too hard.

Bitcoin (the protocol) may be hack resistant (I wouldn't call it "proof" till its not messed with for a long time)....
But since there are enough users of it that are new at it, or don't use good security protocols on the internet, attacking the code itself isn't needed at this point anyway.
There are plenty of suckers to be attacked by conventional, and currently available means.  No reason to have to think outside the box yet.

Just the state law.  People will often sell a vehicle with a smog certificate, and then they find out its not valid.
State law says the vehicle must pass smog to be sold, but then you have to go through all the legal trouble to get the person to take the vehicle back or make them comply.
For such a purchase I would think escrow would be a good idea anyway, but there are a lot of times people get stuck with a car they can't smog and don't know about the law.
Its the same reason why when you sell a vehicle in CA you should go online and file a release of liability the moment you sell it.  Don't trust the other person to mail it in for you.  If they don't register the car and you don't declare it, you're liable for any violations or worse.

But then again its at 60 and change at the moment, so maybe not.  Who knows, really.
I just figured what is now almost a $14 slide would garner some kind of attention in the subreddit.  I was surprised when there were no posts submitted about it, which is why I submitted.

I do run a full node, but only on my computer at home, and only when its on, which is maybe 4-6 hours a day during the week or less (when I'm home, I work a lot) and maybe 12 hours on a weekend.
It does eat the bandwidth though, so be careful.  I was pretty surprised how much sustained upload it hits sometimes.
I throttled it to 100k/sec and its not too bad now.  But it does peak out at times.  Depends on how many people are connected to me I guess. 
I thought about putting it onto a box I leave running 24/7 but it can take a lot of bandwidth I need for work stuff, which is why I throttle it.  I do have an unlimited connection, but I log into boxes remotely for work and that requires a bit of upload as well.
It seems to be perfectly happy at 100k/sec.  Would be nice if they built that into the client though, probably would encourage more people to do it if they could limit it without an external program.

Depends on how the major holders decide to play.  The moment they think its peaked and they cash in, its going to be interesting.

I hope what you're saying is true.
But anyone who bought in at over $150 has to be quite upset.
Anyone over $200.....are probably beyond upset at this point.
And with MtGox closed, those with money on it can only sit and watch.  They have to hope and pray the value of 1BTC gets back to $124, or whatever they paid.  If not, the moment Gox reopens, they fall to the going price (or gain if it happens to be higher!) and take that loss or gain fairly instantly.
If all the other exchanges are trading at $90 when they reopen, nobody is going to pay $124/BTC to anyone on Gox.  
A suspension of trading does nothing when you have other exchanges.  Its different if they all agree to suspend.  In this case, its too little, too late.  Trading goes on.
Where the people on Gox come out will depend on what the price is when they reopen-and if it goes back up or not.  If it does, then everyone is okay.  If not, they will have to sell to recoup what they can, which makes this halt a hiccup at best.
One thing is for sure.  Gox's supposed 80% (I've heard more like 50%) amount of trading of BTC is done for.  If they are lucky they may retain 30%.
Now is the time for anyone with the brains to slow mini trades of .01 to open an exchange and take some business away.  Even if Gox fixes it, the confidence level in them has hit the basement at this point.

Although I'm happy with the response overall like most, the problem needs to be addressed, and soon.
If it isn't, or stuff like this happens again, that confidence will be dashed.
This is Bitcoins Mulligan.  They now know there is a problem.  They need to move to fix it in a timely manner.  If they sit around and wait, act like java and just let the issues keep steamrolling, then they will have a problem.
This is the second time its happened (major at least).  The third strike will not be pretty.  Whatever the reasoning, whatever the excuse, it needs to be handled.  
We'll see what this does.  But a third instance will *not* look good.  They know the problem, they were reminded of it last night.  Its an issue now, everyone knows it, and they are expecting more than just this fix.  A fix will increase confidence.  A "wait and see if it happens again-we handled this and we can just do this again if it happens again" approach will not.
In my eyes it should have been handled the first time, but at this point, the issue is here, and the time is now.  They have to get it done.  No ifs, ands or buts.  It won't be acceptable again.

Tax havens are only used by those who have so much they can hide a bit and nobody notices.
To a regular schmoe like me who makes 250k a year, they have never been a thought.  The IRS would notice if half of my income suddenly vanished without me losing my job or similar.
You pay the man, or he takes it all.  Very simple.
But when governments start hurting, and hurting badly, they start looking at everyone, including those with so much money they can burn it.

Okay.  But until Gox and similar is up for a few hours and the entire world reacts I wouldn't be taking charts as gospel, is all I'm saying.

@_date: 2013-04-11 21:38:38
I would guess $25-50 right now, but it was at 90 3 hours ago and we're looking at $60 now.  So now I'd say, honestly?  $10-20.
Honestly, I think its going to go WAY down unless all the exchanges get together and do something to stop the manipulation that happened.  
And I really honestly think Gox shut down because they had liquidity issues.  They aren't saying anything, but its awfully odd that they let it bounce around as much as they did before they called trading off.  
If they announce they cannot meet their obligations, its going to fall further still.  I hope this isn't the case, but if you look at the charts and how long they waited till they finally pulled the plug, you really, really gotta wonder.  If they cared about "stability" as they stated, they would have stopped the first time it hit $120, not let it bounce up and down for a while before finally calling it a day.

Spoken like someone who doesn't understand the IRS.
I make 250k a year and have an accountant do my taxes.  Will I be reporting BTC profits (if I make any?)  Damn right!
If you don't report it and they don't find out, okay, you're golden.
But if they do....then the few hundred in penance I would have had to pay them is nothing.  Basically I falsified my tax return, which means not only am I going to pay penalties on what I didn't pay, its very possible they could get me for the falsification, and thus charge me some more "penalties" as well for that.  And seeing they already have a form in front of them that demonstrates I would have no issues paying those fines and penalties, do you think they will just "slap my hand" and call me "bad" and say "don't do it again?"
Its a heck of a lot cheaper to pay the penance than it is to pay the fines when they catch you.
But hey, go for it.  Good luck if you get caught, though.  Me personally, I'll eat the few hundred or grand to save a years pay going out the dang window because I decided to not include a few grand I made on Bitcoin.  I would lose the money I made on Bitcoin and a significant amount more.
Edit:  Bad english.
@_date: 2013-04-20 20:13:43
I'm sure the speculators would agree it works well also.
And since Gox is doing nothing about it, I'm guessing they like the transaction fees also.
Otherwise by now they would have done something about it-or announced that a solution is coming soon.
Seeing neither, I have to assume they are just fine with events as they continue to happen.
Are they feigning it?  Probably not.  But you think by now you'd be fed up with your site getting DDOS'd off the internet and you'd get some redundancy going if it was affecting your bottom line that much.
My theory is that the bottom line is being enhanced, the press is helping, thus why change?

If you seriously look at trends on twitter, they are for major events, stuff like this, or similar.

You have to follow their rules.  The way I did it was I bought Bitcoin initially, then when I did trades, I would move BTC to the appropriate exchange, sell, then either leave the money there, or withdraw it (via Gox, usually).  If I left the money there, it would be to rebuy.
But I made most of my moves in BTC.  Any cash movement meant I cashed out, or moved BTC to a wallet I controlled for holding.
But most of my moves back and forth, so to speak, were in BTC.  I'd only go to fiat to sell and then rebuy.  If I was cashing out, I'd move my funds to Gox or Bitfloor (usually) sell BTC, then withdraw from one of those two.  I actually used Gox a lot for this until they started having the lag problems.
@_date: 2013-04-16 04:48:35
It gets back to 50, I'm in for 100 BTC.
Already been telling myself that.
I made plenty back when it was at $200.
I may eat it, but the money I'll be buying with is profits from before, so its house money, either way.
Course, if its not at 50 in about an hour, I'll go to bed.  I may wind up getting it lower, if it keeps falling, or I may miss the time to buy.
I need sleep more than it :)
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:36:33
They should fix the problem, but since they make money off every trade, you can't blame them for not.
What it will come down to is people buying low and holding, or buying low and taking advantage of the speculation by selling before they start playing their games.
Since the trading places don't seem to want to solve the problem, it will have to be the community at large that solves it by costing the speculators money.
Until that happens a few times, it will keep happening.  If they can keep catching people on the wrong side of the fall and profiting from it, they will keep doing it.
If you don't want them to do it, don't fall for it.  Hold, or sell before they start to take a rise and mess with it to take their profits.  Costing them money is the only way you'll get them to stop.
Hopefully everyone will keep in mind what has happened thus far and not fall for a rise as "NOW WE'RE GOING TO 1000!" like a lot of people screamed last time.
Be careful, and like everyone said before last time and a lot of people didn't listen-only invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:40:33
What you just said totally places the blame on them.
Its an unregulated market, they should have expected this and set their fee structure accordingly, or had the hardware to handle those trades.
Its their fault for not doing either.  And its not like this trading hasn't been going on prior.  They had weekly and daily dips because of this.  They could have stopped it but they chose not to.
They are totally to blame for what happened to them.  They chose to ride the wave of fees until they couldn't handle it anymore.
This is on them, totally.  It wasn't the first time it happened.  It was however, the first time it happened on this scale.
But they had plenty of prior warning.  And now there are people sitting on their exchange with BTC they think is worth $124 and its in the 80's now, and they didn't even have a chance to sell.
Unless MtGox is going to honor that value, this stoppage is symbolic at best.  
The only logical reason I see for it is 1) they are fixing the problem, and 2) they hope the value of BTC climbs back up to $124 by the time they reopen.
If it doesn't, those people will lose a major chunk of money the moment the exchange reopens.  They will have pitchforks and torches in hand.
And without regulation, MtGox will just fold its arms and say "Oops."

Thats because they don't like dealing with cheap property.  If you would have had something where they could have made more money, there wouldn't have been a problem.
I've bought a few rental properties over the years without a problem, but thats because the bank is making money.  I also use a credit union.
Refinances though they took a real bath on, so they are very hesitant to do those.
The only issue I had, though it was minor, is every time I tried they wanted 30 year notes, not 15.  Longer term, more interest.  But I want them paid off in 15 years so when I retire I'm making money on the rentals, not making payments still.  They relented, but they sure wanted me to take the longer term.

I actually think that there will wind up being 2 types of "online" currency.  Bitcoin will be the main, it will be the one everyone uses, and it will be because of the government.  It will flourish.
But, another currency....I'll just say Litecoin but I'm thinking more along the lines of something invented that will be a lot more stealthy-will be the one that everything on BTC right now that would be subject to the 3 letter scrutiny will use.  With "legit" businesses on Bitcoin, Bitcoin will be fine, but its not going to go nuts like everyone is predicting.  It will do well, eventually get stable, but not into the hundreds and thousands.
Then this other currency will be the one that the casinos and stuff that got ran out of the US or lost US customers will go to.  (or similar things that will be deemed "illegal by the 3 letters.")  With BTC being "legit" and this other currency only being used by those who desire stealth and only in countries like the US where there is scrutiny, the other currency won't be bothered.
And all will be well, hopefully.  And in places where there isn't scrutiny, it will keep being used as it is now.  So the other "shadow" currency won't be worth as much, but it will be there for people who want to keep low, or have to.  
I dunno.  Its what I envision happening, but more like 5 years down the road.  These fluctuations and similar?  Another year or so, and then if it does go mainstream, the speculation is probably going to drop off after the initial hype.  I think a lot of what we're seeing right now is people testing the waters as it appears on websites like Forbes.  We'll see other spikes....like when someone like Amazon or another major player starts taking it.  But eventually it will slowly come down to some level where it will move up and down like any other currency, with spikes and drops as miners make their sales to cash in, etc.
Eventually it will find parity.
But I think there is another currency yet invented that will fill the void once the scrutiny gets too high.  I envision it being similar but with encryption being involved by default and the transactions not openly viewable online like BTC.

They aren't trying to stop exchanges.  They are trying to make sure that exchanges follow FINCEN rules.  Such as the ones for proper reporting of transactions in excess of 10k, and proper reporting of all transactions an entity or a person makes so they can be properly reported to the IRS in case of tax liabilities, etc.
The Feds don't want to stop Bitcoin anymore than they want a company to stop selling things.  They just want their fair share, if applicable.  An exchange doing things and not reporting it removes this ability, and allows for things like money laundering as well (which is why the 10k rule exists).
The government will embrace Bitcoin with open arms, especially when the speculators who made a mint earlier this year pay their taxes on the gains.  And the ones who don't, well, thats even bigger profits if they get caught, since the fines usually start at double what should have been paid.
Its being cut out of their fair share that triggers such things, and why such regulations exist.  The government doesn't have a problem with Bitcoin, except for the fact it can be used to cover up things that should be taxable or reported because they are over limits.

Being that its eBay, who knows what may happen.
Seller could very well deliver, and then Buyer claims its not as describes, Seller gets docked by Paypal and buyer never sends it back.

I always thought the fee was a suggestion but you could do what you wanted, and it was up to the miners to take your transaction or not.
So they are looking to change the suggested fee, but you can still do what you want, I'm guessing.
Just that if you're too low, they may not get to you for a few blocks, or forever, if they so chose.
8 cents is still a lot lower than the average CC processing fee, which is a percentage of the entire transaction, which I see is mentioned in the thread but is not possible because you don't know what the transaction is, and what the change amount is.

Inflation will do the same to your silly Bitcoin money since the value of it right now is pegged to the dollar.  Its not going to do you or anyone else who has Bitcoin sitting in a wallet if people don't buy into it because stories like these keep coming out about people just having coins vanish for whatever reason.
Your Bitcoin right now is worth $27, but if it doesn't get universally adopted because people are scared off by stories like this, it won't be worth that tomorrow.
I'd rather lose 5% via inflation than 6% if Bitcoin decides to take a $3 loss tomorrow because someone reads an article like this and sells, and it never rebounds.
My certificates of deposit may barely beat inflation, but at least I'm maintaining my money.
If you want to speculate, go right ahead.  But the people who promote Bitcoin want it to be a viable currency.  It will only be that if the people who will allow people to buy in, such as sites like Coinbase, are reliable and as secure as Bitcoin itself.
If not all you will get is people speculating, the value bouncing around, and people losing coins.
Which is fine if you're just in it to make money.  I don't think thats what the creators of Bitcoin want. 
But articles like this do not help promote it as an alternative, trustworthy currency.  It makes it sound like some kind of risky hedge fund.

Perhaps.  So far though, checking into other sites that take Bitcoin, they have a bit of a markup.  I understand that to survive they probably have to do so, but its not really going to work well if they are 10% higher or over $10 more, which is what I see.  
Plus honestly to beat the current major players in the game, discounted shipping for items that require it is going to basically be mandatory-or they won't have a chance.
Its good to see people getting behind people who take it, but I don't see people paying a massive premium over Fiat either.
Loyalty only goes so far.  It may also pull major players into the game, which of course would be positive as well, but that will be at the cost of the little guys who are adopting it now and getting the word out as well.

Many people get credit and then become upside down in it.
Many people complain about banks because they produce credit cards and charge crazy interest.
This isn't going to fly if it follows that business model, especially since quite a few people see Bitcoin as a way to get away from banks.
I find it ironic that people want to get away from banks, yet they want everything in Bitcoin that banks are already doing.
I'm sure if such a thing comes out, the interest rates will be similar.  But I guess its okay because it has to do with Bitcoin to pay fees.
Seriously?  A debit card tied to a address, fine.  But a credit card?  
Maybe you will feel better paying Kim Dotcom interest instead of your bank.  But its still interest.  
But I guess its not going to a bank.  Technically.
Paying Money in any form to use Money is the same, borrowed from a bank or another person.  
Seriously, except for major purchases that have value that secure the loan, stick to cash.
This is beyond hypocritical in my eyes.  Screw Banks!  But I need a credit card!  What?
Enjoy your Visa and Mastercard paying fees to them, still, and then when they expand it out to where you can borrow, still paying a percentage to someone.  Not a bank, but you're still paying for it.  If you think this "venture" will just be for a card that you can use like a debit card....look at who is pushing it.
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:19:30
I would guess that right now anyone being paid in BTC is getting paid the same way they always have, just the end amount after all taxes is then used to buy Bitcoin and the address the BTC is placed into is given to the employee.
I'm sure you could report everything in BTC but that would just create more trouble.  You'd report net pay to the IRS (if the US) in $ and then just convert the net pay to BTC as a favor to the employee.

You'll make a pretty good chunk of change.

Yes you do.  Doesn't matter what the currency is.
Income is income.
They would use the exchange rate at the time to determine what the gain was in USD, and the gain is taxable, depending on exemptions, which depend on the type of gain.
Technically the gain from any sale can be taxable, though there are limits (exemptions) for most things.  Selling a house or a car for a profit and not taking the money and putting it right back into a different house or car are taxable as well, as an example, provided you exceed the threshold.
But in a nutshell, it doesn't matter what currency-profit is profit.  
Talk to a tax professional.  Sine I myself made 250k last year, one is essential to me.  Reporting wrong or failing to report will cost you many times more than just paying the proper taxes on what you made.  It would begin with having to pay the back taxes, penalties on that, and, depending on how bad the misrepresentation was, possibly being charged with filing a false tax return.  
Don't mess with the IRS for sure.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:28:31
Honestly it applies to any investment I think.  But what you have to look at, in the end, is something to support that value.  
The price of precious metals is backed by the fact that people don't just buy them as an investment vehicle.  They are used in manufacturing, and in the case of Gold and others, as jewelery, that people pay a price for.
Its the same with stocks.  Stocks are based on a companys performance.
What props up BTC?
Simply the buying and selling of it.  Nothing backs it except the faith that if you want to sell it tomorrow for X dollars or Y yen or Z Euros, someone will be there to take them off your hands.
I would say its totally different because of that.  Its fine as long as you say "I have 1BTC for $200" and someone says "I'll take it."
But thats about it.  With precious metals, you have the metal still, or the rights to it.  With Stocks, you have the company.  Sure, you can lose money, but if you see the company is going to have a bad quarter or has declined, you can decide to sell your shares well before the massive fall.
BTC is purely the ability to sell what you have for the price you want.  It was all hunky-dory till yesterday, now you have to sell for the price you can get.
Or you can hold and hope that the faith of that system brings it back up.
But except for the willingness of someone to buy at the price you're selling, nothing props Bitcoin up.  Its not backed by anything, and thats what people need to realize.
Well it is backed.  By the community which uses it.  But its up to that community to be willing to buy it at whatever cost it is.  If that doesn't exist, then its overvalued.  This is basically what we're seeing now.  You can speculate it to the moon, but the core community isn't going to step in and pay for it when it would be silly to do so.

Depending on how its setup of course.
I have some stock that I have bought over the years (probably about 100k or so in value).  Through the brokerage I have, I can adjust and have things automatically sell if the bottom just totally drops out of them.  Or I can set triggers that take effect once a stock reaches that threshold.
An example:
Say I buy 1 BTC   I can set so it autosells at 13.80 (average) so I don't lose more than 20 cents.  Note though that obviously at that point I would be offering it at that price, someone has to buy it to complete the transaction.
But I can also setup triggers the other way.  Once it hits 14.20, I can set my floor sale at $14.  At that point I lose nothing.  At 14.40 I could make it 14.20, and so on.  This way I don't have to watch it, once it hits that, or if it has a sudden selloff, I'm out before it gets totally gutted.
I would guess if the person is buying it as an investment, they are watching it like a hawk, and once they think its teetering at the edge of the high, they will sell it before it goes over the abyss, so to speak.
That is what day traders do.  Now what I'm saying is very simplified because there are other ways to buy and sell stock, or just buy it and hold it for a short time and bail on it without even possessing it, etc, but it depends on the persons purposes.
They could be testing the waters.  And a grand is a grand.  They might also think that its going to go further up than 20 cents.  They might hold it for a few days or weeks.  Or slowly sell it off and slowly take profit.  You never know.
(I should say I don't day trade.  But I do have triggers setup on stocks in case they do totally tank on me.  I can take fluctuations, but if a stock I have falls 20% below the price I paid or so, I have it set to bail.  The only stock that has done that to me is RIMM (aka good old Blackberry).  The rest fluctuate but haven't come close to this threshold.  But then again I have stock for the long haul, but I don't want to lose my shirt either if something just totally tanks!)

At the time I sold, they had stalled there for a few days and seemed primed to go down a bit (which they did, but then they went back up to $50).

The government is going to do the same thing they have done for years.  They aren't going to shut down gambling sites.
They are going to get people who win large amounts and then turn it over to USD or whatever, do it stupidly, and have the IRS see it.
They will never be able to totally stop offshore gambling, and that isn't what they will do.  The casual gambler on Peerbet who is putting up a half BTC and wins 4 of them or something they don't care about.
They always go after the big ones who that, upon winning, don't use their brain and sell it off in a massive block, or suddenly have a nice $50k car on a 20k a year salary, yet on their tax return they deduct the vehicle license fee for it.
Those are the people who get caught, and the ones they are after.  The casino?  If they are stupid enough to run on US soil, they deserve what they get also.
@_date: 2013-01-09 02:02:00
Not really.  They don't want to get caught taking payments for sites that are supporting piracy.
I hate PayPal with a passion-and I never will use them ever again and have not for years, but in this case they want to see what exactly people are paying for.
If some Torrent site they accept payments for is sued by a copyright holder and they can prove PayPal was the mechanism used to pay for the account that allowed said access, PayPal becomes a party in the lawsuit.  Saying "we didn't know" will not work.
PayPal does suck, and my prediction is that either way they will soon stop taking payments for such sites.  There is too much liability.  People suing nowadays will target every party they can.  The person uploading the file is probably a average schmoe, Paypal is a multi million dollar company.  Who do you think the judgement will come from?
I seriously want PayPal to rot, but blaming them for trying to absolve themselves of liability by their users or websites using them for fund collection is just plain stupid.

This, and with all the casinos moving to bitcoin, and other "interesting companies" as well (spelled, torrent sites) pretty quick the governments are going to move to make this stuff required and start smacking these companies with fines for not collecting proper information.
Everyone thats cheering the use of bitcoin by more and more entities needs to realize that its coming.  Anyone who thought it would be an anonymous currency.....well, good luck with that.
Government always gets its fingers in the pie.  Trying to avoid it just causes them to come harder after people.
I figure the gambling sites have a year, maybe 2 years tops before the government shuts them down by going after the players again.

Had trading not been suspended, the people on Gox could have sold on the way down to $90.
The way I'm reading this as well, "no orders" means no buying or selling, which I would also assume also means no transfers.
If it does mean transfers, then Gox is making up the difference in price, I don't see how they could afford that.
The last price Gox shows is $124.  So as of right now, thats what people think they have.  Obviously they don't, and unless it gets back up to that at the time of reopening, they won't.
Their hands are totally tied right now.  They can't do shit.
@_date: 2013-05-19 17:56:06
It would kill the price, which in turn, would make that hardware not as useful, which is the point.
Bitcoin itself will never die.  But if the value drops, those people mining it now and making a profit will be selling off their hardware for whatever they can get.
Its profitable as long as someone is willing to pay the going price.  The moment you have 100 BTC and nobody is buying, or buying it for less than your break-even point, its worthless.
@_date: 2013-05-11 17:21:21

It wasn't a get rich quick scheme.
Till people who had BTC at $50 and under saw their money double.  Then triple, then quadruple.
If you had 100BTC at $50 and it was at $250, its very, in fact I'd say its beyond very....tempting to bail.  No matter the reason you had it.  Mined it, bought it to buy something online, whatever.
You can't blame people for temptation.  But then you reach that edge where its going to go over and you have to guess.
And you have to wonder about the ones that piled on above $250.  I don't see how that was sustainable.
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:10:31
Yes, but this thread and article talk about torrenting specifically.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:24:06
Yes true.  But who will control the lions share of them?  Speculators.  Which means one day a few mBTC could be worth $50, and the next minute, $10.
Doesn't exactly make it a stable purchasing vehicle for the average joe.  It may very well become an investment vehicle only if the major players control most of the coin. 
And they may very well milk it for all its got, and then leave the mess for someone else to clean up.  A few big boys will win, many may lose.
Its not always a good thing to have unregulated trade.

I sent money via my Credit Union.  But I don't honestly remember the options because I set it up a while ago.  
I know you can take money in and deposit it to them.  They may be the only bank that does that.  I actually linked my bank account so I could transfer directly.  But it could be that the money goes to BoFA. 
I'm not at home this weekend so I can't see how I did it.  It could be thats how I'm doing it.  All I know is I set it up and thats how I was doing it.  But I haven't moved money in for a few months now, so I honestly forget the actual process.

And with every attack, it bounces around, people panic, and there is more volume.
Either that, or the attacker buys and sells randomly trying to drive the price, and Gox gets a share of each of those as well.
Either way, they are making more money than they are losing in power usage.
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:32:13
Surprised they allow stuff like that to be registered.
It only took a few lines in a config file to keep people from using any "*serv" nickname like Chanserv, Nickserv, etc. on a IRC network with services.
You'd think they could block that kind of stuff pretty easy.
@_date: 2013-03-10 02:27:30
I'd rather be paranoid than paying the IRS more than I already do.
Sure, taxes suck, but tax evasion is a lot worse.  Paranoia is better than losing everything because you thought you could be slick.
Plus, if BTC hits $50 (or I decide to bail prior to that, I'm on the fence but I think another large drop is due) and I sell, we're not talking a few hundred bucks in profit.  Its about 6 grand.
@_date: 2013-03-21 17:38:00

Pools are controlled by whoever runs the pool.
If they wanted to do something fishy with it...they could.
Joining a pool means your hashing power benefits the pool and the pool in turn "rewards you" for doing so.
Of course, the larger the pool, the larger the odds that they will get more blocks as well, which is why people tend to join them.  The bigger the odds, the bigger the potential rewards.
With power comes great responsibility.

Never using an online wallet is impossible.  You can't carry coins on a phone for example without something like that.
I would say a better idea is to only move coins to a online wallet as needed, like an hour before you're going out (so the transfer gets confirmed) and only what you need.
Either that or move to a paper wallet address with a qr-code on it or something.
The only problem of course is predicting what you may spend, and what BTC will be valued at when you do the transaction, so you may have to fudge a little bit to make it work.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:29:59

Possible?  Probably.  But honestly, if they are happy the way they are-I'd leave it be.  Its like if my Dad ever wants to learn the computer.  I taught my Mom, but she wanted to learn.

You can write off the PORTION of it used.
You can't write off the entire amount-only the amounts related to it.  If the utilities or internet are also used by the household, you'd have to do percentages.
This kind of stuff is why I have an accountant.   You can't claim it all-only the portion actually used by the actual rig.   If the rig heats that room though, you could probably buy a window A/C and claim that since you're using it to cool that computer though, as an example.
Have to be really careful how you do it.  Its like running a home office-you can only claim the office space you're using for the office, not the entire house, etc.
It gets complicated, and you have to document EVERYTHING, including how you came to the conclusion your mining rig uses 10% of your house's power consumption etc (10% used as an example).

The others were people who bought into a massive rise thinking that it was going to 1000.
I would refer to them as gamblers, not speculators.  Speculators have a single purpose.  Buy low, pump up, sell high, take profits.  Rinse, lather, repeat.
The others were Gamblers.  Or as the speculators probably refer to them.....suckers, or funders.  They funded their sells nicely.

My subservience?
Its better to pay my taxes properly than not.  If you don't and you get caught, you pay the amount, plus a penalty (usually the same amount again) plus face possible other fines.
I make 250k a year.  Last year my taxes were roughly 33%.  I'd rather report to THE MAN as you put it, properly, and pay 33%, instead of THE MAN finding out I cheated him and then I wind up paying him 66%....or more, since THE MAN knows what I'm making.
Its cheaper to be legit.  Getting caught means you fund the man a lot more.  Especially since THE MAN is the one who determines how bad you cheated and what your penance is.
Its much cheaper to be legit than to try to evade and get caught.  I'd rather be a slave and pay 33% than be his bitch and hand him everything I own, plus go to jail.

It does make sense in the fact that many businesses online and brick and mortar take Paypal, even with all the complaints about it.
But if people do lose coins out of this deal and in others, the entire "no chargebacks" selling point will probably result in people deciding not to take it. 
My original point was that I'm not going to commit a lot of money into it.  Businesses will do the same.  They aren't going to jump through those kind of hoops.  They will stick to what works and has a degree of protection for their money without constant monitoring.
The cry of "We need to get more people to take Bitcoin" is quelled every time a story like this comes to light.
Negative things like this affect Bitcoin a lot more than they do Paypal, or a major bank.
And yes, it is beyond Bitcoin's control, but it may affect its ability to be a serious currency alongside others for this reason.  
Toss in a few other stories about mining and people losing money and people really start becoming wary of it.

I just think its a bit inflated right now.  It seemed to really take a rise right before the halving.   I don't think that rise is going to stick.

PayPal, if it had half a brain (which it does since its checking into sites they are taking payments for to prevent liability) should have just purchased themselves an account.
Then they would see what they want and could simply pull the plug.
PayPal DOES suck, but if a Torrent site gets sued (or a uploader gets sued) and PayPal processed the transaction that got the person the account, guess who else is listed on the lawsuit.
And PayPal will be the only likely person with the ability to possibly pay what they are asking for.
I HATE PayPal, but its obvious why they are doing this.
@_date: 2013-02-17 19:05:51
Most people will do this.
However its also possible that Coinbase is just suddenly short, which means someone went on there, made a purchase order, and suddenly they are 20 short.
Having heard this about some other payment processors as well, I stand by my original comment.
Its very possible I could decide tomorrow to buy $100 in bitcoin from some online source such as this and I don't see a cent because THEY got hacked or similar.
Or, as I said in another comment below this, I could buy it from a private party, but what if they give me the shaft?
Bitcoin is handy in the fact that you can be anonymous and secure your own wallet.  Its also handy in the fact that it makes it extremely easy for con artists and people who are looking to rip you off to do so without any recourse.
Obviously people should take precautions but with all the odd posts about Coinbase lately cancelling orders and similar, I'd say they are having some kind of liquidity problem.
And since they aren't FDIC insured.....
I'll stick to my ripoff bank for my major holdings thank you.

The amount of Fiat it would take them to do so, and the potential losses that would happen if someone did.
People would notice, and people would start bailing if the price went down.  
Although the rich get bored and blow a couple grand here and there, and buy property and stuff on a whim, they do it with the knowledge they are getting value for their money, or in the case of buying property, they will recoup most of the costs.
Doing something like this would be like tossing the money in a fire, and the amount it would take isn't a few hundred grand.  We're talking "real money" so to speak-and by doing it, the chances of losing a good portion if not all of it are too high.
Bankers and similar use "calculated" risk, and the calculation for doing this would just be idiotic-if you lock people out of the market, the price will just fall and that person will lose money.

IRC getting DDOS'd is nothing new.  It could be from someone who got banned long ago as well.
I wouldn't call it just Bitcoin.  IRC was one of the first things to get hit with such attacks.  Many times its just because a network is popular, or because someone holds a grudge against it for whatever reason.
I know when I helped run a network a guy decided to bring his "infection botnet" (it was a backdoor that got installed by people accepting infected DCC SENDS which then would spawn a bot that connected to a channel so the person doing it could control it) onto our network.  We banned the channel and started akilling anything that came into it.  
His response was to move them to another network, then he DDOS'd our servers for about a week till he got bored and found another target.
Its possible, but probably not just all related to Bitcoin.  People have been hitting IRC networks for over 20 years.  The small company I partially own actually started with IRCd hosting and shell accounts too, before we went to server leasing and computer leasing instead.  People would start smaller IRC networks and then go spam larger ones to get users-meaning people would DDOS them because of the spam too.  Being the provider for some of their servers, we would get hit, and our other users would get lag too because of it. 
Part of the reason my boss stopped taking new accounts after a year, and we wound it down pretty quickly after that.
We also hosted MUD servers, which we got rid of because of the people who ran them having shoddy coding, and blaming our servers for it, but thats another story. 
And IRC channels getting flooded is old news.  Most scripts came with stuff like that to make it easier.  And most scripts for ops on a channel had things that would automatically kickban anyone who did since it happened so much :)

Either that or maybe some kind of transition to what people are used to now.  They go to the bank and do everything via the bank.  The bank does the background heavy lifting.  Unless someone is setting up direct deposit or similar, they might know what the numbers on the bottom of the checks are for, but they don't care beyond that.
In a way I was hoping it would kinda stay on the more technical side.  But with the price per BTC now, probably won't be happening.  Unless all the speculators have their fun, get out, and it falls softly to a good solid rate.  Maybe.

Because the person can send you a wallet with a privkey with your coins, and then after doing so, since they have the key, move the coins to another address.
You go to the address, no coins.  You file a claim, Paypal isn't supposed to be used to make such purchases.  You automatically lose due to violating their TOS.
As an added bonus they will probably close your account and if you have any money in it at the time they will seize it and keep it for your illicit activity.  If you have a negative balance they will be sure to hit your credit card or bank account for that amount before doing so as well.
Gotta love Paypal.

Federal tax rate is a sliding scale depending on income.
Combined state/local/federal, after allowed exemptions and deductions took ~33% of my 250k income last year.
The rates do vary, and when you get to the higher points, you are often taxed at one rate, and then another for the portion ABOVE an amount.
For example (making up these figures):
0-100,000 is taxed at 5%
100,000+ is taxed at 5%, plus the amount above 100k is taxed an additional 5%, for a total of 10% on the portion above 100k.  So, depending on how much you make, your effective tax rate may be 6%, or 9%, depending on how far over 100k you are.  There is also a standard deduction (exemption) for income, and depending on the types of income, that can vary also.  It get complicated quick.
If you look at the tax tables on irs.gov, you'll get the idea.  Its not a solid tax-it varies by amount, and the more you make, the more the higher amounts get taxed, once you get over an income threshold.  The tax rates also vary if you're single, married, have kids, etc (those all vary the exemption amounts).
Note also that the 33% was just income tax.  There are other taxes I paid as well-sales tax, property tax, etc.  Those are different, and are paid to the jurisdiction I made the purchase in, and to the jurisdiction my property is in.  Those taxes usually fund roads, fire, police, etc.  
As an example, on my primary residence I pay a $250 assessment to the local fire district.  I also pay them for a permit for my alarm system on my house as well.  They also get funding from the small company I own as well for another fire permit, etc.  They also get a share of the sales tax.   Part of the alarm permit fee is also for the police, but in my case I live in the "county" (US) so that portion goes to the Sheriffs Department, which is also funded partially by my property taxes.  
There are many ways taxes flow/are collected for sure.  Thats why I pay my accountant well.  In fact, I pay a registration fee to the State every year, but I can deduct part of it.  Stuff like that make it even more complex, the more you dig into it.

I know right, and my CD's across a few banks pulled in the usual $570 or so across them like they do every week.
Funny how that works.  Exactly as they are supposed to return every week, based on the monthly rate of return.
Stocks are nice and stable as well.
And my paycheck was right what it was supposed to be.
Damn Fiat.  So unreliable.  Fuck banks, seriously.  Doing what they are supposed to do.  Dammit.

I agree with you but nobody will listen here.
The fact is the only thing propping it up is people continuing to buy, and sellers having someone to sell to.
The moment they try to sell and nobody is there, and nobody will buy except at a way lower price, is when it will fall.
There is nothing holding it up but sheer speculation and the willingness of people to pay the going price.  The higher it goes, the less likely its going to happen.
One massive sale...or another oddity like a fork, and you're going to see a dent.  If people panic, it may become more than that.
But where its at now, there isn't anything you can cite to justify where it is.  I bought in at 50, beyond that I don't see anything holding it up but people buying and selling and driving it.  Sure there is increased use, people on the ground floor are doing a little spending and probably a little selling, but they know if they sell too much it will drop fast.
If someone bails, and bails hard, for whatever reason, thats when things will get interesting.
With every dollar, I get itchy to sell.  I'm not the only one.  I have 200 in the game.  There are plenty with a lot more than that.
Eventually people are going to scratch, and when that happens, speculators will bail, not fill the void.  They will wait till it stops falling, then get back in.  Who knows how far that will be.
If anyone can seriously produce something that shows that it should be where it is besides speculation, I'd like to see it.  Because except for press and people clamoring and buying because they think its going to keep climbing like it is, there is nothing sustaining the price.  Its not a commodity like Oil or Gasoline.
The moment some holders start selling, and selling hard because they are nervous and think it will fall, thats the moment we get the test.  Will a bunch of people move in to buy whats being dumped?  Or will they sit there, watch it fall, and bail themselves while they can still make a profit?
Only time will tell.  At $50 I believed in people buying and holding.  At $100, not so much.  People are buying with the intent to sell.  And the moment they think its reached its peak....

Well sure the Dollar gets plenty of illicit usage as well, and will continue to.
But Bitcoin created this nice global currency where you can "take stuff off the grid" so to speak, and leap borders without having to send a guy with a suitcase full of hundreds through a border checkpoint, or somehow move a bunch of money via wire without it triggering some kind of limit.
What you saw though is the timeframe it takes for governments to determine something illegal is going on, and allow it to go on for a long enough timeframe to get the people doing it not only caught, but with enough evidence to convict.
So it had its heyday for a few months or maybe years depending on how you look at it.  But the ride eventually has to end.
Will Bitcoin end?  No. The level of shady use will drop just like in other currencies.  Its not going anywhere.  But I don't think we'll see the massive rises in USD per BTC anymore like we did.
It probably only took one person getting rich quick off percentages and not paying the taxes properly to trigger all of this, as well.  Always starts with one, moves on after that.

Probably a lot of it just isn't intrusions, but the ability to properly track transactions for tax purposes.
The USA isn't the only country that requires transactions over a threshold to be reported, as well as if the total of them combined hits a level.
You probably have a lot of people using these exchanges who aren't providing proper contact information.  The moment the government sees this, they will move in to stop it, because people are making money and the government isn't getting their fair share.
And when that happens, ultimately, the exchange gets the blame, they probably get audited somehow, and the taxes not properly reported are seized out of the funds the exchange holds.
Everyone thats sending money to an exchange, or going somewhere and doing it with cash will probably ultimately cause that exchange to fail, because the exchange cannot properly report the source of the funds, or who funds are going to later.  
Which is why I'm surprised its even allowed.  A good exchange will demand this information before you even trade a dime.  Otherwise, the liability falls onto them to identify who is doing what with the funds.  If they can't do this, they cannot comply with most banking regulations out there, and they are in trouble already.  I had to do this with E-Trade when I opened an account.  I couldn't even send them a DIME till I verified who I was and my tax information for proper reporting to the IRS provided I exceed thresholds in the tax code.
Probably what is happening here.
The problem is that if this is the case, any alternative will have to start from the ground up being totally legit, requiring ID verification before trading, etc.
And there is a large segment of the Bitcoin community who doesn't want that.  But it will have to happen.
Gox may only have a matter of time itself if its letting people trade without ID and they are getting to amounts that the tax man wants a cut of as well, and said people cannot be properly ID'd by SSN or whatever other means other taxing authorities require.

Although I'm all for people gambling and the like, if they so choose to, I have a feeling that a lot of that being shifted to Bitcoin because its illegal with other methods is going to undermine the main attraction to it for a lot of people-that its anonymous and out of the eyes of government scrutiny.
I think that use is going to bring it into the scrutiny of them a lot quicker, although that kind of publicity may be good for it, who knows.   
But people using it, winning and not reporting it to the IRS is probably going to raise some eyebrows if it really takes off and we're talking jackpots exceeding the $600 threshold.
I'm not going to sell and get out of it because of it, but I think it will bring some unexpected attention to it that may, temporarily, make some people rethink it.
It did probably help bring awareness of it up a bit.  So in the long run, it may not be an effect at all.  But after seeing the governments stance on offshore gambling, then getting credit card companies to not allow people to fund such things anymore, I don't think they are going to sit back and allow it to happen, either.
It will be interesting to see what effect it has.
Edit:  I mean Offshore Gambling, and websites that allow it without reporting to the IRS.

At a cost to the seller and buyer.
All I pay to a BTC accepting merchant is the miner's fee.
Paypal hits the seller with a transaction fee and takes a percentage off the top instantly.
Besides the fact their escrow sucks.  I had a seller sell something to me, then 2 weeks later I bought something from them again, never got anything, seller uses the prior transaction I did with them as proof they shipped it, dates are totally off, PP sides with seller.  Goodbye, $500+.
Fuck Paypal.  Seriously.  Their Escrow service sucks in my opinion and I will never use them again.

It goes higher if you have multiple owners on the account or other special accounts, or a combination of them.
It can actually go up to 1,500,000 if you have the right combination of account types, and you max each out to the insurance limit.
I have a few accounts in a Credit Union which uses its own insurance.  It varies in coverage, but is disclosed depending on the type of account upon opening.
Diversification across a few banks is key if you have a good amount of funds in them, just as it is in investments.

I think perhaps more education is in order about risk.
Because simply put these people seem a lot more in a panic about it than they would be if they understood it.
But if services continue to lose "money" for whatever reason-they being short, hacked, or similar, it makes Bitcoin look bad overall.
Because these kind of stories will be the ones pushed to the front page, not the positive ones.
The marketing of Bitcoin as a way to say "screw you to your bank" doesn't look very good with this kind of thing going on.

Seeing that I got the 10k I initially put in (and 6k of that was profit from previous sells) I don't mind.
But since I do keep an eye on it, I'd likely still make some money.  Unless the crash to zero happens in my sleep.
I'm betting a lot of early adopters (my last buy was at 50) have already silently taken what they initially put in back out-and are sitting on the rest.
With the gains we've seen its easily done.  Now they are just riding on the rest to see how high it goes.  So once the big hit does come, they will still have broken even.
Its the ones buying in now that you have to wonder about.  The higher it goes, the higher the "abyss" has to be. Or is it?
At least I'm playing with house money now, so to speak.  Someone buying in now will need to see $400 to double their money.
Course, if you're just looking for a nice 20% return, that may not take long.  I wonder what the speculators goals are.  20% will beat anything on the street for sure, except for some longshot bet on some startup.

The problem with your theory is that MtGox is not the only trading platform.
So like it or not, the price is going to fall or rise either way.  MtGox is only one of many places people can trade Bitcoin.
If they freeze trading, then you just lose more because now nothing is moving at all, instead of at a slower rate due to DDOS or volume.
By the time they lift the freeze, the price could be $50 higher, or $100 lower.  MtGox doesn't control the Bitcoin trading market.  They aren't an exclusive trading platform.
Them freezing trading does nothing.  It doesn't suspend Bitcoin in time.  Just because a lot of places get quotes from MtGox doesn't mean they control trade of it.  There are plenty of other places that trade it, and will continue to do so while MtGox freezes itself.
The price isn't going to just sit and wait.  Once the freeze is lifted, if other places want $25 less, then your trades will simply sit, because nobody is going to pay them.  Or, better yet, people get screwed simply because the value is less or more than it was when the freeze started.  It works to your advantage if the price rose during the freeze, but if it dropped, you may be selling for a lot more than what you paid when you bought.
MtGox is not the only place you can trade Bitcoin.  Suspend operations, and the other trading houses will appreciate the increased business.  They aren't going to stop trading.  It will go on, MtGox or no.  MtGox doesn't hold exclusive trading rights to the market.  
Those are all the places that trade Bitcoin in USD.  Gox is the first listing.  The rest of them are probably trading as usual, unless they are under attack.  But even if they are, they are still trading.  They aren't going to sit and wait for Gox.  And its likely the attack is people submitting trades, not DDOS.  Maybe it was at first, but a bunch of people logging in trying to sell, or trying to buy once it goes down a lot, will have the same effect.
The bottom line is Gox is built for Bitcoin when it was $25/BTC.  It can't handle todays reality.  Thankfully there are other exchanges.  Those are probably being pounded like crazy right now, also.  Its not DDOS, its the lack of capacity.

That pool would likely be left in the dust by the sheer number of pools using ASIC.
Even if you got all the GPU people together, its likely their hashing power would match the power of maybe one ASIC pool.  And there will be more than one of those for sure, not to mention the number of people doing it on their own.
The odds would be way lower for that pool to score a block, and when they do, the sheer number of members in the pool would make the "share" they get very low.  Probably not worth enough for them to bother.

I had 210 BTC at roughly $14 that I sold at $42.
Then it got back down to $32ish and I went back in for 250 BTC at that price.
I sold yesterday at $48.
Why did I do it?  Because there isn't a stock, money market fund, or anything that makes that kind of profit.  Period, the end.
I wasn't in it for speculation.  I had bought the BTC originally to buy a computer system for myself, but then I got a better dial via fiat.  So I just held onto the coins.  
I'm sorry, but if you had that kind of BTC and the value increased that much, the temptation to pull the trigger is there.
The gains were too great to NOT take.
Did I enter BTC as an Investor?  No.  Are people doing so?  Sure they are.  And they will as long as they can make those kind of gains.  Once they cannot, they will walk away and the price will settle, but as long as it keeps swinging and people can keep pulling money out of it, they will.
Having said that, I don't believe in all of this "really taking off" stuff.  The only way thats happening is if the speculation continues, honestly.  If people just buy and hold, its not going to skyrocket.  The very thing you're talking about is what is driving the price.  If the investing and speculation goes away, so do the value jumps.
Do what you want, but don't hope for it to go away, if you want it to "really take off" you need investors driving the price.
I should mention, by the way, my sale at $48 yesterday was my "endgame."  I'm not a short term investor.  I took advantage of the drop that happened after my first sale.  I won't be going back in that hard.  If it does drop back down to the $32ish range I may buy 50 so I have some around for purchases online.  But I will admit, I purely took advantage of what has happened in price.  But I'm a long term investor and I believe in low risk, at this point....the risk now is too high for me to take such a "large" position again (I put it in quotes because my other investments are much larger, but I'm talking about Bitcoin and what I have done).  I've taken my gamble, and I'm walking out of the casino now.  Good luck to everyone who continues to play at the table, so to speak.  I'm sweating too much to continue in that part of the game now.

I think they did, but didn't think about the fact that you're still going to have to have some kind of control to it, even if only for software, bug fixes, and blocksize changes as needed.
But I think part of the reason it wasn't thought of was because they didn't think it was going to take off like it did, suddenly.
But having a currency without a central authority is unrealistic.  Its not like you have to have the bank of Bitcoin, but someone has to oversee it.
It could spell trouble in the future if the developers suddenly stop seeing eye to eye on things.

Actually most computers now come with 2TB and 3 TB drives are available.
18GB isn't much.  There are games that easily take 100GB nowadays or more.  If you have ones like The Sims with multiple addon packs like I have seen, 200GB+ is nothing.
Now if the blockchain starts reaching OS size like Windows 7.....I'm sure people will start complaining, but seriously if you have a spare SATA port and $125 or so, a 2TB drive for Bitcoin only won't be a problem for someone, especially a hardcore user or a miner.
By the way, if you defrag, make sure you exclude that directory from doing so, or you will have to re-index the blockchain every time you do it.  Found that out the hard way the first defrag I did after I got it ages ago.

I would say however that perhaps MtGox needs to get on the ball and get some more people hired in the verification department.  
That is a lot of potential commissions they are missing out on, which really makes me wonder.  I'm not saying they should go nuts with it, but a 25% increase in staff in that department would probably do wonders for their bottom line, and easily cover the costs of doing so.

I wonder though how many of the people on the order list are resellers who planned on selling once they are available at a premium, and are waiting just like everyone else to get their order and then resell it.

They probably won't reveal themselves till they have the actual hardware though, which is smart, obviously.

Last I've heard lately they are down to about 50% of the market share.
But it doesn't matter.  The trading will still go on.  All it will really do for you is freeze what you have.  And Gox isn't going to let you pull it out during a freeze.  They will cash you out at the going rate once they unfreeze.  If thats higher, great.  If its lower......you get the idea.  The market isn't going to stop while Gox freezes.
But once they unfreeze, then its going to line back up with what everyone else is doing.
The key isn't the fact that people are going to run to other currencies, the key is that people doing heavy trading are doing it in more than one house.  
You can buy and sell BTC in many places.  Then after you're done, move it to Gox to cash out when its not lagging.  Many different ways to do it.
But if you also notice, Gox is the only one seeing 120.  The other exchanges fell, but they are staying right around 180.  Probably because they aren't lagging.
If I had any money in Gox, I'd be moving it as soon as the lag is over and the price levels out, and gets back to where its going to sit for a bit.  This was a nice demonstration of how the lag can hurt people.  You're seeing the wild swings on Gox because its lagging, so people are panicking and selling before it drops even further, and then you have people putting in buy orders at 130 or so because of the panic.  People are bailing before it drops that much further and they hope their order gets through before the lag causes it to be worth even less...and less, and less.....
But hey, perhaps Gox can serve another function-just as a Bitcoin to USD exchange.  Just wait for it to stop lagging and sync back up with the prices elsewhere then you can cash out.
But trading wise, looks like elsewhere is more stable.
I personally think a freeze would make things worse if a slide starts.  They freeze trading, people put in orders based on where the market was going before the freeze.  You unfreeze, it keeps falling.  You refreeze.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  Either that or they cancel trades enmasse when they freeze, which is great if Bitcoin comes out +$25 after the unfreeze.  But if its down and you were trying to sell before it dropped $50....they unfreeze, thats the going price, you're stuck with it.
Honestly I think if Gox instituted such a poilcy, it would work well.  People would yank their trades out of it like crazy, trade elsewhere, then just move it back to cash out.  If people aren't using it as a trading platform anymore, the lag would cease.
Maybe that would work better than them actually fixing their computer systems and bringing them into 2013.  If they want to be the "80% of all Bitcoin Trade" perhaps they should install the capacity to do so.
Because right now except for the speculators who are using it to their advantage, nobody else is laughing.  Today is yet another demonstration of the fact that Bitcoin is growing up but Gox seems to think its still in Diapers.  The bottom line is, people know its gonna lag-they count on it.  Sell at the beginning, get enough people to say "oh shit!" and start selling, wait for it to fall, place buy orders about $100 less.  The lag helps all the panicked sell, and then their buys go through.  Profit: $100/btc or better.  Lag ceases.  Let it climb to $300.  Next week, do the same, set your buys at $150....you're doubling your money.....
Gotta love unregulated trade!

Eroded?  I dunno.  My mortgage payments are the same every month, my income is the same every month (unless I get more/less overtime, but my salary/hourly is the same), I have a good solid 45% going into investments/retirement every month, the numbers look the same, in fact they have increased slightly this year also.
I just went and bought a new pickup a few weeks ago, the price was pretty much what I expected it to be, and its been right around that for a few years now also.
I dunno.  I don't see any erosion.  Then again I make 250k a year so maybe I'm not noticing it.  Prices are up a bit at the grocery store, but then again so is the price at the pump, so I expect that the price to manufacture, transport, and stuff like that has risen a bit.
But depending on the day, BTC could be 280, 200, 51 (I should know, bought 100BTC  last week), and now its at 125.
If there is any expansion and erosion, I'd say its on the BTC side at the moment.   But hey, what do I know.  Probably why I only have ~116 of them.
But my Fiat investments were worth ~900k last week.  And hey, look, they still are today.  Must be that eroding purchasing power you're talking about.
Till the price of BTC stabilizes, I'd stick with the "BANKS SUCK!" and "GOVERNMENT REGULATION SUCKS!" arguments.  Eroded purchasing power doesn't work when the value of a BTC has varied $75 in a week.

Yes, but considering Mining software is usually ran on untended machines, its likely something would be pushed through before the humans could pull the plug in a panic like in the Terminator scenario.
And once its pushed through, without majority it cannot be rolled back and re-pushed through.
The machines solve totally on their own, so by the time the damage is noted, it will already be more than a few blocks behind, most likely.  You can pull the plug at that point I suppose, but the damage will likely already be done.  The only thing is being able to sell the fork off before all the exchanges find out, since its likely that would be the reason it would be done.

Sounds good.
Your Gox limit depends on when they process your ID though so it varies.  
I used Bitfloor for trading, myself, mostly.  BitStamp and BTCe I used sometimes.
Once you get verified they will tell you limits and that will tell you what you can do.  Might take a bit.  I got verified probably close to 7 months ago now?  Something like that.  I'd have to find the email.
Bank transfer works best though.  Just be careful that you don't move stuff around too much.  Each time you do you have a potential fee depending on who you are moving from.  They usually don't charge for moving to.  Also, you get fees when buying or selling.  Just make sure you factor that in-you'll get a smidge less BTC/Fiat with each buy and sell.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:27:15
They aren't because they know when they reopen its very likely BTC is going to be $30 lower, and by halting trading, those people didn't have a chance to sell before it got there.
But it will be handy for those wishing to move their holdings off Gox and never come back.
I have a feeling there will be a lot of that going on.

This is the reason they are doing it.  If they knowingly continue to do business with a potentially illegal enterprise, they are guilty of a crime as well if they continue to do it.

Whoever does this first and follows the law *properly* will wind up with all the exchange business eventually.
The thing is though, some people won't go for it simply because of it being regulated, using it will require identifying yourself.
Gox may hang on for that reason, if they don't get stuff frozen themselves eventually.
They will surely have to get attorneys and similar involved though, which means at first, expect a pretty high fee.  Unless they can get investors involved on a large scale.

Keep what you need on there to do so.
But pull anything that you aren't actively trading, or profits from same, into another wallet.
Only leave on there what you're going to buy with, don't leave the whole enchilada sitting there.
ex: I have 200 BTC.  I bought them at $10.  It increases to $20.  I sell them for $4000.  I take $2000 profit and move that out of the exchange, keeping the $2000 I started with there for when it falls to $10 again or whatever.  Lather, rinse, repeat.  But don't leave everything there.  And if the price isn't going to fall for a bit to where you want, pull it all out and drop it back in later.  Better to lose the few percentage points in exchange than to lose it all.
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:15:49
Yes but usually an IPO has to show something for it.  You don't just get all that money and say "okay, thank you, goodnight" and take it all.
There are regulations against that sort of thing, and most IPO's like Facebook set restrictions on the amount the people who would get the most stock out of the deal can sell.
And the stock will tank if there is no realistic reason for the IPO to be at the price its set at.  Facebook IPO'd because they could show they have sustainable income.  Without that, nobody will buy.
BTC has no such limitations.  If someone wants to sell a bunch, the only thing stopping them is lack of buyers.  If the bottom falls out tomorrow, what you have is worthless.  Its only worth something if someone is willing to pay you what they are "worth."
Stocks are backed by figures presented 4 times a year demonstrating profits.  You don't IPO and take the money and run.
But you can with BTC.  You just need someone willing to buy what you have at the price you want.  Big difference.

The difference between you and me is that I fully disclose my money and what I do with it to the IRS, and I pay my taxes.
Why?  Because getting caught means paying double, for starters, and in some cases, if malice is proven, they can simply take it all.
You're not being a rebel by deception in an attempt to foil the government and the IRS.  You're stupid, in the long run.
Sure, you might get away with it now.  Hell, you might never get caught.  But when you have money in the bank, assets, and other stuff like that, you pay your taxes.
Its better than getting caught and having all of that seized because, well, you broke the law, and thats your fine.  Enjoy your cell.
You're damn right they know about every penny.  I prefer paying ~33% of my income in taxes, than 100%+ liens on my property for years, or them just taking it all and giving me a room in the federal pen.

You should diversify anyway.  Especially if you made enough that you only had to cash out 13%.

I just got nervous, honestly.  I was already nervous, and the up and downs getting into the $50 range got me itchy.
I'm getting anywhere from 3-6% on the CD's.  Depends on the term.  Some of them are long, 5 years, and I have a few in 1 year or 2 years.  Trying to make it so one matures every few months in case I have a need for it suddenly.
But those rates are fairly high because of the amounts.  The longer term ones have 50-100k in them each.  Also varies by bank.  My Credit Union pays a little less, but is who I bank with.  But I have them spread out as well.  Thats where an accountant/advisor comes into play.  Costs a little bit, but checks around for me when I need a CD, gets me the best rate, keeps all the tax shit straight.  Quarterlies can be a pain in the ass.

Hopefully they do like the average gas station owner does, and price things well enough that they can absorb the rises and falls of the currency.
Part of the reason why when oil goes up, gas prices shoot up fast, and then gradually come back down.
Have to average out the amount of money per gallon in the underground tanks based on what they paid for it when it came in.
Would be bad quickly for them if they make a major order at 150 then sell it all for 145 because of fluctuations.
Going to have to track it very well, build that into the prices.  And hope they are competitively priced in doing this.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:54:47
You should start considering slowly taking profits at this point, to hedge against a major fall.
Not a major amount, but you've doubled your money.  Might want to consider taking out 5% for every 10% in value you increase.  At least until your initial investment money is out.
At that point you're on house money and any gains are purely profit.
But its your call, of course.  Just keep an eye on it.  Just be sure you get what you put in out of it before it falls, if it does.

Its going to keep going up.
But if you notice, the last few raises were sudden, then it fell back a few bucks, and then slowly crawled up again.  Once it got close to the sudden high price, suddenly it shoots up $3 or so.
It appears to me that someone with some holdings at a lower price is somehow causing it to go up, or some other factor is causing it, then it falls because people with holdings are selling in droves, causing the fall.
Having seen it happen a few times now I'm honestly starting to wonder whats going on.  It looks like its being manipulated to me.  I don't know how, but it is.
One thing I have noticed too is a lot of bitcoin related retailers haven't adjusted prices as much as the rises.  Right now if you bought from some of them you would be spending more money in USD.  I mean I understand that the price is in flux, but I would honestly set prices on such sites in USD, and then if you want to order with BTC, make some kind of agreement on exchange rate for an item.
I'm not going to name names, but there are some sites out there with computer stuff on them that if I paid what they wanted in BTC, I'd be paying about 20% markup at their price as listed, at 1BTC=$21.

It is sarcasm.  Because the same people who scream they want to see big banks fail and governments squeal are the same ones who are sitting behind a computer being provided power from a large power company, and a major ISP.
And then they get in their car and drive to the store via the government paved road, and the reason why people obey the rules of the road (well, most of them) are because of the government provided police force that keeps people from getting too out of hand.
And the list goes on and on.
They don't want to pay for government, but they sure use the stuff it helps provide.
A more correct statement would be less intrusive government, and a government that collects taxes, but only to keep the infrastructure secure.  Not wasting it on BS.
A lot of people scream for Anarchy but don't understand what a totally disorganized life would be like.

Limits are a factor but once you verify at Gox the limits get higher (they also go up once you have been verified a while.)  I mostly used them for cashout purposes only.  I used other sites for actual trades for the most part.
But then again I also didn't really trade when the lag happened, I was already out at the last big dip, etc.
If you verify and get setup for wire transfers you're good though-plus, once you have sold, you have the money in USD, (at least in my case) so you can just move it out in chunks.  Depending on how much it is, it can take a few days.  But its not like once you sell you have to keep it in BTC until you can move it.  You can leave a Fiat balance in Gox and other exchanges.  I kept it spread out.
That has the best explanations of it all.

The 6% one I have 100k in.  I have a bit...more than that in them all told, spread across a few banks.  Plus, my businesses use the same bank that one is in, so that helps a bit.
Most of my shorter term ones fall right at 4% though.  You have to commit a good chunk and for a good term to do better.  I think I may have some around 3.75% as well.  It varies. but usually the larger you commit the better they do for ya.
I know they don't beat inflation, but my goal is to preserve.  I do have a bit in the market like I said.  Most is via a conservative set 401k, though I do have a bit in actual "raw" stock as well.  
Best return I've seen out of that is 15% in one year.  That stock I sold.  Then it plunged.  I still own their phone though.  Blackberry...  I just lucked out and bought right in a trough, turns out.  I think they released a phone right after I did and some good earnings.  Since then they have stagnated, I haven't checked it lately though.  The rest are modest, but I have them for long term.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:45:23
It might be.
But I think a major issue for it is the fact that you can't chargeback.  I'm not saying its not a good thing, but with the amount of errors you see people doing around here, a short window that allows you to bail on something if you screw up would be a good thing.
Many people say that if you don't know what you're doing, don't do it-but that kind of attitude won't work with something mainstream.
And if someone comes along with something that makes it more foolproof, it will take off.
If it can be integrated into what exists currently I don't know, but if it can't, I expect another iteration.  Why not, look at all of the different types already.

But how many small businesses have the time to bother doing that with their payment processor every few hours to ensure that if that processor is suddenly hacked or whatever, they don't lose any money?
This kind of stuff happening sets a bad precedent for Bitcoin and could really cause it to be stopped in its tracks.  
Yes, you have to take appropriate precautions.  
But as a business owner, any payments I take that go into my bank are insured, even if the place gets hacked.  
It doesn't instill confidence in the currency when you do a search for Bitcoin and issues and start finding stuff like this, which is my point.
Incidences like this where the processor is having issues, may be short on money, or whatever the reasoning doesn't make it attractive to businesses looking to accept Bitcoin.
And that is my point, if you have to take extra steps to prevent your coins from perhaps falling victim, you are not going to see people putting a lot of money into it.
If I was using this service or another similar to it and I had to get on there hourly to pull my coins lest I might lose them (and I might mention, have no recourse) I think I would just stick to what I'm doing now.
And that is my point.  Its not going to take off if you have to constantly do this kind of thing to ensure your coins are secure.
Bitcoin is not friendly towards the stupid, rash, or those who have to rely on payment processors to actually be secure and trustworthy, which is exactly what this incidence and others like it continue to point out to business owners.
This is why you are not seeing it being adopted very widely, and if these payment processors continue to have issues and play games for whatever reason it is, it will never be adopted widely.

I still have a good amount of holdings today.
But I will admit that the block of 100+ BTC that I had bought at 9 I sold at $25.
I still have about 60 @ 11 and 200+ish at a $14 average, roughly, which I'm keeping.
I might...MIGHT dump the 60 @ $11 if it gets to $29.  But thats only a strong might at this point.
The rest I will likely hold, especially now with the announcement that reddit gold can be bought with it, and the potential for a few other sites I use to use it as well, plus I do occasionally do some small purchases with it on BitMit.
I don't think there is any real steady analysis except that it seems like it hits some kind of high and then someone suddenly sells, driving it down a good 25% or so, then its right back up within a day or two.  If its someone with major holdings cashing in or what, I dunno.
If that holds true, the next hiccup should be around $32.
But my guess is as good as anyones, honestly.

I'll stick to stable stuff, I think.  
The funny thing is I never intended BTC to be a investment.  My first buy almost 6 months ago now was because I was going to buy a computer off a BTC website.  Then I found too good of a better deal online for USD and I just kept them.

The fear of the crash won't make me sell, I'm just not going to buy into more because of it, however.  You're right, we're all just guessing.
The risk of it isn't enough to make me bail, but the risk of it is stopping me from buying more.

The sudden fall changed my mind, trust me.  I know a lot of people were on here predicting gloom and doom, but if you seriously told me it was going to go from $280 to $80....I probably would have raised an eyebrow.
Also I'd only buy if it stopped there.  It hasn't obviously.  With BTC, I'd say it would have to be at a stable price for at least 2 days before you might, and I say heavily...MIGHT be at the bottom.
I'm sure a lot of peoples predictions have changed.  The last 24 hours especially has been....interesting to say the least.

Hypotetical situation:
My small company leases a server to someone.  That person puts something highly illegal on it.  The cops nab him, but instead of busting him, the cop takes a payoff to keep it quiet.  I get my server back, it gets swept under the rug.  I don't even know it happened, all I know is my server gets returned.  I assume the guy went out of business or something.
6 months later that police department gets investigated.  A WikilLeaks person hacks in and grabs the info, including the data collected on the guy.  My company is mentioned in the report.  A competitor of mine gets the info and runs a smear campaign that my company leases to crooks.  I lose 10 clients.
Now, although highly unlikely, this is one of many things that could happen, in the name of "freedom" to someone if WikiLeaks decides to cash in on some glory and expose things that probably shouldn't.
Should corruption be exposed?  Yes.  But in the manner WikiLeaks does it, its irresponsible.  In this case, with all the evidence being leaked, the attorney for that cop could easily scream tainting and said cop would probably WALK as well, even though hes extorted a few hundred people for a bunch of money.
You have to be careful what you do with information.  Full disclosure isn't always a good thing.  But WikiLeaks doesn't think that way.  They just toss it out to the world for the karma.  Look at some of the stuff they released already.  To call them irresponsible would be a understatement.

I get clients sometimes forwarding them to me asking if they need to renew 3 months after they renewed.  At least now it appears the emails are clearer and don't show domains as needing renewal till 3 months prior instead of the other way around.  
But every month you get a "status" of all your "products" on there.  And before they fixed the email format, it appeared that, if you looked at it literally, that all your products were expiring.

The problem of course at this point is the technical level required for it.  Although you could just hand someone a paper wallet, they aren't going to hand you the goods till they can make sure you can't take the money :)
Most ordinary people aren't going to do it though-if you are doing stuff like that, then you're looking for trouble.  I buy my guns legally because if for whatever reason in the future someone breaks into my house and I have to brandish it or use it, it should be on record that I own the weapon in question.
People doing that kind of stuff are doing things under the table to get weapons prohibited by law or because they are prohibited by law to possess them-both things that an average, responsible gun owner wouldn't be doing. 
People skirting the law makes it worse for those who do follow the rules and who do wish to possess guns legally.  I would have no reason to hide my transactions.  They will be on public record anyway, since the guns I own are registered to me.  
Are there banned weapons I'd like to possess?   Sure.  But I'm not going to risk losing the ones I have now, besides jail time, to possess them.  I prefer to have them legally and possess them legally.  Anyone who goes under the table just makes it worse for those who hate the laws, but want to stay legit.
It may very well result in restrictions getting so difficult that you won't be able to possess at all someday.

With all the DDOS we're seeing, I'm wondering if there are extortion attempts behind it, like what happened to a few sites a few years ago.
Usually it would start and they would contact the host, saying to send some kind of amount of money to an address and it will stop.
I wouldn't blame any of them for not reporting it, but except for hitting things like this or exchanges, I don't see the point, unless there is some kind of protection racket running around trying to score a few coins.
Mining pools and exchanges I get, but for crissakes someone was hitting bitcoinstore this morning.  I don't see any reason other than extortion for doing that.

Especially when there is no solid reason for any of it.  People spout plenty of things, but the only thing thats supporting the price, and any price, is the willingness of people to pay it and confidence.
Another fork, or a bad article that people for some reason believe, and it could change rapidly.
It will keep going up as long as people are willing to buy in at the going rate.  If that stops, it could get interesting.
And if some major players get in on it and shoot it up, it may very well get out of the reach of the average investor.  Although you can buy fractions, but still.

Depends on your intentions.
I never day-traded.  I bought, held for a bit, sold (because I thought they peaked) held cash for a few days and either cashed out and bought back in later, or rebought with cash already sitting on the exchanges.
Once I acquired BTC and it was properly confirmed I would move it off the exchange to my personal wallets.  I'd then hold them there till I wanted to make a move or a purchase, then I'd move to the appropriate exchange.
If you're day trading its different then buying and holding.
I'd go with reputable before going with the best price.  The only reason I used BTCe before was because it was an option on Blockchain (I don't know if it still is).  
You're probably kind of stuck as to where to buy simply because of where you can deposit your funds.  I'd suggest depositing and then buying into BTC with whatever that exchange gives you, since moving fiat usually costs $$.
Plus, the prices now mean nothing.  Till your funds are available, you can't buy anyway.  You have to put your money in, then once its available, look for a good price and buy in.  By the time your money hits, the prices you're seeing now could be less or more.
In the beginning I used the others but I gravitated to Bitfloor/Gox.  I didn't know what I was doing (well, I kinda knew, but not really)  Once I learned a bit I gravitated away from the others.
Right now might not be the best time to buy either with what happened a few days ago, also.  Thats why you're seeing such broad ranges in price.  It could be that an exchange is being ddos'd as well-so trades can't go through.  Another recent development in the Bitcoin fun as well.
It was way different when I first bought in.

Cyprus is a great example of Government mismanagement.
And if they bought into Bitcoin, that means they did pre-crash, which means they potentially lost up to half of the value again, if they bought in at over $200.
I believe austerity took 10% of value.
Investment of Bitcoin could have resulted in up to a 50% loss in that case depending on when they made their move.
I'd call that a pretty significant erosion of purchasing power, wouldn't you?
Great for people like me whose holdings is right around $52, but not for those who are sitting on BTC bought around $200 or so, or who sold out once it crashed.....
When Bitcoin has a bit of a more...stable value, start talking up purchasing power.  When the graphs in the past month show it losing over 50% of value, purchasing power is not a good argument.

I don't know.  The way it was made out to be though was that they didn't know or have the ability to decrypt anything on their servers.  Suddenly they could.
Like I said, I didn't keep anything on it that really required it, I wouldn't have cared, but to be told that they didn't have access and then suddenly "oh wait, we will in some cases" changed my mind about paying for it.  I still use the free version, but if I have anything larger than 4GB to move I just use a USB stick instead, and the stuff that I did have on there that may have been considered sensitive (that I had encrypted myself) I just moved to a USB stick instead.

You see how people overreact on the internet.  This subreddit is a good example sometimes, though usually on the positive side of things.  If it goes the other way, it could get interesting.

If the exchange gave you a send to address, you can.  Otherwise you may have to move it in another fashion.
I wouldn't suggest doing this.  I'd route your coins to multiple addresses, and then forward them from there to the exchange as needed.  Leaving all your eggs in one basket is not a good idea.  
And with the way exchanges are suddenly closing, I wouldn't directly route to one for this reason either.  Only move coins to an exchange as needed for cashout or other reasons.

Probably because when you buy a prepaid card you get a receipt showing it was funded, and if it suddenly isn't, you have some recourse with it.

I used my credit union all the time to fund BTC buys.
But then again I've been with a Credit Union since the day I turned 18 and could make that decision myself.
I only use conventional banks to spread out some of my investments (don't have all my eggs in one basket) but even then I went across multiple local credit unions first.  I only had to use a regular bank because I wanted my money spread out more, and the bank had a rate on a CD that I had to take advantage of.
The only requirement my CU gives is a $10 balance.  No fees for a checking account.  Don't have to have direct deposit either.
And now that you can use your debit card at any CU across the country that belongs to their network without a fee, the whole "locations" BS that regular banks give you as an argument against them is BS.

I would think that since they can send money worldwide and go from any currency in the world to any other currency in the world, that adding another currency wouldn't take them very long.  They would just have to add the code that gives them the current BTC value, subtracts their fee, and then gives a payment.  
WU does currency exchanges every day simply by people sending USD from the US to Mexico, and then the person at the other end getting USD or Pesos, depending on what they desire.  You'd just have another output...can I get that in BTC please?  And thats just one example.  If you're sending money from country to country, its likely local currency is being used at both ends.  BTC would just be another input or output currency to WU.
The hardest part would be probably for them to get a good, reliable source for pricing in multiple currencies vs BTC.  The rest of the infrastructure I would guess is already in place.
As for the end user, ie, the person at the store, all they would really have to know is there is another currency, and to let people deposit their funds to buy BTC/send BTC to someone and have the address created print on the receipt along with the private key so the person buying could get the coins, or, if the person chooses at the other end, to get the funds in their local currency instead of BTC, or someone sending local currency and the other end getting BTC in payment after fees.
That would all happen at a higher level though.  Instead of handing over cash, they would hand over the address/privkey the BTC is sitting in.
Since they already do this for multiple currencies worldwide, not too far fetched.  I would guess getting the approval to do it and the planning would take longer than the actual changes to whatever code they use for the machines/infrastructure.
Mind you, WU probably isn't the most effective way to get or send BTC because of the fees, but it would be another option for those who don't really have a local source.  If it would be advantageous for WU to accept BTC or Fiat and then convert it for sends would be up to them, obviously.  But it would be another option to users, and another way for people to obtain BTC.

You should have the receipt for the 2k in cash, and you should have took a copy of the transaction (for your own sanity) when you bought them.  
Even if you handed cash to someone, you'd still have a record of the transaction to your address.
Thats why when it comes to taxes, you document everything.  Helping or hurting.  
If you didn't in this case, you can claim, but its risky if they say "prove it" via audit.  In that case I'd eat the loss and call it a day.

This.  Those people who think they care about the lives being ruined are nuts.  The only reason they have those programs is because the government can tax a little more to fund them.
And its not finding a way to kill it.  Its to find a way to get their proper cut.  If you could develop a form of online gambling where the accounting would be perfect and the people didn't run it offshore because they want max profits, and find a way to prevent outsiders (ie, people from countries where its not legal) from getting into it, it would be legalized right now.  In fact a lot of casinos who are really hurting right now and are sending you those cards for $25 a night off peak would be converting some of those rooms into a place to hold the servers.  It would probably keep a few of them from closing down.
Its not that they hate online gambling.  It is that it cannot be controlled like a physical casino physically sitting in a state or territory (such as indian land in California) and taxed properly-both profits and winners, automatically.  The Government hates not getting its cut, and it really hates having to track people down to get it.  They like it just like they like it out of your paycheck-right off the top, and they get it before you get yours.

I'm thinking either an external trigger (like another fork or a sudden announce of breach, somehow) or someone just getting itchy and starting a drive.
I just think the higher it gets, the higher the parlays are going-people aren't buying $500 in BTC anymore who are speculating.  Its more like 5000.  They figure a good rate of return on the street is maybe 10% or so after fees, so figure 15% appreciation.  Maybe some of them stay in a bit longer.  But then they start to itch.  Itching to take the profit.
The more people that itch and make buys and sells of that kind of magnitude, the more it bounces around, and the more people who may get nervous.  Get enough of them together and it could get weird, quick.
Sure the smart ones take it easy.  I think we're starting to see a lot of people taking positions and then taking the profit, which is going to make it more choppy.

This is totally incorrect.
You need to properly pay the IRS.  This means if you have taken profits, you need to figure out what your new tax rate will be this year.
And if you have gone over the threshold they set for income, you may have to begin paying quarterly taxes as well.  The rules for a capital gain are different than for "employment income."  Wages earned from a job are reported on a W2.  You won't be reporting Bitcoin income on a W2.
Take it from someone who knows and pays quarterlies because I own part of a small business and rental property business:
CONTACT A TAX PROFESSIONAL OR ACCOUNTANT.  DO NOT TAKE ADVICE OFF OF REDDIT.
Unless, of course, you want the IRS to penalize you, in which case they will be happy to take....all of it from you when they decide you tried to cheat them.  Its your choice.
Seek professional help, seriously.  Even if you think you know what you're doing, you don't.  The price of an accountant is much cheaper than what you'll pay if you screw up!

Yes.  There is no regulation, and Gox makes money on every transaction.
It would behoove them for stability to do so, but they don't have any authority that tells them they have to, and they make money on each one.
Its easy to see why they wouldn't do it.  Or maybe they can't with the software they are running now, who knows.
There is a pretty good reason to not prohibit them, however.  Money talks, and its not like the law is going to come get them tomorrow for them allowing an unregulated market to be played.
Banning .01 orders doesn't hurt much.  Notice the value of these?  0.6% looks pretty good when you're looking at those amounts.  Sure, they get nothing from the 0.000 ones, but you notice the few going through at that price and the amounts?

Well unless he pays the balance before the bill hits.  I have one CC that I do that to whenever I use it, mostly for Hotel Reservations (there are a lot of them who won't take a debit/credit card to secure a room).  So I just use it for that, or for a tank of gas every 3 months or so, so it stays active.  But I literally go home/online right after I do it and make a payment.  If he did it that way, then he loses no money, pays no interest, and depending on the card, might have earned points, though usually they don't do that on a cash advance.
If he had a card with that kind of availability he was doing something right.  But had he got hit for interest...most of them charge 29% on a cash advance.  Probably why he bought in and had to bail so quick, to make the payment before that happened.
Had it happened (the drop) 2 days earlier, he might be screaming.  I would have been too, I pulled my principal the day before the crash, and about 4 hours after that I saw a $50 drop and I got nervous and pulled the rest.  Course, it went back to $280, I was kicking myself, and then we all know what happened....

This right here though is what you should expect with Bitcoin.
Keep in mind that many people like it because of the lack of regulation and similar.
Because of this, you will NOT likely be seeing any disclosure.  Its not required.
The poster who replied that people are buying with credit (or "Credit/Debit") and those charges can be reversed is correct though.  
I'm betting what has happened is purchases have been made, BTC has been distributed, and then there was a $4 correction downwards.  Instead of understanding how the market for it works and waiting for it to re-increase or selling it at a loss, they instead called their credit card company, screamed fraud or similar, got their money back, and Coinbase is stuck with the chargeback.
And if they get an excessive amount of chargebacks, credit card providers could very well start limiting their ability to accept them altogether, or they could even require that settlement funds be held in escrow due to the excessive amounts seen.
Why they even took them at all is a surprise to me for this very reason.  We're dealing with unregulated trading.  I would only take cash only and expect others to do the same, honestly.

Well if you honestly think honest people will remain honest once they don't have to report to any government entity anymore, you keep on believing.
Human nature has proven time and time again that there will always be someone who wants to have the power.
Remove government from the picture, and there will be plenty of people going around taking what they want because they now have the means to do so.
People aren't going to continue to be polite to one another if they don't have to be.
If you read some of the commentary on this subreddit, there are plenty of people who would love to see the government as well as banks totally fold.  They just don't understand what they would be missing if it did really happen.
They don't really have a grasp on modern society.
A lot of them feel that access to the internet is something they should be handed and not paying for, but thats another topic entirely.
I'm speaking from the level that a lot of people on this subreddit do.  Anything good for Bitcoin=Yay!  Fuck Banks!  Fuck Paying Taxes!
I'm talking about that crowd.  Obviously most people are smarter than that.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:28:04
The problem with your suggestion is the community can't agree on anything, except maybe for things that may drive the price up (at least lately if you read this subreddit).
Do a search for Bitcoin on Google and you'll see so many differing opinions its staggering, to say the least.
You can't have a community agree when people are all over the place on it.  You have people going around trying to get places to take BTC with no intention of using BTC with them when they do.  They just want to do it so they can announce another place is taking it.  What good does that do?
Combine that with the level of scams we're suddenly seeing, all the articles about market manipulation and no regulation to stop it, and what do you think a "Community" is going to be able to come up with?
You'll be one shout in a large crowd of other people screaming, at best at this point.
Bitcoin is decentralized.  Trying to centralize opinion and charging money to do it isn't going to work.  The other screams will drown you out, and those people won't have to pay a cent to be heard.  
Take a look at the "press" Bitcoin gets.  Any schmoe who can convince themselves and some news org to be an expert on it gets airtime.
You won't have a chance.
Besides the fact I'm sure the people "in control" of BTC at this point, the coders and the miners, aren't going to pay you a cent, and they will put you down as not representing them also.  Honestly, they are what makes Bitcoin tick, and if anyone should organize to be the spokespeople for BTC, its them.

The last manipulation was because it got driven way high, and then people decided for whatever reason to buy in then, instead of lower down.
The people who lost hopefully learned from this and won't do that again.
Manipulation won't stop for sure, but you'd hope that people learned from this last one, and won't be fueling it by buying in at the peak next time.
Let the speculators do that and lose instead.   Don't buy into the hype like a lot of people did last time.
Which is probably why the next time it happens, it will be slow, gradual, and probably over a span of days or even weeks.  People are going to see large rises and think its speculation and stay out of it.
They will have to use a lot more finesse now.  The days of a quick buck are hopefully over now.  But if people keep buying in to a sudden rise, they will surely take advantage of it again.
Hopefully it opened peoples eyes and any BTC profit taking now will be gradual.  Unless people are still suckers.  Only time will tell.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:15:33
Because if you had 1btc sitting on Gox at $230, and then they closed the exchange, and it fell to $150, you'd be mighty pissed, lag or no lag, that you couldn't sell it while it was still around $190, even with the lag.
Then you'd be on here cussing Gox because they suspended trading until it was $150 and you lost all that money.
At least with the lag, if you put the sell order in and someone bites, you're out less.  
If Gox suspended trading, you'd be screaming class action lawsuit.
Unless of course you're one of the ones who sold at $240 and waited for everyone to panic, then rebought at $130.  Then you're smiling and hoping they never change.
Hopefully people will wake the heck up now and realize that maybe exchanges running on year 2000 technology aren't going to work with a massive price fluctuation.

Well what caused me to not renew is when they updated their privacy policy about 8 months ago or so, and it was implied that if they got a warrant, they would furnish data.
It was asked of them if they had the ability to decrypt data on their systems, they said yes, but they would only do it if asked to by a court order.
I didn't like the fact that they could do it in the first place, whats to stop someone there from doing so just for kicks?
Like I said I didn't have anything on there I really cared about, but I'd prefer to use a service where only my computers are holding the keys, and they don't have that ability.
@_date: 2013-04-11 23:29:46
I think a lot of it depends on Gox and the other exchanges.
If they just reopen with no comments, not saying they are going to do things to prevent the .01 trades, it keeps going down.
If they do something about it (and hopefully the others follow suit, or they will be the next targets) then it could rebound.  I don't see it going to $200 in a flash though.  $100 maybe in a few weeks, but I think any growth from now on is going to be slow, and any rapid rises will be seen as speculation and people simply won't buy in, they will let them hang themselves.
But if Gox, et al just shrugs and lets it happen again, we may be getting that low.  People aren't going to buy like they did before, for sure, especially if they don't do anything about it.
There is an obvious problem, and like the fork issue, if they don't put something out there fairly quickly to try to curb it, its not going to bode well for price, in general.
I'm still seriously wondering about Gox's liquidity though.  Seems odd that it gyrated for a few hours before they closed the exchange "for the sake of stopping the massive fluctuations."  All the charts I'm looking at showed they made a lot of money for quite a few hours before they finally stopped "for the sake of Bitcoin."  It seems fishy to me.  I'm probably just being a conspiracy theorist there, but it seems weird.

Plus when you say leave 20K on the table, it would be more like leaving 12k on the table because interest is taxable as hell, which is part of the reason PART of my investment strategy is to take less interest.  I'm already taking it in the neck due to taxes, the last thing I need to do is increase my gross income 20k and get into the NEXT higher tax bracket.

Well you would likely go to a document or something showing you possessed the keys, etc.  Which is the same thing you do with a house, car, or other property, you usually have a receipt. 
The problem with Bitcoin is anyone can generate such a document and there is no way to prove it genuine.  With a house you have a deed, with a car you have a pink slip or registration, when you buy something from a store you have a receipt with a date on it indicating where you bought it, what register, who was running the register, the time of the transaction, etc.  Bitcoin has none of this.
Its truly an honor system, which works as long as everyone involved is honorable.  The moment someone isn't, you run into issues, like you said.  Sure you have the blockchain, but because there are no refunds, only the latest iteration (or the iteration at the time you made the transaction, provided another wasn't made following it) show that your address holds the coins.
Provided of course you can prove ownership of said address holding said coins, of course.  Bitcoin will be a really good test of the "possession is 9/10ths of the law" rule.  Especially when hashing technology gets to the point that its better to mine addresses for private keys versus mining the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:21:32
Only for as long as it stays down.  If it gets back up to $200+ they will be back.  Especially if the exchanges don't fix the issue that allows people to enmass trade .01 to drive the price.
If Bitcoin was regulated, there would be a full investigation.  But its not, so its up to the exchanges as a whole.
Even if Gox fixes itself, if the others don't in turn, you'll see it again on one of them.  
But even if Gox raises the floor to say, .10, thats nothing to a speculator.  Probably will have to institute some kind of limit per account as well, ie, one trade every 15 minutes or something.
Even if they do fix it, it will be the confidence of everyone who decides if its worth buying when its high again.  Having seen Gox's track record, I'm betting it won't be seen as trustworthy at first.
But you never know.  I was lucky and sold out 2 days ago at $200.  I got nervous, I saw nothing propping it, then I watched it go to $280 and kicked myself.  Then I watched it go the other way.  Went to bed last night, got up this morning and its under $100.
Its all a guessing game, and what may happen next is anyones guess.  You'd hope it would go back up so people who lost a lot would gain it back, but then you just get another group of people buying who will lose if it happens again.
Some people like to gamble a lot more than me, for sure.

The only thing is that right now your jellybean, if you sell it for a million bucks, is worth a million bucks.
If you refuse and someone offers you $6, and you take it, then its worth $6.
Bitcoin is fine and good as long as everyone who has one and wants to sell it agrees its worth whatever MtGox is showing its worth is fine.
If tomorrow everyone wakes up and says "no, I think they are worth twice as much" thats fine, but if nobody is buying, is it really worth that much?
You could say that about any kind of money honestly, but the difference with other types of money is that usually there is some kind of government backing or similar "bolstering" the value.
BTC is a gentlemans agreement, and all it takes is one large gentleman holding a lot of them to massively sell to cause a fluctuation.
Or some kind of flaw suddenly happening to cause the confidence of the holders to not be confident.
That makes things a little different with it.  Its why a lot of people like it, but there is always that chance that what is shown as the price today won't be what it is tomorrow.
The main concept of buying and selling is if you have something to sell, someone has to be willing to pay the price you are wanting for it.  If not, you can take less or it is worthless.
So what do you base the value on when you report it?  What MtGox said at the time you did it, or because there was a sudden "correction" and now that $92/btc is worth $45/btc....what do you report?
Sure if you sell stocks or other things, you'd report the amount of gain.  But is a Bitcoin "exchange" proof enough you're misreporting?  
@_date: 2013-03-05 18:21:22

I'm guessing it will affect their reserve accounts pretty fast, and since those accounts hold BTC and Fiat in the amounts at the time trading was suspended, once trading opens, suddenly the BTC in those accounts is worth a lot less, and they allowed people to take or transfer Fiat for coins they probably had just sold for that price.
They are going to take a pretty big hit, value wise, the moment the exchange reopens.  They have to have some skins in the game themselves.
Unless of course they pushed THEIR orders to sell through before suspending or something similar.
I'm also starting to wonder if they ran out of liquidity and they stopped trading because people were massively transferring out...it seems odd that you would let trading go on as long as they did and suddenly you stop it.  It was bouncing around for a while before they finally "halted" trading.  You'd think if they wanted to stop the slide they would have when it got there in the first place.  It sounds to me like it was bouncing around, and people were bailing out and selling and moving their money out, and suddenly they had a BTC or cash shortfall.

I have mentioned it quite a few times in this group and got flamed for it.
Did I make money "trading" Bitcoin?  Yep.  About 8 grand.  Will I be reporting it?  Sure.  I make 250k/year.  I have a lot to lose if I falsify a tax return.  They can fine me and they know I have the money to pay it.
But I believe in letting people believe what they want to believe.  Freedom of thought.  They flame me nicely when I bring it up, that I'm stupid for reporting it.  
I have my reasons.  If they don't want to report it, fine.  Maybe the IRS won't find out.  But if they do, with me, they aren't going to find anything wrong because I reported it properly.
At my tax rate last year, I'll lose about 33% of that 8 grand.  Thats better than all of it plus penalties.
Some other people, if they practice what they preach on here, will likely be discovering what I"m talking about the hard way.  Thats their right, they are free to think they are anonymous enough on Bitcoin that nobody is going to notice their trades.
To me, its cheaper to be honest.  Lying to the IRS is a costly thing.

The problem I have with it is the fact that people aren't very well educated on the risk of it, or the risk of using online services that could very well lose your money, just like you say in both examples.
Bitcoins major selling point to a lot of people is that it is a way to leave your bank behind.
My point is if people continue to lose money in such fashion, it is not going to look good for Bitcoin, reasons be damned.  People won't care why it happened, all they will see is that there is no recourse for the people who had this happen to them.

Depends on the attorney I suppose.
I'm only going off experience.  When I got divorced and retained an attorney, the first thing he told me was to keep my mouth shut, do not take calls from anyone on her side of the family, and if I took a call from someone who started in on me about her or discussed her for any reason except for him (my attorney), I was to say nothing.
I've heard of it in many criminal cases as well.
Course, there could be other reasons for silence, but not knowing whats going on, I would have to assume if there are legal issues regarding their closure, an attorney caused gag order is a pretty high possibility.  Its also possible they took the money and ran or some other reason, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that they are not doing it purposely.
I could be entirely wrong.  Why not, I've been off on almost every prediction I've made about the price of BTC as well, except my last sell before the crash, which I didn't predict, I just did by gut feeling.

Then perhaps more explanation to new users is in order.
Because these people seem to be in a tizzy suddenly that they are short 20btc.  They probably wouldn't be had they been lead to believe how secure the currency supposedly is.
A major selling point of Bitcoin is that you can leave your traditional, greedy bank behind.  At least my greedy bank makes me sign forms that explain to me that losses could occur in investments that I make unless they are properly insured.
I think a lot of people are buying into Bitcoin because they think its cool, or they think its a good way to make some money, but they are surely doing so without the proper education they need to make sound decisions like pulling their money back out after making transactions, etc.
And if this kind of thing continues on, its not going to help Bitcoin in the future.
@_date: 2013-02-19 02:02:54
I'm sure they are quaking in their million dollar boots.
The fact that people charge things and are willing to pay any percentage on it is silly in itself, but people do it all the time.
Been on a cash-only basis for years and love it.  Interest payments are good on tangible investments like houses and cars.  Even then though you should be seeking the lowest rate.
But slapping down a card to pay interest on that $3.50 latte at Starbucks this morning is just plain silly.
People do that all the time though.
@_date: 2013-02-28 21:22:05
Just like the stock market, you shouldn't be putting money into Bitcoin that you cannot afford to TOTALLY lose.
If you are doing it for an investment that is.  If you're buying a few BTC to buy something online with it, as long as you do it fairly quick, the value shouldn't affect you very much.
But if you're investing with your rent check, you're already doing it wrong.
The stock market is the same way, even though with E-Trade and similar you can set triggers on stocks to autosell at a level, you still should not be dropping money into it that you cannot afford to lose.

Yes you can.  Paypal is a great example.
The difference is that these kind of things, being no fault of Bitcoin itself, will place it into a negative light.  Especially if the loss is not only a glitch.
Paypal can weather such a storm.  If sites like this using Bitcoin keep doing this, it will doom the model.
Like I said, more education should be in order.  I'm not sure about it being marketed as being secure either.  Probably should be more education on the ways it can be kept as such, perhaps.
I'd like to see wordpress start taking it as an example, but they would use a payment processor to do so.  I doubt they will dedicate an employee to sit there daily and move payments out to a secure wallet each day as well, which is probably why they haven't pulled the trigger.
If the payment processors don't clean up their acts, people will never go for it.  Even if its only isolated incidents.
It doesn't put confidence in it for sure.  And with Bitcoin in its infancy, if they continue to market it without telling people how to be safe with it, it will be its downfall as well.

Bitcoin will survive, I don't doubt that.  It may not go mainstream like everyone preaches on here, but its already has its uses.  Those people will stick with it.
I don't think driving people to use it is what is going to work though.  I think people simply need to discover it.  The ones who like the concept will adopt.  Trying to "sell" it to people isn't going to work though.
There may be still a few speculators in the game, but I'm guessing that they have already pulled out.  Why?  Because you take your loss and go speculate on something else.  The very essence of a day trader is that they don't own anything for long.  They win, they lose.  This loss to them is just another.  They will go elsewhere and try to win it back.  They are in it for the rush and the profit, not to wait to "recoup their losses."  Losses are something that wind up on a balance sheet to offset taxes at the end of the year on the stuff they won at.

Usually though in a situation like this, the attorney for the defendant would be the one giving the statement.  If they refuse to, I guess someone else could.
Depends on whats going on.  The only other thing I can think of is that they are actually being detained, which would prevent announcements as well.  Can't do much announcing from a jail cell, though usually lawyers will also push for bail.  So maybe they can't come up with it, or something else is up.  
Unless all the money is tied up in the account that is now frozen and they don't have any collateral that allows a bond to be issued.
Many possibilities.  I don't think they are doing it on purpose which is why I think its the attorneys.  But who knows.

Because they are entirely different things.
The DDOS is being used by people outside of Gox to manipulate the price and cause profits.
However, the DDOS also causes Gox to make money, thus they aren't doing anything about it.
Thus they are happy with the status quo.  They aren't making improvements to their frontend simply because its more profitable to them to do so.
I'm not saying Gox is DDOSing itself, I'm saying market manipulators are.
I'm saying however that Gox isn't doing shit about it because they make money on it.  Thus, they like it, and it continues because it benefits both people doing it.  The people doing it for whatever reason, and Gox because every time it happens, trading volume goes up for a bit.
Statement one is the DDOS by the speculators to drive up volume and volatility.  (a side benefit is the increase in volume).
Statement two is Gox not doing anything about it, because they are making money on it.

You should expect this....Bitcoin is unregulated.
And because of that unregulation, obviously people are going to do whatever they can to play the market.
If it means taking a .6% hit to drive the price up another dollar before selling a few thousand, its more than worth the price.
Its not something someone selling 10btc back and forth would do, but 100btc makes it profitable for sure.
And if you watch carefully, it only takes one bot to drive the price up, and a few hundred people could be selling when it hits that price point.  Its probably benefiting regular schmoes just as much as the bigger players.
Provided they catch it at the right moment.
Heck, if they drive it back up beyond $190 later today, I'll be buying something from bitcoinstore once I see they are taking 1btc for that price.  So it may benefit me too.

Been preaching that in threads for months.  Its preached in many forms.  Never invest what you cannot afford to lose.  I wasn't the only one screaming it.  But people bragged of taking money out on credit cards.  They were told it was a mistake.  They told us to go screw.
Keep preaching, but those pleas were on deaf ears just 2 days ago.  It was all a game.  Right up until the moment people started losing real money.

It just seemed awfully fishy at the time, so I moved my fish to another pond, is all I'm saying.
And since a good segment of BTC users like BTC because they can "stay under the radar" they might want to know that using Dropbox may result in their data on it "not staying there."  
Especially since Blockchain.info and others can backup wallet data to it.  They may think it works fine, but may not realize that Dropbox could share it if so prompted by the appropriate authorities.

There is a very strong possibility that if something legal is going on that they CANNOT tell.
Legal counsel, if retained or not, would probably be the first to tell you to SAY NOTHING.
If this is the case, its likely any announcements will be done via the legal team (if they have one) or the prosecution later.
Just like when you get in a car wreck, you don't admit fault.  And if you got caught doing something, a public announcement would incriminate you.  Your legal team would likely walk as well if you eliminate your only potential for defense.
The only thing you can infer from their silence is that something happened where they cannot or will not talk about it.  You've already stepped in a pile of something, no need to track it all around.  
If I was their attorney I'd be furious if they said something after I advised them to direct all questions to counsel, for sure.  And counsel at this point, if they said anything, would likely say.....no comment right now.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:32:37
Thanks.  But I'll be honest-when I bought in, I bought in to buy a computer, which was around $25 or so per BTC at the time.
I found a better deal and moved it to an offsite wallet.  I puckered at $49, sold, then it dropped to $34 the same day.  I hadn't moved my money out yet, so I rebought.  It got to around $55, I sold again, I took my profits, then it fell to around $42.  I bought back in and then the massive climb began.  I kinda sat and watched it.  Sold a bit around $200 to recoup what I had in, watched it bounce around a bit again, started seeing $30 swings (it went up to 240 a few days ago, then dropped near $200, then back to close to $250, woke up the next morning it was $210....)
I folded at that point.  I didn't like the swings.
I honestly would have folded a lot sooner if I had not took my initial money out prior to that.  I was going to hold like a Spartan, since at that point I was playing with house money.  Then it stayed on my mind and I pussied out about 4 hours later.  I couldn't leave it sitting on the table.
So congrats to me, but honestly, if it had kept going, I probably would have kicked myself.  And in fact it did, I think it hit $260 before it went down yesterday at one point.  But once I sold out, I stopped watching it like a hawk.  
But I'll be honest.  I pussied out.  I handed over my Spartan shield.  I didn't know the day after it would do what it was going to do.

Because Paypal takes a lot more than that.  Have you seen the percentages lately?
They totally gank people both ways.
Nevermind their "Resolution" of disputes, where people get items, claim they never did, and get their money back, no questions asked.  Or the other away around, where some seller ships then cancels the shipment of something and keeps your money.
I'd rather buy direct with BTC from some unknown person then Paypal.  
@_date: 2013-01-04 18:22:19
Because winnings of over $600 must be reported to the IRS.
Online gambling sites or sites using bitcoin won't report such wins and thus the government cannot take their fair share of the winnings as dictated by the United States Tax Code.
Also, the states tend to get a smidge of it also.
In states where gambling is legal in casinos (including Indian) the profits are taxed as well.  In California agreements are made on this for Indian Casinos.
It is because of the taxes not being collected.  A state controlled lottery will surely report winnings.
Seals with Clubs (as an example) doesn't even want your email.
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:50:05
Just did another post about this.
I don't think it will be negative, but it will be interesting to see how the government reacts to it.  I don't think they will ignore it once the winnings get into the taxable realm.
How they would stop it I have no idea.  They can't shut it down like they told Visa and Mastercard to do.

As far as I remember there were no fees for moving BTC.  Moving fiat...it varied.  Thats why I was careful before I made moves, buys and sells.

There may be fees though if you do a lot of moves in a day.  I never did that many.

You'll pay a fee somewhere.  You'd have to shop around to see who has the lowest.

Depends on the item and who is doing it.  If its from Amazon direct, usually they win.  If its from someone selling through them, then you often get the eBay effect:  Good price, but they are going to charge you pretty good for shipping, even the cheap way.

You don't own it either.  Its not a physical item, its virtual.
Just like a character on an online game.  If the server crashes and there is no backup....
It exists via the continued work of others.  If all the miners called it a day, you couldn't do a thing with it.

I didn't start with BTC for a quick buck.  I actually started with it because I found a really good deal for a computer system.  At the time, BTC was $25ish, so I bought some so I could buy the computer.
It took a bit for the payment to clear, and in the meantime I found an even better deal, so I went with it, and the BTC I wound up with I just moved to my home computer and basically didn't do much with it.
Then I check on it a bit later and suddenly its close to $38, so I sold it, figured I made a profit on it, but I kept an eye on it.  It dropped to $24ish so I took what I had taken out and rebought.
Then it got close to 48, and I sold again.  Then it dropped to around 38 again, and went up to 60ish.  Sold again.  It dropped to $50 and I bought back in, and this time I basically doubled my money down (I had about 2000 of my money in it at this point, I raised it to 4000, plus I had made 6000 so my stake at this point was 10k.  Each time prior to that when I rebought, I added a few hundred bucks, usually to make the amounts even in USD.)
I then rode it to 200.  At that point I bailed out my 10k (~45btc) and had 155 left.  I sat on it for a few hours and watched it go to 250, and then dropped to 200.  I bailed out at that point.
The next day was the big drop day.
I started as an adopter to spend.  Then it started climbing, and then the drops were enough to justify rebuying in.
It started as a spending vehicle and ended up as an investment.
My primary intention was to buy stuff with it, but then it did what it did.
I have maybe 10BTC now floating around in a few accounts that I used to make some small purchases. The rest is out now.
Will I go back in?  I'm on the fence.
But I didn't, at least at the beginning, intend for it to be an investment.  I have other investments, BTC never even was half a percentage point of what I have invested by other means (at least by the amount of money I, myself, put into it), even at the end.  It just worked out that way.
The gains BTC saw could never be matched by anyone on the street, and never probably will be.  The most I had seen in any of my investments was 15% in a year.  I quadrupled my money basically.
I have a feeling a lot of people started like me, and ended up making the quick buck.
You can't turn a blind eye to that kind of increase.  Never.

Its easier for them to just block it.
Its also possible a lot of people made transfers, and then the crash happened they got a lot of calls trying to reverse stuff-which may also have caused it to be flagged.
Credit cards will usually call about suspect usage, but a bank normally doesn't call.
If they aren't letting you do it, I'd say they had too many bad transactions with them-and thus its easier to say no than to possibly lose money later or have to chargeback.
@_date: 2013-01-12 18:50:23
I don't see how this is so serious.  If you use the original client, it won't let you spend unconfirmed coins.
If you choose to use outside clients or online wallets and they let you...well, that will be on them then.  Someone will have to cover the fraud loss and since online wallets sometimes send transactions via their own internal wallets to satisfy user sends....
Once they get bit a few times in the ass they will change to the standard that you can't spend unconfirmed too.
Sometimes people just have to learn the hard way.  They will.
And if you are willing to take a payment and send goods before confirmation, well....thats on you.  I would view it just like any credit card or similar transaction-until its confirmed, nothings happening.

Its under attack because those who don't use central banks for obvious reasons started using Bitcoin.
What you're seeing here is the same thing you saw when they discovered money being laundered by other means.
It will probably move to Litecoin or something else next, if they ever get a few exchanges, last a few months, same results.
There are people out there with a need to move large sums of money without government detection.  Once the detection is made, they take care of the issue.
You can blame central banks, but the bottom line is the bottom line-a good part of the infusion and price of Bitcoin is for less than legal uses.  Once this was discovered and verified, the government moves to stop it.
Just like they would any other crime, although ones that affect revenue and the avoidance of taxes do get their attention more.
BTC will eventually start to fall slowly as these people can no longer use it, or have to use it in smaller transactions to attempt to avoid detection as well.
There is plenty of history of this.  Seeing the gambling sites take off taking Bitcoin was another sign as well.  You knew the government, especially the US, wouldn't just let it happen.
I'm honestly surprised it took them that long, since that was done out in the open and without any attempt at concealment.
And you can't blame the exchanges for doing this.  When you take a percent or two off every transaction, you're helping people move money-but making money yourself.  Greed carries on in all aspects of life.  Including here.  They took the money, they made their percentage passing it on.  Now they are getting caught.
@_date: 2013-02-23 19:35:49
You will probably have to adjust your price with the price of bitcoin.
How you do this will be your decision, but obviously if you want it to be in your favor, you'll want to do it in a fashion that you're not following the peaks of the price, seeing that BTC can bounce around a few dollars either way.
Either that or you can set a price I suppose and just hope it stays high.  But if it goes from 30 like it is now to 50, people will probably look to you to adjust a bit.

Thought about buying back in, but seeing Gox flashing 130's....no thanks.  Maybe after the lag leaves and we see where its at.  
Everyone else is around $180 which is probably the true price.  But who knows how many people took a hit today and might bail the moment they make a few bucks/btc.
There are probably some people just hoping it gets back to where they started right now, and they will be hastily exiting once it does, if it does.

I'm not into that stuff either which is why I have an accountant/financial advisor.
But I came into this job having come from ones that were pretty paltry and didn't pay well, and I had to borrow from family to make ends meet.  So when I was in the position to not ever have to do that again, I jumped on it.
Everyone has their own reasoning, of course.

The inability to identify who they were doing this on behalf of is probably the trigger.
Most of those kind of things are monitored for two reasons: Illicit transactions, and for tax purposes.
I'm sure if they were asked to cough up ID for the transactors they couldn't do so either, that probably is a violation of quite a few tax codes as well.
Probably why they don't have a list of charges yet-they are still compiling them.
In the US, if you do such a transaction the bank(s) involved are required to have some form of ID to tie to them.
I couldn't do my last property settlement ($16k down) without ID-even though my bank knows who I am and has my tax information, I had to complete a form and show it again before they would issue me the cashiers check to give at the paperwork signing.  I also had to state on the form what the transaction was for.
I don't know what the laws are there but I'm betting they are similar.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:29:36
It will only work if ALL the exchanges agree to do so.
Since they all didn't, trading carries on and it falls lower.
Once Gox unfreezes, nobody is getting $120+ for a BTC, and they will fall to the level of others.
There are probably a lot of Gox customers upset right now because they didn't get the chance to sell at a point before where it is now.
I don't see Gox honoring the $120 value, which means while others can trade and take what they can, people on Gox are stuck, they can do nothing.

True, but I think they wouldn't bother if it wasn't.

More like buy bitcoins, wait for them to appreciate, spend less of them on items.
An item I had been looking at on Bitcoinstore today will be 1btc or less if we hit 190 again, I'm keeping an eye on it.  If we get there, I'll be buying.
But then again I have 200BTC for investment purposes, and about 15 or so floating around in a few wallets that I have used to buy stuff before.

All it takes is one incident where the bank "could" be named as part of it to cause them to do that.

Ideally it should be done right as the transaction is being done.
With the swings you're seeing, one minute they may be worth $20 more than the next.
As everyone else has said, Bitpay will mitigate this, just be aware of the fees involved.  Your shopkeeper might have to adjust prices to compensate, although I'm guessing Bitpay would be around the same percentage as the credit card processor already in use.

They are a weakness on the internet today.  The average user will get coins stolen and will thus not adopt Bitcoin.
Which is fine with you, looks like.  Works for me also.  But as much as people spout on here about making it mainstream, its not going to work in its current incarnation.  Too many stories already of people having coins stolen to have that happen.
If people want it to replace banks like OP is implying, its going to have to be idiot proof.  Otherwise, banks and fiat aren't going anywhere like he is dreaming of.

I mean either way it wasn't very well executed-but I think .01 BTC to be considered for an interview is kinda like those contests on the radio they have where you win 9.85 as part of the prize because you're listening to 98.5 or something like that.  
Course the whole idea of paying to be considered is far fetched as well.  I guess it could have been worse, they could have put a standard disclaimer at the bottom: "No purchase required.  Odds of winning 1:100000000."

Coinstar makes their money on the same business model as Walmart (and others who are following suit, like Target).
They prey on the lazy.
People don't want to go to 10 different stores anymore.  They want one stop shopping.
And that means they will eat a 10% fee to turn their coins in.  Why?  They are already at Walmart.  
Its the same reason Redbox is in front of places like it.  One stop, you have everything you need.  Groceries, beer, your coin jar emptied, and a movie to watch after dinner.
Sure its a ripoff, but people do it anyway.  They don't want to go to another place.  Its the same reason many banks have set up small branches in Grocery Stores.

30k people voting to make it a payment option, at least if I was Dropbox, tells me there are 30k potential customers.
But what if, say, my small company in a year or so goes to Dropbox and says "hey, how is that Bitcoin adoption going for you?"
Are they going to say it helped them, or are they going to say "meh.  All these people voted on it.  We got about 500 people to use it, but we expected a lot more since 30k people screamed for it."
What do you think I'm going to think about that?  Or how about another big player like Amazon?
If you think voting alone gets this done, it doesn't.  Good companies check around, see what their competition is doing.  If its a major positive, they may go for it.
If its just a minor flash in the pan, no matter how easy it is, they may think its not worth it.
I vote with my dollars, not because I want some company to take Bitcoin.  Like I said, I'll vote if it would be something I would use BTC on.  But I don't plan on paying for Dropbox, so a vote for it to me is deceptive.

I agree with you.  The only reason hes pumping up Bitcoin is because his newest venture takes it, and hes out for that before anything.
I don't think he'll hurt Bitcoin publicity wise in the long run, but his motives are not to help Bitcoin.  They are to help himself.
And with the legal issues hes having, it sounds like hes going to need some cash.

Bitfloor.  The other two were okay, but I preferred Bitfloor. 
I had the other two in there though because sometimes the variance in price was more than a few dollars, and honestly at first I didn't know what I was doing.  I started with BTCe, but grew to like Bitfloor.  But I kept the others-sometimes they would have a better price and it was by more than a few bucks.
I know you already mentioned prior that you'd move your coins off, but I want to reiterate that unless you're actively trading, don't leave your coins on any of them.  I have left USD on Gox, but that was only until I could move it off due to the limits.  I never leave BTC on any of them longer than it takes for the transaction to go.
If you're going to spend BTC you'll want to make addresses and move the funds to them before sending.  If you get addresses with a lot of sends and puts they usually want higher fees or you may run into problems with processing as well.

Also if you have the port forwarding enabled so you can send others the blockchain, you may get lag.
If you do that, you probably will want to get a program that limits upload speed as well, as I've seen it easily consume half of a DS2 connection before on my personal machine.
If you don't know what this is, you don't have to worry about it-if you don't open the port on your router, you won't be uploading.

Whats your risk factor?
I'd say don't buy in right now unless you can stand a bit of a loss.
But honestly its a gamble.  I'm holding on to 250ish BTC I bought at 14, but if it starts falling quick I may bail on it.
I bailed on 150ish at 9 when it hit 26, roughly, not thinking it could sustain, and then it proved me wrong at 30, I didn't think it would get there.
If you're purely buying for investment power, I'd say to hold off till it slides a bit.  But to what....I couldn't tell you.
I think a slippage at this point to under 25 means someone is dumping or something is up.  There have been big dips, but usually not more than $5 or so.  At least from what I've seen.

And they do ban people for doing this.  They have been doing it for years.  And if I recall correctly, if you try to select other options for payment, they will nag you that you should use paypal instead.
I haven't used it in a few years, but from what I recall of it, if you're going to discuss other payment options, you better do it outside of ebay, and you'll have to come up with a way to complete the auction as well, though if you offer other options I guess you can just mark it completed and paid and do the whole rating thing.
They really push paypal which is a reason I haven't used it in a long time.  My hatred for paypal stopped me from using it and a few other things as well.

I have found that giving transactions .0005 or .0001 doesn't change the processing time.  But no fee transactions can languish for quite a while.
I'm guessing as Bitcoin gets busier though and has more transactions, you'll really start seeing priority given to larger fee transactions, and the ones with lesser fees will process, but probably during quieter blocks, which means you'll see it in a day or two.

Because its not illegal to gamble.
Its illegal to gamble and not properly report winnings in excess of $600 to the IRS for proper taxation by the government.
Also, depending on the state or local jurisdiction, they may be owed their share as well.
Gambling for example is legal in Nevada, but any winnings over $600 won at a legitimate casino will be reported to the IRS.
If you gamble offshore or outside of the US and win anything in excess of $600 USD you are supposed to declare it as well, though its likely such places won't report it.
This is why the government has a problem with gambling, besides in the jurisdictions where it is illegal-they aren't getting their proper cut.
Once they figure out a way to tax bitcoin casinos, you'll see this happening too.  Its going to bring attention to bitcoin that people aren't going to like.  Once the figures start getting above $600 frequently you'll start seeing online casinos get threatened, and/or places that allow you to buy bitcoin to play at same.

Yep, he probably needed a few days to get some more funds withdrawn from whatever payment processor he used before ditching.
Friend of mine had this happen to him from a shell provider a few years back, he ran a small IRC network.  He had 3 shells on this provider, $30 a month (per shell account).  Suddenly they have a special, 6 months for $90.  The place had been in business close to 3 years.  50% discount, but you have to prepay for the 6 months.
So of course a lot of people ordered it.  Everything was fine for about 40 days.  Then people started reporting that tech support had vanished.  Suddenly 45 days into it the shells go down.  Well, it turned out their internet connection went off because they hadn't paid it.  Someone who lived fairly close went to the "storefront" they had it running out of, the door was locked with a eviction notice on it, he took a picture and posted it.
I guess the people they leased the boxes from got in there before the landlord did and got to recover their servers, but the money and the people had flown the coop.  Later on they figured that the people running it had used assumed names.  And the address they had given people as a physical address supposedly in the town was a gas station.
So they set it up, ran it for a while (remotely probably, once the infrastructure was in place they could) and once they decided to quit, they decided to go out with a bang.
Nobody knows how many people ordered the "special offer" before they split, though they supposedly had 10 or so servers for IRCd shell accounts, and a few others for Eggdrop bots as well.
I'm trying to remember the name of it now but it escapes me.
I actually met the guy (my friend) a few years prior to this happening because the small company I partially own started as a shell provider, but we stopped selling new accounts after 6 months because IRC networks, especially new ones, tend to spam and get nailed by DDOS a lot.  
We switched to hosting servers for small businesses and leasing computers instead. 
I felt bad about the entire thing though because when we got down to 20 or so accounts, we emailed them all and told them that we were going to terminate operations as a shell provider in 3 months and we suggested 2 other providers, one of them being the one that did this.

Correct but the money situation wasn't caused by the banks, it was caused by the government of the country.
The fact they took it isn't correct, but they didn't take it from the banks because the banks screwed up.  A seizure is a bit different than a robbery, or bank mis-management.  
I mean seriously, if some guy in a military vehicle came to your door with a small squad of guys armed to the teeth, and they said they wanted 10% of the stuff in your house, you could resist and die, or let them take it.
Its not like you went out and gambled 10% of your stuff away, or the bank did something stupid to lose your deposit.  The government demanded it.

I'm probably slightly bigger.  I also had roughly 110 @ 9 which I sold at 25.  I felt with that I had to pull the trigger so to speak.
You can invest less than 5k.  Etrade will let you.  I'd have to look but I think they let you start with as little as $500.  Course, you will be paying $10 a trade.  I use them and have been really satisfied.  Course, compared to Bitcoin, I have a lot more in the market.
The $100ish in BTC was a purchase I made about 15 months ago, I had intended to use it for small purchases with BTC online.  I bought the 200ish purely as an investment, to test the waters so to speak.
I figure worst case if I do decide to sell it, especially if it starts falling rapidly, I'll probably drop back down to 100btc and hold it for that purpose.  
But if it does go higher all bets are off, so to speak.

The main thing is, probably a 25% crash would turn into this or more, because the human psyche would see a loss, and people will panic, driving it further.
It depends on what the mental drop level is.  Thus far you see daily drops and it just rebounds.  But if it ever hits the level where people think "oh shit" thats when you'll get this type of correction.
Likely fueled by speculators.  Where we're at now, there can be nothing but that propping it there at this point.  Has to be people buying in that have a few bucks.  It wouldn't be going up this fast.  I went to bed last night and it was $191.  $40 in ~12 hours?  Has to be speculation.
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:23:00
The question is:  Did the people who bought in do it to covert and stay, or did they buy in waiting for it to get up as high as this peak, then sell and take profits?
If its the former it will sustain.  If its the latter, the moment it hints at a drop of a dollar or so, it will correct, and that may hurt a few people.
I bought 50btc to keep around for online buying at 42 a bit ago.  Going to hold this time.  If it gets to $75 though, it will eat at me again.
But I think the market is too dynamic now to buy 250 like I did before and sold at $48.  Everyone is saying this level is sustainable.   Maybe I will be proved wrong, but I just don't see it being held up perm.  There are people holding coins at much lower levels and every dollar it goes up, the temptation to take profit is higher and higher.  If it pops they will kick themselves, so you're going to start seeing people selling slowly to hedge their bets the more it climbs.
They will have to.  They will kick themselves for not doing so if it suddenly doesn't sustain where it is.

And therin lies the problem with your theory.
Bitcoins are totally virtual.  As long as other people are willing to buy the virtual coin from you, then they are worth something.
But if a bunch of people holding them decide suddenly that they have a feeling this is no longer the case, or the willingness of people to buy them suddenly goes down, then you could in theory be holding onto something that could be totally worthless tomorrow.
Will it keep climbing?  Probably.  But the higher it goes, the more the temptation for those holding them for a while to dump-simply because they see people buying and willing to buy.
We could very well also be one major fork or other similar issue away from it totally going down as well.
Sure it looks great and feels great.  But I got out at $48 a few days before the fork, and it lost 20% of its value before rebounding that night.  Those kind of shifts when you get closer to $100 will make more people panic.  A $10 shift is pretty bad, a $20 shift will scare people.  Bad.
Bitcoin isn't like a commodity you can equate supply and demand to.  Its virtual, and the only thing sustaining the price is people willing to buy and sell at the price specified.  The moment people don't want to....panic can ensue. 
I'm honestly surprised the way Gox and similar has slowed during heavy trading hasn't scared people more either.  You could be holding BTC at $55 and a drop starts from $60, so you put in your sell order when you see it falling, and instead of getting a few bucks profit, you lose money.  It will open some eyes when some major holder reaches their tipping point and dumps a few thousand on the market.
With the lack of scaleability, your theories are good, but in a panic the system won't be able to handle the trades and people are going to lose badly.  Then we'll see what happens.  The BTC trading houses don't have the horsepower to keep up like major players do.  People are going to lose and lose badly due to these delays, and all MtGox/et al will be able to do is shrug.

@_date: 2013-04-11 18:07:49
It became that.  When you buy a few hundred for whatever reason when its low, and suddenly its up 100, 200, 300, even 400% in some cases, you start to look at it not for the purchasing power it was originally for, but as an investment.
You can't turn a blind eye to those kind of gains.  The best return I've ever got on anything prior to Bitcoin was 15%, and I doubt I will ever see anything above that ever again.
It would have been asinine for me to not take those kind of profits, and many did so.  Including myself.  Did I make millions?  No.  I have 99% of my money in other investments.
But I did make some off of it.  You can call it greed, but honestly, its a simple human reaction.  What was worth $2000 one day, $10000 a week later, and $35000 a week after that.....
You take it.  And you run.  And you run HARD.  And you just hope that after you took it, it didn't go up another 100%.  Which for me, it didn't, though at one point I could have had 50k.  I just got uncomfortable around $200 and got out then.
I'm not going to sit here and say I made the right call, but that was my limit.  Other people likely rode it to the top.  Other people likely bought in near the top.
But you only make the money once you cash it in.  Some people saw visions of $1000/btc.  I didn't even imagine $200, which is why I bailed.
Greed is a hard thing to combat.  But you really cannot blame people for taking it.  Especially those who bought in at such a low level.  You can't blame people for seeing a small investment balloon and taking profit.

The speculators are long gone.  What you're seeing now is lower time speculation, maybe.
But I honestly think what you're seeing now is people who got in long ago, or even miners, just taking out their usual little bit, and because people are pretty jumpy right now, they are following the trend around.
A pure speculator though isn't into anything for a few hundred bucks though.  The pumpers and dumpers did their thing a few days ago.

What happens is that the company you do it through likely suffers, as is going on here.
But, lets say that company DID keep records of things like....IP addresses.  Accounts that money came from, etc.
That is where they will catch people who may have went over the threshold.  They won't bother with the smaller ones.  But if you have a few people who moved or made a ton of money, it would be worth investigating.  Sure, some of these people will be legit and report their profits.
Tax agencies, depending on the location, have pretty broad powers.  The IRS has been known to audit and find "irregularities" in a tax return, and then the auditor starts getting the person for doing things that are legit, but are now in question because of other things found.  The burden of proof then falls on the taxpayer to prove their legitimacy.
Its possible to tax via the company, but that brings another level of complexity into it.  But failing that, the responsibility falls onto the person, and if there is a large enough amount involved, its worthwhile to pursue it.
As an example I use E-Trade and they send me statements quarterly and report "gains" (if I sell stock) to the IRS.  They also report dividends, which I have setup to automatically buy more shares, but if I took those as profits, those would be reportable as well.
E-Trade is like my bank, they report to the IRS on my behalf for things that are "reportable" like capital gains, interest earned on accounts, etc.  Could a exchange do this?  Sure, but if they don't, the taxpayer is responsible.
What happened here though is that there were transactions that are suspected to be money laundering, and since BTC-E can't identify who they are, they got hit.  But, depending on the law, its possible they would have been required to register as an exchange and properly collect data from their users as well because of this, plus also report transactions exceeding an amount.  This is likely what they got nailed for.
It will be up to the authorities to pursue the people who used them.  Will they?  Maybe so, or maybe not.  What they may do is move to seize all the funds and allow people to file claims against funds they claim to be theirs.  By doing so, of course, hopefully those people have properly documented that the funds are indeed theirs...and they have reported them properly if gains were made.  This is how they will catch people.  Many will probably not claim money unless they properly documented it, and are willing to pay the proper taxes on it.
That is how they will get people.
Governments will bother with such things if the amounts are enough.  The guy that made a few hundred bucks?  Nah.  The ones who made a few thousand?

So who owes their bookie 60BTC or they start losing limbs?
@_date: 2013-04-07 19:36:29
Well, I'd call whats happening there pretty groundbreaking, honestly.
But thats why you don't put your eggs all in one basket.
Which is why I have a little bit in the stock market, a smidge in Bitcoin, and a good amount in the bank.  But not one bank either.
The more baskets, hopefully the less risk that something happens to one.
But the whole banking thing going on there, I'd call it pretty much a power grab, in a way.
Could it happen here?  Sure.  But in a way it already does.  My personal favorite is how California is in the hole budget wise every year, so they estimate how much they need for next year, but the figures they use are pretty old.
That and the "Oh, we'll collect more taxes off paychecks in the first 6 months than the last 6 months and it will even out" trick they pulled a few budgets ago.
Although not nearly as much money as a 10% across the board grab, it could still affect someone who is relying on their paycheck being $300 not $290 or something like that.
I suppose you never know.  Especially with most of the money in banks nowadays being electron based, not physically in your wallet.
@_date: 2013-01-19 22:03:00
How much did you buy them for?
It could have easily gone in the other direction as well.  And it still could. With fluctuations like that, one in the other direction wouldn't be unusual to see either.
@_date: 2013-02-13 23:59:05
Sold ~100btc that I had bought at $9 when it hit $25.
Have a chunk of about 60 or so that I bought at $11.
I figure I'll let that fly at $29 or so, or at $25 if the fall begins.
I have about 250BTC at $14, going to hold that for purchases and similar for now.
I agree that $30 is going to be the interesting point when it gets there, thats why I think my next sell will be 29ish.  
Edit:  But since its falling today, I won't be selling either for now.  Maybe its good I got my $9 out at $25....  I'm going to keep the rest I guess for now.  See how far this drop goes.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:11:03
Good.  People here seem to think that places are going to make the full conversion to BTC.  Adding it as another option seems to be the better idea.
Just as long as you fully disclosed.  I see a lot of people trying to get places to take it submitting false information about it.  Its not fee free, though its a lot lower for sure.
Good job on adding another option :)

Your parents are just whiny.
I have plenty of money and my parents never ask for handouts.
Don't lump all parents together.  I help my parents out but its by my own choosing, and it often took me doing a bit of arm twisting for them to allow me to do so, and I help them on things like adding their XM radio to my account, etc.  Nothing major.
You think its bad now?  If you give them anything....it will be 100 times as bad.  Resist.  Or be prepared to start paying them an allowance.  Which it sounds like they will promptly blow and not use for anything they are saying they will.

I don't know if I'd want to do futures trading with the instability.
Sure there is potential for gain, but also for loss.
I don't know if a business would want to get into this with that going on right now.  It would work great if the climb keeps going as it is, but a sudden stop would be pretty bad.
It would be risky either way, but I think you'd be better off in the regular trading market in this situation.  And I wouldn't be committing more than a few percent with the sudden dips you can see.  The variance when it was $50/per was about $8, now you're seeing swings above $10.  That would be major for a business if they had a lot into it.
@_date: 2013-04-16 05:44:29
I think its the realization that a lot of the things people hyped when it was rapid climbing as reasons (Cyprus, etc) was simply not true.  It was speculation, pure and simple.
The balloon burst, and now its just slowly falling.  I'm thinking what you're seeing is the usual business done daily before all of that-Miners selling a smidge here, a smidge there, and the market is so jumpy right now that any little trend becomes a big trend.
Paranoia is a lot higher now than it was before the fall, honestly.
Oh, and I'm buying back in if it hits $50.  It will be with profits I made, house money, so if I lose it, I lose it.  But I've already decided that.
The speculators are long gone.  Get it back up to $100 and they will be back though.
@_date: 2013-02-17 18:16:55

I do understand it very well.  I understand that if I want to sell it I either have to go through online services that will take a percentage and possibly lose my money or make excuses to not give me same, or I have to go through private parties who might be scammers formerly from Criaiglist.
You can't obtain them from anyone without some risk existing, or without using some service that could screw you.
Perhaps you have had good luck with it, as I have, but its obvious that some people are not having good experiences with it.
Unless the only way you're getting Bitcoins is through freebee sites, you're going to have to interact with some service or some person to obtain them, and the reality is, they can screw you over.
And since Bitcoin has no reversals on transactions and no ability to recover coins if someone scams you, its a perfect vehicle for people to do so, stupidity or just plain being ripped off being the reason.
It may very well make or break the currency if someone with some major holdings somehow gets the shaft.
Thats probably why every schmoe on the internet shouldn't be messing with anything like it if they don't understand risk, or how websites work on the internet in general.
The first part of my post was sarcasm, by the way.
@_date: 2013-01-19 23:05:36
Did you sell a large amount?  Unless you had a bunch, you probably wouldn't have made a mint more.
Its the kind of thing people who do trading like that for a living face every day.  Do I sell now or wait?
It LOOKS LIKE it may keep going up, but you never know.  Gotta flip that mental coin.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:09:01
I'm guessing that the rise to that "market cap" will be much slower now.
Any increase in the price suddenly, at least for now, will be hopefully seen as speculation and everyone will let them do it, and perhaps make a little profit on it.
But I don't see the rises we have been seeing going on, and people buying in at the peak of them.
It will take a bit longer to get there, for sure.
I also think the pressure on sites that spam the blockchain like SD going up.  A slight increase in the transaction fee, and/or simply not accepting such very low fees or no fees transactions sitting there for a long time will make room for more "legit" transactions as well.
I believe also that Bitcoin should be and will be marketed as another option for a lot of places that decide to take it.  It will be another option, not the only option.  So although more places may adopt it as an option, its not going to suddenly overnight be the only option for a bunch of places.  So the increase in transactions, etc, will be a slow rise, and can and will be handled as it happens.
Its not going to be a massive change overnight tomorrow, and its not going to be a full conversion like people around here here scream for.  It will be another option, not the only option.  
They should be thinking about it, but I don't think its going to happen as quick as everyone keeps predicting for these reasons.

If you have more than 250k in deposits, having them all in one bank isn't very smart anyway.
I have about 4 times that in various things and its spread way out for that very reason.
There is a reason why they tell people who win the lottery or similar to get a good financial planner first.  Sure there are FDIC limits, but you have to be smart enough to know how they work and deposit your money/invest it in FDIC insured accounts properly as to not exceed the limits.
The small company I partially own does the same.  Sure we have an account at the local bank, but we have other accounts as well. 
You don't leave all your eggs in one basket for sure.  That just invites trouble of all kinds.

Seeing that in investments, stock, bank accounts, CD's, etc I have close to a million now, you can do the math and tell what percentage I have in BTC.
I don't see him doing it in the near future either.
I won't include the 4 rental properties I own or the house and halfplex I have either.
Maybe when it gets more mainstream, folks.  And I don't mean getting Dropbox to take it because they got 30k people to click yes to something, then not use BTC for it at all.
People who speculate speculate where they know.  Some of them have done it with BTC.

I'm not saying that is what happened here, by the way-But I'm not going to donate and ask for BTC in return.  I don't need to.  I don't want any credit for it.
I hope that others have the same attitude and donate because they want to help people, not because dropping a $20 meant $35 back via 1BTC.

Because you get a margin of the profit it generates, and as peoples shares are satisfied via mining, your share can increase.
Depending on the type of rental.  There are some places that let you "lease hashing power" for say 1btc, and once your share hits 1.25btc (from mined profits) you get paid and its done.  So, basically, the person buying the mining rig pays 25% interest on the loan and pays it back via mining, and its an open ended loan, first to loan money or buy in gets paid back first.  But when its said and done, who owns the rig and gets all the money generated once the shareholders are paid off?
The person who bought it in the first place :)

I have bought it in very small chunks simply because it keeps increasing in value.
I don't have much, I think the last time I looked I might have something like 350BTC or so.  I have made a few purchases with it.
I probably won't go above 500 or so, and I do track what I'm buying it at in USD, so if it starts going down , I know what the average price is that I paid for it and I'll dump it before it gets that close.
Its a very small portion of my portfolio.  Assuming that what I have is worth about 5 grand, I have 20 times that in the stock market, roughly.
I won't sell though unless it just suddenly takes a really big downward turn.  I haven't bought lately, so most of my coin is in the $10-11 range.
But what I have bought is just small transactions here and there.  Just like the money I have in stock, if I was to lose it tomorrow it wouldn't hurt me.  I have a lot more tied into safe, FDIC insured investments.  Of course, those don't even beat inflation.  But I figure I'd rather have the bulk of my retirement funds in something insured.
Stock and Bitcoin is what I can stand to lose, in other words, and not just be totally ticked off about it.
If a few of the vendors I deal with now personally switched to it though, I might increase my stock of them a bit.  Perhaps double it, and use BTC to pay for stuff instead of USD.

I have to tell you also that your comment made me think of a plot in a Austin Powers Movie:

We will then suddenly unleash our ASICs on the Bitcoin Blockchain, put in a massive sell order, collect our money in multiple currencies, and then forget to include the transaction in the next block, allowing us to keep the Bitcoin as well!"
Number Two: (Clears throat)
Dr Evil glares at Number Two.
Number Two:  "Austin Powers posted about the 51% exploit on Reddit yesterday.  The post has well over 1000 points and 100 replies already."
Dr Evil:  "Shit."

Probably won't happen in the near term, simply because there would be questions of it prohibiting those who cannot afford a computer the ability to vote (the poor) or people who cannot or will not deal with a computer (the older generation).
I honestly think we'll need another generation or so before this idea takes hold.  Right now there are enough people who do not use or do not trust computers enough for this to be viable.  Perhaps as an option, but I don't see it happening as a full conversion.
However, since it seems like people can file taxes electronically without interception or issues for a good part of the community, its possible.  But until its easy enough that anyone can do it, it won't gain traction.
Especially if it can be DDOS'D into slowness or oblivion like some Bitcoin trading platforms have been.

You can do this with credit cards already, for a small fee of course-which is why, with all the "screw banks" talk, in the end if it does get adapted, they will wind up making money on it as well.

I can understand telling them they no longer want to do business, cutting them a check for the amount they have, telling them they have 30 days to switch, etc, but it sounds awfully fishy.
I don't like BofA and a lot of their practices and got my parents to quit them a few years ago when I and my accountant pointed out some things about them, but this sounds a bit far fetched.

Would it be immoral if when I bought in at $50 you sold your holdings you bought at $20?
There is no morality to trading at all.  If you think thats the case, then you seriously need to rethink.
The bottom line is this:  NOBODY had a gun held to their head to buy at $240 or at any other level.  They did it of their own free will.
Had they succeeded in making millions, they would have done it on the backs of others.  But since they didn't, now its immoral?
Nobody forced anyone to buy in.  They may have put on a cheerleader outfit and danced around to get people to do it, but the decision to do so was of their own making.
It happens on the Stock Market every day.
Bottom line:  They all had the balls to buy in when they thought they would make a mint, knowing they would lose it all.  They lost.  If they were foolish enough to invest money they COULD NOT AFFORD TO LOSE, then that is their issue.
Me, and many others on the subreddit, preached this for WEEKS.  ONLY INVEST WHAT YOU CAN AFFORD TO LOSE.
Morality has nothing to do with it.  Buy low, sell high.  Thats the way it works.  If you can't handle it, then you don't buy in.  Period, the end.
Immorality, my ass.  You buy into an unregulated currency, you know EXACTLY what you're getting into.  If you don't, you should stick to FDIC insured accounts.
Which, by the way, is what I do with 80% of my investments.  The amount I had in Bitcoin doesn't even break a percentage point.  It was the amount I was willing to lose.  But I gained, because once I reached the point I was starting to get nervous, I got out.
But don't call it immoral.  People were buying in right to the point it tipped over yesterday.  They did it because they thought it would keep rising.  They placed their bets on the table.  And they lost.  Or won.  
Nobody forced them to.

I took at $48 simply because I couldn't see not doing so.   The original amount I had was at $10.  210BTC.  You can't pass that kind of profit up-there isn't a stock in any of my portfolios that had that kind of increase.  It wasn't my intention to do so, in fact I had bought those to buy a computer off a BTC-accepting website, but then I found a better deal, so I just kept them.
It reaches the point that you have to take the money, its too enticing to sit.  I don't buy and sell like a day trader though, for sure.
But even a $10 drop in a stock unless its something like Google would cause an eyebrow to raise, which is why I was shocked nobody had said a thing about it.
And now its at 61.30, so it appears the drop continues, though I guess this is the normal weekend drop?  $13 doesn't sound normal to me, but hey, what do I know.  
I'm a conservative investor for sure, but I couldn't pass up that kind of profit.  And at least at the moment, people who bought at $74 have to have a raised eyebrow, I'd think.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:13:30
It would, I agree.
I'm just saying if the corrections are 20%ish, the higher you get, the more people may start thinking "Crap, I just lost $50/btc" or higher as the amounts get higher.
People scream to hold, but the more money that gets involved with a 20% drop, the more likely people are going to gut-check and maybe sell, which could trigger a larger drop.
Trust me, if it drops 50% I'd be back in for a few grand at least.  I'd have to take the chance, and you know the speculators will be jumping in with BOTH feet at that point.

They let you, but not all of them are linked to each other.  However, you can universally do that via BTC, provided you buy them all on the one that takes BofA.  They will all take and give BTC.  So if you do your initial buy on the one that takes BofA and get your coins, you can then move them to a wallet.  Where they go from that wallet can be anything that takes BTC-which is what they all do.

I suppose in this fashion you remove that social aspect, though I have to admit I like them much better like that in person.
But to each his own, I suppose.  Phone sex operators still make mints as well, as well as porn sites online, though with the advent of sites such as Tube8 and similar, it can be had for free, although at lower quality.
I suppose the fact the person is doing the things just for you makes it unique, but I would think that would vanish the moment you discover they are doing it for others as well.
But thats just me :)

Exactly.  I mean I know SD supposedly "pollutes" but seriously, Bitcoin has a few adopters, but none that anyone would call "Very Serious."  How would someone like Amazon impact the blockchain?
Bigger adopters aren't going to do it if its already hitting the limit because of a single gambling site..... and I doubt SD would have a tenth of the impact Amazon would on Cyber Monday, much less a normal business day.....

Check your local news or nationwide news.  There was just a massive ripoff with "prepaid" cards as well.
I wouldn't be surprised if stricter limits are put on them in the near future because of it.
That, and the amount of regulation Visa/MC would require.  They just don't let anyone start issuing cards without a massive agreement, and with Bitcoin being unregulated, they may not allow for it.  The "bank" issuing them would likely have to do the conversions and Visa/MC would have nothing to do with the Bitcoin side of things.

If it wasn't for the long line, I'd say Gox, but you'll need to verify for that amount.
I did two 100 BTC buys through them at $50 when it was at that price.  No issues.  Did a few lesser ones before that (buys/sells) without hassle also.
But I've been verified for a while now.  There is a line now, ~9000 people if the reports are correct.
They are fine unless there is some kind of massive rush on the market, then they get backlogged, but honestly I think they all did when that fork happened.

There are a few sites now that are adjusting daily or more, it looks like now.
But a few weeks ago a lot of them didn't, which means you were kind of guessing where they had got their last figure.
One common theme though is I see a lot more of them now posting "1BTC=$x" for the local currency-but that doesn't mean the prices are based on that, of course, they could just have a script that queries whatever exchange when you open the page.

Exactly.  Its not just people who fill their houses with stuff and stuff and stuff and barely have anywhere to walk.
Someone with $1000 in their mattress could be called a hoarder, especially by someone who wants to buy something and knows about the money but the person won't give it to them.
Its a pretty broad term.

This right here, and it usually has to be in local funds, and in some cases, has to be an account on its own, only used to hold deposits.  IE, he can't keep it in his own account, or the main account if he has one for the rental only.
If the BTC were to lose value, your friend would be required to make up the difference.  The deposit amount has to be stipulated in the lease and maintained.  Until the lease is terminated, it is assumed the lessor will get back the deposit in its entirety upon termination of the contract, less any damages at proper and allowed values.  Depending on the jurisdiction, some things cannot be billed for normal wear and tear (such as paint and carpet that are 5 years old are considered done, and cannot be billed to the lessor, etc), and in a lot of cases, if you find damage, the lessor can fix it on their own at their cost if they don't like your figures.  Depends on your jurisdiction.
In most cases though, the deposit must be held in the funds provided at the time of lease, which means in this case you have to keep them in USD or whatever local currency.  I'd consult someone in the know before messing with it.
Source:  I have 3 rental properties, managed by property managers, deposit funds are kept in an account for deposits only.  I have property management because the laws are a pain in the ass, I let them handle that.

EDIT:  Nevermind.  You said BTC not USD.

This is for illegal sales.  Obviously people on the up and up would go through a dealer as required, like I would have to in California.
People doing things under the table have no regards for the rules in any fashion anyway.  Using Bitcoin doesn't matter in this case.  They will use whatever currency the person selling wants if they want it bad enough.
Bitcoin or no, its still going to happen.  The only thing Bitcoin may do is allow someone to make a buy without the risk of someone stealing a bunch of cash from them, but if they have a paper wallet on them, someone could still steal that from them anyway.  No difference, really.  The only difference is that if they can get back to their computer first, they could move the coins before the thief did.  
@_date: 2013-03-04 23:40:15
I think its more for the overall benefit of Mega than this, though you could be right.  But talking up Bitcoin attracts those who have it to use it on his service, and also may inform people who don't know about his service as well.
Its good, yes, but I think a lot of it is talk more than action.  I'd have to believe it when I see it.  Kim has brought some interesting things to the internet, but he also has a lot of ideas that at this point are just ideas.

I suppose.  But in the end, a credit card from Bitcoin Bank is about the same as a credit card from BofA, especially if the fees are the same.
You're still paying money to use money.  And since I don't see someone starting up a Bitcoin processor to put on the cards like Visa or MC, it kind of defeats the idea.
I'm honestly surprised people want cards like this.  I could see having merchants accepting BTC, but a credit card leaves a massive paper trail, which at least to the people seeking the ability to be anonymous seems like a large no-no.

Spreading out will help them in the long run.  The more trading platforms, the more targets for DDOS, the less downtime.
Will it affect the bottom line?  Sure, but they should be able to handle it if they lose say, a third of what they have now.
But looking at the queue....doesn't look like it.  But then again, we've lost a few other exchanges last week.  The one in Germany looks promising though.  Some good solid competition would be nice.
@_date: 2013-05-05 14:48:17
Yeah it is, when you make it so easy for someone to take their money, and don't have a chargeback system to allow them to get it back.
Its a weakness that is too easily exploited for the average user in this day and age, and should have been considered.
Just because you are "smart" enough to secure your machine, as am I, you have to consider the average end user nowadays if you want to make something like Bitcoin be accepted by the masses.
By not doing so, you have basically "locked out" or discouraged a large segment of the world community that would consider adopting it.
Everyone clamoring for worldwide acceptance on this board needs to realize that you shouldn't be telling all your friends about it unless you're willing to educate them on security for it as well.
It is not a basic, easily used currency if people can easily steal coins from the average computer user.
@_date: 2013-02-14 20:53:06
You'd hope you had something on hold with a lawyer somewhere that, if something like this happened, would then release the information to the appropriate people (the partners).
Goes to show that no matter how good your friends or business associates may be, it only takes one person holding the keys to run off with stuff.
I own part of a small business myself and I have been questioned before as to why our checks require 2 signatures and there are 3 authorized signers-me, my boss (the majority owner) and our accountant. 
This is a example why, if in fact "Erick" ran off with everything.  Sure, my boss and our accountant could conspire to clean stuff out, or I and the accountant also, but the odds are a lot less.
Leaving one person holding the keys to everything can result in that one person saying thank you as they run off with everything.
A lesson to be learned here, for sure.  And its happened with a few bitcoin based businesses as well.  Although bitcoin has nothing to do with the losses, it does show why other forms of currency use safeguards on many transactions.
In this case the wallets probably should have been split and depending on the number of people involved in the company, each had access to one and the money coming in and out went to whatever the number of wallets equally, and outgoing as well (ie, 3 people running the company, 3 wallets, every in and out transaction uses those 3 wallets with equal amounts coming out of each to make the total sum of the transaction, then if one person runs, you're out 500btc out of 1500 instead of all of it like happened here).  Or you ratio the wallets according to the part of the business owned, if me and my boss used btc, I'd own 30% he'd own 70%, you setup 2 wallets and provision them as such.
Greed is a powerful thing in humans.  Another demonstration of it here, if the "facts" are as stated.  Even if he was the majority shareholder, the users as well as the other partners are out their percentages as well.

And be sure you get rid of those credit cards.
Go cash only.
If you're worried about credit score and you have no other debts, ie a car payment, then keep one, buy something small on it once a month and pay it off to keep your score going.  Or keep it for when you need to make hotel reservations.  But use it in the sense that the moment you make a charge, you go home and make a payment for that same amount.
But get rid of them now-don't put yourself back into the hole.  Use credit for things with collateral like vehicles and real estate.  And once you have either of those, if you don't need the card for hotels and similar, just use your debit card and get rid of it also.
You and your credit score will be glad you did.  Unsecured credit is for the birds.  You're more ahead than many people now if you have no unsecured debt.
But get rid of them-having them around feeds temptation to use one if you see something you want.  Change your attitude-take the money you were making in payments and commit it to a savings account.  Once the account hits a few grand, take a bit and put it into a CD.  Then let it grow back up, take 2 grand and put it into a money market account.
And go from there.  If you can.  You say you're unemployed, but do your best not to re-incur the debt back to the level you did.  Its better to pay cash than some bank 10% to spend money.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:22:33
Freezing trades is market manipulation.  You basically are prohibiting people from buying or selling, and if a selling frenzy is on and the price is dropping, you are causing those people to lose money, and if it continues to fall, possibly everything.
Although Bitcoin is unregulated, such a thing would result in MtGox getting their asses sued off because they caused people to lose more than they would have from the lag.
People should use other exchanges instead.  You can't just freeze trading like that.

Since Bitcoin is the way it is and doesn't have a Central Bank, having PR for it would be about the same as having PR for "Anonymous".
Anyone could step up and be an expert, and whoever the media believes first would become it.

If anything they'd buy in and out of it and profit from it, making themselves more rich and powerful.
They'd use it to their advantage.  They wouldn't be quaking in their boots about it.
My point being that everyone who comes on here that thinks that Bitcoin is going to cause banks to fail and fiat money to be a thing of the past....needs to pass what they are smoking.
It may become another currency in its own right, but its not going to do any of that, thus the fat bankers and the people with money in them will be just fine and dandy.
Its simply not going to happen.  If anything, it will be another investment vehicle for people to get richer.
And when it comes down to it, the government will bail out banks, and their own currencies.  But not Bitcoin.

Plus with the floods, they can drive the price just a bit lower before they buy, or just a bit higher before they sell.
$1 or $2 doesn't seem like much, but it is when you're talking blocks of a few hundred BTC.  That will cover the Gox transaction fee plus net you a bit more BTC, or a bit more $ if you're selling.
Not paranoia at all.  If you watch the charts it happens a few times a day.

Why not.  
Used to happen on IRC all the time.  People would take code of Services (Chanserv, Nickserv, etc) and just change a few things and call it their own, even though it wasn't allowed to be copied like the Bitcoin client is.
It stopped when the guy released a version of it with a snippet of code that basically registered his nickname when it was first ran, silently, and he would log onto their network, id, and get godmode access to services.  Then he could just ban everyone in services and effectively ban everyone from the network.  They would have to restart all their servers to remove the ban and figure out why services did that.  Everyone would get booted off the network but him.
It stopped the copying pretty quick.
The bottom line is people don't care if its allowed or not, if they think they can get away with it.  In this case its allowed, so NBD.  
But people steal code all the time from copyrighted or non-open source programs all the time.  They don't give a shit, to be frank.
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:45:49
This, exactly.  I said this in a thread a few weeks ago and got berated for it too.
It is to their advantage NOT to fix the problem.  They make money, win or lose.  Its all just another trade to them.  They take their cut every time.
And this isn't odd behavior.  It happens every day.  Look for a nice rise or a fall and you'll see a bunch like this.  People playing around, seeing if they can move the price up or down.  Then suddenly a nice large buy or sell, along with a bunch of others, as others take advantage of the rise and fall as well.
Been going on before the crash before, even.  And one of those along with user DDOS (everyone going into panic mode) was the crash, basically.  You don't have to DOS when the price falls $30 or so.  The user panic does that for you at that point.
They may not make much on these "crud" transactions, but that isn't where the money is.  The money is where the manipulation is made, and then a buy made low, or a profit taken high, or simply a few hundred more trades made.
Gox gets a percentage of it all.

It means only those with high hashing power will have a chance in the mining game.  You'll either have to upgrade or get left behind.
The difficulty will increase quickly as the solves are slightly easier at first with the new hashing power, but eventually it will be at a level that makes it as hard as it is now.
But unless you have a ASIC, it will basically be impossible to be in the game anymore.  People will have to invest to make profits.  It will probably become a bit more centralized, and I have a feeling once it takes hold, people doing it on their own will be rare.  Pools will take over, and there will hopefully be more of them with the whole 51% thing in the back of everyones minds now.
Until they come out though, nothing will change.  Once it does though, the adjustment in difficulty will keep everyone on an even field.  But the ticket for admission in the game will be ASIC or nothing.
Provided we ever see them, of course.
One benefit of this happening will be as the block size has to get bigger, the difficulty, etc will adjust nicely as well as that is added in-and with the higher hash power, it shouldn't affect the solving time, as if the block size increases, the difficulty will decrease slightly to keep it solving at a nice rate.  It should help with that a lot better if the need arises.

If he did.  Its good that he got his money out before then.
He probably had to before the bill came due.  Cash advances on credit cards usually carry large interest rates, but not if you pay them before the bill cycles through.
At least I thought thats how he did it-it wasn't a bank loan.
The fact he had to pay it back before they processed the bill might have saved him from a world of hurt.  Course, his backup plan could have been "The heck with it, if it goes bust, I will just file bankruptcy."  There are a lot of people with that attitude.  Probably the reason why they recently increased the timeframe between filings to 8 years and put more restrictions on it.

Not a bad idea to keep a paper backup of wallet keys in a secure place.  Then you could just load the keys into a new wallet if need be.

The problem is they aren't the only exchange, so although they may have halted, all the others continue the slide.
Once they do reopen, they will assume the value of the others-which is $80 right now.  So either way those people have lost.  They aren't getting the amount of money MtGox shows them having.  Once they reopen, they will be to the prices shown on other exchanges.
It works if MtGox is the only exchange.  They aren't.  All this will do is drive it down further.
And the difference between Forex and Bitcoin is simply-Bitcoin is not regulated, so it doesn't matter.  And being that they are not the only exchange, its a moot point now.
It would be different if MtGox held exclusive trade rights-they don't.  And after doing this and the price falling further, its likely they are going to hold less of a market share come reopening.
Anyone using them on their website as the barometer as to what their price is at the time of closing isn't using them anymore either, because they are not displaying the actual value of Bitcoin.
They are not the only exchange.  Trading continues and the slide continues.  Unless MtGox plans on paying everyone holding BTC on their exchange 123.40 (which is what I believe the price was when they halted) this is totally meaningless.  Those people have now lost the ability to sell at that price point before it continued the fall.
I guess it was a fun ride, but seeing as there is no regulation, the people that lost have lost, and they have no recourse now.
Their only saving grace will be a reopen and a climb to 123.40.  Which, if that happens, I see alot of people selling off Gox-or transferring their funds off the moment it does open.
MtGox's credibility is shot either way.  But stopping it wouldn't have helped in this case, and being unregulated, they had no reason to do so.

Thats cool.  You'll get going though.  Keep in mind I'm 32 years old.  I went to school, went through a few bad tech support jobs, met my boss who was starting a business, been doing that ten years.
Its fun, but the kind of return I got on my BTC sale I will never see out of any of my investments.  Ever.  My boss actually bought the same amount when I told him about it.
Will we go back in?  Maybe.  But it was purely to see what we could do, thats why we didn't do much.  :)
You can hope that what you has keeps increasing as well though....you're still in the game :)

Right now it is, and seeing as they aren't doing anything to stop it or limit it....that tells me they either simply don't care, or love the volume that happens once the DDOS goes away and is replaced by users pummeling the site with trades.
If the confidence was reduced and thus trading volume overall dropped, I think Gox would already be blocking the odd trades/stopping the manipulation somehow by setting limits.  They have done neither, which tells me either they are just clueless, or they like the money being made by the increased volume every "DDOS" causes.

Its that generation.  I have a grandmother who, still to this day in her care home, insists on having 2 weeks worth of canned goods under her bed just in case, and will only alllow her money in the bank to be invested in FDIC insured accounts like CD's and similar.
Although I do have a pretty good amount of my money in same to preserve it, I do have a bit in the stock market and other things as well.  Her only care is that her bank account every month gains X dollars from her social security check, and minus X dollars for the care home fee + her phone, etc.
Its a mindset a lot of our older generation has now.  Toss in the fact that when I brought a laptop once and showed her pictures that other relatives had taken, she was totally amazed.  The digital picture frame I got her for Christmas is always on.  Shes fascinated by it, but she is very set in her ways when it comes to money.
I should mention shes 100 years old, but still.
Even my parents have the same attitudes because they remember when you had what you had and that was it.  Or they learned about it in High School with a thick leavening of their parents tales of how it was when they experienced what they were learning about.  My Dad has stock-from the company he worked for, but he never bought anymore.  It split a few times so he has a few thousand shares, but thats his only investment in that realm.  He did get a 401k because it was available, but he set it to the fairly conservative side as well.
Those generations were raised with a few things in the back of their mind-Social Security insolvency is something thats only came up in say the past 20 years or so, and they are all assured its not going to jack them-its going to jack us, the younger generation, so they stick to it as well.  
They look for security, they look for insured.  Its just the way they are for the most part.
And in a way you really can't blame them.  Especially my Grandmother.  If she wants 2 weeks worth of soup under her bed, and it gives her the peace of mind to sleep at night because of what she remembers, I have no issue with it.  Its also her money in the bank, so although I may tell her things, its up to her.  She earned it, she saved it, she payed into the Social Security System, its up to her.  My main concern is that she could run out, but since that isn't a danger unless she gets into her 120's at this point, shes content, shes sharp as a tack, she likes the place shes living at, you get the idea.
For our generation Bitcoin is perfectly logical.  For her....shes fine doing what shes doing, and probably so are my parents.  The only way I could see them getting into it is if it really became interlaced.  Maybe it will, but probably not in the very near future, and even if it does, they are used to what they are doing.
It took me 3 years to convince my Dad a debit card was safe as long as he practiced good PIN security.  He would always go to the bank and draw cash for gas and stuff.  I finally had to sit him down with the disclosure and show him the liability was the first $50 if he reported the loss of the card timely, etc.
Its just the way that generation will look at it.  You can't fight personal experiences.

Correct again, however at least if Paypal does something bad to me, I can contact my credit card company or bank and seek recourse.
When a "bad service" using Bitcoin does something bad and I lose money, I can go on the internet and complain about it.  But that is the only recourse I have.
Saying "Oops, oh well, you should have moved your coins!" doesn't encourage businesses to use payment processors to accept Bitcoin.

You might want to slowly....slowly sell just a little bit and get your bills paid down while it is where it is.
Then if you're going to continue to hold, do so.
Especially if you have credit card debt.  Elimination of those now will really help your bottom line in major ways, and help your credit also.
The sooner you do it, the sooner your credit score will increase which can help you later if you decide to cash out and make any major purchases like a house-you'll get a better percentage rate.
And if you can afford it, cut the cards up after you pay them off.  Don't close the accounts, but stop using them if you can.  Keep one for drastic emergencies.  If they close off later from lack of use, thats fine, just keep the one active by using the card for small amounts and paying it off.
Just because you have a potential windfall....don't waste it.  Get your credit score better and you'll have more of it to use.

For those who know how to invest wisely they can easily ignore it.
But I don't blame people for continuing to say it when you hear about people taking out 35k cash advances on a credit card to buy Bitcoin.
People will do that if they think they can get rich quick, and its not only in America.
I don't know your financial standing (and I don't want to know) but people who have the wherewithal like I do and likely you do are smart enough to bet, but bet smartly, and to do so with money that if, we lose the bet, it may hurt, but it won't put us out on the street or anything like that.
There are plenty of people who roam these boards who are looking for a lottery win, and they will go for it.  
It gets annoying that you have to repeat it, but you have to lest someone like that read what you're saying and thinking windfall.
It doesn't help when you get others on here pumping up things that they don't even have a clue that they are talking about, as well.

If by cooling you mean its $30 below what people "think" they have on Gox right now, you're correct.
And once they reopen, if its not where the price is now, those people will lose or gain a major chunk within a few minutes as the price point moves to whatever the consensus is on the other exchanges.
Whats screwed is that the people on Gox are stuck right now.  They can't even sell and recoup some of their losses.

The best reason is they have potential to rise even more.  But honestly I think they are going to drop a bit first.  I'd wait a little bit.  Once you see it drop into the $12.50 range, go for it then.
I buy it as another alternative currency.  The demand is there-and I don't see it going away.  I don't have nearly as much in it as in conventional investments since I can't buy most things with it yet, but I think it will start becoming more mainstream, which is why I'm slowly buying into it.
People looking to make a killing on it probably won't do well, but I expect it will be a very stable currency.  A few more major providers online taking it and it will soar, and go up.
I figure that may take another year or so though.  Thats why I figure there will be a free fall to the mid 12's slowly over the next year, then it will start taking off as some places take it up.
I buy once a month, usually about 10btc or so.  I view it as a long term investment like all of the others.  If it went up massively I would sell, but I'm not in it for that reason.  I'm hoping that a lot of places start adopting it though, if they do, I will probably go to it for online purchases exclusively instead of using my only credit card and paying it off.
The next 2 years will tell the tale.  Maybe there will be a major taker this year.  I think maybe another year before that happens.  Once that does....it will take off.

Still not enough money in it for this.
Get it to around $500/btc though and you may see stuff like this start happening. 
We'll see if it gets that far though, because since trade is unregulated, it only takes someone with some fairly good holdings already to manipulate the market.  They are just sitting on their hands right now until it hits what they think is the peak.
They don't need the hashing power anyway.  That 1.3 million would be better spent slowly buying coins, slowly driving up the price.  That, along with everyone else doing so, would ensure a profit when they go the other way in a month or so, very slowly selling off.
Provided someone doesn't just drop a massive sell order before then, of course.  
The moment someone gets close to 51% control is the moment it will fall hard though, because now everyone is aware of it and keeping an eye on it.  Had nobody brought it up or figured it out...it may very well have happened.  But its all over the place now, so it would be harder to do, and probably people would bail out well before it happened.
It would have to almost be an instant turn on, and they would have to be poised to switch on and do what they were going to do, fast, because once people see that percentage, they will be getting out in droves.
But, in theory, since BTC isn't regulated, they or anyone else could do it, and there would be no regulations to prevent it.  So have an upvote for that fact.

Yeah but not if he does another thing hes talked about-creating a bitcoin based credit card.
Thats why I think his intentions are mixed.  He talks it up, but then talks about things that would make it more bank-like and put it under more scrutiny.
I dunno.  Just seems a bit mixed to me.  Conflicted.  Like hes saying the things he thinks people want to hear when they react to him.
His idea of encrypted email is interesting as an example to maintain privacy, but then he counteracts it with the credit card announcement today.  One would enhance privacy, one would allow you to use BTC.  Via Visa, it sounds like.  Conflicting, but almost like hes reading the responses to his "proposed" things to do to help-to keep himself in the spotlight.

The current system is more idiot proof than Bitcoin, but its not idiot proof.
If it was, everyone would be making money on it.
I would say it works for most people because they have money, they can access it, and in most cases if the bank does something stupid, their money is safe.
But its not idiot proof for sure.  Look at how much money banks make when someone overdraws an account.
More idiot proof, correct.  Totally idiot proof?  No way.  Its just the penalties for being an idiot are high enough that some people do learn from them.
Bitcoin is worse when it comes to this, but banking is not infallible.

Because if you have a sweepstakes you can't require entry based on the purchase of an item.  That is why they have to give you an option to enter without purchase.  If you have to buy in, its not a sweepstakes, its a lottery.
There are gambling laws in many states and in the US, and they vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.  I was just speaking of the in general reasons why BTC isn't going to make it any different.  Since BTC has value and can be exchanged to and from USD, Tax evasion is the likely angle to use, because its illegal to not report taxes to the IRS-anywhere in America.
When the major shutdowns of online sports books and the credit card companies had to stop allowing charges to places like that, the primary reason was the casinos ran offshore, could not be regulated, and taxes could not be collected properly on winnings.
Even Indian Casinos in California, though supposedly on land that is not state touchable pay taxes on earnings in order to get the right to run Casinos.  They also make other agreements as well, such as if they open a gas station to charge state taxes.  Technically if they really wanted to fight it, they are only subject to federal jurisdiction-which means they could just charge federal tax.  But since they get supplied by suppliers who are not on Indian land, they pay the state taxes also.
Casinos are a big cash cow for states and the US govt-its one of the main reasons Nevada doesn't have a state income tax, although they do have a state sales tax.
There are some countries, especially in Asia where you can gamble for things like stuffed animals, then you take the stuffed animal into the back room and exchange it for money.  Though technically legal, a lot of these places tend to pay off the local police or enforcement officials to get away with this.  Although I'm sure some of this happens in America, for the most part to run a casino here, you have the blessing of the state or the federal government, or both-or you are running an illegal casino and they will shut you down.  The blessing usually includes a fee or a tax or both, obviously.
It all comes down to Uncle Sam and the states not getting revenue the tax code says they are to get.

Depending on the payment processor and volume.  Some smaller companies will pay up to 5% (or more, but the most I saw was 5% when I looked into it) if they don't have a lot of payment volume.  The payment processor will discount the percentage in exchange for volume.
And with the new law that went into effect in the US, they (the merchant) can now "pass on" the fee to the person buying, which means if they want to, they can put a sign up that says if you pay with a credit card, you have to pay the fee on the transaction.  I haven't seen anyone doing it yet, but have noticed some places that didn't charge a fee for debit transactions are now doing so, mostly gas stations that used to not.  I don't think that was a part of the new law as ARCO has charged .45 for years, but it may have given more places the "guts" so to speak to start charging it.  Obviously the new law doesn't apply outside of the US so I'm assuming someone running a online business would have to not charge the fee to someone purchasing outside of the US, but they could charge it by default, I suppose.  One thing I HAVE seen was a gas station with a sign in the front door saying that they do NOT charge additional for credit cards-dunno maybe if a competitor is.  Then again gas stations in the US often have Cash and Credit prices, and the credit price is usually 5-10 cents more per gallon, and that has been going on for years.
But especially for smaller merchants, the percentage is pretty high because of the chargeback potential, and some of them will demand money be held in escrow as well in case of chargebacks-especially for new accounts.

Yes, but at this point, its still not hitting the "oh shit" point.
But as the price goes higher, that point approaches more.
I know there are a lot of people on here who say "look at percentages" and they are right.
But 33% of 240 is different than 33% of 200.  You reach a point where people, who know the amount they have in the game in USD or whatever, will see a 33% swing as "damn, I just lost $50/btc!" and they may panic.
33% looks worse and worse, money wise, as the price increases.  The odds of it triggering people go higher and higher the more the price goes up, is all I'm saying.  
Will it happen?  Maybe not.  But people get more itchy the more "fiat" is involved in it.  Especially if they just bought in to make money.  If enough people itch, 33% may become 40% or higher, which may draw more people in, which may result in the first "major correction" of Bitcoin.
People will buy back in, but at that point I think the rises we're seeing aren't going to be as rapid.
Unless, like I said, speculators already control a good portion.

I bought into it when they supposedly didn't, and suddenly they do.  Pretty good confidence killer.
I decided to switch to my own and not support them with my yearly subscription at that point.
Its something that people should be aware of though.  Especially Bitcoin users, since there is a part of them who use Bitcoin for its supposed anonymous ability.  
But also, some Bitcoin related websites (Blockchain) also allow you to use Dropbox to backup your wallets to.

You may also owe local sales taxes, depending on the location of the place you purchased from, etc etc.
NORMALLY of course these are charged at the time of purchase, but if they are not, and you should have paid them, they are also due.
In your example, sales tax should be collected.  In that case, that tax is satisfied.  The gain however, is not, and would have to be reported if it exceeds the threshold for that particular type gain in your taxing jurisdiction.

I don't see it being adopted widely.  Reddit taking it for gold purchases (using a payment processor!) isn't widely.  
And I'm betting if said payment processor suddenly loses 20 coins out of Reddits account and the only thing it can do is shrug, Reddit will probably shrug and stop taking payments via Bitcoin as well.
My point is that if this kind of stuff keeps happening, Bitcoin isn't going to get mainstream like everyone keeps lamenting.  And people are not going to buy into it majorly.
In fact I'd say that a lot of the increase in value right now is speculation.  Remove that, and the value drops.  Add in a couple of stories about payment processors doing shady things or having issues and it drops further.
Its why I don't have a lot of money in it.  It doesn't do me any good to buy more Bitcoin to pay for things if I buy it at $27 and its worth $20 tomorrow.  Its still pegged to the fiat dollar.
It won't ever stand on its own as a currency if security concerns unrelated to it itself, but tied to it because its one of the few ways you can acquire it, continue to have trust problems.

Its understandable why such sites have gone to it, but I can see it inviting more scrutiny into a currency that was meant to not be like that.

And what business wants to use a payment processor where they have to constantly move coins and monitor the payment processor so they don't lose money?
Thats the precise point of my original post.  I don't have to worry about my investments in banks.  I do have to worry about my stock portion, but even with that I can use an online service that, if a stock suddenly goes down, it will sell it automatically so my losses are curbed.
If a payment processor gets hacked or suddenly has a liquidity problem then I'm just out of the money.
And these kind of incidences happening is why Bitcoin may never be widely adopted as a payment method for businesses.  People who run businesses don't have time to log in every time someone makes a purchase and move the coins because there is a security risk.
They will take the money via a bank instead and take the time to run their business instead.  
And this is my point.  Everyone wants Bitcoin to be mainstream, but it appears more and more every day its not going to be for this very reason.
I put my money in a bank because I don't want to babysit it, and that is the exact point of my first post in this thread.  If things like this keep happening, how is it going to be widely accepted?
Yes, the payment processor is not Bitcoin.  But the average layman just sees "Bitcoin" and "Processor" and "Loss" and won't take the risk.
That is the problem here.  If these issues keep happening, Bitcoin will not gain businesses wanting to use it as a form of payment.  Its a processor problem, but Bitcoin will suffer the consequences through no fault of its own.

Someone got itchy.  You can't blame them.  The higher it goes, the more itchy you get.  No matter the amount of anti-itch cream you apply.
Especially those who have coins they bought at $50 or less.   And can you imagine the thoughts of people in at $25 or less?

I get payouts still from some of the sites like BitVisitor and similar because I have used them for a long time and have posted links onto some sites with a BTC address of mine as a referral link.
Though I don't get .25btc (its more like a few milli a day) if you signed up for something like this, or did it across a bunch of sites and got people to use your link, you could be getting it that way.
This is even though I haven't been to them in well over 6 months.  Supposedly if someone uses your link, they are your referral for life, or until they reset whatever database they use to determine that....

I wouldn't even call it that.  Profit taking, if anything.
Plus with the way Bitcoin is, any slight mention of a possible issue is going to send speculators selling.

It will probably be a hard sell on him simply because of when he lived.  If he was in the great depression era, the idea of it not being insured will probably make it a hard sell.

In the case of Bitcoin/Gox, Yes.  Its been demonstrated.  Gox's verification queue continues to grow and grow despite it happening.  I'd say its helping, and right now, is becoming more successful.
In cases of short term DDOS: Yes.  Sympathy for a targeted site, and the temporary publicity it gets by being reported helps more people discover the site, simply by the press such attacks garner.
Long term:  No, for obvious reasons.
But in this case and in this conversation, I would say that trading volume is up, the amount of users wanting to use Gox is up, so right now, it is making it more successful.
Normally my answer would be no, but in this case....its not cut and dried.
TL;DR: No.  But if Gox keeps it up, that theory is challenged.

Bitcoin.  No chargebacks, no refunds.
No, in this case its not Bitcoins fault, obviously, but still.  Dishonest people will take advantage of it, though.
Escrow services are going to make good money with it, thats the bottom line.
Its just sad that it appears a "semi-major" Bitcoin player appears to be involved and not wanting to make it right.  I'd expect this for a few BTC for some item that I'm buying from some guy off a website.
Plus, lets be frank.  Insurance limitations are well known and well stated.  Especially by FedEx, who is the carrier here.  I use them, Brown, and USPS daily at my small business.  Computer hardware, even though I'm dealing with MAJOR players in it, is always shipped insured.  The limits are well known and plainly stated.
Having said that, I dunno if I'd ship silver domestically much less internationally, because stuff like that is an easy target to be taken.  Probably why major players or brokers in that would have arranged to have a local supplier ship it via bonded courier or similar, most likely.  That kind of stuff is risky at best and I would have insured the heck out of it.  It makes me wonder if it was, or if it was insured but as something else.  Really shady sounding.
I don't see this going away till they make it right, though I agree that it should be made right at the price it was at when the transaction happened.  Demanding the BTC back at this point probably won't fly, he will get the money back in USD or the currency of his choice at the time of the transaction.  Demanding what BTC is worth now isn't going to work.  And that may, in the long run, scare merchants off.  I see a lot of AUP being modified today to reflect refunds will be issued "based on the current market rate of BTC at the time the transaction was placed on the blockchain" or similar as well.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:39:32

Look at what the writer also looked at.  With all the scams lately and people just spouting off about Bitcoin, as a beginner I'd probably also have the same opinion, honestly.
We've honestly reached a point where too many people are speaking up, and the facts are getting drowned in hyperbole as people are scrambling to get X site to take BTC even though they don't intend to buy a thing from them once they do.
Let Bitcoin promote itself, seriously.  All of these odd "spokespeople" can't even get their facts straight between each other.  Its easy to form an opinion like this when you look it up on the internet and see 50 differing opinions.

I have been doing it for 9.5 years.  Why stop now?
My boss has said though that he wants to retire around age 50.  If thats the case, about 12 more years and we'll seek some kind of endgame.
Its not that we haven't tried to bring another person in to help me.  Its just the two we have tried didn't work out, even though they said they had no problem being on call, they would ignore calls, which doesn't fly.
I should say that 80 is the extreme.  It doesn't happen every week.  Slow weeks are around 60-65ish. :)

Lets just say the angle of percentage for taxes angles up a bit around where I am.
My boss makes more and had the deal Congress made for taxes at the beginning of the year stuck as proposed originally, we both would have been paying an extra percentage for everything over 250K.
The line wasn't for millionaires.
I believe they settled on around 500k, but I could be mistaken.  All I know is my accountant said it wouldn't affect me this year.

@_date: 2013-04-16 04:59:50
You link the NFC to a account specifically made for it.
I do the same to my debit/credit card.  That account only has $200 in it unless I know I'm going to need more.
My main checking account has much more than that.
I go online, log in, move money from the main to the card one as I need it.
People will do the same thing.  They aren't going to go to the trouble of converting to BTC.  They just move the money from one account to the other.
I ever lose my debit card, I have the banks assurances as well as the fact its not good for much, unless I happen to lose it right after I moved an amount to it to use it.
And once I notice its gone, I can transfer funds back, leave $10 in that account till I get a new card and the old one is cancelled.
Maybe you can do that with Bitcoin later on when its more widely accepted, but there are real world solutions now.  
Especially with a credit union.  No fees, and the only requirement is that the account has $5 in it. 
Maybe in the future, but right now, BTC is too variable for people to do stuff like that.  I could have moved $100 to BTC 2 hours ago and it would only be $90 now.
Just saying.
@_date: 2013-02-17 19:58:12
Correct.  Except to the average layman internet user, they will see a loss, it happened using Bitcoin, and upon further investigation, they have no recourse.
And the reason they have no recourse is because the primary "selling point" of Bitcoin is that there are no chargebacks.
Even if the funds are found and returned, people are going to see the negative of it, and it will reflect on the currency as a whole.
Paypal processes millions of transactions daily also.  One person get screwed out of some money and it makes headlines on Reddit.
These kind of situations make the currency look bad although the currency has nothing to do with it.
It is probably why a lot of places have not adopted it yet, and may never do so. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:17:24
If you don't know basic computer security or anything about financial markets, I'd say it still applies totally.
Bitcoin is for more advanced computer users, and for users who have enough common sense they don't follow spam links.  That eliminates a good 75% of the internet population right there.  For those people, its a total scam and they shouldn't bother.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:54:29
If you don't know what to do, thats fine.  Worst case take the cashout and stick it in a CD or something until you can talk to someone.
Remember taxes as well, depending on the level of windfall.  Don't take advice from anyone who says you can just not report it.  If its over 10 grand, someone will notice, trust me.
Any person advising you to do things to skirt taxes is not a person you want to be dealing with.  Don't lose what you've made by not reporting it.  Be honest, take the hit, and you'll keep most of it.

I'm only technically in ~4k.
I bought and sold a few times, taking profit each time.
Initially started with 2k, doubled it, got back in on a drop, doubled it again to a little over 8k, then bought 10k at 50, so I added another 2k at that point.
If I sell at 50, I make 6 grand after what I've put in.
But looking right now its at 134.  What?
I'm just wondering how many are seriously itching hard right now.
@_date: 2013-05-04 20:50:23
Bitcoin has its own share of bullshit as well.  Until you polish it and make it perfect, its just as bad as a bank.
The glaring fact is that someone without basic common sense can get Bitcoin stolen easily.  They'd be better off at a bullshit bank.
This is just one of many examples.
Banks aren't the best (though I have to say the Credit Union I'm with does a lot better than your regular bank!) but having protections in place is a good thing.
Without some improvements in Bitcoin, its not something people can carry around with confidence at this point.  Its good for people who have some common sense and know computers fairly well, but for mom, pop, and especially grandma and grandpa, its not going to fly.
I would say that Bitcoin is a good start, but it needs improvements.  Just like banks.  It creates another option, but its not a stable enough option to be taken seriously as of yet by anyone except people with a bit of savvy and knowledge of computer security.

@_date: 2013-03-16 21:43:59
Could, but I wouldn't be holding my breath.
I'd worry about getting a percent of the world to take it and then go from there.
How much of the world takes the USD?
Some of the "screw banks" mentality around here is just funny.  The only people making money on USD to Bitcoin and back are the exchanges.  Until you have enough people taking it, businesses taking it will have to convert and either lose money or charge higher prices to make up for it, and so on.
Trading would still happen.  Its just the exchanges that would notice the difference-they'd have a whole country cut out of their exchanges, and thus they'd be losing the percentages off each exchange.
So yeah, you're screwing banks and Uncle Sam, I suppose, until the exchanges wind up being owned by the banks.  If Bitcoin gets going, you know they will get involved in that end of it.
They will make money on USD, BTC, and converting to and from each.  And every other currency in the world.
Banks make money on every currency exchange unless you're doing it on the street.  If enough businesses adopt Bitcoin, its another currency they will gladly exchange. 
In the end, you have another currency thats a bit stealthy, but if you don't think the banks and Uncle Sam won't get in on it....you're not seeing the big picture for sure.
It might affect the USD a bit, but I don't see it influencing it much.  It will just be another currency right beside the Euro, et al.  Just another way for someone to make a buck, or a bitcoin, or whatever someone is trading for what.  Just that its in pure electronic form which makes it even easier to make a buck.  Its nice to take 4% for moving some electrons through a wire :)
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:58:50
I don't think it was DDOS at all, and if it was....it was only for a short period of time till the selloff began.
People in a panic wanting to sell, and people waiting for the bottom to buy are much more of a site dragger than any DDOS could ever be.
You just get the drop started, everyone else does the rest.  
I don't even think they did, to be honest.  A few hundred small sell orders will drop the price enough to make people wonder, and once a few of them pull the trigger on sells, you have your lag.
Don't even need a botnet for that, just some good timing.

I'd buy again if it got to around $100 I think.  But that depends on if I see the fall coming and get out higher with what I have now.
Since I bought around 20, then around 34, then at 50 (and made a bit every time) I'd only probably buy with gained money at this point, I think.  
But who knows.  I told myself I'd be done when I sold at $34 and made about 8 grand.  Instead I put in another 2 grand and bought at $50. (along with the 8 grand I had made to that point).
Guess I'm a fool for it too, but not foolish enough to do it now.  I think I'd just be funding someone selling. :)

I don't see it as marketing his business.  I see it as marketing himself.
Every other day here you see something about him, talking about him coming up with something great for Bitcoin.
And everyone is buying into it.
I'll find it more believeable when I see it, is what I'm saying.  I see him marketing himself (and Mega) via "announcements" on things hes going to do with or involving Bitcoin.
The thing is, except for Mega taking Bitcoin....its all just talk, and people are falling over him like hes the person who is going to MAKE Bitcoin.
That is what I'm talking about, and then when his next latest thing he wants to help Bitcoin comes out, it would have the opposing effect.  One thing would increase privacy and being anonymous (the encrypted email).  Everyone loves it.   Now today is the big announcement that he wants to help get a credit card going.  Well, that would remove being anonymous.  
To me its like hes tossing things on the wall and seeing whats sticking, and in doing so, garners hits and responses here and in other places.
But everyone thinks hes a visionary for doing so.  I just don't see it.

In a way yes, in a way no.

I do when I can, but since there is still a lack of major stores taking it, my choices are pretty limited.
But I think right now a lot of buyers are taking advantage of the fact that they have BTC in lower dollar amounts and are getting things at a discount price, that is what is driving buying more than just using BTC instead.

&amp; add something that says when we see 80% utilization of the current blockchain size that a mandatory (within 7 day) adjustment in size happens both client side and internally.
If this means you release sub-versions of the official program (ie 0.8.11) to keep this going, then you do that.
You don't watch it in wonderment and then suddenly "oh, hmm.  Most people are still running legacy (0.7.x), now we have a problem, I wonder if maybe we should have migrated to .0.8.x."
I mean I know Bitcoin isn't a regulated currency per se, but before the fork happened there was talk about the blockchain size and that it was going to become an issue.  But all it was, was talk, till suddenly this issue hit.  And it happened before as well, so its not like nobody knew what would happen.
Like I've said in a few posts, this was the mulligan for Bitcoin.  It happens again, people will have questions.  Two times means that its now a known and should be monitored with some kind of plan to prevent kind of issue now.  No more excuses.

I think part of where the interesting thing will lay is where people who have chunks are at right now, buy price wise.
I have a smidge over 200BTC that I bought at 14.  Right now I'm holding, but I think if I see a correction to 25 I may be quite apt to bail.  If it gets to 35 and holds for a few days I may very well wait till 30.
But I don't have a lot in the game.  I'm sure there are people who have more than I do at a lower price, and as it inches up, their "nervous" points are heading up as well.
There have been some steady gains followed by sudden $4 corrections, I think these are the nervous ones selling at the instant they think its starting to cave.
The only interesting thing about it is that if it starts to cave and some bigger players get nervous, the volume may trigger selling suddenly that makes $4 look like nothing.
I could very well go to sleep tonight and by morning the $14 btc I have could be worth less, depending on how much of a panic ensues.
I think now we're starting to root out some major holders, which will make a selloff into a huge moving thing.
But hey I'm just guessing like everyone else!
