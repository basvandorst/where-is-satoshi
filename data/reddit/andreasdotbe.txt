Well I think I'm gonna try the Norwegian 'justcoin' for a small amount. And continue to hope that my deposit on bitstamp will get true eventually.

Bitcoin is pretty hard to get in to at first, being something totally new and abstract. And with the increasing popularity the amount of newbies is only gonna get higher. 
But from my own experience most users of this reddit are newbie-friendly, I think is doing great.

I've an Brother MFC too, but after some googling it turned out it doesn't use a HD, it uses only flash memory which deletes the data after printing.

Yes, my bookmark for reddit is stil but nowadays I always directly go to this subreddit. 
Mostly because I'm looking for a good moment to buy (missed crash this week due to bitstamp's problems..)

Damn this is nice. Being able to read quality articles about bitcoin is really nice. I directly signed up for the next edition. Good job!

Thought 'Gazet Van Antwerpen' and 'Het Belang Van Limburg' worked pretty much to getter? To bad this article wasn't in GvA.
I also saw this video earlier on ['De Redactie']( about bitcoins. Nice to see that bitcoins are getting more attention in Belgium.
