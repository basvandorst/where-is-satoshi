Congrats! My wire goes to the mortgage company today and I will be joining you.  
  
No ragrets!

Since ALS killed Hal Finney, how about The ALS Association?

Gdax. It took a while to get out since I was limited to 10K per day, but I was pretty satisfied with them.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:13:14
A bit. As of today I would have had an extra $100K!  It is like they say though, hindsight is 20/20.  At the end of the day though, my house is paid for and I had a 30X return on my investment.

There are ways to get verified for higher levels. I just don't know what they are.

Coinbase:

I was HODLing for 4 years, before it was even called that. How long have you been hodling? I am going to be back soon, but debt free.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:00:22
It is actually $37,950

I totally agree with him. I took all the risk yet they profit. Whoever said life was fair?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:12:23
I was not too worried as the passphrase is still needed with the seed.

That would be your AGI which is after your personal deduction. I have a hobby job lined up that will pay me in cash under the table. It also helps that I am in a very rural area.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:16:22
A pussy that is debt free. I can handle that.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:33:00
I would only need it to do a recovery. If I need to do that I would peel off the plastisol so I can read the seed. If someone did happen to access the safe or be around when I had it open they would not be able to see it.

When I had this problem it was because my PC did not have a web cam and they wanted a selfie of me. For some reason the error message was empty.  I used a laptop instead and it worked fine. Their phone support is helpful with verification issues too if you need it.

I actually sold on GDAX, but when moving the money to your bank it goes through Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:17:20
I will need to figure out the cost basis for buying the coins and the difference between that and what I sold them for will be taxable as long term capital gains. In my bracket I will have to pay 15% of the total gain. I am not sure yet if I need to pay estimated tax in this quarter or I can just write a check when I pay my taxes in April. I am waiting to hear back from someone on that.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:18:48
1) I do use a passphrase. That is why I was not worried.  
  
2) With a Trezor you actually enter your seed words on the device and not a computer.

Crypto is here to stay.   
I do think there are a lot of shady things going on in the space. The more value Bitcoin has, the more people will try and control it.  
That said, I will be back.

They are just doing what the IRS forces them to do.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:28:19
You pay $9 in interest for every dollar you get back. This saves me 6K in interest the first year alone, not to mention the freedom of being debt free.

Something similar to this: 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:11:16
I needed to sell all of it to have enough to pay off the house. I will buy back in soon with money I would have had to pay my house payment.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:54:24
I am looking to retire soon and having the house paid for first was my prerequisite. I do not escrow my insurance and taxes so they get paid out of pocket.
  
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:01:35
Yea, this is the most important takeaway.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:15:41
The faster the house is paid the faster I can start buying back in. I also only wanted to have to figure my capital gains once. I am not really looking forward to that part.

Coinbase has a recurring transaction feature.
  
  
  
I just set it up to buy a certain amount of bitcoin every week using my linked bank account. You just set it and forget it.
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:47:48
At the time I moved it, Coinbase was not going to support BCH. I still have it and will hold it for at least a year so it is a long term gain.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:34:41
I probably did not phrase that correctly. I know if I pay them I will not have them ruin my life over it in the future.
