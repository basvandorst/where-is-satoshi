Well, it depends, if the client purchases the hardware firewall (100 eur) then yes, he'll be, DDoS protected upto a certain limit though, others wise, after 2.5 Gbit, the server is cut off from the network (null route)
drop me a email at support if you need a solution and we can work it out :)

For the OpenVZ VPSes, it's 100 Mbit/sec unmetered fair-use, ie, you cant use 100% all the time, but you are able to burst upto 100 Mbit/sec at anytime, for the dedicateds its 2 TB for servers in Germany, I can provide a cheap upgrade to 5 TB bandwidth if needed and unmetered 100 Mbit/sec in US.
Feel free to email me at support  :)
