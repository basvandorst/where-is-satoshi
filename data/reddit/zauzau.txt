Enjoy paying your short term capital gains tax..

I love my Shift card. Use it every day!
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:18:50
Cool. Thank you. Had no idea this existed.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:10:05
Eg. I make a $500 deposit, and the app then disperses my deposit into custom target allocations I've set up.
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:16:56
Hmm. Ok. I would definitely use it. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:39:26
So you didn't finish the verification process, and you're complaining about your low limits? I'm confused.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:03:22
Mycelium is a great one
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:43:40
I just did this! I donated to the Peninsula Open Space Trust (Bay Area enironmental nonprofit). I paid in dollars, but I also included a suggestion that they start accepting a bitcoin payment option.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:39:33
Mycelium is a good one.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:25:57
I use a credit union, and my account limits are pretty high. Way higher than I need. Not trying to sway you, just informing you of a different experience. Could be because of your bank..
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:49:01
You're young. Start investing the right way. Your goal is to build a diversified portfolio, not a Yolo one. I love bitcoin, but I'd never put **all** of my money into it.
You're interested in getting in now, because it's at an all time high. Careful, that's all. Best of luck to you!

Everyone tweet him, and explain that his analogy to tulips is so irrelevant it's funny.
@_date: 2017-08-09 14:35:03
This is actually quite huge. Fidelity is one of the most respected big US investment brokerages. This definitely helps to legitimize bitcoin and cryptos. Awesome!!
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:51:13
Bitcoin should be a part of your portfolio, not all of it. Investment diversification..
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:49:52
Just make sure to do the backup when you create your wallet. Write down the list of random words it generates for you, and put that paper somewhere safe.

I really enjoyed this docuseries! [
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:48:22
Pics or it didn't happen
@_date: 2017-08-13 15:11:42
Putting all of your money into one investment is not a wise thing to do.
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:24:34
I'm ok with coinbase improving. This is pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-08-13 16:45:16


Op prefaced his post with this. Obviously this thread isn't relevant to you, so why bother posting here at all?
@_date: 2018-06-03 01:18:08
Interesting. Here's their official website: [
@_date: 2017-08-26 21:01:22
Thank you for bringing this up. How does bitcoin gain widespread adoption as a currency if 90%+ are locked up in accounts already. There are a finite number of coins, so can someone explain how this works? 
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:53:39
Get yourself a Ledger Nano S on Amazon. They're like $80 bucks. Never worry again.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:58:00
I think this might actually happen
@_date: 2018-06-07 20:29:32
Yes, I want this. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:27:02
Coinbase just launched a Crypto Etf for accredited investors. They also have/are aquiring lots of crypto startups. You're way off.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:01:20
I've heard there are some scams on there to watch out for. It's reputable, but do your research first.
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:42:28
Do you know how big that family is? There are many, many different branches. Also, wealth doesn't trickle down through generations very well. We're talking about one person here.
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:47:04
I just used an app called Shapeshift to do this. Whole process took about 20 minutes.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:43:39
Multiple wallets
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:05:54
Put that list somewhere very safe.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:59:38
It's 10 bucks dude. If you think it's worth posting here asking for investment advice over that amount of money, you probably can't afford to lose it anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-04 15:02:50
V and MA are good investments regardless of bitcoins current/future performance. Both pay dividends as well.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:01:01
I've never had any issues with Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:25:15
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:24:12
You can do it! You'll feel better both physically and financially.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:27:19
you have 200 million usd in btc? Ok.. I doubt it.
edit: this is you?? You have the 18th largest btc wallet of all time. I call BS
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:32:58
Bank issue, not Coinbase. Ditch Wells Fargo. Use a credit union instead!
@_date: 2017-10-02 23:55:31
Would Mycelium be ok?
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:36:17
No. Just hold. No tax implications until you sell.
@_date: 2017-10-08 01:42:56
How do you figure that?
@_date: 2018-07-22 01:25:25
Great. I'll definitely check it out!
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:16:28
Investment diversification is really important, man. I believe in bitcoin, but I would never put all of my money into it. Put a few thousand in if you wish, put a few thousand in a robo advisor like Wealthfront or Sigfig, and explore other strategies too. Just some friendly advice.
@_date: 2017-05-28 02:18:04
Robo advisors are an investment strategy for people who want to build wealth, but don't want to actively manage their portfolios. Most of these services have extremely low fees, and your money will be actively reinvested and re-balanced (free of charge) as your portfolio value grows.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:21:13
You got it. Successful investors minimize risk. It's extremely risky to bet it all on bitcoin. You may make lots of money, or you may lose lots. Don't expose yourself to such uncertainty. You can grow that 30k into a million if you play it smart!
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:55:35
Great question! I am wondering how many coins have been lost or are irrevocable. Anyone know how to estimate this?
@_date: 2017-05-22 04:29:24
It's just getting started.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:56:37

At this point in the game, not profitable. Don't get sucked in to false promises of high returns.
@_date: 2017-07-09 22:19:25
From the front page of their website under the 'philosophy' section:
"Your deposit is for life and irretrievable."
You should have read the front page. They even told you what would happen if you gave them your bitcoin(s).
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:39:17
Why? It's FDIC insured on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:14:48
I swear to God, I'm not trying to but my experience with Fidelity over many years has been quite excellent. Sorry to hear yours wasn't very nice.
@_date: 2017-06-03 02:48:35
Read your title again. You are mistaken.
