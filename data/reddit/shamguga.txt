I'm happy to see some consolidation above $10K.

Who wrote them on paper? Were they already on paper when you received your device?

How was the seed generated and who wrote it on the paper? I haven't seen you answer that anywhere.

Awesome art. What's the original?

Your question isn't very clear. What do you mean by "chain" as opposed to a block? A 'chain' can just be defined by the block at its tip, so you would announce a 'chain' by simply announcing the block at its tip. Peers will fetch it if it's above their current block height and meets the minimum PoW possible at that height. They will then perform validation to ensure it meets the consensus rules. They will accept that chain as valid even if it re-orgs their current chain (ie. the new chain forks from an earlier block than their current tip).
I'm not sure what you mean by 'fake' either. As in it doesn't meet the PoW? Or it meets the PoW but has invalid transactions? Or it's a valid re-org?

Nice. What's new?

You should sum up the USD value of all payments from the mining contract by using the BTC price on the day of each payment. The capital appreciation from the Bitcoin price was not given to you by the mining contract; that came from holding the BTC after it was paid.

Your analogy would be more accurate if the shelf was practically infinite in size, and each book had a 1/30 chance of having $10 inside it.  So actually you and your friends can start searching in different places, and have an equal chance of finding $10.  So you just split up the space, eg. take a column each, and there is still a practically infinite amount of books for you to both check, so you will never run out of search space or have to co-ordinate with eachother during the search.

It managed to escape Earth orbit at the end though!

Zuck could be the one driving up the price!

Then the block will be rejected by your peers (due to insufficient PoW) before they even need to request the full block from you. PoW can be validated from the 80 byte block header. The hashes cannot be "seemingly-correct" if they lack the PoW.
Btw you can't offer blocks to the network as a whole; only to your peers. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer protocol. If your peers accept your block as a valid and highest block, they will offer it to their other peers etc and it will propagate through the network like that.
Peers will also ban you if you're offering bad block headers too many times.

By that same math, his $23.55 is only worth $22.60 in buying power.

Same with interest. Interest payments count as income and are taxed, even though some component of the interest is just to cover the inflation.
@_date: 2019-06-01 14:27:44
Yeah, and even then you won't break even because of the blockchain fees for opening/closing channels.  But I do it anyway for fun and to learn about the network and help to bootstrap it.

Confirm those trannies!
@_date: 2019-04-28 22:52:41
Yes, technically speaking there is no field in a transaction that specifies the "satoshi per byte" value. There is just an absolute fee amount, which is the difference between the total satoshis input and the total satoshis output. If output is less than input, this is treated as the mining fee. This could be any amount in whole satoshis. From that fee, you can further derive the "satoshis per byte" by dividing by the transaction size in bytes.
So for example, a 300 byte transaction with a 1 satoshi fee would have 1/300 = 0.00333 recurring sat/byte. Getting such a transaction relayed / confirmed is more an issue about the policies that each node/miner chooses to run. As far as the consensus layer is concerned, it's perfectly valid.

How can you transact less than a satoshi on lightning network? Since lightning channel states are backed by real Bitcoin transactions, how could they encode a value less than 1 satoshi?

Tesla and Bitcoin.  Two of my favourite things :D

I'm a bitcoin bull, but the 1 million new users per month thing sounds wayyy optimistic.  That would be incredible if true.  The Xapo post gives no sources for that number.  Is he just counting utxo set growth or what?
@_date: 2019-04-28 02:43:20
True, but channel fees can be amortized over the life of the channel, so the per-transaction fee would become small if you use LN a lot.

Isn't a fractal supposed to repeat at different scales? This just looks like a repeating pattern.

BTC is more like a currency or commodity. It's not priced like an equity like AAPL or AMZN. Companies are valed by their discounted future earnings, which is limited by their revenues and margins
Money is valued only by how much value people want to keep in it. If people want to store trillions of wealth in BTC, it'll be worth trillions.

Unspent transaction outputs
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:25:57
The bitcoin core software only needs to iterate through the chain once to build the set of unspent outputs. Verifying a new transaction just requires a set lookup to find if the output is unspent and retrieve the script for verifying the signature.

Which website? I thought bitcoinwisdom was broken.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:45:07
Oh yeah that sounds like Satoshi. A big proponent of common law and not at all interested in digital evidence. Such a cipherpunk right there.
@_date: 2019-05-10 00:04:54
Barely.  Once those kind of laws are actually getting passed, then we're definitely in that territory.

I wouldn't want to be holding BCH right now.

I need the price to go down so I can buy some more. So I'm going to google "what is the US dollar".
