It was a transfer of wealth from the late buyers to the early arrivers.  
Bitcoins are digital beanie babies

People are realizing Bitcoin value is whatever people assign it and since its been declining, more sellers are selling.  A panic is beginning.  This is what crashes any type of market, from stocks to tulip bulbs.    Look up "the greater fool" concept to understand why HODL isn't working anymore

You're right.  A great concept of crypto has been wiped out

If you're really preparing assets for a collapse, you should look to get tangible and tradable goods
Get guns, ammo, alcohol, dry food foods, freeze dried foods, and other tradable assets.  That will be the currency in a post-collapse world 
Nobody is going to want your gold, silver, bitcoins, beanie babies, or bottle caps when survival is at stake

The demise of Bitcoin happened because it went from a currency to an investment.  The future looks bleak, especially since other crypto now have better features.   Bitcoin stands now solely as an investment and it's a dying one.  The HODL thinking is soon turning to despair.

It's almost like Bitcoin is some kind of scam

There are still a lot in denial.  Talking about all the uses for Bitcoin as a currency. 
Reality is Bitcoin went from a currency concept to an investment pyramid scheme.  The late arrivers are giving their money to the early arrivers.  It's over.  The sooner people accept this the better chance they can stop losing money
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:22:21
It's kind of big news

Wasn't Bitcoin first?

I recall Hugo stating he could smell ashes and cinder when Bush was speaking to the UN.  I guess Hugo should have focused more on his own job before dying

This is good for young people to learn how bubbles work 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:59:44
You are so wrong.  The percentage is all that matters. 
Even your t-shirt example shows a 10x difference matters.  Investors just buy more shares or coins at a lower price and a 10x drop is a killer

.....aaaaand it's gone

6 months ago it was at $8700.  This strategy didn't work out to well then.  Why do you think next 6 months will be different?

Bitcoin mania is over.  The concept of getting super rich has played out.  It's time to cut losses and get the hell out. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:51:24
When has it ever lost 80% and then reached a new high?  Never 
@_date: 2018-11-24 15:55:01
Apparently the Bitcoin fans who are denying Bitcoin is in a bubble simply because they believe it will recover.  As if the two are mutually exclusive

Wish I had bought UGAZ yesterday.  60% gain overnight.  250% gain in past 2 weeks
Natural gas is so hot right now

You seem to think that bubble means something never recovers.  As if after the housing bubble, housing never recovered or after the many stock bubbles, stocks ever recovered
Bitcoin is in a bubble.  It lost 80% of value.  Of course, that is a bubble

If this were true, should we be seeing large changes in the prices of silver and gold?
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:18:46
The main use of Bitcoin is to discuss all the many uses that are rarely actually done.  In reality,  bitcoins are bought to simply hold and try to pump and resell to the next sucker   The Ponzi scam is coming to an end.  $1000 will come but this is a slow sinking Titanic

If the US give ban cryto to stop "drug deals and child porn purchase" and make it illegal to buy, sell, or possess crypto, that would make the demand drop hard and also make it hard to even determine a currency price.
