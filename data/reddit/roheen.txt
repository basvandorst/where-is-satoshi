They don't measure the things that you buy.  They measure a "basket of goods" which they change from time to time to distort the rate so that it appears lower than it really is.  Because when things get too expensive, people substitute cheaper lower-quality goods -- ground beef for steak, recovered beef "pink slime" for ground beef, rotting garbage for recovered beef slime, and so on.
Don't worry, rotting garbage is perfectly safe for you to eat once they treat it with ammonia, use other chemicals to react with the ammonia so it's safe to eat, and then you cook it thoroughly.

I don't know what the accounting rules are here, so I don't even know what suggestions to make.  I think we're currently using Deloitte for auditing.  I'll ask them tomorrow about it (they're visiting all week to shuffle papers), but I doubt that I'll get very far.
One positive surprise in this, though -- our internal accounting department actualy knew what I was talking about, and the reaction to my suggestion was neutral, not "zomfg drug dealers use it!!!" or anything like that.  They are not techies or geeks, so I'll take it as a sign that the knowledge of bitcoin as a payment system is at least spreading.

1) They have to make their money back somehow.  $5000 to $25,000 purchase price for most of them so far.  We are only recently seeing $1000-level ATMs being announced, and they are still vaporware.  Once these get into the wild, fees should drop, perhaps to a fixed transaction fee.  If nothing else, market competition should reduce fees -- there was exactly one bitcoin ATM in this country of ~25,000,000 people until two weeks ago.  Their fee went from about 10% to about 6% (hard to say because they don't announce the markup, and they don't mention which exchange they get their price feed from).
2) As others have pointed out, it depends on the ATM.  Lamassu has none of that.  But it is, or at least was, a buy-only system.


The markup reduction here came after a new exchange opened and cut a deal with one of the largest kiosk operators in the country.  The only downside to the kiosks is that they require your mobile phone number for a text message, but the fee is 1% plus seventy-five cents.

A Severe Strain on Credulity
As a method of sending a missile to the higher, and even highest, part of the earth's atmospheric envelope, Professor Goddard's multiple-charge rocket is a practicable, and therefore promising device. Such a rocket, too, might carry self-recording instruments, to be released at the limit of its flight, and conceivable parachutes would bring them safely to the ground. It is not obvious, however, that the instruments would return to the point of departure; indeed, it is obvious that they would not, for parachutes drift exactly as balloons do. And the rocket, or what was left of it after the last explosion, would have to be aimed with amazing skill, and in dead calm, to fall on the spot where it started.
But that is a slight inconvenience, at least from the scientific standpoint, though it might be serious enough from that of the always innocent bystander a few hundred or thousand yards away from the firing line. It is when one considers the multiple- charge rocket as a traveler to the moon that one begins to doubt and looks again, to see if the dispatch announcing the professor's purposes and hopes says that he is working under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. It does say so, and therefore the impulse to do more than doubt the practicability of such a device for such a purpose must be -- well, controlled. Still, to be filled with uneasy wonder and express it will be safe enough, for after the rocket quits our air and and really starts on its longer journey, its flight would be neither accelerated nor maintained by the explosion of the charges it then might have left. To claim that it would be is to deny a fundamental law of dynamics, and only Dr. Einstein and his chosen dozen, so few and fit, are licensed to do that.
His Plan Is Not Original
That Professor Goddard, with his "chair" in Clark College and the countenancing of the Smithsonian Institution, does not know the relation of action to reaction, and of the need to have something better than a vacuum against which to react -- to say that would be absurd. Of course he only seems to lack the knowledge ladled out daily in high schools.
But there are such things as intentional mistakes or oversights, and, as it happens, Jules Verne, who also knew a thing or two in assorted sciences -- and had, besides, a surprising amount of prophetic power -- deliberately seems to make the same mistake that Professor Goddard seems to make. For the Frenchman, having got his travelers to or toward the moon into the desperate fix riding a tiny satellite of the satellite, saved them from circling it forever by means of an explosion, rocket fashion, where an explosion would not have had in the slightest degree the effect of releasing them from their dreadful slavery. That was one of Verne's few scientific slips, or else it was a deliberate step aside from scientific accuracy, pardonable enough of him in a romancer, but its like is not so easily explained when made by a savant who isn't writing a novel of adventure.
All the same, if Professor Goddard's rocket attains a sufficient speed before it passes out of our atmosphere--which is a thinkable possibility -- and if its aiming takes into account all of the many deflective forces that will affect its flight, it may reach the moon. That the rocket could carry enough explosive to make on impact a flash large and bright enough to be seen from earth by the biggest of our telescope -- that will be believed when it is done.

It's not really that dumb of an assumption.  I can exchange USD in Thailand without any trouble.  Or euros.  Or yen.  Or any other currency I've tried.
I didn't try to exchange Malaysian ringgit, but probably could have even though it's a tightly controlled currency.

Whoever wrote that article is an idiot.  China economic growth is dropping fast.  The upcoming market turmoil is more likely to depress the price of bitcoin than drive people to it, because hedge funds will have to liquidate their positions to cover margin calls on bad bets.  (Like it not, the majority of the world is long on equities, not short.)
This is what happened in 2008 -- huge slide in the stock market, and a couple of days later suddenly the price of gold would drop, because hedgies had to dump it to cover their other losses.  The volatility eventually drove gold up, but not during the crisis itself.
Oh, and whoever wrote it doesn't seem to understand English all that well either:

You are supposed to be able to block overdrafts from occurring at all -- just deny the charge.
It doesn't always work.  Those fuckers at TCF Bank (motto: The Customer's Fucked) deliberately allowed a fraudulent transaction against my account.  The fraudulent transaction was from one of their partners for "credit watch services" or some such bullshit -- they gave the fraudsters my account information, I didn't.  That started a chain reaction of fees.  This was despite my refusing authorization for overdrafts and despite my refusing authorization for electronic transactions when I signed up for the account.  They shouldn't have allowed the transaction through for either one of the two reasons, but of course then they couldn't have ripped me off for all the fees.

The difference is that there is no meaningful way to stop people from engaging in bitcoin transactions.  With Uber, the app is centralized;  one company and one company only controls the entire "ecosystem".
Also note that, at least according to early articles on the Uber shutdown, the company didn't bother doing any of the things that it was supposed to do by law or claimed to do in its advertising -- register as a company, operate from a known location, do serious background checks on drivers, or anything else.
However, in part, they got screwed by the "oh, it's just rape, let him go" political/police culture in India, because apparently the driver was not ever convicted of a crime (the courts allowed the driver to reach a settlement with his previous known victim and thus avoid prosecution), and so Uber would have had no way of knowing or finding out that he was a rapist.

H. Beatty Chadwick (b. 1936) is the American record holder for the longest time being held in civil contempt of court.[1] In 1995, a judge ruled that Chadwick hid millions of U.S. dollars in overseas bank accounts so that he would not have to pay the sums to his ex-wife during their divorce.[2] He was incarcerated until such time as he could present $2.5 million to the Delaware County Court. Chadwick maintains that the money was lost in a business transaction and therefore he cannot surrender money he does not possess.
On July 10, 2009, Chadwick was ordered released from prison by Delaware County Judge Joseph Cronin, who determined his continued incarceration had lost its coercive effect and would not result in him surrendering the money.[3]
Although never charged with a crime, H. Beatty Chadwick spent fourteen years of his life in jail.

The exchange's website looked like it had an English option (javascripted).  I couldn't get it to work, but it was pretty easy to figure out the Chinese anyway.  Except for one thing -- to finish, it asks for a 1% "donation", and I've never been quite sure if that's the transaction fee or if it is asking for an additional 1% for something else.
A vlogger made a video of how to do the transaction at FM:
It doesn't seem to show the part about the additional fee, though.  I don't know if that was a change (only a couple of weeks after the video came out) or what.
@_date: 2014-10-18 21:46:03
Most likely it will drop, because a lot of the price runup was "investors" jumping in in case it doubled again.  They would need to liquidate to cover their other losses.  In other words, it would behave more like a commodity.
If it were to behave more like a currency, it probably wouldn't move much.  The "bitcoin economy" (to the extent there is one) is distributed worldwide, so damage in one specific national economy won't translate into weakness in bitcoin, whereas it would weaken that nation's currency.

I worked with a lot of "lol this is so easy any tard can pick it up I haz a music degree and music is same as coding they both use brains" types.  Some of the train wrecks they caused were truly epic.  On one project, I managed to reduce memory usage by 98% (this was in the days when memory usage mattered) by doing what they should have designed the system to do in the first place, and it only took about three weeks.  I had the three weeks to do it in because one of the untrained monkeys managed to idle the entire project for a month by screwing up the database and not backing it up.

In the years that I owned my house, property taxes doubled.  That was when the dollar was strong and fairly stable -- 1996-2003.  But the local voters never met a stupid project that they didn't love (libraries! schools! stadiums! light rail! a monorail! community policing!), and when they didn't vote for the latest stupid government tax increase to pay for all that crap, the state legislature would turn around and punish the voters by adopting something even worse (oh, voters don't want to add 0.1% to the sales tax?  they must think that's too small to pay off the bonds in a timely manner, so we legislators shall make it a 0.5% increase).
If you think that you will be allowed to keep your house when starving children need your wealth confiscated to feed them, when people are being foreclosed upon and need government shelter programs (and you can be turned into one of them!!! double win!!!), when the highways need fixing and politicians need paying and baseball teams need new stadiums and by golly the town needs a monorail, well, go ahead and put your money down!

OTOH, last night I bought some for 1% plus an 80 cent (not pecent, cent) receipt fee.  A new local exchange just paired up with the largest convenience store chain here to offer it over their kiosks -- two locations within a half mile of my apartment, two locations within a half mile of my workplace.
Previously, the only place was an ice cream shop that has a Lamassu, where the owner is charging around 6%.  I'm not sure, but I think it dropped from around 10% before the new exchange opened up -- it's hard to tell exactly what the percentage is, because the BTC-per-USD fluctuates so rapidly, and the ATM's pricing doesn't update instantly, nor does it say which exchange its prices are based upon.
As options expand, fees will go down.  Basic competition.
Now, if there were a way to spend it locally. . . .  As far as I am aware, the only two places that take bitcoin are the ice cream shop and the co-owned restaurant next to it.

Overall I disagree.  tl;dr: it solves no problems whatsoever and creates lots of new ones.  There is no benefit.
1. Use of a blockchain-like chain of title would not allow fraudulent transactions to be reversed without some sort of newly defined consensus mechanism.  That consensus mechanism would, in the end, either look a lot like our current court system or would be an unresolvable anarchy -- your domain gets stolen, ha-ha you should have protected yourself better.  (That's what we see here now when someone's computer gets infected by bitcoin-stealing malware.)
2. Almost as bad -- you lose/forget the private key for your domain, ha-ha you are locked out of it permanently.  A blockchain system would thus create a completely new problem for domain registrants.  Or do we create a consensus mechanism that allows people to fix that?  If so, then how do we guard against fraud?  (And see  for why fraud isn't fixed.)
3. Domains are currently leased, not sold.  You buy a domain for a fixed term, and get first shot at renewing that lease every time it ends.  I don't happen to like it, but that's how the system evolved back when it was decided to charge for registrations.  (Anyone else remember when they were all free?)  So a mechanism would have to be created to revert the domain to being unregistered when the registration expires.  (Probably easy, and it would be better than the existing ridiculousness about private auctions by registrars followed by the "drop list" and open registration.  This could also trivially be done in the existing system, however, just by Verisign dictating a new policy to its registrars.)
4. Even if some sort of consensus mechanism could be developed, akin to the concept of a shared public ledger, there are genuine issues of law that govern domain name ownership.  I disagree with many of the trademark issues that have forced their way into domain agreements (UDRP), but in the case I mentioned, it was a matter of contract, and the other party breached the contract.  The consensus mechanism would therefore have to be set up to abide by court decisions, at the very least.
5. A blockchain based system doesn't actually add anything useful.  Unlike Bitcoin, domain names are fairly static in terms of ownership and transfers are straightforward.
6. The existing power structure is not going to give up control, and even if it did, the new power structure would not be any better.  One of the actual positives of American control is that they are not petty, spiteful, malicious, and constantly butthurt.  Imagine China getting 51% of the hashing power on such a system.  Do you think they would act benignly?  I don't, and their record with the Great Firewall and other censorship, demanding user information of Google accounts to go after dissidents, and cyberespionage against foreign financial and defense firms all say the same.  Putin's Russia?  Yes, and all those investigative journalists shot themselves and committed suicide by polonium to make the FSB look bad.
I could go on, but why bother?

That is only true for people who want to use it as a store of value.
For those wanting to transmit money internationally, such as overseas workers sending money home to their families, or small businesses looking to make payments, the price on a day to day basis is irrelevant, since they will convert on one end, transmit, and convert on the other end.
This doesn't help those who want to move all their money into Bitcoin for speculation or to keep it safe from inflation, financial collapses, and government confiscations (see, for example, Venezuela, MF Global in the U.S., and Argentina, among of course many more such examples).

This is interest, actually.  In the U.S., if you are criminally indicted, they can hold you in contempt of court for refusing to divulge a password that would decrypt your hard drive so that they can examine your data.
A bitcoin address doesn't have any data to examine, however.  They can't use the value itself as any sort of evidence;  it's just a number.  Your ability to provide a private key for that number might be seen as evidence that you are tied to it (e.g., if the bitcoins at an address were known to be from a criminal act, such as someone transferring the bitcoins to that address after a hack, or as payment for a murder that actually occurred).  But then that might be seen as an inference that you were actually the hacker or murderer, so it would be testimonial in nature, which should be (but might not be, given a lot of the truly shitty precedents surrounding passwords) protected by the Fifth Amendment.
It would be interesting to see how that would play out . . . for a certain interpretation of "interesting", anyway.  Better you than me, Gunga Din.

In the last month, it's become available at 2900 convenience stores in Taiwan.  It's rapidly becoming usable for the nannies and eldercare workers here sending remittances back home to the Philippines, who instead of paying 20% in fees to the money transmitters can now pay 3% in fees, which is quite a lot for them.
Price got way ahead of adoption during the $1200 bubble, in part because of the giant fraud at MtGox and the fucking "Willy" bot.
Price seems to be stabilizing now.  It doesn't have to go up or down, it just needs to exist to be useful.  Being stable would be a plus, rising would be a major plus, but even if it's dropping it can be used to send money across borders without the destructive fees associated with the existing systems.

My guess is that Nakamoto has cashed out sufficient BTC, from mining done after his initial blocks, to live quite happily.  The early blocks are most likely going to pay for his family for the next ten generations.

So, don't worry about it.
Frankly, I find it sad that so many people run around screaming in panic about this issue, and/or whining about how unfair it all is that they can't be the primary beneficiaries.  Nakamoto did humanity a favor.  If he gets rich off it, so much the better for him, he deserves it.

Essentially nothing he has written in his first few paragraphs is correct.
I am just finishing up a lawsuit over domain name ownership.  Domain names are treated as personal property.  Domain names have a central repository at the registry that controls the TLD extension under which the domain name is issued.  For example, .com domains are "located", for legal purposes, in Virginia, where Verisign runs the .com registry.
Issues with domain name theft by third parties, and "slamming" between registrars so that they can leech fees, are readily solvable through corporate policies at Verisign that would then be enforced on registries doing business through Verisign, and through the regular legal process.  Examples are authentication of ownership, delay of any transfer that looks suspicious (such as for domains that are currently not parked), and terminating contracts for registrars that try to hijack domains from other registrars.  They do some of this already, but not enough.
Yes, the legal process for returning ownership after a case of fraud is complicated and costly.  That is an issue with any sort of legal problem in the real world, because governments and courts and lawyers have no motivation to make things cost less.

I doubt anyone's going to hang around a coffee shop to annoy bitcoin purchasers, and if anyone did, the shop could give them a trespass warning.  Oh, and buying from some random stranger strikes me as a lot LESS anonymous (and much more likely to be defrauded or mugged) than walking up to a machine and holding a QR code up to the camera.  (Robocoin is the only one with hand geometry nonsense, AFAIK -- neither Lamassu nor Skyhook bother with that crap.)
Any other source is probably not going to be as convenient as an ATM.
I can somewhat agree with your point on hackers, but physical security and limits on the amount of BTC "in" the machine at any time should help.  The one locally gets only 3/4 of a BTC loaded into it each day.  That level of loss in the unlikely event of a hack is absorbable.

Whether by theft or fraud, MtGox is dead.  Anyone who entrusted their money, property, or other assets to the company is already screwed, and not by any government.  The only two questions for government are (1) whether they can make a fraud case against Karpeles or any of the other people in charge, and (2) whether any assets can be recovered for distribution to creditors, customers, and other affected parties.
This is the government taking care of the second.  I hope they take a hard look at the first.  Karpeles' "what, me?  I am just a poor dumb victim of all this too!" attitude is infuriating, but it's not the Japanese government's fault.

Gee, I wonder how practically every other country in the world manages not to run out of toilet paper, with the evil USA exporting its terrible inflation.
Maybe by not having confiscatory "Bolivarian Socialist" governments that fuck up everything in sight.

Nonsense.  Greece still has both.  You seem to misunderstand the difference between an economic crisis and a massive natural disaster.


Yeah, because the people in Venezuela are totally better off holding their bolivars.  They can't buy toilet paper, and the bolivars don't make good toilet paper themselves. . . .

Wow, that's some scam.  I dug around for a few minutes, and couldn't find anything beyond vague high-minded goals about how they plan to fund research into "rejuvenation technologies".

Nonsense.  Plenty of trade goes on in other currencies.
Companies use USD for setting prices because it is relatively stable and is convenient for international trade, but nobody prevents or prohibits trade in other currencies.
Venezuela is collapsing because Chavez confiscated private companies' assets and handed them to his cronies, who have no idea how to run oil wells or supermarkets.
Argentina is falling apart because the government refused to pay its debts.
Cuba has been a basket case forever because its government is run by complete assholes.
Brazil has a horribly inefficient and stagnant economy because of high tariffs and truly insane labor policies that only goons and union thugs love.
Mexico is a trainwreck because the politicians, police, and military are all corrupt as fuck and go around killing people who try to organize to protect themselves against the drug cartels.
Quit confiscating assets from the productive and prohibiting people from working, and the economies would revive again.  But the politicians can't stand that idea because they love being able to fleece the poor in the name of "equality".
If the U.S. disappeared tomorrow, the main thing that would happen is that Brazil and Mexico would sink even further, because all of the people sending money back would no longer be able to do so.  The drug gangs would have to go on a diet, but they'd probably just switch to Mad Max style looting.
