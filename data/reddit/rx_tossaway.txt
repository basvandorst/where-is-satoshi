I read an article somewhere that said the NSA stuff an analysis of his postings and determined that he was one of four people (or a combination thereof).  The writer wouldn't say who told him, but also said that people could choose to believe him or not, he didn't care.  And he wasn't trying to push an agenda or point or anything.  Or something like that.

Are they listed as an authorized reseller on ledger's site?  They should be.  
The programming your own words was advice given to that eBay guy in his thread (as best I recall). To never use the seeds (words) that come preset in, that you can (and should) make your own.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:25:56
The other advice is good. I'll add on the plus side not to forget, you can buy small amounts.  Ie- $50 of Bitcoin (.0035, for example. (I don't know the exact amount, that's just an example.))  So small amounts, if you're willing to risk losing it completely, can be purchased.  Also, there's a lot of hassle, wait, and fees.  Fees might make it but worth while, getting verified on an exchange takes time, learning how to hold and keep your coins takes time, and if there's any problem with a purchase on an exchange, that can take a LOT of time to resolve.  And it can be volatile, not great for the nerves.  (But good for learning patience). So know that going in.  But, for all that, you'll learn a pretty interesting thing that's going on in the world right now, and if you do have more income later to invest, you'll be wiser and your learning curve already past.  Now might not bea bad time. Prices are lowish, and there's less crazy volatility (so far).
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:20:26
Yeah.... You guys know that there are other market sites that do the same thing, right?
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:41:03
Yes, that sounds worrisome.  There's a way to program your own words into the nano (I believe, I don't own one).  Definitely use that method   98% of how many reviews?  I've seen a handful of scammers pop up on Amazon, resale sellers. They're offering a great price for something, but have almost zero reviews and fresh accounts.  For something this important I wouldn't bother with used, refurbished or resellers of any kind.
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:19:48
Aha.  Thanks -
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:31:03
Yeah... No offense, but if a year here didn't get you any learning, then more of the same won't either.  Seek other sources.

No prob.  And this is (roughly) what I was talking about.  It's discussed in various comments throughout the thread-

if they're cash settled, then the volume is in cash? off an exchange?  then what is the volume of?  dollars? on what (fiat) exchange? cme? that doesn't sound like it would affect btc much at all.... since btc actual price comes from the (current, crypto, exchanges)
tldr- where is this volume occurring?
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:25:55
yes, but *your* name would still show up.  that's how I read the comment.  you're coinbase (because you are sending the money) in this case. if I'm understanding the situation correctly
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:55:08
So that leads credence to the argument that the actual effect on btc might not be that great.  People betting on a game doesn't really affect the 'football players' that much.  It all depends on how much stock btc owners/investors think that CME wall street people know the btc market.  Some will, for sure... but my guess is that most won't.

you lost me at 'profit immensely'. who profits immensely?  the farmer? because he can get a little more than his 1000$ contract?  (I would give 1250 for a 1000 right that I could turn around and sell for 1500... or the trader, in this case, the same guy as me- paying 1250 (or some middle amount) for something that can be sold for 1500?  I see quick and easy (and small amount), but not 'immense'.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:45:17
you say 'earnings' but do you mean savings (buying at a lower price than had you bought yesterday at a higher price?)  earnings to me are gains from something I already own. and if it's going down, anything I item is earning less, but I do save if I wait and can buy at a lower price

I hear this alot: 'it's up to you too stay informed' by people who aren't willing to answer any questions or point out any sources.  (I acknowledge that you give some search strings). it's not super helpful to tell people to stay informed and then refusing help.  if you can't help, that's fine, but no need to scold someone in the same sentence, that just comes off  as dickish to me.  In my humble opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:27:29
A deflection!  'Contraire', indeed...  No, I wasn't really talking about any particular intrinsic value.  We were speaking of the reason why one may or may not believe that Bitcoin's value would continue to rise, 'ad infinitum'.  
But let's take your envelope.  If your envelope, useful as it may be- with all the use and utility you prescribe to it, if there were only 500,000 of them in the world, no more of that type to be created ever again, do you think that the value of those envelopes would rise over time?  That, as they get destroyed (or lost might better fit the analogy), that this would increase the value of the remaining ones?  Maybe.  For a time.  For as long as our humble little envelope remains a useful curiosity, absolutely.  But I don't think that our envelope would eventually rise to hundreds of thousands of dollars.  Certainly not in the long term.  It's a great envelope.  It does a lot.  But already people are saying it's a little small.  You actually can kinda see through it.  It's a little short, you have to fold  some kinds of paper over to fit it in.  Some people are already talking about making envelopes that are a little bigger.  It's a big debate, but by and large some kind of solution of that type is in the future.  
Our little envelope isn't the only kind of envelope possible.  And it's not the only way to send my grandkids $100, either.  
And this speaks to part of why I believe the way I do- The code and idea behind bitcoin may be revolutionary, it may be elegant, and do a lot of things that nothing else has ever done before.  Honestly, I don't have the technical ability to say, but I take what I read and see at face value.  And that's why people get so worked up about it.  And great, I value the ideas of security, speed, decentralization, etc. as well.  It's the first, and it's very good at what it does.  And that has tremendous value.  But it's not the only (mainstream) envelope in the world.  At least, in won't be in several years.  And with a capped supply, I don't see it endlessly increasing in value.  Not sure I would with an upcapped supply either, but that's a moot point.

a thanks! But beneath the intellectual curiosity there does sit a sarcastic prick, though... just sayin'...(But always as a force for good, lol..)   :-)
@_date: 2017-11-16 05:00:08
what, to 'infinity'? that doesn't seem to make sense.  it's generation levels off, it's scarcity levels off, it's utility plateaus.  price stabilizes.

@_date: 2017-11-15 23:44:07
but it won't though, it would just normalize somewhere, and probably somewhere lowish.  I mean, I don't hold the 20$ in my pocket waiting for it to explode in value.  at some point the novelty wears off and the utility stabilizes.  what's the growth potential when it's just another stable, available currency?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:37:09
While poking around I found this:  It's a google spreadsheet plug in that automatically calls market info- price between two designated currencies, market cap, etc.  Take a look, you might find it useful-
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:20:28
well, keep in mind that's only speculation on my part. might be worth a call.  or be prepared to check your statement and pay it off immediately if so.  just seems to me more of a financial transaction (if through an exchange) than a 'purchase'.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:53:50
Ah.  gotcha, thanks-
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:22:45
they could be looking for someone specific.  terror group, high level drug dealer, etc.  they could be following a trail that leads to coinbase.  maybe all they know is 'many transactions between '12-'15 and 'drug money' (ie over 20,000)

*House prices keep going up.  Does that mean they will increase to infinity?*
I don't know, from the way you put it, in a thread that talks about valuation in the millions of dollars, it seemed to me you might be arguing that probability.  Or, with your conviction, it's eventuality.
Houses provide something.  Shelter, storage of goods, privacy.  But everyone must have a home (excluding the homeless, transient, etc. etc.)  And people must buy them, rent them, or mooch them (live with parents, etc.).  Housing also represents land.  And land is very important, or else, what would we stand on?  Where would we walk our dogs?
People don't have to have bitcoin, or any other crypto-currency.  At some point the cost of acquisition will rise above any benefit of owning it.  With a limited pool, and saturated exposure (everyone who has had a change to own one gets to), I see it leveling off.
In thinking about this thread, I tried to find some asset that I think it compares to.  After considering houses, 'high art', money and gold, the one that I think it most closely compares to is silver.  Art appreciates, but is so expensive it's out of the range of most. 
It has asthetic value. You can show it off. But You can't show off bitcoin, I mean, not really, beyond novelty.  It has prestige, and so might bitcoin, but that doesn't really speak to me.  Gold is pretty and has asthetic value, and is mostly valuable because of that.  Like art it can be displayed, demonstrating wealth.  Bitcoin lacks that demonstrability.  Gold also has utility, in electronics.  Silver is the same, except that utility is gone since the (near) death of print photography.  But it's a store of value, can act as a medium of exchange, has some minor asthetic value.... And I don't believe silver is appreciably appreciating.  And if it is, not to the point of being a valuable investment tool.  
Bitcoin is also technology.  And what modern, digital technology has staying power?  It's almost an oxymoron.  Crypto or blockchain may be around in 50-75 years, but I don't believe Bitcoin will be in any meaningful way.  It's value is only that which we give it.  And (I believe), we give it, at least now, mostly because we think we'll get a return on it.  At some point it will level off, other technologies will come around, and it'll essentially go away.  Might play some small roll in something, but not as a 'major asset.'

@_date: 2017-10-13 02:54:48
Lol... It kinda seems that way.  There are the experts who just 'know' (and maybe can't explain it in layman's terms, lol..), people who have their way and it's the only way (and maybe can't explain why in layman's terms, lol...) and then people like us.  'lol'.
(That's not a diss on people replying/btc traders.. just a general lament on how complicated I'm finding this whole thing.  I get it, new technology, etc. etc.  But still....)

@_date: 2018-03-23 00:48:48
Yeah, you could put 5 or 10 dollars aside 'in a jar' or somewhere, then when you have 50-100 dollars you could invest it somewhere.  Meantime you could read and learn, track Bitcoin to see how much you would have gained or lost, etc
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:24:36
That's because you have no intrinsic value, lol....
