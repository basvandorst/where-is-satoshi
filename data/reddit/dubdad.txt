Lucky, aka fortunate, to have liquid funds to purchase more BTC at the dip.

This is how I read all of this as well. Drunk tech trips, pulls cord, breaks shit.

I'm HODLing hard core but it bums me out that the all the exit scammers cost me more btc than i hold now...

Long term this is a good thing. Short term I'm fucking pissed because I lost 3bc to those assholes so this is costing me then, and now, and into the future! Fuckers!

I'm going to assume you've emailed support, I find that I get a reply in 4 hours or so. Maybe 6. I've used it twice.
Sorry you're struggling, I feel your pain and couldn't buy coins the whole last week so I missed the rush from 1700...

It has to come from the right bank account or it will not go through. I imagine you'll have to figure out how to cancel it through Schwab.
I did a wire this am and it was in in under 2 hours.

I signed up for Gemini a week and a half ago when cb decided to revoke my instant buy abilities (and I had a long track record with them and a high instant daily buy limit).
Apparently Coinbase no longer likes credit cards with PO Boxes for billing addresses and you have to have a cc on file with them to do any instant buy.
Well guess what, I live in the middle of nowhere where the USPS can't be arsed to bring me my mail (the po is 3 blocks down my same street).
I tried for 2 days to get a cc to validate with them, with tens of attempted charges, to no avail. I emailed them several times and never got a human response. I did figure out the "no po boxes" thing through their support site.
But what's a cat to do that doesn't get home delivery? And why not email me back to tell me that is the case?.
So long story short, my AML verification was taking a little longer than I expected, so I emailed them. They got back to me within an hour or two. They confirmed the delay and said it would be the next day for verification, which turned out to be the case.
They have a 500 dollar instant credit on an ACH deposit, and you can wire money to them and it is available within a couple of hours. I've used both with success and their trades seem to execute quite rapidly.
YMMV but HODL!
