Buy a dog tag. Stamp your private key on it
@_date: 2016-08-29 03:52:03
I have a whole private key on it
@_date: 2016-08-28 17:09:41
Exactly what I do. I use stainless steel dog tags.
@_date: 2016-08-01 16:40:37
What is the error it was reporting?
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:39:32
Dogecoin confirms in 1 min and has a freaking dog on it.
Nuff said

Why are you popping ish?  Mind yourself..
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:50:44
I’d argue dogecoin does add value.  It’s got 5x throughput capacity and super cheap fees.  Not a great store of value but a good transactional coin

It's all written in the blockchain.  That where all of the coins are and that's where all 21 million end up
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:49:49
I can
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:47:07
Technically it's get''s with a double apostrophe because it is possessive and also a contraction.
@_date: 2017-02-04 12:31:31
The 21 million DOES include Satoshi's coins
@_date: 2017-03-07 12:22:52

If it had a dog on it, yes.

Why are you so negative in every single comment you make?  Angry at the world or just bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-31 22:48:11
I think it only makes sense to save into bitcoin for 3-4 years.  After that the value increase of your holdings dwarfs your added savings by an order of magnitude.

It's a mirage.  If everyone who thinks they should have had bought back then the price would have ballooned.

Every time I hear ignorant people talk about bitcoin it makes me feel like it's the best place to have my money.  Heard a guy on Bloomberg last night say "it takes more and more code to produce a bitcoin".
Idiot people have a purpose especially when they are on the television.

Other people's ignorance can be your fortune.
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:53:16
I have a PhD too.  He doesn't understand it, clearly, and misses the features of bitcoin that make it special.  Limited supply.  Bearer instrument. Backed by proof of work.  Therefore it has the features of gold but can fly across the planet in minutes.  Not to mention it is a trustless timestamp.  Not to mention aliens could look at the Blockchain and verify the computational work required to contruct it.

If you like something at $1000 you should like it 4x at $250.

I’m not going to argue your point.  It’s well taken and kudos for your couple hundred coins of inventory and staff.  You sound well positioned in the heirarchy.  Hopefully your resentment will serve you.
@_date: 2017-11-01 19:36:22
Women like to set the goal posts.  Men work hard, to get the money, to get the car and house...for the affirmation of a woman.  
They simply let the male heirarchy sort out the leaders and then like to get the fruits of that pyramid.
Bitcoin represents a shifting male heirarchy and it kind of makes them nervous.  Like the thing they scoffed at because it wasn’t “real money” is now “the realest money” 
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:15:43
I mean the coins that got dumped on that news.  
It went down to $60 I think.
Sorry for your loss
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:27:37
I bought those coins.  It was a sweet dip.

Women don't care about bitcoin until it goes into a bubble and they get dollar signs $ in their eyes.  They will never have bitcoins in their eyes.  
Don't try.  It will hurt your relationship

Don't forget:
making a private/public key pair offline.  
Stamping your private key into sheet metal.
@_date: 2017-09-20 12:46:11
Thanks for doing this.  That took time and effort.  It was generous of you and in the spirit of the talk.
@_date: 2016-09-23 00:27:57
You can make a public bitcoin address and the associated private key on a computer that is not, and never will be, connected to the internet.  Then you can physically stamp that private key into metal.  Then you can send funds to the address and be confident it is secure.  This is cold storage.  Stamping in metal makes it fireproof.  You are ready for the zombie apocalypse
@_date: 2017-09-01 09:31:36
Yes.  The increase in fiat value of my bitcoin now dwarfs what fiat value I could put in through monthly savings.  3-4 years later...
Let's say I have $500 a month to save but at this point in time my bitcoin holding increases in value by $5000 per month.  At this point it makes less sense to save in bitcoin and hedge the volatility of BTC with a more stable savings vehicle

@_date: 2017-05-20 15:41:33
In bitcoin the users and the shareholders are one and the same.  To USE bitcoin as a store of value means taking on RISK.  There is capital inverstment for users storing value.
Users and shareholders in a social network are NOT one and the same.  USERS take on NO RISK.  There is no capital investment for users.
You seem well intentioned but your arguments could use refinement.  Privately owned social networks and open financial networks do not have the same dynamics
@_date: 2016-10-28 12:29:40
Mycelium is open source.
Jaxx is not.
@_date: 2017-05-20 01:03:46
If Bitcoin goes the whole idea of crypto as a store of value goes with it.  It's not going to be displaced because its missing Segwit/LN
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:27:26
I understand your point and explained why it's flawed.
"If bitcoin can be displaced as THE digital store of value then so could its replacement. If this is the case then the whole proposition is faulty and crypto is just a game of jumping from bubble to bubble."
Bitcoin is simply digital proof of work, scarce, transferable, immutable, uncensorable and open.  Those features are all it needs.  There will be other digital monies but bitcoin will always be THE STORE OF VALUE otherwise there is no store of value.
@_date: 2016-10-26 01:38:33
Watch it go up. And down. And up.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:31:48
Facebook is not a store of value.  There is no associated risk.  Pushing capital into crypto entails risk.  These are not equivalent.
Do you really believe in the market cap of alts like Ripple?  Sorry if you think that's a real metric.  
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:40:24
I think it does makes sense to have a different scaling on x.  Maybe not log scale but some other scale.  The last consolidation was long and after the next bubble consolidation could take a decade, or more.
@_date: 2016-10-26 00:42:58
@_date: 2017-05-21 00:20:54
Your tone is off.
Good day
@_date: 2017-05-20 07:22:58
The issue is with belief.  If bitcoin can be displaced as THE digital store of value then so could its replacement.  If this is the case then the whole proposition is faulty and crypto is just a game of jumping from bubble to bubble.
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:38:15
Honestly bro.  This is the real benefit.  Bitcoin puts you in touch with the deep.  It got me more into programming and markets.  It's also given me zen in turmoil and helped me deal with fluctuation and loss. It's made me rich and helped me learn about austerity and savings.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:30:17
Doesn't jaxx require you to sweep the whole amount?
Mycelium makes a transaction that sends all the change back to the paper wallet then forgets the private key.  Handy
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:13:34
Winning an argument

Are three different things
@_date: 2017-05-02 11:48:48
Thanks.  You really understand me
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:14:52
There's no other wallet that lets you spend from a paper wallet without sweeping it.
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:59:42
It's better than sweeping though if you don't have another paper wallet at that moment.  I call it a warm wallet.
I wouldn't say it defeats the purpose but it does reduce the security.
Example: if a virus on your phone is doing screen capture and has your backup phrase this method will still protect you.  With sweeping you would be compromised in this circumstance

Ok.  Security experts here.  
The features in mycelium have not been replicated in other wallets.  It is well designed and functions consistently.
Jaxx is crap. 
Breadwallet is good but very simplistic
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:30:31
I would also split the paper wallets so that they are not all the same denomination.  With 10 bitcoin maybe you want to split it as 5,2,2,1 so that you'll have options of which one you want to use when it's time to move it
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:50:03
Technically the first democracy was in 50,000 BC with Benjamin Franklin and Colonel Sanders as CoPresidents.  That's basically a proven fact and if you watch history channel it's so obvious.  It's how everything came to be with tv and food and the other stuff around us.
