"In June, Mt. Gox stopped letting users withdraw funds in US dollars, saying it had to deploy some technical changes that would speed up transactions. It now seems more likely that the company was just tapped out after the **government raid** and wanted to stall customers."
"Offline wallets are generated from an offline system and kept in paper format in three separate locations, using a technology based on **raid**. It will likely be changed to use Shamir’s Secret-Sharing method in the future, and all existing offline wallets will be converted to this."

If they said "Bitcoins are illegal, don't use them", people would (mostly) ignore them. This kind of "light on the users, heavy on the businesses" just gives them leverage for later when they tighten up the regulations.

English translation:
※ Instant Global Transaction / Zero Handling Fee
“Bitcoin” is an internet exclusive virtual currency that allows for purchases and international money transfer over the Internet with minimal transaction costs. Although there have been an increasing number of users globally, there are still not as many users in Japan. To test their level of convenience, I purchased some currency and attempted to use them.
First, I searched for a point of exchange in order to trade yens with Bitcoins. There are about 20 known exchange points over the net that caters specifically for Bitcoin, but about 70% of the amount of monetary transactions (about 50 billion yen per month) is suggested to be through Mt. Gox, whose management office was located in Tokyo.
I created an account with them over the net.
Documents such as a driver’s license, which verifies both identity and address, must be scanned and sent after registering your personal information. The application procedure is no different to applying for an online bank account, and takes no longer than 30 minutes. The account was then created within 2 days. To test the account, I transferred 30000 yen from my bank account to the account specified for MTG, and I confirmed on the following day that the money was transferred into the new account opened with MTG.
Just like the yen, the market rate for Bitcoin is frequently changing. On July 1st, the market rate for 1 Bitcoin (BTC) was about 9000 yen, but on the 5th the market rate fell to about 6000 yen. The rate climbed during the setup of my account, and by the time I ordered 3 Bitcoins the rate was at 8960 yen. Transaction was completed within 1 minute with a 0.6% transaction fee. It cost 160 yen to acquire Bitcoins that were worth 26880 yen. Currently, there are 570 thousand users registered with MTG globally, the highest number being from the US at 36%, followed by the UK at 7%, then China at 5%. The number of Japanese users is less than 1%, at around 1650. 
I proceeded to try and use the acquired Bitcoins to purchase a watch on a US Electronic Commerce (EC) website “Bitcoin store”. The price was 0.91 BTC ($77 based on the market rate at the time). After selecting to purchase, the instruction stated that “I was required to transfer funds to the Bitcoin address within 15 minutes”.
The address is like an account number with combinations of letters and numbers. I copied the address and pasted the address into the MTG account website, and entered the required Bitcoin amount including shipping fee. I was surprised to find that the transaction was cleared immediately.
The process took 5 minutes since this was the first time of use and I was unclear of the procedures, but with experience it would take no longer than 30 seconds to complete. There is no handling fee for transactions. If this was a dollar transaction with credit cards, currency exchange and handling fees of 1% or more would have applied in most cases. The watch arrived after 1 week without any problems.
There are also some stores that allow the use of Bitcoins. “The Pink Cow” restaurant at Roppongi began to accept payment for food and drinks with Bitcoins from late July. Transaction is completed with ease by reading the QR Code using a smart phone. The owner Traci Consoli says that “There is no need to pay transaction fees to credit card companies. Once you get used to it, it is really easy to complete transactions, so it is very handy.”.
※ Risks of Sudden Fall of Value
Roger Ver, a corporate representative in Japan for a US sales company dealing with electronic components, have been using Bitcoins to pay their suppliers in China. The million yen per month transactions are almost immediate, with no transaction or currency exchange fees.
In previous times, the bank would have had to exchange the dollars for Chinese Yuan before transferring the funds to the Hong Kong bank used by the Chinese suppliers, thus going through a painstaking effort that would have resulted in a large fee. Ver has stated that “Bitcoin truly demonstrates its strength of surpassing borders when it comes to transactions”.
Company employee Ken Shishido holds some of his assets in Bitcoins. Since the circulation aggregate is decided upon by a program and the fact that Bitcoins are finite in the same manner as real cash, he reads that “when a financial crisis occurs, money will gather in both cash and Bitcoins”.
However, there are risks. The market rate of a Bitcoin to a dollar at the start of the year was $13 to 1BTC, but following a sudden rate rise to $266 in April, the rate then dropped sharply to $70. Finance consultant Yoshiya Noguchi has stated that “using Bitcoins for everyday use is risky”. 
From my personal impression, I found that transactions made as I shopped online on US websites were mostly immediate with no handling fees, and showed a relatively good level of convenience. However, it also left some concerns that any Bitcoins I retain may suddenly lose their value. Therefore, I did not feel any urge to use them to the point of exchanging large sums of yen.

"all accounts frozen at the same time" &lt;- This worries me.
If this happened at different banks, at the same time, it suggests collaboration or an order from above.

My estimate - over half a million.
The recent Asahi Shinbun article says that there are 500,000 registered MtGox users.

I knew they were having lots of problems, but I thought they were still functional to some extent. Will remove for time being.

Because I don't want people paying the scammer?

Well it's working again now, so not sure what happened. Difference between www and non-www version? The connection is unlikely to be hijacked. I'll check the cert info more closely next time.

You should mention your country. Maybe someone here can be a go-between.

An Original Currency, Settled Over the Internet.
The "Bitcoin" World Grows.
The number of people using using a virtual currency named "Bitcoin", something that only exists within computers and the Internet, is gradually growing larger.
This strange currency, that does not require countries or central banks, may become the new shape of money.
Has a limited amount, is similar to gold.
The reason an Englishman, Jonathan Waller (29), working in the IT industry in Tokyo, started to use Bitcoin two years ago, was that he was annoyed that when doing international remittance, the bank took thousands of yen [tens of dollars] in transfer fees. Running a online shop as a side business, he ordered keychains from a factory in China, but that payment was in Bitcoin. "It's really simple, and I can freely manage my own money" he says.
The way to use it, is to change dollars or yen to bitcoin using the Internet [using an exchange], and sending [the bitcoins] to a friend. The friend receives [the bitcoins], and changes them into his local currency using the web. He then withdraws [normally] from his own bank account. The difference from things like "PayPal", the electronic payment system, is that the [bit]coins have their own value, and have a varying exchange rate. 
In addition, [bitcoin has] the feature of having no central owner. In order to make it work, there is no central server - the participating individuals' computers connect and enable transfers. In 2009, a document was published under the name "Satoshi Nakamoto", and people interested in the technique made the system real. [I know that's not really what happened - I'm just translating what it says.]
[PHOTO] Exchange for the virtual currency "Bitcoin". Young Japanese and foreigners face computers.
A building in Shibuya, Tokyo. This is an exchange, called Mt Gox, where you can change world currencies into (and out of) bitcoin. There are 50,000 registered users, and it manages 70% of the world's bitcoin currency trades. A French entrepreneur bought the website, and built up the business.
"Bitcoin has no central bank, and no central management. It's just like gold." says Gonzaag Gabsheri (39) [Not sure of the English spelling], head of marketing [doesn't say where]. Bitcoin is mainly used for net sales and money transfer. The number of businesses using it are increasing gradually. At the end of April the Australian "Digi Deals" domestic appliances net-shop started to take bitcoin, and in Europe and North America, there are eating and drinking places which use bitcoin. 
However, the reason that many people are interested in bitcoin, is not just because it is really convenient. They are influenced by global financial dangers.
People have started to become worried about the inflation caused by the USA's programme of quantative easing. Also, in the European debt crisis, there were whispers that customer funds held at banks could be blockaded. Just like gold, because the future amount will peak out at a set level, [bitcoin is] seen as a safe asset unlikely to collapse in price, and so it has gathered funds. 
Also feeling cautious about the votility...
In January this year, one unit was 15 dollars, but [the price] temporarily spiraled up to acheive 200 dollars. After that, it recieved an attack from hackers, and violently fell to, now, around 100 dollars. It is a small market; the complete value of all the currency ["market cap"] is 20 oku dollars [2 billion dollars] (about 2 sen oku yen [200 billion yen]), and violent movements in price continue.
In Japan too, one voice says: "I moved 1 sen man yen [10 000 000 yen = 100 000 dollars] into bitcoin, and [then] at one time, the value went up by 20 times" (30 year old man). The authorities too, are nervous about the movements of the new money. In a report by the Central European Bank, they pointed out that "This mechanism is very risky. In the near future, it is conceivable that regulation authorities will start to act."
Sebastien Gari a Currency Strategist at the large French finance [group] Societe Generale says "Because a problem in the design of bitcoin, it became used for speculation.", however he goes on to say, 
"This [new] type of "electric money" is extremely promising. Possibly in the future people will build various kinds of new currencies and ways of settling payments."

　ネット仮想通貨「ビットコイン」
　国際決済、一瞬で／手数料ゼロ
　インターネット上のみに存在する仮想通貨「ビットコイン」。低い手数料でネット通販の決済や国際送金に使うことができるため、海外では利用者が増えているが、日本ではまだ少ない。使い勝手はどうなのか、記者が実際に入手して利用してみた。
　まず手持ちの円とビットコインを交換するため、取引所を探す。ネット上には20程度のビットコイン専門の取引所があるというが、金取引量（月間約500億円）の約7割を占める「Mt.Gox（MTG、マウントゴックス）」の運営企業が東京都内にあると聞き、ネットで口座を作った。
　個人情報を登録し、運転免許証など個人と住所を証明する書類をスキャンして送信する。ネット銀行に口座を作るのと同様の手続きで30分程度で申請作業は完了。2日ほどで口座ができた。試しに3万円を自分の銀行口座からMTG指定の銀行口座に振り込むと、翌日にはMTGに開設した新口座に3万円が転送されていた。
　ビットコインの相場は円相場と同じように、刻一刻と変動する。7月1日には1ビットコイン（BTC）=9000円前後だったが、5日に6000円台まで下落。手続きが完了するまでに相場が上昇し、結局8960円の時点で3ビットコイン注文した。1分以内に取引が成立し取引手数料は0.6%。2万6880円相当のビットコインを手に入れるのに160円ほどかかった。MTGの登録者数は現在、世界で57万人。米国人が36%を占め、次いで英国人7%、中国人5%、日本人は約1650人と1%にも満たない。
　「ビットコインストア」という米国の電子商取引（EC）サイトを見つけ、入手したビットコインで腕時計を買うことにした。価格は0.91BTC（当時の相場で77ドル）。購入を決定すると「15分以内にビットコインアドレスへ振り込め」と指示があった。
　このアドレスは数字や英文字を組み合わせた口座番号のようなもの。アドレスをコピーしてMTGの口座サイトに行きそのままはり付け、配送料込みのビットコイン料金を打ち込むと一瞬で決済され驚いた。
　最初なので仕組みがよくわかあず手続きに5分程度かかったが、慣れれば30秒とかからないだろう。決済に関する手数料はゼロ。クレジットカードでドル決済する場合は1%強の為替・事務手数料がかかることが多い。1週間後、自宅に無事時計が届いた。
　ビットコインを使える店もある。六本木のレストラン「ピンク・カウ」は7月下旬、ビットコインで飲食代を決済できるようにした。QRコードをスマホで読み取ると、簡単に決済できる。オーナーのトレイシー・コンソーリさんは「クレジットカード会社に手数料を払う必要もなく、慣れればすぐに決済できるから便利よ」と話していた。
　　価格急落リスクも
　米電子部品販売会社の日本法人代表のロジャー・ヴィアさんは仕入れ先の中国メーカーへの支払いにビットコインを使う。月数百万円分の決済はほぼ一瞬。送金や為替に関する手数料もかからない。
　従来は取引銀行がドルを人民元に換え、中国側が取引する香港の銀行に送金するため、かなりの手間と手数料がかかっていた。「ビットコインは国境を越えた取引に威力を発揮する」と話す。
　会社員の宍戸健さんは資産の一部をビットコインで持つ。ビットコインは流通総量がプログラムで決められ、金のように有限で「金融危機が起きれば、金やビットコインにマネーが集まる」とよむ。
　ただ、リスクもある。年初に1BTC=13ドル台だったビットコインの対ドル相場は4月に266ドルまで急騰した直後、70ドル台に急落。金融コンサルタントの野口能也さんは「日常で使うのは危険」と指摘する。
　記者の感想としては、米サイトでのネット通販でも決済は一瞬で手数料もゼロのケースが多く、使い勝手は悪くない。ただ、保有するビットコインがいきなり無価値になったら、という不安も残る。円をたくさん交換して、使おうという気にまではならなかった。

It's very information rich. Way too much to take in I think.
Depends on your audience, but for complete beginners, something which just covers the 5 or so main points might be better.

Fair enough, but it's a pretty normal (illustration) style for Japan.
