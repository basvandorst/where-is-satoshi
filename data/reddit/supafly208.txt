I'm 30 and quite impressed with your talents
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:47:34
Yea. Absolutely. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:42
Oh yea!
Having not actually owning a golf course, I didn't catch it right away.
Maybe I should start by getting golf clubs.

Yeeaa. I saw a buy order for 1100. Bummed me out 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:59:48
Ahh. Yes. You'll get used to seeing your account change by a few thousand.
Here's the trick: before you look at it, decided if you're going to make a move/trade depending on its current worth.
If not, don't even bother checking it since you're going not going to do anything with it anyway. It'll only mess with your emotions.

Yeeaaa. Same boat.  Diversifying is technically still possible, but it sure does feel weird having such small amounts spread all over the place 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:47:18
Uhhh... I was just referencing Scarface
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:08:55
Hah. Pretty much.

You're a good dude. Help a brotha out complete the downpayment on his first home?!  1 BTC would drastically change my life with my high school sweetheart!
I kid, i kid. You're doing good things with your funds and that makes you a good dude.  Hopefully this Pineapple Fund brings you the satisfaction you're looking for.   :)
Take care you lucky sob
Seriously though, Khan Academy helps thousands (or millions) of students around the world on a daily basis. This helped me get through college.

You're a good dude my dude.
You wealthy sob, you!
Have a good Christmas

My own boat, my own car, my own...golf course.

That's so sweet. Think of it as a change jar that generates and loses change as time goes by.
Every little bit adds up

Make a paper wallet and put 0.0083333 bitcoin in it. Roll that shit up  and snort some coke with it.
It's how all the guys in Teslas do it 
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:17:56
I will slowly keep accumulating until I have 1BTC.
I'm a poor, but I believe.
@_date: 2019-03-22 12:41:47
Aw shit.
You're going to make it taaaannkkkk
@_date: 2019-03-29 02:43:23
By "0.1 sats" did you mean "0.1 BTC?
@_date: 2018-06-21 04:27:20
Holy shit
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:56:58
How the hell do you read this chart? Are those the number of limit buys set in green and limit sells set in red?
So, as 10k approached, less and less people were buying, but a shitload sold at 10k?
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:41:32
I need to reinstall this!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:48:40
Congratulations man. You made a hell of a return on your investment and have put it to go use. Nothing wrong with that.
Best of luck with future endeavors!
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:00:30
Yuuup. It's been doing really well.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:59:36
You can send fractions of a btc. It's not like stocks where everything is in whole numbers.
Let's say one btc is 10k. You want to send your buddy 100 dollars worth. 
You'd send 0.01 BTC

All the transactions are on the blockchain. Think of the blockchain (in this case) as a cloud storage that has a log file for every transaction on every wallet.
The bus driver could receive dozens of transactions from customers in a day. All of these, no matter the amount, are stored in that cloud log file (blockchain). He could then update his wallet whether it be on his phone, on paper, in a nano, or w/e and get access to those funds.
It's starts making a bit more sense when you start playing with it. Buy a few bucks of it on coinbase and then send it to a bitcoin wallet on an exchange (let's say Bittrex). When you make the transaction, a transaction ID is generated. You can search online on a blockchain explorer for btc to see how your transaction got packaged and can view the confirmations. Once you receive the funds on bittrex, they're yours. You can then exchange it for other coins/platforms, send them to a friend's wallet, or w/e you want. 
The coins available get halved every 4 years, so it'll be a long time before we have to worry about there not being any (technically, it'll never reach 0). As supply gets thin, demand and price go up (theoretically).
When buying, send funds to USD (or w/e your country uses) wallet on coinbase. Go to gdax.com to buy btc with USD. Once complete, you can withdraw it to your coinbase wallet. Doing so will make it much cheaper than if you buy BTC directly from coinbase since they mark it up from market value and charge higher fees. GDAX is coinbase's exchange. It's meant for trading, while coinbase is meant for holding.
Edit: someone correct me if I'm wrong on something. I don't want to misinform people
