Well, you're forgetting that we're entering the age of actual coin applications rather than shitcoin and trophy token mentality. Watch the cap siphon to other cryptos as a measure of function. We'll see.

At this point, instead of comparing portfolio gains we're going to compete who has the biggest losses and who's the most in debt. Bonus points if your wife has left you and you're living out of your van.

The title says "Don't buy Bitcoin" but the description insinuates we **should** buy Bitcoin.. I'm better off with the latter.

Every time I see his tweet circulating, I think about how the individual must feel seeing his face as a meme. Followed by thoughts of outmost sadness, pulling out at 14$.

They're attempting to dumb it down for the layman, I suppose. 
The best part was "One of the leading cryptos is set to replace Cash within the next 10 years".

Going through your post history, you've got nothing but anger and negativity. Why is it that you made a throwaway account just to be angry?

Thank you for all the good that you've done; the initiative you've shown; your outmost generosity and perspective on the ever-changing world of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. You've moved mountains and helped shape the future of our community and the minds of eager individuals and teams looking to make a difference. I wish you the best of luck in your life.

If you're receiving institutional money, the presumption is that there are key players who see financial value and in turn will lobby for the legitimization of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Being the underdog, it didn't get much favour from government regulated bodies - and if the government recogniszs its authenticity, then businesses which underwent succesful pilots have less entries to barrier or legal stipulations to hurdle over. Once that is set, you'll see Wallstreet money, corporate operations budgets flowing through blockchain tech/crypto projects - it'll be a snowball effect. All we need now is that legitimization, the little stamp of approval.

On the flipside, I know people who do 1 hour of work and charge for 3-4, but due to their name and notoriety, clients do not even question the going rate and are happy to pay whatever the invoice states.

It went from comparing it to coal plants, then some other shit, then some other shit, now we're literally comparing it to GREEN VEHICLES. This is becoming a joke. What's next? Crypto uses more energy than solar/wind farms produce?

Are you also going to say "I just successfully fucked myself over in front of thousands of people and solidified my stupidity"?

Man, I really should be holding onto my Nortel then.. On a more serious note, think of how many times people would have panic sold between 1976 and now? People freak out over weekly trends.

I don’t know how that sort of gain would at all be realistic. But I think, and I say this as politely as possible, the outburst of media attention brought in not only new money but new *participants* (cant classify them as investors) who knew nothing of market mechanics and got played like a pump and dump group.

Reading some of the comments on LinkedIN always has me perplexed. Seeing people in positions of management; directors; business owners; etc - with no poise, insight, or rationalization really puts things into perspective. Either way, more often than not, the comments made are straight up fucking dumb.   
"I want real money!"   
You tap your plastic card, which transmits numbers of intangible assets from one account to another. What differs? Expand your horizons of knowledge and think of the concepts of security, application, scalability, ease of access, OWNERSHIP.

VEN, NEO, for instance. Sounds like it.

Lol a DCR is not just "buying a property". Buying stocks is as easy as buying Crypto - options, calls, that's not "just buying stocks". Nothing is complicated. A person who fails to  attempt to understand a concept will fail at anything they attempt.

Businesses wont accept bitcoin due to fears such as regulatory issues, fluctuation, or lack of available use-cases. Fix one, the others fall in line. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:21:17
I do - and my point still stands. *When you hear a bunch of middle aged men talking about their crypto "investments" you know that image is gone*. I refuted that by applying the same categorization to alternative investment vehicles. Don't think you're getting it. *Do you*.

I'm surprised that Roger Ver has made it this far without a lawsuit or a strong case against him for fraud/scams. He's gaslighting the community and deluding himself. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:15:26
That's the thing. Bitcoin has gone through 80% corrections, 200% corrections - over the span of 6 months, 8 months, the longest being 14 months. It doubled and halved in value. Most of the people who said they would be rich right now would've probably pulled out on multiple occasions and would have been nowhere near it. The people that did manage to get rich are mostly the ones who were involved in the community heavily, or completely forget they even had them to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:50:45
I don't know if you're being dense - you initially didn't understand a joke and are wanting to discuss things literally. I'm positing a claim that bitcoin as a transaction is not anymore "interesting" or "cool" as buying real estate or buying stocks - at the same time nor is it any less fruitful of an investment just because middle-aged individuals talk about it. The technology behind bitcoin is hard to understand as a procedure and a concept; one in the same, real estate and stocks have complicated underlying procedures which are harder to understand. Do you. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:51:27
If people were hoping it would be a currency then they would strive to maximize its use-cases and attempt (or succeed) to use it on a daily basis with merchants, services, billing, pay and other implementation, whereas everyone is holding on to their bitcoins under the assumption that it will one day increase in value. Does that sound like a currency or an investment?
@_date: 2018-04-27 19:55:11
How does someone who is supposedly an *incredible crypto investor, advisor, expert, mentor* get so *supposedly* careless with literally every step of the process of owning crypto? With that in mind, I'm on board with the "Pls IRS I got hacked" theory. Nothing of the transaction process, sourcing, or due process makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:26:53
Boy, I remember seeing middle aged men talk about their stock/real estate *investments*. Those old rascals and their crazy ideas of investments. In all seriousness, the media blew things out of proportion but at the same time exposed it to mass-market main-stream developments and the industry is moving at an exponential rate.

Okay, that, I'll agree with. Steam used them too but then dropped.. Even Reddit dropped it?

Ever tried to get a DCR mortgage/lending deal based on the rental income generated by 3+ properties? Ou shit that's a feisty complicated deal. Options + calls aren't the easier to understand with stocks either. Not as complicated as buying/selling BTC (although some people make the process of transferring to a different address or hardware a fucking nightmare) but on par with mining or understanding the concept.
