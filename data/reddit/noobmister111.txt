I'm just a very pessimistic person something i need to work on  , his  train of thought is aligned with how I'm seeing things at the moment  , I also think your not factoring in people who also got in early but for small amounts and then continued to buy as price increased , I just don't see people rushing in to buy at high prices after seeing it go from 20k to 7  , unless something massively positive happens l

do have a price guess for Bitcoin ? Do you think it's gonna completely tank ?

Don't you think it's different because the prices are a lot higher, Difrerent thresholds , people would have to risk a lot more at these price levels

I really wish what you just said didn't make sense , but that's what it seems like to me

Ha I'm afraid you have over thought this believe it or not there are regular people out there such as myself who have gotten greedy and maxed out there cards and bought  into the 50-100k hype and now that it's dropped so severely , feel like they prob walked into a trap , 
I hope I'm a 100 percent wrong and I hope people save my post and make fun of me for years to come because I thought it was all crashing because it went to 9k . Your comment has added even more to my worry because , I can totally see myself stumbling upon a topic like this and seeing your message like so many others  and thinking to myself "ya this guys probably right this is just some troll with a agenda " and it would give me some peace of mind but since I know I'm just a normal dude ,with concerns this all sucks

I hope so ,but  I find it hard to imagine regular people investing at 15-20k numbers again , I understand Bitcoin has gone through these patterns but I think at these levels it's a different ball game ,
