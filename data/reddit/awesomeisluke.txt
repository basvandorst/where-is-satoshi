To be fair, I still don't fully understand bitcoin, despite my multiple attempts at reading about it.

Part of bitcoin's purpose is to eliminate the possibility of a reversal. It's built so that reversals can't be made without a consensus, which would also reverse any transaction made in the following blocks.
However, there's nothing to stop one of those companies from using an escrow service built on bitcoin.

I'm buying at 110, anticipating a revival as soon as an exchange starts selling below 100

Currently, the ease of converting fiat to bitcoin and vice versa. Some regions are easier than others, but in the US you mostly have to enter your bank account and credit card information to instantly buy bitcoin online. Localbitcoins.com and bitcoin ATMs can be a viable option if you live in our near urban areas. But the bottom line is that it's to hard for the average person to buy and sell. Couple that with the fact that your average joe is content with his current payment options and there's your problem.

The bottom is above the current price?

Not at all actually. My bitcoin holdings are a small percentage of my liquid assets, and it's just that. I'd rather sell off some coin than dip into my savings.

I'll be honest: I'm just here for the gold

As a bitcoin owner, I'm not going to support a politician just because his campaign accepts bitcoin.

Not enough libertarian

Bitpay mitigates the problem of volatility by converting BTC to fiat using the exchange rate at the time of purchase.

I sold 3.75 bitcoin about an hour ago at a loss. The worst part is I've waited a few days to see if any bull action would happen and figured it'd continue sideways so I decided to sell now (got bills to pay soon )

UDP is a bad example though because it's still very wisely used 
@_date: 2015-03-26 16:54:32
They can't regulate bitcoin itself, but they can regulate exchanges and tax income from bitcoin (the US is already doing this).
@_date: 2015-03-28 15:24:55
Seriously, good god. I believe in bitcoin and think it has a ton of potential but it has just as much chance of failing as it has becoming the dominant payment system. It's hilarious that some people blatantly ignore the flaws in bitcoin.

You don't want to dip it in, they will melt. Using acetone vapor is much more controlled.

They are required by law (KYC) to detect and report suspected money laundering. Blame the government, not Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-03-10 16:26:50
I'll take some!
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:57:02
Lol seriously. I wouldn't worry about the banks at this point. If your government catches on, you could be in some pretty deep shit
@_date: 2015-03-31 16:54:54
Hey there! :)
@_date: 2015-03-05 17:48:59


I agree with your point, but don't forget the value of gold in electronics as well as the medical field. I'm not sure what these amount to but just sayin
@_date: 2015-03-31 14:41:36
The onus isn't on Coinbase to bear. I guarantee they won't question the government's regulations for fear of being shutdown. If you don't like the laws, it's on you (not you specifically, but the people as an entity) to elect officials and write those officials with your stance. Whether or not they do anything about it is, unfortunately, mostly out of our control. Regardless of all of this, you really can't blame Coinbase. They are just playing the hand they're dealt with.

This is really good news. I just posted my printer on 3d hubs a few days ago and was disappointed that the only payout option for this in the US was PayPal. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 13:37:06
I'm aware of what a bit is, it was my poor attempt at humor. It's a **bi**nary digi**t**, so it can be one of 2 (or 10 in binary).

Hey, it's a start. It's good to start with a small amount to get used to the ins and outs of cryptocurrencies. It'd be a shame to lose 1 btc (or more) because you aren't used to working with it.  
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:07:23


Don't discount the power of your presentation. If just a single person from that group was inspired enough by your speech to do more research, imagine him or her becoming an enthusiast, and then **them ** doing a similar presentation, and the cycle continues. It won't be long until bitcoin is an everyday household term. Well done!

It won't melt completely but you'll lose detail. I work with 3d printers everyday at home and acetone vapor is very safe when used in a sealed container away from flame or spark. I've used it many times to smooth my parts, and it's a hugely popular method among the reprap community
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:42:01
Anyone who assumed that was being naive. We're barely scraped 300, we can't look at the high price each day and say "oh yeah, this is the new floor". As far as I'm concerned, the floor is still 180
@_date: 2015-03-18 16:54:31
300 seems to be the next psychological barrier to break (if we're talking short term). I expect we'll exceed it in the next month (RemindMe! 1 month) or so. The recovery seems to have slowed down in the past couple of weeks but I think it'll continue overall. All of this is obviously pure (hopeful) speculation. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 22:00:36
It's normally not such a wild oscillation though
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:04:51
Started happening in the last hour. I'm no bitcoin expert but I thought it was interesting. Possibly related to the recent hack? 
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:28:50
Bitcoin has nothing to do with libertarianism.
