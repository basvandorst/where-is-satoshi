Welcome to the family. Enjoy the freedom Bitcoin brings!

I have no idea. I guess there’s a fat stack of propagandized people in this sub who think college is legit. ��
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:55:25
Wow, that’s legit!

Love this show! Episode 2 just hit YouTube as well: [
@_date: 2019-08-09 06:46:09
������ PRICELESS!!
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:21:17
This show is EPIC!
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:32:01
Amen Mark! No kidding!
@_date: 2019-06-03 05:13:54
This is freaking awesome! ��
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:33:46
Always. �� ...but I’m also grateful for what I have.
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:52:53
Hear hear!! ��
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:54:23
Agreed! This was the best scene from Episode  IMHO:  [ (porcfest) ��
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:13:49
Damn, gotta love it! Respect to guys who bought back then and held.
@_date: 2019-06-06 23:10:20
�� This is hilarious!
@_date: 2019-06-19 00:46:27
Agreed! Additionally, the way I see it, even if this may not align with your humor, why not support it? These guys are grass roots, self funding most of it and doing their best to support and grow the community. I think it's awesome.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:52:48
Me, too!
@_date: 2019-09-27 18:49:31
Agreed. ��
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:50:04
INDEED!! Well said.
@_date: 2019-09-27 03:55:21
Hope so my friend. As long as we can keep paper futures and derivatives from saturating the market. I think the supply shock will overcome much of this over time regardless, but it's already been an issue thus far.

@_date: 2019-05-22 06:55:14
Likewise. This show could be massive! At the peak of this next bull run, who knows? It could reach 10's of millions of people by then!
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:18:30
Holy cow! This just goes to show you we have a LONG way to go people!
