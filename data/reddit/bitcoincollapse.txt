Evaporation of bitcoin value is the issue in this thread, not plagiarism!

Btc as a technology is ok. 
As an investment there is no reason to be more than a couple of dollars.

Miners dump their bitcoins to cover their costs.
Mass adoption that we have expected is a fallacy.
I have been in since the price was $80. I did not not cash out when the price passed $1,000, and did not sell a single coin all the way down, because I believed the fallacy.
But now I am (finally) convinced that slowly and gradually the price will retun back below $100.

Nothing can save the price of Bitcoin, it evaporates day by day.
Over and out, save what it can be saved!

Run To The Hills 
White man came across the sea
He brought us pain and misery
He killed our tribes killed our creed
He took our game for his own need
We fought him hard we fought him well
Out on the plains we gave him hell
But many came too much for Cree
Oh will we ever be set free?
Riding through dust clouds and barren wastes
Galloping hard on the plains
Chasing the redskins back to their holes
Fighting them at their own game
Murder for freedom the stab in the back
Women and children are cowards attack
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Run to the hills, run for your lives
Soldier blue in the barren wastes
Hunting and killing their game
Raping the women and wasting the men
The only good Indians are tame
Selling them whiskey and taking their gold
Enslaving the young and destroying the old
Run to the hills, run for your lives

The illusion that bitcoin "has no cost" or "it is low cost" is now being realised by more and more people.
As an investment bitcoin sucks. The sooner one dumps it, the better.
Bitcoin has destroyed many bitcoin believers, who kept on their coins and did not sell when it was trading at the stratoshere, and will destory even more who still believe that the dead cat will bounce back.

I have been holding on since $1,100.
I decided to exit as I am more than convinced that the mass adoption that we all believed in, is no more than a fallacy.

With so many positive comments the price evaporates.
I have sold today all my coins at the highs of the day and already feeling relieved!

Gradually the price will go to that level.
