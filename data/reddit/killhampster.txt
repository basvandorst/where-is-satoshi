So are these "manipulators" making a profit? Then why would they stop?

My solar picnic table has one of these for AirPlay streaming, it's amazing how fast it boots and is ready to do work.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:42:05
What a poorly written pile.  The author actually quotes the rules for proof or work mining and then goes on to claim anyone can print as many bitcoins as they want because bits are free. Lol.  
@_date: 2013-04-15 00:04:41
Take your litecoin crap somewhere else.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:28:20
It will be a bubble right up until it is declared stagnate, or crashed.  Rinse and repeat 
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:12:02
This thermal camera is for sale in bitcoins 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:09:24
There is no final price for bitcoin. Such a suggestion is absurd.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:10:22
Congrats.  The only thing that is an even smarter buy than bitcoins is solar panels!
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:35:58
Rich people can buy more of something than poor people? Really?  How does price change that fact?
@_date: 2013-04-04 19:44:29
Why did you choose this moment to implement bitcoin ordering?  Is this the first you've heard of it or were you waiting for a certain benchmark?
@_date: 2013-04-25 06:01:18
I like how everyone thinks its ASIC proof.  Just like it was GPU proof.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:25:31
Let me get this straight, your faulty calculations gave you an unreliable result? Hmmmm
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:11:08
Oh, so you know the true value of bitcoins?  You must be very rich having profited from your insight.
@_date: 2013-03-31 01:23:02
Anyone can make a fake account you fucking butthurt troll.
@_date: 2013-04-02 00:14:25
Just wait, it should confirm eventually
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:25:40
You are asking him to defend a statement he didnt make.
@_date: 2013-03-31 05:15:33
Wow.  Seeing how lame people are really make me reflect back on my own past. Give them time, they will come around
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:00:50
I think you may be lost, this is r/bitcoin.  
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:49:14
That's not how mining works.  Bitcoin creation rate stays constant 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:00:55
So you didn't do one spec of research before ordering?
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:46:04
Bitcoin.  The one and only
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:00:00
Fantastic.  Love it.  
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:30:59
Oh boy.  At least it's not perpetual energy devices.
@_date: 2013-04-28 18:28:03
Probably the way to go.  We need a bitcion version of LMGTFY
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:23:30
You mis-typed inferior
@_date: 2013-04-25 16:03:22
It should be. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:32:04
How do you know it was all of their coins? How do you know it was their life savings? How do you know it was a mistake?  
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:59:37
You need a better grasp of the facts before you can start giving advice.  You are trying to make the story fit your narrative.
@_date: 2013-05-01 06:01:41
Down voted for being pointless, or something.  Don't know, don't care.
@_date: 2013-04-08 16:29:35
Indeed, put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:16:25
Don't forget the absolute falsehood that selling coins pushes the price down.  Every transaction requires a buyer and a seller.  
And the environmental damage thing screams out "I haven't thought this through"
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:32:47
Well written.  I will be sharing this one with some friends
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:04:30
Wow!  I wish I had spent mde time buying and less time being a dick.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 13:31:27
This is pure bullshit and I will never make the mistake of using that site again.  
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:13:39
Lol.  No big websites take litecoin, and none ever will.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:36:43
Go for it.  Do you hear anybody complaining they bought too early or too many?
@_date: 2013-04-07 16:44:03
I've got about 20ghash that I would be open to selling, but only to one big buyer.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:11:29
I heat my house with mining.  Asics are going to leave me pretty damn chilly
@_date: 2013-04-28 17:17:42
Lol. Right?  Every single one of these points has been talked about to death.  Now add some extra pessimism and shallow thought.
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:21:30
Lol. Litecoin is not a copy.
