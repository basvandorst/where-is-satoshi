How do you think lightning works?

That seems like a rather limited opinion. What is the security backup to hashing power? If you isolate the miners without an incredibly considered reserve position then the "potential" security offered by bitcoin evaporates.
If node agreement is used for security bitcoin is doomed

That's the problem with ideologues like yourself. You are so convinced of one random small point you can't see the bigger picture. You'll remain convinced of the decision to the bitter end while everything falls down around you.

I'm guessing you're not sure about much at all. That would explain your earlier comments.
