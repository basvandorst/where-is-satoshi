Great comments. I think it's highly unlikely that governments around the world will cooperate on banning Bitcoin because there's such a big incentive to get in on the Bitcoin game if it could be seen as an advantage over other countries, kind of like offshore banking and lax tax laws are an advantage today. And all it would take to keep Bitcoin surviving and thriving would be a few even very small countries (with a lot of reliable electricity).

Great points. It may come to this but I think extremely unlikely. Governments can't make everyone outlaws or they lose all legitimacy and I think in just a few years almost anyone with a brain and a bank account will be using Bitcoin. So we may have already passed the tipping point.

There are a ton of Visa and Mastercard Bitcoin debit card options already available and I think most Bitcoin purchases are prolly already being done with this option rather than using Bitcoin directly. So I don't think banning use of Bitcoin in stores would do much. I guess they could ban the issuance of physical cards, but they can't ban the issuance or use of virtual cards like cryptopay.me already offers (and which I use) that give you just the 16 digit number rather than a physical card. I guess countries could block certain exchanges, or all exchanges, in their country, but they can't stop peer to peer exchanges. We've already seen this unfold in China where the exchanges were banned but apparently the use and exchange of Bitcoin didn't slow down that much b/c of p2p options.

But we may well see big countries that decide to ban Bitcoin using their economic and other clout to induce smaller countries to cooperate on banning Bitcoin. I just don't see it being enough of a unified policy to achieve the goal of actually stopping Bitcoin from growing. The more I think about it the more it seems like the genie is out of the bottle and Bitcoin is set to grow within a decade or less to push out all fiat currencies. We'll see I guess.

My point is that cards like CRyptopay and SHIFT are just Visa or Mastercards like any other, but they draw money from your Bitcoin or crypto accounts, so from the perspective of the merchant there's no difference. And I think we'll see additional layers of anonymity if required to skirt government regulations.

But what wallets/apps even require business licenses when such apps are available from either official or unofficial app stores on most phone platforms? 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:10:43
That was almost a 100 years ago. Things have changed a bit. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 07:12:17
There are a ton of BTC debit cards already available that don't even show up as BTC (they're just like normal Visa/MC debit/credit cards), so I don't think this is an issue.

Good point about the lack of entrenched behavior among the populace, but I think if we give it a few years in the US and other countries we'll prolly see as much entrenched Bitcoin use as alcohol use before Prohibition b/c the price of Bitcoin is going so high that most people will see it as a smart, even necessary, way to invest in their future. And even if it were banned before it became widespread, the price of Bitcoin is set to continue to skyrocket in the coming years so we may well see a sizeable minority in countries where it's banned still seek it out through p2p options, and even using VPNs to do so, if required. I've just been in China and apparnetly use of VPNs is widespread among the populace, so even though sites like Facebook and Google are officially banned it seems apparent that at least for younger Chinese these are symbolic not actual bans. Same thing with Bitcoin in countries that try to ban it? I guess we'll see.

FYI and a follow up to my initial post: I've now almost broken even in just 2.5 months on my $1950 investment in Genesis Mining. Obviously a large part of that is the fact that Bitcoin has zoomed in that time period. But the fact that I can now reasonably expect to double or triple my money in this investment is encouraging. My payout for the 15 GH/s I bought began at .0045 BTC a day and is now already down to .003 a day due to difficulty increases. The daily fee is .00028 per day so it's looking like within maybe six months this contract will be canceled but I'm optimistic that I'll get about 1 BTC total by then and will have more than tripled my money. Others have similar experiences? 
@_date: 2017-08-30 02:42:28
They sell mining capacity to buy the miners. Like a loan, which can be hard to get for nontraditional investment models. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:27:07
So I've made my money back now in just three months and look to double or triple my money before the contract ends due to difficulty fee increases that swamp the fees that Genesis charges me. I'm about to sign up for a new contract at the same terms, but now that Bitcoin is more than twice the price when I bought back in June this contract should pay for itself even faster, all else equal. Thoughts? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:28:24
I think that was a fair critique back in June but Genesis is now offering a new Bitcoin contract under basically the same terms. And since Bitcoin has more than doubled it seems that it now is in fact a much better way to invest in Bitcoin than buying Bitcoin directly. Agree? 
@_date: 2017-09-06 01:29:17
FYI I've now made my money back after just three months and it looks like I'll double or triple my money within a year. Has your opining of this investment option changed due to these new facts or you still feel it's a bad investment?

It doesn't seem to be in English and I don't see much content. What do they have that could add to the crowd-sourced democracy idea? 
@_date: 2015-09-12 19:20:44
Great tip. They have created some important components of what I envision, but perhaps the key aspect of the direct democracy virtual nation I'm working on is crowdsourcing decisionmaking, starting with the creation of a constitution, and it's not clear how that vision fits with bitnation.co, but I will reach out to them for some dialogue.

I'm on track to recoup my investment in five months, if my current payout stays the same and price of BTC stays the same. After that it's all gravy in perpetuity. So what's the catch? You think difficulty rises too quickly to sustain returns? I bought 15 TH/s, which is equivalent to more than one T9, Bitmain's newest miner, and that would also pay for itself in about half a year. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:45:37
Why? Because of mining difficulty increases? It seems that the price of BTC should track mining difficulty increases so should be a wash over time, no? 
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:32:13
Yeah after my first week payouts have dropped faster than I thought as difficulty has adjusted upwards. Hard to know ahead of time if it's a good investment b/c of that change, but also hard to know what the future price of BTC will be. So even if it takes a year to produce 1 BTC, the $2k I paid for the mining could pay off in spades over time. But I could say the same thing about just buying 1 BTC with cash rather than buying cloud mining... I was hoping it would pan out with maybe 3-5 BTC over the lifetime of the contract but that looks extremely unlikely at this point. Do you have any thoughts on how mining efficiency will evolve? Do you think we'll keep seeing the big jumps in hashing power and energy efficiency that we've seen in the last few years? 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:48:57
Their business model is to build out mining capacity based on upfront investments from people like me. So it's basically a way of getting financing for their mining projects without going through banks or other traditional ways of raising money. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:50:03
So if your return has dropped about 10% why do you expect to receive back only 50-60% of your investment? Did you buy a contract for in perpetuity mining? Or a set term? I bought in perpetuity. 
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:32:46
yes it the was loose correlation that I was referring to. It seems over time that they will roughly match. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:32:51
They have generally quite good reviews on sites like cryptocompare and they have an actual address and are incorporate and have help desk, etc. They're not a scam. The question is rather what ROI can we expect. And that's why I posted here. If it pays back in six months, that's excellent. If it doubles in the next six months to a year that's amazing. and if it keeps doubling over time, that's about as good as it gets in terms of investment opportunities. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:31:03
When is eventually? I'm not seeing why you only expect 50-60%. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:50:13
Cool, thanks. I've only got two days return so far and the 2nd day is just a little lower than the first day (.00452397 to .0045216 2nd day) so I'll be tracking my progress also. Based on extrapolations from this two day trend (obviously foolhardy to extrapolate based on such little data) I get 2.7 BTC after two years and the daily payout is at .00278676.
