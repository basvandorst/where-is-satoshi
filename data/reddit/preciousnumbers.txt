Having been in Crypto since early 2013, and met the CEO of Airbitz in Amsterdam for Bitcoin2014, I've been using Airbitz as my primary wallet on both Android *and* iOS (simultaneously!) ever since and it's BULLET PROOF
Yeah, I've got all the other wallet apps too (Jaxx is COOL if you have ETH), but Airbitz, imho, is the best-of-the-best

I'm on Android and have *all* the hot wallets
After trying them out I've settled on Airbitz
It's a powerful yet user friendly wallet for my daily bitcoin transactions 
The dev team are capable and it's regularly updated
Check it out on Google Play:

Hi there SC! I've been bitcoining since 2013 and have several wallets active concurrently but find my 'go to' wallet is Airbitz. The devs are pretty FABULOUS and are open to suggestions (they added BitcoinAverage in their last release due to my request). 
But, for me, the killer feature is NO BACK UPS REQUIRED, if anything happens to you phone, simply replace it (Android or iOS) and re-download the Airƀitz app and you're good to go :-)

Airbitz just released their latest version (1.6.0) with improved handling of Transaction Malleability (although protocol changes to bitcoin core such as BIP62 are needed to fully resolve this issue)

I've just had a look on the Airbitz worldwide directory, and, although there's no current listings, if I was starving but had 5K in BTC I *guarantee* I'd eat like a King!
