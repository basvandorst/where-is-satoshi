that's why it works, because it's difficult to sell amazon gift cards, relative to other gift cards. you can't prove the value or validity of an amazon gift card until it's added to your account. the inability to sell these particular gift cards is the very reason why purse is capable of offering these discounts. I routinely get 25-30% off "factual" discount using purse.

this has nothing to do with anything. we're talking about potential insider trading of bitcoin cash, not bitcoin. coinbase still doesn't support btc-to-bch trades, so even that wouldn't've mattered. CME futures is only for bitcoin price, nothing to do with bitcoin cash.

If coinbase batched transactions, their customers wouldn't like the transaction lag. Exchange withdrawals are much slower than coinbase for this reason. Coinbase is a wallet, in addition to an exchange. Also, I agree with CSW's post, what makes it spam? They're paying the transaction fee just like all other valid txns. Core wants a good fee market, here it is.
Edit: Also it's pretty sad that all it takes to bring bitcoin to its knees is a single corporate entity not implementing segwit. If segwit needs to be mandatory, they should've hard forked it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:58:31
I agree. I never said something can be centralized and secure. I said maximizing decentralization isn't the goal. A secure crypto must be decentralized to a certain point, beyond which there are diminishing  returns for security and utility. maximizing utility while maintaining sufficient decentralization and security is the goal.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:55:23


No. Coinbase users do not represent a significant percentage of global *transactions*. Especially new users, who simply buy and hold on coinbase, and never/rarely do an on-chain transaction. The fact of the matter is, segwit does little to reduce fees (even at 100% adoption, fees would still be ~$10), which is all anyone cares about right now, and rightfully so, since the real purpose of segwit (LN/second layer) doesn't exist yet.

How do you know if your transaction will be confirmed if it's well below recommend fees? Do you have a different way of estimating the fee to be included in next block? The two sources I linked are reputable, and sending with less fee would just leave it up to chance, no?
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:32:37
did you even look at the chart (since activation)? adoption has actually decreased in the past couple months, from a high of ~18%. though the initial ramp up was probably artificial, it seems to have stagnated around 10%.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:39:36


vast majority of new users != vast majority of transactions. the percentage of transactions this groups represents is insignificant, especially because most don't even do on-chain transactions, they simply hold coins in their coinbase accounts.


Yes, but transaction adoption, not wallet provider adoption. The number of wallets that support segwit means nothing if the transactions to/from those wallets are not segwit on both ends.


Even if that were true, it would mean a minority of transactions occurring on LN. Also, there is good reason to believe LN adoption will be much slower than segwit adoption, because it's not simply a wallet software change, it requires hubs with liquidity opening channels, users opening channels with those hubs depositing the amount they plan to ever spend on the channel. LN is a much bigger hurdle than segwit.

I don't invest in cryptos that are not useful while being sufficiently decentralized and secure. decentralization and security mean nothing if the coin has no utility. Being a permissionless, censorless coin that is useful as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system is the goal, not maximizing decentralization while minimizing utility. decentralization is a means to an end, not the end in-and-of-itself.

Xapo. And Shift. But Shift requires using coinbase afaik. The benefit of Shift is that you can hold bitcoins, and it converts to fiat at the time of use, rather than converting to fiat at the time of deposit onto your Bitpay card. Also, Bitpay debit card charges $5/mo if you don't use it for over 90 days, I learned that the hard way.

True. But the financial gain must be from trading stocks/securities of a *publicly traded* company. coinbase is not public, and the gains were from a product sold by coinbase, not coinbase shares itself. by no definition could this be considered insider trading.
@_date: 2018-01-11 20:16:32


Everyone who uses LN will have to make at least 2 on-chain transactions (one to open and one to close the channel). Most will need to make more, to add funds to their channel, or to open a different channel. this all assumes the routing problem is solved, which so far is not. we are years away from LN being widely adopted, if ever.
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:45:49
insider trading is when ~~an employee/owner of a company trades his own~~ **a person trades a public** company's stock based on insider information. bitcoin cash is not coinbase stock. coinbase employees trading based on insider information of a major market opening up is equivalent to a NASDAQ trader trading on insider information of a major market opening up (coal futures, for example) which is completely legal.

This is the most important point. You can't blame exchanges/wallets/users for low rate of segwit adoption when the core wallet itself doesn't even support it with GUI yet.

False. the wallet creates BOTH btc and bch wallets automatically, and clearly labels them both. If anyone is confused by this, they're dumb, and they'd be just as confused by other multi-crypto wallets such as Jaxx. you've clearly never even used this app.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:16:46
that's not the point. the point is that even the people who developed/deployed the code for segwit, don't have a GUI for their own wallet.

yes. I don't imagine gdax will keep this up for very long. coinbase only recently started charging fees for withdrawals, and I imagine gdax will follow soon.

s2x had 90%+ industry and miner support up until segwit was implemented on Aug 1. only after segwit got implemented did support for s2x start to fade. the companies who supported s2x until the end were the companies who were true to their word in the nya.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:45:44


most users don't need to run a full node. only miners should run full nodes. mining is already relatively centralized. decentralization is a means to an end. we need a certain amount of decentralization, but the goal isn't to maximize decentralization, the goal is to have a working payment system.
Ultimately LN will lead to more centralization, as LN hubs will serve as trusted 3rd party payment channel providers who can censor transactions, require KYC, and collect fees (that otherwise would go to miners). LN will basically turn into bitcoin banks.


What makes litecoin better technology? BCH can also take advantage of LN. BCH fees are even cheaper than LTC.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:39:26

mining and mining hardware is not as monopolistic or centralized as you are portraying. anyone is free to compete as a miner, as a hardware company, as a mining pool. competition is good. we don't need regulation from core, we need healthy competition bred by capitalism.
btw, you realize you're advocating for all transactions to be processed through a single trusted 3rd-party company (blockstream) who can censor transactions over their LN hubs?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:57:41
that's nice, but what about before we reach worldwide adoption (i.e. NOW)? how will we ever reach worldwide adoption with fees north of $10? LN sounds promising, but that won't be ready for another year at least. LN and 2nd layer solutions will still work with larger block sizes. Why not, at least temporarily, increase the block size until a viable 2nd layer exists?


how did you reach this conclusion? do you have math to prove it, or just speculating based on what others say?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:31:03
[average transaction fee is currently $27]( they're probably just rounding up assuming the worst. in reality, the fee coinbase charges could be higher/lower than the average.
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:18:08

they are referring to the miner fees, which must be paid for transferring bitcoin between wallets (e.g. the fee to transfer BTC out of coinbase into your mobile wallet, or between two mobile wallets). you are referring to coinbase's fees associated with purchasing bitcoin from coinbase.

not necessarily. I used to buy things with bitcoin at a discount (gyft and purse.io) and simply buy back the amount of bitcoin I used for the transaction. I would always break even or even make money, until fees became prohibitively expensive.

no, if you want to use the core wallet/client, you must download the entire blockchain ~150 gb. running the core client is what is referred to as "running a full node", because you have a copy of the entire blockchain and can verify/broadcast your own transactions. but there is no reason why you would need/want to run a full node, unless you're just doing it for a hobby, or actually trying to mine (which requires significant hardware investment).

You're right it's not free. You're still paying a fee, it's just small. But there are a lot more transactions, so miners still make money. Feel free to post as much "spam" as you want to the blockchain, as long as you're paying the fee. Who am I to say what should and shouldn't be put on the blockchain? Your assumption is that node operators (miners) are doing it for charity, out of the goodness of their heart.

You're in the us so the "setup" is easy. Just setup an account on Coinbase, link his bank account (similar to paypal), and have payments sent to his coinbase address. If he starts doing significant amounts of business, he may want to check out coinbase merchant options or look into bitpay.

Just because you haven't received your invite doesn't mean Circle hasn't started sending them. I was fairly late to the game and received mine last week.

They'd have to set it up where you credit your account first. Since bitcoin is a push system, rather than a pull system (such as paypal and credit cards), it would be impossible for uber to charge you in bitcoin without them being at a temporary loss.

this is more of a lesson for credit card users than it is for bitcoin users. part of bitcoin's appeal is that proper use of crypto eliminates this danger. using bitcoin-linked debit cards is not proper use, it's a marketing gimmick.

To be clear, the ONLY way you can get tracking info is if the buyer sends you the tracking number. If they don't, you can request that they send you the tracking info, but they don't have to. It's in the buyer's best interest to provide tracking info, because you can confirm delivery without physically receiving the item (e.g. you're on vacation) if the tracking says it was delivered.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:45:32
from my experience, coinbase is cheaper than circle. Circle was cheaper when it first came out, but the last several times I've checked, coinbase wins.
edit: I wouldn't recommend an exchange like gemini for simply purchasing bitcoin. If you're just trying to buy some bitcoin at market rate, just buy it from a broker like circle/coinbase, it'll be faster/easier imo.
@_date: 2016-06-03 18:26:36
exactly. why go through the process of setting up an exchange account, funding it (waiting 3 business days for the money to transfer), then finally buying some at market rate, when you can purchase them instantly at market rate from circle/coinbase? exchanges are intended for traders and offer no benefit for buyers.
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:49:12
I'm guessing the panels are 360W at best? So 10 panels get you 3.6 kW at full sun, will run an s9 for 2.5 hrs. Noble idea, but hardly making a dent on your mining energy. I have a 10kW array, and I don't even mine.

yes, of course taking into account all fees. Circle has "no fees" but they have a higher $/btc rate. Coinbase has a lower $/btc rate but also has fees.

Both are pretty similar imo. Coinbase has the added features of an exchange (btc and ether), USD wallet, Shift card, and Vault chilled storage. When I buy, I check to see which one's cheaper, usually it's Coinbase.

BitPay is primarily a payment processor for businesses. They compete with Coinbase in this area, but Coinbase is also a broker and an exchange. They are both equally "legit". The debit card is BitPay's first consumer product, as far as I know.

This is not great advice for a novice. I own a trezor, and am very familiar with bitcoin and computers in general,  and it's not fool proof. I'd suggest either paper wallet or coinbase vault for absolute beginners. Plus these are free, trezors are &gt; $100

correct, all you need is a private key. the wallet.dat file is created/used by whatever software wallet you're running. Note that you don't NEED to use a software wallet; you can use a mobile wallet or web-based wallet, both of which are incapable of "loading" a wallet.dat file, but both of which CAN import a public/private key pair.
I suggest following this tutorial on creating/using paper wallets (which are a form of cold storage).

@_date: 2013-10-21 23:40:47
you can buy bitcoins on eBay using paypal. the exchange rate you'll get won't be very good though.
@_date: 2013-11-06 23:04:40
doesn't it take a couple days for the BTC to be added to your account? I only bought once from coinbase and it took a few days...was that just because it was my first transaction?
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:10:36
In their defense, my first transaction (buy) took over 2 weeks to go through. In that time, the price had doubled, and they honored the original rate.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:23:34
you can always buy direct from their [website]( no need for mobile app
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:50:15
I like using [bitpay's rate]( because it's the actual rate that many bitcoin merchants use.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:37:54
ok here's another question: what does [that transaction]( represent? It's not the transaction from Campbx to my wallet because it's only ~0.01 BTC. Also, how'd you find that transaction with it being blurred out?
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:24:34

[USPS money orders]( are $1.20 for up to $500, $1.60 for up to $1,000.
You also have to pay postage ($0.46).
Edit: you can buy up to $3k in one day with no questions asked, up to $10k with questions/ID required.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:43:18
Looks like they already passed their goal. $34k USD +  57.81BTC*($420/BTC) = $58k+
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:55:24
My go-to exchanges (I live in US) are Campbx and Coinbase. Generally I use Campbx for buying since their $/BTC is lower, and Coinbase for selling because their rates are higher and it's easy to deposit into my bank account.

[this is the official one]( 100% of profits go to Sean's outpost.
edit: I think the price needs updating given the recent rise in value. 0.08 BTC

Right...(initiate two-factor authentication on mt. gox)
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:34:03
That would be a good idea I think. All I really wanted was SOME explanation, like the [link]( kingfavorites posted. If I'd seen other people were having the same issue and coinbase had responded somehow I wouldn't've posted this.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:48:36
It's been more than a day past the expected date. Last time, same thing happened. Support got back to me and said sorry, it was "a bug" and they "re-initiated" the deposit. Then the deposit hit my account within hours of their response. Which got me thinking, if they can deposit that quickly, why don't they do it that way every time?

What about Dwolla? I've been using Dwolla to transfer $$$ to Campbx. That's not considered a wire transfer right? Any speculation on if/when they'll crack down on Dwolla?
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:20:33
thanks for all the info. you're the recipient of my first bit tip
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:22:41
yeah 0.0002 BTC was automatically included. it's coming from Campbx and there's no option for including miners fee for transferring BTC, but the blockchain app says 0.0002 BTC fee.
@_date: 2013-11-05 01:23:27
Coinbase is good, but the fastest ways are localbitcoins (meetup with someone locally and pay with cash) or [BTCQuick]( to buy using credit card. Coinbase will get you a better rate, but localbitcoins or BTCQuick are quicker/easier.
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:20:36
exactly. If I had received ANY response from Coinbase support (still haven't, other than CorgiDad above) I wouldn't've posted this. Even just the [link]( that posted would've been sufficient. Zero response is what made me worried, as they have been responsive in the past and I feared something was different this time.
@_date: 2013-11-08 22:26:22
ok so you're staying away from Campbx and Coinbase. Let me know if you find another viable option.

My dad has had multiple surgeries on his toes throughout his life. He finally tried acupuncture in his 50's and found it to be the best pain relief available for his condition.

You can already use bitcoin on amazon through gyft.com
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:29:39
I would give it a few more days. My deposit eventually came through about 3 business days after than I was expecting. Coinbase has been slammed lately and are experiencing growing pains, but they've always come through for me, eventually.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:00:29
Can someone explain all the numbers/address associated with [this transaction]( (labeled 1, 2 and 3). I understand that it's showing I received 0.48...BTC from public key 1AFDqvH..., but what is the 0.014...BTC figure? Is that the transaction fee? I didn't specify any miners fee for this transaction, does that mean it was transmitted for free? Also, what's the public key listed under "My Wallet Address"? Also, what is the number labeled as "1"? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:09:09


They've fixed it for me in the past, I'm hopeful they'll pull through this time too. The only difference this time is they haven't responded to my emails to support.
@_date: 2013-11-22 21:42:30
where do you get these stats?
@_date: 2013-06-12 01:41:26
any suggestions for the problem I'm having? 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:30:46
Yeah, the $10 s/h is kinda bs. Gyft needs to get into this market and take over. Or,  you know, have gas stations accept it directly.

The website is  which sells scientific journal articles. It's not a guy selling a book. 
The study is published in Journal of Acupuncture and Tuina Science, which is peer reviewed.
@_date: 2013-10-24 23:51:39
I would expect the same amount of bias towards acupuncture in a peer-reviewed acupuncture journal as I would towards medicine in a peer-reviewed medical journal. It's the only study I could find on the effectiveness of acupuncture on eye-twitches, positive or otherwise.

Apparently it was added the same day as Target? I heard about Target but somehow Whole Foods was skipped over. This is huge.

especially if you buy coins below the [bitpay rate]( (which is the rate gyft uses)
@_date: 2013-11-23 23:23:54
It's not the speed of the transaction that prompted me to post this, it's the lack of ANY response from support. If they had responded at all, it would've restored my faith in their service, and I wouldn't've posted this.
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:26:28
Does this mean no more Dwolla deposits to CampBX?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:30:25
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:55:08
BTC-e and Campbx are consistently (and significantly) lower. Also, at this rate, just buy them from coinbase and wait a couple days/hours.
@_date: 2013-10-21 22:03:57
you could always buy bitcoin on eBay using Paypal, the exchange rate won't be very good though.

the quickest/safest/easiest way is a paper wallet. blockchain published a simple tutorial on how to do this.

yeah, getting $ to Campbx is a pain, but I just keep a small USD balance at all times for instant BTC buys.
Personal checks aren't that much better. Sure, you don't have to buy a money order, but it takes an additional 7-10 days AFTER the check clears for it to hit your account. Where money orders take ~7 days to get to your account from when you mail it, personal checks take up to 3 weeks.
