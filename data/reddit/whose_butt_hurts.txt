The miners can't control whether or not we send them segwit transactions.  That lies completely on exchanges and wallets.  It would be like punishing them for something that is not their fault.  Or rewarding them for something they did not do themselves.

For a phone wallet: go to the app store and search for "bitcoin wallets" . You will see MYCELIUM and COINOMI as two examples. either is a decent safe choice. install it on your phone. Open the wallet. Find the "receive bitcoin" menu option. once you choose that it will show you a QR code and string of characters. these are two ways of expressing the wallet address. MYCELIUM lets you copy the characters to clipboard. then go to coinbase and use those characters as the address where you send your bitcoin. Voila, your coins are now in your wallet. YOU MUST BACKUP YOUR WALLET TO PROTECT YOUR COINS. THERE WILL BE A PROCEDURE IN THE WALLET MENU. ONCE YOU HAVE A 12 WORD SEED RECORD IT AND STORE IT IN A SAFE PLACE.  AND PROTECT YOUR WALLET WITH A PASSWORD.

The wall in this case is an order someone placed to sell 1000btc at a price of $17,250.  It's a "wall" because the price on GDAX can't go above $17250 until all those bitcoins have been sold.

a full bitcoin is practically an arbitrary amount as far as I'm concerned. after it is mined you are free to think of it as 100million sats since that's the smallest unit. but full bitcoin allows people to discuss amounts and value at a scale they prefer. it is an ongoing idea: let's use bits. let's use Mbtc. it goes on and on.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:45:20
As long as your coins are on coinbase you don't possess them.  Not your private keys, not your coins as the saying goes.  As for storage most people recommend a cold storage wallet such as trezor or ledger nano.  You can also choose a paper wallet.  Making one is simply a matter of going to bitaddress.org and following the steps on that site.  Once you have a paper wallet it contains your private keys as well as your public keys.  KNOW THE DIFFERENCE.  One lets anybody send bitcoin to your address. The other gives YOU access to the coins.  
  
I'm going to recommend you do more reading and questioning perhaps even before you go ahead and start with the wallets.  It's good to be comfortable first.

It seems to me that these statements are saying the same thing in different ways.  Maximizing security and decentralization will naturally lead to maximizing value and adoption.

The value of a currency is supposed to be attributed by the market.  It's worth what we are willing to exchange it for.  But most altcoins are partially premined and promoted before they are actually purchased and held by anyone.  They can be pump and dump schemes designed to make as much profit as possible before buyers get wise and abandon them.  The only way to get a true idea of the longterm prospects of a coin is to do research.  Who created it?  Why?  What is their stated philosophy on crypto?  Do their actions match their stated intentions?  Who is writing the code?  What do code veterans say about that code?  Is it even open source?  Those are only the questions I can think of off the top of my head.

Here's my rough knowledge...  
  
All the coin information on every bitcoin in existence lives on the blockchain.  The blockchain exists on every full node in the world.  There are therefore thousands of copies of your coins all over the world and the only way to get at them is with **your** private key. The 12 words you have allow you to recover your ownership information onto any wallet be it a hardware wallet or a smartphone wallet.  A paper wallet holds your public and private keys allowing you to transact with your coin.

It occurs to me that the market cap graph in the image shows what looks like a classic Elliot wave pattern just hitting the top of the fifth wave.  
Edit: this would suggest a likely correction to the mid 3000's over the next six months. This would be simple if not for the constantly changing conditions of supply and adoption not to mention s2x and lightning.  I can't say I believe it will correct in the classic way but it's interesting to note the wave pattern.

When a hard forkl occurs and you have old coin and the new coin, replay protection ensures that when you spend some of the new coin it does not have any effect on your old coin holdings.  With no replay protection the danger is that you could spend a s2x coin and inadvertantly cause your btc balance to go down by the same amount. Since the s2x coin might be worth much much less than the btc  this would be especially painful.  Since this danger is well known,  having no replay protection in the proposed s2x coin is seen as a deliberate attempt to do serious harm to bitcoin.

There is indeed, no need to cash out of btc unless you are in a severe crunch, like a need to pay the electric bill kind of crunch.  But it's true the total value of btc now is relatively sensitive to big buys/sells.  This sensitivity will go down as the total value of btc goes up.

I will do some speculation here so remember to do your own research and don't take everything I say as gospel.  
  
Bitcoin is not a stock for one thing.  And the gain in value is not over if it is going to do what it was designed for.  The developer designed a currency which is capable of replacing the currencies we use in our everyday lives.  It's not clear how long it will take for this 'replacement' to occur.  But while it is heading there it will achieve some truly monumental landmarks.  The current price would be peanuts compared to what btc is worth as the world reserve currency.

There are short term and long term considerations and aspirations to bitcoin. Many investors are interested in what profit they can realize from bitcoin's frequent swings. But there are also many who are interested in what it will become in 5, 10, 20 years and beyond. These are the ones who believe in the idea of btc being a better choice as a world reserve currency and holder of value. As for what backs bitcoin, there are tens of thousands of hours of work by mathematicians, cryptographers and coders who strive to make btc as strong and safe as a digital currency must be. There is the electricity and computing power that goes into the mining of each new block.

Bitcoin, if we want to get technical, exists forever on the blockchain. What we have in our hardware wallets or phone wallets or paper wallets are strings of information corresponding to information on the blockchain about specific amounts of bitcoin.   The blockchain is a permanent running record of every bitcoin from the time it is mined on forward. The blockchain exists in over a hundred thousand copies which are constantly updated according to a mathematical and cryptographic system guaranteeing accuracy and security. The code making up the blockchain has been written by a dedicated team of coders mathematicians and cryptographers who will welcome any new member willing to submit work for testing and possible acceptance.

Your perspective leaves me wanting.  
The Irish potato famine was not deliberately set in motion with the explicit goal of killing an entire population.  It was bad luck and poor sociopolitics.  The Rwanda massacre was choreographed by identifiable individuals who knew exactly how to get one group to slaughter another.

I'm starting to think of it not so much as investing but rather planting.  You plant some bitcoin seed in your wallet and let it grow.  It takes a long time and sometimes the growth seems to stop.  But remember this mighty tree has roots and while the branches might slow down the roots could be extending themselves unseen to us all.  One day it'll be big and a bird will live in it and poop on your head.

Hodler here. Yes you can't offer 100% price stability with any currency but as of 2017 that is not a compelling argument for bitcoin. Situations like the one in Venezuela are exceptional. No north American or European will ignore the fact that our fiats don't vary by even as much as 5% over many months let alone a week. Those concerned about the volatility might need to wait a few years to see for themselves how the longer term trend continues to be upward.

Because there's still fiat money to be made right now using bitcoin.  They will go where the money is.  When bitcoin becomes 'the money' that's where they will be.  
Edit:  I didn't really answer the question did I?  Okay, legacy bankers can convince the masses that bitcoin is legitimate more easily than can developers or hodlers.  When they use bitcoin, the people will assume it's real and safe.
