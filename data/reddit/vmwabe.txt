I will try read on it but my simplest question is, is the signature a function of the destination address and if it is, can a miner not modify both the destination address and signature?
@_date: 2015-08-30 12:24:17
This makes more sense than the other answers
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:00:39
Must be really brilliant if the signature prevents the destination address being altered

Bitcoin is fine, but people are holding so much, few are moving, it really is more like registered gold than easily disposable money. Am guilty of this myself, bought so many above 400 and find it hard to let go. Greed I guess.

What if its another digital crypto and its value is determined by the bitcoin it has in reserve in a single publicly known address? Bitcoin thus giving and determining its value

I hope this sliding works. Just tried it on reddit pro for android
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:58:48
Am missing something, how does the miner verify the transaction if he can not verify the private key?
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:32:53
OK thanks. Found the comment slide. Your shared knowledge is more valuable than you think.
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:12:47
Thanks. I appreciate the advice.

After reading all links on this issue it seems the security is relying on the infinite time it takes for brute forcing rather than countering the lucky episode argument. Perhaps if spending coins forced one to generate a random hash and share a public result without its key for his next spend then this window of luck would be closed. This way every spend other than the first one would require a key  of the current spend and a hash of the next one. This way even older backups of wallets would be useless if misplaced.

I understand. Let me join the community of trusting the improbability of a collision.

The abstraction could be CPU mined while the standard publicly traded like the assets and stock of a plc
@_date: 2015-07-26 00:13:38
You are right. Thanks for the links too.
@_date: 2015-07-26 12:34:18
I did not think that my friend. I actually appreciate correction more than agreement.

Yes I meant C . two unique random keys whose hex produces the same public key. Since theoretically its possible, does the network prevent one of the users from spending? Asking another way, if one generates a new address but after syncing realizes there are bitcoin inputs it, does the network prevent spending them?

Am doing that now from the reddit website. I was trying from the android app and its difficult to serialize the responses in it. I apologize for causing you any difficulty.

Bitcoin could save Africa if we, Africans, adopt it as a reserve currency, freeing us from the shackles of the Fed  and inflation on world bank loans. As it is now, we get loans in dollars then our currencies get devalued then we repay with compound interest. Perennial poverty.

i found out my problem, the api is blocking devices that are making queries through TOR

Mpesa is centralized and run by one mobile network which is half owned by the government. Laws are manipulated in its monopolistic favour. One is limited to $700 transfer a day and $1400 balance. It is reversible hence not easily accepted as cash amongst strangers or late at night, it gives loans (virtual money) and collects interest (real money). It is nothing like bitcoin. And when the server is under maintenance, the ecosystem freezes.
@_date: 2015-11-13 09:36:21
Yes, its working, just one of my connections was through TOR

I have finally studied pgp and understood this concept. Its amazing.
