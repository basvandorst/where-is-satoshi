You could sum it up by saying psychopaths.
And I don't mean the Norman Bates, Jason Voorhees type but the text book definition type...

Yah the Bolivar isn’t a major currency though.
The dollar is and it’s propped up by massive debt. I could see a dollar crash kicking off a chain reaction that would send people running to something outside the fiat system. That leaves precious metals and crypto.
I HOPE that doesn’t happen but it’s not out of the question.

This process assumes some pretty weighty things...
1. That the crypto community would stand idly by and allow BTC to be annexed and corrupted by the central banks any more than the central banks are standing idly by waiting for BTC to replace fiat. There are far too many players with far too much fiat tied up in BTC that there wouldn't be push back. That pushback would be very public and people who know nothing about crypto, but who already hate the banking cartel, would also get involved and bad press, civil unrest, etc, etc...
2.  That there would be a point in turning crypto into the same puppet show mess that fiat already is. The dollar is already effectively a digital currency. Why scrap it and all the supporting infrastructure to turn around and build the same thing slightly different. The effects of that changeover alone would be similar to the kind of structural collapse that would be necessary for BTC to actually replace the dollar. The logistics would be a nightmare...
3. That there's not more room for the banking cartels to make money participating than annexing. The cap on BTC vs fiat makes for some staggering sums of money for those in a position to convert billions/trillions in fiat to BTC. And they would essentially have to do nothing but click a few buttons and wait. (The fuckery comes later and doesn't involve crypto manipulation in that direct a fashion)
4. That the concept of banking that has stood for thousands of years hasn't run its course and reached its end of life and that the banking cartels aren't involved in the creation of BTC in the first place with it replacing fiat as the intended goal. Who really cares how many people get Lambos when you are buying mining rights for sectors of asteroid belts or planets one day?
5. That the anonymous nature of crypto isn't more useful to the banks than to individuals. Again, who cares who is buying an 8 ball of heroine with BTC online, untraceable, when you are able to stand up whole armies and fight wars without anyone knowing you paid for it?
There's far more for banks to lose in fucking with crypto than in embracing it and using it to their advantage. For sure the average person will be just as fucked as they were before, maybe even moreso. But those brave/crazy/stupid few who get their boat in the water early will rise with the tide of whales and leviathans.

Agreed. I make good money and I will never realistically be able to retire unless something dramatic happens.
The cost of living outpaced our ability to keep up some time ago. And I don't mean the cost of a gallon of milk or gas. I mean the cost of a place to live, food, and health care, especially in old age.
I could pay off my house, save for monthly expenses for my realistic life span, and still get taken out by a single medical incident. And there are likely to be several, between my wife and I.
