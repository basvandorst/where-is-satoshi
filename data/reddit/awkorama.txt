Well Linux was made in 90's, it didn't exists in the 80's. Also Linux has no user interface, since it is just a kernel, the userspace is always provided by something on top of linux, be it gnome, kde, android, smart tv interface etc etc.

I don't think that pools really control all the hashpower that we attribute to them. I mean, GHash.IO can just as well have 70% of the hashpower as long as they play by the rules. If they start doing something fishy, the miners can leave afterwards (or other pool operators may choose to ignore blocks mined by GHash.IO etc.) However I don't think that the pool should be punished when it means no harm and is just successful.

The problem with moving funds (and especially fiat) is the major one when doing arbitrage. Even if you wanted to do arbitrage on two exchanges you would need at least 1000USD in fiat on both of these exchanges ready to trade. After some time you would also need to rebalance (move fiat from one exchange to another).
That also means that you have to have it stored on the exchange and trust the exchange not to disappear overnight (with all the fiat money that you transfered there).

This site doesn't actually allow you to trade any currency pair that includes bitcoin. I downloaded the demo and it doesn't have any BTCUSD currency pair. So I suppose you have your account in bitcoin and when you do a (leveraged) EURUSD trade you go long and short for EURBTC,EURUSD.
TL;DR This does not allow you to trade leveraged bitcoins.

OK guys, just woke up to this news after a hard night of pushing the BTC price. So... Can anyone explain how this will affect people outside US? (both de jure and de facto)
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:06:39
well it isn't now for old, so I am curious, how they will implement it. I still think Electrum is the best wallet for me.
@_date: 2013-02-19 16:09:49


Why do you think so? Connectivity is as scarce as hashing power, I see no difference between the two from economical perspective (e.g. more connectivity/hashing power costs more).

Using that logic, lawmakers can just ban the whole Bitcoin.

Actually I don't agree with the gun lobby parable. The thing is, I personally do not believe that guns can bring much "good" to the society, while cars or bitcoin can (as well as evil, but then it's up to the people).
I agree with your second point.
@_date: 2013-03-17 06:34:54
Isn't this essentially a hard fork? After 15th of May, old clients (0.7.x and older) that wouldn't have their BDB reconfigured would stop working with what is considered the official reference implementation.

It is supposed to be better, because instead of generating a sequence of keys, it produces a tree, so getting to n-th key takes only log n operations, instead of n.
@_date: 2013-02-20 16:34:19
Isn't it the same with any technological advancement? For example cars. People would have said: How can we let people have cars, they would be able to rob banks and getaway fast by using cars. Also all the horse breeders will be out of jobs etc etc.
If something (in this case bitcoin) is genuinely superior to other currencies/transaction systems, it will prevail, there is nothing to stop it.

I am actually not happy about this release at all. In order to support old electrum deterministic wallets and BIP32, electrum 1.9 only support the restore operation while online. What this essentially means is if all your backups fails and you only have the seed with which you generated your wallet, you have to type that seed into an online computer, making it a hot wallet. I guess I will be stuck to version 1.8.1 for a long time now.

Done with what?

I am not sure whether this is legal by European laws, at least for [eu citizens](
If I understand the article correctly, they would have to have a commercial reason to not open an account for you (not just based on nationality/residency).
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:01:08
I use blockchain.info just as my day to day wallet. 
For long term storage I use offline Electrum, which means that electrum is installed on my online computer and also on an offline computer that stores the seed on an encrypted hard drive. I also memorized the seed if the offline host's hard drive fails etc. PM me if you need help creating such setup.
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:17:05
i use an old netbook and it isn't snip snap really, takes a little time when signing transactions, nothing major, but it will only get worse as i start using addresses with higher indices.
@_date: 2013-11-05 10:28:39
No, the problem stays the same for 1.9 (bip32) wallets, they can not be recovered offline.
@_date: 2013-02-20 22:52:42
Also don't forget the other side of the scale:
1000 = 1 kilobit(coin)
1000000 = 1 megabit(coin)
100... oh wait, nevermind..
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:53:19


This is false. You can create a new transaction that includes a fee and effectively double spend the money, and the new transaction will go into the blockchain.
The other possibility (I am not 100% sure about this) is if A sends money to B without fee and B sends money to C with fee, both transactions will be included into the block, the miners would like to get the fee from B-&gt;C transaction, but in order to get them, they need to include the free A-&gt;B transaction.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:48:11
Which exchange is this from ?
@_date: 2013-11-05 18:55:21
1.8.1 will generate 10 or so addresses when restoring the wallet offline (that depends on specified gap limit). However the offline wallet is able to sign transactions even for other addresses that belong to that seed.
@_date: 2013-03-31 07:13:18
how is this a difficult task? blockchain.info MyWallet already includes a possibility to send btc by email, surely sending it using facebook message is no great difference.
@_date: 2013-03-28 09:55:35
I think the correct approach here is the Electrum deterministic wallet with seed. What it basically does is it generates 128-bit seed that can generate an endless list of addresses. Then it converts this seed to a mnemonic, which is 12 words long. You memorize these 12 words. The dictionary attack in this case is 2^128, so good luck with that. Also memorizing 12 words is not that hard.
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:12:16
I would gladly buy one and install it, so if someone is selling an ATM at a reasonable price, PM me.
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:59:03
When typing passphrases into an online computer, there is significantly higher risk of the passphrase being stolen (because of virus etc. etc.) Older versions of electrum supported offline restore, 1.9 does not.
@_date: 2013-03-31 07:04:19
using raw tx, yes
@_date: 2013-11-05 15:55:05
I don't need to see the transactions, I just need to sign them, which can be done offline. There is a command switch for 1.8.1, that will allow offline restore. Then a seedless online wallet can create a transaction that this offline wallet will be able to sign.

From my understanding spending the btc would be free from income tax.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:45:22
this must be a joke, right ?
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:37:09
That was the original idea, they just pulled bip32 out of 1.9 release.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:07:04
You can, I just tried it on both 1.8.1 and 1.9, using command ./electrum -o restore . On 1.8.1 it works fine, on 1.9 it is stuck on "Recovering wallet..." message.
@_date: 2013-09-11 10:02:13
I understand this is pretty cool for storage of BTC's however, how does one spend them? I mean scanning a private key on an online pc will always be a security problem, right? So this doesn't really eliminate a need for airtight pc for secure transaction signing, right?
@_date: 2013-02-20 10:21:23
Correct me if I am wrong, but if there was no hard limit on block size, but majority of miners would agree on a soft limit, then if some miner decides to ignore the soft limit, he would still validate a block etc, but his large block will surely be orphaned, because all the other miners would refuse to include his block in the chain they are mining. This limit can have various manifestations (absolute block size, minimum average fee per kB, minimum average fee per BTC in transaction etc etc.).
If somebody is spamming transactions, it is his free will to do so. It is also a free will of the miner to include that transaction in a block.

Bitcoinity doesn't have the indicators that I am looking for, it's basically just price action + order book visualization.
@_date: 2013-03-30 10:06:19
1. yes, the seed is all that matters
2. it has 2^128 possible combinations.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:40:16
I wonder how they will support it once both old algorithm and bip32 will be present there, i guess i will also have to specify, that i want to restore "old" or "bip32" wallet, and then enter the seed. Looking forward to next version then :)
@_date: 2013-03-06 23:14:06
The thing about all these success stories is (in general) they are upgrade-able. All of them are getting new features, bugs fixed etc. Bitcoin on the other hand cannot be just "upgraded". Some of the changes are not backward compatible with existing clients and miners and many of these are viewed as strongly political (the block size limit is a great example). Because of this Bitcoin is hard to change and might be overtaken by something very similar, just a little better in certain aspects. But I agree that the first mover advantage and network effect do help Bitcoin big time.
@_date: 2013-03-29 19:34:28
The easy answer to this is, do not generate the passphrase yourself, use [diceware]( or something similar.

When sending the money from the wallet, you need to sign it by private key. This needs to be done by a computer (manually signing it would be a cumbersome process) and if that computer is online that poses a security risk.
@_date: 2013-03-10 07:14:35
It supports electrum seeding, so 12 word passphrase is the only thing you need to backup somewhere.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:50:03
The private key is needed to spend the money on the address, yes. There are multiple ways to do that, you don't need to type it into an exchange.
Regarding the amount to keep in individual addresses, that's entirely up to you, but you can always create a new paper wallet, and when spending the first one, send all the change to the new one, that way, you always keep only a single wallet (the old one would be empty after the transaction).
@_date: 2013-03-22 09:05:53
The problem with exchange traded futures is, that exchange should guarantee you the payout even if the other side of the trade fails to pay. That's what margin etc. is for, but in bitcoin world it doesn't seem to be enough, since you can always start a new online identity and keep on scamming. Anonymity doesn't really go well with futures/options marketplace. Obviously OTC is even riskier.
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:33:40
Correct me if I am wrong but isn't this essentially all about coloured bitcoins? Coloured bitcoins have always been viewed as a possibility to trade other securities over the bitcoin protocol etc. This is all essentially about some US companies saying, that they don't accept bitcoins anymore, they only accept a subset of coins, not all of them, e.g. only a specific colour(s). 
Regard privacy breach etc. In my opinion this is nothing new, I am sure any online shop or exchange accepting bitcoin now stores a link between the incoming transaction (someone paying for goods) and an user account in their db (which may include real name and address, if it is a delivery service). These bitcoin food delivery services, they know where the owner of that particular bitcoin address lives, and if they scan the blockchain, they can then find out what he did with the change money, for example gambled it at satoshidice and won 10k BTC. This is certain form of privacy breach, but it isn't anything new.

Your block was orphaned by majority of miners, not directly by developers. Anyway, sorry for your loss, I hope that the mining process cares about karma so you will get you money back.
