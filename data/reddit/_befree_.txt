I’m in at $900 so I have a long way to go before I lose money. I’m torn between take profit and double down.

Right. Corporations lobby the state to grant them monopolies or to enforce regulations that hurt their competition. 
ACTUAL capitalism would require these corporations to serve the people instead of the state.

You obviously don’t know much about the bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:52:02
Crimes damage people or this property.
Am I criminal if I sell you a rope and you hand yourself with it? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:05:24
Why do you think that? You realize bitcoin is revolutionary in the sense that it’s virtually immune to the government? 
Again, some aren’t in it for the money. It has other value to them such as, resistance to confiscation, anti inflation, permission-less, anonymous, etc. These remain true regardless of the price.

Without lube.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:54:03
No doubt your right about that. But the point I want to make is real bitcoin people are in it for freedom and tech. The price only matters to people trying to profit off it (probably most people). “Real bitcoin people” would rather it go to 0 than have its ideals damaged by the government.

People can’t be trusted to manage their own money so we have to rely on people (who can’t be trusted) to manage our money for us...

“Move somewhere that also has taxes and oppressive laws.”
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:21:59
Wow where to even begin. Please show me when exactly I agreed to all that. 
Please understand how difficult it is to renounce citizenship and once you do, tell me I’m still free to leave. 
And no I do not want to reap the benefits provided by theft. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:50:22
You sure make hyperbolic statements seem sincere. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:40:50
Keeping what I earn instead of giving it to our overlords who then use it to oppress is theft? Thieving is the moral thing to do, in this case. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:18:24
It can be done. When I was a full time student I had a work study job and also a full time overnight job that gave me plenty of overtime. After 4 years i had close to $40k. 
I burned myself out and didn’t have much fun but here I am, 24 Year’s old and debt free. 
Edit: I was poor as fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:21:48
Taxation is theft. Sorry pal. The government can blow me. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:52:56
The only words I read from that tweet is bitcoin facilitate trade.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:42:57
Thanks I really needed it! Too many downvotes from trolling pro socialist pages. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:12:34
Oh what would I ever do without the FDA letting E. coil fester at chipotle while also enforcing regulations that prevent competition from preparing safer food. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:26:18
You can count time. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:50:32
Enforceable contracts require mutual consent. Please show me my signature on said social contract. 
Please show me a forest where I can reside freely. I think you’ll find our overlords would lock me up for that. But nice try, commie. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:26:05
Right? I wish I could actually spend it on something.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:39:38
Touché. It was just your average business degree. And I didn’t buy crypto until after graduating, although I vaguely remember wishing I had the money to buy some at the time. 
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:20:10
Do you feel like a criminal? Or do you feel as if you were doing something perfectly moral that just happens to be illegal? Do you feel guilt or remorse? 
I personally think it’s absurd that we lock people in cages for selling products to willing customers. I may be a radical, but I see you as a victim of an oppressive trash government.
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:45:16
What exactly did you do that was ethically wrong?
@_date: 2018-10-10 00:53:36
Lmao state coins 
@_date: 2019-11-23 21:06:47
No one listen to this morn. No one know what bitcoin will do.
@_date: 2019-10-08 01:24:17
Then you happily accept USD, at a 100% mark up.
@_date: 2019-06-21 00:29:40
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:30:23
I think I should probably do the same! Is this something support was able to help you with? 
I think it would be reaching for straws in my case since I'll never remember the email I used at the time. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:27:32
Ugh. I vaguely remember sitting in my high school classroom, bored, solving captchas for BTC. 
The problem, I don't remember which wallet I used, and even if I could I'll never recall the email address I used. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:03:45
Got 1 full bitcoin and I never plan on selling. Not will I buy anymore. I'm in at around 4K 
@_date: 2017-10-26 14:46:52
Awful lot of statists in here. *sigh*
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:18:05
I’m leaving this shit hole state in March and I couldn’t be happier. 
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:25:36
Does anyone know where we are on the macafee dick line?!
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:46:19
Yang is probably richer than anyone actually  knows because of bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:04:45
As a radical libertarian this brings warmth to my heart. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 19:03:16
Christmas miracle :)
