Wall Street’s top regulator on Thursday all but shut the door to approving exchange-traded funds that hold bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, questioning whether the products could comply with rules meant to protect mom-and-pop investors.
The Securities and Exchange Commission outlined its views in a letter to two Wall Street trade groups whose members envision the profits that could flow from selling exposure to bitcoin through popular investment vehicles such as ETFs and mutual funds. The SEC questioned how bitcoin’s volatility and potential illiquidity would fit with funds that must calculate a fair market price for their portfolio at the end of every trading day and allow investors to easily cash out their shares.
“Until the questions identified above can be addressed satisfactorily, we do not believe that it is appropriate for fund sponsors to initiate registration of funds that intend to invest substantially in cryptocurrency and related products,” the SEC’s director of investment management, Dalia Blass, wrote in the letter made public Thursday.
Several ETF issuers have been racing to launch the first bitcoin fund amid a speculative frenzy for digital currencies, but the SEC has so far been skeptical. The agency has also expressed reservations about initial coin offerings, saying that many ICOs, in which a firm raises money from investors in exchange for a new coin, are securities sales that should comply with its investor protection rules.
Last year, the SEC rejected two proposed ETFs that would directly own bitcoin, including one from Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, arguing that the global market for the digital currency wasn’t transparent enough to support sufficient oversight.
Some fund companies hoped that the SEC might relent after two Chicago exchanges late last year launched futures contracts on bitcoin. Those contracts are regulated by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a smaller federal agency whose rules allow Wall Street to more easily market new products.
The SEC’s order in the Winklevoss case in March had indicated that a liquid and regulated futures contract could strengthen the case to allow bitcoin ETFs. But under its new chairman, Jay Clayton, the SEC has taken a more hawkish stance toward products and conduct that could blow up and hurt retail investors. Wall Street’s hopes for the SEC’s approval were dashed last week when the regulator asked several firms to withdraw applications to launch ETFs backed by bitcoin futures.
Bitcoin vs. Regulators: Who Will Win?
As bitcoin has emerged from the underground world of nerds and criminals to become a mainstream investment, the risk of hacks and scandals has also blossomed. What's a government to do?

The SEC’s letter outlined a series of questions that ETF and mutual-fund sponsors would need to answer to get the agency’s blessing in the future for crypto funds. But it warned them not to look for loopholes that could allow them to offer new funds that track bitcoin or bitcoin futures. U.S. law allows mutual-fund companies with existing regulatory approvals to introduce new funds with minimal oversight, but the SEC warned it wouldn’t be pleased if that avenue was tried to launch bitcoin ETFs.
“We would view that action unfavorably and would consider actions necessary or appropriate to protect Main Street investors, including recommending a stop order to the commission,” Ms. Blass wrote.

The block reward is 12.5 Bitcoins. The fees do offset the cost of hardware and power. There are various mining profitability calculators out there. The short answer is that unless you own the factory making the equipment and that you own the power, it is not profitable to mine.


The fees + block rewards make it profitable so long as you own the entire infrastructure for it


Your computer can be a node to relay transactions. However there is no compensation for that. Also, unless you are willing to invest millions, it is more cost effective to take those millions and buy Bitcoins.

Really odd that he selects the two quotes that he did out of everything that the media has said about Bitcoin in the past week. I mean here's this guy (that should be fired) from Huffpo comparing [Bitcoins to the Republican Tax Cuts]( 
Along with Roger Ver and all the Brokerages refusing to list XBT...What the hell is this guy trying to say? That the public thinks Bitcoin will rise and so that it will fall or that the public thinks that the Media says Bitcoin is dead and it will rise?
Even looking to his own examples doesn't say clearly either. For every bearish article there's a bullish one about any stock or bond. In that sector, the media shotguns news articles and just keep the ones that stick live and they kill other ones just as fast.
I can't tell you how many times I've seen the market open high and then I'll see "Market is up because of The President's speech" and when it craters 5 minutes later because of something new, they will delete the article that they had just posted and put up a new one "Market is down because of fears about China" or some crap.

These same people say [Trust us with your money]( and they make &gt; 30% or more on the money in [hedge funds]( such as JP Morgan and other holdings, while giving you +5% a year on average if you're lucky. 
On top of that, they vote in [Donald Trump]( and give themselves [1.5 Trillion]( while murdering our children by [killing CHIP](

The Global Recession would happen because of the existing fiat hacks. Fiat has been hacked such that the global elite can extract value from it. The problem is that they have extracted too much value from it. The various systems are already teetering on collapse. The very next (and possibly last) "patch" that they can do is UBI. UBI does fix a part of the problem with the overall Keynesian economics. However, the fiat currency is still hacked -- they can print more, they shift the tax responsibility to the working population and they own the governments and banks and continue to do rent seeking. So...the problem remains -- what do 6.9 billion people do when they're not working and not needed for work.

I see SpaceX internet constellation as more useful than this ... With that constellation, you can setup bitcoin miners anywhere.

Just curious - why is a Windows Azure server a requirement? Why not use Azure Container Instances? The costs would be far lower...

Here's the deal. The only way that Bitcoin is going to "die" is if the cryptographic proof is somehow destroyed by a modern algorithm. If that happens, we've got much, much, much bigger problems as that modern algorithm could then destroy any encrypted secret.   
Other than that, there is no real way to destroy Bitcoin.

Someone tell this guy about it ...

I hope that we can get consultants to start accepting Bitcoin again using Koinex! Unocoin has their issues so maybe we should try Koinex.

I posed this very question five years ago to the developers. This is a math question. Five years ago, the developers had already baked in quantum resistance to various components of the bitcoin algorithm and...it's only been hardened since.
About the only unlikely possibility is that somehow a quantum computer magically discovers an undiscovered back door to the encryption behind bitcoin.
The bitcoin algorithm has already been 'under attack' since it was created and with millions of combined computing years of attacks, nothing has been discovered.
Even some of the brightest minds of our foreign adversaries have examined the code and found no flaws.
The core bitcoin code is perhaps some of the most perfect code ever created by man. If anything, a quantum computer will only verify this. I, for one, welcome the attacks by a Google Supremacy.

I meant to explain that the use case for multi-sig goes beyond institutions not to complain about the Trezor. I've since edited my post. Kindly remove the down vote.

Bitcoin is not an Exchange. You can earn Bitcoin directly and you can do business with anyone that wants to accept Bitcoins directly. If someone does not want to accept your Bitcoins that is their choice. 
If I do not want to accept Bitcoins from the hacker that hacked Binance, that is my choice. Everyone is truly free in this case.

Really old news from Forbes. It's like they're not even trying anymore.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:55:55
Plenty of use cases for multi-sig. Large asset escrow. Corporations and non-profits wallet control. Even clubs / treasury management. The Ledger Vault and the Trezor can operate in environments with two or more parties in control over the wallet.

Look at the shitcoin USD and it's trillion dollar loss. The USD is dead. The USD is a gambling device. The USD is unreliable and susceptible to fraud. The USD has no utility. The USD is broken. The best thing to do with the USD? burn it with fire. Nobody learned their lesson after the last crash. The USD is nothing more than bovine excrement.
@_date: 2019-05-16 15:36:00
Yes. Several other news outlets have already published a whole thing about this long before Forbes finally decided to write about it.
So much time has passed that even Ron Paul had a chance to make insults about it.

TL;DR No it is not.
