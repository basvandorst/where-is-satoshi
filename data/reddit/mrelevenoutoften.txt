99% chance they fuck it up. You'd think the cunts have Brexit to keep them busy
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:11:54
erm why the dump? it was north of 7k last time I checked yesterday
@_date: 2018-08-30 15:22:22
and when it fails the failure will be attributed to crypto; great!

of course it does
being able to see every transaction made is every government's wet dream. And they avoided the backlash if they had tried to do it themselves. In my opinion that's the real reason behind this change in tact, they understood the blockchain and how it can help them

just as blockchain analysis is getting better year on year. No doubt it will turn into some form of arms race but notice how the noise is already shifting towards privacy coins and features. For example coinbase will only be allowing transparent addresses for Zcash. Which for me personally takes away the USP of ZEC.
I wouldn't be entirely suprised if some bigger exchanges begin to remove privacy coins in the next few years under regulatory pressure. Not something that I would like to see but I try to be as realistic as possible when it comes to what I invest in

lol yeah the more you zoom out the better it looks. Cos all charts under this timeframe look bad
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:09:46
do not fight the market trend
furthermore we had one of the greatest bull events last year. To think we can "combat" the bears is laughable, this is just the next part of the cycle before we see another bull run. Reduce your exposure and look for underrated low cap gems. Topia has thrown up some fantastic buys for me the last 6 weeks
@_date: 2018-10-14 05:32:03
what is this illustrating?
@_date: 2018-10-29 00:26:26
move the O.G bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 13:35:38
@_date: 2018-10-29 12:17:12
Oh, TIL. How come they can't be moved? Second part of your statement is very true.

comparing macroeconomics and microeconomics or likening a countries finances to household finances is stupid as fuck. That's how the public swallowed austerity in my country

i find him quite annoying and he exagerrates a lot but he has also pointed out some glaring flaws in crypto that others seem happy to ignore

lol welcome to this sub mate

imagine you bought at 20k ON CREDIT. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:55:52
because nobody is really about tech anymore. Everybody wants to get rich.
A shame how a few years ago anti\-bank rebellious BTC now has coiners begging for institutional money to enter the very people they claim they dislike
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:24:22
Think the aim was to address the banking issues some dispensaries were having with banking

As someone who had fuck loads of BTC back then. None of us knew this would happen. I'd met 100s of people before the initial explosion to 1k USD and only 2 of those people ever spoke of 5 figures.
These posts are no different to posting up lottery numbers after the fact
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:21:14
well we have triple bottomed but volume is so lacklustre i personally wouldn't
but TA doesn't work remember ;)
@_date: 2019-02-10 08:37:15
i once put 25 quid worth into bitpay to buy a video game back in 2012/2013. Cannot remember why but I didn't end up using Bitpay to buy it in the end and must have forgotten about it. Bitpay emailed me because they were closing accounts and I found that forgotten amount of coin was worth 4 figures in 2017. 
Very little downside and a lot of upside.

well speculation i suppose. Whenever Dennis Rodman goes to N.Korea it pumps like clockwork
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:24:40
and potcoin volume up over 200&amp;
this \+ canadian law change = bullish af on cannabis coins
@_date: 2019-12-20 09:49:39
but will the masses care about that though? people will be far more likely to use digital currencies released by their trusted central banks than some anonymous person
@_date: 2019-12-20 10:42:24
i guess we see things from different perspectives. From mine people are far more trusting of fiat BECAUSE it is controlled, the vast majority of people just don't give a fuck about these things they value convenience more than anything and feel a sense of security that there is somebody to go to if it all goes pear shaped.

sell for spot? not bad where is it?
@_date: 2019-01-18 13:02:46
I wonder how many people have been put off by this. As if BTC is not confusing enough to the average joe already
@_date: 2019-01-26 04:21:20
next halving not far off though...
@_date: 2019-01-27 00:55:27
I don't even own a whole bitcoin anymore I don't need saving lol

the stupid cunt nearly let a whole gang of child rapists walk free cos he nearly jeopardized the case for his own sense of involvement. The guy is a self obsessed piece of shit bigot enabler. Are you even from England? Seems to be a load of Americans obsessing about him for some reason 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:25:20
oversold? that sounds like TA talk take it to r/bitcoinmarkets. Only memes and photos of ATMs around here boy
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:48:32
yes...which you can do on localbitcoins. It has various different methods of payments one of which is meet in person
@_date: 2018-07-26 22:51:30
the cboe decision (the more important one) has not been decided.
hence the meagre drop (thus far)
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:30:59
this is what people were saying last time and the time before that...
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:57:43
so localbitcoins?
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:31:31
should have retired
@_date: 2019-05-22 00:27:06
surprised we haven't seen a double digit % dump
@_date: 2018-12-20 18:00:22
what do they gain from this?
@_date: 2018-12-18 23:55:14
turned to wex and then exit scammed. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 00:09:19
yeah very strange going ons over there. They said they were going down for server maintenance which likely prompted a lot of people to withdraw their assets but when they came back you could only withdraw NMC, PPC AND ZEC. Even stranger they then added XMR as well as a stop loss feature but most withdrawals were disabled. Then a few weeks back I checked the url and it was gone. Very strange way to conduct an exit scam
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:56:42
been here since 2011 and i'm still concerned. If anything this shows we have a lot more potential downside than most people realise
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:11:58
Christmas day = lower activity. Expect us to be above 4k by the 27th.
@_date: 2018-12-23 17:56:07
it'll overcharge you. There are cheaper and as simple methods
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:12:35
waiting for the inevitable pullback personally
2017 was filled with some of the biggest retractions and this time will be no different.
