This is indeed an ideal to aim for. But in practice, I think a imperfect near-term solution is still better than the current system. At least that is how I'm feeling right now.

I don't believe so but I would have to check.

lol, this is really dumb imo. Normal people would only care about bitcoins dollar value. People can still forget about 0.002 btc even now. 
If you own any significant amount say 10k, there is no way you would just forget about it.
As that friend of you to “ forget” it again for another 5 years to see if he can do it.

LOL, no one knows what they are talking about so let me explain. Order books are limit orders sitting there passively to be executed. In a simplified world, if everyone is being patient and not moving at all. Price will be stuck and nothing would happen.
When price is going up with pace, limit sell orders are executed because people who are willing to accept what is being offered. When the price ticks upward, the selling orders are bought so they are gone. Since the old sell orders are gone, offering orders become bidding orders. Because those were newly placed orders, which only are placed there AFTER the sell orders are gone, it is super normal to see this type of order books.  
On top of that, a lot of those orders are market making orders run by algorithms. I wouldn’t look at those as any indication of the price movements. It’s better to just look at how the price react to dumping to see the true strength of buying and selling.
