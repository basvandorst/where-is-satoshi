Wrong. My wage is already taxed BEFORE I receive it in BTC. Double taxation is a fucking theft!  
This BS article is just a shill for a "crypto tax software" to make you guilty that you are not using it for paying taxes. The main goal of these software is to **collect data from users** so LE can just sit and receive it. You are giving them your privacy and freedom.

Just use Bitwage.com - be paid by your employer as usual and get BTC straight to your BTC wallet.  
Also Bisq.network is great, P2P decentralized exchange, escrow, no KYC, bank/SEPA.  
hodlhodl.com also is a good one.  
Other solutions: Trastra, Bitwala, Revolut (they give you an IBAN and you can have a crypto account). But with these there is too much KYC... I don't like them at all.

No backup instructions. Losing funds is reckless.  
I love LN, but why we are trying to push this nodes and stuff, **if there is no full way to backup your nodes and secure your funds**?  
Just take this example:  
- a merchant see this guide, start building it  
- start taking payments in his shop with LN  
- one day the machine can just die, maybe in a middle of a payment  
1. How he can restore that machine in few minutes or hours?  
2. How can restore his funds and continue to receive payments?  
I raised some question here  - in 24h there were NO answer. NONE.  
These important issues are NOT told anywhere in all these github documentations. NONE.  
So please if you start proposing a solution, propose also how to keep alive that solution.  
**We are talking about money here**.  
When we recommend to use LN, we should warn all the users: **there is no good solution to backup/secure your funds, use it as experimental mode until further developments.**  
That's why more and more people are pushed to fucking custodial solutions and that is really shit.  
But why we should care about important things? Let's go to creating funny memes, it's all what we can do, no?

Damn... seems that you do not understand the problem here:  
**BOTH servers are using the same port, otherwise cannot operate their apps**.  
Server 1 - has 80 and 443 already used for a website  
Server 2 (btcpay) needs to use 80 and 443 to communicate with the Server1 to be able to redirect the payments to btcpay page.  
Port 80 is meaningless for payments. Is not used and SHOULD not be used.
From outside:  
The webshop is running on   
The btcpay server is running on btcpay.yourdomain.com:443  
Your router **do not know** how to route port 443 to 2 different internal IPs.  
So, BTCpay server box should be able to work on another port like 8443. And I couldn't find that how to do it.

Try looking into steganography (hiding secret messages/seed into a picture).  is working great.  
[An example here](  
Having a picture file containing a seed /parts of it, could be an easy and ingenious way to keep safe a HODL wallet. You can even post that picture online somewhere, in many places for redundant recovery and NOBODY will know about it.  
You can even memorize you seed for a "buffer" wallet. It's easy to train your brain for that. Example: [use a TailsOS USB with Electrum already installed]( wallet, just boot up with that USB, on any computer, put your memorized seed and voila, you have access anywhere to your wallet, without need of any HW.
@_date: 2019-03-25 16:33:20
But it's a stupid useless scam. If CSW would acquire such address/wallet and use it to prove his ownership, also the original owner could do the same and will debunk his scam.  
So you have to be a real idiot to use a bought wallet as proof of ownership.

Why you have use HW as a spending source of your BTC?   
If you spread in 3 types of wallets your BTC stash you don't need a HW to spend from.  
**HODL wallet** (large amounts) - a wallet that you only deposit, never spend from, no need to open/access it. You could use a watch only wallet for that or a simple check on any blockexplorer will show you your "balances".  
**Medium/buffer** - a wallet for medium amounts, just IN/OUT buy/sell, coin control, CoinJoin, spreading/spliting to different wallets. Example: buy from an exchange, coinjoin it, and split it into HODL, medium, small wallets.  
**Small/mobile wallets** - day to day use of BTC, not important amounts, normal onchain or LN wallets. even if you lose them or get robbed are not an important lose for you.  
All these 3 types of wallets could be easily managed without any "hardware wallet" to store your seed/keys/access. The simple seed could be kept safe in many different ways: paper, steel, encrypted file on encrypted USB, **steganography** embedding seed into a picture, hiding in plain sight into a text or story, paintings or whatever any curious way. All these has the same security level as a HW or maybe even better because also can contain the "anti-5bucks-wrench-attack" protection named **plausible deniability**.

All this hype around galaxy S10 is a fabricated "need for security" so they can sell more smartphones. That's it.  
If you keep safe your seed and that seed was created in the right conditions, you are just fine.  
I am even memorizing a seed and use it exactly like a password. No need for fancy hardware wallets that sell a false need of security.  
If you want more security, use steganography and hide in plain sight your seed. Zero cost!  
Walking around with a phone S10, everybody will know that you are carrying shitloads of BTC. And who knows, maybe someday you will get wrench into your head... for nothing.  
Keeping a low profile is the best way to hide your BTC.

BTCPay will use ports 80 and 443. If you have another machines in the same network using those ports your BTCPay server will be non-functional.  
If BTCPay will have in the future the ability to choose the ports during the setup, then maybe will be a complete solution.  
Right now BTCPay is good to be the ONLY machine that handle your webshop. Also I couldn't find a way to have 1 BTCPay server for various webshops, even on the same machine.  
Maybe future developments will give this ability through the same BTCPay interface management and user do not have to dig into linux machine.  
Remember this is supposed to be a easy tool foe merchants, they install it, setup and personalize their shop into a nice web interface and done, ready to go.

Docker pack of btcpay comes with nginx that take care of all https communication and certs. I tried to edit the yml file of nginx but still it didn't start on another port. Goes back to 443.  
I followed this guide:   
I think that the setup once is done, is writing somewhere that port and you can't change it. it would be nice to have a port selection BEFORE running the setup in those preparations with "export".  
This method with docker works flawlessly, but is created for the case when you use ONLY 1 machine in the same LAN.  
Also I don't know if is possible to have on the same BTCPay machine, **more than one webshop** with Woo, or to be able to serve another webshop.

@_date: 2019-03-30 19:55:31
BTCpay **could not** finish the setup if you can't open it on port 443. I can open it on port 80, but when I go to setup the features it says, must be used on port 443.  
When a customer click to pay, it redirects to btcpay server at the FQDN that was set in setup phase and created the certificates for it. So if your btcpay.domain.com is not responding on 443, the payment **could not be done.**  
On the same machine of btcpay, I can open the server page on port 80 but NOT on port 443. Not even locally. It gives nginx error 500 Internal server error. That means, the browser send the request using the certificate, outside in internet, then came back and gives the error because the port 443 is used by another machine in the network.  Of course nginx send error 500 because do not receive an answer...  So I cannot continue the setup.  


Not with docker.

There are more lessons here to learn:  
1. Never sell your BTC. Just HODL it  
2. Never buy a ring to a girl, in special with your BTC  
3. Never use Conbase, in special if is "recommended" by a YT video or a "friend" by sending you a link.  
Now you are a total loser:  
- she dump you, because this is life, if you can't give her a ring, she will say "I will go with the guy that still HODL his BTC". Karma is a bitch, but girls are bitcher than karma.

Maybe you should add more details about merchants like if they use a 3rd party or self hosted. I would NEVER consider a Bitcoin merchant the one that uses Conbase or Bitpay.  
I see many webshops that have on the bottom of the page the links to "Privacy policy". **But none of them insert there a mention: if you use Bitcoin your user info will not be shared, tracked, registered etc but if you use VISA your data slip from our hands into 3rd party bloodsuckers.**

[A guide how to build your own node with 3 options/implementations](  
If you are not so familiar with using linux/Ubuntu, just buy one of those boxes already Plug&amp;Play configured with BTC/LN node and just finish the setup for your own needs. The time consuming, stress, documentation reading, testing etc is taking much more than you think. The price you are paying for those already configured boxes is cheap if you consider your time and stress more important.  
So if you want a quick easy way, just buy the box and be ready.  
If you want to play around and learn more by yourself, buy a NUC machine, install Ubuntu, install Bitcoin node, install LN node and start digging.  
Building your own node is fun, entertaining and educational. Is a good path to follow, but be prepared. We are at the beginning of a great journey, so you will need patience and desire to learn new things to do.

There is no such thing as **best wallet**.  
Each wallet have his own features, more or less approachable for a user. Each user should find his own use case for each wallet.  
The only thing that matter when you choose a wallet are 3 things:  
1. **you control your keys = you control your bitcoins**.  
2. If it doesn't support LN (now or in near future) is NOT worth it  
3. If it doesn't support segwit, is NOT worth it  
Here is a REAL list that should be taken in consideration for any noob:  
**Desktop Bitcoin Wallets**  
**1.Bitcoin Core**  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires ~5GB minimum disk space if prunned  
  
**2.Wasabi - Best High Privacy**  
Pros= Best Privacy with Chaumian CoinJoin built in  
Cons= Fees slightly higher and slower to send due to mixing  
  
**3.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Desktop and Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
Pros= Great privacy and security  
Cons= UX is for more experienced users, takes ~week to sync and requires lots of GB  
  
**Mobile Wallets** (only segwit compatible matter)  
**1.Samourai Wallet**  
Pros- Advanced Privacy features  
Cons- UX suffers due to lack of Fiat value displayed  
  
  
**2.Electrum**  
Pros= Great Android wallet with advanced functionality like coin control  
Cons= UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
**3.Green wallet**  
Pros- One of the better wallets for IOS. Features like multisig nLocktime for better security and 2FA not found in other wallets  
Cons- UX is not as polished as some other wallets  
  
  
**4.BRD Bitcoin wallet**  
  
**5.Mycelium wallet**  
  
**Bitcoin Lightning Wallets**

Until then maybe is too late...  
I was expecting you to answer my first question, but seems that you avoid it.  
So I will ask you this:  
- this is an SPV wallet, so I have to trust your node to verifiy/push my tx. What is this so "revolutionary" as you promote it on your website?  
- do you offer also the feature to connect this spv wallet to my own node?  
- this feature of sending BTC suing a tel number is not new (as you promote it), it was used by GetGemz wallet too, using Telegram fork. But on your webpage there is nothing to explain more about this "amazing/revolutionary" technology, just an empty/deleted medium article   
I don't see any "revolutionary" in this. I could easily send signed tx ID by email or chat to somebody else and that tx he can easily load up in ANY other wallet.  
- as you explained in your website (lacking of information), the tel number is used only to link a person to a new wallet generator. Is not this a violation of privacy?
@_date: 2019-03-19 14:43:44
Nice try Trastra to promote your "services" but is not gonna work. Your services are crap.  
I opened an account to test and see how it works and I was very disappointed.  
1. KYC/verification process went quite well, not too intrusive, not too long.  
2. A bit slow the deposit process. I tested with a payment from a EU client, SEPA transfer and took more than usual.  
3. Too many fees and high fees.  
4. There is no process of converting automatically a % or all deposit in BTC. I have to do that manually and for a fee and exorbitant exchange rate.  
Bitwage has better offer: just 1%, instant conversion, next business day process, no other hidden fees.  
Sorry Trastra but you have to do it better if you want to survive. Anyway these "crypto banks" will not survive any longer from this "transition" period.

It's even more simple.  
1. Write a letter, essay, article, book or whatever you like.  
2. Insert into the text your wallet seed words.  
3. Create your own code/pattern/positions to find them. Be inventive.  
4. Publish that text wherever you like (send an email to your family, post a blog article, write here on r/Bitcoin).

Feature request: use a PIN only for making payments.  
Use case: a shop, with employees that have to receive the payments from the customers. If the owner of the shop create a LN wallet for each employee or just one for the shop, how the employees can just receive, not making payments?  
We want to use LN in shops, to make payments, but we never think about the problems that generate for the shop owners.  
For onchain payments we have "read only wallets", fine, working perfect, but if we want to move the small txs to LN, how we can achieve that "receive only" with LN wallets?
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:24:53
Is not about **all your txs**, is about **any of your txs**.  
Chainanalysis companies are hungry for any info they can obtain, no matter the source or size. They will link it anyway in their giant databases. Please, don't feed them with any unnecessary info. They are just waiting for you to do that.  
If in 9 years you didn't learn how to protect yourself, maybe is time for you to do it now, I hope is not too late.

Let's say the shop already have a node machine, with bitcoind and c-lightning and spark wallet.  
Can connect to mobile wallet Spark and receive the payments. All OK.  
But comes the problem: how the employees will NOT have the ability to MAKE payments?  
You can make that all the customers that have to pay with LN will have to look for the manager to open a link into a computer, to show the QR code to scan to the customer, when in normal way the waiters have to go to the table and receive the payment?
So what do you suggest is that c-lightning implementation node is not good for merchants (bars, restaurants etc).  
How Eclair wallet can achieve this requirement? Or any other LN wallet?

Then use Bitwage.com Highly recommended to deal with nocoiners.  
They do not have to do anything, just pay you ina bank account as usual. Only that this time, you will have to provide them your bank account assigned to you from Bitwage.  
Once you receive your wage, Bitwage will make the conversion for you automatically. You can even split your income in % of BTC and % of fiat in the desired bank account or visa card.  
I used Bitwage for long time, works perfect. Now my clients/employees are paying me in BTC, so no use of Bitwage.

Yes. I use it for years until my employers/clients start paying me directly in BTC.  
Now I use it sporadically, only when a client do not have BTC and is hard for them to get/accept BTC.  
Works perfect as it is promoted.  
1. You create an account with Bitwage  
2. You receive an IBAN number  
3. That IBAN you provide it to your employer/client to pay your wage/invoices directly in their currency.  
4. You receive at instant exchange directly into your BTC wallet  
5. You could split your income. If you still want to use fiat, you can setup your Bitwage account to split the income in %s of BTC and fiat and you provide them a BTC wallet address and a bank account where to be sent your money.  
Done, you never get worried about buying BTC. For just 1% fee for your income is a fair price.  
It is also nice/useful for freelancers or contractors with clients from other countries/currencies.

1. Select a bar where you can pay with BTC/LN, or first convince the owner to be the test drive for that meet-up.  
2. Gather friends, local merchants, neighbours, at least one another bitcoiner that can help you (but not too many).  
3. Do not push too much the technical part of Bitcoin features, only if somebody is asking and keep the answers short so the whole audience can understand it easily.  
4. Focus more on where Bitcoin can fit well on each participant need. Remember: Bitcoin wasn't created only to lower the payment fees or replace paypal with another shitpay.  
5. Be the first one in making a payment demo with BTC to your host bar.  
6. Never give them free BTC, make small exchanges with discounts if you like. Free BTC means worth nothing. And is not. Say "I will give you x btc for x fiat, so you can pay yourself and test BTC". The payment experience is very important.    
7. Make jokes like: I will pay now my beer with BTC and in 1 year the bar owner will buy a new car with these money :)  
8. Let them ask all things, no matter how stupid questions will be. It's normal, be calm and try to answer to all. People are usually against any new changes in their life and will ask stupid things, but are very important for them.  
9. One of the most important thing: [Satoshi's papers]( -  **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

Electrum could be "moved" in 2 ways:  
- save/move the wallet file located into C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\Electrum\wallets into the new location where you installed new Electrum. Once you open Electrum app, will ask you for the password of that wallet (the one you created when you opened first time that wallet)  
- use your wallet seed (12 words) to restore your wallet into new location. Instead of choosing create new wallet, select restore wallet.

Chris please can you make a better documentation on how to install and configure Electrum Personal Server?  
1. For linux, please make a full specification on how to install it as a noob, step by step, what commands can make, not as a high level of knowing how to use Linux and dependencies.  
2. For windoze, is NOT working.  
3. Can we have a nice setup included into normal Electrum client, saying: do you want also to continue to install EPS not just Electrum wallet client?
If we want people to get their privacy in their hands at least let's give them good tools that can use them.  
Right now, very few people can and know how to install an EPS.  
For those who do not know what I am talking about, here is the link:   
I wonder how many users from r/Bitcoin were able to install their own EPS following EXACTLY these instructions from this github document.

LOL I see only user frustration about his own mistakes/understandings, not about any Bitcoin wallet.  
1. Work for bitcoins, earn them not buying them  
2. If you buy from an exchange, move them immediately to your own BTC wallet (where you control your keys)  
3. Buying BTC with credit card is just stupid. You pay too much fees and reveal too much of your identity. Use Bisq instead.  
4. Why do you need customer support from a wallet? It's open source, you can anytime post a feature request/improvement/issue on wallet github and devs can see it.  
5. Bitcoin = Be your own Bank. If you do not understand this, maybe is better to take it slowly and start learning more about the **responsability ** that come with *being your own bank*

Not too much. Make your calculations on how you are going to pay. Initial year or two count to pay from your own pocket, in a way that would not affect too much your life.  
Then once the price spike up at a level that you could pay the entire loan with just a fraction, sell a part, pay the debt and remain with the rest.  
Greed, be aware of your greed. As much your greed grows, you enter in a debt spiral. So be careful and calculate well all your moves.

[RaspiBlitz node](  
[Build your own node with Rasp Pi](  
[Build your own node with RaspiBolt](  
[Pierre Rochard Node](
Also you could just buy a HTPC [Gigabyte]( or [MSI]( or [Asus]( small boxes, fanless and start adding on them: Ubuntu, BTC node, LN node, EPS, RTL, BTCPay...  
An example: Gigabyte Brix 4core Intel Celeron 120€, 4GB RAM 27€, 1TB SSHD drive 68€ = 215€

1. Never ever put service price directly on website. Webdesign and all related is not a fix price. All depend on each project and negociation with the client.  
2. Don't put testimonials, are really subject to be fake even if are real. Put instead "projects", real projects use cases where you participate and other people can verify.  
3. The domain name is too long and boring. Choose something shorter and more agresive, to send a clear message

rsync command with a connected node is just fine. The snapshot of the database file is well done.  
The problem is if you **recover** that database file after a long time of your offline node, so the other nodes will see your node offline and close the channels. In the worst case scenario, you get the money from closed channels back after get confirmed. But you will never lose money.

Decentralization is the biggest enemy of force regulation.  


You just described brainwahsing.  
The thing is that Bitcoin already opened the "pandora's box" of decentralized knowledge. And you can't make people that already know and learned about Bitcoin to "unlearn" Bitcoin.  
So even it will be people using gov-centralized-"blockchains" it will be always other people using Bitcoin and decentralized systems. And those brainwashed people will always wonder: why these people using BTC are always happy, smiling and free and we are always oppressed, sad and persecuted all the time by our gov?

Some points of light in this matter:  
1. Ross was used as a patsy, to criminalize the use of Bitcoin, in those early years.  
2. LE created actually the SR site, then they coop Ross to continue it and manage it. They just "watching" from behind.  
3. All the case was built and managed from the beginning till the end. It's all a lie constructed around Ross in that way that people get anger and hate him (aka many people still believe that shit accusation of killing order from Ross, that was dropped in the case.  
4. All people should watch/listen the [Railroaded]( reveals BEFORE saying anything against Ross. Otherwise you are just a hater or a LE agent. Point and clear.  
5. **REMEMBER**, when Ross was the admin of SR, Bitcoin came in force and that doesn't like to LE and banksters. They have to create a case in order to put Bitcoin in a bad image. Ross was just the patsy.

"Aliant launched its crypto processing system for merchants, dubbed CryptoBucks, back in 2017 and developed a proprietary, fully compliant solution in July 2018 to process crypto payments, **converting them to USD, and offering merchants next day payouts**. "  
So they are giving to merchants that accept BTC, the shity USD and they hodl BTC and pay their employees with it. Nice move. Stupid merchant that accept the USD instead of BTC.  
I hope merchants will wake up and accept BTC directly not through ANY intermediary and do not exchange them to USD, just pay **their** employees with BTC.

Will tell you a story:  
In early years (2012-...) I also didn't believe in Bitcoin future.  
But I started buying every week or month, whenever I had some spare change (20-50-100€) I bought some BTC, from miner friends, from exchanges etc. ... **NO MATTER THE PRICE WAS**  
I always said: fuck it, if this will be a success currency I would win, if not, I don't care, those money I spend would be anyways spent on beers and hookers. So I better secure my future pension then drink a beer today.  
Today in 2019... it still applies, don't think about "how much will worth in fiat in 5 years from now". That's a total BS thinking. Fiat money will not exist anymore in the form we use it today.  
Think about how much things you could buy DIRECTLY with your BTC in 5-10-20 years form now.  
You are young, **SECURE YOUR FUCKING FUTURE WITH BITCOIN

- a brainless guy that can't read basics about Bitcoin

LOL name one. I never heard of analog computer.  
What is the difference between an analog and a digital computer?  


Do you have a proof, even if it's digital, that those money/ledgers exist and could be verified? No. We are lied about how much money exist in the world. That's it. It's all virtual.

All the time you want to move funds from an exchange to one of your wallets use Wasabi.

All this mania with fancy hardware wallets it's almost useless.  
I could put a seed into a picture using Steganography and NOBODY will know that the cats picture can contain 1000 BTC. Instead, if I wonder around with a hardware wallet like this, people immediately will know and will do everything possible to rob me.  
Hiding in plain sight is the best way to keep your BTC.

**TOTAL BULLSHIT**  
If I have 100k wallets created anonymous, and each with 100 BTC addresses, each address with 1 BTC, your nonsense stats are gone.  
Adoption could be measured in a simple way: how many merchants are accepting BTC in their stores.
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:15:47
But why is necessary a POS machine for a BTC/LN payment?  
I work with a lot merchants, but those machines are usually used to print a ticket for the payment with VISA as a proof of payment.  
Let's not confuse this ticket with the sales ticket, are 2 different things. The sales ticket is the proof of sale and the one that is important, that come from their ledger/sales system, as usual, x item, price, total cost, taxes etc.  
For Bitcoin payments you DO NOT need a ticket because it's a push payment system.  
For VISA payments, yes, you need a ticket as proof, because it's a pull payment system.  
These POS are worthless, useless, when is about BTC payment. A simple LN wallet for the merchant is enough. Even more than that, Zap wallet for example can use macaroons different access rights for an employee or a manager.  
A POS machine will have additional costs and more hassle for the merchant. A simple mobile wallet is ZERO cost and hassle.

NO.  
Just convince them to pay you directly with BTC from their wallets.  
Strategy:  
1. If they pay with BTC, give them 10% discount  
2. If they pay with VISA, add up to base price a 5% or even more.  
3. If they pay with cash, just normal price.

For all those new here, that do not know who really IS Bitpay, here is a must read for you.  
Bitpay was/is one of the main "promoter" of taking over the Bitcoin code using the so called SegWit2X fork, that specify clearly a filtered blockchain address (bad or good) and based on that, people get blocked or not to use BTC. This is a fundamental attack against Bitcoin.  
These links are a must read for all those who get NOW into Bitcoin so they will know about this issue and who are the perpetrators:  
    
  
  
  
   
  
  
  
  
  
  
**To all merchants out there: please consider NOT using Bitpay at all! Bitcoin was created to be used as P2P currency without ANY intermediary.**  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**    
Any intermediary between your BTC payment and the merchant is violating the definition of Bitcoin and your privacy.  
**Privacy is a right that we should all enjoy.**  
I use quite a lot Bitcoin for shopping. But if I see a merchant that redirect the payment page to a Bitpay check-out, I will cancel immediatelly the payment and **never use that merchant again (until they fix the problem)**. Total boycott for Bitpay!

We should never forget this: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**

**Just USE Bitcoin for everyday life, slowly get rid of fiat and close your bank accounts**  
That makes banks and govs OBSOLETE, they will be out of business, soon. And they can do shit about it.  
**THE SILENCE REVOLUTION IS BITCOIN**  
1. Don't complain that merchant do not accept it. Make it happen, convince them. Support those who already do it, buy only from them, that will push others to adopt it.  
2. As a merchant, give discounts for paying with BTC, put a markup for paying with VISA. Make it clearly visible for new clients that they will have a good choice by paying with BTC and dump the fucking spy visa.  
3. If you are still not paid in BTC, DEMAND it! Make your voice listen! Insist on your employer. If you are a freelancer, same as merchants, give discounts for paying with BTC or choose ONLY those clients that pays with BTC.  
The Revolution will not happen if you still use the fucking VISA for daily purchases (even worse if you use the so called Bitcoin debit cards). Stop using fiat and VISA, make the revolution to succeed. Don't be a fiat slave!

Why not do the way around.  
Every time they buy something from you, with normal cash, offer a small portion in return in satoshis.  
Let's say, every customer that buy a minimum xx amount, will get xx satoshis in return. Send them to a link where it explain how to use/open a new wallet (or create your own page explanatory, integrated into your website). Don't send them to the fucking Conbase, explain the difference between custodial and non-custodial wallets, give them some examples and let them do it right.  
Once they have their own wallet open, ask to provide a BTC address from their wallet to receive the satoshis.  
Then offer them even more: next time when they will buy with BTC will get x discount. You win always.

Tell to your "friend" that he can eat his dick, because that is a total bullshit.
@_date: 2019-12-06 21:13:06
Look, I have to confess in this matter.  
I work as an IT freelancer for many companies, individuals, merchants. For several years I dedicated my work to help them integrate BTC into their business. Firstly because I wanted to be paid in BTC.  
It's a small community area (somewhere in EU), not big cities around, some tourism, but mostly quiet people doing their business.  
It was hard to convince them but slowly they get into it. Once they understand "what the fuck is Bitcoin" and forget the "get rich quick scheme" bullshit idea, they are more and more interested into Bitcoin. Depends how YOU explain it to them.  
I started with local small meetups. In a bar of a friend that already accepted BTC (he's my "tester" for new things). We've tried almost all wallets, solutions, payment processors, exchanges etc.  
So with meetups I tried to get more people educated and have an open discussion with all, talking about their daily problems, payments etc and how BTC can solve some.  
Let's be clear: **Bitcoin do not fix everything!** There are many problems and people tend to deal with them in many different ways. First you need to be able to listen to them and then try to find a way using BTC together with them.  
First and foremost, they need to understand a damn important thing: **Bitcoin is money** is not a mumbojumbo bullshit "investment". Bitcoin is the form of money that they can sell their products/services fast, easy, private, permissionless, borderless and full control of their money. Once they get this, there is no way they will stop taking BTC.  
Secondly: never try to change their existing accounting/ledger/stock/sales systems. leave those as they are. Use Bitcoin ONLY as another form of payment, form of money. That's it.  
Third: Use simple solutions, that **do not violate the Bitcoin definition**: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: *Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.*   
If you go for intermediaries, you are back to square one. Nothing is built. You are back depending on 3rd parties bullshit.  
Today [we have plenty of solutions]( that offer best ways to use Bitcoin **without any fucking intermediary**.  
Fourth: try to convince them all **NOT TO SELL THEIR BTC FOR FUCKING SHIT FIAT!**  
All my clients/merchants that accept BTC never sell/convert their BTC immediately for fiat. They keep them and/or use them to pay employees/suppliers. "Volatility" is a total bullshit spread by media, to make people get into "day trading" and/or stay away from BTC. If you are smart you know how to deal with these ups/downs. It's simple: it's in red: BTFD, it's in green, wait, watch the shitshow.  
In conclusion: slowly, one by one, all merchants will get it. Patience and most important thing: EDUCATION.

1. [Steganography]( - hide your seed into a picture file. If you want another level of hidding, you could use  creating a simple phrase that hide your seed. That phrase insert it into a picture using Stego. Put that picture file on an encrypted USB or even post it on a "travel blog" or family blog, or simply store it in a private server. Make copies.  
[Example here](  
2. Hiding in plain sight: insert your seed words into large text, story, letter, essay, blog post etc. Send that text by email, post it online, or simply save it on an encrypted USB stick. Make copies.  
These are simple ways to hide and keep safe your HODL wallets (wallets that you almost never use, just deposit to them). Just save your xpub somewhere or only some BTC addresses of that wallet to be able to deposit to them, when is necessary. Or you could use a read only wallet with your xpub.  
Advantage: **NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW that your cats/family picture framed on your desk contains 10 BTC. Nobody will ever know that a letter to your mother contain 10BTC**.  
Even this post could contain a 1BTC. I used common words that could be a seed :)

Looks nice but **I am tired of this plethora of LND wallets!**  
Call to devs:  
1. Create a common interface for all types of LN nodes/implementations so users can connect their wallets to any type of LN node.  
2. Create wallets not only for LND but also for C-LN and Acinq. This division doesn't make sense. In the end I have to have a node for each type of LN implementation...

Why not just convince those corner merchants to accept your BTC.  
1. [Download BTC LN wallet]( (BLW)  
2. Open a hosted channel built-in, right away, with no need to deposit onchain and then use them to open channels. Ready to receive.  
3. Receive the payment with no effort !  
They can move anytime from hosted channel to a normal channel, by select "drain channel".

BTCPay is one of the solutions. In the article I shared with you is detailed how you can do it without btcpay.  
Is not about to measure your number of customers that pays with btc to cover your server maintenance.  
First you are doing in stages. You need to understand how it works, for you, how you deal with it, how your customers see it etc.  
Integrate it NOW even if you have only 1 customer. Later would be easier for you to upgrade it to a larger need, because you already know how to manage it. Take it a as a testing ground, get used to it, BEFORE going to mass.  
If you do not have it now, people would know that you accept BTc so you are waiting forever. Once you have it done, publish your webshop on the plethora of pages that promote shops with BTC/LN. In this way you get broader attention from bitcoiners.

That makes banks and govs OBSOLETE, they will be out of business, soon. And they can do shit about it.  
**THE SILENCE REVOLUTION IS BITCOIN**  
1. Don't complain that merchant do not accept it. Make it happen, convince them. Support those who already do it, buy only from them, that will push others to adopt it.  
2. As a merchant, give discounts for paying with BTC, put a markup for paying with VISA. Make it clearly visible for new clients that they will have a good choice by paying with BTC and dump the fucking spy visa.  
3. If you are still not paid in BTC, DEMAND it! Make your voice listen! Insist on your employer. If you are a freelancer, same as merchants, give discounts for paying with BTC or choose ONLY those clients that pays with BTC.  
The Revolution will not happen if you still use the fucking VISA for daily purchases (even worse if you use the so called Bitcoin debit cards). Stop using fiat and VISA, make the revolution to succeed. Don't be a fiat slave!

Normally you, the one that is getting onboard new users, you already have BTC on your LN wallet.  
Even if there is no "friend" to onboard you, as a new user, you do not need any previous BTC funds in order to be able to already receive funds in your LN wallet.  
Just open the wallet, connect to the hosted channel and done. Ready to receive.  
Consider a hosted channel as a "rented pocket". What is inside that pocket, it's yours, the host is only renting you the space. That's it.
Soon we will see BTC ATMs with LN ready, this will be a easy way to get BTC directly to your LN wallet directly, for the first time.

@_date: 2019-12-24 14:21:02
No, seems that you still don't get it and I will explain it to you in simple words.  
Bitpay was one of the promotors of idea of Segwit2X (segwit + 2MB blocks), but this was just a trick to fool users into agreeing with a code that could hijack one of the Bitcoin main feature: censorship resistance. If you read what S2X was proposing, it was also the option for miners and companies to **blacklist BTC addresses** as they please. That means everybody could be scrutinized for what they use their BTC. That means the real death of Bitcoin. This is what is doing actually Bitpay. Examples here:

Look also into steganography. Hide your seed into a picture file.  
It's a false idea that a hardware wallet will offer the best security.  
I never "recommend" a hw wallet.  
But what I do with my BTC in simple steps, that cost nothing, easy recoverable, nobody will know you have there BTC:  
1. [Steganography]( - hide your seed into a picture file. If you want another level of hidding, you could use  creating a simple phrase that hide your seed. That phrase insert it into a picture using Stego. Put that picture file on an encrypted USB or even post it on a "travel blog" or family blog, or simply store it in a private server. Make copies.  
[Example here](  
2. Hiding in plain sight: insert your seed words into large text, story, letter, essay, blog post etc. Send that text by email, post it online, or simply save it on an encrypted USB stick. Make copies.  
These are simple ways to hide and keep safe your HODL wallets (wallets that you almost never use, just deposit to them). Just save your xpub somewhere or only some BTC addresses of that wallet to be able to deposit to them, when is necessary. Or you could use a read only wallet with your xpub.  
Advantage: **NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW that your cats/family picture framed on your desk contains 10 BTC. Nobody will ever know that a letter to your mother contain 10BTC**.  
Even this post could contain a 1BTC. I used common words that could be a seed :)

Yes, I was the one posting that warning. I didn't respond it to you at the time because I wasn't online all the time.  
As others also said here, Conbase addresses are NOT using real Bitcoin Blockchain. Are just settlement addresses. Works like a sidechain.  
Conbase users can transact between them infinitely but no one can verify those txs as normal txs. That makes you think if Conbase really have those BTC in their custody or they are just using fictitious BTC for internal txs.  
Yes, once you send from your Conbase wallet to an external wallet, they make a real BTC tx and can be seen on blockchain, but what where was before, you cannot.   
Why do you think it takes 72h or more until you efectivelly receive the BTC in your real wallet? Because they are playing with others money until they manage to give to all withdrawals the total amount.  
They are a fucking bank on fractional reserve. Using Conbase as a wallet is the most stupid thing ever. Even as an exchange is stupid (see the reasons I posted before).  
**YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED. THIS IS NOT A JOKE OR TROLLING, IS A FUCKING FACT!**  
Yes, there are many here telling you that "Conbase is OK, I never had problems with them", but those are the brainwashed sheeple or paid shills to catch fools as much as they can and bring them to Conbase. This is the main goal of Conbase: register, monitor, trace, fuck as much btc users they can. They work closely with chain analysis companies and govs.

It is important, here just some 2 known issues:  
1. C-Lightning  
- you can't have more than 2 channels open with same node from the same wallet/user  
- you can have more than 1 node on the same machine using different ports for each node  
2. LND  
- you can't have more than one node running on the same machine  
- you can have more than one channel open with the same node and same wallet/user  
Now tell me what to choose between these 2, just based on these 2 "features".  
At this stage, we do not want to buy a "ready to go" node. We just want to test first which solution is better or more suitable for our needs.

Steve Jain: Bisq in the same way is like you’re becoming your own exchange. I think a lot of people think about exchanges as a service provided to you by another entity. But the Bisq model is that you become that entity, and you have full control over how you want to exchange or what you want to exchange, and on what terms you want to do that.
Wiz:	That’s a really good point. **If Bitcoin allows everyone to be their own bank, then Bisq allows everyone to be their own Bitcoin exchange.** That’s a really great way to sum it up. And Bisq is a lot like Lightning. It’s really this layer two system that’s built on top of Bitcoin.

Use your own [BTCPay server]( and you are perfect. On top of that you can use [Wasabi wallet](
@_date: 2019-04-06 18:43:06
BTCPay should have a way to make the payment in page of the webshop, not a redirect, using port 443. It will be much easier to implement/install/adapt to merchants systems.  
[C-lightning have a nice easy plugin for WP]( no need to reserve/use port 443 and a redirection to BTCpay server page.  
[LND also have a WP plugin]( that do not need redirection of payment page.  
BTCPay also have a WP plugin, but it still redirect to BTCPay server on port 443. This makes harder to implement when you have other servers/apps using the same port.  
BTCPay it's a nice solution but seems that in time gets more and more complicated. Maybe in the future we will have a **modular setup** so the user can choose and personalize more the installation of BTCpay server. BTCPay is a good solution but it was designed as being **the only one solution for a merchant**. Not giving flexibility to a merchant makes harder to implement a solution like that.  
I tried BTCPay and in the end I give up and looking for other ways to implement a LN payment solution.  
When I will try all my testing solutions maybe I will post here a comparison of all and what issues I had, pro/cons points for each. Users need to know all these things BEFORE starting any implementation. I usually see only HYPE for all solutions but a fair explanation of what is doing and what is not doing, what we should expect and what should not, we are just blindly start installing, configuring and then get stuck. Get over, start again, try another "tutorial" from github (each one in his way).  
Sincerely I have at least 1 month trying and trying all these implementations to see which one fit to my needs. It's a fucking jungle out there, there's no common way to do it together, and have a single voice/solution? A noob will really get confused in all these.

I use it many times.  
I do not accept fiat anymore so for those who still do not have BTC to pay me I just give them a bank account from Bitwage and I get BTC in the next day after they confirmed the payment.  
Yes users need to be verified.  
But what stops you to open an account in your name, but the BTC address for conversion is theirs... ?  
Or you just buy BTC and pay them directly in BTC.
Ahhh what you want is like an escrow service to be sure they do the job?

1. Buy from Bisq ( with SEPA, P2P, decentralized, permissionless exchange  
2. Withdraw to Wasabi wallet (  
3. Coinjoin  
4. Move to wherever you want wallet or just spend from there, coins that are impossible to be related with your real ID.  
**Reclaim your privacy now!**  
Another way is to find a seller in person from Mycelium wallet trading option. But again is better to anonymize your coins with Wasabi wallet if you really want to have privacy.

Fuck Amazon, Microsoft and all those big chains. They will never take Bitcoin because is against their own principles and want only to destroy all small local communities for more profits and on top of that they get zero taxation... meanwhile a local shop is trying to survive...
I am doing this for almost 8 years...

No man.  
Bitwage can be used by your remote workers to request from you in legal way to pay for their invoice. It is their problem how to make an account with Bitwage. If they are not allowed to use it, then, if you really want to help them, you could create an account with your name for them, as personal. But that account will appear in your payroll with your name, it is not good to be used like that as a company.  
Let's recap:  
- you have some job done by remote workers.  
- they sent you an invoice, in fiat, saying you will pay me x in x fiat money. No mention how will be paid, just an invoice.  
- you present that invoice to your squarehead accountant and say: I need to pay this invoice in cash. You get the cash or you just use your bank account to buy BTC, as for you.  
- use those BTC to pay your remote workers. DONE  
I do this to pay workers from Venezuela. I usually get them from job posting sites like I just sent you. They do the job, they get paid in BTC. Done.  
It was also a site named Bithours.com  that did a great tool for this, but seems dead now.  
Also there is Blockonomics I think that offer invoicing remote workers.

The amount of addresses used in a wallet are unlimited or almost infinite and is hard (not impossible) to track the connection between them. So not to worry about using the same wallet over the years.  
But, on the other hands, having a wallet with lots of addresses and txs could be a problem when is about to sync or reindex. Thne it is recommended to create a fresh one and much better a full segwit one, bech32.  
When you pass the coins from a wallet to another, don't forget also to pass through Wasabi wallet, with a nice Coinjoin and lose track of all past txs...

1. Start organizing meetups with friends, local merchants and make things happen.  
2. Buy a NODL box and start your own BTC + LN node, connect your wallets to your own nodes.  
3. Use Wasabi wallet to lose all traces from buying from a centralized exchange. You are not only protecting (reclaiming) your own privacy but also others.  
4. Limit your fiat currency usage, slowly but steady. Start spending more BTC in places where is accepted directly by the merchants  
5. Start working for bitcoins. If your employer still do not have BTC to pay you, you can start using Bitwage.com to receive your wage straight to your BTC wallet. Then try to convince your employer to buy/accept BTC so they can pay you in BTC.  
6. Use the existing services that allow you to pay your bills with BTC  
7. Finally the ultimate goal: be financial sovereign and don't use anymore banks and fiat.

I never "recommend" a hw wallet.  
But what I do with my BTC in simple steps, that cost nothing, easy recoverable, nobody will know you have there BTC:  
1. [Steganography]( - hide your seed into a picture file. If you want another level of hidding, you could use  creating a simple phrase that hide your seed. That phrase insert it into a picture using Stego. Put that picture file on an encrypted USB or even post it on a "travel blog" or family blog, or simply store it in a private server. Make copies.  
[Example here](  
2. Hiding in plain sight: insert your seed words into large text, story, letter, essay, blog post etc. Send that text by email, post it online, or simply save it on an encrypted USB stick. Make copies.  
These are simple ways to hide and keep safe your HODL wallets (wallets that you almost never use, just deposit to them). Just save your xpub somewhere or only some BTC addresses of that wallet to be able to deposit to them, when is necessary. Or you could use a read only wallet with your xpub.  
Advantage: **NOBODY WILL EVER KNOW that your cats/family picture framed on your desk contains 10 BTC. Nobody will ever know that a letter to your mother contain 10BTC**.  
Even this post could contain a 1BTC. I used common words that could be a seed :)

No, we want to build a LN node for his shop. Wallets also can be included in comparison due to the fact that some will connect ONLY to a specific LN node.    
We've tried with C-Lightning and LND using docker. And we've find some issues.  
Your link about wallets also is missing a key point: to which type of node can be connected. Not all wallets can connect to all types of nodes.
We would like to hear community opinions before we continue.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:57:18
I used c-lightning with docker. Create copies with rsync of docker volumes and you are good to go. I tested restore too. Works perfect.
C-Lightning is more adaptable to docker than LND.

You better dump any exchange that do not support segwit or at least can send to bech32 addresses. All those exchanges are an enemy of Bitcoin if they do not want to adapt to segwit.

Definitely you have a malware in your system, check for a rogue teamviewer service or remote tool, a malware that copy/paste another BTC address.

Did you ever question if they REALLY have those BTC in possession? Because if they don't... they just sell you promises, fakes, like other things they do.  
Or if you buy form that trade some BTC, did you really have the option to withdraw them into your OWN wallet where you have control over your BTC keys?  
Ask yourself these things.

Can we skip that step where I have to move from somewhere else wallet to this wallet some funds and then open a channel with the funds I already have on the onchain wallet?

yes, they will have bitcoind node into Wasabi installation. Yes it will validate the blocks, it's actually a copy of node app.

In your accounting are just as normal invoices. You are not putting there in BTC.  
Only the payment is done in BTC at current rate of exchange. Maybe just put a note on the invoice: paid in cash. You get your cash convert it in BTC and pay their invoice amount in BTC.

@_date: 2019-04-26 09:47:18
Yes.  
What I recommend is to use 3 levels of stashing.  
Buy from an exchange and withdraw to Wasabi wallet. Be aware that not all exchanges are supporting full segwit address as Wasabi wallet use (bech32 address, starting with bc1). So I suggest to use those that can send to this type of address.  
Once you withdraw to your Wasabi wallet, make a CoinJoin. Will result in a bunch of outputs that you can do the following:  
1. Move some into your regular HODL wallet (paper/steel/HW/whatever) that you will not touch for long long time.  
2. Keep some into Wasabi, as a buiffer zone. When is needed you could just move to mobile without touching your HODL the already untreaceable coins  or just use to pay directly.  
3. Move some to your regular mobile wallets (BTC onchain or LN) for quick spending.

**TOTAL NONSENSE**  
Bitcoin do not need any approval, reconnaissance, or legal framework in order to be used.  
The thing that is **decentralized** makes it immune to all that shit.  
All those maps are part of a psychological warfare to play with minds of noobs, creating this false idea that Bitcoin need regulation or legal approval from some kind of body.  


There's no such thing. Bitcoin is nor legal or illegal. It just it. Do yhou think also in those countries math is legal?  


I do not need any legal allowance to use Bitcoin. I will just use it because is a natural form of money that NOBODY can control it and NOBODY can stop me using it. Take out from your mind that shit idea that you need approval from somebody else in order to use Bitcoin.

First, to do a bank run, people need a motivation and that motivation start by learning the truth about the biggest lie in human history: actual banking system.  
When they will learn what's really happening, then naturally thry will just take out all the money from a bank and buy BTC.

Why not just use Bisq -  decentralized, P2P, censorship resistant, control your money 100%, built in escrow service, no verification KYC/AML, no price manipulation, no volume manipulation, no intermediary, open source, borderless etc.... **exactly as it is Bitcoin**. What do you need more?  
Please read their vision -  their FAQs  and watch demo videos:

What people are wrong about comparing Bitcoin with plastic cards is that they are looking only to the txs/s and fees.  
The most important aspects are these:  
- Bitcoin: nobody can censor your txs. Visa/MC does very often, because they can and want  
- Bitcoin: no need permission or limits to open an account. Visa/MC require much permission and restrict that permission  
- Bitcoin: you can't spend what you don't have/own (it's a feature not a bug). Visa/MC you can spend endless fake money and sometimes others money, you can even spend and request a pay back.  
Just think about that. Fees and tx number, speed is just a distraction...

@_date: 2019-01-21 12:26:23
I wonder if this scenario will work:  
- a guy from India put a "buy BTC" order on Bisq  
- I am from EU, so he have to send me the fiat to my EU bank account. Actually converting (in some way) his rupees into euros. I don't know if this is really possible.  
- When I am accepting this trade, actually he have to pay a markup fee to his bank for this conversion, because I will release the BTC only if I would receive my price in eur for that specific amount of BTC.  
Is there a way to use Bisq in this case?

Restoring seed **it is a recommended practice!** Only like that you are in total control of your money.  
That seed represent your keys control. You don't need to delete your actual wallet just for doing that. You could just open Electrum in another (your new one) pc and select restore from seed.  
You will have same wallet on both pcs.

Privacy is a right. If you do not enjoy your privacy, then you are just another ignorant that give up all his rights to his masters.  
Nowadays, people get BTc from "regulated" exchanges, that means EVERYTHING is tracked, monitored, registered, linked in a giant database of chain-analysis. The goal is to keep log of every BTC user.  
By using Wasabi wallet, you are just losing track of these evil practices and get back your privacy.

Put a simple sign: We accept Bitcoin. You pay with BTC you get 10% discount. You don't have BTC, then you can buy from this ATM ----&gt;  
Then just leave some BTC brochures around with more info so they can read.  
Making them to buy BTC but without a way to spend them is worthless adoption. Any person that will use B TC and see that they obtain some kind of advantage, will use it. Otherwise will not be interested. Don't sell the bullshit of trading, get rich quick etc That will fade quick. Bitcoin is far more than that.

You can use Bitwage.com if the client do not have BTC to pay you directly in fiat and you receive BTC.  
If the client have BTC, you just make the invoice in your local tax payment currency and mention the payment method in BTC and your address to the client. That's it.  
Your tax authority do not have to know how you received the money. You are reporting your sales based on your invoicing not the method of payment.

REPEAT THIS OVER AND OVER.  
Forget about all the FUD and FOMO.

Make people around you using BTC. Then it turns into a local community currency. You don't need any "approval" for doing that.  
This is the silent revolution that will win.

What people should understand is that nowadays, ANY "occupy" street movement is a trap/scam/orchestrated movement by the same LE, to create the means of stripping citizens of more rights.  
Don't be fooled by all these false "revolutions".  
The True meaningful revolution is the Bitcoin Revolution, the silent revolution.  
Just use BTC as money and you slowly dig the grave of the banksters and together with them the evil govs and politicians.  
Govs and politicians are the executive hand of the banksters, are NOT your representatives... **wake the fuck up!**

That sounds like a damn theft, no? There's no difference if a thief will force you at gun point to give him 10-30% of your money...

We better give up some satoshis and create a common fund and rent a big fucking place that will be also broadcasted on some good placed billboards all over the world.  
Invite some good music groups that support Bitcoin, maybe Andreas to do a short halvening speech".  
I agree we should do something big so the whole world will know it.

Conbase is using their own chain, as a fractional reserve. They never make it available the proof of funds.  
They function exactly like a bank: take 10 bucks from depositors and give 100 (fictional) bucks to others, inside their wallets system.
When this lie will blow up it will be really bad... really bad.  
**Conbase is a bank, created and funded by the banksters ([BBVA]( and will act always like a bank (aka fuck the users). Their goal is NOT to help people to get into Bitcoin, but to register them, track, monitor, seize, "share" their personal data with "3rd parties" etc. It's a banksters tool to keep almost all BTC users in control.**  
[Recently even a federal prosecutor join the board of directors of Conbase, so imagine what's next...](  
[Almost all CB users will end up fucked by CB like these ones](  
[Conbase was even sued for misconduct in managing people's money](  
[Conbase did not implement Segwit and is losing people's money](  
[Wikileaks start a boycott against Conbase](  
[Conbase closed Gab account](  
[Conbase aquired a surveillance company, Neutrino, to integrate their chainalisys code into more surveillance of Conbase users](  
  
[You want more? Here is a list](  
Reminder: [Satoshi's papers]( stated: **Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  
BTW, I never saw the proof of stake from Coinbase users funds on the real blockchain. I suspect that they use a some kind of fractional reserve with people's money... that means... what you see on your CB balance are not real BTC, but just a promise (IOU) to pay you those BTC...  
A "[MtGox case]( can happen anytime with this Coinbase shit.

We had various warnings about Wirex here. I found this list from a quick search on this sub.  
People, when you see a warning, do NOT ignore it. Don't fall into these traps immediately. At least do your job and investigate more BEFORE you use a "service" like these.  
Noobs, please DO NOT fall into these traps of "bitcoin banks". Use your own BTC wallet or nothing. Use BTC when you can pay with BTC, or fiat when BTC is not accepted. Point and clear. ANY "solution" to make a bridge between BTC and fiat is a trap or a scam.

Simply because Bitpay is the fucking enemy of Bitcoin! They are the enemies of segwit and will never support segwit addresses.  
Your electrum app is generating full segwit address (bc1...) and that is against Bitpay policy.

No need for that shit bridge. Use BTC as money.  
Remember WHY Bitcoin was created in the first place? **Exactly to get rid of all these "bridges" and intermediaries: Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.**  - this is the first phrase from Satoshi's papers.
