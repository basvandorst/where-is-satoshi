There is a valid argument against Bitcoin in there.
No security is perfect.  With traditional currency and traditional banks, a human can intervene after a security breach.  If your checking account was drained by a hacker, you will get your money back.
There's no human intervention with Bitcoin.  If your Bitcoin wallet is drained by a hacker, you have no recourse.
The article questions the security to the Bitcoin protocol, which experts believe to be sound.  But it mainly questions the security of third parties like Gox:


Like it or not, you need exchanges for Bitcoin to succeed, and exchanges are vulnerable.  Even if the Bitcoin protocol is 100% sound.

Well, your interpretation doesn't actually mean anything.  Here's a look at the *actual definition* of money transmitter.


(i) In general. (A) A person that provides money transmission services. The term "money transmission services" means **the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value** that substitutes for currency **from one person** and the **transmission of currency, funds, or other value** that substitutes for currency **to another location or person by any means**. "Any means" includes, but is not limited to, through a financial agency or institution; a Federal Reserve Bank or other facility of one or more Federal Reserve Banks, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, or both; an electronic funds transfer network; or an informal value transfer system; or (B) Any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. 
(ii) Facts and circumstances; Limitations. Whether a person is a money transmitter as described in this section is a matter of facts and circumstances. The term "money transmitter" shall not include a person that only: (A) Provides the delivery, communication, or network access services used by a money transmitter to support money transmission services; (B) **Acts as a payment processor to facilitate the purchase of, or payment of a bill for, a good or service through a clearance and settlement system by agreement with the creditor or seller**; (C) Operates a clearance and settlement system or otherwise acts as an intermediary solely between BSA regulated institutions. This includes but is not limited to the Fedwire system, electronic funds transfer networks, certain registered clearing agencies regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC"), and derivatives clearing organizations, or other clearinghouse arrangements established by a financial agency or institution; (D) Physically transports currency, other monetary instruments, other commercial paper, or other value that substitutes for currency as a person primarily engaged in such business, such as an armored car, from one person to the same person at another location or to an account belonging to the same person at a financial institution, provided that the person engaged in physical transportation has no more than a custodial interest in the currency, other monetary instruments, other commercial paper, or other value at any point during the transportation; (E) Provides prepaid access; or (F) Accepts and transmits funds only integral to the sale of goods or the provision of services, other than money transmission services, by the person who is accepting and transmitting the funds.
The second bold explains exactly why your gas company isn't a money transmitter.

And literally every economist in the world would disagree with you.  Let's define deflation as the lowering in price of commodities.
If commodities becoming less expensive, it would be foolish to invest in commodities or their production.
Another way to look at it is not that commodities are getting less valuable, but that cash is becoming more valuable.  That makes cash a great investment, much better than production.
So people with money hoard it.  They don't invest it in the economy.
Now imagine you are the CEO of Apple.  That's a valuable company that makes a lot of product, contributes a lot to the economy, and has a huge pile of cash on hand.  If deflation hit, it wouldn't make sense for Apple to invest in new technology or factories, since their new products won't sell for as much money, and in the future they could even end up taking a loss on their products.  It would be better to hold on to their cash and wait until prices hit a minimum.  The end result is that they don't build, they don't research, they don't produce, they don't hire.
@_date: 2013-04-16 10:13:17
I would argue that most of the demand is currently due to investors trying to make a quick buck, not "how much stuff people want to trade for bitcoins".
Here's why your math is wrong, which is pretty simple.
Let's say there are 1 million coins out there and that all the exchanges report a total daily trading volume of 1,000,000 coins.  Then the average coin is being held for 1 day by your math.
But "daily trading volume" counts coins that were traded multiple times.  It's likely that there is a small subset of coins which is being traded rapidly (by short-term speculators and particularly by HFT bots).
For simplicity, let's say only 100,000 coins are being traded 10x per day.  In this case, the average coin isn't being held for 1 day, the average coin is **never being traded**.
Recent vs. long-term volume doesn't matter.

For people to "flee to Bitcoin", they must be able to buy it on exchanges.  Any large purchase of Bitcoin is going to leave a trail, since you have to buy in through traditional means.  That's very easy to track and shut down.
Sales taxes are tracked on the business end, and businesses get audited.  If they are accepting large amounts of Bitcoins, it's going to be pretty obvious to the auditors.  That's easy to shut down.
Businesses get to write off the cost of paying employees.  If they pay in cash/Bitcoin and don't report it, they have to pay more to the government.  That's why the only people who get paid cash "under the table" are temporary workers, illegal workers (e.g. undocumented or drug dealers), or are being paid by individuals instead of businesses (e.g. paying a teenager to mow your lawn).

It's illegal to kill someone by hitting them with a car when the accident is due to unsafe behavior on your part.


Since it's only illegal to kill someone while driving unsafely, this makes no sense.  It's not a crime to hit someone if you are driving safely, so why would it be a crime to drive safely?


It is.  Truck drivers can only drive so many hours per day, for this very reason.


There's nothing inherently unsafe about being drunk away from home.  And there are plenty of safe alternatives to driving home.


Or, you know, we could make it illegal for that person to drive (which we do).


Not at all.  The activities mentioned which are illegal involve someone already committed to an unsafe act (driving drunk, truckers driving for too many hours, driving with certain medical conditions).  Once the person is **driving** drunk/tired/etc., they have willingly endangered those around them.
Plenty of people drink at a bar and take a cab home.  It's not illegal because they haven't engaged in the unsafe act (the driving).  So it's not arbitrary at all, actually.
@_date: 2013-05-04 14:12:09


Yes, you are.


I already explained ways that governments can continue to collect taxes.


The same reason cash-only businesses can't: because an audit will find discrepancies and put the business owner in jail.


It's not possible, which was my point.  **Exchanges can't be decentralized.**  You need to have a way for paper money to be exchanged for Bitcoin, and that can be shut down.


So if you believe it's inevitable, you should invest everything you own in Bitcoin, and do it now.  Sell your house, your car, your computer, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:15:54
The article presupposes that cryptocurrency will replace fiat, which is a huge assumption.
The article then presupposes that governments will have no means available to track people's spending nor to collect taxes.  But people still have to get paid and they still have to buy things.  The government requires employers to report income paid to employees, so the IRS can still come after you for taxes.  When you place an online order, the company still needs a name an and address to ship their item to, so why can't the government use it to collect a sales tax?  And the list goes on.


They can shut down enough of them and freeze enough money so that nobody is willing to make an international $5000 wire transfer if there's a decent chance they will lose their money.


First, the only way to transfer fiat anonymously is via cash (paper money).  Any wire transfer, money order, etc. can be traced and shut down.  Therefore, any p2p exchange is going to have to handle paper money.
So, if you would, please explain how you are going to use paper money on a p2p network, with people feeling safe and without governments being able to intervene.

If the US bans Bitcoin, what you describe would probably be a federal crime.  Spending time in federal prison is a pretty huge externality that someone spending their Bitcoins abroad would take into account.


It has to have a price in USD for people to accept it as currency.  If a pineapple costs 1 bitcoin, and a pineapple is worth $3, then a Bitcoin is worth $3 (assuming no transaction cost).  If you have a scenario in which Bitcoin can NOT have a value in USD and still be useful, I would like to hear it.


Drugs are things that are purchased and consumed.  Just buying a drug imparts its value to you (since you can smoke it, etc.).  Bitcoins are purchased and traded with either a legitimate business or for something illegal.  Let's look at each case.
Legitimate businesses are required to keep track of payments so that they can be taxed.   Stopping legitimate businesses accepting Bitcoin only requires auditing businesses (which already happens).
Illegal vendors don't keep records, so this isn't an issue.  But people selling illegal things still need to purchase things from legitimate businesses; if a drug dealer can't buy a car/house/food/clothes with Bitcoin, he will simply stop accepting Bitcoin.  He's already a drug dealer, he doesn't need to buy more drugs.
But what if there are people selling cars, houses, food, and clothes and are accepting Bitcoin?  For that to happen, all of those things now have to be black market.  The government assesses property tax, so you can be sure they know every time real estate changes hands.  They make you pay car sales tax to get a title so you can have a license plate, so they know when a car changes hands.  And producing clothing or food requires paying people to grow, harvest, and process agriculture, and those people aren't going to accept a currency that won't buy them a house.


No, it hasn't actually.  Two things happened: businesses able to have adapted their products to the current situation (see Starcraft 2 and SimCity) and they started going after the big fish (ISPs and sites like MegaUpload).

Another way of looking at the "government" controlling the monetary system is that US citizens control the monetary system, indirectly via representation.  So you still have a group of people ceding control over their monetary system to a cryptologic algorithm, which I don't see happening.


Increasing the money supply (which tends to create inflation) actually does the opposite of what you suggest.  It makes hoarding cash a terrible investment, since the value of that cash is diminishing.  If increasing the money supply made people wealthier, it is because those people took risks and invested their money (which should benefit the economy as a whole).  It's not because they hoarded their cash.


I don't know which bank you are referring to.  In most countries, there is a treasury and a central bank that is charged with regulating the currency.  Commercial banks don't regulate currency, they provide investment and lending services to people and businesses.
Bitcoin gets around the issues of central banks.  However, if Bitcoin is successful, customers will demand commercial bank services and will have the same issues with their banks.  International money transfers will be easier, and privacy will be easier to maintain, but those things aren't going to hurt a commercial bank's bottom line.

From the Federal Reserve Bank's website:




I never said there was no downside to inflation.  I said manipulating inflation can be useful for an economy.


What does "rigged" mean?
The 2008 bailout was a piece of legislation passed by Congress.  The constitution says that Congress has the power "to coin Money and regulate the Value thereof."  So, yes, it was completely legit.
Of the TARP bailout package, 469/475 billion dollars have been repaid.  The interest on loans provided by the government will likely yield a profit for the Treasury.


I don't see how Bitcoin solves this problem.  Banks are still going to invest the money of their customers (that's what a bank does).  If those investments go sour and they lose too much money, they will become illiquid and be unable to pay their customers back.
The difference is that with something like Bitcoin, the government has fewer options to prevent bank runs, keep credit lines open, etc.
The real solution is to regulate the risks banks are able to take, but that doesn't depend on the currency used.  And that's what a lot of people were trying to do.  Banks have good lobbyists, though.

Government-issued currency allows governments to control their own monetary policies, monitor international transactions, seize assets of criminals, and increase their tax base.
But Bitcoin is to a government's advantage because of its "stability"?

What Utah is doing is very different, and is basically what E-Gold was doing.
There is a bank in Utah where you can deposit gold and silver, they issue you a debit card, and when you want to purchase something, you are charged (in dollars) to your gold balance at the current exchange rate.
You are still paying with dollars and merchants are paid with dollars.  It just allows your savings to be held in gold, which over the last few weeks, would have lost you a lot of money.
Arizona hasn't enacted such a system, but are considering it.

The other things you mentioned have legitimate uses.
Money laundering is "the process of concealing the source of money obtained by illicit means," so by definition, it has no legitimate use.

What are you talking about?  It's a matter of e-filing an form on their website and there's not even a fee.


No, it's a measure to prevent money laundering.  Money laundering helps terrible things happen: human trafficking, child pornography, terrorism, etc.

That appears to be a state requirement, not a federal one, and the amount varies.
In Florida, for instance, the amount is between $50,000 and $2,000,000, depending on transaction volume.
Would you want to send large sums of money to an exchange that can't even provide $50k of collateral?
@_date: 2013-08-16 02:42:33


No, it doesn't, since the producers of other commodities are able to control the supply.
If the price of wheat falls to less than it costs a farmer to grow it, the farmers will farm something else instead.  The supply will decrease until the price becomes profitable again.

I figure that as soon as the FBI or CIA are able to demonstrate BTC moving between the US and Pakistan/Iran, it will be good politics to start knocking the dominoes down.

Realistically, if Bitcoin goes bust, the causation is likely to work in the other direction: a loss of Bitcoin functionality leading to a mass sell-off.
To me, the best candidate for this happening is outlawing of exchanges.  We are already seeing some shut down recently.
Yes, I understand that Bitcoin can still works without exchanges, but realistically, legitimate businesses won't accept it if they can't legally get fiat currency for it.

It doesn't work that way.  If the price dropped to the point that miners lost money, many of them would turn off their rigs.  The difficulty would decrease until it was profitable for most miners.
You would end up reaching a steady state where a few miners with more efficient rigs (or not paying for their electricity) are making a small profit, most rigs are just barely breaking even, and there are excess rigs turned off because it's not profitable to mine on them.
None of that affects the price of the bitcoin, since the supply isn't being affected much (still getting 25 coins per block).  There would be a tiny effect since there's a lag on difficulty adjustment, but that would be a few hundred coins out of 10 million+ (not enough to change price).

One important distinction to make is that any time you pay with your credit card, you are essentially exposing your "private key" to whatever entity is charging your credit card.  You don't expose your private key when making a Bitcoin transaction.
You are right, though, Bitcoin forces the user to take responsibility for security.  And unlike credit cards, once someone steals your Bitcoins, you can't get them back.  This is a huge obstacle to widespread consumer adoption.

Yea, that's pretty much the worst idea I've ever heard.

So it doesn't work very well as a currency if nobody can buy in or cash out.
Businesses have expenses (e.g. taxes) that they must pay in traditional currency, so they need to be able to switch Bitcoins into cash.
Individuals can't buy things with Bitcoins if they can't buy Bitcoins.

You introduce a false dichotomy: for one currency to succeed, the other must fail.  Krugman's point was different: why fix it if it ain't broke?
You may feel that the current system is broke, but investors have a plenty of faith in the current monetary system (as evidenced by the low yields on US treasury bonds).
Bitcoin isn't a good currency, at least not yet.  It's not liquid enough nor widely accepted enough.  It's a thinly traded commodity.  The market just recently broke $1B, but the active trading market is far smaller than that (since so many coins are being hoarded).
The price of Bitcoin is almost entirely supported by speculation.  Most people buying into it are doing so because they think it will be worth $200 next week of $500 next year, not because it has added functionality over traditional money/investments.

Yes, it is a logical fallacy.  See here   The fact that someone else has had the same idea doesn't make it less wrong.


It is illegal in most places, and texting is quickly becoming illegal as well.


In many states, there are limits on how many teenage passengers a teenager can have in the car for this very reason.


And that's why you are spouting nonsense on the internet instead of drafting legislation.


So attempted murder shouldn't be a crime?  People should be able to make bombs and bring them onto airplanes, so long as they don't detonate them?  That makes so much sense.


Driving drunk is an essential freedom?  We seem to have different definitions of essential.
@_date: 2013-06-07 02:25:16


You said:


right here 


Definition of safe: Protected from or not exposed to danger or risk; **not likely** to be harmed or lost.
Nothing has ever been 100% safe, so to demand 100% safety of an activity is absurd.  Obeying all traffic laws while driving makes driving **safe**, since you are not likely to be harmed.
Being drunk makes driving much less safe.  It's also unnecessary.


It's illegal because it's an unnecessary risk that you are willingly subjecting other people to.


I heard slippery slope is a great logical argument.

By transaction fees, I was referring to fees imposed by exchanges, etc.


And by selling it for dollars, you are acting like Western Union in my example.


You are taking bitcoins and sending them, electronically, to an address provided by the buyer.


I think they are wording it that way to protect against a direct miner to buyer sale, which could avoid money laundering regulations and taxations.  But the example you present does make the FinCEN wording look silly.


I'm no legal expert, but it might.  Maybe this is the government's approach to regulating bitcoin: all miners have to register as money transmitters.

1. It's laughable that you think Bitcoin will kill government-issued currency.  Do you really think governments will suddenly find themselves unable to collect any tax?
2. It's laughable that you think governments will be unable to shut down Bitcoin.  If exchanges are made illegal, and companies not allowed to pay employees in Bitcoins, it all ends.
3. It's laughable that you think the entire world will fall into poverty, leaving only the wealthy luminaries currently circlejerking all over this subreddit.
4. It's laughable that you foresee a unified world government as arising (EVER), much less to combat a rogue digital currency.
5. It's laughable that you think the only way to avoid these problems is for the people of the world to beg for your wisdom and generosity.
Maybe sad is a better word than laughable.

Krugman is 100% correct, though.
Bitcoins, at this time, are almost entirely held by speculators.  People are mostly mining and buying them because they think they may become more valuable in the future.

To me, that seems incredibly easy.  It may not even require a law for the IRS to do this.

1. Bitcoins are either mined or purchased.
2. Mining is so difficult at this stage that only large-scale, dedicated operations can expect to successfully mine.  And it is becoming more difficult by the minute.
3. For people to buy coins, there needs to be a real-world financial transaction that takes place.
4. Unless they involve only cash exchanged in person, real-world financial transactions can be tracked, regulated, and easily shut down if governments decide to do so.  Note that such cash transactions would likely be illegal
5. There are plenty of ways to buy things online or send money internationally that don't require an illegal face-to-face cash transaction.
