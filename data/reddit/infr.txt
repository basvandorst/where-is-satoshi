You offer to add a bank account in the German version, but then it states my bank routing number (Bankleitzahl) is wrong. If you do not support it, better hide this option then!

just withdrew 5 btc, the tx is labeled as finished but doesnt show up since 1h. not what i am used to...

It is due to the nature of elliptic curves. Bitcoin addresses are derived from the public key, which is basically just a point on an elliptic curve (described by an x- and a y-coordinate).
As you can see in the examples on  elliptic curves are symmetrical to the x-axis. This allows you to fully describe a point on the elliptic curve by just giving the x-coordinate and the sign of the y-coord. 
The latter is called compressed, because it is roughly half the size of an uncompressed one. So you can describe the same point on the curve with 2 different byte strings on the code level which also translate to 2 different addresses.
As far as I know, Bitcoin first used uncompressed keys and then at some point switched to compressed ones (some wallets still use uncompressed ones, still legit from a cryptographic perspective).

Actually the key space is 2^256 - 􀀀2^32 - 􀀀2^9 - 􀀀2^8 - 2^7 - 􀀀2^6 - 􀀀2^4 - 􀀀1 but yes, your argument is still pretty much valid :D

Yes, Bitcoin uses a weird mixture of big and little endians... It seems not to be always clear why. Edit: But txids come out of the hash function as BE and need to be stored in the blockchain as LE, so your edit nails it.
Btw, you have to differentiate between BE/LE and MSB/LSB. Former is the order of bytes, latter the order of bits. A bignum integer can be a little endian but still with every byte ordered with MSB first.

maybe  ?

Sorry, I was wrong, the key space is defined by [1, n-1] where n is 0xFFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C
D0364141 (even smaller than the number above).
I confused n (the order of the base point G) with p, the prime defining the finite field.
The public key is Q = k * G, where k is the private key. k has to be smaller than n, because n * G = 0, thus invalid.

to be precise, i got charged $10,29 for buying $10 directly by circle (already displayed before buying, as stated in my post above).
Postbank now shows i paid $10,29 to circle (not splitting the amount anyhow) and charges 1,85% on top for foreign currency usage.
that's it.
@_date: 2014-11-11 08:36:35
Yep, almost correct.
The compressed key additionally to the x-coord includes a byte to tell whether the y-coord is positive or negative (or, in EC math, odd or even), to fully describe the point on the curve.
already explained the resulting lengths (33 = 1+32 bytes compressed, 65 = 1+2*32 bytes uncompressed).
After Bitcoin switched to compressed keys, of course old addresses still needed and need to be valid though, so both exist in parallel now.

I can watch it from Germany without any extra means...
@_date: 2014-11-10 12:41:15
Try  !
@_date: 2014-09-29 12:34:41
just tried it with PBNKDEFF (Postbank), still the same error...

Postbank Visa
buy: 1.85%
sell: 0%
(+ the fees displayed by circle)

I have a German phone number which starts with 0176 + 8 digits. I want to sign up via the Android App. So I choose +49 and type in 176xxx... which are 11 digits in total, but it is limited to 10. No fix yet.
@_date: 2015-01-20 09:34:49
Am I the only one who cannot type in his phone number in full length to sign up?!

i have visa cards from postbank and consors, both are nfc enabled.

damn, and I ordered 2 days ago...

i sent bitstamp a copy from an election notification with my name and address on it. no problem at all.

ahhh give me book 2!

looks like the output of a pi-controller :)

take a look at this:

pasting e.g. 
gives me an error...
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:33:10
maybe a currency switcher?
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:27:43
Neither does Germany.
