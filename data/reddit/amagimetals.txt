The title is misleading, however we will stop accepting payment in fiat after 2016.

The dollar is screwed. When? I don't know. It may take a catalyst such as China no longer buying US Treasury bonds, something like that.
From a business perspective I do not want dollars after 2016. We may lose some business by doing so, but I would rather be safe than sorry and stuck with worthless fiat.

I do think silver is undervalued. As long as politicians keep printing the dollar to infinity their prices will continue going up.
That does not mean that their value changes. The change in value is the dollar. I think that their value has remained relatively the same, and will do so in the future.

We apologize for the delay. I can assure you our shipping times are some of the best, however we have made a huge move to a larger facility which caused a delay on a batch of orders.

I see a continued domino effect of businesses around the world adopting and accepting bitcoin.
A year ago 1 company on the top 100 websites accepted BTC, today it is over 10% and growing.
Once PayPal begins working with BTC it won't be long for Amazon too. I think that will be the tipping point for BTC adoption.
@_date: 2014-08-26 03:21:18
I like to recommend people invest in what they know. More people know and understand precious metals. Most people don't understand cryptocurrency. Heck, I've been studying bitcoin for two years now, and I still don't know much about it.
I recommend to everyone to purchase $20 worth of bitcoin so they can start learning about it and understanding it before they dive right in.

Great question!
The cost of accepting bitcoin must go down, which is currently happening. As soon as the cost of holding dollars is higher than BTC, businesses will begin switching over to BTC only as payment.
In my opinion, convincing people that magic internet money is the way of the future is one of the biggest challenges facing bitcoin adoption.
I've been studying BTC for over two years now, and there is still so much I can/want to learn about it.
We need to get grandma using it on a daily basis without her having to know its intricacies. They have to be able to "trust" that it works without having to understand that its decentralizing technology is revolutionary.
This requires development of new technology to lower the cost of using it. It would be great for people to buy things at a restaurant or retail store with BTC without having to have a phone on them. I think banks need to integrate BTC into their systems and allow people to have bitcoin debit cards, for starters.

The video and rationale is extremely flawed. We won't be selling the silver, but we want to help educate those who misunderstand bitcoin. Are they a lost cause? Or is there hope?
@_date: 2014-07-17 16:30:53
The point is that bitcoin has thrived thus far all on a voluntary basis, there have been no government regulations, "consumer protection" rules, or any other government (mafia) oversight. Now they want control over bitcoin. They just want more power over our lives.

Many of our customers are first time customers, so we don't want to overwhelm them. I'm trying to focus our product offerings on bullion, rather than numismatics, and I think we will stick with that trend for now.
@_date: 2014-08-27 18:45:09
Thank you so much for your business.
Right now, it depends. We've had some major, major internal infrastructure changes over the last year as we've been growing rapidly.
I realized I wasn't thinking big enough and we kept hitting bottlenecks which slowed shipments. However most of the changes are complete and we're getting back into the swing of things. We have the ability now to move from a million dollar business to a billion dollar business without bumping into these bottlenecks down the road.
In general we ship 3-5 business days after an order is placed with us. My goal is to ship all orders within 24 business hours. We're in a fast paced global economy now and people want things as soon as they pay for them. Many shipments are getting out within 24 hours, however we're not at the point that every shipment is out within 24 hours, so we cannot promise that yet. We're adding additional staff members over the next month to help us with this commitment!
@_date: 2014-08-27 19:44:40
We're not in the refining/minting business, so I'm not sure. I've toured many mints, though and haven't heard anything about this. I will be sure to keep it in mind next time I'm at one, though!

We never stopped accepting bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-08-27 21:14:03
The earliest adopters of BTC have the highest costs. They can't use BTC at the exact store they want for the exact items they want. They must spend time to find a store to be able to buy stuff with BTC. They must convert BTC to something else to pay for utilities. They must always ask other companies/individuals about whether they accept BTC or not.
That cost goes down as adoption grows. At some point the reverse will happen and the cost of holding/using dollars will skyrocket.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:13:47
I'm not going to speculate on whether they are being paid. I would like to think no, but who really knows.
There are many different factors. The media is confused about BTC, and so they confuse the masses about it. Some people still think bitcoin has a CEO!
Dinosaurs have a difficult time wrapping their head around BTC. They think they know everything and so they entrench themselves into the mindset that bitcoin is a ponzi scheme, a tulip mania, something with no value because you cannot touch it, etc. It's sad because they are unwilling to sit down and do the research themselves and discover why bitcoin is so revolutionary, why it is so important for our era.
The cost of using bitcoin (time spent, ease of use) is going to have to be less than the cost of using fiat to give these dinosaurs an incentive to use it.
I think that is going to happen soon. Developers around the world are working right now on making bitcoin easier to use. On the flip side, bureaucracies around the world are adding more and more regulations to the current financial framework making it more costly to use their system with their rules.

It really depends. Margins in precious metals are thin and we must convert our non-profits to USD to purchase new inventory (for now).

What if an individual is less risk averse and wants to earn interest on their BTC and want to put their BTC in a place that has less than 100% reserves? Now, because of government force, that individual cannot do that.

The very nature of a sound currency is that it is a commodity.
You can buy things with dollars today. So one cannot deny that the dollar currently has value. That does not mean that it is a sound currency.
The value of the dollar is created through a coercive monopoly, not through voluntary exchange. If the government allowed for competing currencies, a commodity backed currency would soon arise and the dollar in its current form would lose all of its value almost instantly.

I hate speculating on behind the scenes manipulations/conspiracies. There are some ongoing court cases about silver fixing, so I wouldn't be surprised if there is some kind of manipulation, but I don't care too much. When there's a buy opportunity, there's a buy opportunity and vice versa.
Also, blockchain technology will soon be used on developing decentralized commodity exchanges that will prevent any kind of fraudulent manipulation.
I think bitcoin provides the incentives necessary to create a financial revolution in the minds of the people around the world. With a finite amount of bitcoin, people will have an incentive to save, rather than spend. There will be much less cheap credit/malinvestment, so people won't be dissaving and living extravagant lifestyles that they're used to now on the current monopoly money system we have.
I think that individuals will have a much better understanding of sound money because of bitcoin, and therefore they will also be buying and saving more precious metals!

Yes! We already ship internationally. However there have been some recent restrictions on Asia/European shipments through companies like FedEx, so we are reevaluating our shipping options.

If the dollar stays in its current form, yes.
If you look at revolutionary technologies over the last 150 years, you see an ever increasing adoption rate:
Telephone, radio, television, the internet, and now bitcoin. Each one's adoption rate was faster than the one before.
At some point in the close future we will be playing a game of musical chairs, and the last one left with dollars will be in a world of hurt. We may lose some sales by making the switch sooner than later, but I would rather not be stuck with dollars by waiting too late.
If the coercive monopoly over the dollar ends, and it is backed by a commodity, and begins competing with other sound currencies, then we will be more than happy to continue accepting dollars after 2016.
@_date: 2014-08-27 22:31:19

After 2016.
I think that part of the press release is a bit confusing. We will not be accepting dollars and we will not be helping with the conversion from dollars to BTC. A customer would have to use a third party such as Coinbase to convert their USD to bitcoin to buy from us.
It's going to be a very different world by the end of 2016.

I think that sound money must be a commodity and have certain characteristics.
I don't think bitcoin, or any cryptocurrency, can be considered sound money right now, because they are too volatile and don't have a track record. 
However they have the potential to become sound money soon. We're all in an experiment phase for now, including Ripple. Without trial and error, and testing these different systems, we won't be able to figure out which ones are sound and which ones are not.
It is worrisome that we must trust a few individuals to tell us how many Ripples there are. I'm a big fan of decentralization and transparency, so I'm hoping Ripple will move in that direction.

A lot. The bitcoin community changed the way we do business. Because payment is instant, customers demand products instantly, so we changed the way we shipped to customers so we can ship faster and more efficiently. That means the bitcoin community has helped us improve our business for non-bitcoin customers as well.
We have also had to hire employees that can be directly attributed to bitcoin sales.
Most importantly, bitcoin has generated an optimism in me, and my employees, about the future that I have never had before.

If you live near an airport or can pick it up directly from the facility you can avoid that limit to the order.

Wow, what a comprehensive and fantastic amount of feedback. I've taken a few of these to make edits and will give some more more thought. 
Have a great day! 
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:48:19
Thanks CatoPapers! PM me your order number so I can check out your order and see if we can speed it up or add something special to it :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:50:12
Let us try again. :) Between the holidays and a systems management overhaul we haven't lived up to the ship-time goals we have set at times, but we are working everyday to improve and appreciate your feedback. PM me for a free shipping code for your next order - and thanks for visiting Amagi Metals.

BTC FTW!

We do ship to Europe! Contact our support team if you are having issues. support
@_date: 2015-01-27 23:50:25
Why thank you, sir! 
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:31:27
We already do! Top right of our website there is a drop down which shows product prices in many different currencies.
@_date: 2015-01-28 22:57:38
Not at the moment, but it has definitely been brought up. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2012-12-14 19:36:34
You can count on it! We probably won't have anything like this for at least 6 months, but check back with us.
@_date: 2012-12-14 18:06:17
Shipping prices should be very reasonable.   Thanks for the comment. Please check back! As our volume increases, our prices will decrease.
@_date: 2012-12-15 17:44:15
Thank you for checking us out and giving us positive criticism, we truly appreciate it. We currently do not have BTC prices listed on our website, however we plan on having them in the future. We currently use a third party to accept Bitcoins. This is how they calculate the exchange rate:
"To calculate the exchange rate for US Dollars, we pull up-to-the-minute BID prices from three exchanges. We take the 2 that are closest together and toss out the third, so that a bad feed from one exchange will not affect our calculation."
The price in BTC will not be displayed until after you check out I'm afraid. Hopefully we can get this changed in the future, so we do not lose customers like yourself. In the meantime, you can checkout, and if the prices aren't right for you, then you don't have to pay. Within 15 after checking out, the order will be canceled.
Our prices are much cheaper than Coinabul, comparable and in some cases cheaper than APMEX. An example of what you mean would be much appreciated. We are an official American Open Currency Standard (AOCS) dealer and we offer many of their products (John Galt, Ludwig von Mises, and Lakota rounds). The AOCS products we offer are the cheapest you'll find. Their prices are a little higher than non-AOCS products but there is an AOCS merchant center and their products are much higher quality (proofs). Feel free to send us an email, or give us a call during office hours if you have any questions.

The only reporting requirement is FinCen form 8300 when a customer pays over $10,000 in cash. This includes cash, money order, travelers check. This does not include credit card, personal check, or bank wire ($$ or BTC).
For the IRS, we just report our gross income/profit. We do not give any customer names, addresses, or purchase information.
Of course, if we receive a court mandate requiring information on a customer we are required by law to hand over the customer information. To date we have yet to receive a court mandate.

All bitcoin exchanges are MSB's as well as far as we know.
@_date: 2013-10-04 22:52:35
Maybe...but I don't think you would want to keep the old password before the hack all the same.
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:40:59
Thank you for the business guys!
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:31:00
We actually do a lot of shipping to the UK!
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:41:42
There is a delay of 14-21 days on the Freedom Girls and Slave Queens, but that should be posted on the listing before you checked out. What other variety are you looking for? We love customer suggestions.
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:16:28
BitPay can confirm.
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:02:18
International shipping needs a tracking number + insurance.

We started out selling precious metals for USD long before we started accepting bitcoins. We have only been accepting bitcoins for about 3 months. So we do a lot of volume and are able to have good prices!
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:18:08
All customers are receiving their orders. Some orders are being shipped from our warehouse and some are being shipped from our depository, so it is possible for a customer to receive an order before another customer based on what the items are.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:59:10
Super cool Roger. Thank you for making the donation!
@_date: 2013-03-30 23:53:33
We use BitPay. Highly recommended company to work with!

Thank you for the article!

Thank you, this is great stuff!

Ben is an awesome guy! Thank you for your business.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:32:20
What type of inventory are you looking for?
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:29:04
You can still buy gold &amp; silver with BTC. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:18:00
We ship internationally, but not to all countries!
@_date: 2013-04-27 20:06:39
Does APMEX, Provident, or Goldmart accept bitcoins? No. Does Provident or Goldmart ship internationally? No.
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:50:19
Thank you for the business!
@_date: 2013-07-19 22:08:48
We do handle some bitcoins directly.
@_date: 2013-07-20 02:05:46
Thank you for the suggestion!
@_date: 2013-04-27 13:18:03
We do test purity and we are part of a reputable dealer network.
@_date: 2013-04-03 23:20:16
Since bitcoins is basically paying with cash, what kind of bitcoin discounts do you give?
Do your bitcoin paying customers fill out the IRS form 8300 as most transactions are over $10,000?
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:11:45
We didn't pay for this post. You can speculate all you want about our customers, but you know what they say about people who make assumptions...
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:25:18
Funny you mention that, we are working on it as we speak!
@_date: 2013-12-27 18:49:55
Thank you for the business!
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:43:00
We use BitPay :).
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:10:46
At least you can still buy your gold with BTC.
@_date: 2013-05-30 16:30:49
Haha, sadly we do not deal with jewelry! We would love to offer the combi bars and will do so in the near future. I think we are working to offer the Suns of Liberty hand poured silver bars.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:42:24
Yes, that is correct. It is the case with most dealers currently. The Royal Canadian Mint has stopped sales, and the US Mint has restricted sales on these products, creating many product shortages currently.
@_date: 2013-05-30 01:57:08
We have bought from them before. They are awesome!
@_date: 2013-03-26 04:43:49
Congratulations! We are glad that you are our payment processor and that we are able to help contribute to your success!

Thank you for your concerns. If you are unaware, we had an unprecedented number of bitcoin orders over the Thanksgiving holiday ( More than we could have imagined! We could not be more grateful or appreciative to the bitcoin community for making this one of the most special Thanksgiving holidays that Amagi Metals has ever had.
In addition to the large number of orders, we were hit with a very large storm. The storm prevented shipments from coming in and out of Denver. Other storms hit major cities that our suppliers are located in. This also prevented us from receiving our daily bullion shipments. These storms, combined with the large number of orders has slowed down shipping from our normal 3-5 business day shipping time.
To address this we have hired additional staff. In January we are moving into a much larger warehouse/office facility. About 90% of our shipments from Thanksgiving are out the door. We are expecting to have all orders up until today out the door (with the exception of pre-ordered items) by this Friday.
At the end of the day that your order ships you will receive an automated email with the tracking information. If you have any questions, please call us at (800) 882 - 8496, M-F, 8-5pm, MST, or send us an email at support and we will respond to you within 4 business hours. Thank you for all of your support and business!

How are we acting as an MSB? We've been using BitPay since we began accepting bitcoins. We are BitPay's largest customer...
@_date: 2013-07-20 02:06:33
Thank you for the suggestion!
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:29:41
There are no taxes unless you live in the city or county of Denver as that is where we are located.
Why do you want to buy gold? If you are buying gold as an investment or hedge against inflation, its best to purchase gold as close to spot price as possible.
Higher premiums usually mean collectors items. If the shit hits the fan and gold is used as money, that premium gets wiped out. Check out our Knowledge Center for more information! 
@_date: 2013-06-13 13:29:46
Each link under the table of contents discusses certain topics. The page of links is only under "Resources," where people can go and read more about bitcoins, and "Who accepts bitcoins," which links to other companies that accept bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-17 19:14:54
We use an eCommerce platform. To accept bitcoins, we must use a BTC processing company, so we use BitPay. They deal with the software for us to accept BTC, they secure the bitcoins, automate our ordering process when payment is sent, etc.
Their fees are actually less than 3% and less than credit card fees. We are working on getting a lower fee, and even with them, we still have the lowest bullion prices for BTC :).
@_date: 2013-07-19 22:26:40
Thank you for the awesome support!
@_date: 2013-07-20 03:49:54
Actually, we do receive a portion of the sales in bitcoins from BitPay. That does not make an MSB, though.
