 once we got the seed, are we supposed to finish the puzzle without further hints from you or will you then provide new hints for the next step?

Because the address starts with a 3. This could be either bip49 (multiple accounts) or simply a SegWit address, what I believe it is because there is no reason to use a multiple accounts one. There is no way to differentiate those

Supposing that the seed can be found, what would be next step in using the  tool? . The passphrase can probably be left empty, this would be the removed step. But then we still struggle with the Derivation path. I believe we will need to use the BIP141 tab. Any suggestion about the path to use, each choice providing a full set of 3...type addresses. I don’t believe the default is enough, will need to guess it to locate the 37XTV...address an its corresponding private key

Hi to all hunters
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:49:50
Yes, maybe something like m/257

Can you please explain why having the seed means BTC would be gone. What do you do with the passphrase and derivation path? If you tell me I will reveal length of seed

Where do you see this notdef gliph? Is it in the white paper? And why do you say that in represents bitcoin, the corresponding symbol is a circle with a dot inside.

Yes! I have the seed. Hint for all: first word starts with an S and last word ends with Y.
I hope Cryptogreetings will confirm this to all to help progressing the other hunters.
Now, the removed clue nº8 is very confusing, is it really to ‘simplify’ the solution’? Please cryptogreetings clarify because  all belive it is to remove the optional passphrase. If we now try solving the derivation path and in fact a passphrase is still needed then we will guess endless. I would prefer that he keeps with the passphrase and makes this clear!

Another idea is that at least in europe dates are stated with digits separated by /
For exemple 19981101 could be 1/11/1998 so it gives derivation path m/49/0/1/11 and address 1998 in the list....

It is a bonus hint that cryptogreetings deleted after posting it. You can find it if you search on previous posts by others that were able to catch it
@_date: 2018-06-03 06:30:55
Yes but depending on passphrase and derivation path, the seed phrase will generate infinity of addresses each one with own private key...
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:08:57
Is there any way to find out what derivation path corresponds to the 37XTV....address, for exemple from the transaction or the block info? 
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:08:33
Correct me if I am wrong but an address starting with 3 is not always a m/49/...derivation path (multisig). Per  it is indicated « Until a P2SH-P2WPKH UTXO is spent and the redeemScript is exposed, a P2SH-P2WPKH address is indistinguishable from a non-segwit P2SH address (such as a non-segwit multi-signature address) ». Maybe that was the reason that the btc was moved to a new address, to spend it and be able to look at the redeemscript. Anybody familiar with redeemscripts could look at it?

Did anybody compile all of the words, numbers and symbols that are present on the image?

It is normal, as they get tired looking for ideas most leave the quest, only the real hunters remain...
