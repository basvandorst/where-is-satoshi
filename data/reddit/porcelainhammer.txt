Very helpful, thank you! Looks like is where I should stay for a while to get up to speed.

Um, what's a sticky?

I don't understand your comment.  Every major currency is depicted and each in a way that could be seen as cultish, so the only thing that singles out bitcoin in this picture is that it is portrayed as better or holier than the rest.

Slush? Gavin? Key?
I use bitcoin often and hoped to learn more about it through this thread but I never have any idea what anyone's talking about here.

I have a MacBook Pro. It's still pretty new to me so that's really all I can say.
And whatever kind of security I have, I know that it will NOTHING compared to the security of the Bitcoin protocol, so I'm more concerned about what happens when I buy bitcoin from one of these exchanges and what I am supposed to do with whatever it is that I get from that transaction.

Starting to watch it now, but what I was really wondering was this:
When you look at the private key, how many digits is it?  If I hope to store my bitcoins by writing them down somewhere I need to make sure that that would even be possible. If the private key is 1024 decimals long I need to rethink this strategy.
Second, bitcoin is remarkable in how thin you can slice it; down to one millionth I think? Well how does that affect the key that represents the bitcoin as a whole?  Hopefully that doesn't mean the key is over a million digits long....

I'm hearing a lot about private and public parts of the code that makes up a bitcoin.  This is all pretty confusing to me, but it seems like I could just write that down somewhere and store it physically, offline.
Is that possible? And is seeing bitcoin as this stream of code easy to do?
