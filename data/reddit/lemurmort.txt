I wrote papers for high school kids and made a few coins.

That's actually quite uncontroversial. 
Ever wondered why the entire continent is so fucked? There ya go

Let me know if you're considering buying, because that means it's high time to short.

Nothing talking about America waking up? Disappoint

Yea, but we'll be RICH!

Is there evidence that they're the largest holders?

I'll take credit for the Norway one. 
was there last week and drunkenly told everyone who would listen (and some who wouldn't) all about it. 
@_date: 2016-06-04 14:08:22
It made sense though. GBTC was trading at a ridiculous premium the underlying asset 
@_date: 2016-06-26 13:46:54
Come on guys. With things like this can we just tell the kids to use coinbase as a wallet and be done with it? 
For the 100 dollars he'll buy it's more than sufficient.

When I invested I was fine with losing that amount. 
Now it's up a ton and I'm not so sure

I tried to use LIFO with my BTC gains and they came back and hit me with a larger bill because I didn't use FIFO.

Why does Brazil suck so much compared to the US? On paper they started very similarly, but now they're world's apart.

Gawker stole his freedom to to privacy as a private individual. He responded in kind.

We may look back on sub thousand coins with similar eyes

Great question. I used to do this too 
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:14:24
It's funny because it's a feminist Gordian knot. 
On one hand you have women being "liberated" and "free" by being essentially hos who are selling their body. 
Simultaneously they're actually being exploited and wouldn't do this super degrading act if the patriarchy didn't coerce them into it. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 18:12:37
Who cares?

What's can't I sell
@_date: 2016-09-23 22:00:30
On mobile so I can't link, but the winky blog post on this thing convinced me this isn't a random gimic. These sort of auctions are standard in other commodity markets 
@_date: 2016-09-11 16:33:38

Now that's a business idea. Like an Uber for wenches with reviews and ratings

The composition of the team from season one was comically diverse. They added a young Muslim girl in a burqa and an old black dude. 
Have you ever been to DEFCON? Shit is almost  entirely white, mildly to grossly obese. 
@_date: 2016-09-24 11:29:11
Yea this shit is old as time

Don't break an arm jacking yourself off.

OK now they're just making shit up

I had tremendous luck last season finding whatever I needed. The quality of free streams has really improved. 
That being said if I could reliably get HD games every week for five bucks that sounds totally worth it. 
@_date: 2016-10-01 12:02:12
Don't blame shitty bureaucracy on the Brits. One of the marks of their imperial administration was that it was amazingly effective.
@_date: 2016-10-31 12:12:01
Can anyone chime in who actually uses local bitcoins? I still don't have a good mental model for when someone, especially in America, would use it 
@_date: 2016-10-15 07:18:37
What a coincidence 
@_date: 2016-10-31 22:48:56
Interesting. Thanks

Is this legal

If you want to blow money on heating just do a proper floor radiant heating system. 
Having warm floors is one of the nicer things I've ever experienced in my life.

Applications like this are just begging for Bitcoin utilization. What has taken so long?

It's there, you missed it!
@_date: 2016-05-31 03:05:06
It hurts my head that someone with the technical know-how to exploit sheep was dumb enough to do all of this. 
Does anyone know what they did to steal the coins? 
@_date: 2016-05-23 01:16:53
Guess how people buy fake ids online now. Bitcoin. 
There's so many places where it improves what's already there. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 02:23:51
So guys, how would have you unloaded these stolen coins? 
I think converting into alts then back to BTC would have been plenty to then get out via Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-07-02 21:16:33
Presumably not so much right now since they're fresh. Plus the niche of hosting another crypto head has to be worth something

I promise I'm not. This is legit one of the coolest threads I've ever read on reddit.

Better to vote for someone who might suck or might be awesome than someone you already know is totally corrupt and owned by foreign entities

@_date: 2016-07-10 03:30:54
Yea, I want to read the fuck out of your blog. Does it exist?
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:07:49
Common sense. Lots of people make a listing then never host.
@_date: 2016-07-03 18:32:21
I'm not making you any money though! Just plowing it in Vanguard 
Now I just need the military to keep me around for 15 more years and I'll be retired on easy street.

It used to be 100...now it's 200. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 16:33:32
That's my retirement fund. Not bad for a 27 year old
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:09:08
Lots of people got gox'd so we're a cynical bunch
