Measuring inflation by CPI assumes that the only element of inflation is consumer pricing that isn’t the case
For example say a new piece of tech is invented that makes many of the products in the CPI basket cheaper to manufacture the CPI would say there was deflation despite no change in money and its purchasing power only some products getting cheaper so to unrelated phenomena
This in fact happens all of the time meaning real inflation is far higher than the CPI would suggest if you measure how many labor hours/capital use hours money can buy as opposed to finished products as products constantly cost less labor and capital to produce thanks to technological advances
As for what measure I would use I think the only measure is the amount of money in circulation (M1 M2 and M3)

LOL this is such a simple issue the standard investopedia article is enough since you clearly haven’t read anything beyond that level on how the CPI is calculated but just in case you ever get interested to read the BLS description (the same just not written in as easy language) with more boring details (like how they choose what stores to measure prices in) here’s the BLS page

I didn’t get the velocity wrong I know what it means I disagree with what the standard model claims it does I did not claim velocity of money meant the speed it reached the market I argued that velocity of money would effect the speed it hit the market you should learn reading comprehension it’ll also help you when you try reading what the CPI so you don’t have to look so stupid when you claim it is “just a thermometer”

All money is used to buy stuff (yes even investments cost money) velocity effects how long it takes for it to enter the market and bid up other products but virtually no money is just not in circulation
As for the CPI again in 1900 it was much harder to bake a loaf of bread if it costed the exact same amount today that would be inflation and the CPI would say it didn’t inflate

Dude the CPI is calculated by a weighted basket of products which leaves out prices that should have gone down 
BTW when is the last time you read any Econ book never mind a direction of the CPI? (I listen to audiobooks on Econ almost daily)

I’m well aware of what the standard models claim velocity does I’m saying it is incorrect because simple supply/demand curves say that more supply = less value per unit I am saying that I do agree that it can have an effect on the speed of equilibrium being reached but to claim that money (or anything else) can have its supply increased without having its value effected ever directly defies basic Econ laws like what every 8th grader knows and yes I’m well aware that modern neo kensyians deny this obvious observation
As for the CPI google is your friend it is calculated by a basket of products and services and how much the basket costs in nominal dollars it does not control for how much the products should have gone down due to technical advancements in say bread baking this isn’t controversial just read it on the BLS website

No it isn’t, CPI measures a basket of products and their over the counter cost it does not measure the cost it took for those products to be made
CPI measures price inflation not monetary inflation
If the cost of all of the products in the CPI basket stay the same inflation is measured at zero even if it double the amount of good can now be made with the same capital/labor
As for money supply increased money supply IS inflation (though it can take time for it to trickle down) for the simple reason that there are more dollars competing for the same products
Post 2008 much of the new money created went into gov debt (state local and federal) which which means the flow to the actual price market is much slower due to how slow governments work but every new dollar printed is eventual inflation

If it a loaf of bread costs less to make than buying it for the same price is inflation because the reason you are paying that same price is because your money is less valuable CPI doesn’t measure that therefore it is a bad metric
As for money supply/inflation this is simple logic the more of something there is the less valuable it is more money by definition means less valuable money otherwise known as inflation

Yeah it’s inflation as measured by the government which has a very stupid way of measuring inflation
