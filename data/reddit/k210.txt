As a australian bitcoin user myself i can say coinjar and btcmarkets are the best choice

Sure whatever helps you sleep at night

what does blackcoin have that peercoin doesnt? 
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:24:08
did i strike a nerve? 
@_date: 2016-01-01 12:44:51
Peercoin rewards people who run full nodes through a process called minting. In peercoin the full nodes control the network not the miners.

anyone who accepts btc thanks to shapeshift lens

Bull market when we cross $20,000

Coin supply will probably have to be increased in the long run
@_date: 2015-09-27 14:15:07
How would you back up such a argument?
@_date: 2017-05-19 11:04:39
Best to stay away from bitcoin for now. Once this rally dies down price will crash due to pissed off users....
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:41:59
looks good will try with a small deposit
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:23:15
its not about difficulties but rather how streamlined the bitcoin process is. With paypal i would have to: 
- Login
- Pay transaction fee(Depending)
- Have funds avaliable, if not do bank wire 
- Click through multiple pages
- Hit pay and hope no errors occur 
With bitcoin 
- Send bitcoin to address generated
- done (No need to wait for blockchain confirmation)
You be the judge which is easier and more user friendly 
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:27:55
Actually no. If you look at past BTC crashes selling pressure increases as price decreases. 
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:42:43
i try to avoid local bitcoins because the price is normally 10-20% above the market price
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:53:43
In the future bitcoin holdings will be measured in satoshis not giant decimal chunks like now
@_date: 2017-05-04 07:53:34
Because it is easy to use
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:24:18
did you even read what i wrote?
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:26:44
When BTC was $1200 in 2013 people used to say that is would never dip below $1000 again. Then when price hit $220 in 2015 most people dumped their coins instead of holding. Point is that people know to buy low and sell high but few people have the balls to actually do it. 
BTW i have been in crypto since late 2013.

their refund system does not support any payment system at all. Refunds are paid to your steam balance not the processor you paid with
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:02:26
Because your holdings would decline in value
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:04:02
There is nothing wrong with sticking to satoshis original vision. He envisioned a network that is decentralised and secure and that is exactly what we should strive to be. 
I dont get what you have against satoshi...
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:19:46
i dont think you have ever had your paypal account frozen or else you would be singing a different tune. As for credit cards they are very inefficient compared to bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-23 08:20:04
works anywhere in the world
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:17:02
No what i am trying to day is that if crypto succeeds in the long run than the fiat value will no longer matter. In short 1 LTC will always be 1 LTC. 
Satoshi did not create bitcoin and by extension altcoins so they could complement fiat, no his vision was to replace the fiat system altogether. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:48:25
Yep. That is the entire point of bitcoin to break free of fiat and create a economy based entirely on BTC. If you believe in the underlying tech then weather the price is $0.01 or $100000 does not matter. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 08:29:04
long term holders tend to make the most profit
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:14:21
Well think about who actually uses litecoin. You can have the best tech in the world but if it is not widely used then the price will not go up. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:31:18
As a long term follower of bitcoin i am happy this massive price reduction is happening. It will shift focus back onto bitcoin as a whole rather than being seen by outsiders and speculators as some money making machine. 
Price went up too fast for its own good. As of right now i would not put the real non-hyped price of bitcoin anywhere above $1000. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:46:10
If there is no demand just how will it bounce back?
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:41:26
Only if bitcoin becomes the sole worldwide currency
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:48:09
Yep. That is the entire point of bitcoin to break freak of fiat and create a economy based entirely on BTC. IF you believe in the underlying tech then weather the price is $0.01 or $100000 does not matter.

Never underestimate the stupidity of some crypto investors. Always copy others unable to think for themselves....
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:38:26
Ahh i remember those days....
