Lol he just sees it how it is.
Bitcoin is inferior to quite a few others...it won't be king much longer if the market decides to embrace sanity...
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:17:03
Wait...lightning network centralizes bitcoin? Would you explain?
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:32:59
How so?
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:54:25
Lol wat?
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:39:18
I don't know any counter arguments actually. Every time I ask why bitcoin should be worth..anything...I get ZERO response from anyone, or, like in this thread, I get down voted for even questioning bitcoin. No one can explain why btc is king other than first mover advantage...and that's not going to last long.
Once people start to realize how inefficient and expensive bitcoin actually is to use...they are going to start selling. You have to realize you guys spend most of your time in an echo chamber....you've all drank the koolaid and it doesn't matter what happens...you're going to believe in bitcoin...but you need to realize that the vast majority of bitcoin holders don't feel the same way. They are capable of looking at bitcoin subjectively...something you lot seem incapable of.
@_date: 2018-01-04 23:34:22
How is it a scam? Genuinely curious.
Anytime I ask about it in this sub I get downvoted....when I ask why they hate Bitcoin in r/btc, I get downvoted.
You guys all want to shit on each other but you won't explain your reasoning...
@_date: 2018-01-07 01:16:01
Bitcoin is what...almost 10 years old now? How long do we give it a pass for "being new tech"?
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:05:34
I'll just repost this.
You can't be that stupid...can you? If you sell at every ATH, then buy back in during each proceeding dip...you're going to have far more BTC than if you just held on to it.
You don't even have to time the dips just right...as long as you buy back in at a lower price than you sold then you are profiting.
I don't understand how this confuses you people. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:43:55
Idgaf. I'm being attacked by a bunch of salty fat fucking nerds...of course I'm not going to be kind to them.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:38:01
You've been in crypto since 2013 and you did your trading on coinbase...? Not even GDAX...just coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:14:19
Are you having a heart attack? You should of known that morbid obesity would catch up with you at some point.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:16:54
If I had even 20k to start trading with I WOULD be a millionaire...but unfortunately I come from an incredibly poor background. I've done very well for myself considering what I started with.
It's incredibly simple...sell it for more than you bought it for...then buy back in if it dips.... if you can't do that then I'm sorry you're an idiot. You really don't need to be a jealous little bitch about it though.
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:54:51
Cool? I've been waiting two weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:03:17
It's not about predicting what a price will do, it's about predicting what people will do.
A lot of people have made a lot of money using charts to day trade. Is the method always accurate? No, of course not. But it IS accurate often enough to find success with it.
Anyone saying otherwise is either uneducated or uninterested in helping others learn to do what they can do.
Wall street has long enjoyed a mystique that enables them to pretend the stock market is a very confusing thing that you are better off just giving them your money and letting them invest for you.
Unfortunately for them, that is a lie and anyone who wants to take the time can learn everything they need to learn to be a successful trader.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:48:12
I've already explained...i have some that I just hold. But I have a small amount that I day trade with. If I miss a jump from 15 to 20k, oh well, I still made a profit. I'll wait for the market to settle (or jump on if it shows no signs of slowing) buy back and and start over again. To assume there will never be another dip again is pretty retarded...but even if there wasn't, I wouldn't actually lose any money.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:11:56
You obviously suck donkey dick at math.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:52:24
Jesus you people are sad.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:50:00
Good idea...I'll put all of you sad fat little fucks on mine as well. And every time I make a successful trade, I'll look at your pathetic little crying and laugh.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:15:06
AGAIN (since reddit is getting straight up bombarded with gemini posts), there is absolutely no way I can use Gemini to day trade until they get some real charts. Those silly toys r us kids charts are unacceptable.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:38:18
Most of the 1% are fucking morons born into money. They have done nothing but LOSE money since they inherited it.
Do you know how completely fucking EASY it is to make money when you already have money? 
That vast majority of rich people I mentioned...yeah their IQ's are probably lower than 100.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:28:53
How tough? Or stupid? This is the beginning of the end for this useless tech. Alt coins are the future...bitcoin is dying. Fast. Wait for a little bump back to approximately 15k then get out before it's too late. Invest in some coins that actually have real world value.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:33:59
Lol you must be the saddest little virgin I've found on the internet...
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:37:45
Because it's not hard if you don't try to time it perfectly. If you don't get greedy it's just not that difficult. It's low right now...so I can buy some more, and sell it when it makes it back to 15k within a week or two.
Is there a chance that one of these days it's NOT going to recover after it dips? Absolutely...but if that's your concern just siphon your profit out each time.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:03:19
You can't be that stupid...can you? If you sell at every ATH, then buy back in during each proceeding dip...you're going to have far more BTC than if you just held on to it.
You don't even have to time the dips just right...as long as you buy back in at a lower price than you sold then you are profiting.
I don't understand how this confuses you people. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:11:03
I'll give you an example moron.
I bought in at 9k, sold at 16k after it started to drop after hitting 17k. Bought back in at 14k, sold at 17k, bought back in at 12k, sold at 15k. Etc...etc...
I now hold far more BTC than I would if I would of just "holdr derrrr!!"
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:40:09
Cryptocurrency doesn't play by the same rules as stocks.
The reason day traders can beat holders is because there is so much volatility. This volatility doesn't exist in the stock market.
Stop trying to apply stock market rules to cryptocurrency markets...they aren't the same.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:43:16
Lmao. You don't have to be smart to buy it at 13k then sell it at 15k...then buy it again at 12k and sell it at 14k.
I'm not smart...I'm a dumb jock and I have been very successful. That's my point you fat fuck. When there is this much volatility in a market...It's not difficult to profit and you don't need to be some super genius.
Is it going to work forever? Of course not...but it's highly effective right now.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:43:47
The ultimate douche.
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:49:50
That's why I do both. I've made more than I would of doing just one. Period.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:15:01
Oh wow. Math is not your strong suit...
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:05:05
Again, Gemini's interface is sooo basic and simple. There's no way I'm going to trade there until they get some big boy charts.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:26:18
Lol 
You guys don't understand basic math...that's fine. I'll keep selling high and buying if/when it dips and profiting.
Why would I stop doing something that has made me FAR more money than just holding? Because some sad, fat, lonely, salty redditors who lost a bunch of money day trading, are trying to say, "waaahhhh! If I can't do it then NO one can!"?
I really don't care...if you guys can't do it then don't do it...but to sit there and try to scare other people away from it is pretty fucked up.
It works for me and I'm a dumb jock. It works for many other people as well. Sorry you can't do it...but that doesn't mean it's impossible little guy.
Stop trying to apply stock market rules to the cryptocurrency market...they aren't the same. Period.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:12:09
So what? I still made a profit. This is what I meant by play it safe and don't get greedy.
Of course I still hold some from when I bought in at 9k so that will always rise with the price.
If I miss out on a jump from 15 to 17 k with my day trading funds..oh well...Ill just wait for the market to settle a bit, find it's new rhythm, and buy back in.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:38:55
Wait...did you just claim that you could look at charts and see that 19k is ath...and decide that it's not a good time to buy based on...GASP...past performance????!?!?
I just got into a huge argument with a bunch of beckbeards who got burned day trading and now vehemently attack anyone who claims it's possible to make reasonably accurate predictions on btc price based on past performance.
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:58:10
Many people, myself included, have made a lot of money day trading based on the charts. 
You see...we aren't predicting what the price will do, we are predicting what people will do. Man is a creature of habit...we are simple and predictable.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:08:49
Which explains why they're all so confused by selling high and buying back in when it's low.
"Nooo!! Derrr@ it's impossible to know if it's low or high at any given moment cuz charts are lies!!"
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:42:09
Lol if you're still confused then I give up. I have more BTC now then I did when I started...but i haven't spent any extra money. How on earth you could think this is the result of bad trades really blows my mind. It seems like every once in awhile someone shows me that people can be even more stupid than I thought. This is one of those days.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:24:44
Why would you have to time it perfectly? As long as you are selling higher than you bought, and buying back in when it dips again...you are increasing the number of BTC you have.
It's really not complicated...a basic understanding of math is really all you need to grasp this...
I am blown away by how uneducated you people are...
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:46:57
Tradingview.com has a ton of great information from chart analysts. Good place to start.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:33:52
The vast majority of rich people are completely out of touch with reality and it shows in their everyday behavior and mannerisms. They seem "off" to the 99% of us who live in "the real world".
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:40:48
I just signed up for Gemini and those charts are so basic....there's no way I'm going to do any trading on that website unless they get a real interface.
