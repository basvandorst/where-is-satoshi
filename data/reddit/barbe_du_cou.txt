nothing you said contradicts what i said.  they're interested in using blockchain as a ledger for traditional money transfers between banks.  they're not interested in supporting a new currency, so it doesnt matter how long bitcoin has been around or interacting in networks run out of individuals.  they are interested in other banks getting on board and forming a network between those entities.  it takes a long time because any business like a bank has a significant amount at stake and will want to research several aspects of such a proposal including cost, security, and the legal/regulatory climate.
