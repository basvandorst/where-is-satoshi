These taxes are paid in USD. The capital gains law's unit of value is the USD. So any currency/commodity is converted into relative USD for taxation calculations. This reflects a change for everything except the USD, since the value of the USD is always equal to $1.00.

As with any investment....it is % gained or lost that is important. Invest $1000 in BTC @ $100 each, or invest $1000 in BTC @ 5000 each, if the price goes up 10 percent you have $1100. The relativistic value to USD or other currency/commodity is irrelevant. 
That said...you are too late to catch % gains that have happened in the past. But the market is still open and growing...so, you can jump in and not miss future gains...or not jump in and lose/gain nothing.

I see arguments for valuation and limiting supply. So, please explain how you determine the value of the USD and explain how it is not an unlimited supply currency. Then, I will translate into BTC. 
The USD, as with most currencies, has no intrinsic value. It's relative value fluxuates along side commodities and other currencies (fait and crypo alike). The USD is not backed by anything other than trust and flimsy relativistic valuations. The treasury is constantly issuing new physical notes, and digital incarnations of the USD exist in such abundance that the physical notes pale in comparison. So, it clearly has no real value and the supply is growing, unchecked, every second.
And we don't even need to relate the concept of alt coins to new governments and their issuance of new currencies. Or defeated governments and the vanishing of their currencies.

It says BTC dropped $100 yesterday as a result of yet another Chinese utterance...that's only a 2-3% fluctuation. That's a stable day in crypto. Who keeps posting this crap?

I would say that you debated the point beautifully....though I'm afraid you may have proven the counterpoint rather than your own. Social consensus didn't hold true (because it was a manipulated concensus). The fact that consensus was allowed to be manipulated, and the fact that consensus is fully divided now a few days later are both solid evidence that true social consent is not highly regarded by Bitcoiners. I say this because you appear to be one who appreciates the art of well informed and well formed debate. I offer it as constructive criticism rather than choosing sides....because, short of its correlating effect upon the crypto market, I couldn't care less about Bitcoin or its hierarchical squabbles.

We have different ideas of what a working consensus is. For me a true working consensus is able to remain in place over time with little or no dissent. The whole idea of cosensus is to ensure that the entire group is in accord and ready to comply. If a small party manipulates consensus through misinformation or manipulation, then that consensus will not hold and is not a really true group consent. 
Yes a group managed to get segwit activated. But, the coerced consent which enabled this, clearly did not have the ability to hold up once the dissenting faction was given strong voice and support. If a consensus doesn't actually reflect the wants and needs of the entire group, then it is not a consensus ceases to hold any power. Consensus is not like democratic legislation.

Got me...sorry I missed that you were referencing Segwit and read it as Segwit2x. I blame it on a bit of recent lead poisoning which has left me a bit fuzzy...though I might have misread it even if my cognition weren't temporarily impaired. I yeild the floor.
