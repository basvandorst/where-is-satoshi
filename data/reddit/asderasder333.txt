its my understanding from previous news about this, that they have not sold their coins, so how can they lose money? 
with ipo money, they just have to wait next bull run.
@_date: 2018-08-30 01:05:10

@_date: 2018-08-27 00:03:26
why cant access? they only need to switch miners from btc to bch and btc will fall a part, hole system becomes to a stop if so much hashing power suddenly dissapears. and boom, now only bcash works.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:01:14

with renting you can always move, they indeed want you to buy/lease a house so you be stuck there for next 20-30yrs . 
with renting you may move to better country, so this one loses you, hell you may get weird ideas to see the world and travel before death, and when renting you can do these things.
