actually read through most of that.
guy starts working with amazon a few months prior to the kindle fire release\launch, notices a whole bunch of stupid things being done within the company and the launch, figures out some solutions to said launch stupidity, but the higher ups do a lot of denying and ignoring. well the launch doesn't go to well, there are some glitches in the software, they went over the budget, which the guy noticed far in advance but no one wanted to do anything.
in the end, because he was right, and peoples pride and ego were hurt they started turning on him, he tries to transfer, goes to HR and discuss this, turns out Mr. HR is friends with his current boss, HR blabs and the arthur gets put on blast by his boss and put on a 12month no transfer policy.....and then my brain goes blank but im pretty sure he got fired.

cant you send some small amounts, like maybe a few and encrypt a message in them linking to this post?
and maybe also spam your public address here incase he just googles your address instead of checking for a message.

relevant part starts at 8 seconds in. Instant payment to other people.
not siding against bitcoin but it doesn't seem like it would be too hard for banks and other payment processors to implement a speedy exchange system into there system, like the one shown in the video. At least bitcoin still has everyone beat on fee's for each transaction.

I don't think it went through.
@_date: 2013-09-03 02:21:04
