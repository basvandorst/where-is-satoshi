The fact that I have to explain it to you means you have rocks in your head. 
To get their best rewards card(black) you have to give them(stake) 50,000MCO. They are currently valued at 4.50USD. That is 225,000USD you have to give the card issuer to receive a credit card. Their other color card are cheaper. If their business model makes money why do they need to hold ours? Mark my words, at some point in the future people will not be able to withdrawer their stakes.
They mention Spotify, Netflix, Expedia and Airbnb on their website. Makes it look legit right? In fine print at the bottom of the page " **\*\*\*This offer is launched by Crypto.com independently and there is no partnership between Crypto.com and the merchants in this offer. Crypto.com has the sole discretion to modify this offer at any time.** "
They have no partnerships with anyone.
Good luck to anyone that sends them money.

The real cost is getting money in and out of Bitcoin. I send a large amount of international SWIFT payments. If I choose to use Bitcoin I would loose 5% buying the Bitcoin and the vendor would loose another 5% converting back to their local currency. The other fees would be trivial. If we all started transacting in Bitcoin these conversion would be redundant. START USING IT AS A CURRENCY NOW.

I was replying to the OPs question about about segwit2x. I did not recommend BCH and am not a big blocker. I do however agree with the majority of level headed people that a small increase in needed now. Can we please stop the two camps. BCH are gone and good luck two them. There are multiple good ways to scale and we need a multi pronged approach. Refusing the compromise this is Segwit2x will only cause another split.

If you are really worried, open another bank account for using on Bisq. You don't need to give your name. Only your account number to receive the deposit. I have used Bisq a number of times and love it. Almost zero fees. Only problem is not enough people using it in Australia. Come on people.

Setup you Trezor with seed, passphrase and pin. Leave ledger as is.
Plug in Ledger and Trezor to PC. Both at the same time. Unlock Ledger. Open Electrum and create new wallet. Choose multisig 2 of 2. It will ask about the first signer. Choose hardware wallet and select the Ledger. Next it will ask about the second signer choose hardware wallet and then Trezor. At this point you will need to unlock the Trezor with pin and your passphrase setup earlier. Now your wallet will be created. Feel free to PM me with further questions. Good luck. Do you have a Nodl?

Been here since 2012. Can't agree with the OP more. I'd like to add, the tech is improving so quickly at the moment. We have the best development team in the world. Rootstock, lightning. This shit is amazing. Our percentage of the crypto market cap is super strong at 54%. I don't believe any crypto can overtake bitcoin ever.... Not advice, but I'm buying. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 08:43:01
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:45:31
Big question. I would recommend some reading. Over simplified answer. A lightning enabled wallet will have two accounts. Your mainnet account(bank account) and your lightning account(debit/credit card). You will transfer a couple of hundred from your mainnet account to your lightning account to use for spending at shops. They are different networks and use different addresses. Mind Games accepts both mainnet and lightning transactions. A mainnet payment will cost a few Australian cents. A lightning payment will cost 1/100th of a cent.

Tencent, China's biggest tech company is is partnering with Acchain. It's a crypto backed by Bitcoin and linked to the IMFs SDR. Tencent would not be involved unless the government was behind it.

The shrilling is so obvious it's hilarious. Somewhere there is a small room of people with hundreds of reddit accounts. Judging by the hours they are posting I think it's in Australia. My guess and it's only a guess is that it's Craig Wright. He has the BTC to dump on the market while pumping BCHSV. 1m of them he stole from Hal Finney. Also it all started three weeks ago when his shit fork failed. And he's a narcissist. He should go choke on his own dick.

Windows -&gt; Windows -&gt; Windows. MySpace and Digg were never as dominant as Windows or Bitcoin and certainly not for as long. Also as open source software it is upgraded with countless more improvements much faster. It will take a miracle to overtake. Also the users are more important than the software. Betamax was better than VHS. Didn't mater as users has already spent money on VHS machines and tapes. Same with bitcoin.

Just buy Bitcoin! 98% of alts are worthless. If one business saying your business/coin is worthless and then it becomes worthless then is WAS worthless to begin with.

The problem it solves is not relying on one company's product to secure your funds. Vulnerabilities have been found with both the Trezor and the Ledger over the years. Also, if either company choose to push out a firmware update with a backdoor to steal your Bitcoin you will still be protected by the bitcoin networks multisig. Both companies would have to collude which is much more unlikely.

I'm trying to setup a 2 of 2 wallet with one Trezor and one Ledger. Bech32 multisig with Electrum. When trying to receive BTC to the wallet I first hit the show on Trezor button to see the public address on the Trezor and confirm it. Trezor displays "Wrong address path for selected coin. Continue at your own risk!" If I continue the address shows on the Trezor with a path m/48'/0'/0'/2'/0/0. If I send funds to the address they seem to be received in the wallet fine. Then when I try to send funds from the wallet to another external address I get an error on the ledger this time, saying it does not like the change address. This time the change path it doesn't like is m/48'/0'/0'/2'/1/1. If I proceed everything also seems fine, with the transfer sent and the change back in my wallet. Any idea why the Trezor and Ledger are not liking the receiving and change addresses from Electrum? I want to send more BTC to the wallet but am very concerned that both HW wallets are giving errors with this setup.
Many people online recommended this multisig setup. Googling m/48'/0'/0'/2'/1/1 and m/48'/0'/0'/2'/0/0 I get almost nothing. I can't be the first person with this setup and these errors?
In the past I also use Sentinel on Android with my Trezor Xpub so I can monitor the balance of my wallet and generate in public addresses to receive BTC to my Trezor when I am out and about.
When I setup the multisig wallet in Electrum I was given a master Zpub for the wallet. Sentinel will not accept the Zpub and says it invalid. Any idea how I can get the wallet to show on Sentinel or any other mobile app?
Thanks for any advice in advance.

I don't like that it's not a private company. Or a public one for that matter. I'm just saying that people should not compare it to one. It's a protocol with users that think it's a private investment. There has never been anything similar prior to bitcoin.

Not advocating btc/fiat CCs however should someone have held the 20-30k buffer they usually hold in fiat in btc instead in most cases cases over the last nine years they would have been better off. Even with loosing ~3% changing back to fiat with a CC where needed. Also promoting merchants to accept btc directly along the way. If everyone had done so we would be living in a free open source society now and the CCs that got us here would now be obsolete.
