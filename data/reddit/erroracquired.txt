I went through 2 long term power outages from within the USA. 1st was an ice storm in kentucky about 10 years ago. We were out of power for 14 days, but neighbors banded together and we did just fine with generators and canned food. Water was the biggest issue, and being thirsty sucks bad (no one will know this until going through it)
2nd time was in New York for Hurricane Sandy. It was a very abnormal weather system that slammed my area and destroyed the Jersey Shore Boardwalk (a place that I visited with family every year) We were out **of power** for 11 days, things were not as calm as they were in KY. 
People became quite frantic. Gas stations had lines extending miles into highways causing more traffic delays and more people running out of gas. Stranded vehicles, hospitals with no water/power for patients... the list GOES ON.  Towards the end we decided as a family not to answer the door as groups of board teens/young adults with dead cell phones in their hands were roaming around creating trouble and stealing. We do have firearm protection so I was not concerned, however we were the only apartment on the block with lights and cell phones working. I charged many cell phones of trusted neighbors every single day off my solar panels and my vehicle DC/AC Inverter. 
They were not ready. They are still not ready. ***I am ready.*** 
I have a full solar system setup with deep cycle marine batteries and a pantry full of military MRE's with expiration dates around 2030. Dont forget the water, amazon sells so many water filtration devices for super cheap. Everyone should own one. you could drink the water from a mud puddle! 
EDIT: just some spelling

just fingers crossed, I'm in for the fun of it :) its a wild ride!
I definitely only invested what I was willing to loose 
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:33:35
November/December is just around the corner now and we all know what happened last year...
@_date: 2018-06-14 15:54:33
Ill be sure to reply back to this when it skyrockets, See ya then...maybe!
I just have no confidence in your opinion, at all. Also some of the dumbest/strongest willed/difficult people I have ever dealt with were the ones that started our convo by saying how much school they completed (schooling is highly overrated and works as a negative for me)
I see bitcoin vending machines popping up in my area, also noticed some popping up in other countries. I see more friends/family/coworker talking more about bitcoin. ***I invested solely on the expected grown of bitcoin as a whole NOT the expected value.***
I also only invested what I am willing to loose
EDIT: I mean no offense, I dont want this to come off wrong, good day to you

Exposure baby, keep it coming! 
Thanks for sharing. I love folowing the rise of bitcoin in America. My local family owned breakfast deli down the road from my job just installed an BITCOIN ATM!
The popularity is soaring, and I got my popcorn awaiting the price to soar! We all know what happened last November... 
An excerpt: 
However, the ruling made Wednesday by the Supreme Court has confirmed stocks do not count as "money remuneration" and the case should be "remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion," according to majority opinion issued Thursday.
The dissenting opinion, drafted by the 79-year-old associated justice Stephen Breyer and backed by Justices Ginsburg, Sotomayor and Kagan, argues that the nature of what constitutes "money" is less rigid than the majority's interpretation, noting that "what we view as money has changed over time."
That's a notable argument coming from the more conservatively minded Supreme Court, setting the stage for what is the first reference to bitcoin in a U.S. Supreme Court ruling.
Breyer wrote:
"Moreover, what we view as money has changed over time. Cowrie shells once were such a medium but no longer are ... our currency originally included gold coins and bullion, but, after 1934, gold could not be used as a medium of exchange... Perhaps ***one day employees will be paid in bitcoin or some other type of cryptocurrency.***

Its intreging to me that the bitcoin 'ATM' machines are poping up everywhere! One opened in my hometown inside a tiny family owned deli. 
I was in line to check out when I overheard other customers in the store talkin about how surprised they were to see this machine. They said something like "well looks like bitcoin is the way of the future" another said "I though bitcoin was to buy illegal merchandise online". They were educating themselfs about bitcoin right in front of me. One of them went over and used the machine to buy his first amount. 
Lots of positive talk that day by randoms... all due to this machine. Its clear to me that many people are just uneducated about it, but that seems to be changing
This is a picture that I personally took of it

very Very COOL, spread you wings lil bitcoins
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:55:35
No one knows, except time travelers :)
@_date: 2018-06-21 18:32:02
I cant wait to visit the first vending machine in my area where I can buy something with bitcoin. I think its only a matter of time now. New ATM to buy bitcoin opened in a little corner deli right next to me last month
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:49:35
Im going to stick to Reddit Bitcoin subreddit because I can access it at any one of my desks/offices at work. Keep them ATM pics coming, Ill upvote them like always
@_date: 2019-12-13 16:03:16
Well done OP, WELL DONE
I pay for my Kratom and Marijuana using bitcoin all the time.. its been years now. But I want to buy more things with it! I want it to become more mainstream. Let me give an example. out of 10 people that I work with, all tech savvy, only 1 of them participates in bitcoin, that 1 person is me. We need more exposure, and that is what OP is doing here. Upvote upvote upvote from me :)
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:55:52
Exactly. Its an amazing time to be alive!
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:22:28
Please do share. My work approves certain website access and google-search is not supported. however, send me what you got and Ill try it out. Let me know how I can find ATM pop up pictures across the world in a single spot like this one, I am very eager to hear your response
@_date: 2019-12-30 17:39:25
I enjoy the ATM posts
I like to see where they are popping up
Cant you (OP) just avoid clicking on the ATM posts to view them? I dont feel like they should be censored or whatever OP is proposing
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:28:31
I completely agree with everything you stated. Go spacex and nasa!
@_date: 2018-07-23 12:57:23
wait so I can buy stuff with bitcoin at stores like home depot now?
I am fairly new, I just invested 300 bucks a few months ago at 6k. My plan is to not touch the money until after bitcoin explodes (I believe it will just like last November/December) 
@_date: 2018-07-20 14:18:18
I cant wait for bitcoin to skyrocket but I am a very patient guy. Acquiring major retailer support is a major step. Reminds me when Home Depot started offering PayPal in-store!
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:25:02
negative, they do not. Very old fashioned, older owners. I suspect someone from the outside "convinced" them to put it in their store. Must be a profit sharing or some percentage goes to the store. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 20:30:16
I'm 40 min outside of NYC, reside in NJ. Def my first encounter. People that were in the store were speaking about bitcoin in a positive light as if them seing this machine was a window into the future. Love it. Hodl.
@_date: 2018-04-27 21:24:44
Ill attempt to use it Monday and will let you know, I had to report back to work
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:42:20
loving this ride! its fun. Wonder what it will be late December cuz we all know what happened last year
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:29:44
come to find out... this person invested their entire 401K!
