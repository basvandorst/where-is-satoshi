If someone figures out a way to mess with the blockchain, that would crash the value. I also think when giant Bitcoin exchanges get hacked it will affect the price. Overall you are still right the risk is near none existing but nonetheless it exists.

I think something is cooking. Someone is trying to cause a catastrophe in bitcoin so it doesn't compete with the USD.

I was just pointing out that these events can affect the price of Bitcoin.
[Exchange Forced Crash](
Blockchain Forced Crash has yet to happen because bitcoin was so cheap when it last happened. But you think a bug that created  184,467,440,737.09551616 Bitcoin won't be used by Wallstreet to scare people who don't understand Bitcoin and forks?
[Government Forced Crash]( can be easily done in the U.S. WallStreet can lobby for some bs regulation on Bitcoin and crash its price.
I can keep going but there are too many risks that can be taken advantage of to short Bitcoin. That's my main point.

The problem is that we haven't moved away from nonrenewable energies. This entire thread is ignorant as balls. Bitcoin is a great innovation but at the same time it created a huge environmental problem. Don't even get me started on the toxic waste it creates as mining equipment becomes outdated which doesn't even take that long to happen. I seen hardware grave yards in China, that shit ain't no joke. The best course of action is to keep this quiet and don't debate it at all. We all know Bitcoin harms the environment but there are bigger fish to fry out there and we should be tackling that first. Please don't defend the effects Bitcoin has on the environment as this is just plain ignorant.
Edit: provided some more information regarding Bitcoin's energy usage. It's hard to calculate the environmental impact of Bitcoin. So my statement might exaggerate the impact Bitcoin has on the environment.

Np for the heads up xD. I will read the links you provided me when I get home. Thanks for taking the time to do this. You are a cool dude.

You named my source &gt;.&gt;
Oh great old guy brings up entitlement. Please tell me what we are entitled to because it looks like your generation  made sure there wasn't anything left for our [generation to benefit from]( I included a link hopefully you know how to scroll down, have a modern browser and not windows xp /w ie9.

I don't care what some old dbag thinks as well. Old people who will die before climate change starts to get bad don't have much interest in finding out if something harms the enviroment. Won't even post his sources because there are none. Yet you called out De Vries' article without sources.

Link or gtfo. Baseless statements don't mean much to me.

These "professional traders" are about to find out that bitcoin holders are big ass bulls.

The one sad thing about Bitcoin is that you guys refuse to accept normal economic rules.

I mined in 2010 and I'm still broke.
@_date: 2018-06-01 01:06:16
I'm here because I want to know bitcoin news that will affect the price. The price is also news to me...
@_date: 2019-01-31 14:40:47
I’m sure those mining graveyards don’t do anything to the environment /s

I hope young developers know that some people get lucky with that "I got it!" moment. I know great developers who started coding 2 years ago. Being 16 years old just meant you had the resources available to you the whole time and/or got the "I got it!" lottery really quick.
