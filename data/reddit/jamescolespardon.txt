Scroll up - never once have I denounced capitalism in this thread.

If the capitalist model is defined as 'profits over people', and when coupled with the fraudulent fractional reserve, Private Federal Reserve Bank, leads to the concentration of wealth to constantly trickle up - then you're damn right I'm against it.

Just switch your details and you'll be up to date with the current alternative hypothesis.

With a name that combines congress and econ, I'm not surprised.


The opposite of progress is congress.

It's always capitalism vs communism eh? 
@_date: 2014-11-23 17:55:50
So true.

I'm not going ho about anything, despite any preconceived notions you have about me.


I am merely pointing out that the systems in place now benefit the stupidly rich at the expense of the rest of the population, and this is agreed upon by most (at least around here in r/bitcoin...)


Nowhere did I ever say this. Really?


Surely there could possibly be something better? And if not, maybe if we eliminated central banking and an inherently fraudulent fractional reserve system, and eliminate the incentives towards buying politicians with this fraudulent capital, something more fair for 99% of the population could emerge? I can hope, can't I?

That's what they want to you think, bro!
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:56:22
Or downvoted.

I didn't appoint these people. Who am I going to vote for? Someone whose ideals match those of the 99% of us who are not millionaires, who are not beholden to multinational corporations for campaign financing to keep their jobs? I'd love to see them on my national ballots.
Who did you vote for last time for President? Which one of two old, rich guys (hey, at least I can't say 'rich white guys' anymore right? That's progress!)
And good on you for being active in student government. Keep that up - we are going to need a lot more of you if this place is going to change for the better any time soon. But do yourself a favor and educate yourself more on the inherent flaws of central banks in government, and the havoc they have wrought since establishing power in the late 1600s.

So Wall Street's record profits of the past few years should correlate with unemployment decreases, right?

...and I just realized that we're living in Idiocracy. I thought it was coming, but it is already here.
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:47:02
You could argue that I purposefully didn't include it, hoping someone woudl call me out. I'm glad it didn't take long :)

It's not fine, regardless of whether or not they are doing it. It's only fine because we're too distracted with our Facebook, Twitter, this stupid iOS/Android feud (divide and conquer, baby), the Kardashians and NFL domestic abuse scandals, all while working shittier jobs for shittier pay, all while trying to crawl out of our debts to get ahead.
The rest of your post is fantastic, but I just wanted to point out the possibly subconscious defeatist attitude that your comment started with.
@_date: 2014-10-31 14:27:23
Exactly. It's embarrassing that most are conditioned to be grateful for the scraps the job creators feel we can have. For now.
It's almost like Stockholm Syndrome.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:11:58
Except the Federal Reserve is neither Federal nor a Reserve.
@_date: 2015-04-05 12:27:30
There's a comparison here with corporations hoarding cash reserves somewhere....

This would also make sense geopolitically considering the natural gas situation between Gazprom and the EU as a response to the Ukrainian crisis.
It makes more sense after you read about the [Blue Stream Pipeline]( that bypasses Ukraine, allows Turkey and the Russian Federation to cozy up some more, and now, with the Greco-Turkish border, suddenly we got some pretty prime real estate for that pipeline to connect back into the EU.
So, why *wouldn't* the Russian Bear extend a paw to them? It'd give him an ally, he could renegotiate a deal as far as the food sanctions go (since Greece doesn't give a shit about the Euro as a currency - you really think they'll hold up their end of the economic sanctions the US strong-armed through the UN after their Ukrainian coup? It makes a bunch of sense for both sides).
Gonna get a bunch of Greeks back to work on infrastructure for all that Gazprom gas, and then they can start pulling a Ukraine and charging the EU as a pass-through country, something the Netherlands has been having success with economically (also, coincidentally, with Gazprom...)
Either way, at this point, I would be surprised if this *didn't happen*.
