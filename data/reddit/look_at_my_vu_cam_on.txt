Reddit age = relevance to net worth?
Honestly, in this world 500 BTC is nothing. Maybe you think a few million dollars is a lot of money, but in the grand scheme...it isn't.
500 BTC was a measly $100k just 3 years ago. Even less 6-7 years ago.

If you think BCH is going away anytime soon...you're insane.
Sell now...at 0.11 BTC/BCH? You must be a fucking retard.
Pumps to come, my partisan, team loving, friend.
Let me explain why:
Lightning is 24 months away from being deployed. Add another year to this for wallets and exchanges to upgrade. So...3 years until the average SPV wallet Bitcoiner is using Lightning.
3 years in crypto? A fucking eternity.
In those 3 years we are going to see another major rally in BTC. It's just gonna happen...anyone that has been here long enough knows this.
What happens during a huge rally in Bitcoin? Transactions go up...a lot. What does this increase in transactions do? That's right...it increases fees on the network.
Ya with me so far?
So, you're having this price rally in Bitcoin...transactions increase, thus fees. And who drives these rallies? Newbs. That's right, newbs (like you) drive these rallies. Do newbs understand concepts like censorship resistance or why decentralization is important? No, they don't. They understand ONE thing: Price
So as the rally unfolds, suddenly fees become unsustainable for regular users...but wait, there is something called BITCOIN CASH? THE FEES ARE LOWER? AND IT'S A CHEAPER COIN?? OMG.
&lt;Cue newbs thinking like newbs&gt;
&lt;Cue sockpuppet army employed by Ver and others&gt;
&lt;Cue the utility of Bitcoin Cash. Because yeah, it actually *is* cheaper than legacy BTC, decentralization be damned. But again, newbs don't care nor understand this anyway.&gt;
&lt;Cue CNBC pumpers&gt;
Etcetera, etcetera.
Suddenly, BCH is worth 0.30 BTC/BCH and **YOUR** dumbass sold at 0.11. Good job, newb.
Have some vision. Stop trying to be on a "team". There are no teams in crypto. Just like there are no teams in politics. **There are just other people trying to put their hands in your pockets.**
Or hey, go ahead...sell your BCH. Continue having the foresight and memory of a goldfish. 
I don't even like BCH...but I recognize what is being built by these BCH pumpers. It's going to be huge. Sustainable? Maybe, maybe not. 
Short to medium term? BCH is going to surprise the fuck out of everyone.

Anyone that keeps up with this shit knows this bullshit about DNM all switching to Monero is a bunch of nonsense. There is no physical cash, peer to peer liquidity in anything other than BTC. Like, none.
People meet with in person cash deals and they use BITCOIN.
Monero and Zcash are literally only used to wash away the taint...then everything is converted to new (hopefully) clean BTC again via a variety of ways. That BTC is then used to facilitate cash withdrawals, via peer to peer cash trades and other means.
But increasingly, people aren't converting to physical USD anymore...and instead keep their profits and facilitating deals in BTC directly. Rebuying from sources in BTC, not USD. Larger and larger scale dealers are starting to get on board.
This is one of the reasons I saw the value in crypto years ago. If even 10% of worldwide illicit trade is eventually facilitated in crypto, while Bitcoin even maintains at least a 20% market dominance...do you have any idea what the price of Bitcoin would have to be? **And fuck 10%, there is an almost certainty that ALL illicit trade will happen in crypto, of some sort, within 15 years.**
So how much is Bitcoin worth then...with even a 5% market dominance?
And we're not even talking about legitimate use cases. Just illicit trade.
Answer: Well beyond anything any of us are really comprehending at this point in time.

Would you work to keep only 20% of the money you earn?
Without productivity, the social programs you list are not sustainable. Sure, they may (somewhat) exist in a few small, homogenous, countries now...but **at scale**, the resources required would consume 80% of all human productivity.
So again I ask, would you go to work every day to keep 20% of what you earn and give 80% to the "greater good"?
The world isn't fair...trying to change this through forced taxation does nothing except disincentive productivity in the end.
We're fucked, sadly.

It's weird to me that more people don't see this angle.
I suppose that's because there are more people that become employees than people that have the risk-taking tolerance to start a business.
The "employers are evil bc they make profit" narrative is bizarre. Without the incentive for profit, who is going to risk their capital?
Am I going to start a non-profit with 90% of my hard earned savings and dispurse all the profits to employees because it's more "fair"? No, and nobody else will either. There has to be an incentive to take that risk..
..and profit is the necessary incentive.
Humanity has a tendency to expect something for nothing. If we'd all expect less, humanity would be much better off.

Agreed. But I think the symptoms of a USD crisis will be felt in equity markets first....then the systemic issues with the dollar will start to be undeniably clear to the market.
But imagine a flee to USD from equities because the markets are way overvalued...then dollar/euro crisis happening in the following months/years.
The world will get ugly as fuck for a while. I mean, it's already ugly....but it can definitely get more dystopian when something like the world reserve currency of the world is viewed like the Bolivar.

Want to respect someone for the money they've made? There are plenty of guys out there that made their money from nothing...and didn't fuck everyone over they came across like a nickel and dime hustler fuckup, like Belfort.
Maybe Belfort seems cool when you're 17 years old. But to anyone with a brain and some wisdom...you see what he really is: A fucking loser.

But no, my politics and stance on the issue we're discussing differ from the arguments I make here. It's called playing Devil's Advocate...are you familiar?
I play Devil's Advocate a lot. It's honestly the only way you get anywhere...debating both sides in your own mind. The conclusions reached and solutions created are A LOT more practical and probable than just taking a side based on emotion and zero logic.
And honestly, you sound a little bit heavier on the emotional side rather than the logical side of your brain. Are you female? (I ask this because women generally are more likely to be emotional as opposed to logical.)
You think that I don't care there are people that don't have a roof in a lot of places in this world? Or food? Or clean water? That shit is beyond fucked. **In the country I choose to live in, I see poverty daily that is well beyond the "poverty" most Westerner's ever see in their lives.** The young kids fuck with your brain the most.
But yeah, it doesn't affect me because anyone that disagrees with you is a psychopath that jerks off to misery.
Do you know why these debates never progress to real action? **Because everyone is too worried about being right.** Fuck being "right". I want the best answer.
My entire point is that given the current opacity of government taxation structures, there is absolutely no viable way to implement social programs to the degree many are demanding. So yes, the current government mismanagement  and misappropriation of public funds would result in 80% of all productivity being necessary to support these socialist systems. There is simply too much waste in our existing systems.
Until you fix the government/tax architecture of our societies, throwing tax money at the problem will absolutely kill productivity. Opacity in government needs to go FIRST.
Remove opacity, and you're right...we could have these programs deployed for much less. But that is the ONLY way it happens.
The best answer is somewhere in the middle of you and I. You need to lose the "everyone that disagrees with me is **my fucking enemy**" mentality. It's counterproductive.

You know all that dirty money flowing into real estate across the US, UAE and other markets? They'll overpay for a house for $1MM that'll be worth $500k within 5 years. But at the end of it, they have an asset that they actually own...in a haven where they *actually get to keep it*.
Sure, the loss of value may suck...but would you rather have $1MM in cash stuffed in a closet for your government to seize at some point, or $500k tucked away somewhere safe?
Bitcoin is the ultimate safe haven. Not to mention, prices will not stay depressed forever. Market maturity, I believe,  is around $400k+. But who knows.
And even IF bitcoin stays at these levels forever, I defer to my original question about having $500k or $1MM. 
The reason I got into BTC in 2012? I know very well how much dirty money is floating around this world. A place it can go where nobody can touch it? **Do you have any idea how valuable that is?**
And dirty money in one place isn't considered dirty in another. Marijuana money in California versus marijuana money in Saudi Arabia, for instance.
You can all cry sour grapes over the price....so have countless others over the years. You all eat those words in time....or just never admit when you're wrong. I suppose it's up to you.
People in this space have the memory of fucking ants. (Or more likely, we are at a stage I like to call "peak newb". Once this crowd dispurses in disgust with the "FUCK THIS SCAM" posts, somewhere around $3k, then we can go sideways for a long while and build a base...a la early/mid 2015.)

You know, there is this thing that encompasses the collective intelligence of the human species into a small, compact and easily navigable system where you can learn anything and everything about the world.
Most will squander the use of this system with hours of keeping up with gossip and other utterly unimportant nonsense. However, a small minority of its users will utilize this system to its full potential, reaping significant economic and intellectual gain in the process.
20 years ago, such a magical system would have been unheard of and as coveted as gold. But today, it is accessible to anyone, anywhere...at a nominal cost to the user. If one is inclined to learn and thrive using this system to enrich their lives, nothing can stand in their way. 
The onus is now on the individual....you. There is no longer an excuse for any human being, rich or poor, black or white, fat or tall, hungry or not really so hungry to stay ignorant to anything they wish to learn.
What is this magical system I am referring to?

Perhaps you feel this way...I believe most people do not.
Most of humanity does *just enough* to meet their basic needs. It's sad, but true.
In addition, people will simply demand more and more. 
Give people housing and they'll say:
"A group home?? How dare you! Why do OTHER PEOPLE get their own apartments? This is NOT FAIR. **EVERYONE DESERVES THEIR OWN HOME!!** &lt;Cue news story about rape in group homes and/or their terrible conditions&gt;"
What do humans want? They want **more.** Always more. Give it to them...and they'll want more.
It's our nature.
And they'll destroy the productivity of the world in the process.

For the super paranoid.
Also, don't even have a SIM in it.
The problem with taking the battery out is when you turn it back on the time will be out of sync. Since 2FAs are time based, authenticator will require the time to be correct in order for it to give the correct code.
So, leaving the phone with the battery intact is a must, unless you want to reconnect to the internet each time. (Potential attack vector for someone with access to your wifi)
Hence the faraday bag. You can keep the phone in the bag when it's not in use...on or off...while knowing the device cannot connect to any wifi, bluetooth, gps, or otherwise.
We're talking about some highly targeted attacks here though...but when BTC is $100k a piece, just **imagine what the sophistication in these hacks will be.**
