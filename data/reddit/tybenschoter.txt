I am a liberal and agree with Krugman on his macro-economics and I'm don't think Bitcoin is a good investment, but even still calling it "evil" is just pure hyperbole. I really expect better journaeism's than that. His column didn't support the headline.

Well the Japanese Yen for the last 20 years has been increasing in value. This is deflation where currency increases in value which sounds like a good thing but is actually a really bad thing because it disincentivizes spending money. "Why would I spend my dollar this year when it will be worth $1.02 dollars next year?" In practice this means that there is not enough increase in spending to spur growth. 
With moderate inflation you are encouraged to spend your dollar today as opposed to next year when it will be worth 98¢. This is useful because it encourages people to spend and invest instead of just save. Once again saving sounds like a great thing, but it really is not if you want strong economic growth.

Thanks for being civil!

There is no economic statistic that supports the idea that inflation is higher than reported. Our slow level of economic growth is inconsistent with a higher level of inflation and private bank estimaies of inflation are in line with the official numbers. 
Bitcoins are not being spent with estimates that people are just sitting on roughly 78% of them which is what you'd expect with a deflationary currency 
Also my checking account has nothing to do with anything. It is still the same in nominal terms and there is no evidence that it's purchasing power is going down by more than the official inflation rate.

Really? He has been saying that quantitative easing would not cause inflation and it has not. He predicted that the housing bubble would burst and cause a large recession and it did. He argued that Europe which passed only a middling stimulus plan would do more poorly than the United States which passed a much larger though still insuficient stimulus and it has. He has argued that austerity would put Europe in jeopardy of a double dip recession and Europe experienced both a double and triple dip recession. His track record seems pretty good to me.

No they will still spend on those fixed costs, but they very well might wait to buy a new tv until their old one breaks because it will be cheaper. They are more apt to keep their money in bonds or savings accounts than investment in stocks because of the deflation compounded on guaranteed returns in these investments. 
Additionally they cannot pay these thing in Bitcoin, generally anyway, further increasing the incentive simply to hoard them and wait for their value to go up.

Inflation is at less than 2% per year so his 100 would be worth $98 or more after a year. Bitcoin's constantly increasing value is why it isn't an effective currency right now. Why would I spend my Bitcoins today when they'll be worth more tomorrow? This is deflation, which is much worse for economies than inflation. You might be able to make money off of an investment in Bitcoin, but it will not be a viable currency for this reason. The function of currency is to facilitate the exchange of goods and services a deflationary currency gets in the way of that function.

My checking account is fine. My balance goes up and there is no indicanion that my purchasing power is going down. Find me one credible statistic that says that we have an annualized inflation rate of 24% or greater. There is no possible way anyone could ever hide that. Your assertion otherwise is just ludicrous. Also using economics jargon in a discussion on economics is just being educated not being a tool.
