Literal nonsense. The US had the most gold reserves **because** it had the most economic power, not the other way around. US gold reserves did not create US economic power.


The only reason this gives the US power is because the US has the ability to regulate the supply of it's own currency by inflating (printing more) of it. China would have no such power regardless of how much BTC it decides to sit on. So you're comparing apples to oranges by ignoring fundamental properties of Bitcoin.


Seems like it's more than you can grasp too since you don't seem to have any clue what you're talking about.

You're literally just making stuff up. China holding 17m bitcoin would not "choke" anything out. Why would it? Bitcoin can be divided into incredibly small units, still enough for you to send pennies to people regardless of the price. So even with 4m Bitcoin circulating, it would still be usable.
You'll notice that in all your arguments, you're not actually explaining what would happen. You're just shouting out numbers and percentages trying to imply that something would somehow be "bad". They're literally not doing anything harmful to you, quite the opposite, if they start spending hundreds of billions of dollars slurping up 35% of all Bitcoin just to sit on it.
I'd love for China to start aggressively purchasing all the Bitcoin in the world, because that would literally skyrocket my savings. I'd love to sell the few Bitcoin i hold for $100k each to China. No problem.

you wouldn't, because it doesn't actually work as described. These are just fantasies of poor people who want to blame the rich by claiming that they're only rich because they "manipulate the market" or whatever.

They don't "control" Bitcoin if they only start accepting Bitcoin. That doesn't make sense.


This would require that they spend probably 100 Billion dollars buying BTC, massively enriching all the people who sold them the BTC.
And then what? The government keeps 35% of BTC in their private accounts. How does this give them any power that people currently hoarding BTC don't already have? It's unlikely that anyone is going to buy the BTC from them for the same price the government bought it. So they'd just lose billions of dollars.

You're confusing China hoarding BTC and China "controlling" BTC.
It doesn't matter if China currently holds 99% of BTC. So what? What power do you think this gives them that them holding $100 Billion USD wouldn't give them?
You're inferring weird nefarious motives and consequences from literally nothing.

If you honestly believed this you would immediately join in on the manipulation the moment you saw it and make tons of money together with whoever is doing it. The fact that you don't do this means you're unable to distinguish what is and what isn't manipulation.
The correct answer to the OP is: nobody knows.

No, you're talking about them already having it and then somehow magic bad voodoo happens that does something bad apparently that you haven't been able to elaborate on or explain a single time in this thread.
