Thanks for the reply. 
So there's a few days wait after the initial delay with miners not picking it up, and this 4 day wait isn't unusual?

Thanks for your help. A few hours after I posted this the funds transfered.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:54:14
the transaction ID was 
The address it was supposed to go to was:
Is that the kind of info needed?
@_date: 2015-05-09 03:33:12


would be **2015.04.23**, wouldn't it?
@_date: 2015-05-09 03:13:25
yep definitely fully synched, I've been synching regularly and I have a green tick.
@_date: 2015-05-09 04:34:57
yikes! that's not good. I'd hate for that btc no to have gone over the network correctly. 
@_date: 2015-05-09 07:20:34
Thanks for the advice. All sorted out now!

Can I ask about the sweeping process?
Can I just install another version of the client, pointing the blockchain database to the where it is sitting on my PC, and just send the balance of the original wallet to a new address in the new client? No need to re-download the blockchain, right?
If the original installed client is at fault, I'm risking that the process of sweeping won't confirm, aren't I?
I guess I could test with a small amount, couldnt I?

It's not on all the time, but it's synched regularly (once a week, roughly) 
Not sure how to paste the raw data but this is the txid.

If I'm reading that top comment form that link correctly; they had no confirmations because they didnt include the transaction fee for mining, and it resovled for them overnight? Mine fee was included in my transaction, as far as I know.
My transaction is a couple of weeks old now. 
Anyway, I've backed up my wallet via the QT wallet, by doing file -&gt; backup wallet.... 
That backs up the Private Keys doesn't it?
If I try to download another QT wallet version and point the database back to where it is on my PC, wont the unconfirmed transaction still be amongst those blocks on my PC?
I'm wary about having to re-download the whole blockchain, even though it's apparently quicker these days. Is this the most obvious solution? 
@_date: 2015-05-09 06:09:25
Yeah it was lucky I was checking to see the sends were even being confirmed. 
The receiver didnt mention anything about not getting the BTC in the first place.
I'll check out Trezor, thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-10 02:13:55
Sorry man, I got none left :(
@_date: 2015-05-09 05:55:08
Thanks, I had backed up the wallet.dat
I've installed the new client and used the backed up wallet.dat file and the BTC is back in my wallet!  It mustve been the old client playing up, it seems.
I guess I can try to resend it now. I'm just doing a test spend to see if it's all going smoothly.
I've created a new wallet.dat file from the new client, and have sent a test spend from the old wallet to the new wallet, by copying in and out the old and new .dat files and restarting the client. 
It is at one confirmation so far, so that's good news.

thanks! I've tried it out. 
Then I ran out of tips to send them back to you. :(
I appreciate the help!

You're right. I'm kinda unsure how to do the reddit tipping. I'm sure it's not too hard to figure out, but I was busy sorting out the problem first. 
Not saying you think I should be the one tipping either but justifying myself anyway ;)

I'm really not sure of the exact addres it goes from in the QT wallet. 
I have a bunch of addresses, but when I pay to another address I don't get to choose which one it actaully comes out of as far as I know. The wallet just tells me which address it's going to. 
Is there a way to find this out?
