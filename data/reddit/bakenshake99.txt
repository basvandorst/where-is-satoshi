If bitcoin can moon over a thousand bucks in like 12 hours then why is this sub filled with nay sayers and bears lol? What’s to stop bitcoin from smashing the ATH in the coming months? HODL and stfu real simple

Same here man, took about a three grand loss. Said strong hands hold at the bottom and didn’t sell, excited for the future!

Everyone keeps saying we’re in for a big move and all bitcoin does is move sideways lol, guess that’s why we HODL

Maybe I don’t, kinda new to this whole bitcoin thing. Just trying to figure out if this price drop is due to market manipulation. And if it is, what’s the chance that it happens again? What you said makes sense, but we also had the opportunity to acquire more bitcoin on the cheap.

Kinda new to the whole BTC thing, what is up with the price? Everything that I researched said we were at the start of a historic bull run. Is that still the case, or were the bears right? Oh yeah and HODL till I die lol
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:30:40
Ok and if it was orchestrated, what did those who orchestrated it gain? Within the time frame of a couple hours, a billion plus fiat dollars was lost in the bitcoin market and the price plummeted. Are you saying the whales are the winner in this?
@_date: 2019-09-26 13:09:38
That makes no sense, for the price of bitcoin to go up, it needs to be used by more and more people. It needs to be a mainstream store of value. Why would the whales, who have huge equity in bitcoin, discourage people from investing? 
And if what you said is true, HODL’rs are getting rich and everybody else gets fucked?
@_date: 2019-09-29 07:19:39
Welp, we’re still holding at about 8,000. Could be worse lol
@_date: 2019-09-25 12:41:31
Hold up, if this drop is due to market manipulation, which some have said. What would prevent more manipulation around the halving time? Are we fucked in general?

This chart is assuming that the price rebounds, if it doesn’t, and continues to fall, then there’s the possibility that the bull run might be delayed. Idk, but I really hope that’s NOT the case
