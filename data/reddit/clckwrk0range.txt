Road repair and police patrol, huh? I guess you surmise that those two functions are being handled sufficiently by "our" government via our taxes? 
It is every person's moral duty to avoid paying taxes to the greatest extent possible. The power to tax is the power to destroy (oh! there is something they do sufficiently).

In reality, all services are barter. My time for your money or time or whatever. There is no profit.

You'd still be voting for Fraud A vs. Fraud B but at least the most popular Fraud would win. I'm more interested in determining what percentage of the population actually voted for either Fraud.
