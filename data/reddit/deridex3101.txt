Why would you ever need to save to buy a single bitcoin? It's denominated. 
@_date: 2018-08-25 18:15:37
That's not how inflation works.

You do whether you want to or not: Higher premiums or taxes.

Bitcoin is more risky than smaller altcoins?
@_date: 2018-08-05 05:27:43
That's not a statement about risk though.

If you think there's no difference between the various political parties you can vote for, we can't really have a conversation. Their policies impact us in many ways, and by choosing not to vote, you remove a major tool in your ability, however small, to affect the outcome, and the future.

Every choice you make has positive and negative consequences. No government will ever be perfect. What you do is try to influence its course in a way that more closely aligns with your worldview and interests. 
I understand your point of view that government uses force to coerce people to comply to its laws. The issue is that outside of small communities, it would be very difficult to organize societies without laws. Laws can only be enforced through some kind of force. It's a circular argument to be sure, but unless the group in question is small, isolated, independent of other influences, it's unlikely that it can function as a purely voluntary society.

Conversely, if you don't vote, you cannot claim that you exercised your political right to choose a leader. The alternative I infer from your argument is that you expouse anarchist philosophy. Even in such a society, there will be some form of organization that organizes society. Whether you call it government or it takes a different form, there will always be authority on some level.

According to Cointracking.info I have lost about enough to cover several years... hah!

Voters were always under emotional and social pressure.
Not voting empowers those people you want to subvert. You have withdrawn your most legitimate political tool to change policy.

I've lost much more than capital losses cover... Lol

No it doesn't. Bitcoin came out 10 years ago. Those 35 yr olds would have been 25 if they were early adopters. Even so, it's not a hard rule but a general observation.

No because that is 666. What does 200,000,000 have to do with it? I think we are missing the joke. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 12:00:21
Lol sorry. It really is going over my head. I honestly don't get it.

Good quote, not the best man to quote. I mean, I am sure I could find a Stalin quote I like, but I probably wouldn't use it.

I got you, man.
