I‘d still try to calm down somehow since binance don’t seem to be fraudulent at all. Maybe he’s ill or something like that. I wish you good luck

Can’t believe he’s actually right with that
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:05:39
Ty for that

Shooting star or inverted hammer ? ��
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:15:10
Would be terrible

Hover your mouse above the candle. Top left will say O ... H ... etc. H means the high of the therefore just read the number. There’s no need to search the price with your mouse
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:30:12
Chart says 19.891 for me

I’ve eyed huobi and okex on my own which clearly have fake volume - don’t know about the others which are not popular like you said because nobody uses them. They’ll probably stay or realise sooner or later that nobody wants to be on their exchange so they shut down. Who tf trusts such embarrassing exchanges anyways.
Binance will most likely keep staying on top followed by bitfinex and coinbase.
Check openmarketcap for seeing which are actual exchanges
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:27:28
I don’t get it. Daily volume at finex (tradingview) is 15k btc and this candle shows 20k btc ???
@_date: 2019-06-28 08:34:32
Oh don’t use that for detailed information. Dload TradingView and u’ll be good to go
Edit: nvm you said ‘mouse’ - check TradingView.com

Which ranking a are you talking about ?

@_date: 2019-04-26 01:43:50
That’s exactly what I’m wondering too as well as I can’t get the thought of my head that finex was pretty much robbed. Although I’ve very little knowledge about jurisprudence wherefore my thoughts are probably wrong.
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:17:33
Lovely 
@_date: 2018-11-04 19:06:35
Check tether markets. No idea how that’s being calculated.... doesn’t make any sense to me, it’s $1 st finex and .93 at kraken 
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:23:58
Basically not buying bitcoin at an exchange
@_date: 2019-01-03 13:25:58
As if it’s enough btc to dump it to 2.5k 
@_date: 2018-11-27 10:07:36
The question is, is it to or from an exchange
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:26:41
Check the order books of major exchanges to get an idea. Of course it’s not accurate since there are hidden orders and stop losses.

@_date: 2018-11-25 00:38:16
Which is actually a potential bullish sign 
@_date: 2018-04-04 00:34:06
Where’s bitconnect
@_date: 2018-12-31 12:59:10
Dont quote me on that but if I remember correctly I’ve seen Korean exchanges trading at 23k ish
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:15:31
Btc needs to be ready ( technically ) for staying above potential all time highs
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:57:10
Is the cable plugged in ?
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:34:21
Seems like somebody is familiar with Elliot waves 
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:22:38
Tf u’ve no clue at all
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:35:55
Too good to be true
@_date: 2018-12-17 12:30:51
Tried quite a lot and tradingview feels best by far
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:43:29
I highly doubt that aswell, at least not much and just for a very short time but binance Order book doesn’t decide that. None does. Whales can easily pull their orders which happens all the time.
Edit: btw finex has 10k btc in buy orders till 3k.
@_date: 2018-12-07 16:51:53
You have to consider a shit ton of people are waiting to buy until they see a clear bear break. We‘ll see insane green candles.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:34:00
Lol i just checked them and thought the same. They’re getting so freaking cocky seriously. I’m waiting for them to cover so badly 
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:37:03
I don’t wanna be mean.
30.000/3750 = 8
8*20.000 = $160.000
