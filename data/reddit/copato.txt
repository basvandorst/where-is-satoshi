hm, the image adjusts itself on my end. Either way, try now. It's more simplistic, but better to navigate. You can switch to the full site anytime.

Appreciate the feedback! I've added the comment on the landing page of the site, hopefully that will spark some interest.
I've messaged many on deviantart (without sounding too spammy) if they would consider to offer their skills for bitcoin etc. Of the few replies I've got, some are curious, some seem to find bitcoin confusing, but no real interest in using the site for that purpose.
Just made a post on If there's little response, I'll head over to their forums and bitcointalk.

I started a site intended for anybody to start projects and find other people for collaboration. 
I've also seen many people ask “how can I contribute? - I don't have wizardly coding skills”, but, the enthusiasm sure is there.  
That's what I have in mind with this site, when people can do ordinary stuff in exchange for bitcoin, that's when it becomes a benefit that speaks to the masses.  With that in mind, I'd like the site to become a place for people to offer their skills, any skill; e.g. repaint your house in exchange for bitcoin, shovel snow for bitcoin, anything and everything really. 
If anybody is interested in offering their skills, here's where they can do it on the site: [CoinJobs](  
If you just want to contribute with a blog or dropping some knowledge in the forum section that would also be great! The site needs content. (anybody who reads this is welcome, right now it's only me there, weee! whole site to myself!)

Thanks for showing interest! 
**The vision:** Crypto gives us an opportunity to rethink money and how we use that to structure our lives. I believe payments and tipping alone isn't what gets the majority to become interested in crypto, but rather when people realize they can benefit from using it as a tool for mundane ordinary stuff. The idea of promoting an economic crypto ecosystem. [Here's a comment I made](
**Profits:** The site will be 100% free to use and 100% free from ads (not a great business model, I know).  It'll be totally donation based, the idea is that it's much better for each individual to give an amount representing the value they receive from using the service.
If somebody creates a successful project, or finds a job through the site, they hopefully value that interaction with a donation. The tokens rewarded to members on the site will also (hopefully) help incentivize donations. Because 50% (profits) goes to rewarded tokens, by donating you're appreciating not just the site, but members as well (this might include yourself if you have a token).
**Tokens:** The tokens represent a share of the profits, members receive these tokens by contributing to the site. It's not meant to be spent, but one can of course trade them freely. There aren't any special advantages in being an early adopter other than the fact you can accumulate more by being the first ones to contribute to the site. 
The more members that are helpful and contribute something, the better the site is, the more likely people will want to use the site, hence the more successful projects and more likely to send a donation.
In contrast; if the site has a bunch of members, but nothing meaningful is contributed. The site would be rubbish and nobody would use it.
Better site = more valuable token. 
**Why would it benefit you/me from using the site:** Over time with more members it can be an extra platform to present and reach a wider audience. That's not the case at the moment though, but it still is an extra platform.

There should be a “What is money anyway?” meme. Something that questions money, then maybe more people would start to think about what they hold as value and call money. (this was from an episode of New Girl btw)

I definitely agree! Even the simplest of gadgets usually comes with a manual. While it's important to understand the blockchain, how it works and what it can do, it doesn't have to be the starting point. We don't start on our drivers license with learning the fundamental details of how an engine works.
I've started a step by step on how to get started with a wallet, you can take a look [here](
You could replace it with the Mycelium wallet and add more info. If you want to use that template to get started feel free to do so. The .odp file's [here](
). (I used LibreOffice)
Rounding such a manual off with some terminology and a how to back-up &amp; safe practice section at the end would be nice.
Would be cool to have a site with decent manuals, having them in different languages with everything being very simple and basic.

Glad you lold! But then it seems like you took this way too seriously.
@_date: 2015-10-18 01:10:24
Hehe, lets hope the next release isn't called "To The Moon and Back". I'll give you the heads up if that's the case.
@_date: 2016-05-21 08:42:53
I get that. Actually, I'd probably not bother myself either.
These tokens aren't exactly well known, the quiz was really mostly for people who aren't familiar with bitcoin or the concept of tokens. The token I was going to send is called [FANTOKEN]( like I've stated they're experimental tokens. It's the token for project [Block Label](
If you have any questions about them, or if you change your mind and want some, just let me know.
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:32:19
Woohoo! (This is a spoiler, answer was supposed to be PM'ed, whoops)
Anyway, you've got it right! Are you interested in the tokens mentioned?
@_date: 2016-05-20 18:15:23
Out of curiosity, can I ask why? 
Since you answered in this thread I reckon it's easy for you to put up an address that could receive these experimental tokens. Others who have answered are usually new to bitcoin, therefore it's kind of a hassle for them to get a hold of an address. 
Obviously, why would anybody want some experimental tokens?
