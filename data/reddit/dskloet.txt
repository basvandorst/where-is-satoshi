Transactions cost the same regardless of the amount transferred. The fee doesn't go to the wallet app, it goes to the miners. If they have to choose between processing a $100 transaction with 5 cent fee, or a 7 cent transaction with a 1 cent fee, they will choose the 5 cent fee. So if your wallet app wouldn't charge the fee, your transaction might never complete because no miner might want mine it.
If you want to complain to anyone, complain to the Core dev team who are unwilling to increase the block size limit. With larger blocks, miners would be able to include transactions with lower fees.

Miners are not forced to include transactions. Why would they include a transaction without a fee? Larger blocks have a higher risk of being orphaned so without fees miners would be best off not to include any transactions.

In general you shouldn't keep your fiat and coins on exchanges longer than necessary, but there is no need to specifically worry about Coinbase.

I've had that basically since I started using Reddit so I had forgotten it wasn't the default.
It's pretty sad and somewhat ironic though that you are stickying your own comment in this post. It's a helpful comment but in no way warrants using your moderator powers.

I think it would be good to force banks to explain the difference between a full reserve account (which I don't think currently even exists) and a traditional bank account, so that people can make an informed decision on what to use. Once that's established, when a bank goes bankrupt, people with full reserve accounts just get their money out of the full reserve and other people are out of luck as they knew the risk.

I still don't like that they plan to have a withdrawal fee rather than a deposit fee. I don't mind paying a bit for the service, but if I send someone 1000 bits, I want them to receive 1000 bits and not 990.

You need the bank's approval to redeem them. The coin becomes worthless when the bank says they will not back your coin anymore. Because of that they are in full control. Except that they can't prevent you from transferring the worthless coin.
@_date: 2015-06-16 19:40:20
If you pay a fee for withdrawing, the 1000 bits they received aren't actually 1000 bits because they can't withdraw 1000 bits. That's my point.
I want to be able to send an amount that they can actually withdraw. If the message says they received 1000 bits I want them to be able to withdraw 1000 bits. Sure I can send 1011 bits so they can withdraw 1000, but then the message says I sent 1011 bits and again they can't withdraw what the message said.

I think 0-conf will be fine for digital content. Those who want to pirate it will pirate it anyway and there is no real cost to creating additional copies so having some small percentage of double spends is not as much of a problem.

Have you ever managed a large community?
Imagine you create a new subreddit. Many people like it and many people join. You do your best to keep it nice and tidy by removing posts that are off topic. At some point a bunch of people don't like your opinion on what is off topic, even though you created the subreddit in the first place. Should those people make their own subreddit or should you be removed from your own subreddit?
The vast majority of readers might not even comment. They read because they like the way you make sure everything is on topic. Why should the small minority of active posters be able to take the community from you by force?
I have experience managing a large community and it's amazing what kind of completely unfounded conspiracy theories people come up with just because you have the power to remove posts.

If you use an HD wallet you normally use each address only once. But if new amounts appear in old address the wallet may decide to including all those small amounts into a single transaction.

You didn't answer my question. You just rephrased it. You're basically saying that if a comment is valid *according to your opinion*, but downvoted, then the voters are wrong and you are right. But no matter how much voting manipulation there is, the opinion of one person (you) can't be more valid than the voting outcome, since at worst the voting outcome is the opinion of just one person with an opinion that happens to differ from yours. But probably the voting outcome, even if not perfect, is more valid than your opinion.

Mining is looking for a block and a hash of the block so that that hash is a very small number. That just means changing the block a little bit and seeing what the hash is, many times until you are lucky enough to find a small enough hash. Then you publish that block to the network and everybody can see that it is valid because the hash is very small.

If it were a problem you could encourage keeping the UTXO database small by charging a tax on each output (for example, 1 satoshi per 1008 blocks per output). Once the tax is more than the value of the output, you can forget the output.

I know outputs are (or can be) spent separately. But outputs on the same address obviously already belong to the same person. If I have 1 BTC in an address, what does it matter that I receive an additional satoshi to the same address and spend it together with my 1 BTC? In this case the 1 satoshi doesn't cause me to merge addresses. And I don't see how merging outputs of the same address matters since it's already clear they belong to the same person.

That seems to make sense at first, but if you think about it a bit longer, holding fiat while not being able to withdraw fiat is really problematic.
Who determines the exchange rate? Normally the market does, but without an option to withdraw fiat, there is no market. You may think their rate is reasonable now, but what guarantee do you have that you will still find it reasonable when you want to withdraw?
Remember when MtGox would let you withdraw bitcoin but not fiat? Their exchange rate was way higher than elsewhere, because Goxdollars weren't real dollars.

That sounds very hand-wavy to me and I'd really like to see the evidence. It's possible that the constant factor is small enough that works in practice, but that doesn't mean it's O(1) and is not very scientific.
I agree that we'd have to be careful about mining without verifying the full block but to me it seems valuable to look into fixing that. And verifying the full block will take O(n) anyway so if verifying the full block is a requirement, then it doesn't really matter (for asymptotic complexity) if anything else is &lt; O(n).

10^25 = 10 * (10^3)^8 ~= 10 * (2^10)^8 ~= 2^83
So it's about 2^128 / 2^83 = 2^45 ~= 10^13 years.
That is at current speed. But if you take into account that the speed doubles every 2 years, it would only be about 90 years.
But before the 90 years are over there will be a quantum computer that does it much faster.

most importantly, we have listened to your feedback and we agree that trying
to superimpose two order books with different pricing is confusing,
forcing traders to do a lot of extra math when all they really want to do is
trade. Going forward, we will no longer be showing “Bitstamp” orders on our
book, but rather **regular “BFX” orders reflecting Bitstamp liquidity**, but
priced and grouped in such a way that BFX commission rules can be applied
uniformly to all trades on the platform.
The Bitstamp orders are still there. They are just reflected as Bitfinex orders.

Holding increases demand. Spending increases usefulness.
For the holding it doesn't matter if the merchant "bought" the BTC from a customer in exchange for goods or from an exchange for fiat. Holding is holding.
For the spending, it also doesn't matter if the merchant "bought" the BTC it spends from a customer or from an exchange. Spending is spending.
What does matter, of course, is whether spending implies "no longer holding" or whether the spent BTC are replaced by new BTC to hold.

Yes. Though of course if the amount is really small, I don't really care what happens to it anyway. At the same time I never use Windows anyway so it doesn't really matter.


I have a medium size amount in blockchain.info. As far as I know, the keys are always encrypted on the server.
I also have about $30 in Circle, $10 of which I got for free.
I also have a medium size amount on an exchange and I'm fully aware they are at risk.


Yes. Unless there's a very important reason I wouldn't use an untrusted computer to sign into my blockchain.info account. A Windows machine never qualifies as trusted, for me.


I would store a medium size amount on an online Linux machine and could store a larger amount on an offline Linux machine.


I guess. The majority of my coins are in cold storage with split keys using Shamir's Secret Sharing on laminated paper cards.

Why don't you start your own subreddit if you don't like this one?
From the FAQ:
What if the moderators are bad?
In a few cases where a moderator has lost touch with their community, another redditor has created a competing community and subscribers have chosen to use the new reddit instead, which led to it becoming the new dominant reddit.
If you have an issue with a moderator or the way a subreddit is being run, please first try contacting that moderator to see if it's just a simple misunderstanding. You may contact all of the moderators in a subreddit by messaging of subreddit] to appeal a decision. Please keep in mind, however, that moderators are free to run their subreddits however they so choose so long as it is not breaking reddit's rules. This means that moderators of certain subreddits can and have banned people from their subreddit for sending a message to them. So if it's simply an ideological issue you have or a personal vendetta against a moderator, consider making a new subreddit and shaping it the way you'd like rather than performing a sit-in and/or witch hunt.

Exchanges are just matchmakers between buyers and sellers. The buyers and sellers determine the price and usually there is an explicit fee.
Brokers set their own price and usually have an explicit fee as well. Because they are not matching buyers and sellers directly, they have to be very careful about the price they set. Especially if they have no fee, like Circle.
Circle probably has more buyers than sellers at the moment, which explains their slightly higher exchange rate. If the number of sellers increases they will have to bring down the rate. In an efficient market you should expect them to take a tiny loss depending on how well they set their rate but I wouldn't be surprised if Bitcoin isn't efficient enough yet and they're making a tiny profit on the rate.

@_date: 2014-08-31 20:28:30


No, you have an account at Coinbase. Coinbase is not a wallet. Their transactions may be delayed because they might have to get coins from cold storage before they can be sent.
But you are talking about confirmations. Payment is instant and the recipient can send those coins as soon as they have received them. But to be safe, the recipient may require a certain number of confirmations before considering the payment as received.
If you send coins to a Coinbase account, the recipient isn't the user; the recipient is Coinbase (remember a Coinbase account is not a wallet?). So Coinbase probably requires a certain number of confirmations before they consider the payment received and charge them to the user's account.

Blockchain.info sends me an email every time I receive a transaction.

They can claim no fees because they charge no fees. If you believe their price is too high then you should take advantage of that by selling bitcoins to them.

If you use an expensive hash function to generate the seed from the phrase, that should help. Wasn't scrypt originally designed for that purpose?
Another option is not to let the phrase be chosen by the user, or to use the phrase as a password to a randomly generated seed, rather than as the seed itself. But then the encrypted seed would have to be backed up as well.
@_date: 2014-07-17 20:44:47
Good point. I'm not sure how that works in my country (Switzerland).
@_date: 2014-08-03 12:30:18
Yes, this needs to exist. Though I guess it could already be accomplished with something like Copay.
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:57:45
Don't torture yourself with those websites. When you decide to spend it, you'll get a massive transaction so you'll probably have to add a big fee.

That's what I thought as well but I see a problem. Today, when average Joe gets hacked and a transaction is made in his name, he can call up the bank to reverse the transaction. With Bitcoin, however, this is not possible. So how will the bank deal with this difference?

I think I have just placed my bet. I wasn't sure if I should add a miners fee so I sent 8.4 mBTC to the bet and 0.1 mBTC as fee.
I'm not really sure if it worked. When I announced my bet it told me the address I should send my bet to. It took me some time to send the coins because I don't send coins so often and I had to double check everything in blockchain.info. But all this time there was your little spinning clock icon on your page.
This spinning clock icon gave the impression I only had limited time to send the coins but it didn't actually say how much time. It would be good if that was clearer. It made me quite nervous. I don't think you want to make your betters nervous :-).
After I sent the coins from blockchain.info, I clicked "Finish" on your page. Then it just sent me back to the bet page itself. Nothing really indicated whether I had placed my bet or not. So I have no idea if I did something wrong or not. More feedback from the site about what's going would be great.
After writing this I noticed the bet from "...76c3HEv4" on your page. I guess that's me. But it could definitely be more obvious to inspire more confidence.
Hope this helps.

I've used Bitstamp, Bitfinex and Kraken. I started using Kraken most recently. I don't really trust any of them enough completely but I'm least untrusting of Kraken.
I left Bitfinex after I reported a bug in their interest calculation algorithm, because while they admitted the error, they didn't consider it a bug. I found that very worrying.
I left Bitstamp when they wanted me to upload a selfie of me holding my passport, just to change my email address. That combined with reports of them holding funds hostage on verified accounts and the fact that their email database leaked, but they never made that public.

These services are potentially more dangerous than pools. One of them could have 51% of mining power and nobody would know it. But when they feel like it they could instantly redirect the power from the pool you chose to wherever they want.

This makes no sense. If they direct CEX.io to another pool, they can still do with it whatever they want.
Imagine, they direct it somewhere else. GHASH.io is now suddenly at 25%. Much rejoice. GHASH grows to 30%. And suddenly there's a 55% attack from CEX + GHASH.
It's a good thing that CEX points to GHASH because that way you can actually see what's going on. Otherwise it's hidden but the same threat is still there.

So I can comment now, but only on the entire document and not on individual sections like with real Google docs. So it's indeed not as useful for PDFs.
You say crypto currencies don't exist. That's a bit strange to say. Wouldn't hurt to rephrase that sentence.
Then you say Bitcoin is the first crypto currency and that all others are based on it. That's not accurate. Ripple existed before Bitcoin and their designs are quite different.
The proof of work doesn't consist of verifying transactions. Miners have to verify transactions but the proof of work is only to determine the order in which transactions happen in case coins are double spent.

You don't need to use the core bitcoin wallet. Synchronizing can take a lot of time and there are many wallets to choose from that don't need to download gigabytes of blockchain to use them.
Faucets are a waste of time. Even if you do get $1, in total, you'll probably pay a big transaction fee because of the many outputs that have to be combined in a big size transaction.

Sure, but why so complicated if you can just backup the seed?
@_date: 2014-10-02 20:14:21
They are bitwise operations.
xor takes 2 bits and outputs 1 bit. The output is a 1 if exactly 1 of the 2 inputs is a 1 and 0 otherwise.
and outputs a 1 of both inputs are 1 and 0 otherwise.
rightrotate operates on a sequence of bits by taking bits from the right and adding them on the left. For example, the number 236 in bits is 11101100. If you rotateright, you take the 0 from the right and put it on the front to get 01110110, which is 118.
"rounds" just means it takes the same sequence of calculations and applies it multiple times.

Mycelium creates a new private key for every transaction to protect you privacy. So writing one of them down wouldn't be that useful. All those private keys are generated in a deterministic way, based on the seed, which is those 12 words. So if you just hold on to those 12 words, you're fine.
If you want to have a paper wallet with one private key, I suggest you download bitaddress.org and run it on an offline computer booted from a Linux Live CD or similar.
Security is a big issue. Very regularly we read stories here from people who lost their bitcoins. All your money is protected by a single private key. If you get a virus, or malware that gets access to your private key, your money is gone irreversibly. And there's no customer service you can call to get your money back. So only keep small amounts (like money you would carry in your pocket) on an online device, and keep large saving on paper, or a permanently offline computer, with redundant backups. Being your own bank is a big responsibility.

@_date: 2014-08-10 07:12:49
The market doesn't care if the coins are lost. The price is determined by supply and demand and lost coins are neither part of the supply nor fulfill a demand. So the market does take lost coins into account that way, even if not everybody knows it.
For example, if I was planning to hold those coins, but now I lost them, I may buy some more to replace them, which increases demand. Or if I was planning to sell those coins, I no longer can which reduces supply. Both of these increase the price a little bit.
The only time when they are not taken into account is when the owner doesn't even know yet that they lost the coins.

When you use iDeal you login directly to your bank with 2FA. After you confirm the payment in your bank account, the bank informs iDeal which informs the merchant. At least I think that's how it works judging from the experience. Because of this (the money is pushed, not pulled like with credit cards) it's pretty secure and you don't really need charge backs.
@_date: 2014-03-23 21:06:11
If you have to private keys, you're definitely fine. I'm not sure how the mnemonic and wallet backup work exactly. I just keep a paper backup of the private keys. Unfortunately this means you have to keep using the same address or make a new print every time you use a new address.

You shouldn't just create a multisig address, you should also use it to solve the problem. ;)
The funds are sent to the multisig address. Then an nLockTime transaction is made to move the funds out of the multisig address to the recipient. The nLockTime transaction is signed by the sender and the recipient can sign it whenever they want. Now the recipient knows they can use the transaction when the lock expires and also knows that the sender can't move the funds without the help of the recipient.

It works offline. The codes are generated from the seed and the current time. You should always make a backup of the seed when you add a new account. But this also means that your 2FA is compromised when somebody gets access to the backup of your seed.

Addresses and keys start with some bits that indicate what it is. So normal addresses start with a 1, p2sh addresses start with a 3 and this particular kind of private keys starts with a 5.

There's the problem.
Why convert back after all this effort? If instead, she keeps the 0.8 BTC, next time she wants to buy something, it's a breeze! It's so delightful that another time when she sells something, she also decides to accept BTC. And suddenly she has closed the loop and freed herself (a little bit) from USD. Fast forward she might even decide to get (part of) her salary in BTC to close the loop even further.

Since you're buying a lot and are probably not going to spend most of it, you really want to have an offline wallet with backups.
If you keep your wallet on your computer that you use to browse the internet there is a serious risk that your coins will be stolen. So put them on an offline computer or on a piece of paper.
Also, make sure you have at least 2 backups. BACKUPS! And keep them in safe places.

I'm getting sick of people complain about what others decide to do *with their own freaking money*. 
Accepting money, holding money and spending money are different things. When you accept money you have to accommodate the person paying you. When you spend money, you have to accommodate the person you're paying. And when you hold money, you do whatever the hell you want.
Most merchants have to convert to fiat in order to spend anyway. Why care when exactly they do the conversion?
@_date: 2014-12-07 08:35:15
It's possible for a bitcoin to be owned by multiple people and you can define the number of people that need to agree in order to spend it. 2-of-3 for example.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:05:34
The government isn't taxing data. It is taxing capital gains. If you can buy something cheap and sell it expensive, then you have to pay tax over the gains. So it doesn't really matter how you define Bitcoin as long as it's clear that you can sell it for more $ than you paid for it.

Thanks, here's my feedback:
* The first thing I see is these 5 "cards", each of which is a "game". But 3 of them are identical. Why? If multiple people want to play the same "game", why aren't they in the same game? Or if they really have to exist, just hide that fact from me. There is no point in me seeing 3 identical games.
* Some of the games I see cost more to bet than I have. Maybe you should grey them out or hide them altogether.
* The amount that's most important (how much I can win) is in a really small font compared to the other data on the card.
* The create link is not as obvious as the game "cards". I suggest making the create link one of the cards but in a different color or something.
* After clicking the create link, I get on some form, but the form looks cut off at the top. The field that has the number 2 in it is only half visible and its label isn't visible at all so I don't even know what the field is.
* After creating a game, on the next page there was again something cut off behind the masthead. I can barely see it but it looks like the word "GAMES" and a blue and a red icon.
* Now I have created a game I have no idea when I will win or lose. So I click on my game and it tells me to fund my account. I thought it was already funded?
* It's not obvious that my own game is clickable because the mouse pointer doesn't turn into a hand like with the other games.
That's it for now. Good luck.

I'm not convinced it isn't possible to generate a one-time signature (which is a product from a private key d_A and a random number k) without generating d_A and k separately. You would still need to generate something in secret, but it may not have to include the private key (or k) itself.
Just because you don't want it to be possible, doesn't mean it's impossible. And I don't see why you would want that to be impossible.

In public key cryptography, you can encrypt something with a public key such that you can only decrypt it with the private key. But instead you can also encrypt something with a private key and it can only be decrypted with the public key. Since the public key is not secret, everybody can decrypt that message, so it's not really encrypted. But everybody also knows that it could only have been "encrypted" by someone who has the private key. So this "encrypting" with a private key is also called signing. There are other ways to sign a message but it always comes down to proving that you have the private key belonging to a given public key.
In Bitcoin you never actually "send bitcoins to an address". The only thing you can do is lock bitcoins behind a challenge, that is written in a special scripting language. In most cases this challenge is something like


Whenever a client sees a challenge like that it will display it as a certain amount belonging to that address 1abc, but it always is a challenge written in that scripting language.
Now when you "send" bitcoins to a P2SH address, the challenge looks something like this:


That underlying challenge can be anything. But currently it's almost always a challenge that reads something like:


If that's what you have, what you could do is show that script that hashes to 3abc and contains some public keys, and then sign a message with the private keys belonging to those public keys.
Hope that answers your question.

How does a CAPTCHA prevent a keylogger from capturing the password?


Sure, that's a good idea but that can be done with multisig with something like Copay from BitPay without a custom device.
All in all the BitStash device sounds extremely secure but it doesn't matter much as it is not the weakest link in the setup. The user's authorized devices are the weakest link and they can still be compromised.


Without a screen on the device to confirm the transactions you're signing, the setup can never be as secure as a Trezor-like device so I'd still say "truly secure" is not accurate.

in the next 30 years about 99.5% will be mined but since mining rewards halve every 4 years it goes on for a really long time. At some point it's just 1 satoshi per block and 4 years later it ends. So it's really irrelevant long before it ends.

This is a bad deal for both sides.
I like the idea but it's just not worth the hassle.
In order to guarantee to be able to pay at the end, both sides have to secure their liability in advance. 
So if Bitcoin goes to $6000, yes you have your 300 BTC, but only in addition to the stock you had to buy first. You have not doubled your bet but only won 10%.
If Bitcoin goes to $60, the other side has won, but they only won 10% because their collateral has lost most of its value.

The whole block (except the nonce and the hash that have to be mined) has to be created before the hash can be computed. The miners will try different nonces such that a small hash is found. When the nonce and small hash are finally found, all that's left is broadcasting the block to the network.

Mycelium has a feature called "cold storage". You scan a BIP38 wallet to make a single transaction and then it forgets the key again. I image it would work exactly the same except it can use a new address for the change instead of reusing the same address over and over.

That's a great explanation, but just in case you don't know:
The script that's run when a transaction is made is actually part of the output that's being spent, not of the transaction itself. The transaction merely provides the input to the script and the script that dictates how the new output can be spent.

That's not really the right analogy. The right analogy is me handing over a $20 bill and expecting the cashier to hand me back change. Where I come from, that's a perfectly normal thing to expect.
He wouldn't have access to the change because the change address wouldn't correspond to the same private key. You would spend from each address only once.

If you want an account, you can create one at [blockchain.info](
The paper wallet should have two keys. One starting with a 1 and one starting with a 5. The one starting with a 5 you should keep secret. The one starting with a 1 you can enter in the search box on blockchain.info to see if it has the amount of bitcoin that you paid for.

The way I imagine it is like this:
1. I use a special wallet app on my desktop to print some special paper wallets with amounts like 0.01, 0.02, 0.05 and 0.1, for example.
2. Each paper wallet has its own private key and a change address that send the money back to your desktop wallet. These could be combined in a single QR code.
3. Let's say you buy something in-person, that costs 0.04 BTC.
4. You decide to use the 0.05 BTC paper wallet and give it to them.
5. They scan it with their special merchant app that reads both the private key and the change address.
6. They sweep the 0.04 to themselves and send the change back to your desktop wallet. They're nice so they decide to pay the transaction fee from the 0.04 :-).
7. You get a notification on your phone showing what happened.
8. You can either decide to check your phone right there, or trust that the merchant didn't steal the remaining 0.01 BTC.
9. When you run out of paper wallets, you use the combined change, plus whatever extra you add, to create a new stack of paper wallets.
Does that answer your questions? And does it make more sense now?

The miners don't decide what block they are mining for. The pool sends out the block header and the miners just mine what they are told. So the pool can do what they want with that power as long as the miners stay with the pool.
But the miners can leave at any time if they want.

If I understand OP correctly, this was not a paper wallet but a [cryptocard]( It doesn't really make sense to use a new cryptocard every time. I think it's fine to keep using the same one as long as you realize it's not cold storage. Depending on the app you use it with, it's still safer than a hot wallet. Just use it with amounts appropriate for the level of security.

The point is that there are no "your coins". What you have with Coinbase is just a number. They can change that number or your control over it however they want (or however they are forced to by the government).
Sure, you're right that if you would have private keys to an address holding your coins, you would be in control of them. But what you are saying "you don't have the private keys" makes no sense because there is no "address with your coins" to which "the private keys" would be referring. That's what it means for the coins to be "off the blockchain".

Statistically Friday is a bad day to buy. On average the price goes down during the weekend. Better buy on Sunday.

But it depends how you interpret it. If the game ends in a tie, there's a penalty shoot out to determine the winner. The people who bet on "tie" might want to count that as a tie, while the people who bet on the winner of the shoot out, would count it as a win.
So you really need to define what the bet means before the game starts.

It's only confusing because the name of the currency ends in the word "coin". Fiat currencies also have coins with different values. Not every USD coin is $1. There are quarters, dimes, nickles. Bitcoin is simply less limited and can have coins of any value. Whenever you spend coins, they are "destroyed" and new coins with equal value are created in the process.

That doesn't matter. A company wants to make as much profit as possible. It's irrelevant whether other companies are profitable or not. It's the Bitcoin network itself that makes the margins so small by adjusting the difficulty.


That's completely backwards. If you believe bitcoins to be worth more than $1000 soon, you just buy as many bitcoins as you can rather than bothering with mining.

The blockchain solves the order in which transactions happen. It's important because if I send my money to A and then (try to send it) to B, A has it. But in the other order, B has it.
But if I send a social message or friend request to friend A and then to friend B, that's fine. The order is not super important.

One more thing: Bitcoin is extremely volatile and it's still possible its price increases by another factor of 100. So a $2 tip could be worth $200, 2 or 3 years from now. If somebody finds out 2 years after their funds were confiscated that they're now worth a lot more, they'll be even less happy.

@_date: 2014-11-15 09:24:23


It is not. Let me try to explain why with an example.
Imagine there are 2 services exactly like BitQuick, except one has a buyers fee of 1% and the other has a buyers fee of 5%. If I am a seller, you say that it makes no difference for me which of these two services I use. Let's say most buyers using a service like this are willing to pay 6% above market price. That means if there's a buyers fee of 1%, they are willing to take an order 5% above market, and if there's a buyers fee of 5%, they are willing to take an order of 1% above market.
To me as a seller that means I can make a 5% profit in one case and a 1% profit in the other. That's far from irrelevant. That's why I suggest you never list the sellers fee without also listing the buyers fee.


If it's not an issue, then why is it there? If you don't intend this to be a significant part of your revenue, I would suggest that you remove it, as it might scare sellers into not trying your service. I think the fact that you make promotions without withdrawal fee proves that you also know that this can be an issue.

Judging from those videos, it seems to be nothing more than a second factor for logging into a GreenAddress web wallet. I was more curious about the transaction signing process and how you will know that what is signed is what you want to sign.
Presumably it can be verified by plugging the device into an offline computer again to read it out. But if you have a second offline computer, you don't really need a hardware wallet, so I'm a bit confused about the added value.
I definitely wouldn't recommend following the first video as it shows the seed on an online computer, which kind of defeats the purpose of using a hardware wallet.

The range of these 150 hashes (5fxxx to 6dxxx) covers about 5% of the total space. So if someone had 3000 transactions, they could sort them and pick about 150 of them within this range and use them in a new transaction. Having 3000 transaction doesn't require cracking SHA-256.

That's pretty cool but the spread is a bit higher than at the major exchanges, right? Bitonic was also going to have an exchange called BL3p but it's still invite only and not much seems to be happening with it.
I've bought most of my bitcoins through Bitstamp but I don't want to use them anymore now that they started asking all those intrusive questions.
Next time I may use Bitonic or BL3p if it opens or maybe Kraken.

Today already most merchants/payment providers accept unconfirmed transactions. I don't think my paper wallet proposal has a higher risk of double spending than any other transaction. But sure, it's a problem worth solving.
But if you're going to rely on trusted third parties, there are simpler ways to solve the problem. You don't even need a blockchain. But it's kind of the point of Bitcoin not to rely on trusted third parties.
I also don't see how your proposal prevents double spending. Sure, the server can make sure that exact paper wallet hasn't been used twice, but how can it stop me from spending the original output again through any other means?
@_date: 2014-09-25 18:59:25

Not an answer to your question but I just wanted to point out that whether it is right after a block is confirmed is irrelevant. The expected amount of time until the next block does not depend on the amount of time that has passed since the last block (except for the few seconds it takes for the mined block to propagate).

That's bad advice. If you had a bad password before, you should consider those files compromised and send the coins to a new wallet with a better password. Deleting your own copies doesn't do anything to the copies that an attacker is currently trying to crack.

You're right to some extent but it still matters.
With https, I have to trust only one person/entity. This person can build a reputation of trust worthiness over time. Many people may read some of the code and if there's something fishy someone might find it.
Without https, the one person may be trust worthy and the code may be reviewed very carefully by many, but I can still not expect to receive what the one potentially trust worthy people intended to send me.
Sure you need some trust in both cases, but that doesn't mean there's no difference.

Just used it to send 1 mBTC back and forth. My first offline signed transaction. Pretty cool!
Definitely needs HD wallets and I still don't know what check private keys does. But my main issue is that it's not a very well known wallet app. I know it's open source but I don't really have time to read through the whole source and then build it from source code. So it's going to take time before I will trust this with more coins.
But definitely cool!
Edit: One more thing, the cold storage claims to have made a backup but I have no idea where it is. It must be somewhere on the phone though, which makes it not very useful as a backup.

If you add

You can easily make a colored coin that represents your house and transfer that coin to someone else. But it's useless if the authorities don't recognize it.
Also in "Uganda", even if you can trust that nobody will falsify the records, that doesn't matter if nobody comes to help you when somebody else occupies your property.
The technology is there, but it's no use until the reform is there that makes the technology accepted by the authorities.
Maybe the best you can do right now is go to a traditional notary, and make it official that a particular property is owned by the owner of a particular colored coin. After that you can transfer the property by transferring the coin, if it's recognized by that notary.

The first 99% is mined before 2036. The last satoshi is supposedly mined in 2140. So really the last 1% takes over 100 years (so yes, also the last 7%). This is quite meaningless because the reward halves every 210000 blocks, so if bitcoin was more divisible it would go on even longer. It's only because of rounding errors in the halving that it ever stops.

Do I understand this correctly?
This new opcode, together with a time (or block no.) value, is part of a transaction output in the blockchain. If an output has this opcode it can only be spent by a transaction that has nLockTime specified. The nLockTime must be after the specified time value, which means it can't be mined before then. This means the unspent output is "locked" until the specified time.
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:22:38
Wow, doesn't that mean that transactions are always delayed when they have to come from the hot wallet? Or can both transactions go in the same block? It also sounds like a lot of unnecessary fees. Do people really send coins back to a previously used address, without talking to the original sender? That trade-off doesn't really sound like it's worth it. At least in hind sight.

How do you guarantee a reasonable exchange rate? We might agree now that Bitstamp's rate is reasonable. But something (like MtGox or different) may happen and I may no longer think Bitstamp's rate is reasonable. They could change to another rate but someone else may find that unreasonable. I don't see how they could possibly *guarantee* a reasonable rate without a market.
@_date: 2014-07-25 19:49:02
Any possible way will cost a fee. Bitstamp's fees are rather steep though. Kraken or Bitfinex would be cheaper.

If you're worried about your son doing drugs, Bitcoin is the way to go. If your son wants to do drugs, he will one way or another. If he has to buy it with cash, he'll have to meet shady people you don't want him to meet. With Bitcoin he can order drugs from the safety of his home without ever getting into danger.
If you are worried about your son doing drugs, just talk to him about drugs, like a normal person. Make sure he understands the benefits and the dangers. Or even make some marijuana tea together. In the end it will be his decision and if he decides to do it, you won't be able to stop him. Better make sure he's well informed.
But seriously, Bitcoin is way more interesting than drugs. If you're in the US, [Circle.com]( might be the easiest way to buy some.

The blockchain is needed to agree on which transactions have been made. You really don't need it for identity, unless you want to transfer your identity to someone else.

If I understand your question correctly, you are asking about a controversial and incompatible change that some people decide to participate in and others don't. Is that right?
This basically creates an altcoin that is separate from Bitcoin. You don't have to decide where your Bitcoins go because they go on both sides of the fork. You amount of Bitcoin2 is equal to your amount of Bitcoin1 at the moment of the fork. After that you can spend them separately by using a client for the specific network. Like using different wallets for different altcoins.

Multiple phrases is better than a single word, of course. And original phrases are better than phrases from books.

blockchain.info doesn't do anything with your coins because they don't have your private keys. The coins only go where you send them. But blockchain.info is not very convenient if you don't want to reuse the same address. They don't have deterministic addresses so you have to keep making backups.

Your thoughts are reasonable but there doesn't seem to be any instruction related to time in [Bitcoin script](
Also note that anything that can be done with P2SH, can also be done without. You can always pay to the script itself rather than the script hash. P2SH just makes it easier because it lets the recipient give out an address instead of a script, to pay to.

But it is also possible to sign a transaction without taking your keys online. Install Bither on an old phone. Put the phone in airplane mode (and never online again).

Each amount should take all fees into account. So in my case the "if you win" amount would have been negative.

In order to use multisig, your funds have to be stored in a multisig address. You can't just link your existing wallets together. It's conceivable that wallets can work together in this way in the future but it will always involve sending your coins to a new address.

The problem is going from the existing infrastructure where transactions are reversible, to the better infrastructure where they aren't. The converters have to be very careful with that. Once you're in the new world, everything is great.
It would be great if this problem was solve, but I'm not sure it's necessary. We can just migrate over slowly. The new world is so much better that it will slowly close more and more loops and it will get easier for everybody.

Once they finally do start charging, they should charge for deposits, not withdrawals. If I send someone $10, I want them to receive $10, not $9.90. It's my decision to send the money so I can decide whether I want to pay a fee. But you can't tell someone they have $10 if there is no possible way to withdraw the full $10.

Even with a transaction fee, there's no guarantee that your transaction will be part of the very next block. But ignoring that, one in every 20 transactions is expected to take 30 minutes or longer before the first block is found.

It's not waste. When you burn coins, all other coins become worth a little bit more. Why give it to an arbitrary miner if you can give it to everybody?
But there is also an argument against burning on a miner fee. If you are a miner, you could include your miner-fee burn into your own block without broadcasting it to the network. That way you pay the fee to yourself without a risk of losing it to another miner.

I agree with your general message. Though a few years from now it might be less true.
That calculator gives 28 bits to just "password" so it doesn't even take a dictionary into account. I was thinking about how to create such a calculator but any implementation could only ever give an upper bound on the entropy and never a reasonable lower bound.
For example, the entropy of "correct horse battery staple" dropped from 44 bits to maybe 10 bits, the moment that comic was published, but a calculator could never take culture into account in such a way.

Personally I wouldn't want to enter my email address and register just to collect a small tip. So I also wouldn't want to force my friends to do that.

Even if 40% of the people are in favor of this, that doesn't mean it represents 40% of the money. Most likely the people who prefer spending are in favor while people who want to store value will stick with the more valuable coin. And even the 40% who wants to spend may still prefer the old coin for saving. Just because they think something is better for the economy, doesn't mean they will throw away their own money.

I don't imagine remittance being replaced by another remittance service. Instead I imagine you just send bitcoins and the recipient would either be able to spend them directly (in the future) or would need a local exchange to convert to their currency.

No, a currency has value because it's useful for facilitating trade. It gets a price on the market by matching supply and demand.


It's not. All Bitcoins combined are only worth about 5 billioin USD. All USD combined are several trillion (depending on how you count, which is hard because banks make them out of thin air).


That's just how the algorithms that determine how bitcoins are created are programmed. There will never be more than 21 million.

Mycelium has this "cold storage" feature. It's not really cold storage but that's what it's called. It lets you scan a BIP38 wallet and spend from it. It sends the change back to the same address. I want something like that but without reusing the same address every time. Reusing the same address is what keeps me from ordering from cryptocards.co.

You say that as if the buyer fee is irrelevant for the seller. The fee is how much of what the buyer pays doesn't go to the seller. If the buyer has to pay more to buy my coins, that means I can ask less for them. Whether you call this a fee for the buyer or for the seller is mostly irrelevant.
I see that I misunderstood the withdrawal fee. It looks like it is intended to keep the seller's offer trapped. But I don't understand why you would want to do that. If the seller feels their money will be trapped, I imagine they'd be much less likely to put up a sell offer.

If you want physical security as well, multisig is great for that. You could require that a relative co-signs every transaction from your super cold storage. Then anyone who finds your seed must also find your relative's seed or convince your relative to co-sign in order to steal your funds.

Sorry, I got the math wrong (the wiki was down).
The address space is 2^160, meaning there are that many possible addresses. 
The seed space is 1612^12 ~= 2^128 so adding a few more words would add some randomness. But adding more than 4 words doesn't add anything at all.
That said, there is really no guarantee that someone can't generate the same private key from a different seed. In fact, since you can generate an arbitrary number of private keys from a seed, it's certain you can have key collisions if you start with different seeds.

In general, you can't get the public key from an address, but you can get the public key from a private key.
But in Electrum you can get a public key from an address by using the getpubkeys function in the console.

    {
        "address": "156FFUYVqLjiRwuz5fW6JMxXBJvWpjvL6i",

Because that retina display is attached to a device with an open connection to the internet and operated my an idiot (i.e. average person) who downloads malware (i.e. silly games) for fun onto the same device. The whole point of having a separate device sign the transactions is that a persons main device can be compromised. But you are relying on people's devices not being compromised. Well, then they don't really need your device either.
Sure you can bring a little bit of extra security by making it easy to do multisig. But there's no way this is as secure as a device like Trezor.

If there are disagreements that can't be resolved, the block chain will fork and each bitcoin will split in two. The market will then decide the value of each type of bitcoin and most likely soon enough one of them will be worth zero and everything continues as normal with the other side of the fork.

You don't necessarily need to encrypt the private key. It just depends on how safe you can keep the paper wallet and how good you are at remembering the pass phrase. And whether you care what happens to your coins when you die.
You do need to have multiple backups of the paper wallet.
For extra paranoia you could have done everything in a fresh virtual machine. That way it's less likely to be infected by malware.
And as mentioned you should always overwrite your files with random data instead of deleting. On Linux this is done with "shred", on Mac with "srm". I'm not sure how it works on Windows but you shouldn't be using Windows with Bitcoins anyway :-).

But what's the point? Banks already have their own electronic transfer system. If the system is controlled by the bank anyway, there's no need for it to be distributed. There's no need to solve the Byzantine Generals problem.

Wrong. The feds could print a single note worth more than is backed by your atoms of gold. And you have no way of knowing that they won't.
I know you think this is ridiculous but think about the Turkish lira, for example. They had to remove six zeros from their amounts to keep the currency usable. If they'd do that every so often, soon enough you'd have your number of atoms. *You* have no way to guarantee the same won't happen to the USD. And in fact, given a certain inflation rate you can compute how long it will take for that to happen.

You seem to have missed the distinction I made between gods in general and a specific god. There are too many different gods people believe in and different definitions people use for god, that it's impossible to say anything about gods in general without knowing which definition of god you're talking about.
But the omnipotent, insecure, omniscient, free-will granting, angry, omnibenevolent, vengeful, absolutely moral, completely immoral monster that created the earth standing on 4 pillars about 6000 years ago as described in the bible is very specific and full of inconsistencies. I don't need to know everything because a single inconsistency is enough to know that it cannot exist.

When a block is mined, it confirms all the transaction in this block. This makes it difficult to change what that money is spent on and that is what makes your money safe.
@_date: 2014-01-19 12:09:53
Yes, you need an address + private key. They private key you keep to yourself to be able to spend the coins. The address you can show to others so they can send you coins.
When you buy bitcoins for cash, the other person will send bitcoins to your address and you give them cash. How you make sure he doesn't run away with your cash without sending bitcoins is up to you. You can have a coffee together first to build up some trust.
The safest way to store bitcoin is in a paper wallet split over several keys with something like passguardian, or [this tool I made]( 
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:13:51
Oops, I didn't realize I was responding to you. I made sure to read [the proposal]( before responding again.


I don't see why that would be true. If propagation reliability is R, I would expect |B-P| = (1-R) * (|B| + |P|) = O(B + P). Why would it be O(1)?


They could even start mining and relay after only receiving the block header, right? That would definitely make it O(1). Would the [incentive not to propagate transactions ahead of time]( be gone in a IBLT world such that this extra optimization could work?


How can they know in advance for which transactions they need to include the data? Edit: I see it's a property of the IBLT that it includes data for all transactions but only a small number can be retrieved after most are deleted.

Yes, the anonymous account would be accessible to anyone with the link. It should be fine if the link was only sent to one person. There shouldn't be much money in it anyway.
It would let you withdraw or create new links, and maybe even deposit. But I'm not sure how you would collect more tips into an anonymous account. If people want to do that, they can register.
Making it work with reddit would be good too. In this case I would also make sure the reddit user can use the service without signing up. For example, an "anonymous account" could be tied directly to the reddit account. So you would always send the same secret link to the same reddit account and that gives them access to anything that's tipped to that reddit account.

You say it sucked that your bank account got closed after 5 years. So clearly 5 years was not long enough. How then, can you propose anything shorter than 5 years? I honestly don't see why accounts can't stay open for as long as you're in business. But I'm not saying the account has to remain open. I'm only saying you should hold on to the funds so that you can return them when the rightful owner requests them.

Coinbase is not a wallet. They have no guarantee of fast transactions. You might have to wait for the coins to come out of cold storage.

It mostly depends on yourself. With paper wallets it depends completely on yourself. With Coinbase there is also a chance that you don't do anything wrong but they get hacked. So it really depends on questions like "how likely are you to lose a piece of paper" or "how likely are you to download malware to your computer". There are many things you can do to make you safer, but what is safest in the end depends on how you use it.

You should use the features of BIP32 to have an online counter part of your wallet with a small spendable amount for convenience. It would also have the public extended master key to watch the wallet without being able to spend it. And maybe only use the offline wallet to occasionally replenish the online wallet. BIP32 also allows you to generate addresses without having access to their private keys.

Does your change actually prevent any of those transactions going into the blockchain? As far as I understand (and correct me if I'm wrong) as long as not (close to) 100% of the nodes use your patch this will only slow down propagation of those transactions but not actually keep them out of the blockchain, correct?

This is the right answer but I'd be afraid the transaction might not be recognized in 20 years and you can't create a new version without the private key. I'd hope they keep it backward compatible but I wouldn't bet a lot of money on it if I didn't have to.

I think Bitcoin is less fungible than paper dollars. So far everybody is treating all bitcoins mostly the same but they are actually all uniquely distinguishable and anyone can decide to start not accepting any bitcoin for any reason at any time.

It's minimal, but not zero. If you've never spent from an address, all that's known to the network is the address. This is the hash of the public key. The public key itself is actually not public at this point. But in order to spent form an address, you have to publish the public key as well. This slightly increases the attack vector of the address and this is why some people prefer never to use an address more than once.
As I said, the difference is really minimal, but it's not zero.

I paid with Bitcoin in a shop for the first time a couple of days ago. It was also the first time for the girl behind the counter and she didn't actually know how it worked either. But on the screen was just an input field to enter an amount so she enter the amount and pressed a button. Then a QR code showed up so I scanned it and paid. Then she said "that was easy!". Based on that experience I don't think staff really needs to be trained.

I was once "tipped" $50 by Bitfinex.
I exposed a bug that caused people, including me, to lose interest payments. First I was told it was not a bug, even though at the same time it was admitted that payments had failed. Then I was asked if I wanted the money back (why not give it back immediately?). Then I was ignored for more than a month before I got my money back plus $50 for the trouble.
The $50 really wasn't necessary, though appreciated, but it strike me as a bit weird to give 3 times as much for a typo as for a bug that causes people to lose money.
(The amount I lost was very small. The amount was not important, but that fact that money was lost at all is very serious in my opinion.)

"It could be tested" is definitely hand-wavy.
"It has been tested" is much less hand-wavy but it could easily appear O(1) in practice at small scale while at larger scale it's still O(n).
And is hashing the block still O(n)? Or is it O(|B-P| * log(n)) because of the Merkle tree?
In any case, I think |B-P| should be assume to be O(n) unless there's a good argument as to why it isn't (why R wouldn't be a constant factor).

No, it's because most nodes have already seen most transactions.

It's still not clear to my why this difference would be O(1), but it's clear that this difference is much smaller than the complete block.

If transactions are approved from another device, it doesn't matter how secure your BitStash is. If the authenticating device is compromised, you're still toast.

I'm not stuck, because I didn't invest money I can't afford to lose. I'm comfortably waiting for things to turn around. Occasionally buying a bit more with other money I can afford to lose.
If we had both bought at the $30 peak, I would now be very happy and you would have lost it all on margin calls on the way down to $2. That's why what you are doing is gambling and not trading.
And because you have a serious gambling problem, you need to stop doing what you're doing, talk to your family and get serious/professional help.

I looked at 
I clicked on 1.012 (covered) and then on "Covered amount". It filled in 82 mBTC for the amount and 82.98 for minimum winnings. I guess my "mistake" was to assume that winnings meant profit. I now think it doesn't mean that but it means how much you get back if you win. If so, that is a bit misleading.
So I bet 16mBTC. But then my bet didn't get matched, even after my transaction was confirmed for a while. So I realized I must have misunderstood what I was doing. But now, hours later, it turns out that my bet is matched. And the covered amount is now 66 so I guess 16 of that was matched against my 16.
How long does it take before a matching bet actually gets matched?

So it sounds like it's O(1) because we arbitrarily choose a fixed size IBLT. But this doesn't scale indefinitely so it's an artificial way to limit the amount of data that needs to be sent over the network.

It should be said that this can't help existing wallets. A wallet would have to be re-encrypted before becoming more secure. And even then you would have to move your funds to a new private key that didn't exist in an older encrypted copy.

A hard fork is required to change what counts as a valid block. Basically it results in two longest chains instead of one. One longest chain with blocks that are valid according to the old rules and one longest chain with blocks that are valid according to the new rules. It's called a fork because the chain splits in two.
While the reference client doesn't propagate non-standard transactions, it doesn't treat that as invalid. So if a miner creates a block with a non-standard transaction, this won't cause a fork.

If you have coins in an exchange, those funds don't exist on the blockchain. When you sent the coins, the coins didn't leave the blockchain, of course.

And transactions made on the exchange don't exist in the blockchain at all.

If you read my post, you'd know that I don't think the backing itself is relevant. I'm only explaining what it is.
You have not backed the dollar by gold because you have not provided the rate at which it is backed and you have not set aside the appropriate amount of gold (which is impossible).
An infinite number of dollars is indeed impossible. But there is no finite amount that *you* can guarantee to stay below.
@_date: 2014-11-16 19:11:04
Mining used to be done with normal computers. But that time is gone. A normal computer wouldn't mine a penny for the cost of $1 in electricity. So you need these specialized hardware chips and most manufacturers take pre-orders and then never ship, or ship when the hardware is already worthless.
Then there are these supposed "cloud mining" services where you pay money for someone else to mine for you. But people seem to think that they are mostly ponzi schemes.
If you do end up with actual mining hardware, you're still lucky if you manage to make back your investment before the difficulty increases too much. And you need to be able to get electricity at very low cost to do that.

If you buy altcoins, you're not putting your eggs in a different basket. You're just putting your eggs in a less safe place of the same basket. If you really want to diversify, you should consider gold, stocks, real estate, art, etc.
The problem with altcoins is that there's an infinite variety. One of the attractive things about Bitcoin is that there's a finite amount that will ever be created. But if you include altcoins, this is no longer true. Bitcoin may not be around a decade from now, but you can rest assured that whatever random altcoin you choose won't be the one replacing it.

I used a very simple strategy where I keep the value of my fiat and BTC on an exchange roughly equal. When the BTC price changes more than a certain percentage, my program would automatically buy or sell enough to make the values equal again. The result is that if the price keeps going up and down you make a tiny bit each time. It was fun but not very profitable.

Coinbase charges a 1% fee. This is only waived for the first $1,000,000 in transactions. This may seem like a lot but especially for low margin businesses it's not that much.

I have absolutely no problem with the 1% fee. I think it's much cheaper than paying miner fees on the blockchain and I understand that the developers need to make a profit.
If all linked accounts are deleted, and there's really no way for anyone to claim the coins, then I don't really care. Returning it to the sender is a nice idea but can also get complicated. But it's hard to prove that it's impossible for the owner to prove their identity so personally I would just keep a record somewhere. There's no need to keep the account live, just make a tape backup of all the disabled account or something. It really doesn't need to cost anything to keep this data and the coins around.
The privacy part is also disturbing. I think it needs to be clear that there is no intention to sell or monetize personal information without explicit consent from the user. From the ToS it seems to opposite may be true.

Bitstamp charges 0.5% but after trading $50,000 it's already down to 0.3%. I don't know about Australian exchanges.
To guard against the risk of the price changing you should first transfer part of the money as bitcoins. Then you sell those at the same time you buy more for your AUD. Transfer those to the other exchange and repeat until the entire amount is transferred.
The fees for transferring should be 0 or tiny. Bitstamp charges 0.90 for a SEPA transfer but SEPA transfers are up to 50,000 Euro I believe.

A *single point of failure* is a technical term that describes a part of a system that, if it fails, will stop the entire system from working. You should always try to avoid single points of failure by making all parts of your system redundant. A system can, however, have multiple single points of failure. And indeed, you seem to have identified 2 of them here.

To me, having only one product on a site is not something I'd pay extra for. Once I have the sticker, I can't see how many products were on the site. I'd just want it to look good and last long.

The reason you make a profit from the bitcoin price increasing, is because you bought bitcoins with the $350 that you borrowed and now those bitcoins are worth more.

What do you mean by "save up"? They would have to sweep the wallets immediately to make sure nobody else does.
But sure, you could walk around with just paper wallets in your pocket and to pay a merchant, they could sweep one or more of your paper wallets and send back the change to another paper wallet.
I think it would be great to have standard infrastructure for this. A wallet app could print special QR codes that combine a private key and a change address and merchant apps could support sweeping and sending change back, That way you could use your printer at home instead of an ATM to withdraw paper money.

That's not true. When the dollar was backed by gold, anyone could decide to value the dollar higher than the amount of gold it was backed by. That wouldn't mean that it was no longer backed by gold, or that the US was forced to acquire more gold for the dollar to still be backed.
If I decided today to back bitcoin by 12 billion Euro, the price of bitcoin could still go higher than my backing suggests. That doesn't mean it's no longer backed. The backing only guaranteed a minimum value.

I see. If they did have access to a vulnerability, they could start using it slowly, more and more over time. Once people realize what's going on, there's no single point in time to point to for when it started happening.

But even in the sense you mean it's perfectly possible to create bitcoins. A bank can just give you an account with a number that says how much money you can withdraw. As long as not everybody withdraws at the same time they can make the sum of the numbers larger than the total amount of money in their shoe box. In this sense bitcoin is no different than other money.

Yes, all you need is your phone. But do make sure to make a backup before you receive any coins to it. The backup is just writing down 12 words so that's easy. But make sure you never lose those 12 words and never show them to anyone else. You probably want multiple copies in multiple places, in case something happens.
A paper wallet is a piece of paper with a Bitcoin private key on it. All you need to get your Bitcoin is this private key. So if you don't need to spend them for now, a piece (or multiple pieces for backup) of paper is all you need. It's safe because it can't get hacked over the internet like a computer or phone. It safest if the computer that created the private key, never connects to the internet.
@_date: 2014-10-02 21:16:59


That's good in theory, but it means you have to create a new paper wallet every time. People are too lazy for that and you don't want to do that with high quality "paper" wallets.

A question is not a proof. And the fact that I can't prove the opposite isn't a proof either.
Did you read the signing algorithm? The message hash is represented as *z* and the private key as *d_A*. The signature is
*(r, k^-1 (z + r d_A))*
I can compute this without knowing the private key, *d_A*, if I know *r d_A*. I can probably derive *d_A* from *r d_A* so this may not help much. But I don't *need* to know *d_A* if I know *r d_A*, which supports my point that it's not strictly necessary to know the private key to sign a message.
The existence of this algorithm also doesn't mean that there's no other way to sign a message.
For example, the normal way to get a public key is by multiplying a private key by the generator point. But BIP32 defines a way to generate a public key without knowing the private key. So just because there is one way to compute a public key, that doesn't mean it's the only way.

If you have to pay N% tax over the sold amount, you have to sell 1/(1-N/100) as much to be left with the amount you needed.
For example, if you bought at $100 and now the price is $400 and you have to pay 16% over the capital gains (no idea if those are correct numbers), then you have to pay 12% over the sold amount (since only 75% of the amount is capital gain). So if your coffee is $4, you owe $0.48 in tax and thus you need to sell for $0.48 / (1 - 0.12) = $0.55 to cover both the tax for the coffee (12% of $4 = $0.48) and the tax for the tax (12% of $0.55 = $0.07) .

Thanks. I agree with the other comments.
There are also a few mistakes/inaccuracies. This may be fine to simplify things but I thought I'd list them just in case.
1. Not all miners are nodes and not all nodes are miners.
2. The part about storing your coins suggests that the obvious way to store coins is in exchanges. But exchanges are not meant to store coins. That angle of explaining seems strange.
3. The cheapest way to transfer fiat money is by handing cash in person and this is free.
4. "fiat" just means "decree". Fiat money is money that is not backed by anything (like gold) but only exists by government decree.

Let's say I'm sending to address 1qwe**A**asd**B**zxc**C**rty**Z**.
Then the device may choose indices 5, 9, 13, 17, which are then displayed on the computer. So then I look up those indices on the address and find A, B, C and Z on the card and I enter 4QF7 into the computer?

A paper wallet is just a piece of paper with a private key on it. For extra convenience there's often a QR code as well but that's not necessary. Since paper wallets are good for extra secure offline storage, it's best if the private key has never been in contact with the internet. One somewhat safe, relatively easy way to do this is below:
1. Download this file onto your computer: 
2. Disconnect your computer from the internet.
3. Open a Chrome incognito window.
4. Open the file that you downloaded to your computer in step 1 in the Chrome incognito window.
5. Move your mouse until enough randomness has been generated.
6. Click on paper wallet.
7. Click print and print multiple copies of the paper wallet. Make sure your computer is still disconnected from the internet.
8. Close the incognito window.
9. Turn off your computer.
10. Keep the multiple paper wallets in different safe locations.
11. Use the public address (starting with a 1) to send money to the wallet.
12. Wait until you're rich.
13. Sweep the paper wallet into a wallet app when you want to spend the coins. Sweep the entire amount and never reuse the same paper wallet.

These coins didn't belong to DPR. They belonged to his customers and the time to claim those funds has passed. This has nothing to do with a trial.


You would see things like "500,000 to some arbitrary address that may belong to anyone". Why do you think you'd be able to see what they're spending it on?

1. 10% or 20% is huge with a fungible commodity like bitcoins. And it was unique to just MtGox. The situation was really not very different.
2. I know people don't think of the exchange rate in BTC per USD. It was just to point out that the bitcoin price has nothing to do with an exchange being more expensive than others because what's expensive for the buyer is cheap for the seller. The only way an exchange can be expensive is in the fees.
3. If Jimmy offered to buy your stock for $55 instead of the $50 the broker pays, would that suddenly make Jimmy more reliable? (If you believe your own argument, you'd have to answer yes.)
4. Comparing expensive MtGox bitcoins to fance brands? Seriously? Once they're in my wallet, every bitcoin is identical. Nobody cares for fancy Rolls Royce bitcoins.
5. I get what you're saying. It's just not a good comparison.
@_date: 2014-07-10 20:17:55
Yeah, what I meant was whether for each ETF bitcoin, an actual bitcoin must be held in reserve.
Though this doesn't directly mean that if the ETF bitcoin goes up in price because of demand, that Bitcoin will also go up in price. But I guess that the issuer would be able to do "arbitrage" by buying more bitcoins and issuing more units so that the price of the asset and the fund can be somewhat tied together.

It may be a small artist selling their unique creations from their home.
Alternatively, the merchant may just be cheaper than others. That will not immediately convince people to get bitcoins, but if it happens multiple times they may decide to look into it.

So is it like an exchange where people bet directly against each other and your site just matches the people against each other?
I still don't understand how the percentages can add up to more than 100%.
Let's say that I think the odds of something are 33% "yes" and 67% "no". Should I bet "no"? It depends on the odds, or on what other people bet. I wonder if it would make sense if I can enter my own odds and the site tells me what bet I should make to have the best expected gain according to my own odds. Or is that how it works?

If there were no traces of the private key left on the computer when the PC was connected to the internet again, then you are safe.
Heartbleed allowed someone to connect to a server and read some of that server's memory. So if the private key was never in memory while the computer was connected, then you are fine.

I was thinking about having a separate hot wallet in the BIP32 hierarchy because signing transaction offline every time might be tedious and BIP32 let's you have separate accounts in the same hierarchy in a nice way. At the very least you could use the public extended key to receive transactions without having to use your seed/passphrase.

While mining by hand is clearly not profitable, there's something to be said for having a paper wallet that's never touched a computer. Not even an offline one.
Too bad EC arithmetic is so much more complicated than SHA-256.

When MtGox was still trading at a premium it was probably because BTC withdrawals were perceived as easier than USD withdrawals.
But the important thing to take home is that you don't just get 10% more money for the same thing. If it seems that way, you better be very suspicious and make sure you know exactly what's going on. The fact that either kind of withdrawal is difficult enough to affect the market should be enough reason to stay way unless you want to take a big risk.

Wow, that's a really long comment. Thanks for being thorough.
Do I understand the following correctly?
If both devices (laptop and mobile) are compromised and connected to the internet (or otherwise), the laptop could send a malicious transaction to the BitStash and send the intended transaction directly to the mobile device. The mobile device could then display the intended transaction instead of the malicious transaction to convince the user to approve the malicious transaction to be signed.
Or did I miss something in your explanation that would prevent this from being possible?

Yes, of course you can.

This was clearly a bad bet for me. But a cheap lesson. I wouldn't have made the bet had I realized how low these odds were.

Of course I take full responsibility for using something I didn't quite understand but I hope you can make it clearer for future customers.

Complexity theory is not something you can test in a finite world. I'm sure it will be great for the network to have IBLTs and it will probably scale for a while so in practice it's fine to test and then go ahead. But O(1) is theory and you can't claim it without a mathematical proof.

Exactly! You have the same vulnerabilities as other 2FA systems. I wasn't saying that those systems aren't vulnerable either. I was just saying that:
1. You can achieve the same level of security (only being compromised when multiple of your devices are compromised) without a fancy hardware device, and
2. You can't claim absolute security while at the same time admitting to the same vulnerabilities that certain other systems have.
If you want to sell a device that provides a moderately high extra layer of security, with high convenience, that's fine with me. But you are claiming total and absolute security, which is simply disingenuous.
I don't think you want to build to most secure device you can build. I think you want to sell fancy acronyms to rich, ignorant business people.

The addresses and keys are based on public key cryptography. You should google that and read about it. It basically means that you can encrypt a message using the public key, but only decrypt it using the private key. Let's look at an example:
Let's say my address is A and your address is B. I can then write a message saying "1 BTC goes from A to B" and sign that message with the private key that belongs to address A. Because the message is signed, the whole network now knows that it is legitimate and the network considers that this 1 BTC now belong to you (to address B). Even if they have never heard about address B before. And because you own the private key to address B you can now sign a message saying "0.5 BTC now belongs to C and 0.5 BTC now belongs to D". Even though the network hadn't heard of address B before my message, because of public key cryptography, they can verify that your message can only be signed by the owner of address B and so now the whole network knows that the money now belongs to C and D. Makes sense?

For it to be money, it either needs to be its own money, or it needs to be backed by something else. But if it's backed by something else, you need to trust the backer.

I was thinking of tipping. Off chain transactions are difficult to do decentralized. But tips are often so small that you don't want to have to pay transaction fees over them. But I also don't expect something like changetip to be able to register for a BitLicense.
So here's my idea. Instead of people depositing to the tipping service, the tipping service only keeps track of intentions, or IOUs. This can work because tipping is voluntary anyway. When somebody has tipped a certain amount and it is time to settle their debt, they pay directly to another member who has acquired a lot of tips. The tipping service can see the transaction and settle the IOUs and balances internally accordingly.

It's conceivable that the blockchain will only be used for very large transactions with relatively high (in amount, but low in percentage) fees and that most small transaction all happen off-chain.

Yes, bitaddress.org lets you convert the private key to the public address. If those match, then it should be safe to send coins to that public address. Of course you should do this on your offline computer as well. And make sure your copy of bitaddress.org has the correct hash.

I just placed a bet. But now I'm not sure I understood it correctly. If I click "covered" does that mean my bet will be matched with an existing bet? Or does it mean something else?
This really needs an order book to make sense of anything.

No, with currency it's not like that. But the IRS treats bitcoin as property for the purpose of tax, not as currency.

I'd be curious to know the distribution of the volume over individual transactions. Given that the number of transactions is going up, the average transaction size must be going down.

Let's say I want to sign a message z.
As my signature I choose (r, s) = (z, z) and as my public key I choose Q_A = (z, 123) - G. Let's see what happens if we try to verify this signature.
w = s^-1 = z^-1
u1 = z w = z z^-1 = 1
u2 = r w = z z^-1 = 1
(x1, y1) = u1 G + u2 Q_A = G + Q_A = G + (z, 123) - G = (z, 123) where z = r
So the signature did verify. And at no point did I have a private key.
How about that?

I wired $20000 from Switzerland to the USA. First I had to open a browser; I use Google Chrome. Then I had to type in the address of my bank's website. I had to wait several hundred milliseconds for the page to load. Then I to clicked on the e-banking link to go to yet another page. There I had to type in my e-banking account number and password. Then I had to solve a 2FA challenge so I had to find my bag to get my 2FA device and wallet. I took my card out of my wallet and put it into the device, typed the challenge from the website into the device, typed my PIN and typed the result back into the website. Then I clicked on a link to make an international wire transfer, filled out the recipient details and hit send. Because I sent to an underdeveloped country I had to pay an outrageous fee of $2.

If $100 billion enters the market, that doesn't mean the market cap increases by only that much. For example, if everybody holds and only new coins are being sold, those $100 billion buy only 1.3 million coins, which means a price of $80k.

There's more than one private key for every address because there are only 2^160 addresses.
@_date: 2014-08-23 20:00:03
A master public key can generate a sequence of public addresses without being able to generate private keys. So this is a safe way to give out a new address to every customer without needing high security on the same computer. Then on a separate secure computer you can use the master private key to generate the private keys belonging to the public keys you used before.

It's already set in stone how much bitcoins will be mined. It's ridiculous to attribute that as cost of transactions. If the price of a bitcoin goes up that doesn't suddenly mean that transactions are more expensive. I don't care if blockchain.info calls it that. It's wrong.

I'm just guessing. When a broker gets more buys than sells or more sells than buys, they have to trade somewhere to balance out. For example, Circle may buy bitcoins on Bitstamp that they sell to their customers when not enough customers are selling to them. In that case it makes sense that their price is based on the price of the place where they buy/sell their coins.

If your computer is online, it could be compromised in a number of ways similar to a key logger.
It's good you saved a copy of the executable. I believe Electrum recently changed to a different kind of seed so it's possible newer versions in the future will no longer support your seed. Not likely, but possible. I'd recommend you make a second seed (with little or no coins on it) and try every 6 months if you can still use it, just to be sure you would also still be able to use your main seed. Just making sure your backup of the executable is still available, still works, is still compatible with the upgrades of your OS, etc.
If you're relying on family member, ask them regularly if they still have whatever it is you asked them to hold on to or remember. You don't want to ask it 5 years from now when they completely forgot.
Basically, you don't want to fire and forget but you want to regularly convince yourself again that you would still be able to recover your coins when necessary.

First of all I would recommend not to invest while you're still "fairly new". There are many ways to screw things up and there are many stories every day of people who got coins lost or stolen. Just choosing the right wallet software doesn't mean you're safe.
I have never used the QT client or Armory. Right now I have most of my coins on a shared paper wallet (based on Shamir's Secret Sharing) and a small amount on blockchain.info.

The seed backs up all accounts, not just one account. With normal use this means it backs up the entire wallet because there is really no reason to create single addresses. I guess that's just a legacy feature because it's how Mycelium used to work.
Was there a particular reason you created single addresses instead of using the addresses from the account or creating a new account?
When you want to create a single address, you have to tap a button that says "Advanced" (Pro tip: Don't push buttons that say "Advanced" unless you're sure you know what you're doing ;-)). Above that there is a message explaining that HD accounts are derived from your seed. I guess it could be more clear and say that other addresses are **not** derived from your seed, but that's what it means.

It's not dangerous in the sense that you can lose money. But it makes it easier to analyses the blockchain and make your transactions less anonymous. It's not a huge deal but still best to be avoided.
It's mostly the privacy of the people sending to the address that's violated so you should do them a service by not giving the same address to multiple people.

Here in Switzerland there are 2 ways of buying bus tickets that I regularly use:
1. I can buy 6 tickets in one. Each time I take the bus I stamp the ticket in the machine and when it's used 6 times, I buy a new one.
2. I can buy a ticket on my phone using a mobile app.
I've used both ways but I find stamping a paper ticket far more convenient than unlocking my phone and using the app to buy a ticket.
I suspect I'd also find handing over a piece of paper to a merchant a lot more convenient than unlocking my phone, opening an app and scanning a QR code.
How much I'd have to trust the merchant in case I don't have a connection depends on how many different denominations I have with me. But since I can decide which denominations I have when I print them, there is a lot of flexibility.
It would be nice to have a system that could work offline but I don't think that's possible without a specific authority backing centrally produced tokens (like fiat coins and notes).

The problem I see with fractional reserve banking is the lack of choice. If you want the "safety" of keeping your money in a bank rather than under your mattress, you automatically opt in to your money being subject to fractional reserve.
My hope is that with Bitcoin it's easy enough to be your own full reserve bank, that lending out your money for interest (and being exposed to the risks coming along with it) is a conscious choice of the owner of the money, rather than the safe keeper taking advantage of your money.

Great work! I have some questions about the design.
1. Why have a ticket ID in the transaction rather than a different payment address per user?
2. Why a different URL for the content rather than making the content available at the same address and identifying the user by a cookie?
3. Why require a hash of the content? This seems very restrictive. If the content is dynamic giving the user the newest content might be simpler and better.

A proper cold storage hardware wallet should always have a screen to confirm the transaction you're about to sign. Otherwise you're still vulnerable to malware on your online computer. In my opinion you're better off using Bither on an offline android phone than using a hardware wallet that doesn't have a screen.

Sure, your paper wallet is more secure if you need more pieces. But you could also do that with 3 pieces of paper kept in different places, or another separate system. Tying the cold storage system together with the M+H system seems needlessly complicated. Even if you do use the same devices for that system, I wouldn't think of it as the same system but rather develop it separately.
Also, I wouldn't want my cold storage savings to depend on my phone. Yes, it's more secure but also easier to lose. Usually when you make it harder to steal your coins, you make it easier to lose them.

You need to make a transaction from the first paper wallet to the second. Any wallet application can do that. Do you have experience with any wallet applications or are you asking which one is easiest?

Sell 90 BTC today at $220 for $19800.
If BTC hits $100, use the $19800 to buy 198 BTC, lose 100 BTC to the bet and still have 8 BTC more than you sold.
If BTC hits $1000, you still have your $19800 and win 10 BTC more than you sold in the beginning.
So this is a win-win bet for dude.

You suggest that I don't take the bet, sell 90 BTC for $19800, wait for BTC to go to $100, and buy back 198 BTC. This way I end up with 108 BTC more than I started with. That sounds pretty good.
But compared to that scenario I would still prefer to take the bet. I would just sell an addition 90 BTC. So I would sell 180 BTC in total for $39600. I would lose the bet and pay up another 100 BTC, but I would buy back 396 BTC and end up with 116 BTC more than I started with. 116 BTC is better than 108 BTC.
So taking the bet and selling an addition 90 BTC is still better than not taking the bet and not selling an additional 90 BTC.
No matter what scenario you suggest that does not involve taking the bet, there is always a better scenario that does involve taking the bet and selling an additional 90 BTC.

2) You must always trust the software you use to some degree, unless you always read the entire source code of the software you are using. If you decide to place your trust in another wallet instead, you should create a new address with the new wallet and transfer the coins to the new address. You are right that if you just move you private keys, you are still vulnerable to anything that might have happened to those keys. If you want to take your bitcoins offline, you must generate your keys on an offline computer and never take that computer online again, or guarantee that the keys were removed from the computer before the computer came online again.
3) The idea is that their software encrypts your keys on your computer and they never saw the unencrypted keys. But I didn't read the code so when I used them I just had to trust that it worked the way it's supposed to work. Anything is possible.

That seems to assume he already lost his keys. But you can't burn coins if you don't first control them.
By the way, when you spend coins, you spend them to a little script that describes how they can be spent again.
The most common way is to an address, which means that the script says you need to provide a public key that hashes to the address and sign with the private key belonging to that public key.
But you can also spend to a script that says you can't spend them at all. You don't even need an address.

Nit picking follows:
Bitcoin has one central ledger of which everybody has a copy. A system could be more decentralized if everybody has a part of the data that all adds up to the total truth. For example, in a system with IOUs, it could be possible that everybody only keeps track of what they are owed. That could arguably be considered an even more decentralized system than Bitcoin.

You didn't understand what my x and y are. Let's say x = 300 and y = 50,000. This means you start with 300 BTC and 50,000 USD.
Now you say, if you do nothing "you lose a portion of your x BTC since it's now worth less". If you start with 300 BTC, and do nothing, you end up still having 300 BTC. You didn't "lose a portion of your x BTC".


No, I'm saying you start with x BTC + y USD and end with x BTC + (y + 800) USD.


No, I'm not saying this is a profit. I'm saying that this is better than ending with x BTC + y USD.


No, x and y are independent. In my example x = 300 and y = 50,000, so x = 0.006 y. But this is completely irrelevant.


I'm not asking you to compare selling 90 BTC to taking the bet. I'm asking you to compare doing neither to doing both.
Please forget the earlier disagreement and try to compare the two scenarios in my previous comment without trying to see how it relates to whether it's good to take the bet or who is right.

The blockchain does not contain a list of what addresses own how many bitcoins. It only contains the list of all transactions. So yes, to know how much an address contains, you would need to go through all the transactions that involve that address.


That part is in the section about pruning the blockchain. You can forget about transactions of which all outputs have already been spent. But the headers will always continue to grow. So in that sentence he focuses on how much the list of headers will grow. You need the headers to verify the proof of work in the transactions that you do care about.

It's definitely not a fair bet.
Sell 90 BTC today at $220 for $19800.
If BTC hits $100, use the $19800 to buy 198 BTC, lose 100 BTC to the bet and still have 8 BTC more than you sold.
If BTC hits $1000, you still have your $19800 and win 10 BTC more than you sold in the beginning.
So this is a win-win bet for dude.

Your loss comes from the fact that you are holding bitcoins while BTC goes down! It has nothing to do with the bet. You need to start and end with 0 BTC if you want to express your gain in USD.
1. Start with 0 BTC and 0 USD.
2. Sell 90 BTC, now you have -90 BTC and 19800 USD.
3. BTC goes to $100.
4. Lose bet, now you have -190 BTC and 19800.
5. Buy 190 BTC, now you have 0 BTC and 800 USD.
6. Profit!

Let's say we are trying to compare two scenarios: A and B. In both cases you start with x BTC and y USD.
**Scenario A**
1. Start with x BTC and y USD.
2. Do nothing.
3. BTC goes to $100.
**Scenario B**
1. Start with x BTC and y USD.
2. Take the bet.
3. Sell 90 BTC at $220.
4. BTC goes to $100.
5. Lose the bet.
6. Buy 190 BTC at $100.
**Now here are my questions to you:**
1. How many BTC and USD do you end with in scenario A?
2. How many BTC and USD do you end with in scenario B?
3. Which scenario is preferable?

Anyone who runs a full node has an entire copy of the blockchain. The blockchain is never changed, only appended to. You'd have to hack all full nodes simultaneously, to hack the blockchain.

I think you need to take the nature of the case into account in your explanation. Bitcoin is a lot of different things but probably not all concepts are relevant to the court case.
For example, it may be very relevant to explain there isn't a company you can go to to have a transaction reversed. But it may not at all be important to explain that Bitcoin is decentralized.

I didn't mean to give the impression that it was about persons, but you are right.
And technically transactions aren't even about addresses. Transaction outputs are just scripts that describe how the amount can be spent. In most cases such a script involves proving you own the private key belonging to the hash of a certain public key, and we call those hashes addresses. But the script could really be anything. It could give coins to the first person to find how much is 2 + 3.

They only store your keys encrypted with your password. So if your password is strong, they can't steal your coins. But if one day they decide that they do want to steal your coins, they can just wait for you to log in again and at that time send the password from your computer to their server. You most likely wouldn't notice this change in their code. So if they wanted to steal your coins, they probably could.


Companies like blockchain.info, Coinbase and BitPay will always want to run their own nodes. The important thing is that if at any point in time you don't trust any of them, you can run your own node and verify that everything is correct.

1. What you store is the private key that allows you to update the public ledge to indicate that you transferred the coins to another address.
2. Yes, you are.
3. Nothing happens on their end with your password. They send you an encrypted version of your private keys and your own computer uses your password to decrypt them.
4. There's no such thing as "actual bitcoins". There's only the ledger that records how many coins each address owns. The wallet is the collection of private keys that lets you change the ledger, and the software needed to do that.
5. Basically, yes. But technically a transaction lists exactly the incoming transactions from which you are spending the coins and it has a signature to prove that you are allowed to spend those coins.
6. We don't know. It's just very likely. You can always change the block by adding some more transactions and trying again.
7. A block doesn't need to be full. You can work on a block with 1 transactions, or 3 or 500. It doesn't matter as long as it's less than 1MB in size.
8. I'm not sure I understand. Once coins are spent, they no longer belong to the spender. But I don't think that's what you mean.

Why do I read the same thing every day?
If everybody would accept Bitcoin, there wouldn't be a need for us to convince anyone to hold instead of sell. It would be obvious. And even if stores sell bitcoins immediately, you don't know what the buyer does. They might be replacing their spent bitcoins as well.
And more stores accepting Bitcoin is more reason for people to own bitcoins.

You should assume all mined coins to be "dumped" (i.e., be part of the supply on the market). If someone decides to keep mined coins that means they have a demand for them and that demand would exist regardless of whether they mined the coins themselves or not.

This makes me wonder what would happen if the same transaction (same inputs and outputs) is transmitted but with RBF disabled. Wouldn't that replace the earlier RBF transactions?

MtGox didn't sell more expensive bitcoins. Exchanges don't sell bitcoins at all. They just bring traders together.
Today, if I have BTC and I want to buy USD. At MtGox 1 USD costs 3.8 mBTC. This is very expensive. So according to your reasoning, MtGox must be very trustworthy.
On the other hand, a month ago those USD I would buy for BTC would have be very cheap. So someone with BTC wanting to buy USD would say "Well, something is definitely wrong there, I don't know if I can trust that place."


It can't be. OP had BTC and wanted to buy USD. So to OP, MtGox was cheaper, not more expensive.

This is true. And because of this you can store your bitcoins very securely using multisig, without the need for a hardware wallet. If you're going to spend extra money on dedicated hardware, I think you should demand more security than just what can be achieved with multisig on a desktop and a mobile device.


I'm not sure what you mean. Can you link the page and/or explain what you're referring to?
Of course any product can be compromised, but I think one of the points of a hardware wallet is that as long as the hardware wallet itself isn't compromised, you're safe. But this isn't true if your hardware wallet doesn't have a screen. If you do rely on other hardware not being compromised, you don't need additional dedicated hardware.

Jesse,  I think listing the fork as an altcoin, even for 10 minutes, is reckless. Miners don't intend to split the chain and there is a serious possibility that the old chain won't make it. Confused people might sell their "BU" coins for cheap, not realizing what it really is. And when the dust settles, they are left with worthless BTC-C and peanuts they got for their actual BTC.

About 2/3 of a standard transaction is witness data. So including just 2 or 3 SegWit transactions should free up enough space to include one additional transaction to go over the 1 MB. 


That's why I mentioned BitFury specifically since they have already demonstrated they can mine a &gt; 1 MB block.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:28:04

Small blockers worry that huge transactions can take too long to verify because you need to hash it once for each signature. A SegWit transactions only needs to be hashed once in total.
What they are missing is that you can increase the max block size without increasing the max transaction size.

If you want a capacity increase, SegWit is not what you should be looking for. It's only a one-time paltry increase before capacity is limited again. A real solution to the block size limit is much simpler.
@_date: 2016-12-11 16:18:23
I agree with what you say, except your last point.
BIP39 allows for an additional passphrase so you can make it function similarly to a BIP38 encrypted paper wallet. That said, I would recommend to write down the password as well (and keep it in a different location) because you can't trust your brain (or any single point of failure).

If they actually wanted to do a block size increasing hard fork after SegWit, we'd hear more details about it.

I'm pretty experienced and I always recommend to check your system regularly. It's the same as with backups. You don't want to think your backups are safe and 10 years later realize that you don't even have a 3.5" floppy drive anymore and that the floppies are corrupt anyway.
I think it's pretty naive to think that you can think of a password once, not use it for 10 years and still remember it. Or to ask someone to hide a paper wallet, not think about it for 10 years and still remember where or what it is.
Also, I'd suggest giving the password to a different person than the encrypted paper wallet. I wouldn't want to tempt my brother/uncle/etc. to "borrow" my coins.

Coinbase is for buying bitcoin. It's not (good as) a wallet. They track what you do with your coins and can block your account. If you're lucky/careful and don't get blocked, your transactions might still be delayed which is very inconvenient if the merchant requires the transaction to happen within 15 minutes, as they often do.
@_date: 2015-08-13 06:17:32
If you include an input from a block that was created after the fork, that input and thus the transaction is only valid on one side of the fork.

Well yes, he recommends using it **with a passphrase generated using diceware with at least eight words**, which seems excessive.

I did ;-). BitPay's BitCore llibrary does support it. Here's my proof of concept: 


In what way will it become easier? The problem with multisig with P2SH is that you need all the public keys. Not just n, for an n-of-m wallet. So just having n of the word lists is not enough.

You don't need to monitor the big chain to create a transaction that's not valid on it.  All you need is to know at which block number the fork happened.

But isn't that the whole point of running a node yourself? Not having to trust verification done by others.
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:29:27


Not really. I would only apply their signature to the transaction that I intend to broadcast. So if they were spoofed, their signature simply wouldn't be valid for the transaction I'm trying to make.
I have a [proof of concept]( of this working. It's possible to sign only the hash of the transaction without knowing the transaction. And it's possible to apply the signature to the original transaction .
I'm very tempted to built this out further to make my own ideal storage solution but at the same time it feels like a bad idea not to rely on well known solutions instead.

[My current]( solution is somewhat similar to yours but has some flaws that your solution has as well.
As SteveRD1 mentions, you can't really test recovery. I find it very import to be able to regularly test my solution. I don't want to find out 10 years later that I used the wrong ink and it has all separated from the paper inside the sealed envelope.
Currently I have 2 times the same solution, once with a small amount of money. This allows me to test the system but even then I can't really test the real version.
And there is a single point of failure when it comes to spending. Since it's not multisig, if something goes wrong with that single transaction, you're toast.

OK, I don't know if 8 words is overkill for BIP38. But if it is not, then I would say it's not enough for WarpWallet.
Or do you count the need to have access to the encrypted private key as zero security compared to being able to attack all addresses in parallel?

If miners collude against the interests of Purse, Changetip, Coinbase, Bitpay, GBTX, etc., why would they decide to use this new altcoin?

Awesome work!


I assume this is about outgoing transactions?
What about incoming transactions? Can I rebroadcast a transaction of which I was the recipient in case it got dropped out of the mempool before it got confirmed? Assuming the sender didn't double spend, that would still allow me to get my money. I was wondering if there are any wallets that do that.
If I were BitPay, I would definitely be doing that on my incoming transactions.

Use BIP38 to encrypt your paper wallet with a long password that you won't remember. Put some copies of the wallet in some places and copies of the password in other places. They way you can only spend when you collect both a copy of the wallet and a copy of the password.

JPEG is a lossy format. That means when you store an imagine, it might not be exactly the image you created. With photos, that's not a problem because a camera sensor already has some noise itself and you don't notice some additional noise. But with images with areas with few colors and sharp edges, such as logos and screen shots, you can get unwanted artifacts in your image.
I actually noticed it in your image before I checked the format to confirm. It might not be very obvious but you can see it quite clearly if you zoom in. The parts that should be just one color have strange dots in them.
The better format in such cases in PNG.

This is definitely something to consider but not impossible to deal with. You just need to make sure that if you want to transfer on only one chain, you include an input that's only valid on that chain. Since we're aware of the problem we can prepare for dealing with it. Wallet software could refuse to create transactions that would be valid on both chains, for example.

Hi Ben,
Thanks for reaching out.
I already have a ticket (3050, I assume you can look that up?) with Mason. I sent the errors 9 days ago, and again as a screen shot (as requested by Mason) 2 days ago.
I understand that the recovery tool isn't meant to be used often, but I hope you'll understand I have to be able to test it to be confident about your service. As I suggested to Mason, I think a stand-alone HTML page such as bitaddress.org could be much more user friendly. Since it's already Javascript, it might not be too difficult to do.
If I die, would my loved ones be able to use the key card without knowing my password? Does that mean anyone who gets access to my key card can take my coins? Or does it depend on BitGo checking a death certificate? What if a hacker fakes a death certificate?
Not knowing all the moving parts scares me. Like how can I be sure a hacker doesn't contact Authy to change my 2FA password etc. Do you have a page that describes all the separate parts (key card, phone number, email address, password, death certificate, etc.) and in what combinations they give access to the coins and through what mechanism?
Having a secure system is great, but being able to explain and demonstrate why it's secure is also important :-).
@_date: 2015-08-09 21:07:54
That's a good proposal. One small issue is that testing the 2-of-3 backup seed requires reconstructing it, which might be dangerous. I'd be more comfortable with multisig than Shamir's Secret Sharing.
It's also always good to remember that even if you sign your transaction offline, depending on how you got the address to send to, the address might have been replaced by an attacker before you even created the transaction.

@_date: 2015-07-09 06:54:41
The main problem I see with this kind of incentive is that merging inputs is bad for privacy so you don't necessarily want to encourage that.
But I don't think the incentive proposed here would actually work because people have no real incentive to use their inputs today rather than tomorrow. If the discount is the same in the future as today, people might as well keep the input around since nothing is lost by not merging it right now.
If we do want to encourage merging inputs, I have another idea that might encourage that. We could tax each input by age. For example 1 satoshi per day. So the sooner you merge, the less tax you pay. We could even go so far as to allow miners to recycle unspent outputs once the tax would surpass the value of the output. That way unspendable dust outputs could all be recycled eventually.

No. It is only assumed that he could have sold the coins at market rate. The profit can be seen independent from the miner's decision to hold on to a certain amount of coin.
See it as if the miner made a profit in fiat and decided to buy bitcoin with that profit. The only difference is that instead of selling to make a profit and then buying, these two actions cancel each other out.
@_date: 2015-07-26 20:46:21
OK, if you consider negative profit to be a thing then my original comment


is clearly wrong. You can always make a (negative) profit. You win :-).
But your argument depends on difficulty not going up too much. But difficulty will always go up if it's possible to make a profit with non-cheap electricity and/or non-efficient miners. So sure, maybe there's a really short time when you can make a profit with non-cheap electricity just after a price increase or the release of super efficient technology, but generally difficulty adjustments make this impossible.

I can't answer that question for you because you don't know if I'm secretly part of Mycelium's conspiracy to steal your coins.

Electrum is not necessarily superior to Mycelium but if your phone was stolen, I would definitely create a new wallet and transfer the coins there.
The Mycelium source code can be read [here]( but it's not technically open source as the license doesn't allow you to do certain things.
I haven't audited the code but to the best of my knowledge, the privates keys are only stored on the phone and on the paper. Not on any server. So as long as you keep the phone and papers safe (which apparently you didn't as your phone got stolen) you should be safe.
The only way in which Electrum would be superior, is if you have a completely offline computer on which you use Electrum to create a wallet and sign transactions offline.

Mycelium doesn't let you choose a password when you create your wallet but Trezor does. And Mycelium can supposedly restore a Trezor seed.

Right now and until SegWit is activated, when transaction IDs are computed, the transaction signature is always included in the computation.
After SegWit activates, it becomes possible to create transactions such that you don't take the signature into account when computing the transaction ID.
So yes, it conceptually changes the way the transaction ID is computed. And that's the point of SegWit. What you are describing is exactly the clever trick that makes it seem to old nodes like it didn't change.

Like what? 
* The block size can be increased in a soft fork. 
* The average time between blocks can be changed in a soft fork. 
* The block reward and **21M coins limit can be changed in a soft fork**.
* The double SHA256 proof-of-work algorithm can be changed in a soft fork.
I can only think of one thing that would need a hard fork and that is changing the minimum PoW difficulty. Without a hard fork you always have to do at least an average of 4GH per block. But that's nothing nowadays. Everything else can be soft forked as far as I know.

If SegWit would be implemented the obvious way as a hard fork, it would mean changing the way the transaction ID is computed.
Through a clever trick, this is now accomplished through a soft fork. Sure, technically (following old definitions) it doesn't change the way the transaction ID is computed. That's why it can be done as a soft fork and that's why it's so clever.
But it accomplishes exactly the same goal. Conceptually it does change the way the transaction ID is computed.
@_date: 2016-02-05 21:19:03
You don't need to get all of the nodes to change their clock. Only a majority of the miners' clocks.
The difference between a hard fork and a soft fork is not whether it's comparable to all nodes upgrading their software. In a soft fork, new blocks are considered valid by old nodes. In a hard fork they are not. It's a strict definition and doesn't depend on your opinion.

The only reason they wouldn't be bitcoins is because we agree they aren't bitcoins. If we all agreed that namecoins are bitcoins, then they would be bitcoins. That's how consensus works.
It's exactly the same with the SegWit soft fork. The new outputs will look to old nodes like anyone-can-spend, but because we all agree that you have to look at the extra data to see the signature, in reality you can't spend them because your transaction to spend them wouldn't be mined. Or if it would be, the block would be orphaned.
Would you call the orphaning of such a block and attack? And is that attack orthogonal? It all depends on whether there is consensus for the SegWit soft fork or not.

Transaction fees are not the same as conversion fees. If you're going to convert to and from bitcoin, you're going to pay a lot more than 5 cents in fees as well.
And it's not just exchange fees. You should consider spread and slippage as well.

Yes, we were both wrong. 67% isn't never but it also isn't 100%.
But I don't know how you get to (1/2)^(48). To orphan 100 blocks with 25% hash power has a probability of (25/75)^100. This is "never" in the same way that you never randomly create the same address as someone else. It has non-zero probability but it doesn't happen.

That's not how it lowers the difficulty. It lowers the difficulty by introducing a secondary difficulty and then lifting that secondary difficulty when the difficulty needs to be lowered.
Later it jumps back and forth with the time, but it always jumps as much back as it jumps forward so it never catches up with real time. It is a real soft fork.

That's true if the probability of the event happening stays the same each time. But if the probability of the event happening gets smaller and smaller it's not necessarily true at all.
For example, if the probability that event X happens today is 10%, the probability tomorrow is 1%, the day after tomorrow is 0.1%, etc. Then the probability of X ever happening is not 100%.
It's the same with a slower chain overtaking a longer chain. The longer you wait the less likely it becomes.

@_date: 2015-04-07 07:18:06
Again: When you take a long position you are not borrowing bitcoins. You are borrowing USD.
For example, let's say you have $250 on the exchange. You could use 4:1 leverage to borrow another $750 and use the total $1000 to buy 4 bitcoins. The exchange doesn't let you withdraw those 4 bitcoins so as long as the price of bitcoin stays above $187.5, the loan is covered. And if the price approaches that boundary, your position will be close automatically to make sure you pay back the loan. So the exchange is never at risk of you not paying back your loan.
Now let's assume that the exchange lent you those $750 by running a fractional reserve. The price of bitcoin going up is not a problem at all. It just means that it's even easier for you to pay back your loan. The only thing that's a problem with fractional reserve, is a bank run. If everybody starts withdrawing USD at the same time, they might not have the USD ready that they already lent to you so they can't let people withdraw it right away. But in this case, the price of bitcoin is probably going down until people are happy to buy bitcoin and withdraw that instead.

OK, sorry that wasn't clear. If you losing $1000 would mean (a significant risk of) bankruptcy, I wouldn't have lent your $1000, so I wasn't considering that. If there is a high risk of you not paying me back, your IOU for $1000 will be worth less than $1000.


Thanks for clearing that up. The whole discussion started with the document from the Bank of England so I thought we were still arguing about their definition.
But let's try to talk about how money *should* be defined then, and I'll stick to just my opinion and ask about yours. I have a few separate points.
1. Do you think bank deposits are also IOUs and not really money? Or do you see a difference? I see a difference in the amount of risk but I see no fundamental difference.
2. I wouldn't lend you $1000 if I were planning on spending that money myself (in the relatively near future). And you probably wouldn't borrow $1000 if you were not planning on spending it. So regardless of whether your IOU is considered money, the act of lending does bring money into circulation and contributes to inflation. I think that's an argument for calling lending the creation of money.
3. If we go back to history, at some point gold was the canonical money. Then people started to keep their gold in banks and instead used gold deposit notes (bank notes) to facilitate trade. Would you call those gold deposit notes money or just IOUs? At some point the dollar was also basically a gold IOU. So if an IOU is not money, then the dollar at the time also wasn't money. Now that the dollar is off the gold standard, a dollar has basically become an IOU for nothing.

If losing just the $1000 I lent you means bankruptcy, then there was a high risk to begin with. I'm assuming you have a job or the skills to find one that allows you to save $1000 and pay me back. Even if you dropped $1000 in a fire once. If not, I should consider the money lost the moment I gave it to you, and then it's closer to a gift than a loan.


Most people would disagree but I'll go with this for now.


By "bringing info circulation" I mean that the money that was hidden under a mattress was just collecting dust and not actually in circulation. Once I lent it to you and you spent it, it was brought into circulation. This is actual money, even if the IOU you gave me in return isn't.


That's not really a satisfying definition. A currency can take many forms. Coins, bank notes, bank deposits, etc. You need to be specific. Also, in your previous comment you said you didn't care about official definitions so I'm surprised that now you care about what's an official currency.


So when I make a wire transfer to your bank account, this has nothing to do with money? Or when I use my debit card in a shop to pay from my bank account? How do you consider this?


Sorry, but this is a circular definition.
Forgive me if this sounds a bit condescending, but you sound like you've been indoctrinated to think that there's something special about the little pieces of metal and paper we call currency. Actually, we probably all have been indoctrinated like that. But this is the perfect forum to realize that and undo the damage. Money is just a number to your name. This number can be kept track of by holding little physical tokens, or with a number of a database. As a user of bitcoin, you obviously understand this.
If you want to define money as *literal money*, please define *literal money*.


Oh, but it is. When the Fed creates currency, most of the time it's also just an IOU in the form of a number in a database. There is literally no difference in the mechanism by which the money is created. They just have different kinds of customers.
The coins and bank notes are a tiny fraction of the money supply. Even if you only count money that was officially created by the Fed.


I believe it no longer is. At least in the UK. I'm not certain about the US. But if it were kept constant, then you are right that banks can only create additional money when the Fed creates additional money (or people decide to use less cash and more electronic money).

Thanks. I don't really worry about the debt. I do pay my credit card bill every month without problem without the need to specifically set aside money.
My main problem is having to use an outdated and insecure payment system. And my main point was that Bitcoin doesn't provide credit, it does compete with the payment system. I guess I could have phrased it better.

OP says he lends in bitcoin because he wants his bitcoin amount to stay the same or go up. I tell him he can't count on that if people have to default when bitcoin suddenly goes up. And then you come and say there are protections against that.

That's because all multisig sites use p2sh. But it's technically possible to do multisig without p2sh. Multisig has existed longer than p2sh. It basically means that you spend directly to the redemption script instead of to a p2sh address. Then the redemption script is right there on the blockchain and all you need is 2 private keys.

You could put it in the blockchain. [There are lots of things stored in the blockchain](
But even if you upload it somewhere where it's always available, you need to remember how to find it. Would you upload the link to it as well to the same service? ;-)
Since you need to keep at least some of the private keys anyway, I think that's really your best option.
In general, if you don't want to lose something, the best way is to have redundancy (a copy in Gmail, Dropbox, Blockchain, Storj, etc.) and to regularly check (with a recurring calendar event reminder) if it's still available. Don't upload it once and then forget about it for 10 years, hoping that it will still be there.

But the other companies provide value to the network that isn't (completely) dependent on the price of bitcoin. It could potentially make sense to invest in them. Especially if you also invest in bitcoin, because the existence of those companies benefits the whole ecosystem.
But monopolizing the bitcoin mining space, doesn't benefit the ecosystem at all and completely depends on the price of bitcoin. I don't think VCs are that stupid, but maybe they are and then it's their loss.

Is this all future sales over the entire life time of the company? Or just the first batch of devices? So if you manufacture the device for $40 and sell for $50, that means the net sales per device are $10? 1% of that is $0.10 per device. So for this 100 BTC (~25000 USD) to be a good investment, you would have to sell over 250000 devices. Is my example correct?

On an exchange people can put in buy orders or sell orders indicating how much they are willing to pay for bitcoins or for how much they are willing to sell bitcoins. When a buyer and a seller agree on a price (facilitated by the exchange) the trade happens and the price of bitcoin and that moment is established.
When more people want to buy bitcoin, they may have to bid more to be able to get the bitcoins they want and the price goes up.
When more people want to sell, they may have to accept a lower price to be able to sell and the price goes down.

A good cryptographic hash function should be indistinguishable from random as long as it gives the same output for the same input. If you can prove that it takes a certain value, it's no longer random so that means some kind of vulnerability.

Thanks for the tip!


I see. So how do I know someone really lost the private key and didn't just prefer spending my coins over spending their own?
How about giving the underwriter an **nLockTime** transaction to spend the insured coins after the insurance period expires? In that case, if the policy holder really lost the private key, the underwriter can simply spend the lost coins after the time is up. And if they didn't lose their key, they can transfer the coins into safety before the nLockTime transaction becomes valid.


I don't see any other option than making the underwriters also custodian in some way. Maybe multiple underwriters could all be parties in a multisig wallet so no one underwriter can run away with the coins.
What makes your service so confusing to me is that while the idea is to facilitate deals between policy makers and underwriters, at the same time you also need to provide a guarantee that the underwriter doesn't lose their money. How do you give that guarantee? And if you can, why not provide that service directly to the policy holders? Maybe there shouldn't be a deal directly between policy holder and underwrtier, but instead underwriters can invest in your service and their money becomes a pool from which any policy holder can be paid.

I don't know of any tools that do this. But p2sh means that the address is the hash of the output script. The output script contains all the public keys. This was the way to do multisig before p2sh. But now that you only have the hash of the script, you need to provide the script when spending.
You can read about the script language here:

Today you might have your savings in a bank and daily spending money as physical cash in a wallet. That makes your spending money "real" and your savings "virtual".
But in a Bitcoin world the opposite may make more sense. Keep a small amount of spending money in an off-chain "bank" for easy spending, and keep your savings on the blockchain for safety.
That way you could still have some fractional reserve banking but much less.
But I think the most important thing (regardless of whether you use fiat or bitcoin) would be to give people a choice. Either use a full reserve account and pay for the privilege. Or you lend out your money to the bank and get something in return. The risk you take is based on the choice you make. The problem is that today full reserve bank accounts don't exist and people aren't even aware of the risk they are taking, nor can they do anything about it.

It's a payment network like credit cards but without fees and without charge backs. A small but growing number of consumers prefer this payment method because they don't need to give up their credit card number to pay this way. If you start accepting Bitcoin before your competitors do, you might even attract some new customers (Bitcoin fans) because of the novelty.
If this sounds interesting, contact BitPay. They can help you get set up for free. And they can also convert bitcoin directly to USD at no cost to you so you have none of the risks of dealing with Bitcoin.
PS. I'm not affiliated with BitPay or Bitcoin. Just an enthusiast who would like to see more choice in payment options.

That's what I was telling OP, isn't it?
But I wasn't even talking about speculating and arbitrage. Just holding a large amount of any currency (even the one of your home country) is an investment with risk. If you have assets it's impossible not to have risk. But not everything is equally risky and Bitcoin is definitely too risky to keep a large amount of money you can't afford to lose.

Thanks for clarifying. Yes, one backup per copayer would have been clearer.
Why do I need to protect my backup with a password? A backup is a last resort and personally I'd be more comfortable keeping the backup in a safe place than having to remember a password that I rarely use. I guess I could write the password on a piece of paper but it just doesn't seem necessary to require it in the app.
For me the best would be to have a BIP39 word list and a list of BIP32 xpub keys (and a link to the BIP45 spec). Using standards like that mean that even if I can't get a copy of this particular version of Copay to restore my backup, I will still be able to recover using standard tools. I have no idea what format Copay uses for backups and requiring backups to be encrypted also makes this harder to figure out.

Since miners will compete for a (mostly) fixed number of coins per day, the amount of money spent on mining will tend to approach to amount of money created by mining: ~3600 BTC per day.
Mining costs mostly consist of hardware costs and electricity. So the amount of electricity used would mostly be proportional to the price of a bitcoin.

You're welcome. Please note also that the key that you keep on a piece of paper should also be created on an offline computer. Ideally the computer would never be online again but at least you must make sure that any trace of the key is removed from the computer before it goes online again.

I think the simplest is to store a copy of all public keys with each of the private keys. Then anyone who has at least one private key can create the redemption script.
Edit: Another way is not to use p2sh but to create a multisig output directly. Then the public keys are part of the output and you don't need anything else but 2 of the 3 private keys.

Kind of the point of a physical coin (even if only symbolically) is that you can use them to transfer bitcoin offline. If you have to check the blockchain, that completely defeats that purpose.
But even so, if I would buy such a coin second hand, how do I know that the certificate belongs to the coin? I can check the blockchain for the address, but since the address is not on the coin, I can't know if it is the address belonging to that coin.
I know they are not meant for transacting, and that you have no choice to fund them without a money transmitter license. But still disappointing.

The coin is just a piece of silver with a private key behind a "temper proof" hologram. The address associated with the private key doesn't contain any bitcoins. So even though the coin says "0.1 BTC" on it, the coin has very little to do with Bitcoin, until someone sends bitcoins to that address.

My best guess so far for the sloped lines is tiered storage mechanisms for large services like exchanges.
Imagine a system where incoming transactions go straight into cold storage, and every time the hot wallet runs low, coins are transferred from (the oldest addresses of) cold to hot storage. Maybe the system is tuned to create a new cold address at fixed intervals or such that transfers from cold to hot roughly need to happen at fixed intervals. Or maybe cold storage is kept at 95% of the total assets. I think parameters like that could cause a sloped line. A change in slope could be a change in configuration of the system.

Isn't this maker-taker model bullshit? The only thing that matters is the difference between what the seller gets and the buyer pays. That difference is the fee for the exchange. If that fee is not shared between buyer and seller it just means you're artificially advertising a different bitcoin price with no actual difference in the trades being made.
For example if the Bitcoin price is $250 and buyer and seller both pay a fee of $1 (not realistic, but simplified), then the buyer pays $251 and the seller gets $249.
But if the seller gets a rebate of $1 and the buyer pays a fee of $3 and the bitcoin price is $248, it's the same: The seller gets $249 and the buyer pays $251.
So everything is the same, except in one case the price is displayed as $250 and in the other case as $248.
So there is no reason why this should increase liquidity, except if people are fooled.

Currently, there are several digital currencies implementing some form of proof of stake consensus
including Peercoin, Nxt, Novacoin, BlackCoin and BitShares. However, **pure proof of stake approaches
pose substantial security threats** that cannot be recreated in proof of work systems (including Bitcoin).
These problems are inherent to proof of stake algorithms, as **proof of stake consensus is not anchored
in the physical world** (cf. with hashing equipment in proof of work).


security issues. For example, the initial distribution problem can be solved by using a timeconstrained
version of proof of work; double-spend attacks can be prevented by including information
about recent blocks into transactions. Still, these improvements can be seen as ad-hoc and incomplete.
Unlike proof of work, proof of stake consensus is not objective; the state of a PoS system cannot be reliably
determined by new users based solely on protocol rules and a list of blocks and other network
messages obtained from peers. In order to prevent long range forks of the blockchain, a proof of stake
system needs to implement weak subjectivity by combining protocol rules with social-driven security.
The social component of PoS systems weakens their decentralization and mathematical soundness.
As Vitalik Buterin puts it [20], “[A]ll “pure” proof-of-stake systems are ultimately permanent nobilities
where **the members of the genesis block allocation always have the ultimate say. No matter what
happens ten million blocks down the road, the genesis block members can always come together and
launch an alternate fork with an alternate transaction history and have that fork take over.**”


major problems with the straightforward PoS implementations, they are not yet widespread, making
it difficult to evaluate their security. Nevertheless, delegated PoS solves the “nothing at stake” problem
and prevents short range attacks on the system.

Yes, it is the same.
If somebody deposits $100 in a bank, someone else can borrow and withdraw $95 (for example). But if they don't withdraw (or if they deposit after withdrawing), the bank now holds $100 again, which counts as a reserve of 100/195 = 51.3%. So they can lend out another $90 etc. If they end up lending out $1500, that means they have a reserve of 6.25%, assuming none of the borrowers actually withdrew the money.

Sorry to hijack the top comment but there's just too much misconception in this thread.
What OP describes is simply **not how Bitcoin works**. The Bitcoin protocol is not a democracy where changes in the protocol are decided by a 51% majority in the mining power. Changes in the protocol are only decided unanimously, by all users, not just the miners.
If there is disagreement, the result is a fork and everybody gets to decide for themselves which side of the fork they want to use. So if 95% of the miners decided to change the protocol, that just means they create their own altcoin that nobody else wants to use. And they'll be wasting their mining power on a worthless altcoin.
The only thing that miners (kind of) get to "vote" on with their mining power is which transactions are confirmed (and which ones aren't) and who gets the block reward.

OK, let's imaging BTC is worth $1000, the BTC reward is 3BTC and the fees per block are also 3BTC. Let's assume the average fee is about $0.01. That means there will be $3000 / $0.01 = 300k transactions per block, or 500 transactions per second.
Visa currently does 2000 transactions per second on average. If Bitcoin is as wide spread as 25% of Visa, it's going to need a much higher price to support all that trade. But if the price is higher, that means even more transactions (at $0.01 fee per transaction) for the fees to be equal to the reward. etc.

Do you promise to implement this if the project is funded? Or have you already implemented it and will release it when it's funded? Or do you have no power to make this happen and is this more like a bounty?

Do you seriously think people want to use this system or is it more of a joke?

The lowest ask might be one million but the highest bid wouldn't be. So trading would stop completely and Bitcoin would die.

Note that the transaction never leaves the online part of the app. You don't transfer the signed transaction, only the signature. So the signing can't possibly change the transaction.
That said, any independent verification is good and welcome.

No. At any time they could decide to close your account. You don't want to have bitcoins just sitting in your account. Also, when you withdraw bitcoins, it can take some time before the Bitcoin transaction is initiated and you don't want to wait for that when you want to buy something with Bitcoin.

It's impossible to teach a 5 year old to keep bitcoins secure. You'll have to do some actual research for yourself. But I'll try to answer your questions.
1. BTC aren't located anywhere. There is just an entry in the ledger that says your address contains an amount of BTC. This public ledger is stored in every of about 7000 nodes. The keys that allow you to transfer those BTC, are derived from the 12 word seed and stored on your phone.
2. In any app that supports BIP39 and BIP44 you can enter your 12 word seed to access your bitcoins. There aren't very many at the moment but there will be more and more.
3. Don't keep more BTC on your phone than you would keep cash in your wallet. Mycelium is pretty secure but nothing is 100% secure. For larger amounts look into multi signature solutions and Shamir's Secret Sharing. For myself I followed this:

It's no different from accidentally generating the same address as someone else and spending their money.
Btw, you don't need to send to an address to burn coins. You can theoretically send them to an output that doesn't even have an address so they really can never be spent.

@_date: 2015-02-15 08:16:39
I agree. That's why I wrote my own code. :D
Note that the offline part can't change the intended transaction because all that's transferred off of the offline computer is the signature, not the transaction.

Oh, I see what you mean! But for me it says "Bitcoin Purchase Summary" so it does seem to be about buying bitcoins.
For me the first bar says "Fully topped-up. Time for tipping!", the second bar says "3 DAYS: $0.00 / $50" and the third bar says "1 WEEK: $0.00 / $100".
I did deposit some bitcoins 2 days ago, so if this was about depositing rather than buying, it should show something other than 0.

I don't think you understand how Bitcoin works. That's fine; keep asking questions.
Exchanges only exchange bitcoins for other currencies. They are not needed for transacting in Bitcoin. They can ask any fee they want but if they ask too much, people will simply go to a cheaper exchange.
If Bitcoin "blew up", there wouldn't be a need to use exchanges for most people most of the time. You would simple receive bitcoins as (part of) your salary and use those to pay for anything you want. In any case, the fee per transaction would never be a percentage but always a fixed amount per transaction.

The values on the axes are not address or keys themselves, but an ID based on timestamp. The actual address or public key is not represented in the graph so you can't tell anything about the RNG from it.

The point of an open decentralized network is that anyone can compete openly to be the best payment processor and that every merchant has a choice as to whether to accept payments directly or through a payment processor.

Try having 2 cryptocurrencies: one with inflation and one without and see which people choose. Even if you think inflation is a good thing (which I don't), there's simply no way to enforce it (once money has been set free from the government). Good money will always drive out bad money.

Mining is solving tough equations, but not just for the sake of it. Every new block is based on such a tough solution and that is what makes the network secure. When all bitcoins have been distributed we will still need new blocks to be created so mining is still important.
Blocks are not strictly generated every 10 minutes. Blocks are generated every 10 minutes *on average*. But when exactly they are generated just depends on when a miner solves the tough equation. The difficulty of the equations is adjusted every so often to keep the average around 1 per 10 minutes.

1) The main software used to mine as well but it was disabled because it no longer made sense to mine on CPU.
2) Every node verifies the transactions. If you run Bitcoin QT you also verify transactions but whether you are helping depends on whether you are actually propagating transactions through the network. For example, your firewall may prevent it from doing so. However, the verification done by the miners is more important because only what ends up in the block chain counts in the end.

How much do you think that 1 BTC will be worth by then? If the block size remains 1 MB (big if) you get about 5000 simple transactions in a block. Even with $1 fee per transaction, a cross over at that point would mean BTC is only $5000. Doesn't seem very likely to me.

That answers my question. My trades are $10-$15 so I only make like 15 cents per trade.
So when the BTC price goes up or down 10 margins, you need 1 BTC in reserve bitcoins or USD to be able to make those trades, right? Does your algorithm assume an infinite amount of money at its disposal?
My algorithm starts with an amount of USD and BTC at a certain ratio and then when the price changes by the margin (I currently use 2.5%), it makes an order to return to the same ratio as before (currently 20% BTC and 80% USD). This algorithm continues working no matter how high or how low the price goes, without having to add more USD or BTC supply.

A big problem with this device that I didn't see mentioned is that it requires the merchant to have special hardware. Do you expect every merchant to acquire this special card reader?
It's also not clear to me why you need 2 connections rather than one and just use the button to confirm the transaction.
Also, why have a physical connector rather than NFC?
So here's a suggestion for improvement: Use NFC and confirm transactions with the button.
1. You don't need to connect but can just tap the card on the reader.
2. People who don't have the card can get the same functionality from their phone with an app.
3. Merchants who don't buy the reader, can get the same functionality from their phone with an app.
I think  and  allow the technology to get popular without having the bootstrap problem of nobody buying cards if there are no merchants accepting them, and no merchants buying readers if there are no people with those cards.

When the price is relatively low on Bitstamp and high on BTC-e, I buy on Bitstamp and sell on BTC-e. Later when the relative price is the other way around I sell on Bitstamp and buy on BTC-e. Does that make sense?

No doubt. Just curious if they would come up with something.

Stop looking at MtGox. MtGox dollars are not real dollars.

I don't know what happened last year but the price usually goes down over weekends when banks are closed and people can't transfer fiat to exchanges. So I'm expecting the holidays are like a big weekend and the price will go down a bit.

But if they put something bad in the client, everybody can decide not to upgrade or to fork the client. They can only provide possibilities but they can't force anyone.

It depends how you use your paper wallet. If you use it on an offline computer to sign a transaction offline, it should be fine to use it many times.
If you use it by reading it on an online computer, you should probably not use it more than once.

Did you back up the seed of your 2nd factor authentication?
Did you verify your MtGox account with photo ID?
Basically, ask yourself does MtGox have any way of distinguishing you from any else?

I don't know preev.com but in general value is established by supply and demand. Demand has increased a lot since 2 months ago.

It doesn't really make sense. Maybe he's asking for a blockchain.info link that contains the transaction?
What's your public address?

With bitcoin anyone can be their own bank if they want. But most people don't want to be a bank.

Don't look at MtGox.

Could it be that OP wanted to make a transaction of 0.099 on the 24th but somehow the destination and change address got swapped?

Even just promising to pay the money later is better than passing on paper wallets.

The text in the green box at the top is confusing. It makes people believe that they need a US address and credit card. It might be clearer if you add a question mark at the end of the first 2 sentences.

This question doesn't have much to do with bitcoin. You always have to pay tax over your income, whether you receive it in money, cars, food or other perks.

From what I've heard from BFL this means that you will only get your order fulfilled when it's not profitable anymore.

Now that you've mentioned it, it's not safe for you to do anymore.
For anyone else it might be a nice idea :).

The starting amount was 100 billion. It got to that strange number because ripples get destroyed in transactions.

It depends how old the coins are.
But it may also be that Electrum requires a fee when the network wouldn't.

Nobody will (or at least should) sell BTC for PayPal because the PayPal payment can be reversed while the BTC can't.

You can send coins to any number of addresses. You can distinguish them because they are different addresses but there is nothing special about the change address except that you own it.
However, if at a later time you send money from that change address and another address in the same transaction, it can be retroactive deduced that those addresses probably belong to the same person.
@_date: 2013-12-07 22:02:46
The transaction has 12 sources. All of them got emptied by the transaction and somehow the destination ended up with exactly 500 BTC. I wonder what that means.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:02:32
I'm not sure. Google Authenticator might be more secure. But make sure to back up the seed or you will lose access when your phone breaks. Then the security might go down depending on how you store the backup.
@_date: 2013-12-27 10:01:56
I've been doing something very similar but with less profit per trade. How do you decide the amount to buy/sell when it goes down/up?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:12:55
I always restore my backup after paying for something. That way I can spend the money again. Works like a charm.

I hope you have several backups. The piece of paper will get lost before its time has come.

The splitting is equally secure (both based on Shamir's Secret Sharing). The security of the whole system depends on where the key comes from and how the parts get to paper and where you keep the parts. Did you read the instructions?
Actually, I don't know Passguardian but just had a quick look and saw it also uses Shamir's Secret Sharing.

You should never feel secure.
These are all small start-up companies. They can screw up or just disappear. Don't send them more money than you can afford to lose. And don't keep your money there longer than necessary. Keep most of your coins in an offline wallet and not in an online service such as an exchange.
Bitstamp does seem to make a good effort to be secure but you should never stop being paranoid.

View the source of the page. It's not much code. It creates random polynomials of order k-1 in the prime field of size 59 and takes n points on it. And it does that for each character in the key.
