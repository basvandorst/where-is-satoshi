No, if nodes don't approve a block, the miner has spent energy in vain. That's how Bitcoin works. If you increase the blocksize, you wreck the verifiability of the bitcoins. In the long run, there would be as many problems verifying if the bitcoins are authentic than the hurdle to know the purity of gold. That's the problem you propose to create. No, thanks!

You don't get it. The hashrate increased 43% since december. Mining is the greatest network effect behing Bitcoin. You can't undo investment like this, it's both a safety net and  a health signal.

It does not need to be a substitute now, but this is the method to get which transactions are going to be included in times of high demand, since the block needs to be limited in size, otherwise the blockchain size grows until no one can keep track of it.

Then why the price increased, hmm, 10 times to be modest? I'm sorry if you got caught in crypto-shit propaganda, but Bitcoin was meticulously planned to survive in long term. The fee gradually replaces the block reward as inflation exponentially decays.  
If there's extra space, miners just get the transactions that pay at least something in fees. Bcash still has fees and cannot claim it's better in this sense and Litecoin very rarely process feeless transactions - like once in several months, maybe that's different too know and they don't process feeless transactions at all. There's no incentive, the block miner choses what to include in the block, are you telling him to work for free? If he decides to include a feeless transaction, everyone can indenpendetly see that that transaction has been mined and everyone has an incentive to try it out and see if their feeless transactions also get in there. It does not makes sense for the miner to do it unless he is the one doing the transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:02:10
It's outputs per transaction. The way it was done is that some exchanges used a single transaction to make a single payment. When multiple outputs are in a single transaction, instead of 20 separate transactions, the exchange saves a lot of space in the block and pays less. [Here an explanation, better than mine, with cool graphs]( Unfortunately, this does not apply for multiple inputs.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:54:56
Then fiat is decentralized because it is so widely adopted. It's game theory that keeps the system working, not mob fury. There's no decentralization if the cost for running a node is high.

It will have its own incentives to miners, so miners also get some of these pegged tokens.
@_date: 2018-01-03 09:33:06


No, they cannot. The space in a block is limited. Raising it increases the risks of centralization. You can have your ID chain, but it doesn't mean it's going to matter in any way. Simple math helps, the blockchain shouldn't be used to host an ID system and most, if not all, "smart" contracts are useless.  
Cryptokitties? The question remains, are you serious? Bitcoin fees are needed because it is the most protected human registry ever built by humanity, no posibility of passing anything else as Bitcoin's blockchain. Fees have been stable at 1 mBTC, the only people who complain about it are those who lost the great price increase or wanna wreck the system.  
POS? Are you serious? No POS shitware could ever compete with Bitcoin because such system relies on humans not colluding, incentives for corruption would be too high. Ah, you don't consider the implications of a consensus system that's incorruptible! You clearly know so much about Bitcoin flaws that make me entirely trust in it.

Exactly, Bitcoin is perfection as a currency, you cannot rate how good it is, but how fast others are doing at empowering Bitcoin. If the world turned to gold tomorrow?

So, what is this tron-alt? Some people are so sure of their ideas, so dumb, that I can type this as I investigate this pile of retarded money. It seems they didn't presented their alt at Bitcoin Talk, they are so good to say thanks before getting the stick? Ingrateful. So, I go to the site and all I see are buzzwords, nothing special, some animations so it may fool the fool: "this is serious shit". But then it read "free content and entertainment with blockchain and distributed storage technology". If it is free, how would you monetize in a private blockchain? Retarded, but moving on.  


It seems they don't get it, scammers don't try to write a paragraph properly, so much easy money is floating around. Content creators cannot own content in a blockchain! Once it is out, anyone can set up a torrent and make it free. If it was a donation to content creators, then there's Youtube for that and I assume Tron is doing a worse job and some billions of dollars of inefficiency.  


Doesn't make sense, it is centralized in the owner, but that owner do not own the data! Who cares who proposed that? You think this is the first trial at monetizing content on the internet? Put a blockchain there and problems solved, that's what you think?


Now they claim they're competing with WWW while having the scalability issues of a blockchain? A blockchain, but it's supposed to be public? I wonder where this is going. 


This never happens, the elite always funds culture and thus, the simple people will be deprived from culture, limiting its own set of cultural choices, alas, you can't make up high culture with the simple people. Tron is attacking the wrong problem with the wrong tools.  
It follows with more buzzwords and reaches the epicenter of the scheme: the Tron token, mentioning some "standards" so the fool falls for the appearence of institutional propaganda.  
The Exodus phase is no better than another alt project - Sia, and is freely done through many services in the internet, notably, Youtube. Odyssey is not clear about its actions, a free platform like 4chan is very empowering, but they are not into that. Great Voyage is when little scammers join the scheme under the feathers of the big ones, no idea what are the advantages of the blockchain for "income measurement, divident payment and managment of supporters". Apollo is when the non-existing ownership of data in the internet is traded between the adopters. Star Trek is when they try to generalize their too broad aproach to already failing projects that were specific made for that then in Eternity, they sell the idea that the big numbers in the market cap of some industry are going to drop instantaneously in their project while there are other competitors more focused on that that are failing.  
At the bottom of the page I see who's making money out of that and that's all. It's a scam.  
Now, where's your list of reasons to support Tron? I support Bitcoin because it is the internet of money, it is capable of dealing with transactions of high value with no issues. Of course some want Bitcoin to buy coffe, but it does not does well in this area. No other project listed has the so much research about how to improve the capacity of the system without compromising its big selling features: trustlessness and decentralization.  
If you believe in content monetization, go for that, but don't come at the Bitcoin subreddit speaking about a unproven vaporware that only carries the Bitcoin tech(Not even that! I bet it's some POS crap) as a buzzword-justification to do what other failing projects had already tried. Blockchain(I mean Bitcoin, retarded people try to dissociate them) does not help that.

It's a hedge for the problems you described. Everything else dies out, by inflation, corruption, collusion, this is not possible in Bitcoin.

Privacy is an entirely different issue and of minor importance.

* Faster machines erase current miners advantage. If the game for faster machines is already over, competition is for lower electricity prices that will vary regionally and will give more advantage to places where it is easier to produce, such as close to hydro plants. Then if it is too profitable, it will be done with coal or nuclear and different regions compete. Naturally this will establish players locally but globally competition is still going on, as slow as this may be. It may reach an equilibrium eventually.
* Electricity prices vary throughout the year, thus mining might be profitable only in certain periods of low demand for electricity
* If prices drops, losses of a bigger miner are big and money went somewhere, bringing opportunity to non miners to mine.
* A bigger hashrate will give bigger miner larger bargain power, but the time to move machines might be very slow. Smaller miner can move more easily and will spend less in installations, both in time and money. Depending on the country, it may not be possible to move big amounts of machinery.

As I said, taxes and investments don't gather the same amount from the people.  
Bitcoin is not meant for the masses.  If you think any other crypto system can sustain the masses and make itself king, with the properties Bitcoin has, you're at least technically optimistic, most likely fooled by scammers.  
It is indeed a very Western thought that Bitcoin is for everyone, but you need to play by the rules, thus I do not agree with you on that either. People who buy Bitcoin without the knowledge of what it means, we can go on without them, it does not matter if it scares them or if they find it fluffy. The capacity to protect you money from any government and most thieves is unique.  
Surely capacity increases with Segwit and other improvements are going to help include more people, but it can never be a substitute for fiat in daily transactions. There may arise fiat which is backed by Bitcoin, but you'd have to trust the issuer. Meanwhile, Bitcoin will attract rich investors from a miriad of cultures who are willing to protect their wealth into something that cannot be shut down. It will also attract poor people who are able to use the system, but in a minor degree since poorer people are more risk averse than rich people.  
There's also the fact the money goes back up once it is spent by poor people, so, I doubt twice on your afirmation.

There no credit in hyperinflation because bank people aren't crazy and do not want to go further into bankruptcy.


Who makes loans in hyperinflation when potatoes are a better investment? You think everything works fine and people just adjust prices more often? Where there has been such a tame hyperinflation? Just in case, are you being paid by the Venezuelan government to lie about inflation? Hyperinflation means bankruptcy, hunger, disorder, impoverishment.
Government currency is so good a currency that it has to be forced on people, isn't this a sign of their inferiority? They are so insecure that legal tender laws exist! There was never a deflationary currency but gold was quite good, unfortunately gold is too good to coexist with social democracies, with politicians and their lies.

Yes, they'd be contributing for BTC because now that BTC is worth more, miners get some fees and these fees are worth more if BTC is worth more. OTOH, the shitcoins get dumped, as there are more of them on the market, it is harder for them to hold value the more coins are available on the market and so the fees miners receive are less valuable. It is an attack on weaker chains, miners there work as blood leeches. Miners are always blood leeches of the network unless they hold their coins but on smaller coins this is more so. It is the value of the coin that holds the blockchain, not the miner's hashpower, which is only a consequence of that value.

There's not only a single player in the market. Since most coins are just parked in the blockchain, no one can control the price and reap it all. Which rich people you're talking about? There are rich people in Bitcoin too and they're safely guarding the properties of the system.

You can't predict that the return over holding bitcoins is 10% before deflation happens, this is impossible to know. Money would starting flowing into investments once the return for holding is lower than that for spending, this would be an excess of savings, them we will go colonize Moon and Venus instead of having poor people in wealthy countries starving.  
Take for example the modern history of the US. If you exclude the great depression, there has been no great famine in its entire history and money was gold. I dispute your assertion that it is figuring out how to solve a problem now because americans owning nothing and being in debt is a recent phenomenon along with this famine. Maybe this is because they moved on from gold to debt.

It was already mentioned that selling the land for money doesn't really work. Food is costly to grow, it will take time, education and a person in a high inflation environment will be desperate. Renting doesn't work if demand is falling and prices are set again and again every month, it isn't possible to calculate return properly.


When a country decides to print its way out of debs, credit will not be available, certainly not from banks, only from your kin and friends. This small part shows that you never really studied about high inflation and how economies break under it and instead decides that all the evils of the world are due to deflation despite 5000 years of recorded history during which the only real economic problems were currency debasement (from Lydia, to the Roman Empire, Hungary and now Venezuela).

I feel inclined to answer you with a few more points. First, if more decimal places are added, the cap becomes a real number which can be divided as needed, 21 million being only a random number chosen without any impact in usability of the system but the hurdle to overcome simple math. As the number of decimal places is not an issue currently, this is an unnecessary optimistic worry. If there's a financial incentive, then it does not matter, users will deal with simple math as they're already dealing today. Second, the idea that there's only 21 million whole coins means, if it becomes the biggest currency, that most won't hold a bitcent, this is very humble in the system, as most won't even be millionaires in millions of satoshis.  Third, the user perspective is subjective, thus, you cannot generalize anything because if I, as a user, say that this is not a problem, you're refuted. Consensus is difficult to achieve in Bitcoin and that's good because it creates the reliability this technology needs to not be prone to attacks.  
If you want a unit, use satoshis, currently, one dollar buys 7700 satoshis! Easier?

I don't see how "unusability" is damaging the price.

QEs are far worse than any manipulation that is possible within Bitcoin. Bitcoin inequality is already set in stone, but that's not how it really works. Since it is deflationary, elites have a higher incentive to spend for things they can buy and savers have more incentive to hoard. Since there are more avid savers than elite, this leads to increasing decentralization of wealth.  
Meanwhile QEs assuredly increase centralization of wealth, enriching shareholders at the expense of the remaining(not directly but this is the effect).

You're saying an attacker would invest billion of dollars do buy mining equipment, to get a share enough to attack Bitcoin's network. Since it will hard-fork to another mining algo in a matter of days, in the worst case, the money invested on the machinery is guaranteed 100% loss.  
Out of this volume a few is leveraged money, mostly from Bitmex. There's no liquidity to perform this attack today, do you get this?

In a optimistic scenario where Bitcoin is the main cause to the Venezuelan economic recovery, socialists governments of any form will be blamed for losing the control to such an extent that they were completely ostracized from the financial system. Bitcoin doesn't help to collect taxes, so, this is the libertarian dream, if you forget how violent their population is.  
The main reasons I'm not so fond of this view is the technical difficulty of implementing scaling solutions currently(can be improved) and the uneducated, violent and untrustworthy environment they live under(unlikely to improve soon).  
If they are going full ancap, you expect security companies to arise but I doubt they have this sophistication. It is easier to establish monarchies since we know where they lead a republic to.  
Bitcoin is the bastard son of Austrian Economics. If it does help Venezuelans, then anything that applies to gold as sound money applies to Bitcoin and would finally give it some legitimacy beyond the criticism that it is only speculation. Keynesians like it as much as politicians do.

I read your text and gained more info about this attack. First, Bitcoin has to crash significantly so that the attacker can muster enough machines to be relevant in a situation where they are sold at significantly lower prices, then he opens a highly leveraged short position to one side and this also takes a huge amount of money because a small price increase will close the position and render the whole thing useless. There is some time going on between the initial fall(caused by?) and the machines begin turned on, unless the guy is buying whole farm, which would likely be announced publicly, but for the sake of the argument, everything is a shady as possible.  
So, he buys the things and open the short position. 51% attack only allows you to rewrite blocks, if the fall in difficulty isn't significant enough, it will yield nothing, it does not give access to anyone's funds, turn the current confirmation time to 100 blocks or something until normality and it's over. If is it is significant enough so that the attacker can rewrite the whole thing, which would take [183 days currently with the entire hashrate]( then an attack is expected and the safest for the future is to turn all this hardware obsolete. The likelihood of the attack is so high that a hard-fork is entirely expected too. This attack is basically a question mark to who will be the greatest sucker: a highly leveraged unknown actor or the most well protected registry ever built by humanity.

This is not this statement may or may not be valid according to the readers belief, do not project what you believe on me.  


Now you're contradicting yourself, you said human nature is to be dishonest.  


Predicting the future isn't the subject either. What happens if the price slumps? There's a lot of people here, some might fork to another algo and the thing is the same, this is actually the most likely approach if miners are leaving and 51% attacks are expected. There are some altruistic miners, maybe governments start mining to attack it, but in my opinion this would not yield great results.  


The price reduction may have an effect on the difficult, in this case the POW change could be a possibility, since the risk being avoided is the threat of a 51% attack. Now you don't consider that the person who attacks will make the blockchain invalid up to one point and the profit is dependent on the possible profit shorting it. It requires a lot of capital even if the difficult is a tenth of the current and it's a pretty risky investment since the exchanges can't hold such high transaction volume for it to be profitable. He'd have to deal in person to the richest Bitcoin holders while planning an attack on the whole thing. It's a lot of thing to coordinate even for a government and it can be ineffective or fail entirely in the end. I don't know how you thing someone is going to take the risk of doing this and getting out alive and with profit.

Too many assumptions for the current situation, you're talking about a drastic fall that is followed by another drastic fall caused by the attacker, of whom we don't know the hash power. [This site estimates Bitcoin mining revenue]( and revenue is still estimated to be 48% higher than costs, the numbers are all probably wrong, but it's educated guess about the mining conditions. One thing you didn't mention was exchange liquidity though. 
Also, the time to fork the network is not hard to get right since Bitcoin is forked over every week. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:58:31
Yes, this means that miner's profits are squeezing. It is unreasonable to think that, if the price remains constant, hashrate doubles or triples from the current level, thus, this halvening timing is wrong. Of course miners won't double their machinery all at once with the volatility the price has, so, it is expected that they grow it slowly as they can until revenue matches costs. This is what is happening, the year started with a 19% difficult jump but now we see it around 6%. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 09:52:44
Hello suninabox, let me oppose you again. 
Any fork which doesn't decrease the mining reward will have a higher selling pressure, thus, a lower value. Because current users bought something which they know it's going to inflate a certain way, offering something else is fraud.
But how feasible is this limit? If mining reward decreases, they stop mining as much as before, but this doesn't imply in attacks because their hardware is only compatible with few networks. Either they fork this one, creating a lower value coin, or they endorse another, which if it had a hashpower several times the size of this network, thus being a threat, Bitcoin could be merge-mined with it, though I doubt such would exist. If a powerful attacker wants to destroy Bitcoin, then a POW switch would make him entirely broke. What are the others Bitcoin destruction plans in your head?
If you say that only corporations are able to get their way in Bitcoin, that maybe be truth, but individuals could employ any tools to make their own version survive. While fiat reigns, it's in these corporations incentives to destroy the thing, or least aquire a higher stake in it, but as the their incentives coincide with the survival of Bitcoin, and that's what happens when you get too involved, they will behave just like normal users when you speak about increasing the supply beyond set, which is an excellent idea to throw around for any company trying to make money, isn't it?

[This site]( tracks Venezuelan Bitcoin volume. It is currently over 600 BTC weekly for the past two weeks, but let's be more skeptic and take only 500 BTC ~ $3.15 million weekly or $12.6 million monthly. From [this post]( it takes about $100 to feed 2 thousand Venezuelans there, I only bring this up because from outside, prices seems really skewed and absurd, but that's how it is.  
The minimum wage is about a dollar, it may increase a little because Maduro said, but this only means people who don't produce enough will be fired, but it's forbidden to fire people, so they give them money to bribe workers to fire themselves. You can see this whole inflation mess with Accounting for the most productive jobs, let's say that the average wage is $5 dollars in a country of 30 million people, that's $150 million monthly. Now I take from that the volume that is traded in Bitcoin, 12.6/150 = Bitcoin being 8% of Venezuelan economy, give of take a couple percent.  
The daily volume in Bitcoin is in the order of billions, of course a collapsed economy won't boost the price through the roof, they are too poor for that, but the argument that it isn't helping in anything is absurd. Venezuelan economy is a joke for Bitcoin.

Quantum computers wouldn't be more effective at mining, they could only attack addresses whose public keys is know, because they'd be more effective only at breaking the elliptic curve. They'd need to perform 2 to the power of 64 calculations to break it, which seems pretty safe for the blocktime of Bitcoin.    
Since public keys by default pass through a quantum resistant algo, RIPMD160, this means only addresses that the owner published the public key somewhere or that has been spent are vulnerable \(hence, don't reuse addresses\).

These aren't examples, these are applications you'd like, which is not necessarily what is going to be implemented. Bitcoin wasn't developed to give anyone lower fees, and if you think a global settlement in an hour is slow, I think your understanding of the past, dealing with banks, is barren, thus, you cannot see that this problem was already solved. Nevertheless, there's Bitcoin for these frenetic, generally low volume and low importance, uses too, which is the Lightning Network and without giving up decentralization. I won't comment about smart contracts on Bitcoin because any implementation of such hasn't led to any successful usage, but RSK seems to be concerned with this. Not being usable in the present does not makes it an argument, do you get what is an example now?

You stated that low interest rates with Bitcoin are impossible. They are possible, it needs a lending market and lots of savings, more savings would lower interest rates so it's possible to have low interest rates even with Bitcoin. Through empirical evidence, I showed that gold had low interest rates and you have to discount inflation to get the real interest, so bitcoins should be similar. Of course it is very immature for that, but many things are possible and this is one of them.

I'm not arguing for the sake of arguing, I genuinely believe everything I'm saying.


It would be good to any **liquid** asset, be it gold or fiat or bitcoin simply because you don't know if central banks will try to devalue to currency to keep the thing going.
Back to the Argentina example, they have some loans which use the dollar as index. When the currency devalues such as has been going on for now, these debts are much harder to pay in the local currency. It isn't as big as a problem than in Venezuela because they use two currencies there, the dollar for savings and the peso for dumping. Obviously, the most accessible loans are all dollar indexed, so you can see the advantage of liquidity, even if you lose some money due to inflation. 
The problem I see in our discussion is that I'm speaking generally and you stick to bitcoin and speak some nonsense about it. It is tiny, a green shrub in a decaying forest but nothing more than that. It might grow and become a huge tree but who the fuck knows?








Those castles would be sold for a profit until defaults prevented the project from finishing! It makes total economic sense what you said but when the world is filled with bubbles, you can't predict when money is going to run short, one "financial difficult" can lead to a huge collapse! Of course it doesn't matter for food and water, people don't use loans to buy food and water, I hope at least.






I was always talking about being **liquid** in a world of bubbles, it doesn't matter if it is fiat or gold or bitcoin. You might need to study a little of monetary history because bubbles where much rarer and the economy much more fluid and vibrant when real gold/silver standards were the rule, thus it is for the benefit of **everyone** that sound money should be adopted, if it is bitcoin or gold I don't really care as long as honesty can be kept, which is easier in bitcoin than in precious metals.

What? Land and real estate has been historically a good hedge against inflation, I'm only saying that it is overpriced right now and that people's debt with the banks, hugely in the real estate market, work to constrain consumption and blow the bubble. I don't know what Bitcoin has to do with any of this, I said that in a economy of debt, it might be good to be liquid when these assets deflate and no they aren't going much farther from where they are now so no big upside here.


You can rent a house. No point debating the importance of water and food, you'll prioritize this. It is strange that you mention food and water because this is the sort of investment you think about in a complete collapse, not when you're choosing to have profit from financial markets.


[REAL TANGIBLE WEALTH!!!]( Wealth is meant for consumption, but not when this consumption is fueled by debt, which inhibits future consumption. So no, land, labor and capital are of no use if no one is living in those small castles, just as digging holes and moving mountains won't necessarily make society wealthier.

It's good that we are trying to be fair to each other. Well, it's about the same thing!! Look, if the bank has 100u and lends a 1000u, making 50u of profit instead of 5u, you're saying that in this case everyone benefits. I disagree, the bank profits with this fraud but everyone else loses with higher prices(INFLATION) and the bubble this bank creates. This is directly related to how strong the currency is because a stronger currency will lead its holders to be more paranoid not to be MTgox'ed. Only a few creditors can retrieve their money with the bank, should a bank run occur, 10% of everything is safe with the most desperate, the bankers are hung and the rest are penniless, lest it be the case where the bankers simply refuse to give up, buy the armed forces and screw with anyone's claim to property. BUT you insist that without this scheme, people would have no jobs because there would be no investments, or at least this is what I understand or we wouldn't have economic growth:


Historically, this wasn't the case, Netherlands had the Bank of Amsterdam which was a rare case of a full reserve bank and it thrived with the little country throughout the 17th century, they were powerful, rich and one of its companies was doing a job called colonizing. So powerful but a small country destroyed by Britain because it was bigger not because of any other merit. They went to war and Netherlands lost and there went too its gold standard and the global reach it had. Let's list the merits of this system: 
* YOU COULD RETRIEVE YOUR GOLD, everyone could, no fractional reserve scam
* It wasn't bubbly(the tulips thing happened but doesn't reflect the state of the economy)
* It didn't had high inflation
* Literally the center of commerce of the world and of Europe
* 150 years of total credibility
Therefore I reach the conclusion that fractional reserve isn't a requirement for a thriving economy as you previously believed but was proved wrong.

You are confusing a bank savings account with a bank investment account. In Ancient Greece for example, most of the banking was restricted to savings accounts, the bank would store the money and you had to pay a fee for it. There's the problem that the banker has the incentive to lend this money, but this is how it was supposed to work there and for most of the history of gold/silver based economies. You could lend the money but this was an entirely different operation. The blockchain is a savings account and what you describe is an investment. The difference becomes more blurry once you can withdraw from the investments account like from a savings account but mind you that these things are different. The merge happens because it makes no sense to hold fiat, so you deposit your money on a "savings" account, which is actually an investment and not a bank in the ancient meaning of the word.
Since Bitcoin is more similar to gold than fiat, you should consider this thing an investment.

When this debt is paid, it surely inflates the money supply, but jobs may have been lost when those savings got pulled out of the economy(less consumption), also many jobs where not created, this creates a sort of strength based on debt, it stills inflates more than it strengths, but Bitcoin hasn't yet reached the point of complete advantage over this. 
Now since the current deficits are being paid, the government will keep having this level of deficits or higher until it can't have more deficits because the private sector handed out all the money and no one is left to be taxed and cover the debt expense.

I do not see any country in the world on the level of US but we're in for surprises with the development of west africa and maybe south america, none of these to the US level though. One thing that surprises me is that even with Trump, US is unable to cut government spending. Tax cuts alone ensures deficits and increasing taxation or inflation in the future, being a big drag for US economy and US does not, currently, has a big narrative for economic liberty. With enough pressure, I'm afraid it will give in to the wrong direction before coming back.

This does not answer the question. If I send you 0.5 satoshis, I'll have a fraction of the lowest unit of the network and you as well. If either of us close this channel, the value has to be rounded down because a miner can't take fractions of a satoshi as mining fee. If it were rounded up, you'b be creating 0.5 satoshis without mining. So, by rounding down, this channel will have a satoshi that is lost forever.

Bitcoin is for individuals, not countries.

Assuming that this deposit is a savings deposit, the bank will offer a positive rate to attract the saver. I don't get what you're trying to imply out of this, simply because there's a fixed amount of coins out there, it doesn't mean that the currency is deflationary. If the economy doesn't grow, prices and wages remain stable.  
Although, you may argue that humans like to improve their well-being, thus, they will seek ways to increase the amount of money they have, leading to more savings which allows more investments, leading to deflation. If the amount of savings is very high, the interest rate will be very low, although still positive, tending to zero.  
If you make your question clearer, maybe I analyse the situation beyond the obvious. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 21:46:55
You can't guarantee that there will be an average deflation of whatever % yearly. This knowledge requires you to know what is being invested on currently everywhere and what return each of these investments will bring to the prices - they may fail.  
Another problem is that, since you assumed a number to the deflation rate, which isn't know previously, you could reach the plausible conclusion that no bank would exist under these circumstances. One thing to consider is that banks would not need to exist in a situation where people only invested out of their savings, this being a possibility since deflation raises your capabilities. Unlikely, but I don't see a problem in banks offering positive rates of return, the only different thing here is that banks are much smaller, seeking profits locally instead of being multinational all-powerful too-big-to-fail companies.

As I see that you did not read a word of my previous comment, or if you read, you didn't try to comprehend, I'll ilustrate for you: big companies can offer big bargains because of economies of scale.

All transactions spend a previous unspent transaction output(UTXO), with the exception of the coinbase transaction, but this one is created by miners. A node verifies the signature and the existence of this UTXO and propagate it if they are valid. 
@_date: 2018-06-19 15:10:27
Once the coins are created, they don't disappear ([unless as fees if a miner doesn't include them in the coinbase, this way they disappear from supply]( The only important piece of data is the UTXO and the sum of coins value in the UTXO set will be roughly equal to the amount of coins created. Each satoshi comes from a previously mined block whose coins could only be spent if the transaction was valid, rendering this recursion through the blockchain useless because validation is done in a per transaction basis.  
How would a non-UTXO be included in the blockchain? If this is possible it must be a miner only feature because all transactions made by the users currently need to include a fee and this fee is provided via a UTXO.

A computer holding funds on behalf of some user in a POS scheme can only participate in the consensus system if there's intenet connection. If a computer is taken down through DDOS, the balance threshold for performing an attack is significantly reduced.  
It does not matter if it is POS or dPOS, it creates points which will affect the consensus system if these computers are taken down.  
Due to the nature of POS, no work is required. A successful attacker can overwrite as many blocks as he whises. This is the reason that, on the long run, social attacks are effective: POW has immutable coins while if the consensus system of a POS scheme is altered, any number of blocks can be changed, there's an incentive from users of some POW scheme to collude with some users of a POS scheme to corrupt the POS consensus and the POS users would be rewarded with immutable, precious, decentralized bitcoins.  
Another flaw is the creation of bubble because of the liquidity destruction.

I doubt it is going to be ever replaced, but I'm more practical than an idealist. It has to endure just enough, it doesn't matter if it doesn't hold 50 years, it already worked. I only care if it does work in the next 6 years, then I might reconsider my investment based on the health of the system. It's a new place carved for liberty, it does not need to endure it all, just enough for my objectives.  
Mining is becoming increasingly a long-term investment, improvements are coming less and less often and all the talk about increasing the block size has cooled down since the fork, pleasing both sides, I believe. It's not an environment for 51% attacks but on not very safe chains, and this increases the risk of a potential attacker: his market share might be lost forever with his hardware if there's a POW change. The unique characteristic of Bitcoin is being the first of its kind and it has not changed since then, this was the sort of business it was involved in. You can create another consensus, but you have to consider if it is really smart to start a new one when there's one established.

A country is not safe because it can sustain the attacks of everyone else without trouble, a country is safe because no one dares to attack it in the first place.

You should be informed enough before throwing a number in the air.  
A miner wouldn't have the majority of the hashrate, at least in public knowledge, which in practice means this would have no effect whatsoever, because this would trigger a POW change that would make all his hardware useless, such is the specialization of Bitcoin mining hardware, thus, yes, more mining equals more security.

There has to be 100&amp; reserve. If depositors suspect that there's a bank working under fractional reserve, they'll withdraw immediately and the bank will be broke. Bitcoin is very similar to gold in this aspect and happened under the gold standard, creating boom and bust cycles. Small banks were whipped out of the market in the burst phase because they couldn't pay back the depositors that make unusually high withdraws in the deflationary recession/crash.  
The convenience and speed of withdraws on\-chain would make this problem appear much sooner than it otherwise would with gold. Look up the Bank of Amsterdam.

Currently, any cryptocurrency is a failure for retail. You won't have merchants accepting a currency that does not please them enough, which will come only as it gains value. Thus, you cannot claim that your currency will help spread others because in the end, only a handful will remain.  
As long as a currency can't be controlled by governments, individuals will build on top of it decreasing the need for further decentralization and privacy as the system will already work on reputations, thus, there's no need for privacy. I don't understand what you're all hiding from, good luck for the government trying to get millions of Bitcon owners.  
Instead, since you're building a market on privacy and trustlessness - or whatever that means for a POS scheme -, you're increasing your risk when you could make connections with people around you. The only use this could have is darknet markets, but I think by now they already solved most of their problems.  
It's an altcoin that doesn't benefit Bitcoin in any way.  I get rid of what has the least of value, so I'd gadly spend this coin but won't spend any bitcoins. The idea is to destroy fiat first, so I won't go through your scheme and I speculate I won't gain momentum since it's purpose is retail, it's no more realistic than the shitcoins you talk about, it's the exactly same thing disguised as something else.

ASIC resistance is bad because if it fails, you still have the buzzword around to claim otherwise. You can't predict what sort of hardware miners are developing.  
POW is the only system that works without drawbacks, since the issuance is fairer and all coins ate available. The dispute boils down to choose weather you want to destroy hardware and some energy or liquidity, which is the fuel of POS. It may not seem bad, but destroying liquidity creates room for massive bubbles meanwhile electricity and hardware are not very liquid. POS issuance is also always wrecked.

I agree about the economy of scale, but you cannot tell how much energy prices vary in the world.

You could, for additional security, memorize two seeds in the case you're forced to say it, you'd give the lower denomination and if you are good enough to lie in this situation, you'd be safe.

The cherry on your nonsense is this widget thing, you had to pick a non scarce item for sale!! If in a city there lives a 1000 happy people minding their business and suddenly 500 guys appear, I mean, that's war for sure! Fuck these invaders, either we or they starve and they won't be living in our nice houses.  
Now if 1000 people, 500 couples, give birth to 500 children, if the currency is scarce, what will happen is that as they enter labor age, prices will decrease and wages in general too, but an increased quantity of items can be made and maybe a new technology was developed and there would be more people competing for the yields. This means that a higher population has more wealth, not surprising. In our closed city, how the prices of eggs doubling would increases anyone's standard of living? The standard of living depends on production and production is affected by bubbles when the currency inflates and leads to bad investments, the standard of living has nothing to do with the deflation. The currency could inflate 10% per day or deflate 3% per day REGULARLY, as long as the adjustments were made to prices via indexation, nothing would be harmed and it wouldn't be as good as a currency that doesn't change its supply because of the inconvenience of adjusting the prices.  
What I meant by regularly is that a body of corrupt politicians and a bankers lobby cannot create new money supply via fractional reserve and see what happens to prices, it's obvious that the first to take the money will benefit and we can't predict how the money will flow and where prices are going to increase first. This is inflation uncertainty, a problem only solved by cryptocurrencies.

Spending BTC decreases its value and adds useless blockchain spam.Spending cannot grow an economy, growth is caused by good investments and these require savings, BTC is the savings part. Savings -&gt; investments -&gt; possible growth if good investments were made. Notice that an investment is something that gives back yield so you can have the same you had before **plus profits**(in capital, not necessarily money). Spending recklessly won't give growth and there's too much fiat money printed that it can probably deal with it while is it still so overvalued against BTC, thus there's little reason to spend BTC.
It is useless to spend BTC in expectation that the economy will grow. The first half of the phrase is wrong, spending won't give growth all the times(like [this time]( The second half is also wrong because more BTC being spent means less savings and the possibilities of investments are lower.
At most, what you get by spending BTC is to pay many fees through your way, becoming a target now that the people who took the money may be able to explore the blockchain and see how much you got, spamming the blockchain needlessly, all of that only to at the end undo your BTC purchase, resulting in exactly zero in new savings, but negative for you because you could be smarter and dump fiat instead.

If you abandon the transaction, it won't go through unless a miner picks it before your order.

No, it's truth. Older nodes view segwit transactions as [anyone can spend]( It's a know fact that users have little incentive to run their own nodes regardless of how much they own in Bitcoin. Since segwit transactions rely upon the majority of nodes viewing these transactions as segwit and not anything else, this type of Bitcoin user should be the ones running more nodes, enforcing the rules by overwhelming majority preventing miners from taking all their funds. This is the price of segwit and I think it's not being properly tagged.

Wait for synchronization, it may appear. If you can get the transaction id (txid), you can search in a block explorer to see if it went through and also check the fee. If the fee is too low, you have probably made a replace-by-fee transaction with this wallet, thus, you could increase it.

People will react very negatively because now they have to honor their word and pay debts as soon as possible. However, the rewards of this improved system would kick in soon. 
I don't know what you mean by mobility, housing bubbles of today increase the price of it massively, people had an easier time moving before because costs weren't so high, it is just the information that you are seeing travelling, not actual people(unless you're talking about moving to a poorer area). If they had too much trouble moving, they would die much more than they did.
I don't know how societies will be, they could be only in the form of cities states, empires and US is always the odd example of having nothing to do with anything else. Countries usually crumble after adopting democracy(in many ways, by debt, by foreign invasion, by low fertility, the many small thefts imposed by democracies that may add to half the GDP and impoverish the remainder of the population, these problems were smaller in at the times of the Western Kingdoms) but US is still holding the bone somehow, but the grip is now looser than it was.

To maintain current hashrate entirely on fees, fees would be about 20 dollars. Fees decrease the time preference of users =&gt; less spam, lower velocity and higher prices and also fees would increase in terms of dollars and decrease in terms of BTC(long term). Once it is more seriously established, average user would move once every few months. This scheme is diabolical from a saver perspective, so they consider it worth it and continue to use it. I consider it *perfect*. This is the cost of the security the market sets on it, if you find it too high, take it as a moment to remember to save more and spend less and most important, to not pollute the blockchain with your spam.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:08:37
You still have to pay fees, the difference is that Bitcoin got a real load of them. This block is a marketing trial that wouldn't happen without intent and does not represent the transaction capacity of BCH. The scaling problem won't go away, you only got bad cards to play with the miners because they created BCH. I love how you think a bigger block is a magical solution to everything. If you need to transfer money cross borders routinelly, it'd be better to use something built for it, like Litecoin or wait a little until a real conclusion about the technologies to scale Bitcoin really are out there showing what they can or cannot do.

I like gold and understand that that's a radical change. Most survivalist believe gold could be a currency when colapse happens, but I don't think this could happen or that I would have any chance of survival more with a gold coin - quite the contrary.  
Simply from a inflationary view, there are 165k metric tons of gold and the yearly mined gold is about 2500 metric tons, to pick a fair number. This results in a yearly inflation of 1.5%. The problem is that Bitcoin's inflation is 4% roughly now, halvened each 4 years and will eventually reach 0 plus Bitcoin users have less incentive to spend than gold users since there will be always a fee to get out(that's why I like gold though). [Gold info link](  [Gold production info](

Sorry, I was lazy in my answer.

There are very little efficient ways of storing massive amounts of energy. It is therefore hard to "hold" it and then bring it to the market and sell it. Chemical energy in batteries cannot be re-uploaded to the alternate current electrical grid, if it could, would it be in the same frequency? Frequency inverters are expensive too. Gasoline is much better for this purpose. Electrical energy is easier to distribute according to the demand, spending almost all of it, than to store and the real storage methods don't store electrical energy, it converts it to potential energy pumping it up a higher dam for example.

Monero ring size is usually 8 but there's not upper limit. Wasabi is using anonymity sets up until 100(today, but it also has no upper limit). By this comparison, the only difference would be that BTC transactions are much smaller than Monero transactions of the same anonymity set. However, Wasabi makes equal outputs and gives back unequal changes, in Monero transactions' values are obscured.
Wasabi works through tor, so it is anonymous in this regard too, while Monero optionally works through tor.

No, nothing just wait. Although it is possible to build another transaction that uses the same outputs and broadcast it, doble spending it on you, it is unlikely that it will be done now. This later transaction wouldn't be broadcast to the network since nodes would reject it. It is possible nevertheless, but only if delivered directly to miners. There's nothing suspicious, if you want to be safe, wait for a confirmation or ask for a higher fee.

Capital flight as bubbles becomes unsustainable and government seizes available savings. Look at Argentina: they are very indebted and the only "solution" they find is to print more money, the same happened with Venezuela. Many indebted countries are vulnerable to this, not Argentina particularly because they are used to this sort of misbehavior by their local landlord, but in a place where they couldn't recall it like Venezuela (like in Brazil, the next on the list. Paraguay and Uruguay are dependent upon Brazil and Argentina, still safer but will go down regardless), the situation rapidly becomes catastrophic.
Yet, this is only South America, the real deal will be Chinese capital flight.

Instead of making this claim, you can show me where my ignorance lies. Open source software, as per MIT license applied to Bitcoin, states that there are use, modification, distribution and private use liberties for this software. Can you show me how such software can be owned?
The Bitcoin network works by blocks being accept or denied by the reference implementation, be it a Satoshi one or one of the newer versions, guaranteeing that there are no significant consensus changes, AKA hard-forks. I don't know how you could change a system built by God knows who when such being created it with the purpose of it being a immutable book beyond the reach of governments. Governance is needed to change it and this by definition is centralization. I'll be pleased to know where my ignorance lies in this and I'm eager to be enlightened.

This happened because they didn't not have the needed hashrate, so there was a rule that after some hours without blocks difficulty would fall, so they waited and let the difficult fall then began mining lots of blocks with little delay between then. There was a hoax that some miners switched chains to prevent difficulty from falling, but I think they were just after the money of non-stop blocks. During the Bcash fork, the Bitcoin network slowed down due to this chain switching and that's how they are 6k blocks ahead. Not sure if this is beneficial, their block reward is going to drop sooner and they have no fee market to amenize this impact and no one uses it.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:52:41
Two were unintentional and the intentional one was a change that didn't affect the previous rules so it can be considered a soft fork. The hard fork with the inflation bug was solved in a soft fork in which the chain that lagged behind eventually grew faster than the chain that mined billions of bitcoin in existence. You see that it IS a hard fork but the network switched the chain and thus is was a soft fork, just like orphan blocks are a minor version of a soft fork.

You inserted 2^8 more than bitcoin's blockchain as the number of transactions BCH can hold. That's 256 times, it would only be achievable if blocks in Bitcoin cash were 256 times bigger than in Bitcoin, but the maximum now is 8MB as "soft" limit and 32MB as maximum. They chose to "scale" linearly. If it grows, normal users won't be able to run their own nodes, effectively centralizing the power since nodes are needed to validate blocks. Normal users already have problems running normal Bitcoin nodes, but in BCH, it can become impossible.

* All transactions are spam and mess with the deflationary order. That's why you have to pay to spam.
* Bigger blocks give advantage to the miner that mined them because they take more time to propagate, the miner who mined them will have an advantage of a few seconds is already too much. Since bigger mining pools mine blocks more often, they will receive more rewards due because they will start mining the next block sooner than the rest. [Empirically](

I already said that that repo is restricted by the client software history, that it didn't pop out of nothing, and thus is cannot make relevant changes, AKA hard-forks. I don't understand why you keep saying that Github controls Bitcoin, if all the devs die, if Github begins to host child pornography, and if Microsoft decides to roll out the evil devil software of world domination, none of that will have any impact on Bitcoin because there's always an earlier client to move to up to Satoshi's code! While the clients are not the same, the rules stays and there is no Pope or US president or socialist able to change any of them. The code has to be developed somewhere so by your logic all code is compromised because a centralized programmer hosts it in his computer or in any other hosting service on the cloud. All the time you push for a different version with "decentralized devs", I can only think of huge porn scene.

If the difference is a small cost that the hobbyist cannot handle, this is no difference from this hobbyist perspective because solo mining he will lose much more than that before he mines a block. You are implying that to participate in Bitcoin you need to connect with a centralized network. This network intended to reduce mining delays exists, but isn't required to mine. If it was a requirement, Bitcoin would be broken entirely. As blocks get bigger, as show in that post, worse these delays are, worsening the situation for smaller pools, hobbyists or not since bigger pools can hold blocks before releasing them to ensure some seconds of advantage.

If you only consider the way it works now, then yes, because the shuffling Wasabi does is an operation different from transacting. Like Monero, every Bitcoin transaction can be a mixing transaction if some users join, and if it was working this way, the main difference between the two would be that Monero hides transactions' amounts, also a single Monero transaction is a lot more inefficient than one Bitcoin transaction because a mixing Monero transaction serves only one user(you can argue that it benefits the whole network, but it is just one user per transaction) while a single Bitcoin transaction *would* serve many. It's unfair to say that Monero doesn't hold any merit because this is not yet happening in BTC.

Ecuador is a country in which the US dollar has replaced the local currency and the same happened in Somalia. Currently, Venezuelan people are using a basket of currencies because they can't carry value with the Bolivar, among these, Bitcoin is used because they have a shortage of dollars there, a shortage of all money notes actually, so it is used to not overpay in a dollar or peso. In a quick research you can find that the dollar replaced the hyper-inflating currency of Zimbabwe too and today Argentina is also facing inflation problems, were do you think the rich would park their money? Another way to look at this is the disproportionate share of trade that is carried out using the Swiss franc, the currency that only removed the gold peg in the 1990s and never had high inflation.  
Therefore, it is true that over a certain level of inflation, people will seek for alternative currencies. Applying a thought you use often in calculus, over a long enough span of time, the most sound money will win.

Fee crisis? I saw noobs in panic making miners rich. I was planning to hold through the whole thing but I had to make a transaction. It paid off so, I don't care if it was expensive(over 700 sat/byte, I'm impatient, I wanted the first block to catch it up), that's how priority works.  
Selling on bad news is exactly the type of mindset that cause the fees to rise to that level.

If gold coins aren't kept to their purity, people will hoard those that are purer. Yes, the argument is simply because people have to buy food because a) no one is retarded to die instead of spending a tiny amount of gold b) because there's an incentive. This incentive leads to refrain when spending, which means, generally speaking, people buy less crap.  
It's funny when you mention a "political dislike of inflation", as if a man couldn't have the right to keep the fruits of his labor for himself and not in the debased currency of a tyrant - no, 2% a year isn't acceptable, that's why there's an immutable ledger in the first place.  
According to Gresham's Law, this will happen until the weakest currency is dead.  
There's absolutely no modern knowledge about deflation out in the wild. At the time gold was the currency, the economy worked fine on a global scale. Locally however, deflation poses a threat to the centralization of political power. As population grows, this problem increases. It's a problem for the governments. It seems you can only keep the cat in the bag for so long and thence, it happens inevitably. There's no word I or you can say about it, because it's not a process god has any word on.

No it doesn't. 51% attack means that the attacker paid someone and then is capable of mining a longer chain of blocks to invalidate that transaction, keeping the money and the thing he bought. This attacker can't mine more coins than the current limit and can't spend others funds.

You can sign a transaction offline and keep your keys totally secured, you rely only on the entropy quality.  
Back to the deflation discussion. It's is inevitable since one can copy and paste the code, adjust the monetary expansion and run it. A coin that stops producing more units of itself prevails over another with infinite supply because you only trade your currency for another that tends to keep its value or increases in value. You can cry as much as you want, "that doesn't work", but the world relied on gold and it was all fine.

Hello suninabox,  
I seek for the truth and I won't take any of this to a personal level, any insinuation in that way should be kindly interpreted as rhetoric. 
According to the Austrian business cycle theory, crisis are created when central banks, who control the money supply, lower the interest rates, which in their view is the fuel to economy growth. The problem is that interest rates weren't so low normally, because of the lack of savings, the decrease is a manipulation. What this brings up is borrowing, now that money is cheaper. This money is given in investments that wouldn't be made with the normal rates, but are being made because of the lower interest rates.  
Eventually, the borrowed money increases the supply so much that inflation plagues the whole population. CB react to  inflation by raising the interest rates until it is under a certain threshold. Business that rely on cheap money met their end and the crisis follow. What could be done to solve the crisis? Either you let it break down and rates are determined by the saving rate or, what CB usually do, lower interest rates until business receives enough to keep running. Inflation here is regarded as bad by the Austrian School because it comes from artificially lowered interest rates.  
This explanation is simple enough to explain how CB make crisis worse and how complex magic formulas don't apply in the economy to boost growth. Having a fixed interest rate that changes according to changes in the economy, growth or depression, seems to be pretense of knowledge in matters that are beyond the acceptable interference of this institution.  
With that stated, I now counterattack the "deflation is inherently evil" argument.
According to [this empirical study]( besides the Great Depression, there's no link of depression and deflation as corelated. Instead:


	
Thus, the accusation that deflation causes recession or make the economy shrink is completely false along with deflationary spiral CIA theory.
Secondly, the Wikipedia article, which shouldn't be used as reference for anything, but since you used it fisrt:
	


I do not endorse any irresponsible borrowing. You may know how it used to be when citizens couldn't pay their debts: they became their creditors' slaves. The common statement that the US government shouldn't care about its debt is utter mediocrity: a government engaging in an activity that was only proper to slaves! It may tell you the state of things currently. It will eventually be paid, there's nowhere to run, and guess who will pay it?  
Back the the theory, inflation as a policy and collateral effect of rates manipulation, borrows resources from the present and cause inflation latter in the cycle, when economy pays for the irresponsibility. It is perfectly aligned with every short-sighted policy typical of democracies: do what you can while your government lasts.  
But don't worry, this doesn't mean that the world as we know would be different with deflation. It'd be better. If prices generally fall by 2%, this means that the economic output is 2% greater, considering the same monetary supply. This means that as prices falls, wages falls too, although not exactly in proportion, the most necessary individuals would see their wages flat for most periods.  
There's no evidence that lower prices create expectation of further decreases. I could wait 5 years to buy the last phone today. It'd be cheaper, but this doesn't really happens. Bitcoin went from 19 thousand to 6 and a half thousand dollars. Will investors sell until there's no more expectation of any sell order being triggered? This would necessarily mean that, on the long run, they want it for free. No, after being hammered, investors - and consumers, why not? - expect it to go up, because it's at a discount.  
The explanation for why have all countries abandoned the gold standard is because the US had too much gold after WWII. It would be terrible for other countries. This coupled with Keynesianism creates the perfect bacterial culture for the proliferation of fiat.  
Your "argument" that people can't buy food with money is flawed. The sign says "we will take anything", that includes money too, if people have some. The fact the few are using money is because they don't really want to spend it, it'd be better to pay with something else. Note the deflation here was not concomitant with bankruptcy, the business owner simply accepts a lower denomination of value and keeps working.  
Maybe the problems of deflation is that winners are the savers? As it always was in the gold standard? What problem you got with that?

A currency that is more divisible can still be used in times of high deflation, like Bitcoin. Prices simply get lower. I'm not in favor of bather, what I said it that it is impressive that business kept working despite the limitation in the divisibility of the currency.

That's the communication failure we're having. You are going to store your bitcoins in trezor or in electrum. But the device itself does not matter, you can restore your funds in either because of their compatibility.  
The Glacier Protocol suggests that you store in multisig addresses, but normal addresses are actually safer, thus, you can read it and learn how to perform this process offline, ignoring the multisig generation part.  
If you plan to store in Trezor, you don't need to do anything in Glacier Protocol. Trezor, in this case, is your wallet.  
As you admittedly said you're a noob, use Trezor. It is dangerous to set up any of this alone and the blockchain is irreversible, any mistake will be forever.

Now that's a real strawman. The word used is "corrupt", which implies both organizations are corrupt. Since Bitcoin is not an organization, neither in the government sense nor in the business meaning, it cannot be corrupt because the rules it validates are its own. To say that this is somehow an ideological bias against inflation is just too much of a speculation.  
Tether states that all of its tokens are backed by dollars, unverifiable but not immediately corrupt. If QE is corruption I let you decide, but if promising to reduce the balance sheet and then acting in with exact opposite purpose is not corruption, then I don't know what it is. Let them buy the whole planet, it's just an "ideological bias" after all, fuck logic!

No, it doesn't. Replay means there's someone who sees your transaction in BTC1 and broadcasts it in BTC2.  
You can get around it using the difference in blocktime to split your coins. You can do this in any of the chains, but I'll assume BTC2 is the slowest. All addresses are yours.  
*Sign two transactions that spend all funds of an address. Make sure to make them replaceable by fee! One must have a higher fee than the other (make the difference in fee noticeable, as if you're trying to please a miner).  
*Broadcast the tx with the lowest fee in BTC1 (fastest chain). Once confirmed in this chain, BTC1, spend the funds again to another address. Now, if everything went as planned, you have your funds in different addresses in BTC1 and BTC2.  
*Broadcast the tx with the highest fee in BTC2. If there's someone broadcasting your tx in this chain, this tx will be replaced by the one you just sent. It will be confirmed first, thus, your coins are successfully split.  
I don't recommend anyone do to this, but that's how you do it.

Orphaned blocks is a fairly rare event, thanks to the 10 minutes blocktime, that doesn't affect the system in the current distribution of hash power, because the natural fork solution comes without problems.  
In this attack, anyone who collude with the miner can double spend the transaction. Addresses aren't really anonymous, chain analysis makes easier to determine who possibly could be colluding with the miner of if it is the miner himself. 51% of the hashrate is something that would trigger short orders in Bitcoin, those with computational resources that know how to recover order can use their hash power to rebalance and long on the stability of the system, thus, 51% attack seems a very ephemeral opportunity. As you pointed out, that doesn't mean the perpetrator isn't know, as even now orphaned blocks are stored.  


Bitcoin would be useful again as soon as no one has 51% of hash power, afterwards, why wouldn't transactions be safe?  
You imply that it is in the miner interest, even holding very illiquid assets, such as asics, that the network fails in double-spend attacks. The amount of money to do it is enormous, the length of the attack is ephemeral and its rewards are not secured. Do you think the kind of people against whom this attack could be performed profitably can't understand that the system would be in a unstable phase? This also never happened, but how long will our discussion about your paranoia continue? There are problems more current than that one, selfish mining for example, that worries me more.

You can rebroadcast your tx with a higher fee if you really want to get it through fast. You could also wait a good time and pay a low fee, you can get one transaction in the blockchain for as low as 2 satoshi per byte, if you time it wisely.

The market is the ultimate judge in the matter of where should energy be. Since we're humans, we will eat before we mine and the world goes round the same way it did before.

You got a pretty good example - electricity. Since everyone is investing in Bitcoin instead of eletricity, electricity will become more expensive, bitcoin mining will too. Miners see the problem and whoever offers them the solution will get paid. But this is when the return in electricity is higher than that of Bitcoin, because they wouldn't be investing money in that if it wasn't absolutely necessary to the continuity of their business.  


Makes sense, miners, as consumers, will wait to be backrupt before calling for help to deal with the price of electricity.  
It's good that purchases be delayed, the economy will focus on what matters, unuseful spending will be punished. Accept, it's not like the world never used gold. This sobriety in spending is an incentive to make high value produts without expiration date. Isn't this a good thing?

This may be a wrong approach to analyze batching. Consider the case of one block containing only 5 transactions of an exchange, without batching and only one output. The second case is one block with one batching transactions from the exchange and one output transactions that now occupy the freed space. The number of outputs per transaction in this case isn't increasing tremendously since the free space may be occupied with smaller transactions.

They are the only meaningful changes, any hard fork would signal that the system Satoshi created was being destroyed, but in favor of what?  
You can add rules and these rules are valid for as long as you make your presence relevant in the form of only accepting, for example, segwit transactions with the signature. As long as most of the nodes are of this type, you expect that no miner tries to corrupt the added rules, corruption which would be accepted by previous versions of the software. This change requires that the users put some pressure on miners. If this was not possible because, for example, an state attack capable of turning off most nodes, the added rules would yield nothing.  
Your point is that it would be needed 133 MB blocks to make LN work for everyone, and I replied with a saner alternative than trying to change Bitcoin. How would this change not be a hard fork? Tomorrow each bit will be worth 133 of today's bits? Are you promoting any meaningful change at all or I misinterpreted?

If you know how to use linux, use a common distro on a offline computer to generate your transactions. Depending on your effort, you'll have a scheme that is safer than a hardware wallet. It is important that the system is clear and that you do not connect it to the internet again, wifi not allowed! Make sure to install something to fetch QR codes from it or another thing to transfer the transaction files. It is worth it to generate the transaction safely and only signing it there since you won't use it for anything else for a while. It may be cheaper than 100 dollars but will take some time to setup.

Bitcoin is sold on the premise it is a currency, not stock. You only trade a currency for another you think it's better, like bolivars for Swiss franks, thus, users of Bitcoin believe in it as a better currency, not as a mean, like stocks, to get more fiat currency. It the inverse was true, Bitcoin would be seen and sold as a regular stock.  


The fact that none of that matters shows that the store of value market is in far more need than any of these. You could achieve anonymity within Bitcoin if you're smart enough. But free transactions in decentralized system is a unreachable dream and Bitcoin is decentralized, different story than Ethereum whose owners can roll-back the "blockchain". I think you are new here to make such confusion.

Sorry, I was answering about multisig alone, I did not noticed your purpose.  
I don't get what you mean by the wallet you use to transfer to your Trezor. If you want to store and not touch it, you would transfer directly to your cold storage wallet unless you wanna mix before, it's not clear your intent. 
Then, how the cold storage wallet is set up is the next issue. You could trust Trezor or build your own. To build your own to store a high amount, you need, ideally, two air-gapped computers to store the keys an sign your transactions off-line, thus, you could verify their content before broadcasting them. Read the Glacier Protocol, but don't use the multisig scheme, use normal addresses generated offline.  
If you want more security, you need to generate you own entropy to get your addresses.  
It's easier to trust Trezor, but you can't verify the whole methodology being used.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:31:15
Yes, back up your trezor seed, make two copies and store them somewhere safe. To recover them in Electrum, you need to specify that it's a BIP 39 seed, in case you ever need this info(I think I lied about the compatibility part, you can recover Trezor seeds in Electrum, but I don't know if it works in the other direction. Electrum won't create BIP 39 seeds, but is able to work with them. Details). After that send your funds to your Trezor wallet.  
It seems pretty safe and a lot of people use it, it has its own entropy generator and won't give away your private keys. That's good enough to protect you from the most common attack, virus infections.

You stated the case where the ROI for Bitcoin was higher than that of electricity. Every investment has a diminishing ROI as the technology improves and competition increases. The ROI for Bitcoin cannot continue to be higher than everything else. The tipping point in this case was when electricity receives no investment and it ends up having a higher ROI than Bitcoin(individuals in the market try to predict the future, this wouldn't happen so automatically as I'm writing).  
This would mean that there are savings in excess, the winning strategy is not the same at all times, thus, it's better to invest than let the money parked in the blockchain. It's all very different from what we have now, surely.  
If electricity becomes more expensive, there's incentive to invest in it, if the price of electricity is ruining your mining operations, in such a way that you're going to be bankrupt soon, then you(or someone) will invest in it surely. It would not make sense for any Bitcoin user to hold a currency that cannot be withdraw because there's no mining operations (yes, we're back to your previous case).

What you wrote implies that a better currency has to be useful for the most trivial things, like retail, rather than the most important, like store of value.

Investors only care about stocks, real state and such things that store value or increase it, thus for these, Bitcoin will be a better currency and this is exactly the public that matters - the public who want to park billions of dollars worth into something and they can rarely move this amount of money without impacting markets hugely.  
I don't know why you use the words "general" or "average" to differentiate yourself from fiat "investors", you clearly didn't get it. Bitcoin is not a proper payment method currently, I don't know where you took this from, but credit cards are way more used than Bitcoin.

You don't need any update to follow the blockchain and use Bitcoin. Ultimately, Bitcoin can only be trustless if you don't accept updates, because they're harmful, or only accept updates from people you trust. Any group is able to add in their way to make things and their different clients would react differently to the content they read. In the great scheme though, they all would be abiding to the rules first created. This configuration makes the things you mentioned mere opinions. The appropriate way to input raw data in the blockchain is encoding addresses, like some devs advise against, or to use OP_RETURN? Opinions, you see? They suck.  
Since opinions are not meaningful and we can argue like adults about facts, has there ever been any meaningful change to Bitcoin? The refusal to answer this question tells me there's some hope in you of doing it anyway. How's this not an opinion? You show the relativism you accuse me of more clearly than I do, because I only care about facts.  
The way I defined meaningful touches the center of the question: is Bitcoin truly trustless? The same way you could touch the center of the abortion controversy by admitting that a zygote is a human being, not some arbitrary line draw in sand.

This is not an opinion, gotta make up some definitions to work with. Meaningful change is a term intended to honor Bitcoin's 9 years long survival, not to mean the higher transactions capacity isn't great. It means that the base rules survived, more were added and it still works.

You confuse some things, only because I said billions of dollars worth, it does not means fiat, it could be a investors bonds holdings, a ton of gold, a big building you want to sell, the most boring company of South Korea, something  a big investor would find security investing in. This is the main market of Bitcoin.  
Currencies market cap price all the things that are available to be bought with said currency. If a currency is worth more, by being a store of value, then more things are available to be bought and it succeeds.  
If this currency is worth more, people save it. If they refrain from spending it and are not monks, then they'll have government currency to live with: they will spend that which has the least value until everyone dumps it and Bitcoin becomes the most liquid currency. Replacing fiat currency and gold as  stores of value requires this currency not to be in circulation and the naive would say it has failed when the only failure was his of not understanding that demand for it is too big so there's little in circulation and there won't be retail with Bitcoin while fiat exists conveniently to be dumped.  
Those who can dump fiat the most are the wealthy that's why store of value is the main market, they have so much fiat to dump they couldn't care less. Thus Bitcoin is not and won't be in the immediate future a decent payment method.

Miners don't have a say on that either, because the rules they follow are already set, they follow or they spend energy in vain with invalid blocks. Nodes wouldn't accept it, fees would rise and they would eventually come back. The assumption is strong with Bitcoin: even with 51% of the hashrate, you still don't set the rules and the it would probably be worth a POW change, which would make them entirely bankrupt. There's also a thing called merge-mining. Bitcoin blockchain can survive these attacks.

If no one holds, mining profitability, i.e., security, will go down. By increasing mining profitability, the holders are increasing the security of their own wealth. No holdling would actually destroy Bitcoin. Of course, it is preferable that Bitcoin increases its security level over time, thus, holding is the promoted behaviour with the monetary policy.

Gresham's law is specifically dealing with the same currency, as seen by the government, whose intrinsic value is different, a dollar of gold and a paper dollar, for example.

That doesn't work. Fiat works with the rich owing most of the stock market which grows with the companies as the currency loses value. This means that the largest companies will be owned by the rich and when you spend, most likely this money is going back up to the elite. If Bitcoin is decentralized, its users mustn't have a incentive to spend, effectively decentralizing wealth and bankrupting a vice economy.

Bitcoin's inflation will be lower than 2% by 2020, only 2 years ahead. Since financial analysts measure the increase in price and not in the money supply, like in Bitcoin, we're talking about a greater difference than these measly 2%, if they do not adapt.

CZ, you spent 20 BTC, but I'm 375 BTC ahead of you(30 blocks each with 12.5 BTC of newly minted coins!!1!), plus the fees in all these blocks that I didn't bother to add up. No miner is going to mine for your 20 BTC if they already mined most of the last 30 blocks and thus would see their funds lost in a fork. It'd be trading the security of the already gained for the insecurity of a briber against a competent hacker.

This is not what you are thinking. 7000 BTC were stolen, the daily blocks reward now is 1800 BTC plus all block fees, so he would create a series of transactions in which miners earn more than they have mined until now and thus he funds with his own money an alternative chain. Supposing the cost is 2000 BTC, it would leave 5000 BTC back to him, the loss would be less than what he has lost now. This is not an issue of mining centralization, the network just makes it possible although it is expensive.

30 blocks * 12.5 reward per block = 375 BTC (not counting the fees). Victim can offer everything, but wants to keep some, he has to spend something to convince miners to switch. In the honest chain(the blockchain shall not the rolled back to reverse transactions), the attacker can spend everything too, but has a 375 BTC advantage. If the victim spends everything, the attacker will only need to spend 7000 - 375 = 6625 BTC, keeping 375 BTC. The attacker may also bribe up to the maximum amount because he's better off with something than with nothing.
However, in all these 30 blocks already earned fees turns the odds further in favor of the hacker. 30 blocks is already too much, it would be more reasonable to try to do something if the transaction was not confirmed.

A currency usually has the following atributes: store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account. Currently, one may argue that BTC only has store of value function with mixed results, yet overall it always held some value(there was a cost of mining them, thus the first miners perceived BTC to be as valuable as their time and electricity at least). This is also the sequence followed when a currency takes the place of another, like the dollar in countries with high inflation(first as store of value, then MoE, then UoA, like the dollar in Russia).
Does BTC  add to the global economy? A better currency that adds the store of value to anyone without ID, KYC, regulations, etc, it definitively adds to the economy. 
Being so, speculators will try to find its proper value. Thus greed drive BTC price, but is that greed justified? Yes because if it was worthless, I bet you wouldn't notice it and it wouldn't be useful at all, not even as a disturbed store of value! Naturally people will switch just like the speculators, although with diminishing returns over time.

Buy a computer, install Debian or your preferred Linux distro (never Tails or something too out there!!), install Electrum, get a paper of good quality(alcaline A4, it is cheap but this might not be clear) and write the seed on it with a pencil, right in the middle then fold the paper and store it somewhere safe(this paper can last of hundreds of years!). For optimum safety, destroy the hard disk of the computer(you will need a new one to spend your coins, but maybe you could use a Linux system running on a pen drive) and make at least an additional copy of the paper. Try implementing a scheme to sign transactions offline and test spending before sending everything there, never connect this computer to the internet, to spend the coins, scan a QR code of the transaction. All of this can be done with Electrum.
