Is this one of the things the DASH dev team helped with?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:24:45
uphold has treated me well so far
@_date: 2018-01-02 17:13:45
I agree with most of this, but some alts are very well funded. For example, have you seen the dev teams for larger alts like eth or dash? We are talking high quality, full-time, high paid devs. Lets not dismiss the competition.

I have had great luck with uphold. Their daily limits are pretty low though, but probably wont impact most people.

Correct me if I'm wrong (I have very limited understanding of XMR) but doesnt monero mix inputs with other users by default and thats where the anonymity comes from? If thats the case, wouldnt that make every monero user affected by this? (as every monero user is providing a mixing service by default) I could see a lot of privacy-centric coins impacted by this, even though I seriously doubt this would pass anyway.

Who else knew that you used to mine bitcoin? Also, you probably didn't run your wallet off of a USB drive, so where is your old computer hard drive from that timeframe?

You're being downvoted because people here hate altcoin advertising. Outside of that, I agree an additional layer in the protocol like "masternodes" could provide a solution in a decentralized manner. 
Because you named the coin, not just the idea, you get downvoted. Just the way it is.
@_date: 2018-08-31 21:54:32
Yes, Monero is pumping because of some investment group research paper that says XMR, DASH, and BTC are like the only top coins going to moon over the next few years. 
@_date: 2018-08-01 16:55:24
It does, its opportunity for real world use. Better hurry before the altcoins make too much progress. example:

This is actually an ad for (scam)quickmining.io(scam) disguised as begging for money. Otherwise there would be no reason to specifically mention the site address, nor the supposedly 10x returns it offers quickly.
The even bigger skeptic in me even thinks that OP might be part of the scam website and using this post as a way to get exposure... not sure on that one but very suspicious. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:12:27
This is a pretty big deal. Is this easily fixable for the darkwallet team?
@_date: 2016-03-16 13:29:25
More likely you were just flooding your own internet connection.
@_date: 2016-03-17 17:06:20
The sarcasm was painfully obvious.

Calling it now. Mike Tyson is Satoshi.
@_date: 2016-01-30 02:51:54
If that's the case, now that blocks are pretty much completely full, is flooding the mempool with 0-fee transactions a potential attack vector? 
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:15:07
LOL that's a new one to me. supports Core because they want bitcoin to be second class to altcoins. What a strange time we live in.
@_date: 2017-01-27 00:58:20
As of now, yes. Just look at alt coins who do this. Cryptonote based altcoins with almost no use whatsoever have super bloated blockchains that are only going to get worse with time. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 15:12:03
You mean Nov '17 right?
@_date: 2016-02-01 21:27:17
Exactly. Look at what altcoins are doing to fix this problem. Dash has like less than 1% of the marketcap of Bitcoin yet has just as many full nodes, a vast majority of them running on real server hardware/connections. 
Incentivised nodes are the only way to fix this problem. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 13:57:52
He was talking about percent inflation, not a number of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:23:44
In the top-tier cryptos (by marketcap) Dash is the only one in direct competition with Bitcoin's use case as digital cash (outside of BCH of course). Because of that, you wont find much love for it on this subreddit. However, if you are wanting to diversify it's probably not a bad choice. The whole incentivized nodes/budget/governance system thing it has going on is pretty cool and would solve most of the ongoing Bitcoin debates.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:26:08
Gotcha. I edited my post :)
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:51:35
How does approx 200 million a day in volume qualify? You have so much DASH that you cant offload with that much volume? If so, please adopt me.
Edit: my bad, i misunderstood what you were saying
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:22:00
I do, and and a bunch of others. One of the only coins with a working on-chain scaling plan and instant transactions. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:43:39
It has Dash, so transactions confirm in less than a second (using instant send)

Couldn't find GBTC on fidelity's site search(not a member), but going to this URL seems to work:
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:48:19
Anyone know if this includes all Bitpanda supported coins (Dash, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin) ?
Edit: Looks like it does: 
@_date: 2015-02-04 18:30:32
Also the same guy who did a security review of Darkcoin's early implementation of anon transactions.
