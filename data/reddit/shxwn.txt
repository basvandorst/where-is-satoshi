As a newbie to both trading and graphing, could someone guide me into making sense and bringing context to the weird sudden [plateau in BTC's chart](
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:31:55
I'm using Electrum and I have about 784 bytes from 5 inputs for my transaction!
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:25:24
where did you buy from that requires 8 days of delivery? and also, if you already have the transaction id, that means the amount of BTC you purchased is fixed already, it's value can (and probably will) still fluctuate while it is in transit.

If I bought alts with my BTC, I feel like im getting screwed since the alt-btc price drops
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:31:47
Hmm, the $100 you spent will still be the same, but your $100 worth (or $96 after fees or something) of BTC might rise/fall in value. That is if you can confirm CoinBase already sent out the transaction

I have about 0.0331 BTC, I'm thinking about shifting all of that onto gdax and trading btc-eth or btc-ltc. (BTC-USD isn't available on gdax for my location). Any thoughts/tips/opinions on this?

Good question, I'm approaching a point where I'm wondering if a HW wallet is what I need.
@_date: 2017-12-13 13:06:15
How about Limit and Stop orders?
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:56:33
This was my exact thoughts like an hour ago! Would love to know too!

Coinbase and GDAX are linked, you can put USD onto your Coinbase account, then transfer this USD over to GDAX, then buy on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:58:51
If i sell or buy on gdax using the ["Market" tab]( will I be hit with fees? I would like to do some BTC to LTC/ETH trades and would like to find out
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:52:32
Are there alternatives to GDAX for trading with low fees that allow fiat-crypto exchanges? As much as I would LOVE to use CoinBase and GDAX, GDAX currently doesnt support fiat-crypto in my country.
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:59:33
my fees are about 3x more for this particular tx because of the number of smaller parts to it. but the fees atm are higher because of the huge volume going through

Hey, what are your thoughts on the Exodus wallet? I tried it for like 30 mins and uninstalled it. I found Exodus to have outrageous fees.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:55:21
Why didnt I think of this!!
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:32:08
took that risk to get advice
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:12:17
that is insane

Goodluck, and to the moon!

I've registed with gemini, still trying to get verified there. Are there more detailed charts/charting tools for gemini apart from what's seen on the dashboard?

Funny cause this is exactly what I am doing too. Paper in 8 hours.

How about Limit and Stop orders?
@_date: 2017-12-04 14:55:03
No fees from moving from coinbase to GDAX. Not too sure on the move back. Credentials are the same. Trading fees on GDAX are low to none, go check out or google GDAX fees
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:56:28
holy fuck are the fees insane or something? I'm trying to send some BTC and the fee amounts to around 50 usd???

@_date: 2017-12-04 15:08:16
Yes GDAX is a more advanced exchange with less fees
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:19:50
fiat is currency like usd, euros, i use the dash to mean "to" so like USD to BTC
