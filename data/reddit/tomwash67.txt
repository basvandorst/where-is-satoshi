Bought in at $500. Riding it to 1M moon money.

Shill. You posted the same in /btc. We can see your comments in that post.

Your answer is in your second sentence. What stock would you say compares?

Ever been in a good work environment where people believe in what they do makes a difference? It is kinda like that but instead of ice breakers and cake we do Lambos and moons.

If you invest $1000 and BTC is 20,000 then BTC would need to go to 40,000 (double) for you to double your money.
Each 1,000 swing in the price of BTC (5%) would swing the price of your investment 5%. For $1000 that number would be $50.

Breaking the psychological barriers this week will make the next rise after a ‘correction’ even quicker. 
There will be manipulation, but I’m not budging. Let JP Morgan lose. HODL

For those who bought at +15k I’d say they didn’t have much sense to begin with. Personally, I’m guessing maybe a few worldwide but how many suicides might be caused by USD hyperinflation? Only time will tell.

It’s an open question whether Trump’s new appointees to the Fed Board will follow the legacy of Paul Volcker. Which is to say, whether they’ll be willing to make steep rate hikes that risk recession to stave off an inflationary spiral.

I bought my first bitcoin in 2016. At that time it was under 1k and I would have never considered myself a fanatic. I know about 10 people right now who at any point can tell me the price of bitcoin within 1,000$. Back then the answer would’ve been 0. My point is, if it gets to sub $1,000 those same folks would of course buy (and I would too).
There is much more money on the sidelines than we all think. Safe to hodl and just let the markets play out.

Yes it had. I heard about it around $100 years before. Check out how much the bank stocks have improved since 2008. There is always room for growth after a crash :-)

Damn, ur right. I’m freaking out now. All these new things are scaring me. I’m never going to let the cronies capture my business!

So I did this from KeepKey to Ledger nano but I see my ETH does not display. I found out that the devices use different ways to show ETH. Should I send my ETH from keepkey to coinbase then to the Ledger?

Share the screenshot showing your short position then...

Keyword is market. Name something this is not manipulated? My money is a hedge against US debt and the idea that our economy can grow exponentially forever. The fed is THE market manipulator here. I’m not afraid of a few whales but I guess we can both live in whatever bubble we believe in.

You just made a great argument for some sort of decentralized system. It would be awesome if something like that existed so all people could have the same level of transparency. Maybe someday...
