There are many reasons for using off blockchain transactions including speed of verification as mentioned before.  Micro-transactions is another example.  Ease of use is another reason for using off block chain transactions within trusted networks.  
It is unclear if side chains are the answer here or not. It is evolving and many would say they are not.
However lets stay focused and realize that both the management of bitcoins and how small payments occur still needs improvement for the general population to use the currency.  It will require some compromises. I think 2014 will lead to some improvements in this area.

This is a question that continues to haunt the community and regulators. When the IRS called it an asset and said capital gains applied it in many ways became a commodity/security.  Interestingly in the recent Bitcoin NY  there was a group of folks from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange there.  They must be thinking it might be a commodity or they would not be there.  
sqig brings up some good points regarding securities and where bitcoin may fall in the definition.

I agree in many ways it does for it to succeed as a currency for transactions

We still have a lot of work before this will become practical. Depending on where the bitcoin price goes these could become a micro transactions causing issues.  I think we need a lot more brick and mortar merchants accepting it before we will see it adopted here.  A processor or off chain is of no value unless they are willing to take the risk on the payment as well.
