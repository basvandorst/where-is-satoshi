Those aren't facts, they are myths that sound nice which is why everyone keeps repeating them. Fruits have tons of sugar, so does milk (lactose) - that's a good thing. Sugar is our best fuel. Like I said, just give it 10 years for people to realize that there is no 'devil' macronutrient. 
Dates, grapes, etc... full of sugar. We have been eating those fruits for a long long time. I didn't recommend to eat tons of sodas and processed sugary snacks. I said to eat fruits and milk. But whatever. Like I said, in 10 years people are gonna look dumb just like people who eat margarine look dumb.

Oh if you want to compare keto to bitcoin you really can't. If you want to go down that road, keto would be dogecoin.
The satoshi nakamoto of nutrition is this dude called Raymond Peat. He has a site  
Full of articles on nutrition.. get to reading if you really value your health. But if not then you can wait 10 years for popular knowledge to catch up with him.
 
I wouldn't call him or myself 'experts'. all the experts are fucking idiots and I hate every one of them for being fucking retarded. sorry im getting mad. lol

I use a throwaway because I don't trust you yet

oh no i dont mean i dont trust that you are genuine in your tipping, its just that im wary of any new service (changetip) in the bitcoin space. im keeping a safe distance for now.

Just drink regular coke. It's the only one that actually does whatever it is that coke is supposed to do. 
Did you know that sugar is actually not that bad for you? It helps to boost your metabolism. But I digress. Most of my studies are in nutrition. Right now the current war on 'sugar' is going to look as dumb as the war on fat did 10 years ago. Can you believe people actually chose to eat margarine instead of real butter? Rofl.

That's a dangerous diet. Did you read the study of the swedes who developed gastric cancer due to a low carb diet? Your digestive tract can't produce as much mucus as it needs to when carbs are low. 
Anyways bro, carbs are needed for your metabolism and your brain to function properly.
I'll give it up to keto, it is a great diet for losing weight, but it is too stressful on the human body. Instead of cutting out all carbs, just cut out starches (rice, bread, pasta, oats, etc) and eat a lot of fruit and milk for your carbs. 
You will still lose weight I promise.
But i've only been doing this for half my life so whatever. I understand how it feels to know you 'found the best diet'. So I won't try and change your mind. Just know there are other options out there.

@_date: 2014-05-10 07:35:59
Yes it does work, and very well for weight loss. I just worry for the long term health of those who do such things.
I had a friend do very well on keto for losing weight as well. He was very sedentary though. I don't think I would recommend it to an active individual.

If one wants to ingest a soda, it is better to pick the least harmful one!
Coke zero contains aspartame, a known carcinogen. 
Out of all the coke choices, regular coke (preferably made with sugar and not HFCS) is the best option. Like I said earlier, the sugar boosts metabolism, the CO2 helps with bloodflow and metabolism as well, and the high acidity increases digestive power. It shouldn't be a staple of your diet, but one soda isn't going to harm you. 
Like I said, just wait 10 years. You are really way to 'of the time' to argue against me. You need to spend 7 years reading before you can even try to dispute what I've said.

Steve jobs died from a fruitarian diet.
A frutarian diet misses out on essential micro and macro nutrients from animal organs like liver, dairy, animal meats, etc. 
Fruit did not cause his cancer. Pufa and depletion of nutrients probably did though. 
Any extreme diet is wrong of course, but the war on sugar is a fad. If you can't see that then you are falling into the same trap as everyone else did 10 years ago. 
Sugar doesn't cause insulin resistance either. Pufa does though. 
But honestly, i'm not here to change people's minds. I'm tired of speaking against a wall. Most people aren't smart enough to figure things out on their own - they have to wait for everyone else to come to a conclusion before they feel comfortable taking it as well.
