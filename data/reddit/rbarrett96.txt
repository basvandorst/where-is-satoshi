You would think there would be a fee to transfer to an external wallet not to transfer back to Coinbase/GDAX wouldn't you? It's in their best interest for them to have you keep your money on their site.  Also, how much exactly is a "small fee"

There was pullback....if you waited till 11,300 ;)

Whose fault was it? I'm kind of new as to keeping up with news. Just got on here. I heard about some BCC insider trading and infighting among btc'ers.

Day trading can be fun, but also very addicting. I lost 560 in profits selling too early and got back in after it went up 2000.  I made it up when it peaked briefly when I sold at 19200 and then bought back at 17600.  Be careful.  I'd only sell when it goes parabolic, straight up because that is about the only time you know for sure it's coming back down.  And even then...

Bcash crashed because bitmain released their new miners. Their site only accepts bcc as payment. So everyone got all excited about the coinbase announcements and pushed the price up and all the miners pulled out to buy their antminers

Does this mean it had to be that exact date or anything since then?

Buy low my friend, buy low.

Ripple is super cheap though and just putting $50-$100 in could pay off if more and more banks start adopting it. Seems to be one of the few bank friendly technologies. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:18:42
What I meant is sell B2X immediately to get more bitcoin. Not sure if didn't clearly explain myself.  
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:02:10
If you keep them in separate wallets though you should be good right?
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:01:15
And if you're on gdax you pay no fee at the point, right? ;)
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:23:06
Or not? lol

I was going to specifically ask about that strategy.  I think it's called time-cost investing or something along those lines? The idea being that whether you buy to high, you'll also be buying low so it ends up evening out and the rate of return is essentially the same.  Do I have that right?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:38:05
Isn't the whole idea behind this to have hold some or even buy more BTC and just sell your new B2X coins or whatever they're called to buy more bitcoin after the fork?  What do you have to lose long term? We've had 3 bubbles now and have recovered from all 3 within a year.  If you're buying and selling constantly, then sure.  But you'd want to sell about a week before the fork I'd imagine and buy low after.  I'm planning on keeping my initial 1K investment (at $5,500) and buying more after the dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:06:51
So fork and sell is what I'm hearing lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:27:25
It's the equivalent of pwned in the bitcoin world.  Just a misspelling that caught on. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:43:09
You're referring to limit as opposed to market, correct? That's where there's an asking price more like stocks? I'm still pretty green. Obviously. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:38:53
So that would mean for example waiting for the split on coinbase, getting my separate tokens or B2Xs and then moving the BTC to another wallet after, correct?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:02:43
I'd imagine this applies to a site like bittrex or poloniex as well then? I still haven't figured out how limit orders work.

@_date: 2017-11-02 23:02:03
Very interesting. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:42:24
At this point I feel like I should just buy $50 worth of each and just see who comes out ahead and sell the rest.
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:16:45
So this is where Ether, Dash and others could overtake someday because of scalability then? Which one would you bet on in that case?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:57:39
They addressed that by 1, the fact that some of the XRP is destroyed after every transaction making it a deflationary currency and 2, Ripple put 80 percent of their XRP into escrow smart contracts for four years do they can't touch it till then.  I like the fact that the value of XRP is in it's adoption, not by speculation.  Here is the article I found:

At 20 cents a share, what do you really have to lose? Remember when Bitcoin was $1 a share?  Neither do I.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:43:41
Definitely get a nano and a safety deposit box
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:10:39
Coinbase/GDAX will be splitting the coins and crediting your account.  Now how confident you can feel with selling them for BTC and not worrying about replay is another issue.  I've moved my coins to GDAX so I am ready to sell without fees ASAP.  I'd also recommend having a hardware wallet available to move your BTC coins to immediately after the split. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 23:14:14
I bought $1,000 worth when it was at $5,500 and made almost $300 back in a little over a week.

Prince is gonna have to come back from the grave to rewrite party like it's 9999
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:18:52
But what should your strategy be? For me just holding 1K worth of coin (at 5,500)  doesn't seem like a great investment even over time. I might make 10-20k. Not enough for a house lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:47:26
Problem is there isn't really anywhere besides gdax and coinbase you can buy with actual cash. Everything else is crpyto to crypto or tether
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:23:41
What about the notice on bitcoin.org advising not to keep your bitcoin prior to the fork to avoid replay and other issues but to keep it offline?
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:35:19
I was having the same conundrum about whether to put in more to ever extra BT2 after the fork to reinvest or just wait and buy low after.  I'm thinking of just hedging my bets and putting in $500 before the split and another $500 after if it dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:37:36
It appreciates based on use, not speculation.  That's why I like it.  The more banks adopt it, the more valuable it becomes.  I have no problem losing 100 bucks in relation to what the returns could be.  Even if it tops off at say 50 bucks in a few years it'll make it more than worth it. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 21:40:43
And with only 15% of support for B2X, why would anyone think it would win out? 
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:41:44
I did just buy $50 worth of ripple and will continue to buy that shit up.  Seems like the future being bank friendly and all.
