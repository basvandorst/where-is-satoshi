Argentinian here!

Remember 2008? Not always a good idea

I am from Argentina, but I saw The Big Short movie. We had something similar in the year 2001 with dolar loans, the amount owed was greater than the assets and lots of people ended up bankrupt.

Even if you have the money to pay real estate in cash you cannot even get a 5% ROI (land is expensive, labor is expensive, rent is "cheap").
Here it sucks as an investment, you are better investing in index funds (or btc).

It's stable in your country, I live in Argentina, here is common to have 40% devaluation (poof savings gone) or banks/government create a "corralito" (meaning they take your bank savings)
If you don't need btc that is ok. Enjoy your stable life.

It is also 5x what it was 18 months ago. Would you complain if a stock 5x in 18 months?

Cultural thing, father and grand father saved in USD (to buy land or house).
Also USD is more liquid (nobody will refuse dollars, good luck getting someone to accept your gold) and less volatile than gold.

It sucks for Argentinians but not that much for tourists, it's not going to have big changes.
I would avoid Bs As like the plague (hate big cities), but if you like that, go, you will not notice big changes.
There are so many beautiful places in Argentina: Salta, Cataratas Misiones, Bariloche, Glaciar Perito Moreno, Puerto Madryn just to name a few. Anyware outside Bs As is very safe.

No bank will give you a loan in pesos for a house. 
You can get a loan with variable installments (crazy risk and horrible interest rate)

dollar-peso by end of the year: elections may change this, but at least 75, could go to 100.
elections/thoughts: If not 2020 by 2021 we'll get hyperinflation, lots of bonds need to be paid and no money to cover all debts.
Savings: Most cannot save shit and the "culture" is to spend NOW before the price increase, ergo no saving culture. Those that save money (minority) save in USD. Right now bank accounts pay 4.5% A MONTH interest rate but still, that is going to be way less than the inflation. Last year bank paid about 30% a year in pesos but we had a devaluation of more than 100% (we went from 27 pesos = 1 dollar on Aug 8 to 40 pesos = 1 dollar in 37 days.
Crypto: I got some BTC but crypto is not big here in Argentina, I've been hodling since it was 400 USD but Argentinian Media started talking about crypto late last year.

fixed: de 27 a 40 en 37 dias.

crazy shit all over the place

Buenos Aires is not Argentina, if you go to Purmamarca Jujuy, for example, you can wear a suit made of 100 USD bills and you will be ok.
Buenos Aires, Rosario, or Cordoba? (the biggest cities) you need to avoid bad neighborhoods and don't show your brand new iPhone while walking. That's it, chances of getting mugged are not that different than other cities around the world.

You can also compare it with any product, oil, bread, chicken, the peso lost more than half of its value last year and looks like it's gonna happen again this year.

When you regulate stuff you kill your trade, no trade no usd.
You have debt in usd but no usd you print crappy money (pesos) and that is inflation.
The biggest problem is the fiscal deficit, the high taxes, and the fact that more than 50% of people live from the government (unsustainable).

Don't forget when they stole the retirement funds (us peeps inagine 401k being stolen).
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:52:08
A year ... maybe 2. I'm leaving Argentina in 2 months, won't stay to watch it while it happens.
@_date: 2019-05-21 16:43:24
Populism, that is why.
Most Argentinians believe that is a good thing.
Other countries were wiser or had a Militar government that got rid out of the populism cancer, that did not happen here, even militar gov did populism.
Why do I bring militar govs if they can be populist or not? Because in militar govs usually is easier to make big changes (no need to wait for congress approval). 
That is the biggest difference with Chile, once they got back to democracy they kept all economic pro markets change done by Pinochet.

It's not that bad now, we'll get there when we get hyper inflation (2020 or 2021)
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:33:17
I would not say politically alive, surveys say that Cristina Kirchner (former president) may beat Macri.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:50:24
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:14:50
That is right, no p2p outside bs as

Debatable? I beg to differ, also the Chliean GDP growth also does not agree with you. Same reforms took place in Paraguay and Peru, result same GDP Growth.
Your article focuses on a very short period, what happened after that? It's like doing a strict diet + lots of exercise when you are overweight. At first, you feel like you are going to die, the worst feeling ever, but once you overcome it and you keep doing it, you get results.
What's the opposite of Chile? Closed economy, lots of regulation, big BIG state: What do we have here? Argentina, Venezuela, Cuba (this one is a different story, economic blockade blah blah blah let's leave this one out) and what happened there? DECADES with no growth.
About the human rights thing, did I support Militar governments? HELL NO!, we had them here in Argentina, thousands died. 
False information? again, check GDP that is the only thing that matters long term, with growth you get better employment and then better wages and you improve all over the place.
Here in Argentina we always had socialist governments (even during militar govs) and what was the result? we never got below 30% poverty rates, and .... our poverty is not the same as US poverty.
If you believe socialism is a good thing is just because you did not have enough of it in your life, and I hope you never do.
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:34:15
UNBEARABLE STINKY SHIT!, it does not stink as much as the bolivar (Venezuela) but ... depending on the elections this year we may get close to the smell of that crap!
@_date: 2019-05-21 02:22:42
Argentinian fellow, wanna ask something about our shitty currency? shoot!
@_date: 2019-05-21 10:43:39
I'm a freelancer, work for a companies around the world, I hold usd and euros, I bring to Argentina just enough pesos to cover living expense.
By the end of the month I have like the equivalent of 20 usd in my pesos bank account, when the pesos value dropped in half last year I lost like 10 USD ��
BTC is not very liquid here, we have no easy way to access the money like in usa or europe, no card, and exchanges take many many days, so ... I just put money that I know I'm not going to need for at least 5 years.
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:48:39
He looked like that, but did exactly the same.
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:38:49
53% in 7 years? .... LOL we had more than that this year (Argentinian).
Waiting for Venezuelan to laugh at my inflation.
