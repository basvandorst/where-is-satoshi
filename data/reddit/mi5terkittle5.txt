They even put little squares for you to write the 15 letter password inside on the PDF of the key backup.

The password is a string of 15 letters for a single address wallet.

Almost the exact same thing happened to me. I had my phone stolen that had the 15 character password for a single address account stored in a folder with the encrypted private key. I did not have access to a printer to print the paper at the time, but I do have a email copy of the backup.pdf. I, too, have been desperately trying to find a way to get my coins out, and it is extremely frustrating. 
 
Losing the phone also made everything that uses 2-FA virtually impossible to use, because I also happened to destroy the laptop that had any backups on it in a stupid accident. This has really soured me on the 2-factor authentication deal, as this seems to happen to me on a semi-regular basis of losing/destroying/being robbed of my secondary devices. Now I'm unemployed, too, and am becoming desperate. 
I would rather be able to just scan the QR code that I have without being forced to memorize an impossible amount of information assuming I will always have access to it. The asshole that stole my phone is too stupid to know what to do with that kind of stuff anyway, and I don't really feel important enough to be specifically targeted by hackers. If I had multiple BTC laying around I would take the extra steps to keep it safe on my own without being forced into it.
I feel your pain, man. Sometimes shit just happens and the hole keeps getting deeper. If you ever figured out a workaround, please let me know in a PM or this thread.

Sorry I guess I didn't post the shot correctly.
I backed it up and reloaded it using a 12-word mnemonic.
EDIT: Excuse me, 13 word

So, I'm guessing you're implying that they compromised the wallet's keys, and then wrote a script that would immediately send all incoming transactions back out with high transaction fees to head off a double spend reversal, and just let it sit until something happened? That makes sense, I suppose. They would've had to have been an unknown actor, as I definitely only know maybe one person IRL with the skill to do something like that. I noticed that the receiving wallet started with a 3 which I believe indicates a multi-signature wallet, and that is something I rarely deal with.

Thanks for that info. They are relics from when my father owned this phone, then passed it on to me when he got a new one as my old one was failing. I will delete those ASAP, do you think that after I delete them they might still be able to screw with my accounts and I should wipe everything?

They are not in the same block apparently but were received at the same time to the second as far as I can tell.

My phone is locked with a passcode, and I doubt that anyone I know who could've possibly cracked that code could pull off something of this magnitude due to their very limited technical capability. It is running Android 6.0.1 with security patch level 2018-08-01 which is as high as my phone can get to AFAIK. I do have some apps of poor quality but they are usually deleted quite soon. I do have Free Bitcoin Spinner installed that I had installed to pay out to my Coinbase address and never uninstalled after I received like $0.15 payout. Do you think this could have been using a backdoor into my electrum wallet?

This is an old wallet, and it is not the same phone. However, all my old phones are totally wiped and sold, or broken down for scrap. This phone, however, was my fathers and he gave it to me when he got a new one.
He did have a couple of BTC price trackers installed on it that I neglected to uninstall until just now. I assumed he didn't have really garbage apps, but looking at them now I see that they are pretty bad but at least one was listed at the top of the list. I see where he screwed up.
I haven't been keeping up with BTC scams lately, how common is this with these dodgy price trackers, etc?
