Well, at least we don't have to choose between the devil and the devil's competitor.

We don't have much things here. In Coruña you can exchange the bitcoins for fiat in the ATM. It is not the best solution, but at least you'll have food. If not I think there's some other exchanges there, look in localbitcoins.

Here tips are entirely optional. They don't appear in the receipt. They are usually less than 1 or 2€ even if you have paid 40 for the meal.

Wow! The ticket comes with a "tip" space? Never seen that!
I'm not joking, there's been a bunch of pics of people buying with bitcoin in the past, but I've never seen something like that.

"Hey! It's me, your game. I've noticed you haven't let us access your contacts and history calls. I won't let you play until you let us access it.. here's the permissions dialog again!"
@_date: 2018-04-17 08:40:54
That option doesn't exist in Android 6 at least.. But anyway if you deny and tick don't ask me again the game will be stuck in that dialog so you may as well uninstall it.
Edit: I am talking in general and not about this particular case.

Are they mining solo or at a pool?
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:15:09
Maybe it's related to the attacks with ransomware today to Movistar and other Spanish companies.
@_date: 2017-05-13 08:17:11
Not only in UK. Also in Spain and other countries. In total 74 countries are affected.
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:00:23
In my wallet says it's still unconfirmed. Did you noticed that some addresses have written "Not used"?(I have it in Spanish, so maybe it's a bit different the phrase) Could be that the problem?
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:53:11
I heard a lot about this 
But there are others, if you search a bit. I like this one because you can bet on almost all world leagues of a lot of different sports. Please use my referral link :)
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:03:39
I'm not an expert, but if you successfully created a wallet on an offline pc, then just send coins to the address it shows you. I think in sidebar there a link telling how to store bitcoins safely (I'm on mobile app, I can't see it), that could be useful for you.
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:48:05
Well, I told that if you contact me is because you lost your coins. They don't have any info on their website, so the only bad thing I could do is to steal you the coins you have already lost.

Wow! I hope someday here in Spain shops accept Bitcoins :D

I don't understand exactly what you want to ask with "based in", but if your question is if I am from Nigeria, I have to say no.
@_date: 2013-11-11 20:00:37
Try the other one, if it doesn't work, you are lost, because the wallet.dat is created to work only if you have it entire, to prevent from attacks. So if you have a corrupted one, it won't work :(
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:52:24
 The code you missed was the pin of the phone or the blockchain one?
Edit - From officials website:
What if I forget my PIN?
If you enter an incorrect PIN 4 times you will simply be asked to re-enter the main password. If you forget the main or second wallet password the coins will be inaccessible there is no password reset!

I edited a bit to show what link is referral and what is not, is ok?
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:50:54
It's easy, Satoshi didn't write the code that does that because he didn't want Bitcoins do that. Maybe they thought it would be a more secure system, or more anonymous, who knows?

Most root tools let you unroot when you want, like Unlock Root Pro. The blockchain app must be in "/Android/data/com.blockchain/" or something similar, I don't have it installed on my phone so I don't know exactly, but maybe you find that in Google.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:42:37
If you run a small business, a wallet on mobile (and better also a second wallet on paper or on an offline computer, to store it secured) will be enough.

I can't buy Bitcoins now, and my computer has no enough hardware for mining (I tried, and I didn't get any share on BTC, only got 0.00002 LTC I can't withdrawl ). I have now 0.02 BTC from (old) CoinVisitor, and I hope some day I'll reach my first Bitcoin. If you have any advices for me, tell me please.

First I wanna finish studies :P Bitcoins are a hobby.
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:27:44
You are not going to take so much profit for mining with that hardware. And if the electricity is not free for you, you will pay more for your electricity than you get mining. I think you should buy some when the price decreases, and sell it again when price increases, and do it until you get a decent profit. Or you can start doing some free faucets, or earning seeing videos or so. If you want to know more of getting bitcoins seeing ads, PM me.
PD: There are better wallets that don't need to sync with all blockchain blocks
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:36:03
It's easier that somebody gets your credentials to enter in your cloud-wallet than accessing to your computer. I think the best option is to have various wallets, and have a bit of money in each of them. If you're well protected from viruses, I think nothing will happen ( if you have a large amount of bitcoins maybe makes you more attractive to hackers, so in that case protect your computer very well).

Only, if you are lucky, a person will send you 5 cts., and that's nothing. If you want, I can send you the best 6 faucets via PM, and also I can tell you the most secure way to invest (maybe not much profitable with low investment).
You can buy Bitcoins at Coinbase or at MtGox, it's very secure.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:58:33
If you wanna send your money to a safer wallet, you have to pay the fees.
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:29:08
You can see it in Blockchain
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:36:57
I think the best option for you is to install multibit on computer, buy some bitcoins and transfer it to computer. If you want to have some 'cash' in your pocket, you can also install Bitcoin Wallet from Google Play, or BlockChain(For android and iOS).

@_date: 2013-12-02 18:54:33
You can buy as much as you want, some people here buyed 0.1 BTC but is best to buy higher quantities depending on website taxes.
@_date: 2013-12-10 15:17:33
Checked now. Their changed their domain, please click on the link I posted. If you had an account previously then you can also check your email, they sent that info.

Yes, but it is secure

Tested now on my mobile 
@_date: 2013-10-27 10:10:29
Yeah, I searched there, and there's only one person "near" me that wants to sell from 10 to 5000 BTC, and 10 Bitcoins is a lot of money, but ill search. Also, I want my friends start to use it, and that's my goal now, I'll try to buy when price decreases.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:01:47
You should know that using faucets gives you money with a lot of fees, so if you spend it, you would pay more fees than if you sent only the bought ones

I'll try:
When making a payment, the more kilobytes you send, the greater the fee.
Every transaction you receive, uses some kb.
For example, if you get 1 bitcoin in a wallet, and 2 payments of 0.5 bitcoins each in another one, and then you pay something that costs 1 bitcoin, with the first wallet you'll pay 1 bitcoin minus fees, with the second one you'll have to send the two half bitcoins, paying a fee for the first part, and a fee for the second part, resulting in a fee a bit greater.
When you use faucets, you receive a lot of payments, so the fee is really big in comparison.
But you have to know that also the longer a payment stays on the same address, the fees will pay are smaller.
So I recommend you to have one address for receiving money of faucets, and another one for normal payments. When you need money, send all your faucets money to the non-faucet address, so the fee will be the minimum.
Edit: some small errors
