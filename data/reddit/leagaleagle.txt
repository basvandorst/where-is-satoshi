Rules AKA law AKA if you kill people, you're in deep shit even if there's not dictator or president or prime minister or whatever else
Pick-up ball is anarchic - it has rules and no rulers. NBA is regulated and has a governing body that is upheld by force - get rid of the US government, and then it too is anarchic, despite having rules and hierarchy. 
Bitcoin is anarchic because it has no rulers, no central force that makes things happen.

Anarchism means without rulers, not without rules. Bitcoin is anarchic, not lawless. There are rules built into the technology, like consensus.

Yes. Being in the moment is easier if you embrace it physically instead of mentally. Thoughts are like a river that you can at best direct, but only unreliably.
I have minor PTSD (probably, who knows how minor it is; I have it), and my therapy revolves around getting out of my head and getting into what I'm doing. This is not professional advice, but:
identify a thought as a thought. If you are working on something and a thought comes in like "shit, how am I going to pay that bill?" or "my wife is going to be mad at me for this" or even just "is it supposed to rain tomorrow", instead of pursuing the thought, say to yourself "I have a thought about my wife being mad at me for something". Identify the thought, then leave it alone and get back to what you're doing.
This is aided by connecting to your surroundings on a physical level. Feel the weight of your body in your chair, your feet in your shoe, touch something tactile with your hand. Hear the sounds around you: the buzz of a computer, background chatter, etc. Literally "come to your senses". This has helped me get out of my head and get back into the moment.
There are entire books about this, but some forms of meditation are basically this, by focusing on breathing. This helps me with day-to-day activities, to help me stop my mind from racing, and to help my body calm down. It's a much more tangible exercise than it is a pure thinking exercise.

Plenty of people say Bcash because it's easier.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:27
People getting offended by "bcash" isn't controversial to a regular person, it's controversial because bcash supporters are insecure at their shitcoin. If it could stand on its own two feet, they wouldn't worry about it, but it has no legitimate merit and it has to use the bitcoin name to have any value.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:08:46
I have three names, I go by a shortened version of one of them. Bcash is an adequate shortening of the overlong name.

It's called bcash the same way the UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! is frequently called the US despite whatever its official name is, or in the case of something more relevant, we just called it China even though it's ridiculously referred to as the PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

@_date: 2017-12-20 18:12:18
What do you call one unit of bcash? A bitcoin cash coin? What the fuck? It's a dumbassed name that was made to capture the reputation of bitcoin. I think bcash is dumb as fuck, but that doesn't negate that calling it bcash is a lot easier than "Bitcoin Cash" which sounds like calling someone by their first and middle name.

Double negatives are frequently confusing and should not be used. Beyond that, Ver's pathetic insistence that bcash be called Bitcoin Cash is only going to cement the idea that it's a joke version of the real thing.

Doctors are getting burnt out in some of these countries. The care is rationed - it has to be, the supply is not high enough.

Taking out loans in a deflationary money - no thanks! If real inflation is 7%, I'm still beating out my student loan interest rates. But I just want that money back in my pocket each month regardless. I'd just keep buying more crypto with it, though.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:19:45
By what standard? Plenty of things have inflated far more quickly than that, in addition to static wages - plenty of estimates have "real inflation" at around 7%.

Eh, my student loans aren't far off from a tesla, and I'll still cash out my btc to pay them off if the btc price rises that high. Other people probably want a tesla as badly as I want to be out from under my student loans ($900 a month really sucks), and are ready to see btc rise even higher. If btc really does rise that high, I'll already have won the lottery. No point in being overly greedy.

Do you know what proof is? Do you understand the difference between correlative relationships and causal relationships? Clearly, you don't, because you can't prove cause in economics. It cannot be done, it will never be done.

What other investments are "backed"?
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:02:01
I know. I've worked in healthcare for years on the finance side of things. I know how completely broken the American system is. But socialist medicine (medicaid/medicare for all) would be worse than what we have now. 
There are tremendously powerful figures in all these industries (medical education, pharmaceuticals, hospitals, insurance, etc) that are deeply vested in maintaining the status quo. 
We don't have enough supply of doctors. If doctors are seeing 30 patients a day (which is a ton!) and not everyone can get seen, then obviously one core issue is the way we educate and train doctors and the rate at which that happens. Another is licensing - there are powerful monopolies on licensing, and prejudice against DOs from doing the same work as MDs, despite the fact that DOs receive the very same training and take the same level of tests.
American healthcare is an example to no one - expensive and inefficient and deeply bureaucratic - but I'd still only get care here in the US, in Germany, Switzerland, or Japan. 
All that said, the answer is not socialized medicine. From a logistical and a deontological view, it doesn't work. Doctors should not be forced to provide care, and that applies to everyone down the chain.

You can't empirically prove shit outside of physics, chemistry, and biology. That's the biggest load of nonsense I've ever heard.
I've done my homework. Economics is not science. The softer the field gets (physics/math being the most stringent), the more soft and flimsy the data is. Piketty can study data as much as he wants, but if the data is wide open to interpretation, which it is, then it doesn't matter. That's great that he's addressed the concerns of academics, but here's the truth:
Economics is the attempt to study human behavior on macro levels. Sure, there's the micro-economic view, but the economics we're talking about are very macro. That doesn't make it worthless, but there is no objective truth in economics. This is why the Austrians reject a "scientific" approach to econ, because there is no such thing. There are no perfectly controlled trials, there is no ability to find true cause, the best you can ever get is correlation. There will never be laws in economics like there are in physics. It's not a science. It never will be. It cannot be.
I have done my homework. I always do. I don't think Piketty is an idiot, but I certainly don't agree with him, no matter how many people do.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:08:13
What a baby. Can't provide a counterargument, so you just downvote and supply a condescending link. Piketty might make some convincing arguments, but nothing that can be proved. There will never be laws of economics that are equivalent to thermodynamics or relativity or gravity or motion. Ultimately it's down to his bias and interpretation of things. If you agree with his interpretation, then you agree with it. That does not make it more or less true.

What do you mean by "backed"? Like, if it goes to 0, someone gives you your money back? Yes, you get to keep your dividends you've earned so far, but I'm pretty sure you're not getting a refund if your stock loses all its value.

Fair point about dividends. But that's not a stock being "backed". I mean, you can sell BTC at any time. You can be left holding the bag on anything, and it's happened to people before. Most stuff doesn't crash to 0. Bitcoin probably never will either.

How would you have single payor without it being socialized? You can't just dissolve Aetna or Blue Cross or Humana and end up with single payor without socialized medicine - they are part and parcel with each other.
I don't know what the best next step is with healthcare, but I think there are simple things that could be done, although simple doesn't mean easy. The hard part with healthcare is that it's very challenging to enter the market on any front - from the data side, the financial side, the clinical side - it's hyper-regulated compared to most markets in the US, so you don't get the benefit of competition that you do in other fields.

Not going anywhere. I'm investing with what I can afford to lose. Bought in at $4300; I'll keep riding and see what happens.
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:10:23
I bought at close to 4400, then at 4200. I'm personally grateful to be able to get bitcoin for cheaper. I buy every couple of weeks, a few hundred at a time. It'd be nice to get up to 1 full BTC by the end of the year. 
I'm mentally prepared for BTC to be low until 2020, or to at least hover in the 3000-4000 range and not make any substantial climbs. If that's the case, I could have 5 BTC by then. That's not a ton, but I'm coming into the game late.
I fundamentally believe in the technology and the decentralized nature of BTC. I remember being very intrigued by it back in 2012/2013 and not understanding how to buy any. Coinbase gets a lot of complaints, but it definitely made it easier for a noob like me to get into the game, and the Trezor helps it be nice and safe.
