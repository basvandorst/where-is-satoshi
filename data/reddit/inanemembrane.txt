It is very soon I think this says it is 98% on github.

They are motivated by holding btc and or care about it as a political means. But they might be getting paid by like minded people.
@_date: 2013-08-07 14:30:15
It am sure it will deter a tiny fraction of potential bitcoin users. I think it's worth it to promote political ideas, and politicians that will protect bitcoin to a much larger number of people than the number that will be deterred.

Most libertarians support a limited democracy or democratic republic. Which is what we have in the USA. Or used to at least.
@_date: 2013-08-04 09:32:05
I stand corrected. There is dutch party with 3 known members and 0 representatives. Still I got a laugh. There are many horrible people in the world. I think none of them are principled libertarians. If you are wondering how i would describe a principled libertarian, think the opposite of Koch brothers.
@_date: 2013-08-06 06:12:43
Which is evidence that supports my hypothesis. Thanks for pointing that out. It frustrates me that so many people on this sub deny the extent of the alignment between the motivations behind bitcoin and the principles of libertarianism.
@_date: 2013-08-04 17:08:34
I didn't mean to imply that. I accept that it is a party and possibly a philosophy. The distinction is that it is not one to be concerned with like you should be with the 2 major parties and the LP, or modern liberalism, conservatism, and libertarianism.
@_date: 2013-08-07 18:51:08
Yes but the harder it is to convert them into dollars the more slowly bitcoin use will grow.

He wants the federal government out of many things. He doesn't want the state and local governments out of nearly as many things, environmental regulation for example.

How many votes did the Legalization party(or whatever its called) candidate receive in the 2012 presidential election? The Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson received over 1.2 million voters, or .99% of all votes cast. Don't forget that the Libertarian Party and Gary Johnson are also legalization advocates.

He was referring to the pay rate of teachers i think. Nurses make much more than 35k.

I was aware of that and I desperately wish we had 3 or more influential parties in the United States. A key thing to consider is that libertarianism is also a political philosophy. The parties in Europe and elsewhere with more libertarian leaning members and politicians are much more likely to support bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-04 04:47:21
I reread them. Still don't get it. It seems you want bitcoin to be politically agnostic so as to not unnecessarily conflate it with any philosophy. I understand and sympathize with that desire but I think it is in bitcoin users interest to promote libertarians and libertarianism because it will certainly decrease the chances of regulation.
@_date: 2013-08-31 06:14:36
The year 2001. The last year the NSA did its job. I wonder what could have caused this. Did any major events occur? There wasn't like some horrible law passed that year was there?
@_date: 2013-09-17 08:02:48
Yeah it would better fit with the other currencies or commodities at least but whoever made that decision might have thought those classifications would be too much of an endorsement of it. I think it does reflect a stigma of its supposed high level of risk. 
Apparently it is an equity because its a fund that invests in bitcoin or something. I don't get it.
@_date: 2013-08-04 14:10:55
That party has 3 known members among the entire population of Netherlands. I don't think you need to worry much about them being influential.
@_date: 2013-08-05 23:32:38
Which is why bitcoin users and supporters should at least consider supporting libertarians and libertarianism.
@_date: 2013-08-03 22:02:14
Libertarians would never regulate or otherwise block bitcoin from rising to prominence. Republicans and Democrats potentially would. I think that is a decent reason for supporting How about putting it to a vote?
edit: I was mistaken. The title from an article about the prosecution of that bitcoin ponzi scheme lead me to think that the SEC had taken steps towards regulating bitcoin. My apologies. Still, are you sure governments won't try to regulate bitcoin at some point?
@_date: 2013-08-08 04:26:39
Drugs is not a political philosophy or party so I don't think its a relevant argument. I am sure there are political parties and maybe philosophies that are based on advocating for drug legalization but I am sure they are much less prominent than libertarianism and the LP.
@_date: 2013-08-31 16:39:29
That seems like an anti-conspiracy theory. He is theorizing that he went all Snowden and decided to create bitcoin to undermine conspirators in the government. I guess that sort of theorizing is very welcome inbut so is support of bitcoin. Considering what is known about him and how little is known it seems like a pretty reasonable theory. Maybe it wasn't the the NSA. Maybe it was a different agency or even department. Maybe he worked at the Fed. He definitely didn't like fiat money.
@_date: 2013-08-04 00:10:52
Yes you are correct. I was confused. Thanks for correcting me. The reason you should support libertarians and more libertarian parties is because they will support and protect bitcoin more than the alternative parties and philosophies.
@_date: 2013-08-04 10:00:35
I agree. It is in the interest of every government, except the US, for bitcoins to rise to prominence.
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:59:01
Because it will become less of an issue eventually does not mean we shouldn't fight it now.
Regulations can make it harder for those vendors to convert to fiat and discourage them from accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-31 06:08:53
Could you explain and/or provide a source please?
@_date: 2013-08-07 05:44:40
And many here think the government won't try to regulate bitcoins. If they can figure out how to, they eventually will. If you care about bitcoins remaining unregulated you should support libertarians and other politicians who expressly state that they will not regulate bitcoins. Hence, I think should promote in the sidebar, if not in a banner as has done for @_date: 2013-08-04 13:45:09
I was referring to parties and people with political power mainly. How many leaders in the Communist party support bitcoin. Also every government other than the US has more reason to like bitcoin because the US dollar is the dominant world currency and its status as such gives the US government more power.
@_date: 2013-08-07 14:30:43
I am not an ancap. Fuck yourself off good sir.
@_date: 2013-08-07 14:34:35
They can't enforce direct regulation of bitcoins, but they can regulate and impinge on the ability to convert them into dollars, right?
@_date: 2013-08-04 09:49:24
Most certainly that is more than fine. I consider myself quite libertarian bordering on voluntaryist and there are quite a few issues where I disagree with the majority libertarian position. On most of those there is a significant minority that agrees with me.
The biggest example of this is the issue of corporate political donations. I have long been uncertain on this issue especially since PACs and SPACs. Recently I realized that there is ample libertarian and especially voluntaryist/ancap justfication for being for limiting corporate political donations. Basically once you realize the extent and intractability of otherwise fixing crony-capitalism, limiting donations is the only practical option. I think a small majority of libertarians disagree with me. If you take out the republican-libertarians it shifts towards my view. I am trying to convince more libertarians to see it my way. 
@_date: 2013-08-04 14:22:08
I will try to remember. Going back to sleep soon. Remind me via pm if you wish.
@_date: 2013-08-03 23:38:04
I didn't say or mean to imply that they need to. I was suggesting that it is in interest to do so
@_date: 2013-08-08 06:54:37
I agree. I never said otherwise and that contradicts nothing I have said.
@_date: 2013-08-08 05:33:10
Awesome. I didn't know that. It doesn't contradict what I said though, does it?
@_date: 2013-08-04 13:27:07
I have 10 real life libertarian friends. Through the internet, I have another 6 friends. So I would say I know 16. 
On the internet I have had reasonably long conversations with over 100. On the internet I have read the opinions of well over 1000.

Child pornographers is not a political party or philosophy.
Edit:The SEC has not moved to regulate bitcoins. Sorry new to the sub or I bet I would have known that.
