Okay Lightning question: In order for a merchant to recieve lightning payments het must have at least 1 channel open with a customer with btc on the customer side of the channel. In the network payments will flow trought these channels. These channels will be super important for the merchant because they will be their gateway to the network. Will this not lead to centralisation and hubs that will keep these channels open as a paid service (through fees for example)?

Realy interesting, not only the second layer but also next level for bitcoin!
Question though: If a merchant wants to intergrate Lightning he opens a channel to a well connected node with, let's say, his daily turnover. The ballance on this channel is 0 to the node and all the btc to the merchant. So his channel is actually unuseble and a dead end in the network.
How can this issue be solved? It seems that a lot of the customers of the merchant need to create own channels to the merchant to have a useble lightning balance for business.

Realy love how the LN is growing, but I got a question though: The majority of channels are filled with like 10.000 sat or s (8 cents) is that channel then not a dead end? Is there also a way to filter out these low channels to only see &lt;$10 channels?

Yeah, I see why we need speed, but if the majority of the channels are filled with a few cents usd, how can lightning be used to buy grocery? Or is it possible to use the same channel multiple times for one payment..?

Still, he states that Lightning will only be used for small trnasactions and that larger tx are better be executed on-chain.. Does that mean I would not be able to buy groceries with lightning? (and at this moment majority of the channels have very small the capacities) Will lightning realy have a use case then?
