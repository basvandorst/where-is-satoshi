A good question for a BitWage interview, wouldn't you agree?

Site looks rather bland , the design really needs work!
But good to see more platforms out there.
@_date: 2015-01-02 20:36:36
if we can get more upvotes it will gain more attention :)
But give it time, I will try and put a video/audio review together at some point :)
Plus, an interview with the creator is being worked on, so any questions you'd like to see answered, just ask them ;)

more seriously, why are people still using wordpress for cryptocurrency blogs? Surely there are better (read : more expensive) options out there.
@_date: 2015-01-05 11:49:00
Why...what? :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:16:56
perhaps people should read the site instead of downvoting things they didn't read?

If we cancel the agreement, we owe them 3 months of wages (3 BTC)
I did contact them to ask for removal :)

I assume that is what the author means. 70% is higher than I thought it would be, so even if we can bring that down to 65%, we are making major progress, right?

not everyone reads Reddit, even though you might think so otherwise :)
The more we spread the news, the more people are informed, and the better for all of us.
Crypto is about working together, not working against eachother.

The Paycoin ad is part of CoinTelegraph ads, which have to be placed on the website as per agreement of being a CoinTelegraph Media Partner.
As far as I'm aware, media partners have absolutely no say in which ads they are forced to put on their website.

it's shame they had to close down in Germany to be honest.
Let's hope some competition emerges in that market soon :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:45:02
of course :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:58:37
oh absolutely, progress has been made :)
Just a shame they didn't hold on to it, but there's always the next one ;)
@_date: 2015-01-03 18:57:25
and this had to do what with cryptoarticles exactly?
@_date: 2015-01-03 09:33:53
I do, but it also redirects to a website with "share" buttons, which Reddit does not have :)
@_date: 2015-01-05 07:46:18
UPDATE : logging in with a 2FA enabled account returns a 403 error, screenshot added in the article
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:06:44
read the disclaimer, near the ad, not my choice :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 19:12:19
do you see a paycoin ad on the site then? Maybe you should click the link instead of listening to others.
but FYI : 
Jean-Pierre Buntinx
Still no reply from  in order to remove the XPY ad. i'm removing it myself then. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 15:40:27
"another device" though?
Don't get me wrong, not saying your diea is bad, in fact, I quite like it :)
But... hmm.. :) 
The existing tech is there tbh, just need to get to word out in a different way.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:13:46
interesting train of thought, I do wonder why they have no contribution link on the website....
@_date: 2015-01-01 15:54:12
Now there is an interesting way to advertise hardware wallets, I like the way you think!
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:50:11
I thought they went out of business? Or was that just for their physical magazine? (if so, apologies!)
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:00:17
Read it properly, all it mentions is how you can LINK accounts, and the inner workings are unclear.
@_date: 2015-01-01 15:12:36
that is definitely a "market" we should be keeping an eye on as well, and thank you for pointing that out :)
