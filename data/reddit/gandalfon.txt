[I'm Russian]
Our country is diving deeper and deeper into shit and people continue to joke around how everything is bad in USA. Sorry for politics reference. But this joke is not funny for me at all, because it is made by someone from my country where the government continues to rob its people for decades and 84% of people support it. We have level of corruption which is one of the highest in the world. Some activists show in details corruption schemes of Putin's friends and other influential people. And nobody give a fuck. But everyone is so ready to laugh about "stupid Americans" and so on.
Edit: spelling

Actually my point was not that *Americans* shouldn't joke about their government. Personally i view this as quite healthy way of behavior in any country. The point was that *Russian* shouldn't joke about America in current circumstances. Interesting fact: this summer you could buy 34 rubbles on 1 dollar. Today you can buy 64 rubbles. And only today dollar/rubble increased by 10%. And nothing like that happened in 2008-2009, when oil was even cheaper than now. It is all about Mr. Putin's policy and approval of it by our people.

What upsets me, is that it isn't really the same as during 1930s-1940s. People really *have* access to adequate information in Russia. There are plenty of news sites without propaganda, blogs and sites like reddit. But most people don't *use* it. It is their choice to watch TV or read blogs full of conspiracy and hatred and live in the imaginary world of sweet lies.

He can be Russian. In our country (i'm from Russia) a lot of people really think, that everything in USA is bad, while we are OK. 
Every actual problem/failure of America is depicted in details in our news (like big hurricane, rocket crash, violent protests, etc.). Usually in more details than our own problems. Besides that different propagandistic "analytical" shows predict every year forthcoming collapse of American financial system and economy. And most people really believe in this shit.
