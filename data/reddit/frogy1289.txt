Wait, if you bought and traded in Q4 but never withdrew I can't just file with my federal taxes? Some bullshit if you ask me.

They pertain to each other? The point was even with the announcements of futures, and the actual event of them opening futures, BTC continues on a positive trend. It has it's dips and corrections like it always has had, but it's a positive trend still. We are up $1000 just today. The ATH was brief and very volatile with unrealistic growth. We had a minor price correction and now we're back on a positive trend approaching that ATH at a more steady and realistic pace.

Dude it's on a *downward spiral* of acouple hundred from the high point today?? Unless they're day trading there's no point. They're hodling for a reason and accept it may fall hundreds or thousands while they watch, or it may go up, who knows.  If you're talking about a downward spiral from 19k+ then you really need to look at the graph on a bigger timeframe, cause it's just a correction from massive growth.

I think you need to zoom out on your graph. Look where Bitcoin was at the beginning of December, and where it is now,  including our market correction from borderline 20k. We're very positive still and in an upward trend even with Futures markets opening.

Nope, it got taken down the first time a couple days ago and the price went up quite abit briefly. This one's been up around 24 hours though. I don't see it lasting overnight if prices continue to bounce around.

Well if anyone has a similar issue: App won't authenticate with a code via authenticator, but over the website using the same authenticator as it was set up with it works fine and logs in.

Sorry it doesn't make sense to me that Coinbase won't load shit or send a SMS to me while iPhone users next to me can access it fine, and then GDAX works like a charm on either system even though they're paired to each other..

Unrealized gain, if you haven't converted to fiat and cashed out it isn't an actual capital gain YET from what I've been told by an accountant as of 3 hours ago.

Only if they can somehow buy an enormous quantity of a scarce resource which is valued highly. You got to have tons and tons of money to do that in BTC compared to others that shall not be named, and then have people willing to sell to obtain said shares of BTC. Honestly if someone had that much money they could do it with plenty of resources on this planet.

I'm not sure we are getting each other, I'm not talking about transactions/sending or buying and selling. I mean straight up the app won't display any graphs, account info, prices on any of the three coins,  litterally anything that isn't my e-mail address won't show. Now I'm logged out and its just as broke.

So there are incidents randomly even when others are fine in the same time period, but has anyone had it resolved, charged, or canceled after such a delay?? Or is it just dead in the water without notification

You converted to fiat then, having money in your account. It also gets hairy if you say, sell at a loss and buy back in even lower than your original loss for a larger amount of BTC then hold, as you had a capital loss but then a potential unrealized gain later on and really gotta do some math. I doubt the IRS is going to kick in your door and shoot your dog ATF style over $100 though.

You won't pay 40% unless you do not hold for a year, and are pretty wealthy/high income. Taxes are based on profits, buying at 9000 that then jumps to 11000 and then you panic sell back at 9000 yields no profit, you broke even. You applied the tax to profits in the first half and second half of your statement even though it would apply to just the first half, were there was an actual profit

Underrated reply, you sir win.

Sounds good to me, is there a fee to transfer from Coinbase to GDAX? I've already had an account setup/verified on all three for awhile now but only used GDAX for it's charts. -Thanks for the information again, Im just trying to find an easy way to avoid replay attacks while remaining on the market
