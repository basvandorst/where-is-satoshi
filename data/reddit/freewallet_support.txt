your transaction is awaiting to be included in one of new blocks. The speed with which your transaction is processed depends solely on the network conditions, and we've posted a notification in the app about possible delays because the BTC network is congested at this point. We realize you're angry, but there's nothing we can do on our side now: please give it some time, your transaction will be posted eventually.

have you tried contacting our support? Freewallet doesn't process exchanges: our partner, [Changelly.com]( does. If your exchanges couldn't be completed, your funds haven't been spent and can be retrieved. Please submit a ticket through our [support portal]( we'd be glad to assist you.

the last piece of correspondence from you we received was the requested additional information on your transaction. As of now, your case is being worked on, and you should get a confirmation on your transaction posted into your account. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:07:54
The minimum transaction amounts for exchanges are listed in the app, we receive them from Changelly. Please remember that cryptocurrency rates are volatile, so if you're sending a sum pretty close to the current minimum and it's updated while your transaction is processed with our partner, it might fail to go through. That's why we're suggesting contacting the party that is actually performing the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:49:33
That's not a web page for exchanges, that's an overview of your Freewallet profile. We use the exchange services provided by Changelly, you can visit their [website]( to check what coins are currently available for the exchange.  
@_date: 2018-01-09 16:16:02
we've sent you multiple requests for your transaction hash, yet we never received this piece of information from you. As a receiving party, we cannot affect the speed of processing your transaction: it depends solely on the network conditions and the network fee you paid for making it. If the fee was low, it can still be awaiting confirmations, just like suggested.
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:28:25
Our wallet has never been hacked despite multiple attempts to do so. Unfortunately, not all our colleagues in the industry can say the same.
@_date: 2018-01-06 08:50:06
please review the information we provided above: as soon as we receive an update from our exchange partner, we'll be able to follow up with you regarding your transaction.
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:43:42
the address you send your Stellar coins to is a smart address used for exchanges to EOS provided by our partner, [Changelly.com]( Exchanges from/to STR were temporarily suspended in the middle of December 2017 on their side; as soon as they are resumed, your transaction will either be pushed or refunded. Either way, your funds aren't lost. 
As soon as we receive an update from our exchange partner, we'll be able to follow up with you regarding your transaction. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:10:32


Any facts to back up your words? People tend to cry scam with any transaction hiccup. Any working service on a highly volatile market, such as the crypto one, can expect to face issues eventually. Google ANY wallet name, and you'll find tons of complaints. What makes us different is that we're actually willing to help our users and are putting a lot of efforts in resolving their issues.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:22:40
all exchanges in Freewallet are powered by our partner, [Changelly.com]( There are minimum transaction amount required for converting one coin to another that we receive from them: they are shown in the app. If you're sending less than the minimum required amount, your transaction won't go through. 
Your failed transaction is currently on a smart address with Changelly. If you'd like to dispute this transaction, please don't hesitate to contact our partner's support: they will be able to review it and get back to you.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:50:52
we're glad to inform you that your refund [was successfully completed]( Please check your Freewallet BTC balance, the funds are available Thanks for choosing Freewallet!
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:54:34
correct: it took some time for your Bitcoin transactions to get posted to the exchange address, then some more time to make a conversion to Bitcoin Cash, then deliver the Bitcoin Cash transactions to you. The hashes you posted are for your original BTC transactions. When you're sending coins to exchange, they have to reach the service wallet first, they are [exchanged by our partner]( further, then delivered to you.
Changelly guarantees the exchanges being made at the best rates. Please contact them to inquire about your transactions. You can also look up the BTC/BCH rates at the time you made your exchanges, if you have concerns. Freewallet doesn't make exchanges, we use Changelly's API, which means your funds are sent to them for exchange, then they deliver the converted coins to you. We don't charge you with any fees except for the network ones; however, they go to the miners, not to Freewallet.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:33:09
please don't panic: transactions among service wallets are normal, our partner, Changelly, is working on your refund. Once it's done, you should be able to see it in your wallet; we'll also follow up with the transaction hash for it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:24:16
our exchange partner is [Changelly.com]( which is specifically stated in our Terms of Use. Moreover, we're often referring to them online, plus they have been mentioned in this very thread, literally a couple of posts above.
We're delivering all refunds, however, each of them requires a certain amount of time and resources. Despite the popular belief, refunds aren't performed with a couple of clicks: they involve technical, security and financial procedures. We're doing our best to speed up the process, and our support reps will notify you once your refund is completed.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:09:32
apologies for the delay! It's natural for people who experience issues with their coins to blame the wallet and accuse it of being a scam; however, eventually we're the ones that are helping people recover their coins. Too bad users tend to be too happy to spend a minute on an update or a "thank you" post, but it's OK :)
Just to remind you, you can't send one currency to an address of another one: as they belong to different networks, such transactions won't be posted properly. Our support reps will be in contact with you regarding your refund; we're in the process of expanding our support team, so the response time can be slightly delayed. We'll make sure to keep you posted!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:35:30
Hello Freewallet is more than one name :) Your request for a refund was received, and our support reps confirmed that it will be completed. Although we put a lot of efforts in making managing your coins quick &amp; simple, refunds are a bit more complicated on the technical side, so it takes time to deliver them. Our support team will update you on the status of it. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:28:45
both your smart transactions (exchanges), one for [0.69 BTC]( and the other one for [0.189222 BTC]( were completed within several hours, not days. There was a minor delay due to the current conditions of the BTC network stuffed: it took time for both of your transactions to get included in new blocks.
Not sure what rate you used to estimate your Bitcoin Cash balance after the conversion, however, your BCH amount wouldn't equal the initial BTC deposit because both network fees and exchange rates were applied to it. All exchanges in the app are powered by our partner, [Changelly.com]( if you have questions regarding your exchanges and rates/commissions applied, please contact our partner directly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:40:41
The only fees applied to outgoing transactions are the network ones. You might also [try our flash transfers]( between Freewallet users: they are instant and with zero fees.

there are exactly 0 **confirmed** scam accusations against Freewallet. People are hasty to call this or that service a scam when something goes not as they've expected. Being a live service on a highly volatile market, it's only natural some issues come up: they are resolved by our support team. Too bad people who got help rarely come back to tell about their positive experience or at least add any updates...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:43
you might have got a wrong idea about what a cold storage is and how smart exchanges are done. Our support team would be glad to provide you with more details on it, if you'd like to. A quick remark: when you make a transaction, your funds are sent out of the cold storage and into a smart address provided by our exchange partner. So as soon as we get the details on your refund from them, we'll make sure to notify you immediately. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:07:27
first of all, please don't panic: both your NXT and your BTC balances are available on your profile. We can assure you that no funds "disappear" from our wallets; nothing can be lost in the blockchain, as you know. It seems you're trying to log in on an Apple device: NXT isn't in the list of coins that Apple approved of, so you can view your NXT balance either in our Multi Wallet app [for Android]( or in [the web version]( 
Please make sure your Internet connection is up &amp; running: poor connection quality would explain why there're issues logging into your account online or loading up the support chat. Try switching to wi-fi or restarting your router if you're on it already. If you're still having issues, please email our support directly at info And have faith, please: we're here to assist you with any questions or issues you might have :)
UPD: Another way to contact us in addition to email &amp; in-app chat would be [the contact form]( on our website.

You could import your coins from any other service with a private key or a mnemonic phrase, for example.
@_date: 2017-12-28 08:25:43
could you provide more information for us to research your situation? For example, your user id from the Settings. So far it's just a very emotional report without much details, and while your frustration is understandable, we'd like to learn some facts to be able to assist you.
There is a number of security measures design to prevent any unauthorized access to a Freewallet account, and we strongly recommend our users enabling all of them. These are:
- Verifying your email address to facilitate restoring the access to your account;
- Enabling the PIN code and/or fingerprint login on your app;
- Switching on the email confirmation (multisignature) option for transactions on your account;
- Enabling the 2-factor authentication to safely access your account.
Regarding the links you've posted, the first 2 were officially acknowledged as fake news and FUD; as for the last one, the OP himself confirmed that no funds were lost. Unfortunately, many people think that their funds are stored on their hot addresses, although we specifically highlight the fact that our users' funds are held in the cold storage as it's much more secure.
Please follow up with more details on your situation, looking forward to hearing from you!
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:52:36
thank you for your message and apologies for the delay! Many people are investing in cryptocurrencies and performing operations with them these days, and our support reps are getting more and more requests. However, we're currently expanding our support team, so the response time should be reduced soon.
Regarding your transaction: what you attempted to do was an exchange from Bitcoin to Monero. However, most likely due to recent network events and the spike of exchange operations, your transaction couldn't be completed by our exchange partner. Such cases are rare, but when they come up, the initial transaction is usually refunded to the sender. That's what our support reps have confirmed with you: your BTC will be refunded to your Freewallet address. 
The request for your refund has already been placed and is currently processed by Changelly. We understand that retrieving your coins is your priority, and we've made it ours as well. Please note though that refunds take time and resources and require completing a number of technical, financial and security procedures, especially when significant sums are involved.
Our support reps will keep you updated on the status of your refund; we will also notify you once it's completed. Thank you so much for your patience and understanding!
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:18:05
please read the thread you're quoting: the rumors about ETH missing from our wallets were just rumors: no funds were lost or stolen from our users. What caught the attention was rebalancing funds among our service wallets associated with the cold storage, one of our key promoted features. Some mistook it for an exit scam, which is what we keep hearing for over 2 years; yet our business record keeps proving the skeptics wrong. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 12:28:06

thank you for your post! It's one of the best examples showing how emotions lead people to wrong conclusions and they start spreading uncorroborated accusations. Let's review your case step by step, and hopefully, you will get a better understanding of how our app works.
To begin with, 1ATHs6pab8TYGTAiio75AqkaKQ8poJEYQ2 is your Bitcoin address. In order to convert Bitcoin to other coins in the app, you send them to a so-called smart address: it's a service address in the same network as your sending address, and the coins sent there are further converted to the desired currency and delivered to your destination address. There are different BTC smart addresses for each coin you're planning to make an exchange to: DASH, EOS and XMR.
Smart addresses don't belong to Freewallet: they are managed by our partner, [Changelly.com]( who is powering all exchanges in the app. When you initiated your exchanged in the beginning of November, there was a spike in the transaction volume because of the Bitcoin Cash fork and the boosting Bitcoin prices: in other words, there were way too many new transactions, and your exchanges couldn't be completed on our partner's side on time. However, your funds weren't lost: when an exchange doesn't go through, we work along with our partner to refund our users.
The time frame for retrieving failed refunds is outlined in our [Terms of Use]( refunds are processed within 60 days from receiving requests from them. Please note that Freewallet isn't performing exchanges and thus doesn't process the related refunds! Neither we set the order in which such refunds are made. We gather the information from our users and deliver it to our partner, and as soon as we get the confirmation on completed refunds, we notify our users about them. We're doing our best to speed up the process and request updates from our partner every day. 
Just like you've confirmed in your post yourself, 2 of your exchanges have already been refunded: one for [0.05 BTC]( another one for [0.1 BTC]( The last one, for 0.16 BTC is being processed by our partner and should be completed within the 60 day time frame. 
As you can see, your funds aren't unaccounted for; moreover, you have already got 2 of your 3 transactions back. We're not sure what makes you think that after you received 2/3 of the refunds we'd hold to the final one, however, that's not the case. Please give our partner the time to get back the rest of the funds to you and make sure you've got a full picture before jumping to conclusions.
**TL:DR**: 3 of the OP's exchanges failed to go through, 2 were already refunded, another one is expected to be delivered within the given time frame. No funds were lost in the process, however, the OP is nervous and highly emotional.
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:16:39
**UPDATE**: As of now, was able to successfully access and move his funds. We'd appreciate if OP could confirm it himself when he's got a spare minute between collecting donations. Thanks in advance!
@_date: 2018-09-14 16:15:03
Since the establishment of Freewallet in 2016, we consider security as our priority. All our wallets have Multisig, 2FA and Pin code for login and transactions approval. It is highly unlikely for anyone to steal money from Freewallet.
And to answer your comment MoneroPanda, John hasn’t mentioned any coins being stolen due to a malicious activity by Freewallet. His largest case was resolved a month ago. The problem was that Ethereum Freewallet doesn’t support tokens. We did our best and solved his issue. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:57:46
216romeococo, you have just indicated that you sent TETHER to BITCOIN address.
For such type of a transaction, you are supposed to use a cross-currency exchange rather than a direct transfer.
We are unable to retrieve the coins other than BTC from a Segwit BTC address. Segwit address can be easily recognized: it starts with "3".
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:48:04
just to summarize: you've successfully withdrawn all funds from your Freewallet account (about 400 XMR).
Upon that, one transaction with 10 XMR dated as of May 28 had been in a pending status for a while. It was processed as well. 
@_date: 2018-08-13 13:40:32
Apart from the Bitrefill topup option, Freewallet supports the most popular cryptos (20+) as well as the inbuilt exchange option for them.
@_date: 2018-08-01 14:43:17
216romeococo, you sent your Tether transactions to a Segwit BTC address. It means your coins were sent to addresses with little or no chances of recovery. You can use Segwit BTC address only for sending BTC coins: please note that Segwit addresses start with "3". Please always double check your recipient address prior to sending a transaction. As of now, there are no official ways or tools to retrieve "wrong" coins from Segwit BTC addresses.

When a transaction is being broadcast to the network, it receives a hash first; although it has yet to be confirmed to be completed. In your case, this transaction received a hash, however, it didn't go through, so there's no record about it in the XMR blockchain. It means that the funds will be rolled back to your balance, if they haven't been already.
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:39:20
thanks for your offer, however, we don't charge anything for refunds. It's not a matter of a reward, plus we're also motivated to make sure you get back your funds ASAP: waiting for a long time hardly makes our users happy. 
As of now, we're expecting an update from Changelly and will follow up when we have more information. Thanks again, we'll keep you posted!
@_date: 2018-05-24 19:16:38

your funds are in your Freewallet account balance; they haven't been taken, used or moved. As you know, we're still waiting for your documentation to proceed with the user verification procedure. We kept our promise to speed up the procedure specially for you: as soon as you submitted the photos we requested, they were reviewed within less than an hour. Unfortunately, we had specifically asked you to send the unedited photos, while the ones you provided looked heavily photoshopped.

Again, as soon as we received your photos, we a) confirmed the fact, and b) got back to you as soon as they were reviewed by our security department. Should you have responded to our email with the original photos, you would have your case resolved by now.

Dear David, I am sorry for the inconveniences you're experiencing. We're trying to expedite the procedure but it's impossible without your collaboration. Please understand that we have to take all steps required by the verification process. 
We believe there are ways to receive proofs of transactions made through SS.
One way is to refer to the SS order.
Another option is to contact ShapeShift's support and include them in this thread of discussion by copying an email to their support desks' email address. This will work as a proof of your transactions as well.

actually, if a transaction is sent to a wrong network, but the receiving address is with Freewallet, the sender can contact us at info or via [the contact form on our website]( and request assistance. The funds will be available at a Freewallet address, from which he/she will be able to send it out.

BitcoinCash.org used the BCC abbreviation first, which we picked, and since we haven't got a BitConnect wallet yet, it stayed. 
As for your question, we don't have access to random addresses. Please review the conditions we posted: if a Bitcoin transaction was sent to a Freewallet Bitcoin Cash address, we'll be able to retrieve the funds, and vice versa. Moreover, this transaction would be seen on the alternate network as well.

**Vol-Tron**, ouch! We're not the only one 3rd party wallet on the market. Not engaging anyone to run towards us, but running away from us, that's a bit too hard :)

Do you get to know your doctor personally before you come in for a checkup? Do you have to dig up your taxi driver's family tree before starting your ride? It doesn't really matter if you know them or not; what matters is how professional they are and whether they're good at what they do. 


Should there be an force majeur of such a scale that it would prevent Freewallet from continuing operations, our emergency protocols will be applied. Since our users' funds aren't stored on hot wallets, but in the offline cold storage, their funds will be retrieved even in the worst-case scenario. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:26:50
Abbreviations can be tricky, that's true :) Freewallet is actually one of several custodial wallets on the market. There's a demand for our services, otherwise we wouldn't have been in business for 2 years already. Plus, we've recently introduced an option to import/export your private keys without losing the benefits of our cold storage technology, which should come handy.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:02:16
wow. You're posting accusations while we're [helping you resolve the issue with your transaction]( and updating you via different channels on the status of your case? So typical for a "notorious scam", don't you think so?
Freewallet has never stolen from their users, neither we ever had any intention to. On the contrary, we're working hard to make our apps a simple and convenient means for users to manage their coins. We're a live service operating with a very dynamic environment, so issues can come up. Learning about this or that issue from users and fixing them is how most software products work. Saying that we resolve issues only because of the public feedback is as logical as saying that the wind blows because the trees are rocking. 
It's true that people often come to share their concerns or dissatisfaction online, which is why the share of negative reviews is usually more than that of positive ones. However, we're responding to 100% of our user requests and help with each and every one of them. That's exactly why there's also a ton of positive reviews on our apps as well as a lot of thanks we receive from the users we've helped on email and in the in-app support chat.
We're now having a high load of support requests related to exchanges: unfortunately, there have been temporary issues on our exchange partner's side, which is why we're now working around the clock to make sure our users get their coins back. Your case won't be an exception: your Dash transaction will also be refunded to you, our support reps will walk you through on that. What makes us sad is that you believe it to be some kind of a foul plan against you and disregard the efforts our team is making to assist you.

Not exactly: you can send your Bitcoin Cash to a Bitcoin Cash smart address to exchange it for Bitcoin and the other way around. A direct transaction of one coin to another one's network will only get the funds stuck.
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:11:20
we're currently looking into it. In the meantime, the maintenance on the Steem wallet is over.
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:00:47
**studiord**, there should be a receiving address where you can send your BTC from your Freewallet address, just like any other blockchain transaction. We're also planning to release the feature that will allow exporting your wallets to PC or another service soon, it may be just what you need ;)
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:24:02
Freewallet [will be supporting BTG]( All our users who will be holding BTC in their wallet at the moment of the hard fork will receive the equivalent amount of BTG. 
We have successfully [distributed Bitcoin Cash]( after the hard fork in August, the process will be the same here.
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:28:30
our support team have already responded to your queries: your coins are right where they have been: in your wallet. Here's a recap, just in case:
Ardor moved to a dedicated blockchain in January 2018: it used to be on the NXT network, now it has its own chain. That's why our ARDR wallet was updated, and although your balance wasn't affected, you might need to take a couple of steps too refresh it in the app.
- If you're using the mobile app, please tap the "+" button, go to "Receive" and generate your new Ardor wallet address. After that, check out your balance.
- If you're using the the web version, click on ARDR, choose Receive and then click on the Generate New address button.
Our Steem wallet is currently under maintenance: we're adjusting it to the blockchain that hasn't been stable recently. During the maintenance, operations on the wallet are suspended. Why? To avoid issues with transactions. Instead of resolving cases with pending or failed transactions due to network issues, it's much more convenient to make sure our users can send and receive their Steem smoothly.
Regarding your GNO balance: not sure whether you're checking it in the Token Wallet or in the Multi Wallet. Exchanges with some tokens used to be temporarily unavailable, which might have affected the tokens displayed as available, but **not** your balance of them.

**aL_eX49**, have you contacted our support for more information? We'd have been able to shed some light on how your Freewallet works :)
The address displayed in your app is a so-called "hot wallet" used for receiving transactions. Keeping the funds there as well as storing your private keys locally could be a risk because if the access to your device is compromised, it would give a hacker an opportunity to steal your assets. That is why after you've received a transaction, the funds are moved to the cold storage. Whenever you need to make a transaction, your funds are transferred from the cold storage as well.
Your actual balance is displayed in your app; what you see on a blockchain explorer is most likely an intermediary transfer of funds in/out of the cold storage. Please note that you aren't charged with any fees for such transactions. Thanks to the cold storage technology, even if your phone gets lost or stolen, you can easily access your wallet using another device.

Cryptographic, sorry to hear about your experience!  
If we are referring to the Segwit address, it means we did conduct a research and, unfortunately, found out that this address is a Segwit one (it starts with "3").
It also does not mean that we waive the possibility to recover your original coins. Our developers are working to find the way to access this kind of addresses. However, there are no legit means here yet. 
The same issue could take place with any other hosted wallet: feel free to surf the Segwit-related cases reported by users. Still, the overwhelming part of similar transactions is beyong retrieval at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-10-28 13:50:01
Apologies for the inconvenience! We're currently looking into your case, our support reps will be updating you on the progress of it. 
Usually only a network fee is applied to outgoing transactions; it's dynamic and makes about 0.000X. That's definitely not a typical situation, we're currently researching it and going to fix ASAP. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:34:04
**aL_eX49**, see [the reply above]( please. We don't charge users for transactions in/out of the cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:31:26
**pbreed12**, was our support team able to help you retrieve the other transaction? Please let us know if you need any further information or assistance.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:50:44
Hey, glad you found us! If you need any info or assistance with our app, feel free to message our support in the in-app chat.
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:48:53
216romeococo, we have extensively researched your case, and unfortunately, we're unable to retrieve the coins sent cross-chain in your situation.
Your Tether transaction went to a Segwit BTC address (you can easily recognize one, Segwit addresses start with "3"). 
Normally, if your coins went to a regular BTC address, we would be able to retrieve them. However, Segwit addresses are different.
As of now, there are no official ways or tools to retrieve coins from Segwit addresses. 
You can find quite a number of people offering to recover your coins in such cases; however, they request sensitive information about your wallet and often demand bounties.
We will continue seeking ways to retrieve your coins. We do hope that Segwit developers will come up with a way to do it in the future. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:47:31
Reinhardt,  just to summarize: your transaction was successfully rolled back. 
@_date: 2018-02-28 06:32:51
the reason we helped you was because you asked for assistance. You might as well have [submitted a support ticket]( you'd have got the same information minus the fuss. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:40:21
**Poefsak**, wasn't your issue eventually resolved? Please message us if feel there's more we can do for you.
@_date: 2018-07-20 12:49:40


@_date: 2018-07-19 13:57:38
Cryptographic, it was not an exchange transaction, it was the transfer of BCH coins to BTC address being generated  in the Segwit format. Even if it would be a regular address, the whole retrieval process would be extremely difficult. 
@_date: 2018-07-20 07:35:22
To make this kind of exchange, you were supposed to choose Ethereun coin as the coin you wish to obtain and confirm this transaction. 
Please share your Freewallet user ID and we'll advise you on possible options. Thanks, looking forward to hearing from you!
UPD: We still have not heard back from you. Hope you managed to withdraw funds successfully. Please feel free to contact our support team if you need any clarification or assistance with planned transactions.
@_date: 2018-07-11 09:52:50














Unfortunately, as of now, there is no legit working scheme  to retrieve coins sent to this kind of addresses.  
@_date: 2018-07-10 08:45:10
Cryptographic, please provide your user ID so that we were able to look into your case in details. Thanks, looking forward to hearing from you! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:29:26
**MobTwo**, the "recipent" wallet address displayed in the app is a so-called "hot wallet" used for receiving transactions. Keeping the funds there as well as storing your private keys locally could be a risk because if the access to the device is compromised, it would give a hacker an opportunity to steal the assets stored there. That's the reason our users' assets are kept in the cold storage, not in "hot wallets". No users reported their funds lost or stolen by us because none were missing from the cold storage. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:07:01
Oh wow. All we did was a simple response to Flipflapper69's question when you started going all suspicious and throwing ultimatums right at us. 
I'd say we're sorry for the delay with the reply being busy with handling the BTG fork; however, if a person actually wants to hear an answer to their question, they don't usually shove it right in the face with a stopwatch ticking. 
Anyway, we'll be making an official statement regarding the coming 2x fork soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:42:52
sorry, but it looks like your article is based on outdated information: the fees you're describing aren't up-to-date. 
For example, there are 4 fee options for sending Bitcoin in Freewallet now.You can choose whether you pay a bit more for your BTC coins to be delivered quicker, or send coins with a lower fee and have them delivered at a later time. We're adjusting our BTC fee options to offer the optimum rates, it's a work in progress though.
You can always send us a message at info to learn more about the current fees we have first-hand, by the way :)

if there are anticipated network delays, we always notify our users about them. Don't forget to check your notifications in the app, please. You can also check our [Status Page](
PS: All Freewallet users have already received their XMO coins after the fork. [Download]( the Multi Wallet app or [log in online]( select XMO in the list of available coins and create a new XMO address. After that, check your XMO balance.
