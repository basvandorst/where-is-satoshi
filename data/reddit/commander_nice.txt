Thanks for sharing.
I recently got interested in the trading part he talks about because I saw that the price fluctuates up and down in what appears to be a pretty predictable manner over an hour. There are bigger fluctuations that occur over the course of a day and even bigger fluctuations over a month. It happens so often that it makes me think you could reap huge profits by using a trading bot to buy at each trough and sell at each crest.
I've learned it's more involved especially since exchanges will take their own cut. You need to predict where the price will crest and only buy when the next crest is above some fixed percentage of the current price.
I can't see myself investing long term because I have absolutely no idea where bitcoin is going and I'm skeptical of the hype around its use in Venezuela and India.

You can't learn about inflation in a simple 13 minute video like this one and especially one that seems to be from a libertarian perspective. It doesn't mention the federal reserve at all. And inflation is not taxation without representation. Seek different perspectives and theory before committing to any one.

What I mean by predictable is the price is generally smooth and polynomial-like over time. The same goes for the rate of change of the price. All I'm saying is there is *some* amount of predictability.

Yes, I realize I'm an plebeian when it comes to this stuff. Still fun to think about and reinvent the wheel.

I would tell you what I think, but I'd probably get downvoted.

People just like to throw money away.

I believe it's related to the fees. If there are no fees, you can sell at the same price you bought at and break even. If there are fees, you would be in the negative. For Bitstamp's fee of .25% per trade, you need to sell at 100.25% of what you bought at to break even.

I don't mess with bitcoin, but I like to watch the price move. I'm *really* curious to see how high it will go. IIRC it was 1k start of this year. In another year, could we expect it will reach 100k? Would this be one of the greatest bubbles in history?

Bitcoin has value the same way any other currency does - because people want it. Bitcoin in particular makes for a nice currency because it's secure against fraudulent transactions - you don't depend on a bank to not fudge the numbers. One reason people want it right now is because its value is rising and they assume it will continue to rise in the future, at which point they think they can sell for profit.
Key word is *think*. You don't know for sure what'll happen.
