I think in the end as global debt keeps mounting and the dollar declines governments will reset the currency and back it with gold, and probably tokenize it....they definitely wont choose to make early  bitcoin investors hyper powerful, so going back to currency redeemable in metal is about all they can do to maintain confidence..

This is the conclusion I came to as well....If shit hits the fan institutional money is not going to panic into crypto, they are going to panic into something far older, and hedge a little into crypto...
