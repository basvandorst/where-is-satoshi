I tried to transfer some BTC out of gdax last night and it's been stuck for 16 hours. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 13:10:11
Now you basically just copying my comments 
@_date: 2018-01-30 15:12:19
Doesn't make that guy's reply any less cringy through. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:36:54
Lol. Android only. You know you're a bad dev when you build for Android first
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:23:37
I love how many comments on that thread are making fun of the guy who "murdered" me for a satirical comment. Some people are smarter than others. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:28:30
!RemindMe 1 week 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:20:41
I guess it's time to start spacing the alerts out more
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:50:14
Yikes.  
Good luck my dude.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:30
nobody has any idea what they're talking about on this sub so all speculation is dumb imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:27:07
Congrats on being the 1000000 person to make this post. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:56:17
People watch this show on purpose?
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:53:46
What a useless comment
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:40
�� 
Sure thing dude. 
Nobody here has any clue what will happen.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:57:38
BTC currently on sale for only 16k. Buy it while it's cheap 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:38:49
.... I really hope this is a joke
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:09:08
...there is proof. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:23:44
If you can't do simple math like this, then crypto isn't for you. 
Honestly how old are you?
@_date: 2018-08-27 22:59:48
This sub is so bad 
@_date: 2014-09-10 13:36:31
Mark my words  a year from now ApplePay will be huge and mobile payments will be more ubiquitous as a result. Other smart phones have been trying to get this going for a while to no avail.  Now with apple in the game, it'll take off. 
@_date: 2015-01-01 15:45:41
Does this surprise anyone? Honest question
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:02:15
Super fucking annoying that coinbase isn't allowing me to buy during this dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:21:38
I'm also a noob. My strategy is going to be to pull anything over $1k out of Gdax to store in a wallet.  I'll leave a balance in gdax for day trading. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:28:12
4 years ago I emailed a coworker with 5000BTC "sell sell sell" after it dropped from $1000 to $400
I hope he didn't listen. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:38:35
Because I'm not trying to set them up for life. I might end up buying ETH too, but the point is just a small acount that has a potential of growing over time.  I'm not planning for his retirement or anything. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:39:48
This feels like an ad....
I'm so sick of these shill posts. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:48:29
...this seems like an ad
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:57:15
Last chance to buy below 5 figures. This is insane. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:13:46
I don't like that either. Be your own bank
@_date: 2017-11-20 23:09:55
And if I had wheels I'd be a wagon. 
Why do the mods allow shitposts like this? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:04:48
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:26:10
yeah because I have an extra $1800 laying around that I've been wondering what to do with....  
You guys are missing the point entirely.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:02:20
Don't you have to deposit USD into gdax before you can buy though? This seems like bad design. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:45:24
...how many times are people going to repost this?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:19:43
I hate storing fiat on gdax or coinbase. :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:29
Everything is buying BTC before 10k. ETH will be next as people push to $500
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:33:51
What are the fees? Coinbase is 10% for a bank account purchase.
I don't like the idea of using gdax as a bank. I don't store coins or USD in there so I personally don't want to wait 5 days to send money into gdax when I can purchase from coinbase instantly.  For example if a week ago I decided I wanted to get into Bitcoin and deposited $1000 into gdax I would only just be able to buy. But the price has gone from $8k to $10k in that time. Huge lost opportunity. 
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:59:10
I work in software security so I feel so late to this game. 4 years ago we had an intern trying to get my into bitcoin the first time it went over $1000 and I didn't think the hype was real. Now I am sitting here calculating how much I would have now if I would have invested then :/
don't want to be doing the same thing 4 years from now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:54:01
I wish I was rich enough to make a ton of money off this.
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:20:43
Yeah man I'm hoping 40 years from now I'll be glad that at least I was this "early" 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:51:34
When I was a kid my parents bought me $100 savings bonds every year that I got on my 18th birthday. Used it to buy a laptop for college. My wife is pregnant and every year I'm planning to buy $100 worth of Bitcoin for our kid to get on their 18th birthday. I wonder how much it'll be worth. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:58:56
I literally have no idea what you're talking about.  My best guess is I worded my comment poorly and you misinterpreted it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:06:15
Obviously....That's not the point though. I already have my own investment in Bitcoin.  
I'm talking about a separate account just for the kid to have all their own.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:41:19
Why do the mods not remove these shitposts talking about how much people have, or don't have, or would have had. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:55:04
People here are not very smart
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:07:59
Man you were so right.  You're so good at bitcoin.  I can't believe the price is still going down!!! /s
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:31:16
I was.. It dropped to about 650.  It's already gone back up 25% since I posted that.
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:12:24
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:50:01
dude wtf are you talking about?  Are you trolling or retarded? 
I meant that I was right before. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 04:45:43
I didn't buy shit.. I'm just saying, the more it went down it is going to rebound, and I was right.  Now had it dropped way lower (under 500), I might have bought some.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:40:14
I don't think I could possibly care any less about your wild speculation.
