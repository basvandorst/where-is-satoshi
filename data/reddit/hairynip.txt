he originally put his case number.  it wouldn't be impossible for someone to find out enough information about him to pose as him and talk to the CB people and get control of his stuff.  he also is advertising he has (will have) $40k in his CB account.

most people don't have issues.  it's like asking why people still use bank of america when they are caught doing shitty stuff frequently.

I use it still.  Mostly because of convenience: I have a large withdraw/deposit limit.  I'm waiting for verification on another site now (though I've been waiting for a while) because I don't want to be stuck with only one place though.  
I'm always cautious about stories like this because they often turn out to be some error on the user end coupled with slow customer service and nothing nefarious.
CB is just so simple to use, the fact is until someone else makes another website that is as simple as using CB, people will continue going there.

People use crypto all the time for actual purchasing.  I'm glad you are  so smart that you stay away from it except to come post in crypto subs about how smart you are for seeing how dumb everyone else is.

Only if you had the private keys for those coins prior to the split.  If the exchange you kept the coins on didn't give you private keys you are out of luck, unless the exchange decides to award you a BCH balance equivalent to your BTC balance in the future.

For real.  Is there some unwritten rule that phone screenshots can only be taken on low batteries?

No, whatever BTC you have now you'll always have.  
When the fork happens the BTC essentially gets copied and pasted as BCC.  The thing is you can only access the BCC copy of your coins if you have the private keys.  Coinbase doesn't give you private keys, so you have to transfer your BTC to something that gives you private keys (like a wallet).
After the fork, you take those private keys and use them on a wallet that works with BCC and you can then transfer your BCC wherever you want.
There are a few posts here that talk about potentially safe ways to do that.
BCC are basically 'free' coins for those with private keys to BTC.

Nothing will happen with your BTC if you leave it with Coinbase.  You won't however be able to claim any BCC because when you have BTC on Coinbase you don't actually have BTC (i.e., coins and their private keys) you hold IOUs from them for the amount of BTC you put there.

All BTC will be copied as BCC.
The coins within Coinbase still have private keys and will be copied as BCC.
The key issue is that Coinbase holds those private keys, not you.  So if you want to claim BCC you need to transfer your BTC from Coinbase to a place that gives you the private keys.  With those private keys you'll be able to claim the BCC.
You can only 'claim' BCC with the private keys of the BTC.
