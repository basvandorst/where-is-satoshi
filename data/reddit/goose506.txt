Just curious what he's worth? 
Why do I feel like 10k weekly for him is essentially us spending $1 on Bitcoin weekly. Sounds like pocket change.

How is this issue not gaining more traction in the media?
People say the U.S. can't fail, it's too big. I think NA as a whole could be in a world of hurt when the next depression hits. 
Look at Dubai's growth alone in the last 60 years. Then we have Detroit, once the richest city in the U.S. now looks like something out of the walking dead. 
I don't think we've seen even the surface scratched in what's going to be a national economical disaster. No one is safe, no matter how big. What goes up, just come down.

Absolute bullshit cover-up. No one who could breathe and walk would be dumb enough to not have multiple contingency plans just for this possibility.

People downvote but you're not wrong. 
Whether they're uneducated or malicious, downvotes to the facts are the real problem on this sub.

Sounds like something that shouldn't be legal in any stock/investment.. this sounds more like flat out gambling with money you don't have. What a beautiful system /s

These companies need to start a class action lawsuit and challenge the laws that protect the banks in Canada. 
I highly doubt "makinga noise" from the small personal account holders will make them blink. The courts need to rule and set precedence that they aren't invincible.
