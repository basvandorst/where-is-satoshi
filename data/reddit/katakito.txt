Swede here. To your question, nothing if you sell for no more than 19.999 SEK at a time. There will probably be an issue if you start to make wire transfers for large amounts to your Norwegian bank account though. But I guess you could open a bank account here to avoid that.

If they (the State) were providing services that are optimal for society they would not have to use the treat of/use of force to get people to use their services. Thus they are illegitimate. If they were interested in being legitimate they would offer people the option to sign a voluntary contract and therefore engage in a service provider/client relationship built on trust and quality of service. All people that are willing to use force to get what they want are doing so because they could never compete in a free market environment.

No. What you are worried about is the use of money. As money can be used as a tool to obtain the one and truly destructive force which is the lust for Power and Dominance. It's like blaming the hammer when you hit yourself on the finger while building a house.

In a way I agree. I feel that sometimes here in this subreddit the (although reasonable) advice to 'don't risk more than you are willing to lose' are being over used and applied in situations where the OP have clearly calculated that he won't for example starve to death if he makes 'a leap of faith'. Some people do have to take more risk than others to make it in this world. You actually take a huge risk just by getting on the road in a vehicle every day. Death is worse imo than losing money on a 'crash' of bitcoin. To be honset the chance of bitcoin succeeding is much greater than not (again imo).

'Pretty close to the mark', referring to a novel from where a name of geography is borrowed, is not an argument that strengthens your position in your first response.
