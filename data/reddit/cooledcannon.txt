Still, better than high schools claiming the credit. Especially the schools which I have been to and are verified by me to suck. If I do well and the school claims credit I will personally ensure its downfall(well, I probably wont go that far).

Smart move. If Bitcoin does well, Buffet pays a relatively large amount. If not, Buffet receives a relatively small amount.

Likely if they are in direct competition with you.

Your analogy is very different. You might have a leg to stand on if you didnt say it was always reliable.
The thing with investing is people mostly sell because they think it sucks and mostly buy because they think its good. If the trend is people are readily willing to sell something then you have an idea something might be up.

Wow that just seems totally retarded. iirc britain uses pounds, but i dont think that they are in the "Eurozone". It seems risky to put all your faith in a currency outside of your countries control... id have thought all of em have dual currencies. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:53:24
Wait do EU countries not have their own currencies? And yes, but diluted over multiple countries will have less of an effect per person.

This will just devalue the local currency even more.

it sort of is gambling, but on average doing what OP says will gain money. the question should is if you are willing to risk that much, and also the opportunity cost of not using the money elsewhere. putting all eggs in one basket isnt a good idea.
the more people that buy low, the less money you lose from selling low(and less money you gain from buying low). the more people that sell high, the less money you lose from buying high(and less money you gain from selling high). therefore, its a win-win situation, with OP using his money/resources in the market to gain extra money/resources, while people who panic buy/sell or people who who only buy or sell small amounts of BTC losing less money than they would otherwise. technically he is providing a service and not really gambling

As someone who would be affected indirectly by other peoples wealth, that would be 30M thats taxed rather than spent on the economy.

Its pretty obvious inflation sucks and its basically just another form of taxation. At least taxation has the excuse that government or "the public" gains money. Of course, inflation has that too, but people will have to admit inflation is taxation. 
Inflation is almost never good rofl. Probably never, i dont think anyone has enough debt to justify wanting inflation

Ideal currency is deflationary. But it costs money to make money deflate, so it doesnt really matter.

lol 
@_date: 2013-09-01 22:00:26
Actually, in a deflationary cycle, goods cost the same amount, and wages are the same too. Its just that money is more valuable. Nothing elses value decreases. With inflation, its the other way round, where money is less valuable. 
Edit: also, in a currency that continually inflates, its not just inflation that makes the currency lose value, its the expectation that it would lose value in the future that makes it lose value further. (bad money drives out good). It would be the other way round for deflation, where money is continually increasing in value. But unfortunately, that would never happen as deflation is very costly to maintain.

accidentally *WHAT* a word????? 
@_date: 2013-09-01 20:13:54
It is obvious. Everyone who owns money benefits from deflation, and gets harmed by inflation. The average person owns on average a positive amount of money, and even if you are in debt you gain when everyone else gains.
The reason why its a matter of debate is because inflation is an indirect form of tax but people dont realise that. Ofc cue explanations of how "inflation is good"

also, if everyone hoards, the value of BTC decreases, which reduces hoarding, which increases the value of BTC. think its called [negative feedback loop]( iirc
@_date: 2013-04-27 01:13:06
it would always work as long as there are enough people who panic buy/sell and not enough people who are doing the same as you. remember that you are not scamming them out of money, you are providing resources so that their stupidity would cost them less money. since there is probably going to be a significant number of panic buyers/sellers at least one person would continue making money doing this, but probably not as much as OP is making.

I interpreted the statement as a *good* thing
@_date: 2013-12-19 08:37:17


Doesnt matter. You can always buy it back later if the market drops low enough, if the intrinsic value is high enough.
