why has no one reposted the suicide hotline?

concerning that bitty price isn't rising, its staying low
@_date: 2014-02-22 10:16:21
so generally speaking bitcoins are pretty much useless to your average joe?
edit: that sounded terse and I didnt mean it to. I just mean really all the average joe gets out of it is the thought that he is sticking it to the dollar and the banks, right?

Don't you think the major thing to happen next if it is to be a success is the implementation by online giants like Amazon? Plus general simplification? At the moment you need to be well versed in computating. My old man couldn't buy a bitcoin nor learn it without serious tuition. It needs to be simpler to buy and sell and easy to use.

don't understand

So I wasn't the only one thinking the out of the limelight singer had put his remaining wealth in bitty.

How come that guy hasn't reposted the suicide hotline number? It got bitcoin onto reddits front page and featured in a ton of subreddits. I only have one bitty so I feel nothing bad, but this drop in price is worse than what happened a month ago. Just curious.

This was an orgy of sly-winking usery.
I always recall the guy on here who lost over a hundred coins, and he still seemed so chipper.

I can understand someone wanting to be self reliant and pay no tax... but what happens when they get chest pains? Just... die?

I've signed up to get a wallet. I am on the cusp of investing. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 21:38:45
Rational. My heart tells me it could increase exponentially. My brains says all the major rising has been done and it will now be slow burn.

I have grasped buying and moving into a wallet, blockchain. I have some kind of wallet file stored and backed up. What I assume I am reading on this thread is that folk who don't want to invest big then such a set up is fine, while people doing thousands really need tighter security?
This must sound so dumb to some of you, but I look here and see people talking about how your seed is your wallet, or how your wallet should be backed up each time you use them, generating private keys... 
I read often how bitcoin could explode into the mainstream in years to come. Now are we simply still in the early stages here or are we actually expecting your average joe to know what seeding his wallet means?

It went from cents to two hundred dollars- what can those two hundred dollars become in another 5 years?

Rather than stare at screens you should be out telling friends about the advantages of bitty
