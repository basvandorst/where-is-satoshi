The easy answer is the obvious one- bitcoin is something new that does not squarely fit into any of the pre-established constructs that the law is comfortable using, and over which complex structures have been architected.  American law, however, attempts to take long-held concepts and apply them to new problems in an effort to foster consistency of the law- i.e. don't change the law to adapt to new tech, but implement or interpret the law so it can effectuate the goal and intent of the law consistently against to the new tech. That being said, occasionally a new construct demands new law- this may be the case for bitcoin. Presently, Judges, regulators and courts are still trying to harmonize the concepts applied to other previously understood assets to Bitcoin- that's why we see such uneven results. What is bitcoin? It's Bitcoin. If the Courts and regulators can't figure out how to implement existing policies to Bitcoin in a workable way, eventually smart policymakers, with the critical assistance of the industry, will figure it out.

Would permit BTC as source of funds converted into USD to be used for EB-5 program funding. I don't believe anything in the comments suggests that USCIS or any other part of the US Government will start accepting BTC directly.

Lawyers specializing in "asset planning" try to do this but ultimately, even with bullet proof planning, there are tracks that lead you to the money, or sanctions for hiding it so it can't be found.
