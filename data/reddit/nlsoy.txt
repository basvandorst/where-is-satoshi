It’s also moderated that way. If you try to talk about Bitcoin on r/btc you’ll get referred to go to r/bitcoin instead. If you try and talk about Bitcoin Cash on r/bitcoin you’ll get banned. They REALLY don’t like each other.

I for one like that addition! It makes it easier to follow whether you’re talking about  BTC or BCH, since they both originated from the same stuff right? I like to think about it as “from Bitcoin came Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Core - both claim to be the original bitcoin and I have no idea who’s right”. However it’s really fascinating to see how both parties accommodate to expansion and mass adaptation!

My SO is 4’11” and she’s beautiful. I think 5’3” is an overestimate on how an average woman should be. All sizes are awesome ❤️

The absolute best time to buy bitcoin was in 2009. The second best time to buy bitcoin is now.

No offense but isn’t Ethereum also an altcoin?

Aww it’s leveling out already :(

THIS! I don’t really care at all what it’s called! I do however like the Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Cash implement! It makes it easier for us “outsiders” to differentiate one from the other!
