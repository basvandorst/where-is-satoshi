This is a ridiculous situation. Even if Nvidia isn't recommending this, some retailers are trying to restrict people from buying GPUs for mining. If the highest and best use of GPUs is for securing cryptocurrency networks, trying to mandate how they are sold is a strange exercise against the market. 
These are cards with memory and processors on them that have capabilities beyond calculating polygons and not only that, **they have been marketed as able to do non-gaming computations.**
Gamers have plenty of options. Less mining friendly cards are out there, and if they absolutely need the top end hardware they can pay the market price.

How does that entitle anyone to anything?

The guy died a couple months ago. Does the ponzi scheme persist?

They missed such an opportunity here. They could have opened a bitcoin-oil market and pegged their currency to bitcoin.  Hopefully the people of Venezuela will find themselves with some more effective leadership sooner than later.

What's a good Electrum node that doesn't log?

Which ones actually do?

I think it's pretty well known they are missing a few bitcoins :)

I think these "smart" fee calculating BTC clients might be causing unnecessary inflation of the fee market.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:51:10
Interestingly, the fee market is still inflated thanks to poorly implemented automatic fee-calculating clients.

That's a shitty rate for a ponzi scam.

Hold your bitcoin in your own secured, backed up wallet.

Gold generally doesn't have a record of its ownership history. Unless you want it to.

Buy, hold, hope the price goes up. If you can stand to lose some money, sure "invest" in eobot, and other scams. Maybe the lessons will be worth the money lost.
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:55:51
Do yourself a favor and don't try. You'll only lose your bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-09 06:19:08
It can. Depending on who's taking it.

Jesus christ this is a shitty meme post.  Doesn't even make sense.
Markets don't respond to "please."
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:38:57
Can maybe not upvote garbage posts? thanks
@_date: 2019-02-27 00:10:33
Thanks man
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:37:13
That's it, continue upvoting garbage. That's the way to being a legitimate discussion forum.
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:59:43
I don't know, I think it's just a culture of memeing idiots on reddit. That it's a public facing hub is only because options that should be better have failed the Bitcoin community.
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:02:35
Reddit is not a good forum for discussion without being surrounded by retarded memes.
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:29:55
When in doubt, throw it out.
@_date: 2018-04-04 03:13:12
They look ok but too faded and low contrast. And the highlight swoops on each can be deleted.

I used BTC at their restaurant and they didn't want to let me leave the restaurant until 1 confirmation. I even told them I wouldn't be leaving the premises I just had no reason to sit around for an indefinite amount of time in their restaurant. Thankfully a bitcoin block came along just after I finished my drink. &lt;facepalm&gt;
I hope their employees have had more experience with people using bitcoin since then.
@_date: 2018-04-13 22:50:23
Ouch. You'd think they'd be able to program their own software better so that they wouldn't need to cover that.
@_date: 2018-04-07 09:09:39
This is the dumbest post I've seen here, and there have been a lot of dumb posts.

They blew off the dust of an iPad but didn't grumble. Just mentioned they hadn't done one in a while.

He's a loudmouth idiot who gains notoriety from posts like this, so just ignore him.

The one I almost used in Vegas, the guy working nearby it told me to use the other one in the area. Apparently people were getting burned on that one.

It's a cascade effect. Do you really think BTC would go up $1000 in a half hour from a single trader? 
@_date: 2015-03-01 07:12:52
Storing? Good luck with your 2-D sci-fi boredom simulator but be honest, it's doomed to fail.
GJ on scamming some Canadian idiot out of their hard earned canuck-bucks though.

This software is very promising for a functional, decentralized, and **blockchain based** forum. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 23:04:58
Once a single triggering short got liquidated, it had to buy some BTC to cover the loan. Then that liquidated another short, and another, and another. Cascade.

Guess steemit has them on the backfoot?
