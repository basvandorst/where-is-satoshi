Fiat is certainly backed up by something - it's backed up by all of the businesses that have to pay taxes in fiat. Since businesses and people have to pay taxes, they shrug and just do their business in fiat. Those businesses and the assets that they own form the backing for the currency.
The USG isn't on the gold standard, but it's on the Boeing-Facebook-Intel-Applied Materials-Raytheon-US Steel-etc standard.
Crypto does not have that same backing, which is why it is so volatile.

Also, note that a professor can be a flagrantly shitty teacher and still be very good at their actual field of study.
I had a Databases professor who was *awful*. Unclear lectures, fumbled at basic questions, the works. I looked him up, and it turns out that he's well-respected in his field. He just doesn't give half of a flying shit about teaching undergrads about CouchDB.

They're just fine as indicators over the course of quarters or years. The daily fluctuations are like reading goat entrails, though.

In 500 years? Absolutely not.
We don't remember businessmen unless they spend 5.8 metric shittons of money on philanthropy, and Jobs contributed $dick in that regard.

Smoking is hazardous to your health because it contains tar.
Hot air is just hot air. If it were carcinogenic, everyone in Phoenix would be giant tumors.
Speaking of which, has anyone made sure that the people in Phoenix haven't transformed into giant tumors?

It's a lot cheaper to get scammed out of your rune armor than it is to lose your life savings.

All crypto investors should be required to play Runescape for a few years.

Sure, let's go with this. The world is the Wild West. There's justice, but it's of the frontier kind; the winners are usually who has the sheriff's ear and who is able to assemble a posse to go after their enemies. Sometimes, justice is served, and the posse hangs the right guy. Sometimes, they lynch the honest cowboy instead of Old Man Clanton. Most people are grudgingly okay with this because they accept that the world isn't perfect and flawed justice is still better than no justice at all.
Bitcoin is Mad Max. There are no rules, no accountability, and if you end up hanging from the ceiling with your blood type tattooed on your back, it's your fault.
The question for the crypto-libertarians: Are you tough and smart enough to be the fat dude in the plexiglass armor, or are you one of the poor fucks hanging out at the bottom of the occasional waterfall?

The promise is of *stability*, not that a dollar will maintain its value.
If the Fed says that they're aiming for 2% inflation, the US government adopts fiscal policy to reflect this, and the Fed adopts the appropriate monetary policy for this, then everyone is happy despite the dollar [halving in value every 35 years]( It's *stable*, and you can, say, set your interest rate at 3.5% for a certain loan category and be confident that you'll make a profit.
That confidence in future value is why people buy 30-year bonds.

As long as you're confident in its future value, it has a clear present value.
A dollar is just a unit. It doesn't matter whether a candy bar is $1 or $2 or $20 or $200. As long as that increase is predictable, it's not a big deal. The only casualties of inflation are a) people who hold dollars for long periods of time, for whatever godforsaken reason and b) people who have to listen to grandparents complain about how expensive everything is.
No one HODLs dollars. It's a tool for exchange - nothing more, nothing less. You use it to buy the things you need, and the rest goes into mutual funds, real estate, an entrepreneurial venture that your buddy Derek is setting up, Bitcoin, whatever you think is going to increase in value. These things (hopefully) have a positive rate of return that's above the rate of inflation, and you become wealthier even though the value of the dollar is decreasing.
Note that exponential decay is a lot less scary when you have exponential growth on your side. Long-term, your assets should be growing exponentially.
