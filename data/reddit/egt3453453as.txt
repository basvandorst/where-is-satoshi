It's not too far off but I'd say maybe 250k or possibly even less.. somewhere between 150k and 250k. I probably have at least 3 or 4 blockchain.info accounts that I don't use anymore (different phones with the app installed and old accounts I nolonger use). Take a look at these graphs of the number of keys in the blockchain of varying values;  and also the wealth is highly concentrated in 40k keys that probably are owned by less than 20k people  and even more concentrated amongst the largest 10k keys - which again probably belong to a lot less individuals.

I'd recommend kraken.com - it's also us based and has a bank account in san francisco. In order to trade there you need to register with an address that is in one of the US states that have no money transmitter laws (montana, south carolina or new mexico) - or outside the US. You can trade up to $2000/day without verifying your address ;)

It might not be easy and they would need to figure out some way to make something happen slowly so that it would be impossible to role back without many people losing out.
The top 3 mining pools could also collude to stop processing of transactions.. obviously eventually people would stop using them but this might take some time.. with a well coordinated attack I think it could be pretty thoroughly discredited before anyone had time to undo the damage.
You could leverage the mining pools to somehow create a crisis and then get the development team to do an emergency update to respond to it that only makes things worse.. The reality is that bitcoin is controlled by a very small number of people (like &lt;20) - they can't do anything they want, but if they are sneaky enough then there are probably ways they could burn bitcoin to the ground. Assuming a state actor they could combine technical problems with bitcoin with legislative attacks on the exchanges as well as more DDOS attacks and perhaps some coordinated selling of BTC to lower the price and create more panic. Then finish it off in the press with a round of negative articles.
