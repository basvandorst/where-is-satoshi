Have any of you seen "The Money Masters" on YouTube?
I just started watching it, but have heard wonderful reviews. Also on the Federal Reserve. Would love to hear some thoughts if you've seen it!

Thanks so much for the great reply. As far as creating a "simple PIN or password" that further protects the paper, how exactly would I go about doing that? The paper wallets I've seen have the public and private keys clearly printed on them.

Thanks so much. Determining what is and what is not the user's "fault" to me at least is a very murky idea.
What if I am just a regular guy who doesn't take cryptographic precautions to secure my computer (but does actively run an anti-virus program to detect intruders), and somehow, without my knowledge, the coins are taken? Would I be reimbursed then?

If most things are transacted using bitcoin, wouldn't that make taxation in fiat more difficult to enforce? Said another way, if I live entirely on bitcoin, and have no fiat tracks, how can the government make me pay taxes since they would likely have no records of my finances?

Thank you for the wonderfully thoughtful post.
I know many of you don't necessary care for J. M. Keynes, but I recommend his "Economic Possibilities for Our Grandchildren" (1930), in which he makes many of the same predictions. Most of these haven't necessarily come true -- probably because of his faulty assumptions about human nature and our aversion to too much leisure time -- but perhaps bitcoin and it's deflationary tendencies are the missing link in his argument. Anyway, here is a taste of the essay:
"There are changes in other spheres too which we must expect to come. When the accumulation of wealth is no longer of high social importance, there will be great changes in the code of morals. We shall be able to rid ourselves of many of the pseudo-moral principles which have hag-ridden us for two hundred years, by which we have exalted some of the most distasteful of human qualities into the position of the highest virtues."
Have a restful evening, and best of luck capitalizing on the price dip,

Will Circle charge 1% to purchase BTC?
If I'm not mistaken, I've heard they are implementing instantaneous BTC acquisition, which is a huge improvement.
But yes, as QwertyCore nicely laid out, until merchants give us more than 1% off (or whatever the BTC acquisition fee becomes in the future), an incentive does not exist for the consumer.

Is this BIP38 that you are referring to?

I'll be sure to look at that guide. So thanks for that! And I'm probably not ready for the Trezor yet, but that's a wonderful recommendation as well. Thanks.

Okay, I would tend to agree. These are all good points. I would have every intention as well to pay my taxes; I was just saying that in a world that is mostly using bitcoin, it could be hard for the governments to enforce taxation.
With that said, however, truthfully none of us have any idea what a world that primarily uses bitcoin will look like. Thus, making predictions about the consequences is only conjecture. Still fun to do, but our predictions are likely not accounting for a few things.

At this point, you're probably right. I'm not sure what her thinking would be in converting back to USD.
But I'd say the bigger problem still remains, in that a new user of this supposedly "instantaneous currency" was forced to wait 2 weeks to get her laptop.
I'm hugely long bitcoin, although it's fairly salient that the necessary infrastructure is not in place YET. As many have said, let's all be on the lookout for this "user-interface moment."
I'd like to think that we solve some of these fundamental "problems" then.
@_date: 2014-07-27 16:45:31
Yes, nicely elocuted. I completely agree. In theorizing and philosophizing on the future, we often forget the transition stage.
I am certainly not an anarchist myself, but for those who are, your above assertions are especially relevant -- namely: perhaps a new world without government is a wonderful place (I'm not so sure myself), but it is much more germane to discuss the steps that would be needed to ultimately achieve such a state, rather than merely how that state is superior to the existing one.

smashT - just read through all FAQs, terrific stuff. Thanks a bunch.

Just looked at Circle's website and am excited to see that they will not charge fees to convert USD to BTC. Going to be difficult for Coinbase to compete with a free service I'd say.
I'd equate it to an early-internet company charging for the ability to use a search engine, send an email, or use a browser.
Perhaps in '93 there was a market for paid internet-use; however, that's fairly unthinkable today.
Hopefully we're moving in this direction shortly.
