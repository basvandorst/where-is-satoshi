Very cool. Thoughts on allowing the hotspot to be used to make payments to other people for free \(all LN network traffic will be allowed\)? I guess it'll be hard to block anyway since you'll have to allow payments to yourself.

They didn’t lose data. They just did not dispose of an old backup correctly. I guarantee they still have all of the data.
This is a data leak fail, not a data loss fail.

Yup. The fact that bitcoin can completely settle in an hour, and the trust that that can bring is a big innovation, compared to other transfer methods. Funds reaching a bank account instantly isn’t equivalent.
Unfortunately the differences in settlement make it v hard to use bank accounts to trade directly.

Decentralized fiat to crypto is risky as you could be receiving stolen money, have transfers reversed, etc. There's a trust mismatch between crypto and the banking system.

This /may/, and I stress may, be true in percentage terms (risk vs reward) on investment $s, but the size of the pie is much bigger, so the total $ profits are bigger with a higher coin price. 
This is also leaving aside the short term effects of price vs difficulty as there is a lag.

Sure. I’m just trying to tell others that it isn’t a fight club, erase all the records situation.
I’m very much looking forward to the privacy improvements that LN will bring.

People will believe anything.

True hodlers would never give their coins up for a depreciating car.

They were supposed to destroy the tapes, so it’s more like they didn’t dispose of the records properly. 
For contrast, bitcoin transactions will be on thousands of nodes forever. At least users know this from the start though.
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:59:03
I think it’d probably be the same on r/btc. Both are basically cesspools at this point.
@_date: 2018-06-20 20:41:33
Exactly this. Hash rate follows price, other than the effect of newer, more efficient, mining equipment being produced, which will also affect the hash rate. The latter is what is happening now.

No. $/byte is the only thing that matters as it what you are competing against when a miner decides to place your transaction in a block. They will take the transactions with the highest $/byte figure and leave the rest.
Obviously users care about $/transactions, and probably shouldn’t care about $/byte, but $/byte is what decides whether your transaction is in a block.
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:55:18
I agree with you there, but whether you talk in $/byte, or $/transaction doesn’t change the story. They are essentially equivalent.
The problem is that the parent compares two different units.
@_date: 2018-06-05 06:05:38
So you’re arguing uto multiply on both sides, leaving the comparison essentially intact...
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:01:23
If you look at my argument, I am not claiming that BTC is cheaper than BTC. I’m also not saying that miners are the issue - the way bitcoin works in practice is there is a market for $/byte, and the highest fee per byte almost always wins, so that’s the only way to really compare costs.

Most lightning software won’t let you create a large channel without some configuration changes. This is to prevent people from losing too much money if there happen to be some bugs and invalid states are submitted. This has nothing to do with any fundamental limitations in lightning, it’s iust cautionary.
This means that it’s currently hard to route big payments between two nodes. As channels become large this won’t be as much of a problem. In addition, atomic multi path payments are in the works, which mean you won’t need to route a full payment along a single path.

You’re welcome to convert both to USD instead. Whatever you do you need a common unit. You’re agreeing with me. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:15:26
This is why you don’t trade. The taxes would have been reasonable if they didn’t. If you held until the end you’d have more than $750K at the end as you’d only pay the 25% once
@_date: 2018-06-05 05:25:24
When you compare something you need to convert to equivalent units. If you want to convert the BCH sats to BTC sats first it would be fine, but until then you are essentially  comparing two different units.
Put another way, would you directly compare an lap times for an American runner per mile to a Canadian’s time per km? No, you would convert them to a common unit.
@_date: 2018-06-05 03:21:25
Before I start, I support bitcoin and small blocks.
That said, it’s not really true because the units are not equivalent. A bitcoin satoshi cannot be compared directly with a cash satoshi. One is worth almost 7 times as much as the other, so the true cost of the bitcoin transaction is more like 7x the BCH transaction (whether denominated in gold, USD, chicken nuggets, whatever). Fees have come down a lot but it’s hard to compete cost wise with a chain that is barely used.

Relocating hash power does not cause the price to dump. Price causes hash not the other way around.
The only reason why a split in BCH would cause a dump in cryptocurrencies is that things just don't feel stable - many in the market might feel like there will be endless splits, no consolidation around something the market can use effectively, and greater increases in complexity.
My thinking around why there's been a dump is that people are throwing their hands up in an already beaten down market, and maybe the BCH split is just news that make them re-evaluate the general state of the world. Nobody really knows.
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:26:01
Interesting. I had no idea, as I thought you’d still only need one signature.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:06:32
Yep, I agree that most transactions are exchange related. Most will be to and from end user wallets though, so it'll be interesting to see if sidechains can help there.

Baby don't hurt me.

I think this is essentially the end game for most users. 
Either that or lots of extra software controls around the money, e.g. they hold part of a multi sig key for a smart contract which locks up most of their money unless they call up their bank to sign the other half of the key. We're still in the very early days of this - many new techniques will be required.
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:43:45
No need to be like that. What writeawill is saying is true, in that knowing some of the characters cuts down the search space of a brute force crack. It doesn’t matter that any difference peturbs the result. The point is that you don’t have to make as many guesses.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:50:55
During true market crashes, correlations go to 1.

You would lose money if you are using FIFO accounting, and you bought your first one at $1000, then bought a second at $8000, then sell one at $8500. You would owe taxes on $7500 of gain since the first one is the one that is considered sold. At a tax rate of 20% you would have a net loss of $1000 even though your trade made $500.
The only other thing worth noting is that you would have had to pay that tax eventually. The worst situation would be if you later sold the other one for a big loss in a different tax year.
If you don’t own any and then buy one and sell it for a gain, you would be fine. You only pay taxes on the net gain.

Yeah, I don’t get it. If they’re worried about generating unspendable inputs due to small balances and high fees, they could always send the amounts to the same address. Reuse isn’t great for privacy but it’s better than burning it, and you could have a completely separate address for this purpose.
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:20:35
Key words are “keep fees low”. Obviously they are low now but once you hit full blocks, fees sky rocket as often the demand is not elastic. Avoiding these peaks requires planning for efficient use now.
@_date: 2018-04-30 21:24:13
How does remove the need for punishment? I get why it’s simpler, but if feels like users broadcasting old channel state should still have some level of punishment (more than losing their tx fees). Otherwise isn’t there an incentive to send old channel state and hope for the best, assuming fees are low?
@_date: 2018-04-30 21:27:02
Great! Thank you. That makes a lot of sense.
@_date: 2018-04-30 17:56:43
I really like that this deals with the toxic state problem. It’s great that the full series of updates won’t be required. Unfortunately I don’t understand how you can truly invalidate states without pushing something to the chain. How will the chain know which state is valid without some secondary transaction by the other party to prove that isn’t the latest?
