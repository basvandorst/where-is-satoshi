Why is this comment rated so high? The OPs has brought up a real issue, this is not good for Bitcoin (BTC) :( hopefully SegWit and Lighting fixes this, but right now the civil war which many including I thought was over, is far from over, and far from won.

Erik Voorhees is a great business man and is pro bitcoin and pro cryptocurrency. He was a former Bitcoin maximalist, but no longer. He was the most centrist person during the scaling debate. ShapeShift is also an awesome service, I'll be getting a keep key.

This guy is right, it's like tensing up before you take a punch, it hurts less but also your insides are tighter together so they don't move around as much on impact.

We're still in the lunatic fringe phase ��

If you sell now you are basically throwing hundreds of thousands of dollars down the drain. I can't think of a worst situation, once it's above a million a decade or so from now. How do you think we will be buying things in the future? You will be able to buy your house in Bitcoin, your car in Bitcoin, coffee with Litecoin, kids school with Dash. There is really no reason to sell Bitcoin, in fact... you will be able to loan out your Bitcoin and gain interest on it. Always think... how can I make my money work for me? Instead of Get me Rich quick! So I can buy my lambo, then go into debt.

I keep telling people, if it's not 1 million don't even consider selling... Even then don't consider selling

Attack? When someone sells their own assets and buys others?

Then most people in the world are socialists and authoritarian by that stupid measure.

Never keep Bitcoins on an exchange :( use hardware wallets... any updates from their support?

Well technically he is right, most will fail and go to 0 or close to it. You could lump in any coin that is not in the top 100 into that category, and there are about 1400 coins.

r/bitcoin has gone insane, Wences Casares and Erik Voorhees were preaching Bitcoin before most of you even heard about it. These guys created businesses to promote Bitcoin and help gain mass adoption. And you guys lump em in with the likes of Jamie Dimon? r/bitcoin has turned into the very thing holding Bitcoin back :(

Don't sell, Bitcoin is a long Hold... Just buy and only think about selling 10 years from now.
