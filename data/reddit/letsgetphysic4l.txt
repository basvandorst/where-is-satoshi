Oh  well yeah of course. It’s still early. Crypto as a whole. But it is growing and I mean that’s better than nothing. It could be faster than PayPal one day 
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:11:10
All the things you mentioned except two are literally just basic advice for investing overall. Not just Bitcoin ��. Also you forgot to spread out portfolio.  I mean you really think it’s smart to have that much in one SINGLE coin. Not really. But again. Idk your finance but 50% is a lot for anyone rich or poor. But cost averaging is a lot smarter. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:58:24
Orrrr don’t. If you invest half of your income that’s probably one of the dumbest things you could do. I’m just sayin. They say 5-10 percent. But it’s your money do what you please. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 19:01:38
Maybe. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:20:52
It’s never too late. But definitely do research. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:27:14
You must be blind. You can now buy KFC chicken in Canada. Bitcoin Bucket. Isn’t that all you need? 
No but now more and more places are accepting it as a form of payment 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:10:05
It slipped 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:50:24
Yup rip to my losses. I really credit myself on only being scammed once in my life but like the website is exactly the same. And when I got the email saying it wasn’t the right one I wasn’t even mad. It was so much similar I couldn’t be upset by it
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:54:50
That’s a long time from now 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:43:34
Then there it’s 17$ you can usually calculate it before you send it
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:35:06
Yes. Fees also are from miners 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:18:22
Yeah there’s other cryptos that are less. If your using Coinbase with 100$ you can buy nearly a whole Litecoin if you believe in the technology. Or if you spend more and buy a whole coin you’ll actually see your money go up or down by a whole dollar amount. Or ETH. or an alt coin is an option 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:00:06
The fee itself? It’s all on how much you transfer. Bitcoin is a lot tho in comparison to others. It’ll tell you though 
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:12:42
Ahh interesting 
@_date: 2018-01-28 07:10:20
Thing is though. 100$ in BTC isn’t much. It’ll cost ab 15$ to transfer it to a different wallet. Might as well keep it on the exchange site you use. I mean you could but it’s a rich mans game. could invest in other coins instead. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 18:03:51
Well if you were to use the easiest way which would be through Coinbase. You’d need proof of identity. So There parents. And it just seems like a lot of work for 10$ of BTC 
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:07:15
Sorry for irrelevant. But what is being effected in non crypto world with this shutdown. I can’t find a link or a explanation sorry. Lol 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:48:19
Why not on feb 27? 
@_date: 2018-01-24 14:24:59
Shoots. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:21:11
Bought some LTC at 340 ����
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:47:36
Yes. Wallet to wallet always a fee
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:33:09
Long as you didn’t buy too much you good. I knew what I could spend and lose and well it’s kidna happening. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 17:44:47
Sounds right 
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:40:45
Ayeee was this yesterday. Nice ���� 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:30:28
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:20:37
Ok. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:28:44
Ok but wat did you ante up
@_date: 2018-01-14 02:07:22
What you gotta buy originally? Certain amount?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:25:03
Shoulda just waited till green 
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:46:36
Well crypto isn’t supposed to overtake like visas. More like digital cash. Just a picture of an QR code and ya done. No getting out cash. Making change. Would speed up things. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:29:12
Went to ShapeShift.com. Once tryna day trade. Woulda been up too. Rip. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 23:48:20
 No
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:24:07
True chainz 
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:23:24
Ehhhh 
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:22:15
Btc is for the rich 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:46:13
But if it ranks which is a possibility then you don’t have 5k to spend on goods and services in years to come. Also there’s always a rainy day. Might not have enough if the price drops. Goodluck with your decision 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:18:30
I meant that for if your buying like it takes about 7 day if you use a bank acc obviously now longer. If your selling it might be delayed now with all the traffic but again it’s locked in no matter what the currency does 
Since you’re using BTC it’ll take some time 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:56:09
Welcome. Just don’t take risks since it’s crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:16:38
Wait 7 days for it to show up maybe
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:21:02
It takes 7 days no matter what. There’s a graph on Coinbase I think but now it’ll take longer obviously but it’s locked in keep that in mind. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:05:40
Most do require 18. Try Coinbase.com. It’s 18+ you’ll need something like a drivers license. Your debit card might decline crypto currency purchases. Mine did. So you’ll need to link a bank account which requires a check book. Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:52:28
Spread the portfolio. And only spend what you’re willing to lose. Like 10% is smart 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:04:16
It’s locked in. Whatever you sell at is what happeneds. If u buy a coin let’s stay at 100$ and seven days later when your money comes in and it went up 10% then you have 110. If u sell at 100 and then an hour later it’s 110 you sold for 100 even if the transaction didn’t hit the bank yet. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 04:37:40
Nope never 
@_date: 2018-05-16 03:09:37
Ur cool 
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:40:08
U mean your investing. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:05
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:56:02
Why do you type like that 
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:52:04
Wrong sub 
@_date: 2018-02-12 00:24:19
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:19:24
Uh right 
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:22:54
Gotcha. I just don’t think this the End. 
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:11:21
It’s more than likely a scam. As far as I know you don’t get a text. You get an email. 
Not to scare you but it could be a phishing link where your ip is now known. Again not trying to scare you but probably a scam of some sort 
@_date: 2018-02-14 04:09:23
CrytpoNick! 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:12:43
Crazy uh
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:15:14
It did this two days ago then dropped hard right after    
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:56:56
Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:23:54
Nice. ����
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:14:08
Cmon this is basic investing animal terms. Minus a whale. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:18:45
How tf you get a Scammed selling coins? Buying coins is one thing but selling... 
this seems legit. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:25:16
Optimistic! And no problem. Cheers 
@_date: 2018-02-17 21:03:21
Looks legit 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:16:41
But was it MSRP
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:56:11
There is a Coinbase sub. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 16:57:54
Chill on the shill 
@_date: 2018-02-19 17:51:52
Why. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:19:58
Lmao I’m well aware but it going up 10% doesn’t mean it’s stabilized. Yea for 24hours but based on the past month it’ll keep going down every couple of days it’ll rise back. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:16:26
Same lol
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:15:32
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:06:35
No u can buy portions of coins to store. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:11:11
No (u don’t have to own a full coin ) u can buy portions
