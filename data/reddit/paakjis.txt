Can someone explain the drama for newbie? 
@_date: 2014-06-14 05:59:09
can you explain ? I read on other threads that 51% is bad. but why.?
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:54:36
I had a thought yesterday. You know a lot of daily transactions are made to buy illigal shit. And these people who sell items, need to split the coins and scramble it. So its much harder to trace. So maybe they do it at the same time , so it would be even harder to trace.

Its like when people buy number plates for cars because they start with AA
@_date: 2017-01-25 16:14:12
Is this why the network gets spammed ? They flud it with transactions and get payed more for mining ?
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:48:30
When the price started droping , 2 days ago. I cought the moment it did. Wanted to know whats going on. So I checked new posts here. One guy was asking whats going and should he dump ? The price still was around 870$. The first comment said "No, there is decent support at 900$". I think we should just stop listening to people on intetnet. Just think for your self.
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:46:33
I payed 30¢ for 60€ transaction. It was at least 4 h. This is bad.
What I understand miners update the transactions , but with time it gets harder for to mine ? So that means it gets harder and longer for miners to complete transaction ? Or im wrong and those are 2 different things ?
@_date: 2017-01-06 20:00:23
I have had like 10. And 3 of them took some time. Once it was when I showed my friend how easy it was. And the feels I got when it didnt go trough. 
What do you think it was ? Am I right about my previous statment about mining? Do they have some VPN detection / untrusted sources? ( I'm only asking because I'm from Latvia and my mobile network "LMT" bought some German IP's and for some time now I'm getting German Netflix. Good stuff. And when using google , it always asks if im not a robot. Mbe its something to do with that.)

Im starting to lose trust in Bitcoin. It needs to change. 
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:23:23
One Bitcoin is worth now about 900$ ( was 1200$ few days ago). Back then it was worth like 0.01$. Op found old hard drive where he had more that 1000 Bitcoins. Its only history , so it might be all gone now. Hes checking now if hes a millionaire or slumdog.
@_date: 2017-08-22 09:17:44
Ohhh, had to read it 3 times to get it. Was stuck on why would you sell on low and buy on high. But makes sence if it will continiue to drop/rise.
@_date: 2017-08-07 10:25:03
I dont think you have to look at it as Matrix universe. Its just 2 guys talking. And how I see it, if Bitcoin is worth millions, then people have moved away from fiat. And you wont have to sell, because you can spend Bitcoin everywhere.
I hope I didn't wooosh this one.

I will give you 0.0000000001 BTC for everything you have.

I guess if a years highest price didn't pass last years highest price, it picked the lowest price for that year.

Soon they will start mining gold in space. Gold will be worthless in like 200 years. RemindMe! 200 years

Ah shit. At least I helped someone to understand the jokes.

Is it posible to ban this guy ? He reposted the top comment. It must be a bot. What are the rules for this ?
@_date: 2017-01-06 17:53:58
Looks like it took 11h. I stoped checking after 4h.
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:35:39
Me and my friends from office were talking about bitcoin. Because I have some I was explaining them how it works. I said when shit goes down in economy then bitcoin will be valued more than gold. But they asked if shit goes real bad and nobody has internet. How will it work then ? I didnt know what to answer, I know there is a blockchain (wallets), that needs to be updated all the time. And it does require network. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:14:10
I dont remember the thought process exactly. But without knowing Bitcoin wont work without network I did see that in future , when 'shit goes down' , bitcoin could be more valuable than gold, because gold is also a metal and it also reacts with chemicals. ( Might also be a fool also)
P.S. Future without internet is not some "apocalyptic scenario".
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:15:33
So its not like the Bitcoin Cash split ? I will not get "S2X" coin in my bitrex ?

Price reaching top again. Time for it to drop. Lets make some drama.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:17:28
Where did you read that it was going on for months ?
@_date: 2017-09-08 08:36:14
Ozark. Its on Netflix. Very good, reminds me a bit of Breaking Bad, but with this guy.
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:12:28
Yeah here in Latvia they busted a bank. It had lot of foreigner. Allegedly they had ties with Russia and North Korea. 
2 weeks after the news, they closed down. And now all banks are under close watch. 
I bet Malta is smarter about hiding their money. Thats why they still can afford to do it.
@_date: 2018-03-12 09:10:02
I heard this a lot. But I really like his show. I watch the full episodes.
I don't see anything annoying, maybe people just don't like English accent or something.

Watched the trailer, looks good. Sucks that is got canceled and these shows like Walking Dead are still on air. First few seasons were alright, but now its just so boring.
