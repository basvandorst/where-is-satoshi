The rebirth of a global unregulated deflationary currency (post great depression) is merely a natural response to the widespread use of global fiat currencies. The technological benefits of the blockchain is a catalyst for mainstream acceptance as a store of value. It is clear that both deflationary currencies and inflationary currencies will coexist in some sort of symbiotic state.

There's plenty of room for both private/public centralized banks and decentralized public ledgers with privately held no safety net keys. We may even see private companies who's sole purpose is to insure assets on certain chains. There may even be chains that can allow 100% anonymous value transfer. It's a big universe ladies and gentlemen.

Sorry. I fail to see how any entity can stop the propagation of information whether it be intellectual property like music/movies or the bitcoin public ledger. Distributed networks will forever bypass centralized control. Ultimately, both approaches will exist as there are both advantages and disadvantages to each.

So in this instance, the value of BTC will change in relation to the progress of reaching consensus. I never thought about one chain consuming another, I guess that makes this a zero sum game.

Interesting. I would think lower volume would increase volatility. Correct me if I'm wrong, but if the non-fee trading volume was inflating volume artificially, it would stand to reason that the true volume was much lower and thus more volatile? Thanks again for the explanation!
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:28:23
Can someone more knowledgeable please explain to me how a lack of exchange fees can distort the markets beyond simply volume numbers. I'm having trouble understanding the implications and would greatly appreciate an explanation!

Why not just have two different versions? One chain with a small blocksize, and another with a massive one. Seems like two different coins would appease both sides of the debate.

In a world where everything is a ponzi scheme, bitcoin is its final form.

It has not decoupled yet imo, however, you are 100% correct. It is only a matter of time before a major financial scandal rocks fiat to the core and we will get more diverse currency usage in the mainstream. That being said, it will take a super-massive event to shake USD from the global reserve position.

The inflation measurements are dubious at best. The bean counters have no idea how to deal with things like tuition: 
"One of the most difficult problems for the CPI is to accurately quantify changes in the quality of an item and to factor these quality changes out of the item's price movements. If an item's characteristics change, a quality improvement (such as increased instructional time) or deterioration may have occurred. In addition, because quality change often accompanies price change, when the price of an item changes significantly, BLS field staff will ask the respondent to identify a cause. " 
Skyrocketing costs of education and healthcare are a direct result of runaway inflation. You can only keep a thumb on the scales for so long.

It is definitely interesting to watch and I wonder if they were actually seized or not. If so, what service would they use to exchange to USD? I would imagine this is the kind of uncertainty leads to the kind of volatility that day traders love.
