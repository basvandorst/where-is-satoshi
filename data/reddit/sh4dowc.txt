No, I was getting the game instantly before the lightning network.

I think it was because I've paid a nice fee, and risk was low. Even if I double spend they can take the game back.

Not Bitcoin! Ethereum! Stop blaming Bitcoin!

But. I've been purchasing Steam games, wallet etc with bitcoins for a while, and they were already instant. Are you sure lightning was involved?

Not a friend tho, just have him at my Facebook.
Yeah you're right, but they probably earn that stolen amount in less than 10 minutes, and they didn't care.
He's from Turkey, btw.

Or better - don't keep your online savings at somewhere you don't own? Keep it on a encrypted &amp; backed up paper wallet

A guy I know cheated on an exchange with this trick, stole 5k USD worth of bitcoins. As it's an international thing, exchange can do nothing.

It actually runs on a really big ledger. You cryptographically sign "I send 0.001 BTC to this address" with your private key, and send it to others to let them know.
They can cryptographically verify that it's actually you wanting to send bitcoins. It's put on a temporary pool, and unconfirmed now. Miners try to mine blocks, which has transactions. It's up to them to include your transaction or not. After creating a block, if the hash of it starts with 16 zeroes, it's a valid block, it's submitted to other Bitcoin users again. Miner earns X BTC, and the transactions inside it are confirmed now.
It's decentralized, everyone has this ledger, and everyone can individually verify it. They cannot change it because they are all signed, and blocks cannot be modified, as the blocks contain the hash of the older block.
Can't you just edit your Bitcoin app to give you 500 BTC? You can, but other computers don't have that edited version, so it will only work for you.
Can't you delete your transaction so your money stays in your wallet? You can! But other computers will already have newer blocks (and your TX), and you can't delete your transaction from millions of computers. If you somehow deleted it from all the computers in the world, and nobody is keeping your signed "I send x BTC to this guy" message, your money will be back! But it's impossible.
Can't someone just mess with the network by having a lot of mining power? %51 attack is an example of that, we need the miners distributed for this reason.
The wallets are just clients that do this signing and calculating things. You can memorize a number and that can be your Bitcoin wallet (brainwallet). It's very insecure though. Instead there's a long weird string that keeps your money safe from counterfeiting, inflation and theft by using the power of universe's laws.
