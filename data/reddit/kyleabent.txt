It's funny how much I "regret" or "not accept" asking for funds. But then I remember that "professional" counter-strike players are often interviewed with all these high tech cameras with threads imploding about how marvelous this persons hair looks.
I mean cmon, the guy kills people in a fake video game. He calls this his living. He broadcasts on twitch.tv and thousands of people watch him live for donate dollars to him.
Anywho, this is just my inspiration to be a little bit more open about my inside thoughts. These thoughts written here in paragraph format which are "incoherent without editing" are as raw as the music I provide.
If this is not to your standards, I would appreciate not a peer review proces, I don't wan't to fit to your standards. I don't care if my point does not get across to you.
Everything I've written stands the way it stands and it contains all the information required for anyone willing to invest time into, and if they don't want to invest time into it, then don't ask me to fit into their language so they can be a bit dumber for the day.
I guess I could thank you for allowing me to write this knowing a person out there reads this. 
Anywho... *clicks save.

I don't understand investing. I think it's an overnight thing. I want to get rich quick by buying into it. Seeing the price drop freaked me out but I did not sell. I admit feeling greed and fear due to this.
I buy drugs with silk roads and I'm not afraid of admitting this. On a related note I will be ingesting psilocybin mushrooms on april 23rd. But to get back to bitcoin, this is how I was introduce. Exactly one year ago I had 5 bitcoins and thought nothing of it aside from receiving drugs.
 If i am to be broke from this investment into bitcoin due to my poor decisions then so be it. I actually met a man in the supermarket the other day who told me I reminded him of his past, because he lost all of his money in the stock market. 
i am interested in bitcoins for my own self gain. To attain food without slavery. To pay these water, electric, oil bills with freedom. As my passion is not seen worth dollars in the eyes of others. 
I read alot about predictions or about comparisons to the past and I also live a life style not alike others. (Refer to psilocybin). I've invested $140 into bitcoin, with a total of 1.64 I am holding onto. I have a credit card balance of $1100 and only $76 remaining for food. I flew across the country away from ma and pa. I do not attend work and school. 
Best of luck bluequail.

I do trust you, but please relax. It's okay. It's okay!!! Why do you want to hold onto something that has this much control over your emotions anyway?
Happiness is internal and nothing exterior should be allowed to control that. I'm sorry for your loss. But please maintain control over your emotions and get back up there. You've lost $500. Accept it! BREATHE!!! :)

You may be correct. The price has been steady at $75 for some time now. But now we all know of the opportunity available.

I gambled $30 and lost it all at satoshicircle. May not be much to other people but this money came from my credit card wish sits at $850 outstanding balance. Now I wait for $70 to be deposited into dwolla and repeat the cycle.

I could have broke even with my initial bitcoin investment if I sold during the $250 spike. But I too am holding, even though the current $70 price tag is half that of what I invested. I'll just have to be smart about how I can get food now.

I certainly hope you are wrong. No offense. The price was steady around $70 until the climb began. Although my investment clouds my judgement as I am too hopeful for this to fail.
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:42:49
I'm extremely enthusiastic seeing as I invested more than "I can afford to lose". I just prefer to observe rather than interact. But I suppose I can change.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:02:36
At the day of the crash I remember thinking "Wow. $250. Doubt it can go higher than this. But at the same time I do not want to sell." The level of energy just did not compare to before hand where this subreddit was full of optimism.

On the contrary, I'm quite interested in this development. Think about it. Website after website of creative uses behind the spreading of bitcoin. So far all I've seen of these websites is the same thing: Sharing of dreams (in a sense). I have a youtube channel that I dedicate much of my time to without that equal return of attention that I think I deserve.. so I am interested in this idea.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:18:50

This is not like any crash in the past as this whole experience is entirely new. I'm attempting to stop predicting for less
fear/greed. A comforting truth is that none of us are in control.
