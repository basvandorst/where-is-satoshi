You'd have it invested and would not take all the growth. Average growth per year in an index would be a little over 10%, so &gt;$200,000 actual income per year.
4% rule (which is arguably conservative) would give you $80,000 a year *to spend* while actually still letting your capital grow both with inflation, and in 95% of cases actually grow significantly in real terms.

You missed that bit.
Adding stuff to a bill is not illegal as long as it is not done "with intent to render such bank bill ... unfit to be reissued".
So defacing a bill to the point is it unusable is illegal, but this isn't defaced to the point it is unusable/unrecognisable, it is still obviously $100.

It depends a lot on your age and your appetite for risk, but if you retire young and still expect to live for decades and decades it would make sense to keep a lot of it in equities at the return is greater with equities and *over long periods* drops in the market average out.
The main reason for moving into something "less risky" close to retirement is that if you retire at 65 you probably aren't going to live another 40 years and a relatively short-term crash could be devastating for you, and you won't have the years of life left to wait for it to build back up. So you move into more secure investments.
No-one investing long-term for their retirement just stashes cash in the bank. You wouldn't do that.
I mean Bitcoin is incredibly volatile and incredibly risky by comparison to an index. An index isn't totally risk-free, nothing that generates significant returns is, but it has the 100-year record of providing these consistent returns if held over the long-term. If you invested in Bitcoin at the mid-December peak you lose, lose lose as well, and a lot more than even cash. Long term we really don't know what is going to happen with it.
But you could trivially retire with $2m. I think people that think you can't just have no connection whatsoever with reality. The average individual income in the US is around $30,000. Median net worth at retirement is $200,000 *per household*. $2m is **ten times that**. And that $2k figure is by household, which typically is at least 2 people. You'd be comfortably in the top 10% of retirees, maybe top 5%. And this is in one of the richest countries in the world.

And that figure is already adjusted for inflation, the nominal return is over 10%.

I think $10k is a milestone of some sort with US KYC, might be why it's "up to $10k"

If you are really risk averse, you can just take the $2m and buy an annuity with it from an insurance company. You'll likely find someone willing to give you 4% for life on it, even from age 30, as they would expect to make much more than that from investing it.

I think that's pretty conclusive. When I saw the supercomputer claims and the SGI document I honestly really wondered why he would forge that given how trivially it could be debunked simply by asking SGI. I'm also surprised that neither Wired nor Gizmodo went to the lengths of actually contacting SGI themselves given the substantial other legwork they seem to have done on it. You would think it would have only required a phone call.

If you read their criteria for validation they say themselves they only validate a randomly selected subset "by contacting the site". Even if they DID pick him for validation, that could mean as little as calling a phone number that he gave them.
The list is a project run by a few prominent scientists working in the field, I imagine it's just not the sort of thing they'd expect attempts at scamming to get onto.
This guy was claiming to have the second largest SGI installation *in the world* and the largest one outside the US government, and SGI have stated they have never had any dealings with him or sold him anything. I think that's pretty conclusive evidence it doesn't exist.
The company that supposedly owned and ran this $100m+ supercomputer has just disappeared completely from the internet... That doesn't happen to large companies just because their CEO has issues. It doesn't exist.
@_date: 2015-12-11 11:49:57
Together with a clearly forged letter and endorsement supposedly from SGI that is full of waffle very similar to Wright's other writings? Note this letter wasn't leaked, either, it was published on Wright's company website, so it's not like you could allege it was the "hacker" who forged it, that was *definitely* Wright.
This was supposedly the second largest SGI installation *in the world* and the largest in the world outside the US government but SGI has never heard of the guy?
 
The Top500 guy has supposedly confirmed they never verified it?
The company running the supposed 15th/17th largest supercomputer in the world has no obvious address on their website and their phone number apparently shared with all his other shell companies?
There's not a single photo of the thing anywhere, even on the company's own website?
The company running the supposed 15th/17th largest supercomputer in the world has absolutely no independent third party corroboration of existence other than the Top500 list?
The company running the supposed 15th/17th largest supercomputer in the world has apparently abruptly removed itself completely from the web in the wake of this reveal?
This is only "inconclusive" in the sense that it only 99%  indicates Craig is a hoaxer, if you have any reasonable sense of probability whatsoever this pretty conclusively confirms it, particularly when combined with the other stuff.
"Inconclusive." Only if you are absolutely desperate that you really WANT it to be true.

I actually think *that* might be broadly the case, that he was faking being Satoshi privately to extract money out of people and possibly didn't actually want this big public reveal.
From what we know he supposedly had a company fail last year with the loss of 44 jobs (I haven't verified this actually happened) and so it's possible one of them was angry and leaked the other stuff.
But then again there's that appearance at the conference what a month ago where he hinted and hinted... So maybe not.
But there is plenty of evidence he has lied himself and tried to engineer the persona.

I would have thought they'd have mentioned it in the articles if they did, they mentioned contacting lots of other people that didn't confirm anything.
It's not the sort of thing that is usually particularly confidential either, and the supposed SGI letter was really suspect, it was full of the sort of nonsense verbiage that characterises Wright's own writing.
They didn't seem to contact Top500 over whether they had done any verification of the computer's existence either.

No, it obviously can't cover a situation where the entire US banking industry collapses. No insurance that has ever existed can cover all the potential liabilities, that isn't how insurance works.

Not specifically but he was a career software engineer so it is hardly out of the realm of possibly.
He also said himself in the AP interview that while he didn't create bitcoin, he had the skills necessary to do so. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 08:23:48
He fits the profile and he has the background and skills necessary while also having the same name. His original quote stating that he was "no longer" involved in it and had handed it over to others, which has been confirmed to be accurate by the LA County Sheriff's Department. His explanation that he was talking about his work in general seems weak when Leah is stringent they were talking about bitcoin.
The fact that while subsequently denying he created it to AP and claiming he knew nothing about what it was or how it worked they asked him if he would have been capable of creating it and he said "Capable? Yes" before maybe realising that wasn't a good idea and continuing to say any programmer could have done it.
The fact that his English in the videos seems absolutely fine *except* for his references to the word "bitcoin" which he appears to be deliberately mispronouncing and his strange diversion into a German-Russian mix. "I can't speak English, I misunderstood her" just isn't credible when he has lived in the United States since he was ten, for over fifty years, and has been married twice.
His whole reaction to Leah in the first place, seemingly being fine with conversing with her over email but then abruptly shutting down on the first mention of bitcoin. The reaction to her arriving at the door- he had been in email communication with her already and she had told him she was coming.
His subsequent demeanour with the AP seemed just so completely different, if his reaction to Leah was that of a befuddled confused old man scared about the strange woman who had appeared he seemed completely different in dealing with them, far more natural and with a sense of humour (I'd file the German-Russian bit under that).
The fact that the "real" Satoshi surfaced for the first time in four years quickly after the story broke to say it wasn't him. Hasn't been heard from for any other reason whatsoever but then pops up now. I think that was an attempted diversion from Nakamoto. (A hacked account is the other possibility.)
I'm not 100% sure it's him. But I think it's likely. Everyone on here is just fantically jumping on anything that suggests it might not be him, there is no balanced looking at the picture. I actually think a lot of them secretly believe it probably is him but are more concerned with his wish to remain anonymous. If they come out and say this however they are helping to remove his anonymity so instead we get this *extremely* bizarre rabid denial, jumping on anyone who says "I think it's him", and the whole Leah is a cunt, Leah is a whore, Leah deserves to have her career ruined and Newsweak deserves bankruptcy and they deserve to be sued into the ground over it (despite the fact they whatever you think about the ethics they did nothing illegal).
The rabid denial doesn't gel for me if it was just Newsweek pinpointing a random elderly Japanese American as the creator. Why does care so much about this random individual if he *isn't* the actual creator? I think it's because a lot think it IS him but that he deserves anonymity.

I wonder why that is, whatever could Malaysia and Arab countries have in common.
On the other hand it is far from universal, I remember drinking a local beer in Aleppo, Syria (Al-Chark), just before the civil war. I can't find anything on whether the brewery is still there and operational, but you'd have to doubt it, it's the sort of thing Islamic fundamentalists would tend to target. It's quite well established, too, would have been sixty years this year. 
Egypt, the largest Arab country, is also quite a significant beer producer, producing quite a number of extremely high alcohol beers (8-10%) which don't really make any aspiration to qualities other than "guaranteed to get you drunk, faster". 
There is also large scale commercial beer production in quite a number of other Muslim-majority countries such as Turkey and Pakistan, as well as the largest, Indonesia, all of whom have domestic "national beer" brands. 
Malaysia also does *brew* beer locally, it's just that the popular beers are foreign brands. I *think* most of the exported Tiger actually comes from Malaysia rather than Singapore. Beer in Southeast Asia is not exactly fantastic to be honest, probably the best of a bad lot are the local brands in Laos and Myanmar.

Presuming they are evenly centred on the midmarket rate you have to divide spreads by half to get the cost. A 5% spread means the cost to you is 2.5%, not 5%. There are companies that will give you a rate at least as low as 0.5% over the interbank rate, if not lower, with no additional charges.

Publishing pictures of houses is a well established right, there have been cases and the courts have definitively ruled it is legal. I mean "the Streisand Effect" was coined over Barbara Streisand (unsuccessfully) trying to get a picture of her house off the internet.

RAM is just not that expensive. I don't know what you are doing exactly, there are conceivable applications where you simply don't need more than 512MB RAM but they would be fairly specialist and unusual, that is a tiny amount these days. 
Database servers typically benefit from a lot of it; it enables them to cache data. We put 16GB in each of our database servers and that was five years ago. Whatever you are doing on those 512MB servers I am going to wager it is not running a RDBMS. 
We owned all our servers but even renting them (which we had done previously) RAM was not peculiarly expensive. Server RAM is more expensive than desktop but it's not *that* much more. CPU was the worst, if you wanted a bleeding edge one.

I'm not sure of countries where there are two legal tenders but there are certainly countries where two currencies are used, and each retailer decides which one they want to price in. In Cambodia for example they use the dollar and riel. 
There are also anomalies like the small exclave of Italy (Campione d'Italia) that uses the Swiss Franc rather than the euro - although it isn't up to individual merchants in that case.
There are other parts of the EU where NO currency is legal tender (such as Scotland.)

The vast, vast majority of people are not libertarians. It is a fringe position. I realise bitcoin was particularly popular among libertarians in the early days but as it gains more acceptance you are going to have to realise that most of the newer people coming into bitcoin don't share your particular political views.

Defamation requires damage to a person's character, which did not occur here. Accusing someone of being a murderer would damage their character. Accusing them of being a genius visionary inventor doesn't, even if it isn't true.

He's saying "sources close to Gox" but can't reveal who they are right now.
It seems that Gox drew up this document with the intention of seeking help/rescue/bailout/whatever you want to call it and met with other people in the Bitcoin industry, who rebuffed them.
These Bitcoin industry leaders (Blockchain.info, Bitstamp, BTC China, Circle, and so on) then published their joint statement in reaction to it- which originally referred to Gox's insolvency before it was changed on many (but not all of them.)
The supposition is that one of these people leaked the document to twobitidiot, who himself runs a Bitcoin business and has connections in the industry.
In light of subsequent events (the new "Gox" domain, the shutdown of trading, etc) much of the document seems to have been verified.

Anyway, the question I was replying to was not whether he actually did create bitcoin, but rather was there anything in his background suggesting he might have been capable of doing so.

You are trying to suggest that liquidation will not result in the return of substantial monies to creditors when it should in fact result in the same return Sunlot is promising- plus of course the $10m they are proposing creaming off the top at the very start of the process.
The class action attorney is supporting this because they will get paid, which they wouldn't get under a liquidation. How much are they taking out of this settlement? I note that was mysteriously missing in the press release. 
The entire press release constantly name drops supposed connections to successful businesses while being **completely** absent of any information as to the actual business plan, either (1) how they propose to "forensically investigate" and get more coins back, for which they are taking an up-front fee of $10m, or (2) how they propose to get Gox back up and running as an exchange and financially successful.
They are saying, look guys, trust us, give us $10m, and dangling false hope while providing absolutely no plan. 
I'm sorry, I see these guys as vultures who hope to swoop in and snag $10m off this corpse by misleadingly raising hopes of "full restitution" which anyone with half a braincell would know is not happening. 
Why should we trust these Sunlot bozos over the Japanese liquidation procedure, exactly? You are spreading FUD about the Japanese legal system so these guys can swoop in and extract some more money from these creditors before going, oh well, we tried, and quitting with the money.

Again, no one denies that inflation exists or that currencies go down in value over time. That is expected and normal and there isn't necessarily even anything wrong with it as long as the decrease in value in slow and steady. It may even be beneficial as it promotes investment over hoarding, which contributes capital to the economy.
I'm just pointing out that *oil* specifically is a particularly poor example of inflation as only a tiny portion of its price increase over the last decade and a half is due to inflation. Oil has actually, in real terms, got massively more expensive. It wouldn't matter if there was zero inflation, a barrel of oil would still cost almost ten times more today that it cost in 1999.
Plenty of things have got massively more expensive over the last 15 years, one share of Apple stock would be an example. Do you think that is down to inflation? Conversely other things have got way cheaper, such as LCD TVs or airline tickets. You can't just point to something that has increased in price and naively attribute the entirety, or even most, of that price increase to inflation.

Yes, in other words they are clearly distinguished as sponsored/paid content but in other respects appear the same as user submitted links. As long as the Bitcoin sites are marking stories as sponsored *and it is clear* I see absolutely no problem with it.
I'd have a problem with it if it wasn't clear (tiny disclaimer in the footer, whatever) but as long as it is clear I see nothing wrong with it.
Exposing sites that will stick up a paid article that is indistinguishable from an unpaid one is fine, that is unethical, but you are defaming perfectly legitimate sites that will take money but will mark those paid articles "sponsored". These sites have to make money somehow and that is a perfectly legitimate, ethical practice.

Iran actually has quite a significant problem with alcoholism, although illegal alcohol is widely available there but it is generally spirits as it is easier to smuggle. I cycled across the country and was regularly offered it. I remember one shop where I stopped to get something to eat the shopkeeper went into the back and came back with three shots of vodka. We didn't really want to given it was 10 in the morning and we had a long day of cycling ahead, so the shopkeeper shrugged and knocked back all three with a smile.
In Tehran if you knew someone who knew someone who knew an Armenian you could arrange a delivery. The son of the family running our hotel quite liked a tipple and he knew someone. He'd call his contact and 15 minutes later I'd go down and meet an Armenian on a motorbike. I'd hand him the money and he'd hand me a black plastic bag, inside which was whiskey. In cans.
We went to an Armenian restaurant one night hoping to score some wine, but it turned out you had to know someone and we didn't (other patrons were actually drinking wine; this is a well known restaurant in central Tehran.)
I was also given a beer when I visited my embassy, as they are allowed to have it :)

Insider trading outside of stocks specifically is often not illegal. It has only been illegal in commodities markets in the US, and only in very limited circumstances, since 2010.
There is nothing inherently illegal about trading something that is not a stock, based on privileged information. Specific acts, such as trading based on illegally obtained *government* information, or front running (buying/selling ahead of an order from a customer that you realise will move the price), are illegal in the US, but I don't think selling banana futures because of something you heard from an industry contact in the banana industry is illegal even in the US.
I'd be very surprised if it were illegal in Japan, which lagged far behind the West in instituting any insider trading legislation at all.

Positing "the USSR" as the only possible alternative to complete laissez-faire capitalism is a false dichotomy.
There are other alternatives, such as the system used in almost every developed country in the world, which are welfare states with a large amount of state involvement in industries such as healthcare, where it is beneficial.
For that matter the US itself is a mixed economy with a large public sector (almost half the economy- 41.6% of GDP). US public spending is actually higher than some European countries, it just spends more of that on the military relative to other developed economies. Even most *communist* countries actually have far smaller public sectors than the US does- Chinese government spending is only 23.9% of GDP.
Outside a few city states the only places that have really small public sectors are poor developing countries, places like Guatemala, Turkmenistan or Cambodia, where corruption and tax evasion run rampant.

Sticking your fingers in your ears and going la la la doesn't change reality. This is about the only sensible comment in this thread.
I don't see this scheme recovering **half a billion dollars** in lost funds through 0.15-0.5% fees on a disgraced exchange that no-one is going to want to use going forward voluntarily.
If we posit the average fee as halfway between these numbers, so 0.325%, even disregarding operating costs that is going to require over **$150 billion** of new money being traded on the exchange just to recoup the losses.
IF Gox has actually lost almost all their customer holdings, as seems to be the case, there is no rescuing it and there is no recovering those holdings. To think otherwise is simply deluding yourself. The money is gone,  accept it and move on- with another, more competent exchange.
As others have said, there is absolutely no good reason that new money is going to be attracted to Gox above the other exchanges that are out there.
The only situation in which substantial recovery of customer funds would be possible would be where they still actually still have the bitcoins in cold storage. Which given what we know seems unlikely, but the exact situation hasn't been confirmed.

I feel your constraing yourself this way interferes with the clarity of the statements because you are being forced by the letters to phrase them in a less than clear way. In many cases ("top-grade", "innovative") you are just throwing a filler word in there because it has the right letter, but it actually makes the message less clear and less succinct.

This was finally settled in 1998, but for many decades the British government (and by extension much of the British media) used the term "Eire" because they did not accept the name "Ireland" for the independent state (given that Northern Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom.)

It's an important distinction. A loan is an asset for the issuer. Loans can and are sold between financial institutions, they have a value ascribed to them. This value may be more than the outstanding amount of the loan, or it may be less, if there is a high risk of default. But one way or the other it has a value. Most loans *are* repaid.

It needs both stability and liquidity to be useful as a currency as everyone who might possibly use it also needs to use a fiat currency for the rest of their business/lives and so the value must be predictable compared to that. It's impossible to set prices if the value in fiat is bouncing all over the place.
Regular currencies are stable in relation to other in this regard; their value does change, but nowhere near as dramatically and rapidly as bitcoin. If USD, EUR, CNY and JPY were bouncing all over the place with regard to each other the way bitcoin is the entire world economy would collapse.
In situations where a single currency is doing this in relation to the main world currencies (and in particular USD), it quickly becomes useless and untrusted even domestically and local users switch to something that is stable, usually USD. This has happened in many many countries. Some, like Zimbabwe, Cambodia and Ecuador simply use the dollar directly, while others peg their currency to it.

Liquidation **isn't** nothing, though, that is the FUD these Sunlot bozos are trying to get people to believe so they can make $10m out of this mess before putting a knife in the corpse. 
In a liquidation the creditors will be paid out of Gox assets pro rata according to the amount owed them. So if Gox has $100m and owes $400, you will get $0.25 on the dollar. 
In the Sunlot plan this works exactly the same- *except* Sunlot cream off $10m off the assets before distributing what's left. And you have to trust Sunlot, who came out of nowhere, over the Japanese liquidation process.

If it is marked clearly as sponsored/paid for content I don't see anything wrong with it. This has been standard practice in print media for ever, where it is known as an "advertorial" or "advertising feature". There's no issue with doing it, the only issue is making sure it is clearly distinguished as paid content, which these guys seem to be doing.

That would be a stereotype, but hardly racist. There are jokes like that made about the American stereotype all the time. I mean the whole thing was a joke play on the eat, work, eat, work, sleep meme just tailored to the Chinese with "ban bitcoin" thrown in. I thought it was funny, and hardly racist.
Saying someone works at Foxconn is racist now? Seriously? Foxconn workers get well over the Chinese average wage you know, and significantly more (relatively) than Wal-Mart workers do, so I don't see how it even plays into a stereotype of a poor country, but even if you did it wouldn't be "racist". 
I'm *guessing* you are American. Honestly Americans are way over sensitive about things like this. If you are actually in China, I am sure you have seen actual racism, like many Asians they are pretty shockingly and casually racist themselves. I doubt a Chinese person would find this even offensive, never mind racist.
If Latvia had banned bitcoin and someone made a joke about no potato only hunger would that be "racist"?

This is absolutely standard with any credit card processor, it isn't something specific to PayPal. If there is fraudulent activity on your credit card and you do a charge back on a transaction, the merchant simply has to eat it. There are various steps merchants can take to *minimise* their exposure to fraud, and credit card companies will help you do this, but ultimately the risk is shouldered by the merchant. 
The flip side is that consumers get protection.
With BTC, neither side gets protection. Your coins get stolen and they are gone.
Different models, obviously there are advantages and disadvantages to each for the various parties.
The issue you are seeing here with PayPal is that you are a consumer, not a business, and so presumably are not used to receiving credit card payments and unfamiliar with the risks involved from the merchant side. 
It does also seem that you failed to read and understand the terms of service for what you were getting into.
But yes, selling BTC for any credit card payment, PayPal or not, is inadvisable. If anything, though, PayPal actually sides with merchants *more* than traditional credit card companies, it is actually a bugbear that people complain about on the consumer side.

I don't think anyone is questioning whether there has been inflation since 1974, of course there has. The issue is whether there is a problem with inflation, whether inflation is excessive now.


This is a confused sentence, you are comparing *nominal* consumer prices to real wages. Real refers to inflation-adjusted wages. Nominal wages have increased since 1974. Whether they have increased enough is another very valid question but you can't just compare nominal prices to real wages like that, it makes no sense.
**Oil** is also not a great example as it is a limited commodity that is running out. [The *real* price of oil has been going up steadily for the last fifteen years](
Most of the increase in the price of oil we have seen over the last fifteen years is a genuine increase in real price, not due to inflation.
A barrel of oil cost $10.95 in January 1999. $10.95 in 1999 dollars is $15.63 in 2014 dollars. But a barrel of oil didn't cost $15.63 in January 2014, it cost **$107.57**. That's not inflation, that's oil actually getting more expensive.

It was bank accounts, not "accounts" on Gox or wallets. Actual physical bank accounts, in US banks. Gox is an exchange so it necessarily straddles the fiat/physical and bitcoin/virtual currency worlds. They need bank accounts in the real world to conduct their exchange business, a full half of which necessarily involves receiving and sending fiat.
These bank accounts are readily available to government interference; it is much easier to get to Gox than an organisation such as Silk Road which operated 100% in bitcoin and didn't need any physical presence in the real world at all.

Any programmer with any experience knows how difficult it is to estimate the amount of work necessary to complete a project, and how impossible it is if you know nothing about what that project is.
I think he is the creator personally, but I was replying to a comment who stated that there is no evidence that he knows anything about cryptography or C++.

These demands for 100% proof of anything on Reddit are really bizarre. Most reporting doesn't reach that standard, it is unrealistic. I mean there wasn't 100% proof that Russia had invaded Ukraine, they were claiming it was locals, should the media have just "held off" on that one and said nothing about it?
What it actually signifies, I think, is a lot of people who have made up their minds about something and want to dismiss persuasive if not conclusive evidence to the contrary.

I had a quick Google for Australian currency exchanges. Ozforex specialise in low rates for large volumes and offer free transfers and no commission fees on transfers over AUD$10,000.
Looking at their rates their spread AUD/USD is just over 1%, ie. each side is a touch over 0.5% off the interbank rate.
This means that to transfer AUD$100,000 with them should cost you around $500.
No way in hell are you going to get anywhere near that with BTC, never mind the risk you would be exposing yourself to.
There may well be other currency exchanges and I have nothing to do with Ozforex. But your quotes of your bank charging 5-7% on the forex transaction are nuts, it would seem these guys will do it for a tenth of the cost.

I am not sure that is the case. If a retailer has a pricing error, for example, they are not required to sell you the item at the advertised price.
There are certain reasons you can't decline to sell to someone, like the colour of their skin or their nationality, but that doesn't mean you can't discriminate against customers for reasons outside those areas. A restaurant can refuse you service because they don't like how you are dressed, for example.
There are lots of regulations about display pricing in the EU but I'm really not sure that retailers are actually compelled to accept euro outside the settlement of debts.
Take reward schemes where you save up vouchers or points and redeem them for rewards. A retailer choosing to accept only bitcoin could be analogous to this. If it *does* require pricing/selling in euro (which I'm not sure it does) then sure, everything in the shop costs €1 million.

That was an Apple-designed, Apple-run payment system that Apple made money out of. They wouldn't be liable for third party wallet software.
It was also an out of court settlement of a class action suit by Apple, who acknowledged the system was not as secure as it might have been and made changes. It is not actually at all clear that a court of law might have ordered them to make refunds.
The settlement was voluntary on Apple's side, and they have voluntarily refunded similar charges in other jurisdictions without any lawsuits. They were getting a lot of negative PR over kids racking up large bills and it's very plausible that good PR was the reason for the refund policy rather than them being forced into anything.

That's physical passport theft, much more serious.
Most hotels I stay at make a *copy* of my passport and could do what they like with this info. Hundreds of people throughout Europe, Asia and the Middle East have pictures of my passport.
The Gox disclosure is more like this second case, they don't have the physical object, just an image of it.
It's quite difficult to create a fake passport from just an image, national security agencies such as Mossad do it when they want to assassinate someone abroad but most common criminals rely on stealing the physical object which is far easier.
The guys with the stolen passports on that flight probably weren't responsible for the crash, incidentally, they were more likely trying to illegally get into Europe. People travel on stolen passports all the time in this part of the world, you never would have found out about it if the plane landed safely. There have been previous incidents where crashes have definitely been down to pilot error and only when the passenger list was released there came to light several passengers with stolen passports on board.

Bitcoin *completely* replacing fiat isn't realistic but lack of access to computing/network infrastructure isn't really a barrier to widespread global adoption. There are plenty of other issues with it, but lack of access to infrastructure isn't really a big one. 
A LOT more people in developing countries have cell phones than credit cards; purely looking at it on an access basis it would be possible for Bitcoin to overtake credit cards as a payment method. I don't necessarily think it will, any time soon, but again, that is not due to lack of equipment access.
I have lived in developing countries in Asia for the last four years, including India (I'm a few hundred km south of it right now, posting this via 3G from my phone). Cellphones are very very common, even among very poor people. They honestly are prioritised over the other stuff you mention.

I think you are right, this is almost certainly a scam.
It's a very new site (DNS created July, updated under a month ago) and I can't find anything about them from a quick Google search.
Claiming HBSC and Paypal as "partners" is indeed a red flag. The site is very vague as to who they are or what their business model is, there is absolutely nothing substantive on it.
Giving a 5% bonus on any transaction priced at market prices makes no financial sense for their end. None whatsoever. They would be haemorrhaging money.
Also note: who posted this asking about arbitrage is a brand new account, only created five hours ago. Both who suggested this portbitcoin.com site (only for to edit in to his post) is a relatively new account with very little account activity (posts etc.) who replied about it saying "nice" is also an account with very little activity.
EDIT: who replied with all the promotion codes is also a relatively new account with no activity. new account, no activity, new account, no activity.
**Everyone talking about this site is a new account with no, or very little activity**  (six or seven posts at most) - and a lot of them seemed to have been created and made their initial posts around the same time, three months ago, and have similar patterns of posting.
I also note that both you and myself are downvoted for questioning this.

No, credit card companies in the US have explicitly been forbidden to prohibit discounts for cash since 2010, under federal law.




They could still prohibit surcharges at that time but since 2013 retailers are permitted to add up to a 4% credit card surcharge. The credit card companies were forced to allow this by a lawsuit.

I'm not defending him, just saying I don't think his *intention* was ever to steal coins. His behaviour is more consistent with someone who massively fucked up than a master criminal with a plan to personally run off with millions.
It is certainly possible that he has done illegal things in his reaction to the crisis, however. Often investment fraud in the traditional economy doesn't actually start out with fraudulent intent but rather as a reaction to try to cover losses.
Both the Japanese and American authorities have started investigations; it's certainly possible that laws were breached. If he was actively trying to crash the BTC price to try to work Gox out of the hole, as has been suggested, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to characterise that as fraud.

OK, New Zealand doesn't legally *mandate* the price displayed be inclusive but from a quick Google in practice most retailers display tax-inclusive pricing.
The *norm* in all retail situations in the US and Canada is that prices are dispayed ex-tax and added at the register. I have never been in a shop in either of those countries where tax was not added at the register. Conversely I have never been in a shop in any other country in the world where displayed prices excluded tax.
Tax-inclusive pricing is the norm for retailers everywhere else in the world, to the best of my knowledge: if you see a price on the shelf that is the price you are charged at the register. In some countries some (generally higher end) restaurants or hotels add a tax, but this doesn't happen in retail situations.

That wouldn't work if they lost as much as people are speculating they did (750k BTC on the books but only 2,000 BTC actually left/accessible).
Suspending inputs and outputs and allowing trading you are basically suggesting that people need to keep trading with their GoxBTC and GoxUSD until Gox has taken 99.75% of people's GoxMoney in trading fees. At this point, they could resume outward transfers and pay out the 0.25% remaining from the 2,000 BTC they still have.
I don't think anyone would be exactly happy with that, or put up with it for any length of time.
Note in this scheme with inputs and outputs suspended Gox only have whatever they have, no new BTC or USD can be introduced to the exchange. So ultimately what it comes down to is customers dividing that 2,000 BTC. The charade of allowing trading to continue for the *years* or probably decades or even centuries until Gox has recovered 99.75% in fees seems rather pointless, might as well shut it down now and split the assets (2,000BTC) among the creditors.

I don't, USD is still the de facto world currency. The only potential threat to that is the Euro and although it has gained some traction in forex reserves there hasn't been any major shift to pricing in it or pegging to it rather than the dollar. 
Bitcoin could be particularly interesting to Iran though as it is almost completely cut off from the world financial system due to sanctions. There are no "official" methods of getting money into or out of the country. Credit cards don't work there, you can't take money out of an ATM from a foreign account, you can't do an international wire transfer. The only way to get money in or out is to carry it all on your person, [in cash.]( 
So obviously a currency like bitcoin that has no physical location would open up the possibility of free payments in and out of Iran that could not be restricted through US/EU/UN sanctions.

@_date: 2015-08-24 11:13:03
You also need to bear in mind the exchange rate spread presuming you are also exchanging from AUD to GBP, not just transferring to an AUD bank account in the UK.
This is significantly more important than the fee with a large amount of money; [these guys for example]( will do large transfers fee free and make their money off their spread. Their spread for AUD-GBP is 1%, meaning you get 0.5% off the mid-market rate, which AFAIK is a pretty good deal.
This does of course mean the transaction is costing you $500 but I'm not sure you can get significantly closer to the mid-market rate, certainly unlikely with a high street bank anyway where you would probably be paying $30+some figure larger than $500.
Bitcoin can make sense for certain corridors where fees are very high but Australia-UK is very popular and competitive and so if you shop around you can get very low fees.

bitcoin - without capitalization, is used to describe bitcoins as a unit of account. e.g. "I sent ten bitcoins today."; it is also often abbreviated BTC or XBT.
If you follow either of those style guides, Bitcoin investor is indeed correct. Some other sources (like Wikipedia and the WSJ since last year) prefer to use lowercase in all cases, but there's nothing inherently wrong with "Bitcoin investor" as bitcoin is a proper noun.

It does, that is the exchange rate margin. This is actually negative for Nigeria as these wire services actually offer a better exchange rate than the official one.
Nigeria is relatively expensive likely largely as the government has exchange controls... which is also why these services can manage a negative exchange rate margin.
If you look at other corridors that don't have these government restrictions, such as US-&gt;India, you can see that even the heavyweight companies such as Moneygram and Western Union charge zero fees and make all their money on the exchange margin, at 0.28% and 0.56% respectively. That is very cheap.
 
Corridors such as UK-&gt;India are even cheaper, starting as low as zero fees and a 0.05% margin.

"Bitcoin CEO" only appears in the headline of this article also. The opening paragraph is quite clear on exactly who he is:


@_date: 2015-08-05 13:25:18
In my own experience with money changing in developing  countries if you go the right guy the margin really is that small, typically if you are exchanging cash in a major currency in a developing country you should not be seeing more than a 0.5%, maybe 1% at the most between the buy and sell rate. Also note that you can argue with them to get it down to 0.5 in countries that don't just give you that rate straight up.

It's 0.5% off the mid market rate rather than 3%, no extra fees. OK XE isn't 3% but it's still worse.
 will give the recipient £45,440 in two days (direct into their UK bank account) for $100,000.
$1000 only nets you £450.50 because they charge you a fee on small transactions but it's still better, and this guy wanted to transfer $100k which there is no fee on.
 recipient gets £456.71 for $1,000 which is even better as they don't charge a fee beyond the 0.5% even for small transactions. I think that's for an overnight transfer and they claim most of their transfers only take a few hours. £45,671 for the $100,000, even better.
For $100,000 that is almost $2,000 (£1,000) lower charges than XE.

There are certainly corridors that ARE expensive and where Bitcoin could potentially save money with certain types of transfers (generally low value frequent transactions, as many places for whatever the fixed fee is you can transfer $100 or $100,000), I'm just trying to point out that some money remission corridors are highly competitive (typically to developing countries with a lot of migrant workers abroad) and the rates there can actually be surprisingly low, due to market forces (competition).

It doesn't matter what it means "to you", it's what it means to the IRS if you get audited. He covers that, that the duration required for economic significance is shorter for more volatile investments. The point is you cannot say with certainty that you can sell and rebuy *immediately* and claim a tax loss. You need to have some risk meaning you have to be out of the market for some period. What that period is, is not clear.

Asset appreciation means assets that aren't money, stocks, real estate, whatever. If you aren't getting a decent interest rate on deposits it incentivises investment in something else that you expect will give a greater return. Lots of people doing this at once because they are all getting low interest raises demand for these assets which raises the price. Asset appreciation.

Exactly, I mean this line of thinking basically absolves Hitler of any crimes, to the best of my knowledge we have no evidence that he actually ever killed anyone personally, with his own hands. Just used his right of free speech to order the deaths of millions.
I mean it's regrettable, the Holocaust and World War 2, and all, but it would be far worse to have impinged on Hitler's right to free speech, the man was an artist. It's not Hitler's fault that when he told people to kill they went and did it.

If you read the articles I linked you'd see it is because the banks are afraid of falling afoul of government regulations. There are a lot of laws around not facilitating money laundering or doing business with unregistered "money services businesses" which exchanges are or may be. I don't think the banks care too much what you do with your money but in the current regulatory environment they themselves take on extra responsibilities if they facilitate one of these businesses.

That is utter rubbish.

They don't buy the BTC until they sell a share in the fund.
You buy share in the fund at price of fund + a small transaction fee. Fund buys stock, or BitCoin with your money. Every year the fund charges a management fee which is a percentage of total assets under management. 
The fund managers make their money from these two percentages, and as you can see they make it whether the fund goes up or down. They don't lose money in either situation (although obviously they do make more if the fund is worth more.) 
Profits made from actual swings in the price of the assets held by the fund go to the investors, not the managers. Risk is also borne by the investors, not the managers (they make their money either way.)
Apart from all that you can have active and passively managed funds. Passively managed just follow a declared, public formula with no room for divergence by the managers. (Such as, maintain a certain basket of stocks.) Actively managed funds can actively try to play the market as described, but generally aren't very good at it. On average, they make less money than passively managed funds that track an index.
As far as I'm aware most BTC funds are passive index trackers. You buy a share, they immediately buy a BitCoin. They don't mess around trying to time or move the market as described at all. But if they did, the risk (and reward) would still be borne by the investors in the fund, not the managers. Doing otherwise is highly illegal and managers have got long prison terms for doing it (up to life without the possibility of parole.)

I can go down to the market here (in Cambodia) and exchange a $5 note for riel. For that matter I can exchange a $1 note for riel, with a bid/ask spread of under 0.25% (that's the [bank spread,]( the market is cheaper) and no commission.

Changing $5 into the local currency here and back again would cost me 5c, and that's only due to the smallest currency unit here being worth 2.5c (I'd lose 2.5c each way- $10 would cost me the same.)
Cambodia has extremely low spreads on USD but most of Asia operates with no more than 2% spreads and no commissions. And they will certainly take low value notes from a major currency such as the dollar, as low as $1. And they'll take their own currency in any amount; the only place where you might have an issue converting low values is a non major currency into the local one (Iranian rial into UAE dirhams, for example, they wouldn't take amounts under the equivalent of $2 or $5- I forget which.)

Anyone holding bitcoin is doing so in anticipation of returns far, far in excess of 3.7%. I mean, the market is up 5900% on the start of the year.
If you are not anticipating returns in that sort of range, you shouldn't be in BitCoin in the first place. In which case you can invest it in the stock market. And if you are, why would you risk the whole lot for a measly 3.7%? It makes no sense.
The deposit limits make little sense either as you could just make deposits from multiple different addresses.

Have a look at [Bank of Shanghai's website]( where they try to explain their branding in English:


Folding fan is a symbol of wisdom in Chinese culture, standing for quality and wealth; each “fan rib” represents a single financial item. “Wisdom Whole Wealth” is a folding fan made up of intercrossing fan ribs, giving full play to the integration advantage of each financial service. “Wisdom Whole Wealth” service is not unchangeable; instead, it shall adjust flexibly to your demand to be sound to help you explore the potential for wealth today, and step on the way to a remarkable life in future.
