So you’re saying that the extremely poor majority population of China should organize a revolution, pop onto Ghost Gunner’s website, drop 2100 USD a pop on a couple dozen machines with the government watching, mass manufacture firearms, and overthrow the government? Seems like a pretty solid plan.
Oh, you can communicate through P2P networks. Great. I don’t know but back in the Qin dynasty the dude was conducting mass  executions by live burial for those who plotted anything, and I doubt they were using WeChat to coordinate. The people in China who don’t want to put up with the shit anymore are the ones who are poor, not the ones running Bitcoin nodes and worrying about decentralized communication platforms.

Right? It’s unbelievable how the majority of the population living in extreme poverty doesn’t just pack their farms up, get a visa/plane ticket, and immigrate to a - wait.

Is there a way to buy BTC with USD on Binance? When I checked it just seemed it was buying with credit card or whatnot at 3%+ fees.

So if I understand you correctly, instead of in my example hash(master+random int) it would be closer to hash(master+1,2,3, etc.)

Thank you, this answers my question!

No, it isn’t.
The value fluctuates on a daily basis, sometimes by thousands of dollars, and its buying power is linked directly to its exchange rate to fiat.
No major retailers - no, pretty much NO ONE accepts Bitcoin as payment. The few that “accept Bitcoin” are simply just automating the process of exchanging BTC to fiat and paying the merchant that way.
Until people are pricing their stuff in bitcoin, it is not money. It isn’t widely accepted, and the value fluctuates too much.

So how is this different from if you deposited cash into a bank account?
Would you no longer own the funds, then?

Why does it take the nature of the blockchain to make ownership of something binary?
Isn’t ownership always binary? For any given thing, can’t you either own it or not own it?

How high are you? What the fuck isn’t relative to spacetime? FTL objects?

ahaha, that's a classic.
I bet the people saying that are the first ones to jump ship when BTC dips a couple hundred dollars, too.

Generally people don’t get defensive in this position. You’d say, oh I got the date wrong and update it. Why do you care if he believes you? He didn’t even challenge your story as a whole, just pointed out something objectively wrong, without being a dick about it.
You’re the one who’s triggered and being a dick about it - you called him out for “trying to be a smartass” for STATING A FUCKING FACT that isn’t semantics as you say. This is the standard behavior of scammers when they’re called out. Not that I’m saying you’re scamming or gaining anything from this lol, it’s just the typical behavior.
@_date: 2019-12-05 02:55:05
Yep, he’s a liar as his behavior suggests. Pathetic, probably just looking for attention.

If you can’t do anything with it that you can do with real money, then it’s not money. It’s not really that complicated.
