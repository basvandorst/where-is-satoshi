there are plenty that are concerned that this is a flawed model.

Maaan, u're just inviting an alt coin brigade

I'm waiting for some large company to offer some micro amount of bitcoin as a perk for their employees. One could probably make a good business out of this. Be an agency that sets this up for companies. 
@_date: 2015-06-26 12:18:45
yes, just like most people trust management of their current money to banks etc. 
@_date: 2015-06-25 15:22:10
agreed. I haven't seen any good solutions to this problem yet though. spreadcoin had an interesting solution, but they've devolved to some sort of staking. Treating the entire mining network as one pool could be interesting, but then you have payment distribution problems. But both these extra-protocol solutions. Intra-protocol, I dunno. The whole mining thing is currently in a strange sort of MAD, which is human-centric, which seems (to me) the antithesis of the protocol. 
yeah, this is one of the things that has perplexed me about bitcoin and these forecasts."those few nodes will be server farms" != decentralized. We're then trusting things again.

My opinion? Most of them are crap. Some of them are good. The ones providing additional utility are good. Re: this monero discussion, it boils down to one fact.
If you post your bitcoin address, I can probably find out, thanks to these new blockchain analytics companies, how much money you have.
If I post my monero address, it is possible you could find out how much money I have, but its not probable. 
The delta in effort is extraordinary. 
If you think financial privacy is not an issue, please post your real-world bank account information along with your bitcoin address.

Yeah mining centralization is one of the problems I have with bitcoin. There are two types of mining centralization though. Pooled mining is one thing, but physical large mining centers is a whole different beast, and bitcoin has both. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:37:17
hell, it even goes so far as to suggest that a bitcoin business has to get additional insurance coverage...


42 require the applicant obtain additional insurance coverage to address related cybersecurity risks
43 inherent in the applicant's business model as it relates to virtual currency transmission and to
44 the extent such risks are not within the scope of the required surety bond.
You know, so the company would have to get good cybersecurity practices in place so, yah know... its customers wouldn't be at risk of having their funds stolen....
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:25:40
No let's call it what it is... An Excel spreadsheet
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:59:28
But how can we buy a lambo if the tx fee is a lambo?
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:38:23
its not about volatility, its about money being stolen. 
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:32:18
Yeah, the first instance I see of "virtual currency" is


So basically it means that anyone involved in money transmission has to get licensed. Whereas money transmission is defined 


23 a. Sale or issuance of payment instruments or stored value primarily for
24 personal, family, or household purposes; or
25 b. Receiving money or monetary value for transmission or holding
26 funds incidental to transmission within the United States or to
27 locations abroad by any and all means, including payment
28 instrument, stored value, wire, facsimile, or electronic transfer,
29 primarily for personal, family, or household purposes. This includes
30 maintaining control of virtual currency on behalf of others."
So it specifically states "to engage in the business of" which I interpret to mean you are running a business (selling a service or product to someone), not merely functioning as an individual managing your own wealth. 
Thus, I ponder whether it would cause the p2p market to shut down - are these individuals engaging in business? 
I guess we need a lawyer to parse what exactly is meant by "engage in the business of".
If it reads like I think its reading, its a bill that would actually pave the way for virtual currency businesses to become legitimate. Which is ultimately interesting for a state that has a major banking center. 
@_date: 2016-06-08 17:32:32
so it fixes the connection to ip but not on-blockchain data traceability? 
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:39:59
read the damned bill first
@_date: 2019-11-13 16:29:57
Blocks without work. So true. Amazing ppl don't get this.
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:42:22
dunno why your engaging with this guy :) Though I guess a FUD campaign can cause harm. Hopefully people just ignore him. Its like you invented the screw, and this guy is yelling at you because everyone is still using nails. 
logics. 
@_date: 2016-12-11 00:56:26
seriously... this is the part I don't fully understand about LN and payment channels. 
Though I guess the theory is that some people will run services, so while I may not have a payment channel with Amazon, Bob does - so I can use bob's payment channel without having to make a contract with Amazon, but Bob maintains the contract. 
I dunno. something about the whole thing I still don't like. It seems permissioned and trustful. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 18:57:35
gotcha. I was just confused over "full control over your bitcoins"... 
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:46:58
Does the user control the private keys? 
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:22:44
My point was who do those names all work for?
The banks.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:52:54
@_date: 2019-08-27 22:09:41
No, the banks did that.
@_date: 2019-10-01 03:53:32
yeah we'll see. I got my money on these professional farms aint gonna go through the hassle of running nodes, and any pool that requires it will loose hashrate, or the asic farms will just get the data from someone else.
@_date: 2019-10-26 22:33:27
"we can blacklist your outputs"
"I use monero!"

"Use our Excel spreadsheet!! It's better than theirs I swear!!"
@_date: 2019-08-28 13:07:21
It doesn't matter what philosophy they work with. It's the fact that their goal is to enrich themselves. 
You think they give a rats ass about the people? 
Got it
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:16:28
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:03:11
indeed. To met its just if its not decentralized it has no value. You might as well just use a database managed by somebody if its not decentralized. When it comes to the actual use of bitcoin as money, its because its decentralized. When it comes to the fact that bitcoin is a revolutionary new kind of money, its because its decentralized. And its immutable because its decentralized. 
im just ranting against all of the network centralization occurring in this space and everyone just turns a blind eye.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:58:17


Except the protection of an immutable ledger secured by proof of work.
And who is providing protection from the whims of the central banking system? 
Its incredible, even after 9 years the amount of people that don't get it. 
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:31:00
well yes and no, thats the problem with asic centralization. To reverse transactions, you just get together the major asic players and their farms and you coerce them into doing it. I mean, the same can be said about mining pool operators, which is why this new stratum is so important. 
But unfortunately there's no way to enforce it. And I bet even if it does happen, no miner is gonna run a daemon to actually create their own block templates.
@_date: 2015-07-08 00:28:36
and miners are getting paid. These future super attacks you speak of are just wealth redistribution. 
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:52:46
like what other things?
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:58:04
there are plenty of things that are immutable and scarce.
@_date: 2015-07-24 17:20:05
@_date: 2019-12-02 16:33:03
And yet bitcoins whole value lies in it's decentralization
@_date: 2015-07-23 16:41:55
i view it as kind of convoluted.... true, they aren't using the currency... they are using the database. However, in order to get space on the database, you have to pay for it. It just so happens that the way you pay for space on the database is with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:11:54
well that doesn't bode well for decentralized miner production methinks
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:57:35




My brain hurts. I'm assuming the writer means pseudonymous, but c'mon. Bitcoin's been around for 6 years. We should know this by now. 
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:16:17
Do you pay your employees in bitcoin, or have you offered to pay them in bitcoin?
Have any of your employees asked to be paid in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:40:22
hopefully. 
I think it would increase the monopoly. If there's no room for advancements, what edge would any new asic manufacturer have over the existing companies? These companies can use their existing monopolies to keep competition out.
@_date: 2019-12-27 03:39:29
Well that's magic internet money if I ever saw it!
@_date: 2016-09-18 18:08:45
me. traceable. non fungible. has a use, but not money. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 05:32:28
Transactions don't need to be solved
@_date: 2017-09-19 21:16:40
but but but... how do we get more volume and mindshare to strengthen our prviacy offering without blind fanboyism??
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:07:15
thats nonsense. This is bitcoin. He could use any of the tools to see when his keys became associated with the coin movement. 
Or the IRS could hire a company to do the same thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:06:14
in tents and porpoises! 
@_date: 2019-09-30 22:48:49

No they don't. One cpu one vote died long ago
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:08:14
That's ok there are plenty of other options
@_date: 2019-09-30 19:19:15
Those aren't nodes.
@_date: 2019-09-30 21:13:26
no, they mine to a pool.
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:30:15


are you sure? If its mining on a pool, its still a pool. Yeah, its a solo pool, but you are still contributing hash to one single version of the potential next block as decided by the pool operator - in this case, bitmain or whatever. 
unless its using the pool protocol that apparently no pool uses (the one where individual miners actually make their own blocks and just share the reward)
@_date: 2016-10-06 16:36:49
uh wut?
@_date: 2016-10-27 18:29:41
interesting point. Then it probably boils down to ease-of-node running, but if you were already setting up a VPS, then presumably u can get a box running at home. 
@_date: 2016-10-03 17:38:56


@_date: 2018-04-11 02:01:52


i think thats the best typo i've seen in a while
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:32:01
I doubt it. 
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:36:01
@_date: 2017-05-15 12:37:53
U ever look up the tax rates of that era?
@_date: 2018-04-13 04:01:29
damn he's good
@_date: 2017-07-16 03:54:15
were they all mined by the same pool? 
@_date: 2016-07-29 09:45:18
i've avoided it as a means of value storage (long term) because there's no way for anyone to guarantee that any coins won't be white or black listed. So, fungibility concerns. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 06:49:05
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:09:58
Not really... The point of crypto is to not need banks... So we won't need exchanges... So there's no exchanges to crash with high volumes.
