not obviously, but in the UK, I can get 5% interest in my account for the first year, access to regular saver 5% for as long as I like. With my old account I got 6% regular saver.
Trouble with regular saver accounts is I have to open a new one every year, as they close after 12 months and I then get paid my interest. They also have a limit as to how much you can put in each month. So it's good to save income you have coming in, but then you need to find a longer term solution for the money.
So for longer term savings with a traditional bank, I can get 2% if I lock my money away for 3 years.
If I want to do better than that, I'll have to accept some risk by doing things like peer to peer lending/investing. Where I can earn between 5% - 12% depending on my tolerance for risk. And the obvious path of investing in the stock market is another option, where I have tracker products I can use.
UK inflation rate is 1.4%. So it is entirely possible to beat inflation without using bitcoin, if I choose to do so. It's only when there is really high inflation that things like that become a problem. The people "losing out" to inflation in normal circumstances are the ones who are not saving properly.

This is included in the inflation calculations.
Remember that inflation is the increase in the prices of things I can buy. So goods and services getting more expensive because of currency exchange rates (buying stuff from overseas becoming more expensive, for example) will be part of it automatically.
The rate I quoted is possibly a bit out of date. I'm expecting it to increase to the 2.x% range at some point. But unless it goes above 5% what I said still stands true unless the achievable savings rate drops as well.

If you have purchased gold on a gold exchange, do you own it? Do you take their word that you've actually bought anything at all? Maybe they are lying about how much gold they actually own, and you've purchased a whole bunch of nothing. Not fun when it comes to selling it, is it?
Unless you can take delivery of it, hold and touch it in your hands, that gold isn't really *yours*, is it? It's just a promise that someone else is holding it for you.
Similar situation with bitcoin. Unless you are the sole owner of the private keys to your bitcoin addresses, then you can't 'hold and touch' your bitcoin, as Coinbase/whoever is looking after it for you. What happens if Coinbase suddenly vanished? You can't login to get your bitcoin out, you don't have the private keys, so you can't tell the bitcoin network to move your money somewhere safe. You're SOL.
This is a noob friendly way of getting into bitcoin initially (it's how I started), but any experienced bitcoin user will tell you; you should wise up and learn how to have bitcoin in your own addresses, especially if you're holding enough for it to hurt if it went missing, with your own private keys that are secret that only you can access.

So say I had a theoretical choice, and everything else (bandwidth, uptime, weather conditions etc) being equal, which would be the greatest benefit to the network? 
* running one full node on say, a recent intel i5 with 8gb of ram. It's maybe a shared resource but Bitcoin gets what it needs and isn't malnourished for resources most of the time.
* running 10 raspberry pi nodes (dotted around the globe, not on all on the same IP), but they are pruned to say, 30/60gb. The node would be almost the only thing running on the pi.
I'm assuming both are better than running no node at all, but I'm unclear as to the extent of the negative impact of a slow pruned node vs a well equipped full node. Are less full nodes always the preference over more pruned nodes?

It might be because BU nodes are based on a pre-segwit code...
Or it might be political reasons. It does seem that when I read some quotes from more 'fringe' (and by that I mean "CORE IS KILLING BITCOIN WITH SHILLS!!!omgomgomg!") BU supporters I tend to see an argument around 'technical debt' when it comes to segwit.
Honestly I don't see a technical reason for it. BU nodes and miners could support both. That way, when segwit activates, we get an immediate, if temporary, relief from higher fees, we get lightening network and co maybe having a shot at solving scalability off-chain, but we still have BU pushing what they consider to be a superior solution of on chain scaling.
But of course, emotions will always get in the way of that, won't they? :(

The fact you are responding says otherwise.


Three years and counting for me. Only had an issue when they had an outage which lasted a couple of hours. So extrapolating my experience, the "truth" is that 100% of coinbase's customers don't ever have any serious problems.
Oh wait, that's not right either, is it? 
So no, the anecdotal unverifiable "evidence" in the posts around here and your pathetic little list prove nothing and is by no means the "truth". You are once again pushing your agenda because you have this strange chip on your shoulder.
I shall continue to use coinbase when it suites, as well as the other services I use. As soon as coinbase rips me off, I'll let you know. Don't hold your breath.

And... 


I literally gave you a Google search showing the racist nature of the image used. It would've taken you less than 5 minutes to check this yourself.
I totally accept you may not have known the origins of that image or it's racist undertones, but your response to go on the offensive was 100% the wrong thing to do, especially when you're trying to represent your brand.
Maybe next time, instead of taking a leaf out of the Amy's Baking Co's book of social networking, just consider you might have actually put your foot in it, even if accidentally, and just ask for basic clarification next time instead of being a dick about it. You shitty response is the entire reason you got a shitty response back from me. 
All you had to say was 'I don't get what's wrong with the image, we found it online and didn't think it was antisemitic, could you elaborate?' and then take the response seriously and spend 5 minutes doing basic Googling. Instead you chose to respond with bitey little side comments like a bully would do.

Some sellers on localbitcoins.com have automated processes. As long as you have your id verified with localbitcoins.com themselves (not the seller) the process is basically automatic with some sellers.
You get a message with account number, sort code and reference. Send the money, get the bitcoin around 1 minute later.

Not too sure where to begin... 
* you should attack the argument, not the person, otherwise you look like you have a chip on your shoulder 
* following on from that, you should actually have an attack for the argument. This is an incoherent rant and you seem to be drunk actually. You've literally added nothing to the debate.
* resorting to swear words makes it look like you lost the argument, not that you did a great job of communicating anything in the first place, and just makes you look like a sore loser. 
* u is not a word. It's a letter. You are not writing a text message to a 14 year old.
* r is not a word. It's a letter. You are not writing a text message to a 14 year old.

Your node would be full within 6 months with 4mb blocks.
Sure, data storage is still cheap, but if you're using a vps just to help bitcoin by running a node (again, making assumptions here), then just a few dollars a month change could be enough to change from "sure why not" to "eh, I'll not bother" 
Obviously pruned nodes help, but full nodes are important as well and they need to exist.

I'm gonna be honest. This is kinda cool tech, but I really don't see the advantage for the user.
The kind of user that cares about this would buy from localbitcoins, or coinbase or whatever. The money is there for, I dunno, 5 minutes, and then the account is emptied into bitcoin addresses that the user fully controls. The risk is minimal compared to all the other ways things can go wrong.
Other users that don't care about having their private keys obviously have plenty of options as well. 
Like I said, this is cool tech, and it's nice to see more competition, but I personally don't think there is much of an advantage for the user. 
Unless I'm missing something, of course...

I sent £100 worth of bitcoin yesterday for 17 pence. Took just under three hours to confirm. I deliberately set a low fee because I didn't care if the confirmation time was long as long as it was done within the day. The high priority cost option was about 30 pence if I remember correctly.
Value for money if you ask me. Sure I'd love to have paid zero fee, or 16 pence or lower fee, but 17 pence is fine by me.
If you're spending $5 on fees you are doing it wrong. Or lying. I don't think I've ever once paid more than about 50 pence (whatever that is in dollars).

Not it wasn't. This is verifiably untrue. The founder of the website admitted to setting it up and is now doing life in jail for it. Or is that massive hole in your theory somehow unknown to you? You repeating this untrue statement again and again doesn't magically change the facts. I know you're kinda the resident troll around here, but at least put a little effort into it. 
It's perfectly possible that the FBI/NSA were running the site **after** the servers were seized, but it was never set up as a honeypot from the beginning. In both cases, we'd certainly know of it by now as the prosecutions would be public knowledge as they'd be working their way through the court system.

It's worth mentioning that it's unclear if the FBI actually uploaded the child porn to the server after seizing it, or if they simply allowed the site to continue to run as it was in order to catch the site's members. Nobody seems to have a firm answer to this and it's is a fine distinction that needs to be known to form an informed opinion. The reported growth in the website's size and traffic doesn't automatically mean the FBI were uploading content. It's highly unlikely in my view that they were creating new content even if they did upload extra stuff to the site. They probably genuinely have a 'stash' from previous cases etc.

@_date: 2016-09-06 04:34:09


Nothing whatsoever. Are these called "stings" or something?
The FBI's job is to catch criminals. In the eyes of US law, buying coke is illegal (not weed so much anymore) as is viewing or creating child pornography. So the FBI and wider law enforcement does whatever to catch the people breaking the law. It's their job. And nobody should be pissed off at the FBI for using the tools at their disposal for doing it unless they too overstep the mark legally. I'm unsure if US law would allow them to send drugs to people in order to arrest them (my hunch is that it does) so that's another point to consider.
If anyone has a problem with that, they should: move to somewhere where their activities are legal, and/or push for change in the law, and/or make a calculated informed decision of the risk of being caught and they consequently of what may happen if they are caught. This applies to both drug users/dealers and pedophiles. Child pornography is legal in some countries so moving is genuinely an option (although these are not countries I would wish to live in).
If the risk of getting caught and the punishment is unacceptable then they shouldn't do whatever it is they are doing. It's just logic.

As far as I'm aware that evidence was never challenged by Ross or his defence team.


Yes he was:
I have no idea why this narrative keeps coming up. It's demonstrably false and can be checked with the briefest of Google searches. The charge was, however, later dropped. To say he was 'never charged' is simply factually false.
Also, this helps to flesh this out a little, from Wikipedia:


There is no point in charging him for the murder parts as he was going to get life in jail without possibility of parole anyway. Why the charges were dropped is speculated here:  but we'll probably never know for sure. If Ross gets an appeal granted against his sentence, you can safely bet those charges might suddenly become un-dropped.
I'm not saying the trail was perfectly executed, I'm not saying the judgement was even fair given the crimes he was actually sent down for, that's another discussion. What I am saying is that: Yes he was charged, those charges were later dropped, *however* the evidence that he attempted to procure murder was taken into consideration during sentencing, not that it mattered as he would have gotten life without parole anyway.

@_date: 2017-05-22 21:33:06
Evidence can be taken into account when sentencing, yes. That's how it works. It helps to determine motivation, character, likelihood to re-offend etc.
Again, the evidence wasn't challenged, so it's admissible in court, so it gets used. If it got thrown out, such as some of the testimony was in this trial (from the prosecution, I might add) then it can't be used. Easy.

No. If there is a chain split you'll have bitcoin on both chains. The chains may loose value for political reasons but the number of bitcoin will remain consistent. Very similar to what happened when ethereum hard forked and ethereum classic appeared on the old code.
There may be a chance of replay attacks (where you move money on one chain but the other chain also moves the same money) but that can be dealt with, just be careful and do some basic research as and/or when this happens and you'll be fine. Reading up on what happened to ethereum might help you.

And we continue with the lies. 
You presented no evidence whatsoever. None. Nothing. Not a single link. Nothing concrete I could research, nothing, just your opinion which was usually a factually incorrect one liner (ie. "Ross was never charged with soliciting murder", something which is verifiably false by court documents, no less) with spelling mistakes.
I brushed off nothing as nothing was presented by you. 
Yet you continue to lie and say that I did something which was impossible for me to do as you presented no evidence.
I'll say it one last time: you presented no evidence at all, yet you are now claiming I 'brushed off' the evidence that you never presented. In fact, when I pressed you on it, I believe you said, and I quote: "any sources I provide will be ignored by you". You then proceeded to provide no source whatsoever and then called me a troll.
So again. You are a liar. You are claiming that I brushed off evidence when none was presented.

If I was being charged for tax evasion, and I was somehow accused of being a child molester then yeah, that wouldn't make much sense, and would probably warrant another trail for the second charge.
If I was up for assault, and there was evidence that I was generally a shit who got into fights all the time and not the tree hugging pacifist who was 'just defending myself' that I was claiming to be, then maybe that evidence should factor into my sentence.  One gets community service and fine, the other gets time in a harder institution. The prosecution wouldn't have to *prove* I was being a shit to passers by and spitting on puppies, but they would maybe be able to assert that I wasn't a generally nice person through various means, even if the evidence against me wasn't 100%.
Context matters.
See how that works?


Please cite that evidence relevant to a case shouldn't be considered as part of the sentence (and yes, his DRP activities and *everything* he did on Silk Road are relevant to this trail) and doing so is somehow illegal. In fact, please actually start citing sources for **any** of your arguments. Thus far you've given nothing but your opinion and blatant fabrications with no basis in reality.
If that was illegal then A) The judge wouldn't of done it, and I think the judge knows a fair bit more about the legal system than you or I, and B) The appeal would've been open and shut and at the very least, Ross would've got a sentencing retrial or a maybe even a full retrial, and C) The judge would've probably got into some hot water for doing something so obviously 'illegal'.
Just because you don't like the outcome of the trail doesn't mean that everyone involved was corrupt and constantly breaking the law. Ross broke the law, a fairly major one in the United States, which has harsh penalties. That law being just and right or otherwise is a completely different discussion. He broke the law, he got caught, he got punished. Maybe the law will change in a few years and Ross will be pardoned and set free, but don't count on it.

You might be on to something here:


I know it's genuinely difficult sometimes, but try not to paint us all with the same brush.
Although I concede that one of the reasons I like and use Bitcoin is because I want to off-ramp on the broken money system that most western countries have. I don't like it and I want out. The fact that bitcoin keeps going up and up in value is nice, but I'm not doing it to 'get rich' like many others. I want to opt-out of what I consider to be a shitty/corrupt/broken monetary system. Frustratingly where I live it's not that easy, but I do what I can, even if I'm mostly based in fiat.
I suspect that many others are like me in that regard, and yes, that does attract a certain 'crowd', like it or not. But we're not all alike, and that's a good thing.

[No, it just returned to where it was. Usual bitcoin volatility.](
That U shape is around the time of the Brexit vote. It went down, it went back up. Brexit had little impact. Reward halving is also having little impact. Bitcoin is up a bit, but it's just the usual [ebs and flows of this thing](

Said the same about Brexit, and the halving of the miner reward. Yet both of these events made little impact on the price of bitcoin beyond it's normal volatility when they happened.

That's closer to freenet's model. Which is significantly slower. Not everybody can run a node.

Coinbase is where I brought my first bitcoin. It's where I kept buying for a while, and is a service I recommend to newbies.
Yeah, the ID requirements were a bit of a drag, but no worse versus opening a regular bank account where I live, slightly easier, actually. Everything verified fairly quickly if I remember correctly.
Never once had a single issue with them.
If they are trying to slow the adoption is bitcoin, they failed spectacularly in my case.

I've heard good things about nationwide. YMMV.

This might help:
The public key is like your email address. 
The private key is like your email password. 
If you trust others with your email password, you are trusting them to not send emails to others or whatever. If you trust someone with your private key, you are trusting them not to steal your bitcoin.
Some exchanges 'hide' this information for the sake of ease of use. But this is dangerous if the private keys get leaked or the exchange goes bust or otherwise fails.
Your private key can generate your public key, but it only works one way. You can't go from public to private. Losing your public key isn't therefore a disaster, losing your private key is.
Once you 'get it' (and it took a little while for me to get it, don't worry) it's really easy, honestly. And it puts you in total control. Just use that control wisely, as nobody can bail you out.
@_date: 2016-07-20 13:46:07


Because verification takes time, and very often daily/weekly limits are well below what OP requires.
@_date: 2016-07-01 19:46:24
Outlawing bitcoin is a very real threat... bear with me here.
So say $country outlaws bitcoin... So what, it's decentralized, right? Well yeah, but it's possible via some kind of Great Firewall of $country that they could make the technology more difficult to use, requiring the need for VPN/proxy whatever.
Okay, fine. So you use your VPN or whatever to get around that. Not news to most on this sub.
Then you find the few places of $country that take bitcoin in person don't take bitcoin anymore for obvious reasons. Well, whatever, you never used them anyway.
THEN you find that actually selling the bitcoin you have is suddenly illegal. So now you have to use something like purse.io to shift it, which will be difficult as purse.io has ceased operations in $country. Shit. So now you have to use some strange back of the alley way to shift your coin, probably at a hefty cost to you.
All of the above makes bitcoin adoption difficult, which in turn lowers demand and adoption, which in turn lowers the price of bitcoin.
So now that 100BTC you've been sitting on isn't worth so much anymore 'cos your country of residence happens to be $country. Sucks to be you.
Oh wait... $country is actually fairly large and has a large bitcoin userbase. Everyone that can sell is selling. shit shit shit... now it's affecting everyone.
Grossly, grossly oversimplified, of course. But a country like, I dunno, France, UK or China or something outlawing bitcoin could have a large impact on things for all of us. Especially China. To say bitcoin is utterly immune to these and shout "it's decentralized!" as if that's some kind of silver bullet is simply wrong.

Who says I didn't attempt to return the coins? I emailed them several times and they completely ignored me. I placed one order, got charged twice and received twice the coins.
Their incompetence could well have put me into financial difficulties, but they didn't care. I was honest and up front the entire time, they chose to ignore me, so fine, I'll go another route to recover my funds. 
Seriously, fuck Coinbase. If they do come after me I'll drag my heels and make it as difficult and slow to recover a damn thing as I possibly can. Seems 'fair' to me.

In relation to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-05 21:30:21
Similar issue to me. Been over a month now and even got a bot saying sorry and to reply if my issue was still ongoing. I replied. Radio silence.
Except my extra charges were on credit card. Did a chargeback and it's all sorted now and ended up with free crypto.
Even though I 'won' in that situation, I'm never using them again for any reason. Bunch of incompetent cowboys.
If you get shitty service, vote with your wallet. If they ever reply to me (I'd imagine they want their coins back), I'll simply send a 'automated' response back apologising for the delay, but I am really busy and have had an influx of new customers, and I'll endeavour to contact them directly within 6 months.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:32:40

The malware would alter the address he should send it to. So the website should display address A, but address B is shown instead. Wallet (hardware or otherwise) isn't affected, just tricked into sending to the wrong address.
I have no idea if this type of malware exists or if it's even possible/practical to do this. Closest I know of is the malware that swaps addresses in your clipboard, which I think is what OP is a victim of.
@_date: 2017-06-06 23:13:22
Yes. They even have long lists of addresses so the software can pick one that looks similar to whatever is in the clipboard.
Even a hardware wallet wouldn't save you if you didn't catch it.
Always remain vigilant.
@_date: 2017-06-04 13:07:29
Indeed. Comments like the above is making the assumption that sellers on backpage.com will have a clue what any of this means or what they should do about it.
People are playing with fire with BIP148. This won't end well. And trying to rebrand bitcoin as the 'legacy' coin won't fool anyone.
@_date: 2017-06-10 05:19:31
I'm about to break even in about the 3 months. At that point I'll be 9 months into a 2 year contract which I've paid for.
Even if the difficulty increases drastically in the next 3 months I'll probably still turn a profit.
Although that was litecoin mining. I wouldn't touch bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2017-06-10 06:38:30
That's the option that Genesis offered at the time. 
I only put in a small amount to dip my toe. As usual with crypto, my only regret is not buying more.
Honestly I just saw it as a really slow way of buying. Turns out I'll get out more than I put in but maybe I was lucky.
Wouldn't of minded a small loss, by time you pay fees and whatnot on exchanges you're always 'at a loss' anyway.
@_date: 2016-07-20 18:36:06
OP doesn't want to wait for verification. Even with verification, the limits I've experienced are way way below what's needed here.
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:06:37


On the contrary, and this is from a bank, no less:
The smart businesses give a shit about their public image, even if that means making brave/expensive decisions about how they conduct themselves. Even if that means turning away new custom to serve existing customers properly.
The stupid ones allow themselves to become over subscribed in this manner, and do serious long-term damage.
I would genuinely respect Coinbase for turning away new customers right now whilst they dealt with capacity issues. Instead raw greed got the better of them. This will bite them in the ass someday.
