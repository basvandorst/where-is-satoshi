I'd surmise that only 16 million bitcoins or so will ever be saleable due to lost coins, satoshis coins, coins in wallets with very small amounts not worth moving(think gift cards) and immensely strong hands.  At that number 100k a coin is very feasible within 5 years.

Ya gotta love these guys for all the hard work they put in.  Best wallet and invaluable contributors to the bitcoin ecosystem.  Always helpful when i interact on Twitter with them too

Whats lost in the debate is that Roger has had practice arguing these same bad arguments for about 4 years now.  Richard did a great job arguing all of the technical downside(centralization, latency) to big blocks.  Also, BCH is an attack on the bitcoin network for those uninitiated, and we should all treat it as a legitimate threat, as it stole almost half our hashpower in spite of it only having a couple(who are they? Nobody knows) devs, no hype, a 20% premine, and everybody dumping on it to get free btc.  BCH is very possibly state funded

I don't think anybody has a precise number of nodes.  Either way we need to make it more known that owning bitcoin entails running a full node.  This is very critical and most don't understand or are not told to

do not use coinbase.  its a trash service with trash customer service.  learn how to use localbitcoins or use cex.io or even kraken is better

bitcoin is essentially digital gold right now.  it's a new asset class that you hold to store long term wealth.  it's a very secure and permissionless digital gold that gives the owner complete ownership and ability to verify that they own it.  you dont buy things with gold
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:22:03
bitcoin goes to 8 decimal places so we are good.  we just have to start referring bitcoin as millibits.  the community is still coming to a consensus on lexicon
@_date: 2017-11-01 04:38:25
He's talking about price. As in should he buy now.  Adoption doesnt drive price.   Anyway my answer is yes.  Buy bitcoin, go with your gut you know its the smart thing to do.  And once you buy then run a full node and get a hardware wallet and secure it properly

Thanks for the explanation.  I have found the barrier to entry to be high.  I guess any sort of savvy customer could withdrawal funds from your wallet to theirs so using your wallet is good for noobs.  I would caution anybody against using a wallet that hasnt acheived community consensus and testing though.  Good luck though and thanks

- what does this even mean lol.  Centralization pressure?
- we are a long way from the 21 million coin cap being a point of contention.
- more hyperbole without any explanation.  Bitcoin is and has been constantly under social engineering attacks and is currently crushing souls in terms of innovation, price and interest
- more retardation, so the smartest computer science people in the world have been coding and attacking bitcoin and still haven't cracked it.  This is actually the least concerning thing about bitcoin
-bitcoin isn't going to usurp fiat currency anytime soon, all the scaling solutions we need are on the way and being worked on.  If you weren't what i presume to be over 50 years old you would probably know about these improvements

Opendime is a great way of creating an airgapped private key. 
Also buying a cheap android phone and never connecting it to the internet and turning off data and wifi then installing a wallet via sd card works.  Then you have a paper wallet that you can have the seed words too but also a pin code on the phone.  Easier to spend when needed too

I would travel to another country and cash out bitcoin to local currency(Japan, Korea) from there I would open an offshore account and deposit the money in there.  Come back and the us gov will have no idea u did this.  Also I would have a really good time in Japan or Korea with my riches.  Also if u need to make a charitable bitcoin donation as a tax exempt move then i will send u my address.  Gl

No.  That is not an issue.  Bitcoin still worked the way it was intended with the same incentive structure 
@_date: 2018-04-18 23:07:50
currency is just one use case of bitcoin.  you could argue bitcoin's blockchain is the only verifiable objective truth we have on earth.  if for a couple months it was expensive for somebody to permanently scribe the truth onto the chain then that's how it is.  it still worked just fine.
