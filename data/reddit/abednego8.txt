This deserves more attention.

So basically the guy tried to question the government. The government then pulled a ton of contracts from his company that lowered their revenue/income. Then the government charges him for insider trading saying he had "inflated expectations" based on those contracts. He was sentenced to six years in prison. That's scary stuff....

Not exactly, the fans consume some of energy to keep the setup cool (mine has two fans at 40W each). You are right though in that a higher percentage of the energy is converted to heat. I don't think people capitalize on this enough.

I use an old miner to heat my garage/ManCave. It used to be heated by a space heater but I found an old miner for cheap. It generates approx 0.035 BTC per month and consumes $55 worth of electricity. If it gets REALLY cold, I can generate double this (in terms of bitcoin and heat) but I just keep it underclocked 95% of the time. It is not a modern miner but works amazing as a space heater. Only problem is it can be loud so I usually turn it off if I am tinkering in the garage. Currently 29F outside, garage is semi-insulated and the temp is 58F.

You're right, but it's an excellent replacement for a space heater in certain circumstances. Ideally you want an older miner that is really cheap with a decent hash rate. Antminer S4 @ $15 for sale at a local secondhand shop worked for me.

Basically, it is more secure than it being on your computer.

You are correct, BBC did a story on it a few days prior to gizmodo. Didn't see that.

He did say "bought" and not "invest", FWIW.
