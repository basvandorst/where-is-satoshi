Taxes in my country (Ireland) 
are huge because the banks have fucked up and then government stepped in and bailed these gobshites out, making everyone in the country pay for it and plunging us into a deep depression for the 8th year running now (tho there is a light at end of tunnel now it seems)
Speaking of companies "fleeing" plenty of them flee from US to here to launder money onto Bermuda (Google, Microsoft, Apple you name it) tho' that loophole is now closing for them, unfortunately native small companies are not able to take advantage of these loopholes since we can not afford armies of accountants and solicitors nor have bribed the government for "special treatments"
In the last 10 years me and my company have payed insane amount of money in tax and have not received any support, whats worse every year the screws get tightened more tightly and more taxes are introduced and public services are cut, I am sick of it and I am getting old, I want to make my money now and retire in next 5-10 years altogether.

IMHO bitcoin is infinitely more useful, I can convert BTC to USD from my phone while sitting on the toilet, I can use BTC to buy products from around the world and have them delivered to my door.
Not so with the Ruble, nor do I have plans on travelling to Russia any time soon
aside: Are Moscovites still as rude as ever? Every person who lived or traveled to Russia always says how fracking rude they are, same goes for Parisians but Moscovites seem to take it to a new level.

As a merchant, I do not care whether the price is 4$, 40$ or 400$ what I do care  is whether more people actually use bitcoin since its a large saving when compared to creditcard/paypal when it comes to online payments.
I already give a substantial discount for bitcoin users since they save me so much money and more importantly hassle when it comes to fraud and chargebacks.
p.s: I was using bitcoin since 1$ / btc and have since seen multiple bubbles and busts, but what is really important is the growth of tools and ecosystem and solid businesses build around bitcoin.

Amazon specifically forbid Amazon Prime to be used for "drop-shipping" (since well .... ... it costs them money!) which is exactly what purse and their sellers do, its only a matter of time before they are told to stop or worse sued into oblivion.

Coinbase is basically using Bitcoin as wedge to become a competitor to Paypal (or be bought out by them eventually)
The only pro for coinbase is that when people ask me where they can get bitcoin easily i send them there, no one else makes it as easy most of the time to get bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-16 13:19:20
Yes there is a good reason, not everyone wants the police knocking on their door after buying something on purse from someone committing credit card fraud.
@_date: 2015-05-20 12:03:05
Ah you again, how much are they paying to shill for purse? (everyone check his comment history)
Those large discounts (not purse instant sales) are from various buyers often involved in carding and all sorts of dodgy shit
* 
* 
I want to ensure none of that happens by only accepting PHYSICAL amazon.com codes bough in cash with clear proof of cash purchase (hence no reversibility either)
I do not want to compete with carders and money launderers I think there is a clear demand for amazon products with bitcoin at a discount and a clear supply of CLEAN and SAFE physical amazon codes bought in cash from people wanting to get bitcoin anonymously.
In effect buyers would be benefiting from people who want anonymity and bitcoin, as likes of Coinbase tighten screws tighter in their quest to become a paypal 2.0 more people be driven to alternate ways of getting btc
@_date: 2015-05-16 14:03:05
The only way purse can prove it is not true is by having the sellers upload images of the giftcards they use with a cash receipt. This doesnt happen
@_date: 2015-05-19 12:55:37
I must be a Bitcoin Dinosaur so :D
@_date: 2015-05-21 09:01:12
Yes there is nothing wrong with people buying things on your wishlist and I am sure amazon are happy for more sales
Using Amazon Prime for faster shipping to you of your "gift" is against amazon prime terms and it costs them money. Amazon Prime specifically forbids goods being shipped to other people from your prime account as some sellers on purse do and as Purse Instant boasts it does.
There in lies the problem, not only Purse create a site where it makes easier for carders and fraudsters to "cash out" THEY THEMSELVES flaunt amazon rules by abusing Amazon prime

at one stage in 2012 I had a site in top 1000 with 300,000 daily visitors
it might be an apples and oranges
but blockchain.info by my estimates has 150,000 to 250,000 daily visitors and dropping (same as coinbase) tho there is a recent uptick

Been to most of the US states, great country, great people, absolutely incredible landscapes and wide open spaces to make one feel free if outdoors is your thing.
But the policing is quite a bit over the top, from the TSA to rentacops to regular police it is hard to not feel like you are a in police state, and now we nonUSians are hearing about all sort of mad stories about asset forfeture which is just daylight robery of the population by the people meant to serve and protect.
Other than that once again great country, but whole policing thing gone way too far, I suppose you just need to look at the number of "investigation" tv series such as CSI to realize how much the US is obsessed with "law and order"

I just had a wild thought
What if bitcoin wasnt the first "coin" created but the first one that was released into to the wild.
The bitcoin code is so good, there must have been earlier itterations that ran on local network of Satoshi (group of people?) before finally achieving whatever aims the programmer(s?) set out to achieve when starting coding.
I myself for example been coding a new site/system for like 9 months now, but it wont be released to public until the development goals are reached. This is fairly typical process in programming.
Here is a toast to all the proto-bitcoins :) and to Satoshi if he is reading this. Bravo!
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:30:56

The only reason i can think of getting this versus withdrawing to own bank (SEPA) and using the debit card on current account is the fact that banks seem to hate bitcoin and last thing anyone needs is to lose their banking and be blacklisted because of BTC :(

I am from Europe, had no problems booking, just make sure its expedia.COM (us version, not regional)
Few months back they stopped showing the coinbase option to nonUS ips, but i logged in via US proxy and it worked fine, hotels were paid for when I arrived, Yes it was a pain in rear and was worrying turn for Expedia, probably some noob working there only thinks people in USA can use coinbase and/or doesnt understand bitcoin.
But if booking.com add bitcoin option I will consider looking at them again, until then its Expedia for all hotel bookings all the way. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:06:17
Ok fair enough (Tho that would not fly in other EU countries like here in Ireland where company information needs to be clearly displayed) but look at it from the end users perspective
A site asking to get paid in irreversible cryptocurrency and also requires uploading of identification documents (passport!) has no business/vat etc listed anywhere on the site.
I would love to use your service but its asking alot from users while offering little information in return.

sounds too good to be true... is it a way for them to collect credit card details?

Amazon giftcards are the favourites of carders since Amazon still to this day has lax security nor implements Verified by Visa or Mastercard 3rd secure
so they buy stolen cards in bulk, get giftcards, buy things for those on purse and get paid with bitcoin, purse.io is a carders wet dream. By time chargeback is done or breach discovered they have made their bitcoin and move on, amazon usually endsup hold the empty "purse"
If you have bitcoin burning your pocket and want amazon credit (giftcard) then go to localbitcoins.com and make an offer asking for a an image of a PHYSICAL amazon.com giftcard + a cash receipt as many do here:
And then buy yourself at amazon without having to rely on any middlemen with questionable sources of giftcards.
**You can easily save 25-30% AND remain safe**
@_date: 2015-05-20 09:16:04
You could get an amazon.com giftcard in any shop in USA then go to localbitcoins and upload image of the card + cash receipt and receive bitcoin
Completely anonymous, tho you would lose something like 20% ...
Or you can buy on Coinbase or Circle and lose like 1% but no anonymity...
The choices are definitely there

Ah I see it changed now, pity, anyways my point still stands plenty of profit to be made laundering and carding.
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:09:03
Answer a simple question why would anyone use Transferwise if they could just use bitcoin? The only reason I am using them now is because the receiver doesnt (yet) accept bitcoin for example.
Bitcoin is very much a threat to a business like that since it makes middlemen like them obsolete. 
They might have tried to spin it and put a happy face in their blog post so as not to anger bitcoiners and appear as  eejits, but my point still stands bitcoin makes Transferwise obsolete just like a car made horses obsolete for transport.
@_date: 2015-04-16 08:12:59
Their support seems non existent, sent them a simple question about how to use their site which shouldnt have taken more than a few minutes of their time to answer
its a bad sign, they seemed to have resigned themselves to failure
@_date: 2015-04-29 12:54:46
Dont do it, they do not want bitcoin users and will close your account and probably end in tears

It could be something else actually since credit card fraudsters don't last this long as he did.
Let's say you have tainted btc ( lets say like bitstamp heist coins) you can't withdraw them but you could go shopping on gyft for acg then sell that back for clean btc
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:25:47
Same bank as Transferwise uses
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:22:34
That is the same Bank that Transferwise (who are bitcoin hostile) uses
@_date: 2015-04-07 12:38:01
That may be so but why would Bitpay potentially expose themselves to a money laundering situation where the merchant and their system is hidden from the enduser. Currently when one pays with bitpay checkout both the merchant and bitpay themselves (by the invoice page being served from their domain) are clearly visible (bitpay may very well make no money just to get their brand out there), this will not be the case with a "tap payment"
It would be interesting to get Bitpay's reaction to this since it is using (or claiming to) their system in a way i suspect it was not designed, nor potentially wanted since it actually helps their competitor (mastercard) at their expense.
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:55:14

Also from Ireland, one already can buy booze with bitcoin (trust a Paddy to know :D) by getting an amazon.co.uk voucher at giftoff.com (previously pock.io) and then ordering drinks at Amazon.co.uk, some of the sellers there such as WineCellar have some rare drinks and you get next day delivery to here with UPS in very well sealed and secure packaging so the bottles dont get damaged.

Ouch, good thing i withdrew the 200eur yesterday evening i put in with bitcoin a week ago.
I can not believe I had to jump thru so many hoops to setup and account and card with them only for them to do this, fuck neteller.

Let me explain 
The FED created trillions of dollars into existence as part of its various "quantitative easing" programs all this money ended up at first propping and then inflating the stock market (and all sorts of other asset markets) into absurdity (all those companies whose PE ratios simply do not make sense in traditional stock market formulas for example)
So now some of this "easy" money is going to flow into bitcoin and hence inflating this asset as well
Satoshi (I am assuming he is dead) must be spinning in his grave in light of his philosophy and message in respect to QE

2. Sell to suckers who do not know about gyft at 5% off
3. keep 1% difference as profit
+give further legitimacy and popularity to a carding + money laundering platform that purse really is.
its a win win...
@_date: 2015-04-29 10:28:51
That might explain why same bank is being used (same contacts at both)
Anyways here is Transferwise position on bitcoin
tl:dr: its a threat to them for various reasons
But yeh I use transferwise to send to US for my company, since the supplier doesnt (yet :( ) accept bitcoin despite me asking, the bank Transferwise ask to send the EUR is the one above, hence i noticed the similarity
Now if my supplier ever switches to accepting bitcoin there be no need for damned fees :(

This here ^^^
As a longtime bitcoin user (i remember being a curious nerd and buying first ones at 3$ a pop, ah bless) i have seen the value of bitcoin against dollar/eur go from 1 digit to 4 digit and fall right thru last year to low 3 digits
Hell even the dodgiest of retirement investments are not a rollercoaster like this!
What I done instead was to use more bitcoin for my business over the years and tell as many people about it who would care, use it almost daily to buy anything from hotel tickets to dog food on amazon :D if anything bitcoins volatility makes bitcoin like hot potato since there is a constant (use it or lose it thought when prices are flat and constantly falling)
For long term investment I am getting into rental property this month, pitty could not use bitcoin for the purchase...
tl.dr: the only way to ensure that bitcoin is around in long time is not to sit on them quietly but get more people to use them, it would be much harder to ban something used by loads of people worldwide than ban some obscure nerdy technology which sadly has been tarred by the media as mostly of use for black shit
@_date: 2015-03-28 13:44:26

VPS is a virtual server, used in hosting, where one can host sites, voip, gaming and so on
Services like gyft.com allow you to purchase for example amazon.com giftcards and save 6%, if you had cash you can only buy giftcards on 1:1 basis (and have to be located in US), this is quite cool since amazon have a large selection, deliver to alot of countries and the saving is nice
