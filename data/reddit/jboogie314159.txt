I use the Blockfolio app to keep track of my various cryptos and what my gains are. You can enter how much you purchased of each and for what value.

It was a black frog ATM if you want to look up specifics but they required that I either scan a government ID or put in my phone number and get a verification code to type in. Over a certain sized order, they only accept ID

While hodling is a great way to profit with bitcoin, it's important to recognize that a large part of what's driving up the price is trade and adoption. Since the supply of BTC is finite, demand is what drives the price. Everyone should try to use BTC for small transactions here and there with vendors that accept it, like Subway. This occasional small spending will encourage circulation. Circulation is important to draw attention to the value of the technology. If more large businesses gain interest in the value of BTC, it would have a pretty good chance at going up wildly in value while also becoming a universally recognized safe alternative to banks. So I would say the rule to maximizing BTC's success should be more specifically "hodl a lot and spedn a little".

Well coinbase will charge you a ton, that's not BTC's fault. The BTC fees are pretty high at the moment but when segwit activates it should go down a good deal

For those with BTC on August 1st, will BCC just appear in their wallet that day? Will it look like BTC or will the wallets have to update to hold this alt coin?
