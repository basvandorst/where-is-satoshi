I did not click on any email.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:46:35
I believe the email to be real.
I posted it in its entirety here.
I am hopeful that they can reverse it, they put in a line.
I have 2fa enbabled.
I believe the email to be real, it reflects a real amount in my account. There are no links in the email.

Left voicemails.
