L^2=4Dt come to mind for me. Also threshold phenomenon and the band wagon effect of Platform economics comes to mind. I'm drunk so maybe someone else can explain this. We need like 3% of the population using Bitcoin for it to take off. But I'm totally biased and I believe this technology is just too disruptive to not take off. Kind of like the switch from horses to cars. It happened within a decade and a half I believe. I feel like Alan Shepard when he had to pee in his space suit waiting for launch.

My colleagues at work all laugh at me behind my back. They think I'm insane and that I'm getting scammed. I don't care , because when the price really gets rolling I'm going to be the richest motherfucker they ever met in their lives. Their reluctance to learn and get on board now just creates opportunity for me. My children get it. They have asked me who is getting the bitcoins when I die. Why would they want something that is worthless?

Thanks for clarifying your comment for us all. You just made my point stronger. If the amount of energy used for 1 Bitcoin transaction truly uses the equivalent amount of energy that powers 32 households then the demand for Bitcoin is being demonstrated. 
Also, if it really cost that much to make a transaction don't you think it would be reflected in the cost to do the transaction? The miners are in the mining business to make money, not give it away.
@_date: 2018-08-13 02:19:49
The honey badger don't care.

Much coin! Revolution!
@_date: 2018-08-11 18:23:23
Miners that make their own equipment pay a fraction of the cost that retail buyers pay. With lower cost, miners can afford to add more machines to the network and it's a pretty good gamble that the price of Bitcoin will go up.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:55:28
I can only guess. If you consider that today there is 1800 BTC mined a day worth about ~11.5 million dollars. Also if you look far off into the future to the year 2060 when less than one Bitcoin is mined a day for the entire planet, if energy cost don't become free, if no coins are lost, if the price just keeps up with the cost to mine, it's not had to imagine 1 BTC being worth what it cost to mine a days worth now. Actually it's not hard to imagine the price being much higher.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:32:44

I have a hard time believing rates will get better. The ATM owners are selling coins with no KYC being enforced. That by itself is worth paying 20% more for Bitcoin.

Why 6k? May as well go to 6 bucks with that logic. What bugs me is people talking about support and resistance like they are real. What really decides the price is the ratio of supply to demand and nothing else.

@_date: 2016-03-02 19:39:23
With the supply getting choked off at the halvening I can only imagine miners will be forced to hold on to coins until the price goes up. The only reason I shut my cointerra machine off was because my wife kicked me out of the house, not because it was unprofitable. Heck, if the price was to go high enough I would find a place to plug it back in!

Dollar cost averaging works when you buy small amounts at regular intervals over a period of time. Bitcoin is my savings and I have been buying since 2013.

What in the world were you thinking going into a bathroom with people you don't know to do a transaction like that? Use a coffee shop in public. Transact at a table. After counting the fiat the fiat envelope stays in front of you on the table the whole time while waiting for confirmations. Then you put the envelope in your pocket and promptly leave.

For the love of all that's good, do not tell her and as recommended below, DO NOT TELL A LAWYER! The less they know the better. I know from experience first hand. I was married for almost 2 decades and it meant nothing to my now ex-wife. Sleep good at night knowing that you have a nice nest egg in case the two of you ever need it. Seriously? Tell a lawyer?? That is so stupid! They are the biggest thieves alive! That advice just makes me angry and shame on the people giving it. Find a relative or friend that you seriously trust with your life and instruct them on what you want done in case you die. Hopefully someday we can make smart contracts to take care of these things without having to trust someone else so much. If this is already possible, some guidance would be great.  
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:32:10
Here's the obvious, Most of the time when you put your fiat into a bank savings account the bank takes monthly fees whether you touch it or not. When you put your fiat into Bitcoin there are no fees until you use it. Which one is a better option?

As one poster has already mentioned, there is no savings account that will pay what inflation takes away, or they are very rare. Also, most people can't afford to keep a minimum balance in their accounts to avoid fees which is honestly a license to steal from the very people that can't afford it the most. I have traded stocks and have made money at that but I wouldn't advise anyone to trade stocks any longer now that we have something as revolutionary as Bitcoin to participate in.

What are you talking about? I have advised many people that are non-tech and new to Bitcoin to buy hardware wallets for safe storage of their Bitcoin. One person in particular just started using a smart phone! None of them had any issues and none of them had to ask me for help. Hardware wallets are some of the easiest tech I have ever used and so long as you have your seed words safe, which is an open standard you can restore your wallet on any seed compatible wallet. It doesn't get any safer than that. 
You comment is total FUD and only serves to deliberately discourage the use of Bitcoin/crypto, redditor for 3 weeks.

A 51% attack is completely impractical for a miner to try and pull off.

I'm an atheist so I'm willing to take some bad with the good. People with opposing views don't threaten me in the slightest. It wasn't that long ago that I would have been killed for my heresy and it's still not safe for me in a lot of the world. Why would you want to change that and threaten my life for the sake of hurt feelings? It's unnerving to know that you are watching people like me. Do yourself a favor and try developing yourself as a person if you want to make the world a better place. 
@_date: 2018-11-05 12:34:38

@_date: 2018-11-15 03:12:05
There is no guarantee that the price won't drop further but you should remember that there are a lot of people with much more skin in the game than you. Bitcoin would have to be broken in some catastrophic way for it to disappear, and it is not broken. I have been through times like this and they pass. I personally buy a little more every time or I work a little harder at my job so that i don't have to sell because I needed the money. Bitcoin isn't dead, it will out live all of us reading this sub. Don't panic and do something else that you enjoy doing. Before long you will be a pro like some of us that have more experience dealing with these drops. Get some sleep. That's what I'm going to do.

So apparently over at  asking for solid evidence of Jordan Peterson actually being a bigot is not conducting yourself in a civil manner and it gets you banned. Thankfully we have Bitcoin. People should be able to speak freely and it's a good thing to have your ideas challenged. It keeps a person honest. I've come to the conclusion that the majority of people that hate on him are forming their opinions from the headlines of articles of shoddy  journalism.  They haven't spent anytime listening or reading anything he says. Free speech is important so that everyone can be free of unjust persecution.

@_date: 2019-01-29 15:10:09
Let me rephrase my question. How do you know it's completely unlikely that people won't buy up the supply of new coins? There is absolutely no way looking at the blockchain is going to reveal the spending habits of people holding old wallets or of new buyers. The market is growing and everyone knows it.
@_date: 2019-01-15 17:31:01
If that were true people won't sell BTC, they will trade it for goods and services directly. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 18:02:48
That's you opinion. It's open source and p2p so it can't be stopped. The market is small right now but in time it will over take all other currencies because the world needs it.

I rather hold Bitcoin that grows over time as my savings than fiat which is deliberately devalued by central authorities year after year. My initial purchase of Bitcoin is worth 140 times what it was when I bought. The same money in fiat would be down 20%.  Pointing out the people that bought at the top of a spike is just fear mongering. I have bought btc plenty of times and the price went down and I'm still doing fine. If you dollar cost average over time you will do well with btc. It's way riskier not buying btc right now and missing this golden opportunity than buying shitty trash fiat dollars that are deliberately turned to dust in my bank account. Not to mention I'm not charged fees to keep btc in my wallet unlike fiat which has dirty criminal bankers helping themselves to my money with criminal monthly fees. Fiat can suck my sweaty ball sack.

Bitcoin will increase in value not just from the halving every 4 years but as individuals increasingly hoard it the coins in circulation will increase in value. An individual can have all sorts of Bitcoin wealth but live like a person who has nothing. People who live day to day on Bitcoin will benefit from the increasing value of Bitcoin due to other individuals hoarding Bitcoin, possibly even being lifted out of poverty. I think in places where people are fleeing the most to Bitcoin from their weak currencies will have an advantage in the long run over places where people are complacently wealthy.

I have personally witnessed lots of people that no significant grasp of blockchain tech using Bitcoin without issues, that's enough for me. It's software and people use software all of the time without having someone show them how to use it. I was in this space long before mobile apps were even a thing and Bitcoin has never been easier, and it's cheap to use. You my friend are spreading FUD. Banks will continue to be good for lending or making other financial instruments available. Banks can create fiat but if you want Bitcoin you are going to have to either mine it, or buy it, and it's not going to be cheap by the time they get in. Take that message back to the people you are speaking for.

You may be able to recover your BCH. Just google "accidentally sent bch to btc address".
You will have to do some reading. I think it will involve the recipient sweeping the BCH from the private key that they control of the address that you sent it to? If they are using a trezor it may be pretty easy to do. It's worth looking into.
Ultimately you should trade your BCH for BTC.

It could be exactly like the tissue box you describe. Bitcoin has value because everyone that gets involved with Bitcoin are actually joining a social transparent trustless p2p network governed by opensource software that is cryptographically secured by the worlds largest network that has the sole purpose of verifying transactions made on the same network and published to an open and transparent ledger. The free market decides the value of Bitcoin compared to goods, services and other currencies, and the function of it's scarcity built into the code plays a huge part. If tissue boxes had the same design I'm sure they would be valuable also. Have a great day!
edit: The size of the network of mining computers also creates value from increased security. In order to fool the network an attacker would have to invest billions upon billions of dollars to have the brief ability to create BTC but this hostile act would be quickly discovered and rejected by the rest of the network. Sure Bitcoin could be copied because the software is opensource, but until the copy reaches the size and security of the bitcoin network they don't have a chance.

Don't fear the early adopters as they will not be the new oligarchs. Early adopters can only be an influence so long as they part with coins.

With a hard fork I would have coins on both chains and the best chain would win. I could actually make a small profit on the shit coins I end up with, so I'm pretty much protected either way. I stand to actually make more money with a hard fork than if I pull the coins out.

She knew about a good chunk of them but she thought it was a stupid idea from the start because her friends said it was a stupid idea. Thankfully we separated when the price dropped to the lowest point  during the last bear market. I gave her 50% of the cash value of the coins at that time and kept the coins. Then I took all of the settlement from the house and other assets and put it all in. I worked every hour that I could and when my car broke down I rode my bike to work for months so that I could buy more. It's allowed me to now survive and avoid having a fridge box as a home. I didn't have a great lawyer either and honestly most lawyers don't know jack shit about Bitcoin. If OP is smart he would buy all that he can now. He also shouldn't be giving her half of his check if he has custody and is supporting the child. You also can't sign away your rights.

True but when you are married honesty is the best policy. Unless you are getting fucked. It was only after I had been kicked out of the house twice that I started covering my ass.

It is very difficult to get permission to experiment with schedule 1 drugs in the United States. The studies are happening and they are promising enough to encourage further studies.
I asked you for sources and you didn't provide any links. Luckily I have watched the Matt Dillahunty debate and I think you should watch it again as I don't think you are comprehending what he is saying. I get the impression that you are cherry picking. He makes it very clear that by no mean does he think the experience is evidence of the supernatural. I think he articulated himself very well. 
 As far as Nazism being being an Atheist doctrine, a quick look on Wikipedia brings up plenty of information on the subject, didn't you take history in school? Nazis where also socialist and that's an inconvenient truth that many would like to also ignore. Don't identify with any one group too much and that includes being an Atheist.

You neglected to mention that he was talking about the mystical experience induced by magic mushrooms. I'm a militant atheist and I have eaten magic mushrooms, I get the point that he is making. You don't have to believe in the supernatural in order to have what some describe as a mystical experience. Having a mystical experience on magic mushrooms can have a lasting positive impact on a persons life. That's a good thing and it may be enough for the person to start caring for themselves like someone they love enough to quit smoking.

I apologize for being crass and thank you for clarifying your thoughts. I just don't think you can assume that miners will shut machines off if the price goes down.

 &gt; Hashrate follows price * reward
There is absolutely no written rule in the code or anywhere else that hashrate follows price times the reward. This is total bullshit.
The price is completely market driven. Right now we have more buyers than sellers with a daily supply that increases by 1800 coins, it's as simple as that. When a halving occurs every ~4years the daily supply gets cut in half which is not insignificant and can't be ignored. If miners want to mine and sell their coins to stay in business they will have to demand more for the coins that they mine. Where the price will go no one knows.
