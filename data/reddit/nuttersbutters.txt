This really is not anything new. Lets go back 300 years for a moment. For the average human on earth if the technology didn't pertain to farming, it would be considered voodoo magic.
As we move forward, more and more of technology will be understood by a smaller and smaller portion of society. With the coming of AI, this will grow exponentially to the point where no one will understand how certain elements of technology work. That's my belief, it's kinda scary. Of course if we find a way to use technology to enhance our intellectual capacity, the outcome could be very different.

Whateves, this is a non-issue. Government regulation shutting down all US exchanges. That's when I'll actually worry. There is nothing of substance here. It's just crypto being crypto.

Well they're in a sticky situation. 11.5k BCH sell orders at MARKET VALUE. The market is currently frozen. People see the current price and think they will be able to sell at that price. Not even close. 11.5k will deplete the current order book. People will have their market sell order filled as low as a couple hundred dollars, maybe even lower. It will be their own fault, but that's likely what would have happened.
I believe there is also a liquidity issue here. The whole situation is pretty much a cluster fuck.

Next difficulty adjustment is not for another 11 days. Am I missing something here?

You only lost it if you sold.

The price jumped from 16k to 19.3k in a matter of 10 minutes... you can't expect ANYONE to keep up with that kind of volume all the sudden. This is beyond anything that has ever happened before.

This is a great post.
-Call to action
-Not about price

"When the rivers run red, take the dirt road."
That's the saying for this type of market situation, right?

Yes, don't bet against bitcoin. BUT, don't take out loans to invest into any crypto space. It's bad for everyone. Invest what you can afford to lose! When you invest what you can't afford to lose, it brings tremendous pressure to sell during the rough patches. Sometimes it's not even an emotional decision to sell, but a forced decision to make a payment on that loan or some other expense. This type of behavior on a large scale is where market collapses are born!
Respect for this guy sharing, it's a valuable lesson for like minded people prone to this type of behavior.
Invest what you can afford to lose!

I do not believe it's insider trading. There are clear indicators showing an active effort to reverse the short-term upward trend. It's going to be difficult though with all the positive fundamentals right now.

You will see a large single sell off to drive the price down followed by an immediate million dollar plus sell wall established for a short period of time. During this time the person or group is hoping for sell orders to quickly re-establish in the order book. Once it does, the wall is removed as it's no longer needed to keep the price lower. Then they wait. if the market reacts with a sell-off, they got what they wanted. If not, they repeat the process until either a trend reversal occurs or they meet their financial limit. There is a lot of risk as there are often whales on the other end of the spectrum waiting for these moments to buy in. That's why it's most likely not just one person, but a group of people. It also goes both ways. This same behavior can occur with pumping. Hence, pump and dump. This is obviously a dump. There is a reason why the CFTC is offering a 30 percent reward to turn in these bad actors. Because pump and dump is real. It's been around in this space since inception and I'm not talking about the movie.

Defacing government backed currency doesn't help further legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of those we want to win over. It comes off as arrogant and standoffish. If you want to win over people, Bitcoin must be presented as supplementary currency, not replacement. One step at a time.
I already spend enough time trying to convince people the only use of Bitcoin is not to pay hackers that have taken hospitals hostage. This doesn't help adoption.

This meme would be more appropriate after a 6 month bear market at a 50% correction.

It will not always be an issue. This kind of behavior is illegal on regulated markets like the NYSE. Market cap plays a role in reducing this, but trade volume is the larger determining factor. As trade volume increases, you will see less of this. Regulation is what will truly put an end to it. Responsible and sensible regulation that is. There is good news on this front, as US lawmakers and bureaucrats seem to be serious, at least in public hearings, about instituting responsible regulation that should help this industry in the long term. Regulation is coming eventually whether people like it or not. If you're a responsible user of this technology, you should not have to worry too much. If fact, regulation is what will bring in more traditional investors and institutions since the space will be seen as more legitimate with reduced risk. It will also bring in more use cases and adaption. What we want and need is regulation that helps this industry grow, and all pointers currently indicate the majority of global lawmakers want to see this happen as well. This is a massive shift from the past five years where most regulation was essentially an attempt to kill the industry. This industry has proven itself and it's here to stay. Lawmakers see that. I'm optimistic.

Judging by your self admitted inexperience, I'd stop trying to profit off the dips unless you're simply adding to your existing position. Are you in the U.S.? Unless you're a hard core anti-fiat supporter, you need to think about taxes; shoot for that 15% long term cap gain as apposed to short term ~28-30%. You're so much better off just hodling.

This is not said enough. The truth is, reputable exchanges ARE more secure than your Windows home computer. There are so many stories of people losing everything because they xfered their coins to some seemingly malware free Windows computer hosting a wallet. Only to find out later it was infected.
It should be like this:
For small amounts, use a mobile device wallet.
Anything that you actually care if it's stolen, invest in a hardware wallet.

Is Coinbase profitable yet?
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:54:26
Let me put it this way, I've never heard of a tampered hardware wallet bought off Amazon. But this is 100% the type of question I'd research and confirm on your own, rather than trusting an idiot like myself. Personally, I'd not have much of an issue getting it off Amazon rather than waiting over a month buying direct. Others will disagree.

Please lay out your argument for S2X. I've yet to see someone in support of S2X lay out why this is the better option moving forward.

Buy a hardware wallet while you're waiting for your cap increases. Nano or Trezor. Either works great. Research both extensively so you're comfortable with the technology and process. It's very easy, but understanding why your doing it is what's important. Do it now rather than later.
