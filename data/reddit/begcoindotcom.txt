sometimes fiat is easier than BTC, sometimes BTC is easier than fiat.
 
let the market decide where its used.  if the cafe really wanted to streamline things im sure they could set up a membership system where regular customers have a card they can top up/pay online, using any currency they want but holding both fiat and BTC in a single card or app.

i still have a live usb hanging about that can dual boot to tailsOS and ubuntu for saving me after doing something stupid on windows, they both have their place for sure.
 
android is an awesome operating system as well on the mobile, integration between android and windows for work cant be beat at the moment.  some of the file sharing and remote access could maybe be more secure on a linux only system but with a linux only system i cant just hand my phone to somebody whos never seen it before and tell them what i want done with any sort of confidence.  its not just an issue with people not being familiar with the OS, i think windows is genuinely just simpler to use even for power users.
 
for home, windows 7 works as well as any purpose built apple system for integrating the computer, tv, console, sound system and whatever else i throw at it.
 
that could change if this happens -&gt;  but even then, it wont be any use if you need the power of a desktop to hand.

never used them before but would consider it if the price was fair. 
 
sadly the vast majority of these companies 'adopting' bitcoin are offering a real shitty deal in terms of exchange rate or sell nothing but overpriced junk (like overstock.com).
 
can only give them a chance i suppose, maybe im being unfair in assuming the worst.  ive just seen too many retailers thinking people with BTC to spare are retards who are not price sensitive, if something is cheaper with fiat then why use BTC?

been there, done that.
 
it doesnt like playing with half the stuff i connect windows to.
 
fuck IOS

i once tried to find something simple within linux that would act like notepad, that would remove instantly formatting of cut and pasted text, took me over an hour and even then it wasnt perfect.
 
windows 7 is the best operating system ever made, linux circle-jerkers think those of us who want an easy life are idiots.  that mentality is so retarded its almost an oxymoron.

bitcoin doesnt automatically have an advantage over other forms of exchange, it isnt the quickest or best solution for everyone.
 
spend your time looking at where exactly it does solve a problem and youll soon be able to target clients who may not even know they have one.
