Totally agree, but that didn't change overnight.

Yeah, wrong terminology. But why did sellers suddenly decide it was worth significantly less without a movement of the underlying asset?

Really cool to bring this back! It's a great use of Bitcoin!

Sorry, I get news from literally any other source than Fox.

Little bit more research.... Every share of GBTC is backed by 0.09196847 BTC... so $11750 *0.0919 = $1080. It trades at a historically high premium over the price. So this is really just a correction in the premium so far, perhaps because futures are coming online soon, and some big holders decided it was better to play in the futures market than in an OTC exchange? Only speculation.....

I'd support it if it put money back in my pocket... It doesn't. I'd support it if it didn't RAISE taxes on the academic types early in their life and careers trying to make the world a better place... It doesn't. I'd support it if I had any faith that people and companies that receive the majority of the benefit gave a fuck about the working class... I don't.
I'm well enough off that I won't financially notice the impacts. But if you think tax reform as written will make America great again, your wrong.

Tax reform.

Futures don't involve actually shorting the real bitcoin..... They can be in a short position -- as in, they benefit if price falls, but not by selling a coin that they don't own on an exchange.

Cramer is like r/wallstreetbets -- investing against his advice is a solid strategy.

Be interesting to see where it stops. Logical floor is 0.919 * BTC price.

Or selling my BTC to a pawn shop for cash.... one around here is offering cash on the spot for crypto.

I use E*Trade for banking, even though they're way more well known for stock trading. As long as you don't need brick and mortar for some weird antiquated reason, they're great. Check deposit via cell phone images, atm refunds at any ATM you use. I don't think my checking earns interest right now, but whose does?
They've also never given me trouble about Coinbase.

ahhhhh goood call! Thanks!

Every now and then I come across something that makes me realize I'm playing with more than funny internet money. I can exchange a single bitcoin for over a half pound of gold??

Didn't you mean to post "dude, delete this!"? 
Good on you for posting something actually helpful, have an upvote!

Or I am middle class, that itemizes enough so double the standard deduction does nothing.
I don't mean disrespect, I get where you're coming from... I just don't agree.
Let's just agree that you're not going to change my mind, and I'm not going to change yours. I've got better things to do.

Maybe they had 100k BTC and DID sell up and down the last bubble.

Wow, wonder what their angle is? It's not even useful or informative presented like that...
