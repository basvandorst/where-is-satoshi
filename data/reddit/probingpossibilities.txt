False equivalency. Only one of those options can end at 0 in 5 years. 
The S&amp;P has averaged 10% per years over the last 70 years. 
If this person truly is risk averse he could add margin. Say he leveraged 50% at a cost of 5%. 
10%+(10%-5%)= average of 15% per year. 
1.15^5= 2x. And guess what 2 times 500,000 is? 
On average you can double your money in the market with leverage every 5 years (without risking a full loss unlike bitcoin).

So if that’s the case how will you get new hodlers to support your vulnerable price?

Yes but the logic doesn’t follow. You were telling him not to sell because you believe bitcoin will go up. Instead he got hacked. 
Now you’re here claiming you told him not to sell (as if you knew something ahead of time). 
But hey if you sold your bitcoin at that time and bought now you would be positive ;).

Did you start with 10 coins?

Are you thick or just stupid? 4% vs more than 50%

I guess you should know what you’re getting into when you trade in unregulated markets.

Well, first off inflation is 2.1%. Also, you’re math is wrong. Would be closer to $5
With the correct inflation after 100 years $100 would be worth $11.97. Hardly anything to panic about if you invest money you’re not using.
