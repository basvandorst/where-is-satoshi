Wozniak cashed out his crypto though.
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:37:49
You seem to be doing a lot of assuming.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:38:28
There is a rather large difference between 2% inflation and the hyperinflation of Zimbabwe.
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:19:21
Of course the question becomes if a deflationary currency is actually superior to an inflationary one. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:46:52
Do you seriously believe bitcoin is not experiencing a bubble right now?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:33:07
Evidence is what Tether is actively avoiding by dissolving the audit....
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:46:38
Cool, until you realize it only takes one real crash.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:21:39
Ohw the horror of discussion on a discussion medium!
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:17:06
So if a Nigerian prince offers to sell dollar tokens backed by his great inheritance you are going to jump right in?
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:16:52
Rather easy to just proclaim every dissenting opinion as attention seeking isn't it?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:38:38
And if you don't believe that you can just check for yourself that Friedman LLP has removed Tether from its client list.
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:34:33
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:40:49
It's a bubble.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:45:54
But bitcoin is not the internet. It's like saying the segway must become a success because the car was a success.
It is not the same thing. 
Why would bitcoin become the transaction system we use when even its descendant crypto currencies have better performance? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:14:20
Imagine a market with only a 100% crash after a 10,000% gain! Best investment ever!
@_date: 2018-01-17 09:45:24
The real reason is that bitcoin is in a huge bubble and the value is mostly determined by hordes of people that think "IT CAN ONLY GO UUUUUUUUUUP"
@_date: 2018-01-19 11:08:29
The current pattern has an awful lot in common with the "bubble" pattern.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:31:36
You COULD try arguing substance for a change.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:34:18
I have to proof Tether dissolved their audit?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:12:32
The fuck, you can now issue over 2 billion worth of dollar tokens and claim it is the other persons job to proof it is NOT backed?
Issuing dollar tokens without positive proof of backing is absolute bullshit.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:30:28
So if I pinky swear I am not a Nigerian Prince you are going to trust me with 2 billion dollars in exchange for some tokens?
Seriously what part about requiring positive proof don't you understand? Literally anyone can print fake dollar tokens if your proof of burden is "proof it isn't backed"
They just failed to to an audit, why would you dissolve an audit if you have your books in order?
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:44:16
Ok you convinced me, not doing an audit is not a red flag at all, nope.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:02:26
But it has probably been a bubble since 3k. You CAN make profit of a bubble, but its unpredictability is one of its core aspects.
The only value bitcoin holds is as a means of transaction and it isn't a particular convenient system compared to the alternatives.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:10:49
I doesn't have to be a scam to be a bubble....
@_date: 2018-01-17 11:31:28
But this inflation promotes the spending of money and thus encourages economic growth.
While deflation encourages hoarding and speculation.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:20:00
Bubbles are unpredictable by nature, nobody can predict when it is going to burst.
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:48:04
Most economist consider mild inflation to be a desired economic effect. But I do not have enough expertise to contest the fact.
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:49:23
Yes having the option of physically transferring money is very convenient in certain situations.
But a lot of transactions are already digital anyway.
@_date: 2018-09-22 10:33:20
Good. Fuck him. 
This is not a case of freedom of speech, this is a case of criminal harassment of people who lost their children.
@_date: 2018-09-22 15:45:36
I am perfectly aware of what you are referring to.
Targetted harassment is not part of freedom of speech.
@_date: 2018-09-22 10:33:48
Fuck Alex Jones.
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:14:25
He wasn't wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:12:32
Top right guy wasn't wrong, he predicted the .com bubble.
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:37:03
Here in the EU you just transfer the money from your bank account to theirs.....
@_date: 2018-10-13 12:03:05
Duh, plausible deniability is the entire point of laundering money.
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:45:25
The "USD" on bitfinex is actually USDT. It is tether that is going down, not bitcoin going up.
@_date: 2018-06-20 16:24:34
This is just the information of the document itself. If posting that information makes someone a troll then tether itself is one.....
@_date: 2018-06-20 13:43:38
I mean come on:

@_date: 2018-06-13 14:09:14
I thought bitcoin was supposed to facilitate trade without having a trusted third party...... 
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:21:00
I don't know if you realize, but Bitfinix/tether IS a shady bank.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:25:11
Not really, since he posted this bitcoin dropped another 7%.
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:11:10
Which is why it is a bad idea with personal money?
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:24:54
In the 7 hours since you posted this bitcoin has lost another 7% in value.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:33:55
You buy drugs of someone else, but those drugs still come from drug cartels. You are still sponsoring murdering drug cartels in Mexico and Colombia.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:10:12
For one thing the fact that you are sponsoring drug cartels.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:52:32
Creating a huge market in illegal drugs should be.
@_date: 2018-03-13 21:28:39
Farmville doesn't have an exchange for farmbucks to fiat and games that do have that conversion should comply just as crypto does.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:09:13
Anyway, how is your sex life?
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:09:07
Lol, bottom.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:23:59


Try again
@_date: 2018-03-27 16:06:05
Come on, you buy a Bitcoin license plate and don't put it on a Lambo?
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:06:58
Finally a decent prediction.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:49:21
I am a proponent of a lot of drug legalisation. However that is not the current situation and the drug cartels are horrible scum that are not getting a penny of my money and I despise everyone that sponsors or facilitates those assholes.
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:05:19
More supply leads to lower prices, not higher.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:33:37
Some people are still in the denial phase it seems.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:28:39
HOW DARE YOU CALL BITCOIN "BCASH" WHILE YOU CALL BITCOIN CORE "BITCOIN".
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:28:38
But why would I care that it is owned by nobody? I have sent money over the internet hundreds of times without crypto.  
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:28:21
Before the crash:
A: "Yo this thing is showing signs of a bubble, it might not be smart to invest"
B: "Lol noob, what do you know, normal financial laws don't apply to me. You are going to feel the FOMO.
After the crash:
A: "Yup bubble after all"
B: "WHY YOU SO MEAN TO ME, YOU MUST ENJOY BEING A HORRIBLE PERSON"
@_date: 2018-03-13 12:43:55
Posts like this are so dumb.
Do you also go to the Casino and go "If I put all my money on consecutively number 16, 20, 7 at the roulette I would be a millionaire"
Choices can only be made with the information that is available at the time.
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:01:25
I didn't invest in crypto so I feel just fine. Busy finishing my masters degree.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:59:22
So basically you want r/bitcoin to be a subreddit where everyone tells you what you want to hear.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:05:01
Yes, fees are lower now, but they reached as high as $30 per transaction and there is no reason why this wouldn't happen again if traffic increases. Also multiple businesses abandoning the use of bitcoin because of it is just a fact.
@_date: 2018-03-05 16:12:16
The link isn't even working.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:41:10
Yes lets make a subreddit where people will only say what you want to hear.
And these "retards" have been warning for signs of a bubble long before the price tanked.
@_date: 2018-03-10 16:16:32
They have above 100% efficiency because they move heat, not just generate it. The outside gets colder if you use a heat pump.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:26:58
"consider" is a rather vague term.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:38:15
Before bitcoin dropping 66% again.....
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:46:32
Ohw I am am a proponent of a lot of drug legalisation. However now that isn't the case and you having a good time on drugs comes at the expense of people getting murdered in Mexico and Southern America.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:01:30
When you buy them on Silk Road of course. Don't pretend the majority of drugs on there are from small time growers without any affiliation to cartels. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:16:53
Seriously why are there so many of these crap prediction threads?
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:41:24
Why wouldn't an OTC impact the market just as much? Demand has to come from somewhere.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:26:32
It's true, nothing makes either fork the "real" bitcoin. The only thing deciding that is consensus among the users.
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:01:47
So what? Half the people I know have an ING bank account. That doesn't mean I am lending them 2 billion dollars
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:58:33
I can't say the government taking my money is an occurrence I find particularly likely.
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:53:44
No, he took power of the drug cartels and gave it to himself.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:32:39
But is "ethereum classic" ethereum?
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:40:22
It dropped 15% in a day and people think the bottom is near?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:30:41
Well let's not pretend that being born under unfavourable circumstances doesn't help.
Some people are born with parents who give them millions, while others in third world countries have to work 80 hours a week for a dollar a day.
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:12:00
I think the purchasing power of bitcoin decreasing should matter a lot to the people who actually want to use it as a currency....
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:40:03
On a more serious note, a deflationary currency is always going to be more volatile than an inflationary one. This is because deflation drives speculation and hoarding, while inflation promotes spending.
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:11:23
Fuck the guy. He didn't take power from drug cartels, he only made their work easier while taking a piece of the profit himself.
@_date: 2018-03-05 14:40:22
geez, who would have thought laundering money would be illegal.
@_date: 2018-07-11 19:38:10
By introducing other shitty middlemen called exchanges?
@_date: 2018-07-21 20:46:56
But the triangles!
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:30:38
You are seriously going to pretend that drugs aren't fabricated by drug cartels?
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:37:37
India crashed it so hard that it retroactively caused the value loss of the last month!
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:35:13
Is there information about whether this kid sold or held?
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:56:32
So you are one of those people that judge an argument on who said it instead of its actual contents.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:50:58
Seriously, why ARE there so many of these crap prediction threads?
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:46:18
The bottom today.
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:45:57
Smuggle drugs.
@_date: 2018-04-22 21:12:47
They just hide them in storerooms.
@_date: 2018-04-16 11:30:20
Provide this other use then.
@_date: 2018-04-16 09:44:37
I am rather disappointed that the top answer is something that is almost guaranteed to lose you money.....
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:02:58
So.......to circulate at a later time.
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:56:22


Bitcoin seems to be rather bad at actually circulating.
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:09:52
What does this have to do with bitcoin.....
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:40:14
Ohw the cringe.
@_date: 2018-04-16 08:10:14
that's money's only use.....
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:20:35
I am going to say this was a good decision. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:09:42
Lol.
