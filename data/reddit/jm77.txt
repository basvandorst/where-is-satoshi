Article aside, I really do remember people talking about PayPal the way they talk about bitcoin now.
Back in the day, sending "e-money" was something only crazy people did.

This would be wonderful, but the incentive to defraud the system is too great.
Hence the current state of political systems in the world today.
@_date: 2014-12-23 02:59:32
No, no, no.
You might as well be leaving them tips in euros or in rare Magic the Gathering cards. I get where you're coming from, but your personal bitcoin crusade isn't really helping anyone.
Please just leave a normal tip in the appropriate fiat currency and perhaps find a better way to evangelize bitcoin. This is not the right way to do it IMHO and you're likely just alienating/annoying people.

Just wanted to pop in and thank you for work on this! If anything's going to help get bitcoin into the mainstream, I'm willing to bet it's American football! =)
Keep up the great work

I'm not sure how I feel about this. I support mainstream acceptance of crypto, but I'm very mixed about Coinbase.
Good for crypto and acceptance, I suppose.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:27:42
Question: how'd you convert it to fiat, or did someone wire it for you?
Basically I'm curious how people convert larger amounts safely. I see a lot of horror stories about Coinbase so I'm curious how others do this.

NP! Don't get me wrong, I love Jefferson. He was an amazing dude.
@_date: 2013-12-06 07:39:20
Let us remind our readers that he opposed derivative regulation.
He is also named in Time Magazine as one of the "25 People to Blame for the Financial Crisis"
That is all.
edit: he is also a living mummy
edit  mummies can't check their own e-mail, much less understand bitcoin

The other day, I went back in time and met a guy from the 4th century.
I told him that one day, I would sit in front of a glowing box for eight hours a day. By doing that, I would then be able to control a piece of land, secure a permanent shelter with countless amenities, offer food and education to my family, etc. all basically without touching a piece of gold or killing a single person. 
Mostly, I would wave around a piece of plastic with a little magnetic strip and voila people give me things.
He totally called bullshit, but I was like, "nah, for real though".

I wouldn't give them any information. Ask them to submit their request for information in writing and if they have a problem with that, let them know you're ready to move your account because /they work for you/, not vice-versa.
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:51:23
A+ 10/10 would chuckle again
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:29:26
Ask them to define:
 * Quantitative easing
 * Fiat Currency
 * Why the Federal Reserve system exists and who controls it
 * Inflation
 * Gold standard
 * How credit score is calculated
At that point, they can tell you what's what with money. You'd be surprised how many people seem convinced they know what "money" really is and how it works, but honestly have no idea. Bitcoin/cryptocurrency is very new, and may not mean anything for 5-25 years - and may not even exist in it's current form someday, but it's very clearly the next step in civilization's monetary evolution.
