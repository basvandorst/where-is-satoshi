Russia and Russia supporting Ukrainian separatists have been documented for a long while as using Bitcoin for money laundering as a lot of their money can't be claimed under the Magintsky act. Anyone applauding these actions and people are being ignorant.

Bitcoin is Russia's number one method right now of laundering money too, there's a reason the Kremlin is so pro-Bitcoin.

Is "legacy media" your guys' new "deep state"?

They're probably crypto because it is an easy way to launder money that is otherwise under sanctions as a result of the Maginstky Act. People on this sub have been jerking off on Russia's increasing adoption and utilization of crypto while ignoring the fact the country is currently a Mafia state.

Most of it was shitty computer simulation. While Putin continues to piss away money on nukes that can reach Mach 20 ( while the U.S has had nukes since the 1970s capable of reaching Mach 24), his people starve and suffer in a mob controlled state. He wants to revive the arms race as it's great sustenance for the nationalism any authoritarian requires so as to not be torn apart by their countrymen. I'm all for cheering on adoption of crypto, but it's not technology Russia is utilizing because they enjoy the premise of it, it is so they can move around and use sanctioned funds.

Russia loves Bitcoin as it's easy money laundering. Magnitsky Act makes it hard for the well off in Russia to move their money around.

Their leader just abolished term limits and his party's "anti-corruption" purge was more of an anti-competition purge. China is very much an authoritarian stomping ground.

Putin's government has had their eyes on crypto for a long while as it's an easy way for them to launder money they wouldn't normally be able to under the Maginstky Act, that pesky piece of American legislation that bars Putin and his buddies from keeping their I'll gotten money. This sub comes off as no surprise about lavishing praise on Putin given what we know about Russian disinformation campaigns and weaponizing the internet.

Get this drunken sack of alt right shit off of here. What is with this sub and the recent influx of alt right content? Similar stuff has been happening in r/wallstreetbets, r/crypto, and other financial subs.

Ross also tried to hire a hitman however. I agree non violent drug offenders have no business being in federal prison but Ross was looking into having someone possibly killed.

Lot of folk sucking off the Russian dictator in these threads lately.

That's actually a pretty common disinformation tactic used online right now. People come on, say " Don't get me wrong I'm not a Peterson fan/Trump fan/ Musk fan/Rogan fan etc " then provide a list of things that clearly shows they are a follower. It attempts to sound unbiased, but is a form of both sides-ism.

Lol @ Peterson. He's like the Canadian Ben Carson. Great at their occupation ( neurosurgery and psychology), terrible at public policy, politics, and public life
