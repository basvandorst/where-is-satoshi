I have the nice lighted switch without? Could use the safe shutdown though, was thinking of getting a ups for my Synology and set it up as a ups server because I have a corrupted hard drive right now. This probably is cheaper..

I have been playing and my node had a hdd failure and now I am in the process of recovering it and syncing to the blockchain which is going to take weeks. Ánd I’m impatient.
@_date: 2019-11-12 10:51:22
If you weren't running pruned you could maybe add a lightning node to the sbc..
@_date: 2019-11-03 17:55:43
Will this be a way for me to recover my funds using SCB without having to wait two weeks for my node to be synced after hdd failure?

Tip on your UFW rules: Enable SSH for local lan only with 'ufw allow from [192.168.0.0/24]( to any port 22 comment 'allow SSH from local LAN''
Do check the IP because my subnet is 1.0/24 and I locked myself out once.
Now you have SSH open to the world.

After disabling swap performance did go up a bit but now back to 0,10%. This way it will take ages to catch up. Do you have any clues where to look for better performance?

POS lightning nodes don’t need outgoing channels..

SS: I almost always use software in English, but for some reason I had Bitcoin Core installed in my native language and saw some flaws in the translation. Via Transifex I now fixed a few errors and translated some new lines for 0.19.x. This might help adoption in your home country!
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:16:54
Case is great, use it for my node as well. Why the power conditioner?
@_date: 2019-11-30 23:54:41
Now I remember why I didn't use the X735. It doesn't power the hdd, so you'll still end up with corrupted files, right? Did you test this?
@_date: 2019-11-01 21:12:55
Oh crap, that is something I would have loved to know before..xD
@_date: 2019-11-11 16:45:52
True, but it doesn’t need it and won’t use it so this capacity will always be limited and temporary.
@_date: 2019-11-29 07:14:43
Have you been greedy with setting the fee?
@_date: 2019-11-29 10:56:56
You’re the one being awesome!
@_date: 2019-11-11 19:38:19
Yes please
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:03:27
How did you pay?
Where was it?
@_date: 2019-11-11 14:33:19
'should sent the site x.xx BTC'... NO.
@_date: 2019-11-01 17:11:17
Thanks! 
Do you also know a way to pick up the reindexing where he left in stead of starting all over?

What’s the difference between the momentary switch and the latching switch? Momentary is included in the case right?
@_date: 2019-08-15 18:25:23
It’s a book.

I use Zap wallet with my own lightning node, works great for on-chain and lightning transactions and node management.
@_date: 2019-10-16 07:52:50
Thanks again, this time it will work.

And now: bigger screen which displays QR code for deposit address? Maybe add a battery pack and you could start collecting money for charity and such.
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:50:28
I think I’ll just clone your repo and start adding my functionality and send you a PR when ready. It looks great. !lntip1000
@_date: 2019-10-22 17:31:15
It is. I was a complete noob when I first got to it. If you have any questions just ask!
!lntip 100
Let me open a channel when you have your node running and you can get those on there!
@_date: 2019-10-22 16:13:45
Try Raspibolt. (Raspibolt.com) Dynamic IP is no longer a problem for LND.

Where can I get an invite?

I'm going to do the same thing, also ordered the PaPirus and want to show balance, qr-code for deposit and node status.
@_date: 2019-10-20 21:28:29
Nice! !lntip 100
@_date: 2019-12-31 18:22:00
You don’t, Hasn’t been possible for years.
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:18:02
You need to get a lightning wallet, blue wallet on iPhone for instance.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:58:15
You just take out your phone and show the QR code, it's not like the watch is doing anything usefull.
@_date: 2019-12-17 18:56:08
No problem at all, initial download might take a while though.
@_date: 2019-12-31 20:10:16
You can set up a node and send it there, most fun. You can download a wallet and send it there, good for practice. You can buy your coffee directly via Reddit, maybe not so practical. You can give it away using the bot.
@_date: 2019-12-01 08:10:19
This OP.  Take it from someone paying back their loan now on a better regime than you will be at. If you miscalculate, you will not be owning property for a long time.

This is what we need!
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:52:08
!lntip 1000 Here’s your first. Find out how to get this in your own wallet and then decide if you want to buy more.
@_date: 2019-12-05 06:59:29
And if it goes to zero it’s 1200 down the drain, tell the whole story.

There could easily be older nodes running newer software, clickbait title.
Why would anyone run older software?
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:57:30
You keep calling it functional and a wallet, but it's just a QR code, nothing more nothing less. The QR code could read 'kiss my ass', the watch will still be functional.
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:27:45
No, it makes it something with a public key on it. Tattooing a QR on my ass wouldn’t make me a wallet, it would make me an idiot with a QR code on my ass. A wallet enables you to pay, which you can’t with the watch at least that’s how I see things.
@_date: 2019-12-07 19:17:23
How do you think this is good for the community as a whole? Say my mom just bought some bitcoin on an exchange and does get rekt by POK, Will she ever buy bitcoin again do you think?
Even if she doesn’t get rekt but someone does and it is on the news, will she buy bitcoin do you think?
Do you think at all?
@_date: 2019-12-05 07:16:49
Please don’t tell someone to time the market, you can’t, they can’t, no one can.

Not to rain on your parade but how sure are you she isn’t a victim here? I hope you asked?
@_date: 2019-12-23 21:30:18
It’s not, really. Look into it, download the software and go from there.

@_date: 2019-05-16 13:48:22
I followed the guide and installed my node. Still on testnet, now in the process of recovering after an imaginary disaster and indeed running into problems. Everyone should properly test before going main and putting real money in, not doing so is your own fault imho.
@_date: 2019-05-10 07:02:26
This. Couldn’t resist and just bought some extra but no way near enough to moon yet. Ah well, at least we’re part of it right.
