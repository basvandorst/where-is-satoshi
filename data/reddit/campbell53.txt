Well I held on to 2.4 BTC from the first sale. It was a few weeks ago when it zoomed to $20k. I thought it was genius until it crashed to $12k. My controller wanted to kill me! I held until 2 days ago when I sold 2 BTC  at original number finally. Holding .4. This is a risky deal but worth it in the long run hopefully. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:39:39
I did. And still hold it. I want to believe I'm a genius but more like lucky. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:16:40
Cool! I'm not up to bat yet dammit. Still waiting. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 10:35:34
Right (fingers crossed)!

Coins...as in plural? If so get a Ledger Nano S immediately. If it's just fractions then you're probably ok. Just know that any exchange can go down (or get hacked) and take your $

I am a Ford dealer and next week I will start accepting BTC for new Fords and Lincolns. I've reserved bitcoinford.com and my marketing company is putting the finishing touches on landing page, banners etc. Not Lamborghini but close enough for you? Edit: it's straight up BTC into a Coinbase merchant wallet just like Overstock.com.

What I've heard elsewhere it's Bcash peeps selling  BTC to prop up Bcash. But they will run out of BTC soon. If you check the charts they are moving in tandem
 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:37:57
More people wanting to buy at $15k than sell. It's like a bottom floor. For now not going lower. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:12:28
Bcash...and its slimy Bcash too. Liquidated mine yesterday. I feel cleaner.

Thanks. I'm using a merchant account at Coinbase. With their BCH shenanigans this past week and all of the shutdowns etc...I'm a little nervous to keep using them. Might have to find another exchange. But the simplicity of the deal was awesome. Can't wait for the next one.

I will say the first Pixel 2 XL phone I got was nuts. It flashed like a disco ball and had weird greyed out areas on the screen. Returned it asap and rolled the dice for a replacement (all while eyeballing the Essential phone as plan B). But the new phone is fantastic. I can't believe how much I love it. Haven't touched my Android tablet or chrome book in 4 weeks. This phone does it all. You won't be disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:08:17
I have one (typing on it now). It's the best phone I've ever had hands down. And I came from a Pixel 1. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:45:10
Your friend doesn't NEED to understand. Whether he does or doesn't won't impact his way of life. For a poor farmer in Africa...using his phone to arrange a bankless Bitcoin loan (using an Andreas story) is everything to him and his family. He WILL figure it out.

I was just wondering how this particular investment concept worked. The nuts and bolts of it I guess. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:43:28
You are severely underestimating the potential desire/need for Bitcoin. There are billions and billions of people on this planet who have probably not even heard of it yet and who could adopt it at some later date as needed. As their country currency crashes, as their totalitarian government becomes more stringent, the list is endless. You are looking at it from a fat and happy western perspective. Pretend you're a poor Kenyan farmer....as Andreas continues to refer to in his talks about the future of Bitcoin. The people who would want (need) Bitcoin is immense and there is a very small number of BTC available. The math isn't hard to do.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:52:37
I bought BTC in 2013 then forgot about them. I suggest you do the same. You won't be disappointed. And buy a Nano S. Easy peasy to use. And you can sleep knowing it's all safe and sound.

Yes. It worked perfectly. And it's gone up in my favor since. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:19:57
Can I just leave them on the legacy chain of I just plan on holding long term? Any harm in that?
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:17:31
Technically yes. But I can't tell you how it's calculated. Coin to coin is taxable. Any gain is taxable obviously.

It's criminal it takes 5 months to get BCH. They must be making a mint off of the interest. They're holding untold millions hostage.

Doing it. Not changing it. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:31:37
Marketing trick by who? It's decentralized so there's no one behind a trick (outside of Roger Ver and BCH but that's another story). Also Bitcoin is divisible to the 8th decimal (called a Satoshi). So don't think in terms of whole Bitcoins

No. Do what you can. Check out Coinseed app. They'll invest your extra change. Painless. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:10:33
How many millions of BCH are they holding since August. I'm sure they've made a mint on that.

They basically said take your business elsewhere while we fix our problems. Unfortunate but not surprising. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:31:44
I'm a customer and haven't made shit. Because they won't let me have it.  Anyone holding an asset makes interest. They are holding millions. You think they haven't exploited that? No fucking way. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:25:46
I started with Coinbase in 2013. Still use them for some things. Everyone bitches about the fees but it's really insignificant when you see how much BTC can gain. You won't remember the fees in a year. And it's way easier to maneuver than Kraken for example. Start there and you can't go wrong. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:08:26
I bought BTC in 2013 on Coinbase. Forgot about them for 4 years. Still there when I logged back on. I now have a Nano S but leaving them on CB wasn't the worst decision I've ever made. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:47:34
If you don't think they leveraged all those assets to their benefit then I don't know what to tell you. There's no way they didn't. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 02:01:23
I'm buying every week. I bought when it was $400 and I'm buying at $8k. Dollar cost average for me works out. But start now and I'm betting you won't be disappointed in 2 years.

Try the Coinseed app in a couple weeks (they're changing banks or something currently and are off the Play and Apple stores for the moment). But what they do is take your spare change. Example: if you make a $3.54 purchase they'll roll the .46 into a crypto of your choice for you. I do this as a supplement to buying BTC and alts outright. It's a pretty painless way to get involved. Like I said they should be back in a week or so.

No but I'm sure they leveraged it temporarily. There's no way they didn't. Even at $100 it's a shit ton of money to hold for 5 months.

It can't. The last Bitcoin won"t be mined for over 100 years. That is in the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 11:35:39
Don't let everyone scare you. I bought some Bitcoin in 2013 from Coinbase. I forgot about them for 4 years! Logged back in earlier this year and there they were. Safe and sound. I moved them to their vault - which feels pretty darn safe to me- then eventually moved them to a Ledger Nano S Wallet as I got more comfortable with the technology. But it would be fairly rare occurrence for you to lose them unless you broadcast log in information. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:49:19
Just went thru US customs last week. Didn't come up.

Nice. You're exactly who I would be marketing to. Plus business for me as we'd not likely sell to someone like you otherwise. One question: how did you find out or know they accept BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:15:29
I have to convert most of it back in order to pay the manufacturer. Car sales is high cost low margin. I understand that Overstock.com initially converted 90% back to fiat but now is at 50%. Their margins are much bigger I assume. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:06:47
True. Margins aren't good...and could take a bad hit if BTC crashed while I'm holding it. But I believe in the technology and want to give it a try. Thanks for your input. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:30:35
Thanks. That's a good place to start. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:52:54
That's the point. They cannot 'easily' switch. We are invested in BTC....it costs nothing to switch from My Space the FB. It would cost real money to switch from BTC to whatever alt coin. Not easy nor desirable. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:48:33
Generally speaking people won't (or won't want to) sell their BTC for a huge loss. If it goes down $50 people go nuts now. There's a very real cost associated with bailing on BTC. Unlike My Space to Facebook which was a couple key strokes. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:47:02
I think the same thing. It's really a dated coin by today's standards. Lots of others do things better, faster and cheaper. But the BTC 'brand' keeps it as top dog. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 10:45:06
Are they local to you or are you making the purchase from them at a distance because the accept BTC? Thanks for the feedback.
@_date: 2017-10-22 14:44:41
trying to time it hardly ever works. Buy now and hold. Never ever sweat the dips. I bought in in 2013 and have held ever since (granted I forgot about them for 3 years) but I learned a lesson. Buy and forget. Oh and get a Nano S. Stupid easy to work. I was intimidated but it is no big deal.

Let me sell you one and I'll ship it to you! I am a Ford dealer :-)

Depends on the state and if it's reciprocal with Michigan. If it is you pay me sales tax and Michigan pays Texas. If not the you just pay it when you register it (I'll find out). Easy peasy. I'll PM you my  email address and web site so you can see I'm legit.

Did you use BTC for any of the transaction?

Bitcoin 'economy' hasn't evolved enough for me to do business with it 100% yet. But if it gets me in the door and brings me plus business then it's a win-win for me. Sorry it doesn't meet your 'pure' BTC standards. Gotta start somewhere.

You just bought 3M Satoshis. Think of it that way.

The 'point' is that I would be a preferred place to do business with BTC holders and enthusiasts across the country thus increasing my business. And that I could hold 10% of the BTC paid to me. Not sure why you have a problem with this.

How would you suggest I go about advertising to BTC holders that I now take crypto (assuming I set it all up)? There has to be some boards, podcasts etc that would give access to people like you.

Bought $50 as a test. Works fine. Hold only. Can't send it anywhere though.

You need to do some more research. It's really not that difficult to understand. BTC bopping around on a mobile wallet is not safe. Period.

Ha..no sorry. Just American cars/trucks. And yes... Jamie Dimon does suck.

Wtf are you taking about? I'm hodling BTC personally. And Overstock started by hodling 10% which is my plan. But congratulations on making a snap assessment which is completely fucking wrong. (plus I cannot, as of now, pay the manufacturer in BTC....so I would have to convert back to fiat for that purpose). 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:32:49
Exactly. There are some estimates that say up to 30% of all mined BTC is lost. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:00:45
I kind of thought that's what I'd do. I've seen their ads on their site plus heard a crypto podcast with the dude from Overstock.com. That's who they use. But my main question is...is the worth the effort? And will the feds leave me alone?

I'm strongly considering Coinbase because I use it to purchase (not hold) crypto. And because the CEO of Overstock uses Coinbase to convert and/hold his BTC. So why reinvent the wheel.
