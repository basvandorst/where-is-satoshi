Your probably right...satoshis vision probably means nothing to anyone right now. My point is that BCH is closer to the original bitcoin created by satoishi than the bitcoin now, except that BCH is improved in terms of txs power which is why miners will switch over aswell as the original investors of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:45:00
Be prepared...its coming�� 
BCH is the original Bitcoin��
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:41:02
I think before end of this year...BUT be prepared for a major flip to BCH.�� 
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:07:54
And how does it work then?
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:58:36
I personally think very likely as BCH is actually the original Bitcoin (BTC no longer follows the oringinal satoshi vision)....BCH is the original because the code is the same except for blockchain size which was increased to 8mb. The other reason is that BCH has just undergone a hard fork to increase the speed of transaction processing which will make it more profitable for miners��
For those that are hard nosed about Bitcoin, I would encourage one to be a smart investor follow through with some due diligence and not follow the sheep off the cliff��

My brother transfered 50cents of btc in 2013...0.05BTC...its now worth approx $300USD
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:21:36
My bet it will get to the $10k mark and a flip to bitcoin cash will ocurr...bch will take over btc

I have been trading the forex markets sucessfully for the last 5 years and the ones that fail tend to be the gready investors who try to sqeeze the life out of a trade. I have no emotional attachment to bitcoin and in it purely for the investment. 
Just keep an opened mind to the possibilty. As a trader you should be prepared cuz when it happen it will probably be a flash move.����

Here is a little tidbit...without picking sides...and  I'm not sure how many people know this but when most bitcoin articles/posts refer to Koreans its not the country - North or South. The actual spelling is Coreans which are the core developers. 
The Koreans the country's have nothing to do with the trade volume.
So as i understand it, the Coreans control the code of bitcoin and obviously have big stakes in the game, however they only represent approx 5% bitcoin and they do not want to change the blocksize. The other 95% is Bitcoin Unlimited which is the group fighting for the larger block size, hence the initial fork to bitcoin cash and the other on Nov 15.  
@_date: 2017-11-03 12:31:10
Not really....the fork on Nov 15 is on Btc which is legacy bitcoin. This is a ledger fork which means an economic split of the ledger as well as the infrastructure.
The Bitcoin Cash network upgrade is going to fix the mining algo so that it is more stable. This is a technical change difficult to simplify description. But it is critical in the sense that it will improve the profitability of mining bitcoin cash.
So its no surprise to me that the market sees  Bitcoin as overpriced vs Bitcoin Cash. The Nov 15 fork has a hold on supply and so there is a squeeze on the price.
Bitcoin Cash is 8MB way higher than Bitcoin and no Segwit, faster and cheaper txs. Its top 3 market cap and has a smart, large community pushing development.
Post Nov 15 Bitcoin Cash with its new mining algo may look even more attractive as legacy Bitcoin miners have an older inflexible algo not designed to share volatile mining power.
So using your analogy....i think bch is the latest model of sony and btc is the sony walkman��

To me it looks like all those that have voted down my comments and come back with school yard replies are the ones that probably fear or are denying that this scenario is a possibility.
In my comments above i have given a sound technical explanation of why it may happen. Can i challenge someone to debate this rationally and reply with some intellect rather than telling me to suck eggs! ��
Give me a good factual arguement why this senario wont happen and not opinions? ��

Here is a reference to the term in this post....i know developers on both sides and thats there lingo they use��

Btc formed a crown reversal pattern on the daily charts 2 days ago, so was a matter of time for it to begin its fall. It will  probably go to around 3000.

Agree!! Crash would mean complete reversal.

Yes its never 100%  but it all comes down to the person doing the TA - their skills and experience!
I think a good operator can be accurate 90 - 95% of the time. I have worked with many guys that are legends at it!  Problem with most TA is that the operator doesnt have the technical experience or knowledge of how the charts truly work.
Have a look at mine and look at my past ideas, with 5 years of doing this i am no expert but i do a pretty good job...i think ��

Hi there...its a technical analysis of whats actually happening now in thr market.  The principles and strategy behind my anaylsis have been taught to me by a guy who is has 30 plus years experience in trading.
Here is a detailed explanation of what i see happening based on these principles.
Time will tell if i have correctly anaylsed this move, my track record (see past anaylsis on Tradeview for BTC) though should have some weight behind what i am expecting to see!!����

People thought i was crazy the last time i called it.!! 
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:32:11
With all due respect, if it did that it wasnt a crown reversal.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:55:33
If you actually look at my graph above...what it wants to do is touch the long term trend line.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:44:05
Totally agree!! It has to be simple and secure for the masses to come on board. 
What i mean by secure is that for your average Joe managing a wallet and storing private key seems too convoluted for someone with no IT experience.

Yes....i have been technically trading the forex for just over 5 years and at this point it has high probability....but the next 8 hours will give us confirmation if it breaks above 4500 it should go to approx 6000 or if it fails we will start to see it drop to 2500.
I would rather not see this happen....but from what i am seeing now im leaning towards it falling.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:09:40
Bitcoin is actually at a critical level...if it doesnt close past $4500 today or tommorow expect a fall to $2500

Russians would never do that...Rsnsomware is a big industry predominantly supported by tge Russians.  Ransomware needs crypto to operate!

Funny story...my brother tried getting me into bitcoin back in 2013. He setup a wallet for me and deposited what was 50cents USD or 0.05BTC back then. I completely forgot about this until the other day when i found a hard copy print out of my keys. 
Unfortunately like you i didnt get in because it seemed too hard at the time....wish i did now��
Now have a combination of crptocoins all doing well!!
