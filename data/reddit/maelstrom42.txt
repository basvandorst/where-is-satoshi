If you bought Bitcoins from an exchange, the exchange rate is what you specifically paid for it. If you traded Bitcoins with someone else for something other than fiat (you were paid in Bitcoins for a service you performed), you'll have to figure out the fair market value of what you traded for those Bitcoins.

I'm not the OP, but not too hard to figure out:
* "Initial Cost" is "Number of Bitcoins" times "Cost Per Bitcoin"
* "Current Value" needs to have some cell hidden somewhere with the current Bitcoin price; "current price" times "Number of Bitcoins"
* "Gain/Loss" is "current value" minus "initial cost"
* "Percent gain/loss" is "gain/loss" divided by "initial cost"
* Total row "Number of Bitcoins", "Initial Cost", and "current value" are all sums of prior rows. "gain/loss" and "percent gain/loss" are the same as prior rows, using the total row values.

BitMessage doesn't attach "an amount" (of currency) to the message, it attaches a proof-of-work to the message, such that an average-sized email takes a few seconds to send. It negates spam pretty effectively, since sending messages to a huge mailing list of harvested email addresses would take several seconds per address, so the ROI is quite useless to spammers.

While it's great she's learning more about cryptocurrency, is she learning about how the system works (cryptograhy, math, blockchain, p2p, preventing double-spends, etc.)? To me this looks more like "I learned how to use Coinbase" than "I understand Bitcoin". If the project were about traditional banking instead of Bitcoin and went like this, would you think it a good project?
* What is a checking account? A checking account is a digital ledger where banks keep track of your money (What are Bitcoins?)
* Objective: Can a sixth grader open a checking account, make deposits for work done, carry a balance, and use it to purchase things? (Can a sixth grader own, invest, and use Bitcoins?)
* I believe I can sign up for a click-through program where I get paid a few pennies to click banner ads, and have the payments go directly to my checking account, thereby making money by doing work with my computer (I believe I can mine Bitcoins with a USB ASICMiner Block Erupter)
* My checking account number and routing number: (My Bitcoin Wallet Address)
* My PIN Number: SECRET! (My Private Key: That's secret!!)
* Procedures:
  * Go to bank and open new account (Create Coinbase account)
  * Set up direct-deposit from ad-clicking service (Buy Bitcoins for fiat)
  * Sign up for mobile/online banking with the bank, check balance online (Go to Blockchain.info, check balance)
  * Use funds to purchase cashier's check/traveller's check (create paper wallet)
  * Get a debit card associated with the account (get a QR code of public address)
  * Use funds to make purchase online with debit card. (make purchase at overstock.com or tigerdirect.com)
While the Bitcoin way of doing it is much simpler than the established banking system, the simple act of walking down the path that companies like Coinbase have spent lots of man-hours paving to make it easy isn't really learning the system. If the project were about the traditional banking system, I'd expect to see more about topics like how does HTTPS security keep online transactions safe when using online banking? How does the magnetic stripe on debit card store and transmit your information? What do the numbers in a routing number mean? Why can you overdraw your account (where does the money to make up the difference come from)? That to me would qualify as "science" and making paths toward truly understanding the system. And the same is true since it's about Bitcoin; this is barely skimming the surface and while it shows knowledge of how to use it, it doesn't show knowledge of how it works or why it works.
EDIT: The OP posted that this project is under the subcategory of "Investigation/Research", which I guess fits if that category is intended to be the student is doing some sort of research. However, I'd think it more appropriate for a Science project subcategory of Research to be a project presenting on some research being done in the scientific community?

For capital gains/losses, don't I only need to tell them about the ones I sell? If I just buy and hold, that's not any sort of gain/loss until I buy something with them, right?
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:01:49


I agree; as I mentioned, Bitcoin makes those actions easier, but that doesn't change the fact that there is a related object (ledger) and process (creating and using an account) in the established banking system, but if she had instead based her project on that, would it qualify as a "science project"?


If I were giving a presentation on how to use Bitcoin, I agree with you; you don't need to understand the nuts and bolts in order to use it. But this is a science project. If I were watching a presentation on the (computer) science behind Reddit, I'd expect to have mentioned the source code and language used.

Have you taken a look at [bitmessage]( pretty similar, though it needs to use its own client, rather than being sent along traditional email means.
@_date: 2014-03-26 11:55:30


Ummm... That transaction does have an explicit dollar value; $10. If you claimed to be sending $10 in value to someone in Bitcoin, and they agreed, however much you sent to them you'd have to claim the exchange rate that made that amount of Bitcoins equal $10, right?

Or, if fees don't go up, and the network stays at around $4,000 split among all the miners per day, that will discourage a lot of miners, and they'll drop out. As they drop out, the difficulty decreases, and we end up with less miners. 
So, we end up with less people mining, and more people just using Bitcoin; not a problem, right?

So, if you question is "can I trust this thing", try running the same tests that Random.org runs against theirs ( and see how yours compares to them. Comparing yourself to random.org's numbers is at least apples-to-apples, since they are touting to be a "true" random number generator too.
@_date: 2013-11-04 12:26:06
If you can believe [Random.org]( is truthful about [where their numbers come from]( (atmospheric noise), and their real-time statistics pleases you that they haven't been hacked/manipulated recently, that might be an option for you.
Or, they have some decent writeups on how to test randomness, if you want to test your own method(s) of generating randomness.

FYI, one typo near the beginning of the article: you claim "You can send someone .000000001 of a bitcoin if you wanted to,". You've got one too many zeroes in there. Bitcoin only goes to 8 decimal places; one satoshi has seven zeroes in front of the one.

The secret of the holy grail, of course! And my Bitcoin paper wallets. For my needs it doesn't NEED to be anonymous, but I figured for those who are hyper-conscious about maintaining anonymity with their BTC transactions, is there a correspondingly anonymous, safe, established place to save the hardware wallets and paper wallets that inevitably come from adhering to that anonymity standard. I've thought of a geocache, though that would really be more like "bury it in my backyard", putting me closer in line with acting like a pirate than acting like a geochacher.
