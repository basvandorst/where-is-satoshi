Just tried. No luck and looks like im waiting 5 days for bitcoins now. I really dont even know. I dont see anywhere to select sending to a bitcoin adress

Alright ill have to look into how to do that. I guess bitcoin is still alright i just dont have a need for it for the time being

Thanks. I intended on using the btc for something but I ended up not needing it after I had to wait 2 weeks to clear. Just cuz I don't know exactly how trading on gemini doesn't mean I'm not bright I just never had to do anything with btc other than send it to someone's wallet.

Damn it seemed like on coinbase you could get it back in your bank account. I originally was gona spend it but now i dont need it and would like to get it in my bank account.
