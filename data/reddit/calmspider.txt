Looking at the exchange rate over the past six months, the dip is hardly noticeable. It just looks like the rate flailing around in its usual chicken-with-head-cut-off manner. There was a spike in trade volume, but it wasn't any more of a spike than what was happening all the time back during the summer.

Ha ha! You are brilliant!

Yeah, I agree with the point of the article; the recovery is a testament to the stability of the currency in the face of a well-known vendor going offline.

I find the notion of proselytizing Bitcoin to be quite silly. It's like saying to someone "Have you heard the good news of money? Let me tell you about the wonders of money and what it can do for you."

Ha ha ha rational parents! Ha ha ha! Riiiiiiight. So many nerdy kids make the mistake of thinking, "I'll just lay out this logical, complex, multi-part argument to my parents. I mean it makes perfect sense, so of course they won't interrupt me or ignore my points." Never works.

Why didn't you let any of the women be in the picture with you guys?

That was a crash? It looked like a 15% dip in an already volatile exchange rate. Maybe I'm looking at the graph wrong.

What crash, exactly? Is it a crash any time the exchange rate is not the highest it's ever been?

That sounds super stressful.
