As long as your btc are held in an address that has never been used to spend coin before, your btc are safe because no one knows the public key which is was already passed through sha256 and ripemd hashes to generate the visible public address.  Elliptic curve and sha256 would need to be cracked simultaneously in order to steal your coins.
In the meantime a majority of the community can switch algorithms in a sidechain that preserves all unspent outputs at some snapshot in time (future to get the word out).

You, sir, have a way with words, tone, and attitude that is extremely refreshing right about now.  I 100% approve of your suggestions though I know this line of thinking doesn't have high priority among the libertarian types like myself.  Thanks for writing this.

The NSA paper from 1996 on electronic cash discussed this a bit:
I believe they said their proposal would still be vulnerable to double spends until the offline transactions were brought back "online" however.  It might give some background though.

Bought only to increase bitcoin support with reddit.  Especially in places like that have apparently been deleting bitcoin news.

This is terrible idea.. unless it's relevant to the discussion there already.

Probably not a good idea to allow contracts to be written in a Turing Complete language, imho.

If they put a meaningless transaction to themselves in there, though, they wouldn't be able to efficiently asicboost-mine the empty block.

NameID which is based off of OpenID and Namecoin sounds like what you are describing though it happens automatically with demob's firefox plugin:
