Unsure why they posted the wrong machine. Seems the new's people just use google images with very little care, This machine will have the ability to buy and Sell bitcoin's in a large volume. Unsure where Stazy will be placing his machine. But I am feeling some negativity from him. Sorry we beat you to the media punch, maybe you will get lucky and have a machine somewhere before us. But be prepared, if your the fella we talked to at the coin meetup, limiting your machine to $3,000 a day will basically kill you on day one :) There's no reason we can't be friends rather than competitor's in this.

Swing by Tim Horton's and sit inside, try selling coffee you made at home for less than Tim's, see what happens. A coffee shop is not public property, so it's well within their right's to say who can and can't sell in the store.
Not to mention this guy is using the hype of the ATM to draw business.

Agreed, this is more than just ignorance, otherwise ever bank who has ever handed someone cash that was used to buy drug's is guilty. I find it hard to believe he was ignorant to this.

Well this would go ever further really, It would allow the operated in a pinch to send BTC to the machine in bulk to keep up on demand. Using another exchange or personal wallet. This, we hope to implement in ours.

I agree in charging banker's instead of jail,
To be honest, who really believes the head guy's ever goto prison? It's usually some lacky or shmuck who get's screwed and does the time.
When bank's pull crap like this I Like seeing it hit the bank's pocket book more. Make's them think twice next time.

Meet up no, but pretty sure setting up shop isn't legal :) Other wise why would any street vendor bother getting a license?

Thank you, Appreciate the response, I'm guessing e-mails were dropped or something came up as response went dead, I'll look into this.

Then maybe there was a break down in the email system, As I've looked at my emails as well and For example got a response on the 17th from Andie, I replied with the amount and a request for bill payment to be setup for my account and I never got a response?

So who are the QuadraCX guy's? That's the Co-Op figured you guy's would be partnered, why not have one exchange rather than two? :)
