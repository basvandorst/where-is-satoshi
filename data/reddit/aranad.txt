There aren't cheap VPS options with big drives , because they get the prices down by dividing the resources amongst clients. That's why dedicated servers always have TB's and VPS's always have GBs. But a dedicated server is too expensive for most people to run a bitcoin node.

True, but if it was designed better and had a nicer font it could be a goer...

Not ok. I had over 3btc stuck in Kraken that they wouldn't give me access to. I had to answer pages and pages of personal questions and have to re-submit the document many times until they finally satisfied with my answers  after about 3 months and let me withdraw my crypto. Nothing to do with fiat. Do not use exchanges that control your keys.
Golden rule: NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COIN!

Yep they locked me out of around $8K of coin until I answered all their bullshit, it had pages of stuff about what i do for a living, my main sources of income, what I use Kraken for, it even asked crap like whether I know anyone whose been accused of terrorism. This followed from my NZ bank account being closed down on me after trying to send money to Kraken (yes the bank closed my account for *sending* money to a crypto exchange).

Once it goes into dispute it always takes forever, they'll need the other party's bank statement showing that no money has arrived too.

The main reason there are less exploits is not because it's used less, it's because nearly all software is installed via the package manager so all software on the machine is kept up to date not just the OS. Just like with this recent Chrome exploit, an update came out for Ubuntu and Mint less than a day after it was announced.

No I'm still looking, eurodeniz.com look interesting, but don't know anything about them yet...

I bailed from Bitstamp years ago because they started that kind if shit. Then Kraken did the same thing to me as well last year, I had a bunch of coin in there and had to answer a huge multipage form full of personal questions like that. It took me over a month before they were satisfied with the form and gave me access to get my coin out. I've never used a centralised exchange again.

Unfortunately it's true, this is a real phenomena. I had a wire transfer blocked because many banks refuse to process funds coming from reputable business simply because they accept crypto as a payment method. For example, one transfer was blocked from [SilverBullion.com.sg]( who are one of the most reputable bullion retailers in Singapore. My bank representative said,


This also applies to nearly any online bullion retailer, such as [bullionstar.com]( [goldsilver.com]( etc because practically all of them accept crypto now. Not all banks are like this, but you have to do your homework before signing up with one these days.

Can you provide some links to examples of this happening?
And remember also that when an email says it comes "from" someone, check the reply address to be sure the reply goes back to where it says its from. Also the message source to ensure that it has valid SPF and DKIM headers that prove it's really from the domain it says it is, because anyone can send an email and set the "from" field to anything they like.

I got hit with SAR on Kraken and it took me 3 months of filling out forms about my personal life and finances before I was eventually allowed to access my coin. I learned my lesson, I don't use centralised exchanges for any significant value at all anymore - but even then I just got burned again for a small amount which I had in cryptopia. Just remember the golden rule when using exchanges: "not your keys, not your coin".
