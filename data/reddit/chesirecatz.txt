Can you elaborate?

Is there a way to decentralize the fast relay network to mitigate this problem?
@_date: 2016-04-23 10:00:29
I understand fully centralized is always the most efficient and any fully decentralized system will not outcompete so  fast relay network might never be replaced by changes to the p2p protocol. 
So even if fully decentralized is not an option might there be a way to make it more decentralized without losing to much speed?
A single person able to censor is really bad for bitcoin IMHO

Please tell me how I can do that? 
I used to be able to do all that no problem the past years.  Have not seen any side-chain or LN wallets even though the experts say LN does not need segwit to function. 
Right now I am not introducing friends to it because explaining the  unpredictable, high and fast increasing fees is not something I am willing to explain. They would laugh at me. Giving a few bucks worth for them to try it out is also in the past.

Saying something multiple times does not make it true.
Software being ready to support a change is not the same thing as endorsing the change.

Dont mistake businesses being ready for SegWit with support for it. Two very different things.

Its CSV softfork, not SewWit

The last time I used it breadwallet did not have the feature of adjusting my fee so I ended up waiting 3 hours+.

Dont believe that hardfork by core in 2017 is very likely to happen so hope you are not counting on it 
@_date: 2016-06-21 12:12:20
So now subjects are classified as toxic?
@_date: 2016-06-15 06:25:03
I think three hours between blocks is exceptional. Or does this happen often?
Do you know if Copay does have a priority setting?

That would be bad news for jewelers and coin businesses. A lot of value is stored in gold jewelry. Especially for women in big parts of the world.

Most of them seem to presume long term increasing use and addoption.
