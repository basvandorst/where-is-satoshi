Yes I understand you now.

How can you make that claim from a single photo of people holding their phones in the air. This wasn't a meshnet. They were all holding their cellphones up and singing. Like when people put their lighters in the air. It was just on ITV news here in the UK.

@_date: 2014-09-30 22:16:06
Maybe a source to the news reports you mentioned would be more relevant or at least mention it in a comment? I assumed you was guessing from the photo. Which confused me as I had just watched the news prior to seeing this. 
Nonetheless if they are using Firechat that is awesome. I really hope the Chinese authorities don't go steaming into these people in the next few days.

They make you pay to become a member of a non-profit organization? Is this normal?

hahaha brilliant

Doubt it's a crypto stock. Too early for that. Be that job posting they put out about coming to work for them on a Bitcoin project.

I'm sure they could invest in computing power to do this.

We need liquid exchanges before we'll see any significant increase in Bitcoin adoption. For bitcoin to be used as remittance and for it to be an improvement upon current Fiat alternatives it's crucial. And these need to be located in the countries whose Fiat currency is useful, USD, GBP, EUR, JPY just to start with. We can then start having services on top of Bitcoin that simplify dealing with it.  This is why getting any Bitcoin investment product to traditional investors is crucial. The ETF's, GABI, we need much, much, more.

Yes but Bitcoin put's you in control of your money instead of a centralized body. Also you can pay anyone anywhere with no fees. Ever paid for something in a foreign currency with paypal, their currency spread is very costly.
Your right about Bitcoin being more complicated, but that's a good thing and you don't need to understand it on a technical level just accept it can do certain things. So not only is it a digital currency, its a payment network and also a protocol on which other applications can be built upon.    
For me though Bitcoin is about challenging the status quo for a fairer system. The financial system is on its backside. Something like Bitcoin allows us to operate outside of these corrupt systems and force change for the greater good.
@_date: 2014-09-24 21:09:20
There's also a premium Vs the rest of the market. So if you want to buy Bitcoin to make a purchase it's going to cost you more.
@_date: 2014-09-04 22:38:42
Yes, I completely misread the whole thing haha. cheers.

Yes "some months ago" when the market price was around 950, so that is fair enough. The market price around the auction has been between 530-680 so paying 950 now offers absolutley no value what so ever to an investor.

If i wanted 30,00 coins I would either contact large mining pools or contact early adopters looking to cash out. Both are off market.
@_date: 2014-08-24 00:18:58
Yh im at the mercey of my banks GBP to USD exchange rate but its nice to know I have an instant buy option. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 16:16:51
No I'm from the UK and I got my invite about a month ago but on second thoughts it's not that big of a deal. 
I could link my debit card but not bank account. After contacting customer support I got this, 
"Circle supports US credit and debit cards, however some international cards will work. Additionally, only bank accounts from the US (that have a US feature called a routing number) will work when linking to your account.
The full extent of our international service have not yet been announced but we look forward to offering more for our non-US customers." 
I can buy and sell with circle but I'm at the mercy of my banks exchange rate and additional fees.

Is it not possible to have two copies of the paper wallet. Then you could have transferred the coins during the 9 hours and safely know that the other wallet copy in the safe will be useless.
@_date: 2014-07-01 23:48:33
$950 a coin. Not a bloody chance. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:18:32
Yes I agree to a certain degree but it would be no more than a 5% premium if at all. Its worth noting the miners need the buyers as much as buyers need the miners. If there is no buyers then their whole mining business will collapse unless they have the capital to cover the costs of the operation. 
The US Marshall is different because they were not negotiating any terms, they were accepting the highest bidder. So the only ones competing to get the best price are the buyers. All the buyers share the same sentiment that they want the best possible price which would be as low as possible. 
@_date: 2014-09-11 23:13:39
What multiple large data centers? I doubt  they would care much for it being 100% decentralized.
Edit: They liked the blockchain tech, if their blockchain was more or less centralised as in it's just them running the blockchain that's perfect for them. 
@_date: 2014-06-30 13:38:26
ye i meant to reply to the person above you. the 500GBP is shit but a step in the right direction at least. 
@_date: 2014-09-25 00:47:47
Yes so if they made a purchase from overstock using Bitcoin they bought from you it would cost 6% more right? 
I'm British so I may be missing something here.  Do you have to pay sales tax on the Bitcoins you sell?
@_date: 2014-08-19 17:50:45
With circle your account balance fluctuates with Bitcoin.

yh so i as right in what i said, thanks.
@_date: 2014-08-21 13:02:47
The ETF I think is the strongest contender for a catalyst. And Circle launching is big because it allows people outside of the US to buy bitcoin with a debit card or bank transfer, like Coinbase does for Americans. 
I also think that increasing ways to speculate on Bitcoin will appeal to traditional traders to come and trade more with digital currency I'm talking about the futures contracts, etc.
@_date: 2014-08-23 21:48:27
Where you from? I'm in with with my Debit Card. I'm from the UK.

Looks like if digital currency is ever going to be mainstream it would be one that is designed by the bank themselves. 


towards a fixed eventual supply. In addition to making it
extremely unlikely that a digital currency, as currently
designed, will achieve widespread usage in the long run, a
fixed money supply may also harm the macroeconomy:
it could contribute to deflation in the prices of goods and
services, and in wages"
Could they potentially design one where they can set the supply rate as they please? probably. 
Still would be good for Bitcoin.
Edit: Unless of course we see a major financial collapse before they have time to implement their own.

Yes nearly all of the UK sportbooks and betting exchanges accept Neteller. People use them because banks have been know to discriminate against people who have lots of deposits into betting accounts and have been known to deny people mortgages. Using something like Neteller masks the transactions from your bank account. Good news all round.
@_date: 2015-03-26 20:55:00
You can only sell if you've held the shares for 12 months.
