Is Coinbase's 'export to paper wallet' legit? Or would one send coins offline first THEN move to paper wallet to be safe?

then we all take to Reddit and express the extent of our outrage in full detail! So essentially... nothing

I used to work at Wells Fargo. Can confirm, retail banking salesmen will promise you ANYTHING to get a sale. Sorry this happened to your business.

WHAT CREDIT UNION HAS THAT MUCH INTEREST ON CHECKING?!?
@_date: 2013-12-16 10:43:59
Schwab for checking and American Express savings accounts are where it's at!
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:07:09
I commented on another post praising Schwab and got downvoted :( Coupled with an American Express savings account for maximum interest, I think it's a perfect set up. I do not work for either institution.

BUY BUY BUY!
Edit: Actually, you SELL SELL SELL so I can buy more.

same here. i considered the money 'spent' as soon as i invested. will consider investing more expendable income if the price drops low enough

It sucks, workers on the branch level, managers included, have almost no power anymore to override the computer's decision regarding credit/creditworthiness. I used to see this all the time; one recent hiccup in a lifetime of responsible banking/credit use, and there was nothing I could do to help the customer. Sorry for your situation.
