A single M normally denotes a thousand (except for the SI system where it means Mega, i.e a million) SO 30 M is 30000 BTC. A milli would be written as 30m. I am sure this number is a joke only

I used Brainwallet 3 years ago, downloaded the script and used it on a PC that never again will be on the internet. Also I used a printer that forever will be disconnected to any internet PC. The bitcoin I transferred to the paper wallet address seems to have been safe for 3 years, nobody has yet been able to take them. Maybe I have been lucky, malicious code can be inserted inside the script, making the private key simple to guess. Based on search, discussions threads etc I finally took the chance that it was ok to use. I do not know the status of such paper wallet generators today, you have to be quite careful. When transfering bitcoin out of a paper wallet, I recommend to swipe the key in Electrum and take it from there..

The fee is a price signal and should not be manipulated as it will cause distortion. Thus a fee can be too high for users who want to use bitcoin, but also it could be too low if the miners do not get paid sufficiently for their mining. As far as I understand, Segwit is making mining less profitable.
