1. Buy $15 worth of bitcoin.* 
2. "Spend" $15 worth of bitcoin through bitpay
3. Bitpay converts bitcoin to $15 in fiat and gives that to company.
4. You convert $16.50 into bitcoin.
Question - why not just use fiat for purchases without transferring it into bitcoin and buy some more bitcoin every little while?
Wouldn't you be saving transaction cost?
Bitcoin has a use, but purchasing things through bitpay seems silly to me...
*Transaction fees ignored for now

Unless it's in their mandate to invest in risky tech securities, the vast majority of investment managers are not going to buy bitcoin due to career risk.
If bitcoin goes down and you held bitcoin you look really stupid.  If bitcoin goes up and you don't hold it no one cares.  
There is very little incentive for a fund manager of any type to buy bitcoin.  If you want to juice your returns, you'll do it in other ways than "investing" in bitcoin.

Honest question - 
Isn't the beauty of bitcoin that it cuts out the middle man, thus eliminating that fee?  
If you are using Bylls, these are going to want a fee right?  Like all middlemen they aren't doing this shit for fun, they need to be compensated for their service.
Isn't bitcoin with middlemen the same as fiat with middlemen?  When I see comments that 90% of people would use bitcoin banks, wouldn't those banks have fees?  Isn't that how they would pay for the lights to be kept on and employees to get paid?  Don't these services kill the purpose of bitcoin?  Don't they introduce middlemen and add fees?
I haven't done all the research. I'm asking.

Not necessarily.  
While bitcoin is deflationary by nature, you could always have more sellers than buyers on the market.  
Prices could decline due to a panic and feedback loop that we deal with in financial markets with automatic stabilizers (halts) and a central bank.  Stocks also have fundamentals so we have an estimate on the worth (book value) of a business.  Bitcoin has no fundamentals so theoretically if a panic occurs there is no price where one can say "bitcoin is trading below it's intrinsic value".  
Bitcoin trades on emotion, not fundamentals.

Last trade on December 31 2013 - 1848.36.
We're still positive for the year.  
But that's not even the point.  We've moved from 666 on the S&amp;P to about 2000 with one real correction in 2011.  After the market decided to ignore Europes problems we've been on a historic ride.  Having a "correction" isn't crazy, nor is it a panic.  It's a serious move, but the first one in a while.  It was needed.

Cds is a credit default swap. It's a derivative. They sre derived from the prices of certain securities. 
They might have blown up the market, but don't be fooled into thinking they had no value as they were not "backed". They were. They didn't trade on emotion, they had some fundamentals as the companies they were derived from have earnings. 
Bitcoin doesn't have that. A bitcoin company does. If you invest in a bitcoin company you can find its intrinsic value. Bitcoin is just the protocol. You're buying the currency, not a company.

This is the only story I could find about someone having money taken out of their checking account due to credit card fraud.
It's fundamentally different than this UPS issue.  To take money from a checking account you would need to duplicate the card and have access to the pin number.  You need more than just the 16 digits on the front of the card.  
But this is all irrelevant.  Even if the thief manages to steal out of your account, it will be flagged due to unusual activity and you will be reimbursed for all missing money.  
I maintain there is no direct access to your checking account by taking the numbers VISA stores on file.
Remember please there is a huge difference between identity theft and credit card theft.  Identity theft can fuck up your life.  Credit card theft is a minor inconvenience.

Butt you aren't "investing" in a bitcoin company.  You are "investing" in the, well, I'm not so sure.  "Bitcoin".  A thing with no earnings that will "trade" based on human emotion and some fundamentals.  
The stock market can overshoot it's intrinsic value due to it being a public market, but the thought is it will eventually correct because again it's possible to actually calculate what the companies on the market are worth.  What is bitcoin worth?

The market didn't crash in 2008 because oil went down.
Canadian markets are getting smoked because of oil and gold being down.  I'm Canadian FYI.  
Greece has been a shithole for years.
But don't confuse all this with the stock market.  The stock market went down in 2008 because of CDS's (default insurance) were sold on CDO's (mortgage bonds) and when mortgages started going bust the CDS's were triggered and the financially important institutions couldn't pay.  This led to a bleed into the real economy.
But this time isn't the same at all!  Banks are doing alright.  They have more good assets and we aren't leveraging nearly as much as we were in the past.  I'd love to separate commercial and investment banking, but at the moment the banking industry isn't going to kill the economy/market.
The market is down right now because it's been up a lot and the fed stopped easing as much.  It's as simple as that.  Every other reason is just a narrative.  
We won't have a magical ending, but we will get through this.  The world always looks like it's ending.  We'll have bad times, but we'll keep going.  This market run isn't over yet.

No, not true at all.  
Yes, markets have bids and asks but those can be determined by fundamentals.  So simplified- yes markets trade on supply and demand, but not purely on supply and demand because they things they trade have quantifiable value.  
Oil has fundamentals - usage vs supply.  
Apple has fundamentals - cash flow.
These things can trade out of their fundamental range for a long time because of supply and demand of financial markets, but over the long run they will revert to the actual fundamentals. 
Bitcoin has none, so it's purely supply and demand.
I can argue oils fundamental value without talking about market supply and demand (bids/asks).

Just basic risk management professional investors do.  Because money is so portable these days there is no reason to keep your money at an institution that has potential solvency issues.

Yep, fuck usage rates and earnings multiples and cash flow.  These things don't matter at all.  Value is subjective and therefore indeterminable.  My bad.  


Oops.  I thought I chose a decent example of something that was *trading* away from fundamentals and then reverted back to them.  I thought about [Rex Tillerson, CEO of Exxon, saying oil prices should be at about $60 a barrel]( if we were looking at fundamentals.  


Oh goodness.  My mistake!  Thanks for the economics lesson here.  When I said cash flows and fundamentals I clearly meant the extremely accurate future of the companies.  I forgot in business/finance/everything we guess and estimate future value based on historical methods - including a cash flow analysis.   Although I recognized these methods are not perfect and relied on real numbers that actually occurred, I should have realized the future is a bitch and not even worth trying to figure out. 
My bad.  I'll just fold to your undeniable logic and convert all my financial assets to bitcoin now.  Because of the fundamentals.

I'm not saying bitcoin has no value - I'm saying it doesn't have an *intrinsic* value.  I'm saying at this point the price makes as much sense at $50 as it does at $250.
I agree with your tech stock analogy to a degree.  With tech stocks you would be investing in a business with money making potential.  With bitcoin you are investing in a protocol.  If you want to compare buying tech stocks with starting/investing in a bitcoin **BUSINESS** I'd fully agree.
I'll disagree with " no one cared much about the price of oil, and as the industrial age began only speculators dreamed of how valuable it would eventually become. There were no "fundamentals" to guide them.".  I read a 1,200 page book by Daniel Yergin that would indicate otherwise.  
This chart would seriously disagree with your oil opinion.  As production declined prices increased.  When supply was found and drilled, prices declined.  
I just need to be clear that I'm not saying bitcoin is worthless, I'm saying that those saying it's cheap at $250 have absolutely no basis for saying that.  
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:41:27


I'm not trolling, I'm honestly asking - what's the true value of a bitcoin?
With no cash flow, the price is purely determined by supply and demand.
Clearly the demand isn't there.  So what's the true price?  Why is the price low now?  Why not $50?  Why can't this message read in a year "At prices below $50 I'd probably look to start buying 1 BTC a month".  
And no, don't think this is a recent bearish view - I've been saying this on this sub since the price was $800. 
I just don't understand what makes these "cheap" besides them trading at higher levels in the past.  
Edit - so I stop getting really stupid replies - clearly the demand isn't there *to sustain a rising bitcoin price*.  I know how markets work.  I get that every seller has a buyer.  There is no excess demand.  There is no demand to increase the price.  Right now, there is very little demand for bitcoin.  Doesn't mean it doesn't have value.  Doesn't mean there isn't a bid.

NASDAQ: SUPER MARIO NOW AWARE!
This is essentially a Nasdaq blog.  They aren't making a commentary here.  They linked a 'wochit' video.
Every time Martin Tillier is linked as "Nasdaq" I cringe.
It's a damn blog.  It being on the Nasdaq blog doesn't give it added credibility.

My financial risk using email - none. 
But ya, they're completely the same.

So Zoom, a regulated/audited public company based out of San Francisco, had its corporate bank account robbed.  
In its 10-Q filed on November 3rd on the SEC website they list cash and equivalents of almost $94 million.
It's also a company trading on an exchange - fundamentally different than an exchange having funds stolen. 
I'd also like to point out we've had people lose their jobs over this.  
But ya, whatever.  This is good new for bitcoin somehow!

Fine. I'll simplify valuing a company for the sake of this discussion - book value per share.  
A company has value because it sells something and makes a profit.
A commodity has value because people use it to make stuff or they eat it.
Gold is a special commodity that has value because it has a long history of not eroding.  
Bitcoin does not have a history to make it a good hedge against the USD.  There is no correlation between the BTC price and fiat currencies.
But to keep this really easy - the book value of a money making company.

I think this is my favorite bitcoin thing - the vast history of it! That you extrapolate trends from way back in 2011.
3 years of activity means nothing. Just because it happened 2 years ago doesn't mean it's going to happen today. 
It's ridiculous.

No, thank you.

Oh!  My bad then.  Guess that settles it.

Ya, what are the posters at going to do now that a website no one goes to is down?

I didn't have the heart to fight about this yesterday, but this is the exact reply I'd get when I'd say Silk Road isn't infallible.  
People would tell me I don't get TOR, or I just don't get it.
Fine.  I'm no CS major.  I do know the world though and governments/people have a way of adapting.
I'll simply say, it won't be that easy.  Governments will adapt.

This is awesome. 
I can't comprehend your thought process. "they'll be so confused with our decentralized everything they'll just give up completely!" 
This shit is just so fucking stupid. You don't think governments would adapt? Make new laws? New systems? You think they just won't collect tax? 
Jesus titty fucking christ. This place can be fucking ridiculous.
