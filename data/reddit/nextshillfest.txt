Ok let me explain further. I copy and pasted my send address not recieve. So i send the coin to the send address in electrrum. It is removed from my Dream account but obviously not showing up in my wallet cause it wasn't the recieve address. Any ideas?

Easy way for them to steal unproven funds.

Wasn't talking about the judge. I was talking about your friendly neighborhood government that will put you in jail for not paying your crypto tax then when you bail out with cryto they just steal the rest.

Not sure what you mean. I sent the money to the send address not the recieve and it never showed up or bounced back yet?
