And we know this, because a self professed economist said it. Take that you so- called experts and journalists!!!1!

So in your opinion comparing say losing inherently risky investments, turning out a loss after receiving government subsidies and losing _stored_ money are so similar issues that differentiating them isn't worth the effort?

They aren't reasonably similar, not from a regulatory nor from a consequence point of view, that is my point. It would be like me stating that dying from falling from a tree an dying from a poisonous plant are relatively similar, because they both involve plants and dying.

I would like _you_ to actually document _your_ claims. I'm weird like that.

No, that is a way too broad definition and makes any attempt of arguing about the topic moot. I highly suspect that your degree is fictitious if this usually how you go about arguing.

Not sure what you think that proves..? 
Your original comment is still weak. 
But if you think you are making me look like a tool, and that saves your day, well, have at it..:)
