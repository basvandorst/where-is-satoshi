I am working on a fully secure peer to peer buy/sell platform that is expected to be out in a month. It will be so easy to buy crypto from anyone and not just exchanges. There will be no limit and you will be able ro get your crypto same day. Any specific features you would like to suggest?

I don't know as of today but in about a month you will have the option to buy from peers securely with cash or direct bank transfer/interac e-transfer. You can guess who is developing that platform.

They would want the fiat to go down compared to bitcoin. Only then their bitcoin will be worth more.
