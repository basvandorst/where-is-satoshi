Update: On Multibit it says the transaction has gone through. On coinbase it doesnt show the transaction at all. On multibit it says the transaction is not standard and should not be trusted... Im wondering if its the wrong address. I copied and pasted it but coinbase changed the receiving address shortly after

No, it says on Multibit that the transaction went through but on coinbase it doesnt show the transaction.

Read the wiki, and the bitcointalk.org forum. I just started mining bitcoins with the 2 bitforce jalapenos I just got and so far it's made me about $4 bitcoins in a day :-|

I saw a lot of posts like this on metal investing sites after their bubble popped and deflated. It's sort of hopium, when in reality, their investment lost value. A lot of, "the price went down, great I can buy more!", "so what if the fiat conversion rate went down? sittin' looking at all that shiny there, I still have the same number of ounces, and more on the way!"

Because I didn't realize the original bitcoin wallet from bitcoin.org would be a complete waste of time, disc space and bandwidth.

Don't presume to know what I think about the Fed just because I don't take Keiser too seriously. He's joking, half joking or blowing things out of proportion a lot of the time in the beginning of the show anyways.

Max is pretty much Captain Hyperbole in my book, so take whatever he says with a grain of salt and a shot of tequila and chill the fuck out.

Glad I had 40 free gb on that drive. Ye olde blockchain should make for good reading I suppose /s. Now I wish I'd gotten the online wallet to begin with.

I wasn't comparing the markets as much as the mentality of the investors.

I'm at 12 gh/s so 12000 mhash. If I leave my setup on 24/7 it should theoretically make around $6/day at this difficulty. anything less than a few gh/s is pointless, IMO. Even what I have now is small potatoes, and will make little or nothing in a few months. Considering switching to mining altcoins with it that might have more upside.

Newb here. Dowloaded bitcoin wallet and almost one week later, it's still "synchronizing to network" and still 39 weeks behind. How is that not a huge turnoff to new people? I'm perplexed... this is cutting edge? How is all the hype worth this? How long is it going to take years from now with many millions of transactions later? Yea, I know I can have an online wallet, but is that more safe, how do I know?
