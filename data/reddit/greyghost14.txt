"going into economic crisis" and "could see the ORGANIC adoption". Does anyone else find this very contradicting in explanation? Seriously, how can something be 'organic' when in this situation a 'crisis' theoretically was imposed and could have avoided.

Ive read a lot on it but just not the ins' and outs' of setting it up. honestly, i would love to meet people in person and get good info. im totally anti fed reserve etc. they have done nothing but inflate our currency. if we were still on the gold standard, at least we would have a balance, check point on our system to a degree. I think i will get in it soon, just need to take secure precautions etc. be more "anonymous" online.
