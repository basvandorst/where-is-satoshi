I think standard wisdom is to put large amounts of Bitcoin in a cold storage wallet, which is a private key you generate offline and keep off network connected machines until you're ready to spend. You load it with the public key associated with that address. Whether you store it on paper or digital storage or both is up to you, and its important that you keep it secret and never lose it, two goals that often conflict.
As far as web wallets go, the one people seem to like the most is blockchain.info, since it's encrypted in a way that it's decrypted locally, so anyone who gets access to blockchain.info's data would have no ability to use it without your password, assuming there's no flaw in the  implementation. This is similar to how lastpass and spideroak treat your data.
My personal thought is that you could probably do pretty well with a hot wallet on a smartphone and your typical computer for spending cash, and huge, life changing amounts of Bitcoin in cold storage wallets. The blockchain.info wallets are somewhere in between.
To be clear, most people trust coinbase's intentions, but the concern is that they could accidentally leak private keys or otherwise have a dangerous security leak for your savings/investment.

That's like saying USD gains value by the price of linen, ink and printing presses, when it's more complicated than that.
If bitcoin is truly "backed" by anything, I'd say it's backed by clever cryptography that makes it pretty much impossible to double spend a finite supply of coins that only exist as data.
But it really gains value from speculation and people's trust/hope that it will achieve some level of adoption as a currency, balanced by the fact that the cryptography keeps the market from getting flooded with new coins or false transactions that kill trust in the currency's value.
@_date: 2013-12-08 13:29:45
I agree, that's a major flaw.  Bitcoin needs an easy way to get fiat in and fiat out for everybody for it to be the next Western Union.  I think requiring users to use a separate exchange would put the difficulty curve too high.
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:02:53
I'd not say better, but it has  momentum and more adoption and most other coins don't offer much compelling reasons for adoption, as far as I've seen. The upshot is that Bitcoin isn't deeply flawed in any way other cryptocoins aren't.
Primecoin is a neat concept, though. I don't see it being a new Bitcoin, but maybe in the future big distributed computing could pay dividends in stocks for proof of work.  An underfunded scientist could design a simulation, wrap it in a cryptocoin  protocol, and people interested in the research could support it via mining or buying the coins from mining, and effectively offer more incentive than just  philanthropy to get the research done. I'm not an economist, so I have no idea how well that would work in practice, but it makes me feel warm and fuzzy to imagine that future.

That paper probably contains what's called a private key, which is the code a bitcoin client needs to spend money from an address.
With that private key, you can load it into a piece of software called a Bitcoin Client.  If it has a QR code, you should be able to load it up on your Android phone (assuming you have one) with an app like Blockchain or Mycelium.  Mycelium is a client that can hold your Bitcoins in a wallet stored locally, and Blockchain is one of the more secure web-stored wallets, in that your wallet will be encrypted in a way that nobody at Blockchain could access it unless they had your password.  I personally use Blockchain, although I tried Mycelium and liked it.
Once you have that private key loaded into a Bitcoin client, have that client create a separate private key and send the bitcoin to that, so that if anyone ever got a copy of the first private key, they cannot take your bitcoin.
It'd probably be fine to store the Bitcoin on that private key on the paper, as I trust anyone running an ATM wouldn't want to go through all the trouble of setting one up to steal from people.  But if the private key is somehow in the machine's memory, and that's compromised, that address on the paper could be drained.  Therefore, I'd move it off.
This is assuming it's a small-ish amount of bitcoin you're eager to spend quickly.  For larger amounts, the solution is instead "cold storage," which you can find explained many times in this reddit.  For cold storage, you generate a wallet from an offline computer, and never bring that wallet online unless you are ready to spend, and send your funds to that wallet.  It's generally advised to do this from a Linux live distribution.
I'm sorry if this is a lot at once, but Bitcoin's strength and weakness is that there's no central authority, and no chargebacks, so keeping your Bitcoins secure is your responsibility, as once they are gone, there's not much you can do to get them back.  Feel free to ask me about anything I didn't explain too well.
EDIT: Let's make a tl;dr that should be "good enough":
1. Create an account on Blockchain.info's wallet page.  I suggest you use a strong password you won't lose/forget and use two-factor authentication.
2. Load your private key into that account, either by typing in the code on the website or using the QR reader on the phone app.  The app has an option to scan a private key.  The website has a textbox to enter the private key under the "import-export" tab.
3. Click the "Receive Money" tab and click "New Address."  This will be where you move your funds.  Name it if you like.
4. Copy the new address (the long string of characters) into your clipboard, and go to the send money tab.  Paste it in the "to" box, and enter the amount of bitcoin you want to send.  There might be a small transaction fee, so you might want to try sending a slightly smaller amount of bitcoin than you need to if it rejects it the first time.
5. Go back to "Receive Money."  Click the actions button next to the address from the paper, and choose to archive it, so that you don't accidentally use that address.

@_date: 2013-11-25 23:32:38
I've noticed people tend to recommend using a typically offline computer for "cold storage" of larger amounts of BTC.  Why is it that you need a full computer offline (less chance of being hacked than a full time computer, or something else?), as opposed to say, a USB key with the private key that you never plug in except to spend?  And would a USB key with live linux and the private key and a BTC client be the best option with minimal hardware?
I'm missing the reason for a full computer you only plug in for spending big BTC amounts, vs. software or a full OS for the same purpose, barring less likely stuff like BIOS level hacking or your computer getting physically altered to somehow leak information, like with a keylogger.
That said, Raspberry Pi is pretty much perfect for that, since it's small (easy to store/hide/lock away), network connectable, and cheap.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:12:28
Until there's a bitcoin ATM (or at least a reliable cash exchanger of some sort) in every major city, I have to agree for now.  The current system to get fiat in and out of bitcoin is just too cumbersome for most people.

@_date: 2013-11-22 18:59:51
I think they're saying the price is unimportant for bitcoin to function as a currency.  Bitcoin could be worth $1 trillion each, but because it's very highly divisible, that wouldn't impact its ability to be used to buy goods and services.  However, the amount of reliable businesses that accept bitcoin do make the difference between it being just a speculative item and a currency.
I think another factor is volatility on whether people spend bitcoin, as most people aren't happy storing their spending money in a form that can vary large percentages by the hour.  Of course, that will change as more people adopt the currency.
I think the upshot is that bitcoin is working as a commodity of sorts, but the currency part is not that related to the price.  But price does drive up adoption, which is a big first step.

If you want to buy things in bitcoin, but don't want to lose your amount of bitcoin, you could always buy an equal amount of bitcoin to the amount you spent from an exchange.
This, of course, requires that you have a stash of bitcoin ready to deal with the lag that comes in waiting for a bitcoin order to go through (I know this varies between exchanges, but I use coinbase without a credit card, so it takes a while).  And it reduces bitcoin to an intermediate currency.  But it's probably a good step between bitcoin being used mostly as a commodity (like gold) and instead being used more as a payment network (like debit cards).

I agree.  I feel like Bitcoin, today, is overvalued.  There's not enough sites using it for what it's meant to be, a way of moving money, and too many people using it as a speculative commodity.
However, everyone is free to use Bitcoin as they like.
But if we as a community want bitcoin to keep growing and last, we're going to need to figure out ways to make it catch on.  We're going to need to keep offering it at our businesses, and find ways it can work around the snags in fiat and banking products.  Bitcoin today does not have a killer app for most people, in my opinion, but it definitely has laid the groundwork for someone to make one.  It's not enough to say it was worthless a few years ago, and exponentially more valuable now.  That's irrational exuberance talking, and it doesn't do anything to encourage people to use bitcoin beyond holding on to it hoping they can get rich, too.
Let's try to keep making Bitcoin better at a rate faster than the Paypals and Wells Fargos of the world can improve.

Basically, imagine Bitcoin (the protocol) is a ledger with tons of addresses. (An address is like a row in a table in Excel or a database)
Each address has a private key, a balance, and a public key.  If you know the private key, you can derive the public key and spend the money, and if you just have a public key, you can check the balance at the address and give it money.  There are a boggling number of private addresses, and it's statistically impossible to pick the same one as someone else at random using a good random number generator, like what Multibit or any other good client uses.
A wallet is a collection of private keys.  If you go into multibit and ask it to generate a new address to receive bitcoins at, it adds a new private key to your wallet, and gives you the public key to give to the person sending the coins.  And if you spend money, multibit generates a transaction based off the private key you have stored.
This also means if you have a backup of your wallet, you can regenerate your balances even if your balances have changed, because a wallet is just the addresses in the ledger.
tl;dr: Wallets are collections of private keys, and private keys are the "passwords" used to authorize bitcoin transactions from your wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:30:29
I think in the future, cold storage will be seen the same way burying cash in a tin can looks today.
Today, managed wallets are risky, but they won't always be. Once Bitcoin managed wallets can get some form of insurance or at least a track record of reliability, I think the community will have a change of heart towards letting others guard their money. Maybe there's an economic or ideological argument against this, but people expect and demand that kind of oversight of their money.
I say either way, it's very irresponsible to not come up with a way to relay your savings to your dependents, no matter how young you are.
Edit: also, it's hubris to assume Bitcoin will be mankind's final currency. There are tons of currencies reduced to being collectable coins, and who's to say someone won't develop something better than Bitcoin that's incompatible with the existing blockchain?
I recall reading that scripting could be implemented into the btc protocol, so in theory future developments of Bitcoin could actually credit people coins if certain conditions were met.  Perhaps it could require a digitally signed death certificate from a clerk or lawyer. Granted, that's a big undertaking and could be very exploitable if done wrong.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:26:30
Your wallet is more secure, in that if someone found the file, they'd need your password to get your private key.  It's not the most secure, though.  Say someone hacked your PC, got your wallet, and also installed a keylogger.  They could decode your wallet if they got you typing a key.
This is why people are very big on cold storage for big amounts of bitcoin, as keeping your wallet off of network-connected computers means nobody can drain it, but you can load it via transactions to its public key.
It's probably fine for spending cash, and maybe even moderate amounts of money.
Also, Multibit, as written in the binaries, currently has an unchangeable amount of fees to ensure prompt transactions, but which I've found makes most of my transactions have a .0001 fee, which is about $.10 and probably higher than most of my transactions need.  The developer confirms this is unchangeable because he's worried too many new users would have trouble picking appropriate fees, so keep that in mind if you plan on using this wallet for lots of small transaction.
@_date: 2013-12-05 23:55:10
The issue with buying Bitcoins is that you need to get them with a payment that's harder to reverse, as many people issue charge-backs on Bitcoins that lead to the Bitcoin vendor/exchange getting screwed.
I recommend you use a checking account with Coinbase.  People moan whenever they have small issues, but in general, they work well and are pretty trustworthy.  Buy the bitcoin with them, and move it to your Blockchain account.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:33:51
It's also not always clear what changes in the altcoins are actually good in practice.  For example, some people on here argue the way Litecoin gets faster transaction confirmations is less secure than Bitcoin's method of confirming transactions.
As with most engineering, there's not one perfect design, but a lot of good designs that might be better suited to one situation over another.

The problem is that Bitcoin needs to make updates that ensure the blockchain doesn't fork, and unless they can get everyone mining bitcoin to adopt the new version of the protocol at once, that's a risk with big changes that aren't coded in a way to be back-compatible.
It's possible, but not that practical.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:43:54
I agree that Bitcoin, or any other financial product for spending money online, should be easy to use safely if it is to be adopted.  However, considering there's no recourse for stolen bitcoins via a central authority or legal action, rolling your own security via stuff like cold storage is pretty important for big amounts.
I mean, to be fair, I wouldn't store a huge amount of money in a common bank account, either.  But I wouldn't be nearly as terrified keeping $26,000 in a bank account as I would be putting it in an online bitcoin wallet or a computer that regularly accesses the internet.  In addition, depending on your income, having $26,000 in an easy to access account isn't that crazy.

I'm not so sure.  The saying goes, "Even a dead cat bounces," and Bitcoins do offer a valuable service in that they offer money transfers, so they'd offer a bit more than a "dead cat."
Of course, the real question is what would trigger such a dive.  I'd think it'd be something like the Bitcoin protocol found to have a major exploit that couldn't be reasonably fixed, or major ISPs/banks/governments finding a way to cripple the Bitcoin network.  Both seem far-fetched, but they're not impossible.
If bitcoin was fundamentally broken or crippled, with no hope of repair, I think most people here who still had faith in the idea of cryptocurrency would move on to something less vulnerable to whatever flaw came up.

Your computer has your private key stored in an encrypted way in your wallet file.  When you use your password, it decrypts the encrypted key to use it.
If you want to export your private key (say to use it with another client), you can click "Tools &gt; Export Private Keys" in Multibit.
Remember, if anyone gets your private key, they can spend your money, so I'd recommend keeping it in a password protected file at least.
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:22:51
Bitcoin is based on keys that request the amount of BTC you own from the blockchain.  The blockchain isn't really a collection of data representing coins, but instead the history of all the transactions Bitcoin has gone through and a ledger of what the addresses own.  It's true it's a pretty big file now.
You don't need a local copy of the blockchain to get your number of bitcoins.  You just need your client to go online and ask the network about the wallet associated with your key.
The file you have is just a key.  The closest analogy I can think of is that your ATM card doesn't change as you gain or spend money.

Quite good.  Some versions can actually have 30% of the code missing and still scan, which is why you have QR codes with icons superimposed in the middle and stuff.

Is it a public speaking class?
I'd try not to get bogged down in economics, as people have strong opinions on politics and economics and they might shut down if you say too much they disagree with, and besides, a government can already control the rate at which money is created or link it to a standard.  Bitcoin simply has its own creation policy.
What I'd instead focus on is what Bitcoin does that is new.  Explain to them the difference between cash and a typical data file, and offer an ELI5-style explanation of what cryptography can do and how it can make data create a synthetic commodity.  Maybe make the presentation a bit broader and explain how cryptography is already used by everyone, but they don't realize it.  For example, that is why you can type your credit card number into a website and that data can jump across so many routers and companies without a single unethical employee swiping it between you and the company you are doing business with.
There's a good paint-mixing analogy for public key cryptography in the book 9 Algorithms that Changed the Future, which explains the upshot of the idea really clearly without getting bogged down in math.

Yes, you can access it from other computers.  I would recommend that you set it up with 2 factor authentication (where you get a code via a text message or an app on your phone to enter along with a password when you login).  That makes it much harder to break into your account.
The tricky thing with bitcoin wallets is that you need to never lose them, but you also need to never reveal them, either, and those goals are often counterproductive.  If you were to store it offline and never make a copy, it's unlikely to be stolen, but also easy to lose.  And if you make lots of copies, you're more likely to leak one.  Blockchain.info is a happy medium, in that it's a secure wallet.
Keep in mind if you lose your login, their ability to help you back into your account is limited, so make sure you remember your password and store that mnemonic they give you when creating a new account.
And cold storage is the safest method for storing large amounts of bitcoin, but it's also less easy and not as easy to spend from.

I meant, debit card issuers.
@_date: 2013-11-26 22:15:09
My understanding is that blockchain.info is implemented in a way that your wallet is encrypted with no keys any Blockchain.info employee (or hacker who gets their files) would have.  To them, the database of private keys is gibberish until you locally decode yours on your client.  Whether the implementation is correctly done (no flaws) is impossible to tell, and I doubt they messed it up, but it's not the absolutely most secure option for the paranoid.
Not so for Coinbase.  I'd buy and sell through coinbase, and maybe even use it to pay someone whose email you know but whose public address isn't known, but if someone breaks into coinbase, there's a higher chance they could take your coins.  It's better to put those coins in a safer wallet.  Blockchain.info is probably good enough for medium amounts.
Cold storage is the best option for big amounts.

Here's where it gets even more interesting.  You can also have an offline wallet with the right client on an offline machine generate the orders drawing from your account, and then transfer those orders to an online machine (say via a QR code or printout or SD card) that relays that message.  So you could check your private key's balance online, and then generate a payment from an offline device, and relay that message describing the order to your online device.
Because of the encryption, no machine other than your offline machine has to know your private key.
This is something you can do with the client Armory, and IIRC, there is also a hardware device you can use that works similarly.  I get the feeling we'll be seeing more of this in the future, as it's pretty risky to store a large wallet on an online machine.  It's probably safe for spending cash, though.
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:04:58
I have to agree with this.  I love the idea and technology behind bitcoin, and if its transaction system could replace cash, it would be great as it gets rid of so many middleman services.  But so long as I am paid in cash, and most things I buy are charged in cash, it's more a risky investment until more services accept bitcoin.
Add on the fact that this method of tiny transfers to recoup a BTC fund would invoke exchange fees and money slowly moving over wires/ACH (at least in the US) and it's not very convenient, especially if merchants are charging the same with a debit card and BTC.
However, if most shops took bitcoin, it'd be an attractive alternative to the debit card system.  It'd cost consumers and merchants less, and it'd be more secure by design because of the public key system.  Any merchant or bugged terminal could capture my debit card information, but bitcoin takes care of that.  Bitcoin ATMs would also be useful, as they're a more straightforward way to convert cash to Bitcoin than Cash -&gt; Bank/Money Order Company -&gt; Exchange.
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:19:26
I'm not sure I'd be comfortable trusting a private key someone else made long term.  The ATM shouldn't be storing the private keys it generates, but there's no real guarantees and it takes such little effort to make a new private key for either cold storage or a safer hot wallet, I don't see any good reason not to move the bitcoin out.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:00:05
Bitcoins are very divisible.  The smallest unit you can work with today is .00000001, or one Satoshi.
So long as you are buying enough for it to be worthwhile (greater than exchange fees), it's possible.
For example, Coinbase charges 1% plus a $.15 flat fee for bank transfers.  Meaning, I could buy ~1/1000th of a bitcoin for around a dollar, if I was okay with paying ~$.15 in fees for it.

Really, protocols are the languages of the internet. People seem to see the internet as products, when a lot of its coolest features are developed from clever protocols. The internet itself became possible because of protocols enabling separate, formerly private and/or proprietary networks to communicate in a common way. 
What's really drawn me to Bitcoin is the cleverness of making a synthetic commodity with no central authority. Even if it tanks and doesn't get adopted in place of existing financial systems, we are still smarter for having this idea at our disposal. I'm really excited to see what can be made aside from currency with Bitcoin's contribution to cryptography.

Do bitcoins actually "exist" in that there is a piece of data someone could look at and say, "That's a bitcoin" rather than it being a wallet or part of the blockchain?  Or are they strictly just numbers on a ledger, and they solely exist as an abstraction that feels real because that ledger has proven near-impossible to change without following its rules?
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:30:53
Bitcoins don't really have data directly associated with them like a .doc file.  They're essentially numbers on a ledger, but the ledger is very secure and can practically only be modified with transactions.
Your wallet file contains a key that gives you access to this ledger at the address your number of bitcoins is in, and the privilege to make transfers to other addresses.
You cannot remove Bitcoins from the blockchain.  By definition, a Bitcoin is part of the blockchain.  Even if you were to lose your wallet's file, the coins associated with it would exist in the blockchain.  It's just that nobody would have any chance of guessing your key because it's such a large random number, so to humanity, the coins are lost.

I think his point is that you can't get exactly 1/3 of a bitcoin, but you'd be so close that nobody would really care.  It's pedantic.

There's no way Bitcoin can ever be zero again, in my opinion, unless the network shuts down, as mining implies that it's worth something to at least that miner.
Further, there's people adding value to Bitcoin beyond speculators. There are people who keep wealth in Bitcoin because they feel it's a failsafe that's not tied to government money policy. There's also people who are sure Bitcoin will be adopted someday as the de facto currency of thee industrialized world.  Similar to gold investors. Gold has had bubbles from speculation, but it's not worthless.
And that's just the people intent on holding Bitcoin. Add in people using Bitcoin for commerce and avoiding currency control, and it definitely has a non zero value, especially as those applications become more popular.

Come to think of it, an offline Raspberry Pi/Beaglebone or maybe even an Arduino with the right parts could make a pretty cool offline paper wallet generator.
Adafruit happens to sell a [receipt-style thermal printer]( so if you wrote code that could generate a BTC wallet private key with an appropriately random seed, and had it produce a QR code on the printer and maybe even save the code to an SD card, you'd be able to make cold wallets at the push of a button.  I'm guessing an Arduino would be plenty for everything, although you'd want a random number generator up to the task.
