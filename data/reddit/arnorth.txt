Are you familiar with [paper wallets]( They're also a great way to back up your bitcoins, probably the best way. When discussing security of funds with the skeptical, paper wallets are a good point to make. If you lose access to your bank account for whatever reason, you can't recreate it on the fly with a few keystrokes as you can with Bitcoin (assuming the wallet is kept safe) .
It's ironic that a currency/asset that can only exist in the network in this time and place is best preserved by the old methods of paper and ink.

My biggest issue with Marx is also my biggest issue with Capitalism: in both systems, the individual is relegated and collectivized into a mere economic unit. Both systems ultimately dehumanize the individual. In  the end, it's not even really about Marxism or Capitalism but is more about the power of the State being used by a minority to oppress the majority while hiding behind some ideology or another. Marxism and Capitalism are both collectivist ideologies so the power of the State is a perfect fit for either belief structure.

Proof of work is the security of the network. As all of the recorded transactions in the blockchain are the result of computing trillions of cryptographic hashes, those records are all linked in the blockchain such that someone would have to build a network with hashing power greater than that working on the current blockchain in order to control the network and the blockchain. It's known as the [51% attack](

Over time, bitcoin distribution will become more decentralized as it spreads out over the humans of Planet Earth. Prices set by the large exchanges will mean less as Bitcoin rises in value and thus exchanges will lose their ability to manipulate prices.

Coinbase is pulling an old trick: they're getting the use free money for a few days. People are essentially loaning them cash which they can use to buy a bunch of coins, disburse the coins to their really large customers and then return the free money to the small customers by throwing "high risk" baloney at them (when someone uses you and then claims it's for everyone's safety, sniff the air for that fragrant poop smell).
Coinbase is cleaning up on the rubes.

If the cryptography behind Bitcoin is broken, then all crypto is broken. Would people ever trust banks, governments, the internet or anything else that uses crypto?
I'd trust a quantum cryptocurrency that was as well-constructed as Bitcoin is. As there is no quantum cryptocurrency at the moment, Bitcoin will have to do.

This is an important point though: Bitcoin is a disruptive technology, just as the internet in general, and the web specifically, also were. It would serve you, and other critics of Bitcoin, to perform due diligence and learn something about the protocol before passing judgement on it.

Bitcoin won't ever be adopted in the regular economy. It has no place in a centrally controlled economy except to divert it to its own needs. 
Bitcoin only needs a .1% adoption rate to be a $15 billion dollar economy in its own right. 2-3 years is my guess. By then, central banks and the governments they fund should be weak enough that they won't be able to do much about it. 
They can't even do much about stopping people from sharing files via P2P. They certainly will be able to do less about people sharing money via encrypted P2P.

If you study bitcoin price charts, you notice an odd pattern: price spikes followed by the expected profit taking BUT the bottom of the trough is generally higher than the previous trough.

As you can only buy and sell from one dealer on Coinbase, and only in US dollars, it doesn't fit the idea of an exchange, imo. It's more like a Bitcoin store.
If it were an exchange, one would be able to buy and sell Bitcoins to anyone else on the exchange using other currencies.

It's a net positive to increase a protocol's programming libraries. Bitcoin is still a relatively new protocol and has no complete C libraries associated with the functions of the protocol.
There will be some environments where bitcoind would be too cumbersome. Embedded devices are one example. A cbitcoin library would open the possibility of Bitcoin being put on more embedded devices more easily.

Bitcoin uses several common crypto algorithms. Those same algorithms are used by everyone else - banks, governments, militaries, etc. Even if the algorithms are different, the math behind all crypto shares the same principles.
If quantum computing ever developed to the point that it could break Bitcoin's crypto, that would mean that all crypto is vulnerable. 
How does a centralized bank freezing everyone's assets differ from losing one's bitcoins?

Bitcoin was designed with changing crypto as part of the plan if needed. If crypto had to change, I suspect small, open source projects like Bitcoin could switch over more quickly than the large, centralized dinosaurs like Bank of America would be able to.

This puzzles me. Marx is the one that, for all intents and purposes, defined Capitalism. Voluntary trade, without the State involved, has been the default human activity for as long as human beings have been around.
Even free-market capitalism still utilizes the State for protection of property rights. We both know how poorly the State manages to contain itself once it's been tasked to "protect" something.

I've been involved in Bitcoin for two years now. I've made hundreds, if not thousands, of transactions in that time. I'm a pretty typical early adopter in many ways. I'd never waste my bitcoins on weed or gambling. That's what the dollar is for. ; )


It's getting so almost any transaction through "official" channels these days can be deemed as illicit by the powers that be for whatever reason. 
Personally, I don't care what people buy with their coins. Their money, their choice. I look forward to Bitcoin badly hurting, if not crushing, the fiat system and its impediments to open commerce.

I've seen other exchanges do it but not due to shortages. I was on an exchange last year when the price started dropping and the site "broke". I never did business with them again. 
I don't understand why people do biz with coin base anyway. There are other ways to get bitcoins that don't require a credit check.
