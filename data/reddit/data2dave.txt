The mods are removing this thread but then my next question would be what does capping do to the price of Bitcoin? It has to stabilize to some point to a be trustworthy unit of exchange.

China is number one in energy consumption and pollution.

I can see better tech in the 300 meter long asic ("server"?$) sheds but that'll take tons of time rebuilding such massive infrastructure ( new chip and transistor tech) but bitcoin is built upon "proof of work" which leads to ever more electric use -- more than exponentially. Proof of space is supposed to solve this but isn't Bitcoin built on an old irresponsible model? I am not electrician nor engineer but I respect the editors at Spectrum who also are loving blockchain in other applications. 
That's where the quote came from.

Ieee spectrum reports that a bitcoin transaction uses 5000 times more energy than a visa transaction.

Bitcoin usage could be proportional to sea level rise? Energy use going up is inefficient that's all .
