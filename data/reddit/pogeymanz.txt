Bitcoin is a long time away from being a true currency. I'm a "true believer" in that I believe cryptocurrency of some kind will, at very least, live along side of fiat money in the minds of the general public. I don't know when this will happen. Skeptics who argue that it's too volatile to be a currency are obviously completely ignorant to the idea that it's a nascent technology that only a tiny, tiny sliver of the population even holds- let alone uses. It's like those people don't understand the difference between today and tomorrow. What I tell people who ask me about bitcoin is: it has properties that make it have the potential to be a fantastic currency and it's already being accepted and traded as such by early adopters.
So, like I said, I think it will get there, but I have no idea how long it will take.
But, I'll know when we're there when there are no more centralized "symbols" of bitcoin. When an exchange doesn't get confused with bitcoin. When a foundation doesn't get confused as being the CEOs/controllers of bitcoin. Etc.
This is all noise. We don't need the whole general public to jump on board and start using bitcoin ASAP. Like you said, it will survive anything. If this thing is still around in 10 years, people are going to say "holy shit- that thing I thought was a scam 10-15 years ago is still around? I guess there must be *something* to it."
That's how we'll get people. Resilience. Don't be impatient Stop trying to get the price higher at all costs. You probably wont be millionaires- so get back to your day job. But that's *okay*. We're part of a technological movement that really could still change the world, even if assholes like Karpeles are slowing the movement down. Be patient.

Gox was not the biggest for a long time, actually. It was the first big exchange, though, so that counts for something I guess.
It also doesn't matter at all. Nobody should've been keeping coins on an exchange unless they planned to trade with them. That's like giving your stock broker all of your money to hold on to.

Hash rate is a measure of how powerful your miner is. The more mining power you have, the more transactions you process and the more bitcoins you make. However, the miners are also all checking each other to make sure they are honest and that the blockchain is valid.
If one person owns a very large chunk of the total mining power (hash rate) it means that they can "check their own work" and change the blockchain without the rest of the network knowing for some time. It's not good.

Bitcoin doesn't die- it just rests on its way to the moon!

I actually don't think a middle ground is a sustainable situation.
Let's assume that we are there- bitcoin has overtaken PayPal as a way to pay for stuff online. Every web site takes either credit card or bitcoin.
So, to buy something online with bitcoin I need to get some. I go over to a website like Coinbase and convert some fiat to bitcoin- okay that was out of the way when I could've just used my credit card, but whatever. Of course, I also lost money now to whatever fees that site sets. *Hopefully* the web vendor gives a discount to bitcoin users, but probably not. So, it is not preferable in this hypothetical scenario to use bitcoin.
However, maybe, you say, everyone already has some bitcoin. They use bitcoin for online purchases and cash for real life stuff. However, these two separated economies can't stay this way. For one, people who make all of their money online must trade bitcoins for fiat to pay for their "real life" purchases like food, rent, gas, taxes, etc (wouldn't it be nice if I didn't have to convert bitcoin to buy stuff that doesn't happen to be online?). Further, other people who don't make money on the internet, but in a "real life" office, will run out of bitcoins to use for online purchases, thus necessitating the scenario I outlined in the last paragraph (guess I'll just use my credit card instead).
Another point is that bitcoin will be deflationary at some point in the future. If I have half fiat and half bitcoin, why wouldn't I start trying to accept bitcoin at my garage sales or encourage my employer to pay me in bitcoin? Why wouldn't I convert as much fiat as I could into bitcoin? If bitcoin becomes so successful that everybody uses it online, it is inevitable, IMO, that it will be used in the "real life" economy as well.
Unless of course, the governments all change course and make the fiat currency pegged to bitcoin. But at that point, haven't we won already?
So, I don't see bitcoin as being online-only for very long. It will either:
1. Not be as convenient or cheap as credit cards and will fizzle and die.
2. Or be so successful as an online currency that it will necessarily become a standard real world currency.
Also, I don't believe that it will actually be bitcoin that makes it that far. Bitcoin is like the AOL of cryptocurrencies. Something better will come along that can handle the transaction volumes necessary.

There are a couple of reasons. With wider adoption, bitcoin's price will be less speculation-based and more usefulness-based. There will be fewer people buying and selling just on the idea of becoming rich with it.
Right now, there is only one thing to trade with bitcoin: fiat money. Some day if/when bitcoin is much more popular, the value of bitcoin will also be "pegged" in some sense to the price of eggs, coffee, entertainment, etc. Because of the increased volume of "real" trade with many different commodities, the price of bitcoin, relative to these things will stabilize.
Also, even just having higher volume on the exchanges today, would stabilize the price. If you look at the charts, the price can climb or fall based on very few trades. If the volume were much higher, there would be more sellers for each buyer and vice versa, meaning that the price would have a harder time moving by large amounts very quickly. Larger volumes of trades around a certain price point make the average much harder to move.


Very true. This may be a concern. Really, the whole higher education system is so fucked up in the U.S. right now, I'm not sure if this will even matter in a few years. I don't have an answer for this concern, but here is some food for thought:
* If the government subsidizes loans, it could potentially charge a 0% interest rate.
* Bitcoin will reach 2% inflation some time between 2020 and 2025 (matching the dollar's inflation). It wont become really deflationary until much later than that. If our higher education system isn't at least undergoing serious reform by then, I'll be surprised. So the student loan issue might not be the same by then anyway.
* Maybe the cost of higher education will naturally go down by then as more and more people realize that it isn't worth the lifetime of debt that it already is. In some ways, the interest rate wont matter as much if the total *amount* of debt is much smaller. Even with inflation and the currently low interest rate on student loans, people will be paying them off forever, and that's mostly because of the total amount of debt.
So, I don't know. It's all very interesting. Something I argued with a friend of mine was that it doesn't matter what makes a "good currency" if the economists don't control the currency. They can say it's horrible as much as they want, and it might be true, but if that's what people choose to use, that's what's going to be the de facto currency.

Well said! I don't agree with everything you say, Eric, but I agree with this 100%.
We have to stay calm, rational, and civil in all discourse we have about bitcoin, even if it's just with your combative Uncle who keeps calling it a funny-money Ponzi scheme.
But that does not mean we shouldn't respond to the misinformation. We have to be diligent and try to explain it to people. I just explained the difference in motivation between "investing" in bitcoin and traditional stocks to someone in a different subreddit the other day. He just genuinely didn't get it.

It's not bitcoin's job to prevent scams anymore than it is email's job to prevent spam or the dollar's job to prevent scams.
If someone starts a bitcoin credit card service or bank, they can do that and add features that they and their customers want. Right now, buying with bitcoin should be treated like buying with cash.

No- they *were* insolvent. They crashed the market with their initial "Bitcoin is broken!" announcement so that they could begin buying back the coins that they lost.
They also make money from every transaction that happens on their exchange. So they've been making money for the last few weeks. With that money, they buy more coins, either from what's left on their exchange or from other exchanges.
Eventually, they will have enough bitcoin to reopen withdrawals. Then they'll reopen and say "See? Your bitcoins are all here. We've always been solvent!"
The longer it takes them to resume withdrawals, the more I believe my theory.

Libertarians always shoot themselves in the feet by being too long-sighted and idealistic.

In your ideal world, those advantages would be taken away. That's not likely to happen, so would you rather fight for that in the long-term while letting them abuse their position, or would you rather fight for that in the long-term while trying to moderate the bullshit in the short-term?

Could you do a couple?


This is not a reason that Bill Gates is worse than Steve Jobs. You haven't said anything. What has Mr. Gates *done* that is worse?
Your other point there is basically that Steve Jobs's company outperformed Mr. Gates's company. But what about when MS was outperforming AAPL? Was Bill the better person then?


Your industrious nature is a moot point. Your industrious nature gets you money. You then spend that money. Buying yourself a nice dinner does some amount of good by giving money to the workers of the fancy restaurant. But giving that same money to very poor people, even in the form of micro-loans, will surely help them more than you'd be helping the restaurant workers.
You're just trying to justify being selfish by trying to make it seem like it's actually better for the world if you are selfish. It just isn't true.


I don't think I said anything to warrant being called a zealot. I also think that this statement is vacuous. What is the colour that I'm not seeing? What did I say was worthless? I said that Apple doesn't value freedom and Steve Jobs was a jerk. I'm open to being convinced otherwise.

I agree with almost everything you said and I find it refreshing to see someone here who more-or-less shares my outlook. Most of the bitcoiners here on Reddit are big Ron Paul, right-libertarian types, with whom I disagree vehemently on some issues, like the value of market economics for anything and everything forever. Not that there is anything wrong with disagreeing with me, but it's easy to feel alienated when this sub starts to echo the same way as Although, you mention the idea of basic/guaranteed income as a new thing and it really isn't. It also isn't an entirely radical idea, it just seems like it in today's political landscape, but even President Nixon's administration seriously looked into implementing something like that.
I also think it's interesting that the quote you have for inflation says distributed fairly. We could have inflation take effect by just giving everyone a tax break each year and have the new printed money directly injected into the federal budget in lieu of that much tax from each person. That would be like mailing everyone their fraction of new money. That seems more fair than what we have, which is exactly why it isn't being done...
While I agree with your analysis, I don't really see how bitcoin helps with the situation. Do you think that it does?

This is all true. But bitcoin is in this weird space where it is very important to secure it- it's money.
It used to be relatively okay for someone to boot up their Windows 95 computer and get a virus, hire an IT guy to come fix it, and move on with their lives. But people didn't really do online banking much back then, etc.

What part of what I said are you trying to counter, exactly?
You can lower your nose for one second.
If bitcoin's adoption grows, it will become much more stable than it is. Bitcoin has some interesting and appealing features, so it is not unreasonable to think that people will start using it (once it gets more user friendly- again an issue with its age that will surely change over time). 
The more volume of trades, the more stable it will be. That's just math. It will have growing pains for a long time as governments decide whether or not they want to ban it, etc. But you don't have to attack the "financially illiterate amateurs."
And bitcoin's value comes from the security of the blockchain. Some people find that valuable. You don't have to. Just like some people find diamonds valuable, but I don't.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:30:22

If bitcoin is to go mainstream, errors like this can't occur. I've never had an error using a credit card to buy stuff from Amazon or even from using the dreaded PayPal to buy from eBay.
Bitcoin is in its early days, so things like this and other growing pains to are be expected. But let's not pretend that where we are right now is the finish line.

While I agree that bitcoin is risky, and I understand that you are trying to emphasize that point, I wish people would stop comparing it to straight-up gambling like lottery tickets or dice-rolling. I buy into bitcoin because I legitimately think it's a good idea, and I hope that others will think that too. I researched the idea of the blockchain, read the white paper, compared it to Western Union and banks, and see some potential. I didn't just *randomly* decide to spend my money on something. Again, it's obviously high risk, but it's not quite the same as flipping a coin.

This is actually less of a problem than the one I addressed. The reason bitcoin is so volatile is just because it's so new. If/when the adoption actually reaches a large portion of the population, it will stabilize. Right now, the market is still feeling out bitcoin and has very low volume compared to other currency pairs. When the adoption increases, it will absolutely stabilize.


A creditor is HUGELY favored today as well. The interest rate on my credit card is 18%. That's with the dollar's inflation of around 2-4%. That means an actual interest rate on wealth of 18-2 = 16%. If bitcoin had a deflation of 4%, then your credit card might charge 12% for a total wealth interest rate of 16%.
The deflation is only an issue for VERY low interest rate loans. Like, less than 5%.

If he did buy mining hardware, he was likely subscribed to a mining "pool" website. Are you able to access his computers? Specifically, you can check his browsing history and hopefully he had his browser save his password to the mining site he used. One of the biggest pools is ghash.io so try typing that into his browser and logging in- maybe his password is saved.
You can also log on to his computer and look for bitcoin programs: specifically look for Bitcoin-Qt, Armory, Electrum, or MultiBit. These are bitcoin "wallets" and there is a good chance he has some bitcoins if he has a wallet.
If you want to exchange them for dollars, you'll have to get an account with a bitcoin exchange. If you are in the U.S., Coinbase is your best bet. Make an account with them and read about bitcoin enough that you can transfer them to your Coinbase account. You should be able to then sell them to Coinbase right from their website.

already made several good points, but I'd like to expand on them a little bit.


Like Josh said, the reimbursement money has to come from somewhere. That somewhere is the other credit card users who did not have their money stolen.
The idea at play here is that credit cards are actually an ass-backwards way to pay for things when you think about it. When you give someone a credit card number you are saying "Here is complete access to take money from me up to whatever my credit limit is. Please only take what you are supposed to." **Obviously** we need to insure a system as faulty and stupid as that. And that insurance costs money.
That problem is only exacerbated by the fact that these companies are storing credit card numbers that can be stolen. When you pay with bitcoin, the merchant only sees your public address. They can give that to anybody and it wont matter. What good will it do for a criminal to steal 10,000 public keys? None, because they can't take money with just a public key.
It is relevant to bitcoin because this particular kind of flaw does not exist with bitcoin. And since both bitcoin and credit cards are forms of payment, it is perfectly relevant to post about competing forms of payment on the bitcoin subreddit.


No. If a merchant is storing bitcoins and they get hacked, **my** bitcoins are fine. **Their** bitcions are gone. I can feel safe buying from Tiger Direct with bitcoin because if they get hacked, the hacker can't take extra bitcoins from me. If I buy from Tiger Direct with a credit card and they get hacked, then the hacker can take more money from me.

Leftism is a much more diverse concept than rightism (not saying that in a derisive way). Leftism can mean government taxation and redistribution, etc., or worker ownership of the means of production, or public ownership of natural resources.

And a custom ROM developer inherits Google's best security measures. People aren't writing ROMs from scratch. They take AOSP and add in their own customizations and apps. This makes me think that you don't really know much about custom ROMs for Android.

It sounds like we need to define what value is. Maybe you're using a "financially literate" definition and I'm just using a colloquial definition.
It would seem to me that the value of a currency comes mostly from how it can be spent. If nobody but the U.S. government accepted dollars, it wouldn't be worth as much, right? Now of course, a giant, wealthy government, like the U.S.'s, controlling dollars and wanting them as tax payment, obviously would keep the dollar worth *something*. But this doesn't give the dollar *intrinsic* value (the government is just a big source of demand), like you seem to expect from bitcoin. It seems like you have a double standard: dollar's value comes from people using it, bitcoin's has to come from something intrinsic like a metal's value would.


Yes, you're right. What I meant to say was that as adoption increases (meaning more users and merchants accepting it), its trading volume will also increase, which will lead to price stability. Large trading volume will make the average price stable (assuming a relatively stable adoption).


Except that bitcoin is actually different than any other payment method/currency out there right now. If beanie babies were anything different from any other stuffed animal, it might be a better analogy.
And the rest of your points, I'll need to wait to reply to until you let me know what you mean by value. I genuinely don't know how to approach them otherwise.

Many reasons. It's the way it is today. You can say that we don't have a free market system, but we do have some form of market capitalism and worker wages are a race to the bottom. The more you pay your workers, the less profit you take, the less your stocks are worth, the less money you have as owner/CEO. People do awful things to each other in the name of "smart economics."
This is especially true with unemployment as high as it is. There will always be someone desperate enough to take a job for $3/hr, setting the bar lower for everyone.
I think this is an old Chris Rock joke, but look at minimum wage. If your employer is paying you minimum wage, she is effectively saying "I would pay you even less, but it'd be illegal."
There is just no way whatsoever that we can keep a market capitalist economy and have wages go up. Wages haven't gone up since the 1970's, and no amount of capitalism will make them now.


Not true. Human beings need to cooperate to survive. Direct competition is arguably less natural than cooperation for humans. The human tribes that survived the best worked together the best. Early human societies never had trade within their tribe- it was much closer to the classic description of communism. Today, we live in a small world and our "tribe" should be the whole world- or at least a country.


Rightists love it when the government-funded police department kicks a squatter off of their unused land or vacant house. Let's not pretend that the left has some disproportionate love for the state. And let's be fair: we pretty much all like it when the serial rapist/murderer is kept away from the rest of society- though I sincerely wish is was less about punishment and more about rehab, but that's a different issue.


Let me address this from two points:
1. Are you not disagreeing with my point that private ownership of natural resources is bad? I said that it's bad because it encourages people to hoard it lest someone else does. You merely reply by saying that taxes do the same thing. Does that mean that you agree with my point?
2. For the record, I do agree with you that taxes are generally bad. However, I don't buy your particular argument(s).
If welfare makes people less charitable, why was there more hunger and poverty before these programs were in place? Clearly, before welfare and government spending ramped up after the Great Depression, people had much more control of their money- why didn't they spend it on helping the less fortunate? After welfare and unemployment programs were started, poverty decreased, meaning people were spending more of their money on feeding people than before.
And your assertion that people take advantage of these welfare programs is confusing to me. If they qualify for these programs, they are supposed to take advantage of them- that's why they were created. If you've ever met someone who is on disability or welfare, you'd know that it's a shitty life of always wondering if they will renew your support or drop you for some technicality. Not to mention, the paperwork is (probably intentionally) intimidating for people who are less educated.
All that said, I don't think that government programs on top of capitalism are going to solve the fundamental unfairness in capitalism. I think that the system needs to be adapted such that a wealthy person or his offspring don't automatically have leverage against a less wealthy person. The only way I see that happening is in a system where the state does not use tax money to violently enforce a selfish person's claim to a natural resource or idea.

Leftist philosophy has a lot of depth that I'm not going to do justice, but so be it. Please consider this the class description in the syllabus for "Leftism 101" and not the real content.
Worker ownership of the means of production literally means that workers/employees get a stake in the company for which they work. That workers get some *say* in how their work environment runs and how the profit is spent.
Now, the typical right-libertarian will say "But what if the worker entered into a consensual contract with the owner of the company to only get a salary or wage and not get those other things?" or "Why doesn't the person who wants that just find a company to work for that will offer that? Nobody is forcing him to take a bad job." That would be all well and good, except that we all know that no one in their right mind would take the crappy job if they didn't feel like they had to. And when a jobless person is negotiating with an employer, we know who has the leverage in the bargaining. *Since the employer already has wealth, he then has the leverage to extort more wealth from someone who has less wealth without doing any extra labor himself.* It is this kind of "old money advantage" that leftists often take issue with when it comes to capitalism. From a leftist lens, there is quite a bit of "wealth redistribution" in capitalism in the form of capitalists (those who own capital) taking profit from labor that they aren't performing, even if they had once performed labor under a similar shitty deal to get where they are now.
The second and third points kind of go together because they are about natural resources. Let me start with the third and the "public ownership of natural resources" will make sense.


But it is both force and theft. Presumably, nobody owned that piece of water until he found it. This must have been true at some point in history as human beings evolved. Surely there was a time where no natural resource was claimed by anyone and was just shared by whatever sub-human monkey thing was strolling by and got thirsty.
At some point, this dude found the lake or whatever and decided that from that point on, he was the only one allowed to take water from it. Who gave him the right to do this? Who consented to this contract? Who *would*?
I posit that the logic goes like this, in short: Lake was owned by nobody, therefore, was owned by everybody (in the sense that everyone had equal right to drink from it or swim in it, etc). Then this guy took access away from everybody, which is only possible by threat of force (how else would he enforce his "ownership"?). In that sense it is both theft in that it used to belong to everybody, and force in that it's the only way to enforce his ownership.
Not to mention, this idea of "I found it first, so I own it" is incredibly unfair unless everyone was born at exactly the same time and had equal chance of staking a claim. Why should people who are older automatically be better off than people who are younger?
So, the whole ownership of natural resources is a tough issue, but I think that a pragmatic leftist in the modern world would support something along the lines of nationalized resource mining (e.g., many countries, and actually the state of Alaska, gives citizens a cut of the profits from oil production).
Again, this is a really short, shallow description of the basic idea, tinged with my own feelings. There is a lot to learn from leftist thinkers like Kropotkin, Marx, Bakunin, etc. Just don't think that left = American Democratic Party, high taxes, and Welfare.

I have to disagree that it's borderline useless. The only sense in which that is true, in my opinion, is that soon our phone cameras and software will be so good that we'll be able to just scan actual text with them. Although, I think QR codes have some redundant bits to check for errors, so scanning the actual text might be less reliable.
And as difficult as you make it sound to grab a QR (and I'm sure it is, from an engineering point of view), I've never had a problem. The worst part is keeping still long enough for my camera to focus, which sometimes takes a few seconds- still way shorter than typing in a BTC address, for sure.

Only if the coin starts off as POS. Peercoin started with the exact same POW algorithm as bitcoin and has become more and more POS as time goes on. Something like that seems like the best way to do POS. 
Now, what I guess is possible is to end up with a feedback loop where a wealthy person gets many PPC and then starts minting, making more and more coins. But then that means that he/she cannot spend his coins (30 day aging time for PPC). Also, a wealthy person can go out and buy up a mining farm with POW anyway, so the rich getting richer is going to happen for either, it seems.

The interest rate you pay on your bank loans or credits cards is much higher than inflation today. That's because the entity that loaned you money doesn't just want a higher number of dollars from you later, they want to profit, which means beating inflation.
If inflation is 2%, then nobody will ever loan you money for 2% or less. Your credit card's interest right now is probably around 18%- quite a bit higher.
The same principles would exist with deflation, but the results would obviously be different. It's hard to say whether it would be better or worse, although most economists today will tell you it would be worse.
If money had a 2% deflationary tendency, then a credit card company would charge you some ~14% interest instead of the 18% they are charging now. In either case, debt sucks.

It depends what you're meaning when you say stabilize. Like I said, dollars are not perfectly stable. They do not lose value at *exactly* the goal of 2% per year (or whatever it is). They change value based on a global market.
The government does try to manipulate it to a certain value of inflation, so it can be pretty close to stable.

Yes, this has been done. Sometimes successfully, sometimes not. However, the reason it would be hard for this endeavor to succeed is because there are other businesses who wouldn't subscribe to this philosophy. They will pay their workers peanuts and make them work in shitty conditions, thus increasing profit. The worker-run industry will almost definitely be less profitable *as long as the majority of wealth is held by a relative few*. Or at least as long as humans are treated as a commodity to be bought and sold according to supply and demand.
I feel like a healthy compromise in our current society would be a guaranteed basic income (Then workers would have leverage when interacting with a potential employer. You could do away with minimum wage and work-hour regulations, have a flat income tax (which, with the BI, would, de facto, actually be progressive), etc. You'd have *more* free market, with more humanity and worker dignity and self-determination.

There's more to it than that even. McDonald's also doesn't update their prices every day to account for the USD's performance versus other currencies across the world. If they did, that hamburger would change price by a few cents every day. Also, McDonald's will decrease the size of their hamburgers in order to still offer something for $1 on their menu. You are not getting the same amount of hamburger for $1 today as a few years ago unless they are choosing to not take as much profit anymore.
And bitcoin will stabilize if/when it gets big. More liquidity means it'll be harder to move the price because there will be more buyers/sellers for a small price movement. Why do you think that big stocks on the NYSE don't fluctuate nearly as much as bitcoin on short time scales?

Here's the thing, though. Because of this Gox nonsense, other exchanges have started promising to publish quarterly reports to "prove" their solvency. I know it's a tired meme in but this actually is good news in the long term. Gox's fuck up has made everyone else better.


Right now, almost everyone holding (any significant amount of) bitcoin have a basic understanding of it. Why do you think the price only dropped for a couple of hours when Gox went dead? Bitcoin will only die if the protocol is shown to be massively flawed.
I agree that if the mainstream public were already using bitcoin, things like Gox could've effectively killed it. But that's not the case. No Joe Schmoe are really using bitcoin, so Gox will just be a blip on the radar.
In a year or two, more Joe Schmoes will be cruising the internet and see some story on bitcoin and say "Wait, that thing is still around? Hm." And that's when it'll start, IMO.
Right now, all these things that seem devastating are really not. Any flaw or issue that comes to light and gets fixed is good right now.

Nobody really controls the value of the dollar. It floats against other currencies the same way that bitcoin does.
The fed controls the amount of dollars, just like the bitcoin protocol controls the number of bitcoins.
The only reason the dollar is relatively stable is because so many people use it. That can be forced because the government can just make its citizens use it. Bitcoin can't do that. Thus is can only stabilize with voluntary adoption.
And you can't possibly "bake in" a dollar conversion rate via software. That doesn't make sense. You make it so that bitcoins can't leave a wallet without checking that a certain number of dollars make it to a bank account?

I'm not totally sure. Like I said- I'm not sure that I have a good working definition of "progressive." As far as I know, progressives are not against private ownership of the means of production, and therefore are not *for* the state ownership of the means of production. So, I doubt that any self-identified progressive would say that a model like China or N. Korea is good.
I'm sure that I would not call them communist, though. Just because a political party calls itself communist does not make it so. China's leading party could change its name to the "Capitalism Libertarian Party" tomorrow and it wouldn't magically make their policies jive with free market capitalism...

Look at you- having a discussion with me. Almost like that was the point.
But anyway, you certainly have a point about Gox customers having a chance at being whole.
However, Gox lost half a billion dollars worth of bitcoins. It seems more likely to me that Gox will come back to life with the old customers having shares. It will struggle to regain market share and at the end of the day, they are not going to be able to pay back their customers AND we will see the reputation of bitcoin hurt even further by everyone keeping eyes on Gox's performance and equating it with bitcoin (just like last time). At the end, I think it's way more likely that we are all going to lose as opposed to just the Gox customers.
Like you said, if they succeed it will be because they became an awesome exchange somehow. But how much better would Gox have to be than every other exchange to move past their reputation at this point? Is it at all feasible?

I think you are likely correct, though I do think that you are slightly understating the cleverness that a young computer scientist can have.

It all depends on what the rate of deflation actually is. The dollar is inflationary, but Starbuck's doesn't update its prices every day, right? You have to update occasionally, but not necessarily constantly.


In a way, yes. But, just like people save dollars today in spite of the fact that they will buy less stuff tomorrow, people will still spend bitcoin when it's deflationary. It all depends on the amount of deflation. If it's only a small to moderate amount of deflation, then it might just cut down on some of the most frivolous spending, which, in my opinion, will probably be better for the environment anyway.

You could, yes. But dollars cannot both be digital and under your own control. Bitcoin can.
If you keep your cash in "cold storage" you wont be able to pay for things online or pay your bills/rent. You obviously can't pay your bills or rent in bitcoin yet, but not as a matter of physical limitation. Someday you could.

If you don't want the BTC donation to be conspicuous, so as to not inadvertently lessen donations, maybe you can just have the official Wiki donate BTC address at the bottom of Wikipedia pages all the time.
You know, down where the creative commons license statement goes or right above the contact info link.
Plus you can just leave it there 24/7/365 and people will probably donate every once in a while when they find an article that was especially useful to them.

Don't get me wrong- it would be great if people could get their Goxcoins back.
But right now, when people are asking/thinking about bitcoin and they hear about Gox, we can say, truthfully, that it was a shitty exchange and we all knew they were shady for at least a year. They're gone now: cut out like a cancer.
But if Gox comes back? Well, that shitty exchange that we all knew was bad is back, but this time it will be different- we promise.
I'm talking about perception here. Gox could come back as the best exchange ever, but the perception of an ecosystem where Gox is allowed to survive is not very good, IMO.

Anonymous means not identifying. What part of tracing to a bunch of addresses will couple it to my identity? I agree that it's *public*, but I feel like it can be both public and anonymous.
If I'm careful, how could anyone trace it back to *me*? I don't care if someone sees an address on a ledger (1xid7adbfd8hlj3291dnfdu does not give anyone any information about me as a person).


And I don't see how any of those things matter for anonymity. Sure, maybe Coinbase will make their addresses publicly linked to them, but who cares? If you were trying to stay anonymous and your bitcoin eventually makes it to Coinbase, how can anyone trace it to *you* in real life (assuming you weren't the one who sent it to coinbase)? I'm assuming that we are *trying* to stay anonymous.

While you are right about that, it is decreasingly a concern for two reasons:
1. You could do something like Casascius coins where the private key is only revealed by "scratch-off" or equivalent tamper-proof technology. You could trade physical bitcoins this way. However, you'd have to trust the minting company to not keep the private keys. Casascius imparts trust by being a registered business and by allowing everyone to know his real identity and information. If the coins prove to be a scam, there is at least legal recourse. You might have to worry about counterfeit bitcoins, but I'm not sure why that would be any worse than the current threat of counterfeit dollars.
2. The internet is only becoming more and more accessible. The likelihood of having no internet connection is increasingly diminishing, especially in the first world. I personally pay all of my bills online and so far have not missed a payment because of no internet connection. 
@_date: 2014-04-22 22:06:17
Exactly. And that cryptocurrency will have learned from bitcoin's experience. Perhaps it will have some kind of blockchain pruning enabled from launch. Maybe a block size limit that changes with the hashrate of the network, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-22 03:44:09
Isn't part of that from finding new gold mines? Gold is a shitty currency because we have no idea what the supply actually is. At least with bitcoin, we know what the maximum useable supply is at any moment.
In that way, it's very different from gold. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 12:26:30


It's not magic at all. It's the order books on exchanges that will stabilize it. If I want to go buy a bunch of bitcoin right now with $1million, I could completely wipe out the order books on an exchange (that's a made up number and I don't know if that's true for that particular dollar amount). This means that I will buy every bitcoin that is for sale at $585 and will start buying into sells at $600, then $615, etc, etc. That will drive the price up. If there is more trading volume (and yes, the price would also have to be higher to help stabilize it), it will move less when I make my purchase. The same works in the other direction. 
Then when the price does move in one direction, there are also more people who are going to take profit or scoop "cheap coins" at whatever value. Just having more people/money in the game will necessarily damp the price oscillation.
It will probably never stabilize quite as much as the dollar, but like I said- the dollar isn't perfectly stable either. And it might become "stable enough."


That's a terrible example, though. Beef prices are affected by the prices of a lot of other things as well, including the recent droughts (in the U.S. anyway). Droughts will not affect the overall value of bitcoin. Something that can influence the price of bitcoin would be the cost electricity.

And you need to back up your claim that we can't donate to feed people for less than $1 per calorie. And if that claim is true, we should be giving poor people food directly- in other words it doesn't make my point about you being selfish (and trying to act like it's good) any less valid.
@_date: 2014-05-03 19:14:06
The one argument that really breaks my heart is the "too volatile" argument. How in the world would people expect a grass roots currency to instantly be stable? How can anything decentralized immediately be stable? So few people in the world have any bitcoins at all, of course the price isn't going to be stable.
And then there is this cop-out that I always hear, which Eisinger almost uses as well: "Well, the technology is good (the blockchain), but as a currency it wont work." That's trying to have their cake and eat it too. They want to agree with the VIPs who say it wont work, but they don't actually understand why it wont work when talking to a bitcoiner, so they try to hedge their figurative bet.
The blockchain, as it stands, really is only going to work if there is a currency reward attached to it. So, if bitcoin fails as a currency, then the blockchain will also fail. You can't have it both ways.

While I disagree with your point about altcoins, I don't think you should be downvoted.
A problem with open source is that developers can mooch. In my opinion, this is a necessary evil because the hope with (F(L))OSS is that someone will take the code and make it better.
That doesn't suddenly make mooching okay, it just makes it *allowed*.
On the other hand, some altcoins are legitimately innovative: Peercoin, Namecoin, Mastercoin, Protoshares, Primecoin, etc. That outweighs any lameness from copycoins, IMO.

I don't think that the concept is really all that complicated. I mean, there's a lot of stuff to say, so it will take more than 30 seconds to explain to someone, but I don't think it's terribly complex to explain the mining process and how that makes "cheating" impossible.
This, of course, depends on their patience. And if you really want to get in to the nitty-gritty of how the hashes are chosen, what Tx malleability is, 51% attacks, etc., it gets more complicated. But the "big picture" isn't that hard, IMO.

Nope. That's why I didn't.

A lot of people keep saying this as though it makes it better: "The 51% attack wouldn't last very long. Everyone would see what's happening and move their miners then everything will be peachy."
It is **not** okay to have the network being completely unreliable for any period of time, let alone the few hours, at least, that it would take to resolve it. Do you really think that Bitcoin can become a useful currency when there is a decent chance that your $1million business deal might get totally fucked because that just happened to be during a 51% attack?
The 51% thing is a really big deal, but it rains on our parade so people try to downplay it.

Not really. It's not like you get 0% loans in fiat, do you? Fiat loans always charge more than the rate of inflation, so you end up owing more over time.
For example, credits cards are what, 18%? So, take off 2% inflation (what it's 'supposed' to be for the USD) and you still have 16%. If BTC deflates at 5%, then the credit card company could charge 11% interest and still take the same amount of wealth from you.
Of course, these things will only be reasonably settled once the price of BTC stabilizes. I doubt BTC will appreciate by 1000%/yr forever...

On the other hand, this is what we have to deal with now. You can either have it break more or break less in the short term and have a very high probability that it will stay in whichever state we choose forever.


That's exactly my point. People are pushing to legalize same-sex marriage and all the (white, heterosexual, middle class) Libertarians sit around and refuse to get behind it because the government shouldn't be involved in marriage at all. That's fine and dandy, except that they **are** involved and they **are** giving preference to a group of citizens over another and Libertarians refuse to fight in any meaningful way. 
Fight for equality, then fight for abolishing legal marriage if you want one does not prevent the other. All they do is perpetuate the inequality until they reach their ideal goal, which may or may not *ever* happen. Why not get something done now that is good, so that people can at least be equal while you're fighting the longer fight?

My history is a little vague- I used to be more versed in OS history- myself being a big Linux/BSD fan.
If I recall, the whole point of the Apple computer was that consumers were basically too dumb to want to build their own computer from parts. They wouldn't want or need to upgrade parts, etc. Now, to be fair, they were pretty much correct on that, but that doesn't mean freedom to me.
Part of my disdain from Apple is actually a disdain for Steve Jobs. The guy was an asshole. He kind of scammed Woz out of his share of the company after Woz's motorcycle accident, he completely killed off Apple's charity donations when he took over after NeXT, with the excuse that the company couldn't afford it. That would've been a decent excuse at the time, but what about once Apple became the most profitable company in the world?  
Then, he insults Bill Gates, whose company bailed out Apple in I think '97(?). Way to bite the hand, asshat.
And finally, the moron had the only treatable kind of pancreatic cancer, but decided that instead of treating it with medicine, he would drink tea and wave crystals so that he could die and leave his daughters behind.

I'm not totally anti-regulation, but these pro-regulation posts in regards to the Gox situation usually don't make good points.
Unregulated does not mean theft is okay. It's not like I can open a Bitcoin business tomorrow, accept a bunch of deposits, and then close up shop and take the bitcoins. Law enforcement will be after me, not because bitcoin is regulated, but because I stole people's stuff.
And of course, regulation doesn't guarantee much either. I live in Florida. Several years ago, when all the really bad hurricanes devastated the state, the house insurance companies that we had been paying for decades for just such an occasion just up and left! "Oops.

I'll be honest: I only watched about 10 minutes of this before I got bored out of my mind. I had the same two thoughts for the entire part that I watched:
1. The obsession with gold that people have is weird. So what if I can go exchange my currency for gold? What the hell am I going to do with gold? Eat it? Build something out of it? Why is it assumed that gold prices wont ever go to zero? I know that gold is a decent conductor that doesn't corrode very quickly, but what if materials scientists find another material that does that even better? In any case, having currency as a middle-man between you and the thing with value doesn't seem any better than the currency itself being the thing of value. We, bitcoiners, are basically directly trading gold.
2. Yes, bitcoin is volatile now- because it hasn't become widely adopted yet. Obviously, if/when it becomes mainstream and has a really huge market cap., it will stabilize. Oh, and of course, the price of gold was never unstable, right?

People are simply predicting a crash because the price has been rising so quickly the last few weeks.
People think that a sharp rise in price *has* to be followed by a crash.

To be fair, many more merchants have jumped on board since $200. That makes bitcoin more valuable, IMO.
@_date: 2013-12-03 15:03:17
But you realize that having 1 BTC doesn't *mean* anything, right? You can't physically count your BTC. I tried, very gently, suggesting to my father-in-law that the number 1.0000 is no less arbitrary than 1.0001 or .000324 when it comes to digital stuff.
But that really doesn't mean much I guess. People want a "whole" one. I guess we really do need to go toward using millibits. Think that you have almost 500 millibits!
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:00:42
Unfortuntely, I am not familiar with that term. Is it basically the fact that when your money is in a bank, they are able to loan it out while you're not using, thereby effectively doubling that much money (one factor is still owned by you, the other is being spent by the bank)?
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:41:08
As opposed to objectivity.
If .5 BTC "feels" different than 500 mBTC, then there is something incorrect in your thinking, because it is not, in fact, different.
@_date: 2013-11-12 23:23:28
I guess. But for now you can make the tech savvy argument for bitcoins too, no?
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:27:54
Because humans think incorrectly.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:34:47
That is a good point, but at the same time, you don't have to trust the miner. And if one miner doesn't pick your transaction up, another will. If you have a bank account with Bank of America and you try to send money and they don't want to let you (or the government stops them, etc), then you can't just have another bank transfer that money for you, because you can't even access it.

So you're saying that if something has N uses instead of N+1 uses, it wont be less popular?
I should've clarified that I meant *copyrighted* file sharing. Obviously some file sharing is still legal.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:00:55
First, you'll see that I still advocate switching to mBTC, *because* humans are stupid.
Wrong is not relative.
.5 BTC = 500 mBTC
If you say that people will buy one and not the other, they are doing something wrong. Their math skills can't overcome their lizard brains. Their ability to *objectively* evaluate a financial situation is compromised. As in, they aren't using logic. Logic is not subjective.
And I never said that there weren't possible advantages to us having evolved this way. But that doesn't mean we are somehow correct in thinking that .5 BTC doesn't equal 500 mBTC.

Can you expand on this? Consider me a plebe, but in a normal portfolio, what would be considered a correlated asset?
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:52:56
But wouldn't the hashing power be more spread out overall? As in more people doing the mining? It would be harder to get 51% of a lot of people to agree than it would be to get 51% of a few people who run most of the miners, no?
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:10:48
It's true that the altcoins attract those scuzzy people, but some of us are genuinely interested in some of them.
Some coins are actually innovative in some ways. Look at Namecoins, Protoshares, Peercoins to some extent, Primecoins, Securecoins (less rigged version of Quark).
I find that each of these brings something interesting to the table.
Some of us don't think that Bitcoin is the final cryptocurrency, and I'm watching out for what I think might be next.
Bitcoin's mining difficulty makes me worry about a potential 51% attack in the future. Also the 10 minute block time is inconvenient sometimes. Then, we have to wonder if the NSA backdoored SHA256.
If Quark had a better reward scaling, it really could've been cool, IMO. Securecoin is basically the same thing but with the same "economy" as Bitcoin, meaning same number of coins and new coin per year rate.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:23:57
Look, government can't destroy bitcoin, but it can sure as shit tell businesses that they can't exchange bitcoins.
That's all it would take to make bitcoin nearly useless. China has basically banned it now; if the U.S. follows, it's basically done.
You aren't going to get "average Joe" to start using bitcoin if this happens, even in other countries because who's to say that their government wont be the next to ban it?

It's not, anyway.


It's way riskier to buy drugs online than to buy from your local dealer. You have to be very savvy to be undetected on the internet.


Drug trade probably isn't as big a use of bitcoin as you think.
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:28:59
Maybe yes. It's hard to say. But color me skeptical.
But the largest two economies explicitly banning a financial asset is not good for it. Modern economy companies are increasingly multinational- if they can't do business with China or U.S.A. in bitcoin, I doubt that they will go out of their way to support it.
Now, if somehow *every other* country supported it, it might be worth it for these companies to do.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:31:48
Isn't that the premise of Namecoin? Use that network hashing to basically do DNS?
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:54:52


It isn't explicitly built in, but it is part of it in the sense that people lose coins all the time, and will continue to do so.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:25:19
Yeah, quark is a shame because I actually like some of the stuff it brags about: very fast blocks, 6 different hashes (so when it's revealed that the NSA backdoored 3 of them, it's still secure), no set number of coins (may piss off hardcore austrians but it'll make up for lost coins and probably keep the price more predictable).
But, then you find out that some 90% of the coins were mined in a few weeks and could be dumped any minute...

I didn't see/hear it as I've not been following BTC news for the last few days.

Well, the NSA comment was just kind of off the cuff. I haven't really thought about what one could do if they could crack the hashing algorithm.
As far as the 51% and the difficulty- my thought process is that if mining is so hard and so expensive, you're only going to be left with a handful of people/companies doing it. It would be relatively easy for enough of them to collude if there are only 10 miners left who are able to make a profit.
@_date: 2013-12-16 03:46:43
It all depends on the recipient- just like any gift.
I'm planning on making some custom paper wallets with a family photo on them and giving them to a couple of my relatives. But, they are the kind of people that wont get mad at me if bitcoin suddenly isn't worth anything. They'll appreciate that I went through the effort to design something for them and that I even loaded it with some money (I'll probably do around $20 worth of bitcoin).

@_date: 2013-11-12 03:12:11
Okay, yes, I was aware of how this worked- I just never heard the term "money multiplier effect."
But, what I'm not totally convinced of yet, is that inflation is worse for poor people than for wealthy people. Like you said: inflation is bad for saving. But, if a poor person only has 1% of his/her money left after bills, and a rich person has on the order of 50% of his/her money left after necessities, doesn't that mean rich people are "encouraged" to pump more money into the system than the poor person? Thus giving the poor people (as a population) more opportunities to obtain new money (than rich people as a population)?
EDIT: Although, rich people will always have better resources to improve their "money-getting" power, so maybe the fact that more money is flowing is still more opportunity for them to get it. I don't know...
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:35:19

I wouldn't have agreed with you until I spoke with my father-in-law this weekend. He seemed pretty stoked on the idea of just throwing $500 into Bitcoin and checking on it again in a few months/years, but now he's holding out for it to crash to $500 again so he can "get a whole one."
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:13:07
I was right there with you last night. I loved the idea of getting a cut of the trading fees, the website looked nice, it had my favorite altcoins- it was great.
Luckily, I did not buy any mcxFEEs. I was able to get all of my coins out of there (for a fucking fee- what an asshole he is for not turning off the fee) and now have them in an encrypted wallet on my computer. I am in the process of backing up my wallets as well.
So, I moved there to get some interest on my cryptocoins, and I ended up losing more from withdrawing last night than I made in interest. But, I've learned my lesson and still came out *almost* totally unscathed, unlike the poor people who bought mcxFEEs.
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:25:00
Yes, but the point is that there is plenty of room for growth. 1 BTC could be worth $1 million and then a satoshi would be one cent.

In that light, it's purely a market exchange and has nothing to do with capitalism or socialism.
Even factoring in the ownership of the miner, since you aren't hiring someone else to "run" the miner for you, it's still compatible with socialism.

Are you sure about this? I mean, poor people really can't save whether they want to or not. Rich people, on the other hand, have enough money to cover all their needs and more. Inflation forces them to at least invest their leftover money or buy stuff with it.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:39:56
I guess, but do you think that getting a bunch of people in is really going to pump the price that much? I mean, first of all, most of us in this sub are already holding. And even still, I just don't think we'd have enough volume to actually drive the price up very high.
Unless you think he's hoping that the "news" will spread from Reddit.

Until they restrict that too. You really can't have any faith that the ones in power wont do everything they have to to protect their positions. It would be relatively easy, I bet, to restrict the internet in most Western countries. You'd have to just do what England and Australia have/are trying.

No, I get psychology. Just because something has been studied and shown to exist doesn't mean that it isn't dumb. Addiction can also be psychological, but that doesn't mean it isn't bad. Something can be psychological *and* bad or stupid. (I am not saying that people with addictions are stupid, BTW)
If our brains are wired in such a way that feelings trump mathematical understanding and cause us to take actions that a perfect robot wouldn't take, I'd say our psychology is causing us to be dumb. We're dumb, IMO.

I would love to believe this- can you enlighten me?
I just don't see how that would happen. The well-connected are always going to be able to make deals that disproportionately benefit them. In fact, with bitcoin, it would be easier for these guys to do "back room" deals. I don't see how the adage of "money begets money" would be any less true with BTC as a currency.
It wont prevent insider trading, oligopolies, rent-seeking, collusion (shit- look at all this pump-n-dump shit happening with the altcoins. That's supposed to be illegal, but nobody can stop it).
I mean, unless you think that Bitcoin will spark a social revolution, which I am hopeful for as well. But, in that case, it wouldn't be the currency that matters, it would be, well, society.
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:37:54


To be fair, that isn't what happens at all. Those people typically either regurgitate stuff they read from a WSJ article about "tulips" or "deflationary spirals" and have no idea what either of those even are, **or** they cite how volatile the price is as a reason it can't be currency. Oh, a new technology with barely any adoption has a volatile price? Gee, why don't they hire you at The Economist?
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:53:37


Honest question: Why is debt and spending and inflation such a good thing?
Here is where I'm coming from: Look at the rate at which we are destroying our planet. Every single year a new iPad or smart phone comes out that does maybe one trivial feature (hardware-wise) better than the last generation (I'm thinking the Galaxy S4 having an IR blaster compared to the S3). So what do we do? We buy that one and throw the other in a landfill. Not only is that bad for the environment in sooo many ways, it also means that the labor that went into building that device is now worthless.
Inflation accelerates that process. Debt not only allows more businesses to come into existence, but *does* in fact encourage people to spend even more, using up more and more of our natural resources. And for what?
Let's face it: the most important inventions don't come from companies pumping out toys to be sold on the market. Things like penicillin, the internet, lasers, medicine, the steam engine, water filtration, computers, satellites, etc, came from scientists in universities or government labs. It's not like less wasteful consumption will send us back into the stone age. Not that it matters if we destroy our planet and waste all of our fuel and kill our space programs so we're trapped here.
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:39:34
It's not just you. That's just how people are. Frankly, bitcoin is not a great currency yet. You are hard-pressed to be able to spend it unless you go out of your way to shop from certain retailers.
So, it's not surprising that they don't value it for what it is.
On the other hand, it does attract libertarian types. My father-in-law is a libertarian (I am not) and when I was explaining it to him, I emphasized the things that I knew he would appreciate: no authority can inflate it at will, anonymity, etc. He, unsurprisingly, thought it seemed appealing. 
It also helps that I am a physics PhD student, so anything nerdy/mathy that I have faith in, he automatically assumes must be legit. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:17:11
OH SNAP
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:19:38
Maybe because there is no "whole thing" with bitcoin. At all. With something digital and non-physical, there is nothing special about the number 1.0000 vs. the number 0.54839. It's kind of stupid.
Am I a jerk? Maybe.
But if 500 mBTC = .5 BTC and people are willing to buy it one way and not the other... well, it's stupid. Psychological barrier or not.
That being said, I completely support the movement to using mBTC precisely because this is a real effect.
