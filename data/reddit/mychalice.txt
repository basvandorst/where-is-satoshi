If Btc goes to 1m ( within the next few years) we are nearing or in hyperinflation

Well keep an eye out for people who know about crypto. Stealing your crypto and sending to multiple addresses sounds like someone who knows his/her stuff.

Did someone you know take your phone?

No one really knows where Bitcoin came from. Totally possible the whole thing is a push towards a cashless society. We will eventually hit a cashless society IMO. Best way for the government to control us.

They are sad because the price went up further than they thought.

Giving out any Gov info shouldn't be taken lightly. Don't give out SSN or other info to unrepped sites or atms.

Amen! And run a node!

With better tech hashrates will go up.

I don't pay attention to him. I've known about him for years.

It's been so long! You MIGHT only get the dollar sum back, but not at today's current price. You would get cash value at the time MTgox was hacked.
Amazing to see how much has changed in the last 10 years when it comes to exchanges.

Bitcoin is not at an all time high. Equities at an all time high. Buy low sell high.
@_date: 2019-09-12 19:33:42
Wait for the interest rate to go down at least. I wouldn't though

Running nodes and having mining rigs further decentralizes

BCH and TRON are dying. Trying to do tricks everywhere!
@_date: 2019-09-14 20:39:50
Well first, where has money been historically made? US Mints which are in states.

I know a story of a few tech billionaires that sold out at 3k, lol

Alt coins are going to bring down BTC for awhile

Ransom? For what?
@_date: 2019-09-16 15:56:26
We need to recreate "Pink" sweatpants but with Bitcoin instead.

Not in the immediate term but if you hold the btc when prices go way up you'll be fine.
Also knowing what you spend on electricity is a big deal. If you spend less than 10 cents a Kw you can make money, but it's going to take some time. Check CryptoCompare's website for their calculator.
@_date: 2019-09-16 17:31:30
Not a bad idea
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:35:02
For now

Technically you can't use another currency for legal tender. Constitution

How about a card with a paper wallet inside. Let's be honest, not many care about the design.

What was the dominance then?
