No Satoshi Blockchain?  I'm very curious to hear your solution, how long will you tease?

Server is now mirrored more places, please let us know if its still a problem.

So really this is a whole lot of hype for something that doesn't even have a functional concept down on paper?  Have you actually solved the problems you see, or are you just mostly looking for people to help you solve them?

He's commenting on how many longstanding members of the bitcoin community folding up shop in the middle of the night, taking all their customers bitcoins held within with them.   I don't really know how you could avoid something like that, people just have to learn, and it has to get easy.

Why now?  Seems pretty early in Bitcoins lifecycle to spin up the next big thing, why re-invent the wheel when you've got a functional skeleton in Bitcoin for any kind of variation or tweak?   
You mention scalability - How do you propose to solve it?

The currency is decentralized.  The problem is that people have no real idea how to take responsibility for themselves, so they say "Hey that company probably will do a better job than I can" and leave it there because if they get stolen, at least it's not their own fault (so the logic goes).    
Theres no safety net with Bitcoin, it's just you.   Amusingly, this would be a fraction of the problem it is if there wasn't all this legal uncertainty around bitcoin - Because nobody knows what the "official" response is going to be, few people want to jump in and offer a service tied to their real identity - This means the only people left a) Aren't concerned, b) are lying.   People take time to learn, but once they do we'll have a very reputation based user-base on our hands, and woe unto you who tries get someone to work with you on faith.
Everything happens for a reason.

he said tie it to a reputation system, not tie it to your social-security-having-legally-binding government name.   Pick a psuedonym and create your reputation with your actions.

Yes, privacy is important - Any attempt around that is "lame'
