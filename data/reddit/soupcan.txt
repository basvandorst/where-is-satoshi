Bought my first bit of coin at $80 on the run up to $250 that April. Would have bought sometime in 2009-2010 if I could've been arsed to set up PayPal.

I've seen just as many warnings telling users to always check the commands they're given and to never just copy-paste. Once again, it comes down to how much the user knows &amp; how security-minded they are.

So how do I delete my account?

I bought at $255. I'm going to buy again as soon as my next paycheck is in. I'll buy tonight or tomorrow if it falls low enough. People said over and over not to put in more than you can afford to lose, and I didn't. I'm definitely not happy about the crash, but I'm not done yet.

Now I can finally get my $1.39 back! Huzzah!

I was under the impression that they had removed the 30 limit on new users due to the Dwolla/MTGox thing.

Bitfloor is my preferred alternative, simply because I can get money into faster than any other exchange I know of.

Yah, a Black Lotus is actually worth money. So are a few other cards from Alpha.

Because people like getting a small amount of BTC every day rather than waiting for once a week. Instant gratification.

I was joking :D

I avoid satoshidice for two reasons: the microtransactions bloat up the blockchain, and I have no idea how to actually *play* satoshidice.

I'm a big fan. I've only used their cash deposit system, but each time the money has showed up on the site before I can complete the 5 minute drive home. I can't speak to their other methods of getting USD in, but so far I'm very pleased with bitfloor.

I've only sent them money via cash deposit, I can't speak to the efficacy of their other payment methods. Every deposit I've made has been credited to my account before I can even make it home.

I don't understand why you feel it's wrong for me to want a non-GUI bitcoin wallet, especially considering there currently isn't one. And why are other people's wants/needs more important than mine? Ultimately the choice rests with the developers, I was simply stating my opinion.

Now THAT is one of the most absurd things I've ever heard. "Lol sorry guys you can't cancel your order if you no longer want our product due to our incompetence."

At the moment, ripple is not nearly robust &amp; secure enough to act as an exchange.
EDIT: Maybe spoke too soon. More research is needed.

I just used it today without any trouble at all. The money showed up on bitfloor before I even got home.

If I had followed through with my plan to buy a few hundred and sit on them two years ago, I'd have the equivalent of ~20k USD right now. I didn't, and now I have a grand total of 1BTC sitting in my wallet. I'm really hoping for a crash soon because I just want to get more coins at a reasonable price.
@_date: 2013-10-19 02:57:46
Well, I definitely need a new exchange since I don't anticipate using CampBX anymore.

I hope it stays ncurses/terminal. I don't want or need a wallet with a GUI.
