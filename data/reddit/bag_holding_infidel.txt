That looks like a sorting address that most BFX transactions go to before being moved to your personal address. It would be difficult to find the correct output that corresponds to yours as it would probably be bundled with other transactions.

There are different types of security depending on the implementation. We are going around in circles here.
We were discussing Bitcoin and I specifically said that an implementation using mostly PoS will probably be the best solution. But you cannot remove the PoW completely without implementing a trusted party which is a point of failure.

I doubt it was on CMC within the first 2 days of the launch. Every fork spiked to ridiculus numbers the first day or 2 of launch since anyone in the world could buy but only those with coins on the exchanges could sell. They were technically futures since it would be months until the coins actually existed. Some never even existed. I sold Bitcoin File and Bitcoin God for 4% each and they never launched. I sold some BCG for 0.2BTC on HitBTC the day of the launch. People didn't know what they were buying.

Every exchange will be doing this soon. You have to identify the source and destination of all your transactions. Otherwise Bitstamp is facilitating crime. Sending coins to a mixer is an absolute no.

What they did wasn't tecnically fair. Other exchanges that got hacked paid back the BTC.
But the hack was 1% of all BTC and they were insolvent.
They would still be paying it off to this day if it was denominated in BTC.
The only way they could survive is to ask their customers to bail them out and denominate the debt in USD (as what would happen legally).

The US gov has banned companies from doing business with US citizens.

After the genesys block there was one whale. Then two. Then ten. Over time, BTC got distributed further and further into the ecosystem. The effect of individual whales gets smaller over time.
BTC's killer app is its *potential* store of value properties. It will be volatile until it passes the time test to be and *actual* store of value. It will be 100x its current cap when it gets there.
Your friend is being conservative and looking for an actual store of value to make small gains and missing out on 100x potential returns due to the higher risk of getting now.

Of course its not. Its digital USD. I would argue thats its not even a coin, its a token representing an IOU from a government.
Its not an attempt to compete with Bitcoin but it can act as an on-ramp to BTC and it educates the public about digital assets, all of which complement bitcoin.
People who use the word shit-coin in this manner are not using it correctly.
BCH is a shit-coin. Digital fiat is not. And most shit-coins will be well gone before digital fiat is commonplace.

What makes you think that? I often visit r/btc and haven't noticed any difference. The same fundamentalisis are still hanging around talking to themselves.


Dude, what the hell are you talking about? I did 10 times worse? What has this got to do with me and what makes you think you know anything about me? Have you confused me with a BCH supporter? That attitude isn't helpful.


Again, WTF are you talking about?
My entire point was that 90% of the BCH community is toxic and keeping them in one place is a good idea. Part of that process involves the necessity to limit blocksize debates on r/bitcoin since BCHers love to troll us. To be honest, you sound just as toxic as any BCH supporter I have encountered.

r/btc is a discussion forum to debate increasing the block size. That kind of discussion is not normally permitted on r/bitcoin for a number of valid reasons. Very little censorship exists around any other topic other than the blocksize. r/btc was set up for this reason and it acts as a vent to keep the blocksize conversations away from Taking over r/btc would be a very bad idea because there is still an active community there who fully believe their version is the real bitcoin and they aren't gonna disappear.

I don't think BFX care if you pay your tax. And if you are not verified, you would not be able to withdraw fiat through them so you are probably not tax liable from their transactions at that time.

You are mixing up whether something is against the law and whether something is unregulated. Gox money was lost cause it was unregulated. That doesn't mean the owners can steal your coins. They still belong to you.


That was an unfortunate event a result of a hack, not due to them choosing for it to happen. And we had the option to sell our BFX, it wasn't forced on us. I chose to buy more. The liquidation price was $604. The tokens were at par by April when they were converted to shares and are now worth 40x.

I think Tether.io is used by market makers who keep the usd/usdt currency pair in line with other exchanges.
They are big entities with tens of millions on their books with special access to banking in countries with less restrictions like Taiwan.

Get verified on BFX and explain the situation to them. They might allow you to transfer the USDT for $20, which is the Omni transaction fee.

If you are being brigaded at this stage, I would suggest that maybe you are not communicating in a diplomatic and respectful manner.
I often get into quite deep conversations on r/btc and if you word it correctly and are respectful, you quickly get rid of the shillers and downvoters and find people who genuinly want to learn but have been badly mislead by their narrative.

They continuously bash on any 2nd layer developments and ignore the "Security" component of the fee cost when comparing fees.
They call SegWit a disaster without backing it up with reasons and think there is a massive conspiracy out there by Axa to take over development and we are all paid shills.
Some of them actually believe that BCH value will absolutly overtake that of BTC in the near future when everyone else realises whats going on.
They rely on a single sentence in the white paper "peer to peer cash" to support their full argument and ignore that in is not decentralised in any way.

I disagree. For it to be a good medium of exchange, you need to be exchanging something that is a good SoV. SoV comes first, then MoE.
When BTC established itself as digital gold, layer 2 solutions will enable the cash part, thereby living true to the white paper (not that the white paper is entirely relevany anymore, Bitcoin is us and we need to design it to best suit the needs of the world)

Seems to be a bit of confusion about this. JPM coin isn't a coin. Its a token which will allow their assets under their portfolio to be traded against other institutional assets managed by other institutions such as J-Coin (representing $1.8 trillion) to be launched next month. Oracles will act as clearing houses. This will disintermediate current clearing houses and make trading shares cheaper and quicker. You will also be able to buy a portion of a share as a result.
Those who dismiss this implementation by comparing it to Bitcoin and saying its not decentralised are missing the point that blockchains like these will manage assets of far greater value than BTC and will boost Bitcoin in the process.
This tech will bring education of different crypto asset classes to the masses and increase demand for BTC.

I wouldn't trust a large amount of BTC in a channel TBH.
Also, the channel size would be visible on the blockchain, so while the transactions are private, the max transaction size is probably not.

Both banks and the bitcoin network are both systems that can be used for fraud.
Where there is money involved, there will be fraud. Neither are mutually exclusive.
Bankers will claim that BTC is used for fraud, BTC enthusiasts will claim banks are used for fraud.
Lets just acknowledge that everything involving money will be used for fraud.

Yeah. There are a potentially unlimited number of blockchain applications. China are the first to start the process of integrating their governmant departments with relevant applications and companies are following. The vast majourity of these applications will be permissioned but some will integrate with permissinless systems such as bitcoin. This whole process will evolve and the journey will expose people to the different types of blockchains that best suit their needs. Since we are on a bitcoin forum I will add the "this is good for bitcoin" since it educates people.
Part of the education process involves learning about the different types of blockchain implementations.
In fact, I would argue that you can't learn about bitcoin without getting a good understanding of how the bitcoin blockchain sits within the bigger picture.
@_date: 2019-12-11 19:50:21
I was joking. Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. Otherwise bitcoin would have no value.

You need to pass verification like everyone else that they block.

They have a different symbol for Liquid too (LBTC).
The Lightning network is still small. My guess is it is to balance load in the background until they are up and running with an automatic system.

I would have agreed with you on this a few years ago but we are way past that stage. Nearly every app or process you can think of will be moved to a blockchain within a decade. Just because its pseudo centralised (i.e. 100 oracles set up as clearance houses) doesn't decrease its utility for that particular application.


Yes, I agree. You have a point on this.

It will only get adopted if its beneficial. The long list of applications coming out of China is noteworthy.

Q. I didn't want to post this in the main forum
It would seem there is a narrative over on r/btc that there was considerable objection to SegWit even by small blockers and that it was forced through. 
Thats not how I remember it. I asked about it and was accused of trolling.
Why would small blockers object to SegWit or is it nonsense?

There was talk in the US to exclude purchases under $600 from CGT but it hasn't progressed yet but eventually if crypto becomes a widespread payment system, vendors will use a payment provider like what BitPay is today.

Another issue with his second point is that he claims dominance is trending towards zero without looking at the reasons for the fall in dominance. One of the reasons is the explosion of alts, most of which only have value because people haven't figured out bitcoins value proposition. As the world figures this out these alts will die and bitcoin dominance will rise again, not continue to fall.

It needs a big market cap to be stable and support the whole planet. It'll get there by being the SoV coin. The ticker BTC being used by hedge funds and an etf will speed this along. Brand name is important too.


When you say "Should", We are bound by technology. It will get there but we need to give it time. Trying to get there too quickly by onchain scaling weakens the whole system.

Well one scenario is scientifically correct.
When it comes to BTC and BCH, the difference is of ideology.
From experience, both sides use inflamitary language and accuse each side of things that aren't true and create unnecessary division. I don't consider either side an attack. They are both trying to guide what they consider theirs in the direction that they think is best. Personally I think the split is the best thing that has happened to BTC cause it shed the "On Chain" gang and allowed us to continue with L2 tech.
@_date: 2019-01-23 16:22:20
Very good piece. They normally bash crypto but that is more realistic.
BTC will be a PoW and PoS combo at some stage anyway.

Its a scam to omit the words "as a store of value" from the first sentence. Newbs don't know the nuanced differences between the two different ideologies and until BCH goes to zero, the store of value component needs to be defined.

@_date: 2017-09-05 15:15:26


Not true. USDT is linked to the USD. It allows any crypto to trade against USD for price discovery. Without it, the other cryptos would only be traded against BTC. This means that Polo can exist without access to banking, which is why it is so successful.

I was around. I use BTC every day. I payed $30 one day to be included in the next block. BTC has always worked perfectly for me but thats because I can afford to pay whatever fee is required.

In time as we build new tech, it becomes more affordable to more people until eventually everyone can use it as a currency as well as a SoV.

Its our money. And we have consensus on what direction to bring it.

@_date: 2017-10-02 17:14:58


Correct. Some will leave if they have a certain philosophy, some will recognise that 2x has consensus and continue their passion helping the community like they always did. The cat is out of the bag now that BTC exists and the world is full of great programmers waiting to write great code. Maybe some current devs should take a break for a while.

They have private investors. AtlasRand knows this and persists on spending his time lying throughout Reddit.

Its heavily biased to the point of it being unreadable.
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:00:17
Because it turns out AtlasRand is lying and the exchanges don't consult him prior to doing their due diligence.
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:41:07
I doubt they will ever release info related to tethers. The audit will include everything else. Tethers are issued by iFinex, which is a different company. Also, I would presume the business arrangement with their investors would be confidential.
The worries that are expressed on Reddit are none of their concern. Their responsibilities are to the stakeholders. Those who want to use USDT can, those who don't are free not to.
BFX have spent too much time addressing liars and deliberate FUDsters in here. There are 2 that still spend considerable time making up stuff and publishing lies. BFX's time is better spent addressing other customers needs.
@_date: 2017-10-02 16:18:52


Agreed. Like I said, hopefully there will be no stories of loss.


Unfortunately that is not a possibility. Hopefully core will agree to upgrade to 2x.


It wouldn't surprise me that if there was evidence of loss, that the receivers would agree to reverse the transaction after the process is complete. The whole bitcoin ecosystem (apart from dark markets) seems quite altruistic.
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:48:58


If they got caught, their business would be gone. They would lose their jobs and let down their stake holders. BFX are as honest as it gets. These conversations are ridiculous.
I admire that they are not wasting resources here on Reddit acknowledging this nonsense. USDT is a very useful tool and I think its great that its use is expanding.

@_date: 2017-10-02 17:37:48
I have read that Eric V. has stated that if they don't have enough support to make a clean break, his preference is to abandon the project. He puts that number at above 80%. The higher it is, the cleaner it will be.

Go and sell then
@_date: 2017-09-05 11:06:07
Correct. An investor deposits $20m with them. There are lots of ways that the USD earns interest depending on how the USDT is used.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:01:09


That will not happen. Once the upgrade is complete, everyone will be free to propose code changes again.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:27:08


That innovation works just as well on 2x.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:52:46


If only everyone was like you and there were no coins on any exchanges. We could all just guess what the spot price was and everyone use Local Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-11 10:30:54
The number of customers they can have is limited by the blocksize
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:43:24
Then the old chain would still exist. There is far less confusion if it is just left to die off.
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:10:46


I don't have a belief. I am indifferent to which chain wins. My guess is that the 2x is the better option but if we continue with 1x, thats fine because thats what consensus has brought us.


Thats not what I meant and you know it, you are changing the argument. Us, as owners of BTC, own our BTC.


For segwit 2x to hold the BTC ticker on all exchanges and avoid confusion, it absolutely needs to ensure the old chain is wiped out as quick as possible. Being an alt defeats the purpose.


To my knowledge, you cannot change the destination address of a transaction by rebroadcasting it. I'm open to be corrected on this.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:16:40
Of course its a different scenario but the exchanges will still stop taking deposits.
The problem you describe won't happen if the old chain has died off, which is why I said you should wait until it has.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:31:13
I presume he is talking about Bitcoin Cash. What are you referring to that is to be launched in 2018?
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:41:43
Well instead of discussing users, maybe exchanges shed more light. All the exchanges where the users trade and hence, where the money is, support the upgrade. Bitfinex has the highest USD/BTC volume and they want the upgrade. I don't think the no of users in opposition on Reddit are enough to make the required difference.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:56:11
Are you suggesting that traders are beginners?

That could never happen. The ecosystem is too broad with conflicting interests. Bitcoin needs to progress and can't be held hostage by those who prefer the status quo.
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:50:15


Nope. They are too busy and are crushing it, so much so that they cannot find good support staff to meet their popularity. There are very few exchanges in that space and they know they will continue to fill that niche.
@_date: 2017-10-10 23:06:52


This is base camp
@_date: 2019-09-20 21:06:39
That doesn't work. The US has laws that prevent those exchanges serving US customers and AMLD5 does the same in Europe from 2020.
Look at the hassle Bitfinex gets from NY for allowing US customers on their platform even though the customers claim they are not from the US.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:09:40

@_date: 2017-10-02 15:50:17


We reached an impasse. There was no other option


I was referring to the unresolved blocksize issue. It has been proven an impossible task to upgrade the network.


Correct. Hopefully there will be no stories of loss.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:35:58


Apologies if it appeared I was saying they were alike. 
When i said "like when the BCH fork happened" I was referring to the practice of exchanges of stopping deposits during the time of a fork, like when they stopped when the BCH fork happened.


You are correct. This is why people need to be aware of it and it needs to be quick. 


It is unfortunate that we have found ourselves in this position but it is necessary to get through the impasse and worth it in the end.
@_date: 2017-10-10 20:22:24
Correct. If all goes to plan, it will be seamless.
@_date: 2017-10-02 15:57:47


Thats probably an impossible task to do completely


With replay protection, it is no longer BTC and thus there is no point. It is then no different to BCH.


See above
@_date: 2017-10-02 17:30:30


If the upgrade is successful, there will not be another block found on the 1x chain, so the rebroadcasted transaction will never be settled on chain.

Thanks for breaking it to me, don't worry about it. So are you saying that if 95% of the miners start mining a different chain and attacks the original chain, that there is a 100% chance that it will not die out? Are you basing this on the fact that is has been running ok for 8 years and has not suffered such an attack yet?

@_date: 2017-10-10 21:28:33
Thanks for the detailed response.
I think its difficult to guage the percentage of users that are against it. Reddit is not a good guide as there are a lot of extreme views in here. The price of BT1 (which is what I was referring to, I mistyped S1X) on BFX would suggest that most think the fork will fail.
You mention that the 95% figure may be exaggerated. That is my question. If it is true, the BT1 chain (as BFX calls it) may be wiped out.
What defines Bitcoin or which companies support it no longer matter if it doesn't exist.
I suspect if mining support for B2X drops under 80%, BT1 may have a chance but I have read that if support drops this low, they will abandon the upgrade because they consider it too dangerous. In which case, BT2 will go to zero.
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:32:49

Traders need centralized exchanges for high frequency trades and access to banks. USDT is for traders to arb between exchanges without going through the banks.

Excellent summary.
I see Circle offering an exchange rate for BTC/USD, BTC/EUR &amp; BTC/STG. This will allow people to convert between currencies without cost while Circle set their rates to front run demand. BTC market cap will grow taking part of this market share from the banks.

Are you mixing up leverage with rehypothecation?
Using leverage just means that the trader gets liquidated on lower price movements. It does nothing to the supply.

You do realise that he is referring to a time in the near future when the BTC distribution phase is more than 75% complete and inflation is down to that what you might normally see in first world fiat or gold. Years after, it is possible that folks will automatically convert their fiat balance to BTC and back again as required to hedge against inflation.

You are mixing me up with op.

An income?
Traders long and short. Thats how they earn a living.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:46:26
I suspect you are not telling the full story here.
I went through the same process. It took 9 weeks and was very painful. They now know everything about me but I got there in the end.
Your problem is most likely with the source of your deposits. You need to do your best to trace every deposit back to a recognised source. If you can't or are unwilling, your money is gone.
I suspect HitBTC are being forced to go through this process. Ultimately, no exchange will be able to accept 'Black' coins. I suspect we will see it this year.
And before all you morons jump in and say "Well its his money, he shouldn't have too", thats irrelevant, this is the way it is, you need to play ball or lose your BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:44:47
Everything you say is correct. But they are not doing it by choice. Why would they? They are being forced. I lost a fortune due to their incompetence and they lost me as a customer. But the fact of the matter is, you have to play by their rules to get your money out, otherwise you are not getting it.

I use Purse for Amazon.co.uk and Amazon.com. I have found that max discount I can get in the UK is ~13% while the US is still higher. I assumed that in the UK there is no mechanical Turk market so the demand is lower. Purse also recently jacked up their fees which doesn't help either.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:09:30
You are mixing up shorting with selling to cash out. The spot price is set by traders going either long or short. Shorting is unrelated to BTC's utility. 
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:53:20
I meant why.

It does. You need inflation to decrease the value of your debt over time and make it easier to repay, not more difficult as would be the case with BTC since it is likely to continue to increase in value.


This will be a fiat denominated debt backed by BTC collateral
