Will Bitcoin save us common people? Thoughts?
Just want to add that I don't agree with him on any topic, but I find this talk interesting.

Still waiting for the end of Chinese New Year, I’ve heard everyone will buy back

Germany has negative interest rates meaning that you pay money to keep them in the bank. It's a great news, just wandering if they are going to do the same with Bitcoin. If not and it really happens this will be huge
@_date: 2019-03-19 12:54:08
It's amazing how we always want to buy cheaper, in those comments people regretting not buying when it was 20$ when it was only 200$, maybe one day we will regret not buying more at 4000$ who knows

USDT dominance at it's highest level in history, this means lot of money parked sideways waiting to get back in. At the moment it's way overbought and showing some bearish divergences, same with Bitcoin all the way around. Our beloved crypto it's way oversold and showing some bullish divergences. 
Last year we started to drop from 6k mid November and we reached the bottom mid December. 
My opinion is that this might be the bottom, or at least a short term bottom. Some people starting panicking , others selling in the hope to buy more at lower prices. Shorters are increasing since we broke some key moving averages. We might see a short squeeze.
Personally I'm still buying and accumulating, next year thanks to the halving our inflation will be around 2%  in line with most developed countries. What I'm waiting for it's an inflation rate of 1% or lower, then we will be beating even gold inflation.

Disbelief phase, everyone has seen that chart in the past thinking that they would have never fallen from it. And yet they have, hell I have doubt myself. Market psychology it's real.

I just want to add that if I was a big player with maybe 5mill waiting to invest in Bitcoin, maybe I would spend some money spreading fud  misinformation and dumping the market to scare the shit out of retail buyers and buy at cheaper prices. If we where to go up until the halvening how easy would have been? Instead we are all here worried and doubting ourselves thinking to make a "smart move" that will serve their purpose. This is a wild theory, I guess we will see in few months
@_date: 2019-11-27 07:04:21
This article is garbage, it's all theoretical nothing coming on the market for the next few years...yet they make it sound like it
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:29:35
What? Did futures stop Bitcoin to pump 30% in few hours last time? I don't believe in those stories
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:21:42
Wait for Chinese New year
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:02:16
How can you invest your investment if you have already invested? Instead try to concentrate and ask your future self what's the price of Bitcoin at that time so you know what's better, wait for lower price of buy now. Please let me know what he says
@_date: 2019-11-25 05:06:17
Keep strong my friend
@_date: 2019-11-22 21:26:34
Last time we reached that level we pumped 30% in few hours. I don't know, but to me means that people are selling not to get out of cryptos but to buy at cheaper prices. Money are there, they are only waiting.

People here starting to call prices under 1k, when we go up they call for 1million. I would say we need the reddit indicator on the charts, when everyone believes we are going for the impossible just do the opposite
@_date: 2019-11-22 13:09:57
Did you ask your future self to look at the charts,maybe two years from now? Please let me know what's the price I want to sell now and buy more later as well. Thanks

On a seriouse note, apart my advice of watching on YouTube some psychedelic videos, there is something that many people don't look at, and that's USDT market domination. At the moment it's at the same level as when Bitcoin was at 3k. Maybe write down your ideas and read them tomorrow, don't go on your exchange now. Mind can think very differently and you could not see it until the effect are vanished. What I can say it's that it's good stuff, enjoy!

Yes it's been a while but they started to charge their customers only few months ago, before it was only accounts holding more than 100k, now apparently they are charging everyone no matter how much you have. Stealing in plain sight, plus quantitative easing and inflation they are screwing Europeans big time.

Too many people predicting 6k, so yes maybe. Long term my feeling is that we are going up, in Europe they have already negative interest rates and in some countries in the eurozone banks are already making their clients paying for it. You have more than 100k in your bank account? Here you have a nice negative interest of 0.5%, paying for holding your worthless fiat in your bank account. How does it feels? Watch negative interests spreading to other countries outside the EU zone next year. It will be interesting. Plus for now btc has still have the best run in 2019 compared to the stock market, if it keep this levels it will make news by the end of the year as the best investment of 2019, plus halving first quarter of 2020. Not sure who is selling now and why.
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:10:56
Because of ASIC manufacturers, look at bitmain they have 40% of the pools. They use them for themselves plus antminers come preconfigured with antpool, any antminer so that pool it's not only for BTC.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:21:03
You think you are not using, like gold sitting in a vault, are you using it? Yes, edging against inflation and monetary policies. Nothing wrong in selling, it all depends on how long you want to stay in the market. For short term gains this doesn't look like the right moment..For the long run who knows. My plan is to keep it for 5 to 10 years.
@_date: 2019-10-18 10:58:59
Sell when everyone wants to get in, but when everyone thiks it's going nowere. I've stopped talking about cryptos whith everyone some months ago, it's better.

Just received a raspberry pi for Christmas, I'm going to build one soon. The cool thing about Bitcoin it's that everyone can participate to it's development and everyone can help make it stronger. It's nice to hold Bitcoin, but doing something for it at the same time feels much better.
@_date: 2019-12-28 01:21:23
How do you think we got to today's prices from 0$? People developing, mining, running nodes basically for free. If everyone holding Bitcoin was going to do something constructive for it the price would be somewhere else.

Probably true, but this doesn’t mean that is the right time to buy, probably there are a lot of whales shorting, maybe some shorted from 20k all the way down. They only want to make sure they can get the most out of it. But this doesn’t mean we are at the bottom or that they want to accumulate fooling everyone else.
