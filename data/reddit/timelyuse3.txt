So what solution are you suggesting then?  You will always have to remember something.  You will always have to have a memory in your head either about your setup or your passphrase that keeps your Bitcoins secure.  If people can't manage that then they will have to rely on centralized systems which do it for them and which they have to trust.

Bitcoin is unforgiving, if he doesn't have enough technical expertise to restore his coins by himself, he doesn't deserve them.  His loss of BTC just makes all of ours more valuable.

Is there a way people with an interest in the health of the network could stake money on LN which would be rewarded to miners who mine blocks with a maximized number of transactions in them to clean this up?

It does have that vibe and it's a shame, how do we change that perception and have open public conversations about topics?  I've been thinking it for a while, that it's really bad for our society that we don't have real life discussion places like for instance reddit, but in real life.

What are you trying to say?  That Bitcoin is controlled by a few nerds working for a global conglomerate?  If this were true, how does it mean they control the economy?

He's obviously really smart, but he's not a super-genius just based on what he's done.  Facebook was just a shitty spaghetti code PHP website at first that ended up being the right product for the time period.

I disagree, this is a really good photo and it looks like an album cover.  I'm saving it.

Stable infrastructure exists in the background, it's something you forget about and rest easy knowing it exists and it will get the job done.  How will you feel when Bitcoin has achieved its purpose?  You'll be rich, yeah, but you should not get used to treating Bitcoin as some form of excitement.  We want Bitcoin to become boring like toilets and refrigerators.  We want it to just be there, ubiquitous and reliable.  Because that is when it has succeeded.

If BTC represents freedom why is it biased in favor of those who were born during this time period who had technological knowledge?

A service for storing my wallet seed on the blockchain with heavy encryption applied.  Basically a permanent-through-the-blockchain key-value store of username-&gt;binaryBlob where anyone can download the binaryBlob since it's on the blockchain but only I can decrypt it with my password
This would really help solve the issue of storing tons of encrypted backups everywhere since it's guaranteed to last as long as Bitcoin does.  If Bitcoin dies my wallet is useless, so it doesn't matter if I lose it.  If it's alive my wallet is there for my safety.  It's a perfect system.

It's not about math being used, it's about who is trusted.  Who is doing the math for fiat currencies?  Humans we have to trust.  Who is doing the math for cryptocurrencies?  Computers which we don't have to trust due to Nakamoto Consensus, which works because of math, which we also don't have to trust because it can be proven.

It's pretty obvious how this relates to Bitcoin.  If you didn't understand his points you should probably go study.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:29:07
If it's sufficiently encrypted then the data is as good as random bits to them and they can never, for the life of the universe, decrypt them.  If you don't believe in this then you also don't believe in the math that underlies Bitcoin's cryptography.  That means that if you trust Bitcoin's security you must also trust the most common secure encryption algorithms in use today, or else you're wrong about the math.  I hope that explains it to you.

No point explaining how it works, only what it does
It's a magic bag anyone can transport money into by speaking its name, but only you can take money out of with its secret password.  The money also can't be replicated or faked

You're probably right, I'm being too anxious because I know the obscure way my paper-written key was hidden so I assume the robbers can know it
But you need redundancy.  You need it in multiple places.  What if you forget which random book it's in or someone robs your house and steals the book then you lose your copy?  You need other copies.  The more redundancy you implement with your seed being written down, the higher the chance of someone accidentally finding it.  With encrypted backups that's not the case though.  You can have dozens of backups of your encrypted container everywhere and you just need one, and making tons of copies does not decrease security at all

Most people don't even bother with basic financial competence, don't expect them to buy into the cutting edge
Forget it OP.  Buy them Bitcoin if you want to, that's what I'm doing.  Either Bitcoin dies and they forget about it in 10 years, or it succeeds and I'm the hero who gives them their $10k check for the small gifts I purchased them in the past

You don't need a single-purpose disk partition you can use an encrypted file container which you can copy anywhere and even store on the cloud

This.  I will be purchasing some BTC in my IRA even despite the "not your keys not your Bitcoin" reality because of the tax benefits.
@_date: 2019-04-13 19:54:59
So you just exposed a portion of the wallet seed?  Do you know that it doesn't just decrease the wallet's security by 5%, it decreases it exponentially.  Every bit you expose cuts the security in half
Nice fucking job please learn about this technology.  I suggest you move the bitcoin to a new wallet

Yeah, make sure they're not so small that your tax accounting becomes complex and you gave overhead costs in fees.  For instance transfer money into an exchange in batches and make fee-free limit buys if they offer it, every once in a while.  I suggest buying once a month.
@_date: 2019-05-25 05:47:24
No, if you're investing then you're supposed to constantly buy a steady stream of small amounts of Bitcoin.  If you're a trader go ahead and time the market, but you said investing.

Enron was not a fundamentally new type of asset and has absolutely nothing in common with Bitcoin.  Enron was a company whose stock unhooked from the internal realities of the company due to corruption and false reporting.  There is nothing analogous to say about Bitcoin.  This is a complete mischaracterization.
