You are saying you've successfully processed hundreds of thousands of transfers from coin exchanges through your LLC with no problems from your bank?
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:45:04
It's not straw-man I can only tell you from what I know speaking with people in the industry having this exact issue.
I would imagine the large companies have an easier time getting approval than large miners due since its a much more abstract idea/process than a company like Bitpay for example.

Some dude just got busted for trading other people's money and not complying with all of the anti-terrorism and anti-money laundering regulations that are out there. Unless you know what you are doing in this area, I would just make the bot downloadable and teach them how to add it to their own account. That's honestly your only way to go about this DO NOT take their money and invest it for them.

Perhaps our definitions of large amounts differ. Believe me the large mines in the US are having a very hard time finding banks that want to process hundreds of thousands of USD regularly from "unknown" crypto sources. It's an absolute nightmare from a anti-terrorism/anti-money laundering regulation point of view.
It's certainly anything but simple as you naively put it.

Moving millions of USD through normal bank channels is far different than processing large amounts regularly from a crypto mining operation where coins seemingly appear out of thin air into your account. It's a much more abstract concept for the bank to grasp. Even a crypto hedge fund is far easier to get approval due to the fact you can provide trading statements that show how you got to that amount of coin. For mining ops though, and to anyone on the outside, money just *poofs* into your account - and for a bank dealing with AML regulations and gaining very little from dealing with you, most just say no.
And no I'm not just making this up and I already said where I'm basing this from. It's obviously hearsay though so no point in going down that path.

If only it was that simple...

old news? wtf are you smoking

Only like .001% can't sell, so your narrative doesn't hold up.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:00:22
didnt work for me
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:26:59
Wait, how many people do you think can cash out millions and never work again?
Most of us barely hold any coin lmao. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:05:44
Dont be ignorant. This is something that happened today. That's like saying oh because a bank has been robbed once in the past, any time a bank gets robbed in the future its old news. WTF no its not, its fucking current it happened today. God you are dense
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:23:56
They aren't refusing.  A lot of people's verifications are taking weeks right now.

Backlog.  Exactly. Not stolen, but backlog. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:51:53
Just because you haven't heard of something doesn't mean no one has.  Nice hash is actually pretty well known in the community. Which just goes to show how ignorant you are...
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:28:27
It is if that granny was scammed out of $60M lol -- why are you being so knowingly obstinate? You can try and pretend like this isn't big news or its old news but you are blind if you think that... Is this going to crash bitcoin? Abso-fuckin-lutely NOT....  Is it news? 100% yes
@_date: 2015-12-20 20:51:39
Let's get this to the top. I'd love to see a response from OP
@_date: 2014-02-09 06:21:13
Who verifies whether the events occurred or did not occur? Surely some of them will come down to technicalities and judgement calls. Really cool idea though...
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:30:41
Once Gox finally dies all the people will fill up the other exchanges raising those prices. Gox has been a fake number for a while now and r/bitcoin talks about it all the time. 
Crashes are nothing new. If anything they just bring in a huge surge of new buyers raising the prices to higher than ever afterwards. Look at 2013 and see what happened to the market after the big crashes.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:39:44
Btc-e is a scam?? Market makers and whales play the market just like on any other exchange ever. You are mad because rich people and companies can buy and sell lots of bitcoin? Why take it out on btc-e?
 Playing the market is always a risk, you didn't get robbed you simply were unlucky or stupid.

Here is a screen-shot of what it says... 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:46:43
No you don't understand the convention.  As said elsewhere here, it's common in many other areas and is being applied to bitcoin here.  The 21 million club is for people who own at least 1 bitcoin because only 21 million people technically could ever own 1 bitcoin. It's not a new thing,  it's just something you apparently don't know about.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:36:22
No you just clearly don't understand what he's referring to. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:43:26
Another play to promote BCH and bring down the price of bitcoin so that the big dogs can make a lot with the manipulation.  We see the price of BCH spiking again and they are trying the same thing again. So btc will probably dip for a few days and then bounce back like it always does.

Do you have any idea the price of gold based purely on intrinsic use rather than a store of value?  It was be super cheap. We even have gold plated electronics with the current price of gold, imagine if nobody was hoarding it 
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:58:04
ideals and culture? Wtf get out of here with that bullshit. That has nothing to do with this discussion. This is about electronic security and best practices with virtual currencies on the internet. If you make yourself a target, you will be targeted. That's all he's saying.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:54:10
He's being downvoted but he's actually right -- gold has some intrinsic value, but virtually nothing compared to its current price. That's why we have gold plated HDMI cables EVEN at today's current gold prices. If it had no store of wealth value, gold would be alongside other minerals of its rarity (very cheap).

What better way to show that your disagree with something than to give it a bad score?

Lol easy there buddy. South Korea did ban raising money though ICO's in Korea so don't act like it's not news...
@_date: 2017-09-21 21:18:12
Lol are you surprised you got a single downvote?  Welcome to Reddit.  
If someone agrees with you, they upvote. If they disagree, they downvote.  Are you really that surprised that someone might disagree with your analysis? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:44:21
Ugh. Pathetic!
@_date: 2017-10-03 06:27:16
Most altcoins are bought on exchanges with bitcoin. So if bitcoin goes up in price, the altcoin has to go down in price the same % in order to remain equal USD value. So if bitcoin goes up 10% and the altoin remains at 0% change, then the altcoin technically gained 10% USD value. Make sense?

Whales just doing whale things? Or an associated news?
