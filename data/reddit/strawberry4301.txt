Only Canadians can't tell the difference between society (all of us) and government (that guy that comes by and takes your money, more often than he comes by and puts out a fire)

Those are rare. The nearest one for my bank is a 20 minute drive out to some country village.

Not even a Chase customer but I am doing this. Once average people see how 'terrorism' laws hurt them, we might get a decent protest going on the National Mall.

Not OP, but it looks like it's cash only. Checks are okay. Much like all other anti-money laundering bullshit laws.

You can't withdraw more than X amount from a bank? It's _your_ money, why aren't people upset?

I carry $300 USD in cash to pay people for small things like meals.
Of course, everyone else my age carries just a driver's license and a credit card, and they think I am insane. But what would they do in cash-only stores without me?

I have $500 in paper checks from that sort of refund thing. Luckily I can drive a mile and put them in an ATM. (I'm in the US)

They can't be open to EVERYONE by law, so they all have a restricted 'field of membership' - mine allows anyone who lives in the county, or is a member of "Save The Whales" or some shit, to join. Membership in "Save the Whales" is $10 and they only check once.

Why do chinks love cash?

Backing you up- I just paid the electric company by logging in to nameOfElectricCompany.com and giving them my credit card number, then they took money from it as if I had swiped my credit card in a store. that's the standard 'online purchase' that i would use at Amazon. (America) I could have also done ACH but I like the 1% cash back on my credit card.
@_date: 2014-02-03 05:42:19
I just looked that up and it seems to just be a way to pay for things with a debit/credit card in a store? Yeah, we have that of course. We even have the cash-out thing where you can withdraw money from your account at the same time you buy something. Is there something special about Eftpos? Or is it just buying things with a card?

With amplifiers and directional antennas, you can often reach your neighbors. And it's probably better to connect to a small number of neighbors who you trust, than the random idiots in my apartment complex.

even the US has Medicare/Medicaid and the National Firearms Act and Gun Control Act of 1968.

In the USA when I tell my electric company my bank's ID, and my account number, and I click a checkbox, they can withdraw my money.
What additional information is required to withdraw? In the US the information is the same for withdrawals and deposits.

Ah, I guess I've never used that search thing. I use locate or find on the command line, so I guess I'm okay for now.

Please write a letter to the President about this job destruction. Seriously, he read an Obamacare-related letter during the State of the Union.

Even in the US, that is what i have used it for mostly.
Sometimes, if your landlord is some random guy, he will want checks. But if you live in a large apartment building, EVERYTHING can be paid online. If I paid my rent by check there would be a $10 fee.
@_date: 2014-02-03 06:52:24
Ah, yeah, we have that. We just refer to it as 'buying things with a debit card' I guess...there may be an official name too. No fees, money comes right out of your checking account. Swipe your card and type in a 4-6 digit PIN.

Over 99% of my money is in banks or stocks, and I would have done the same. I'd rather keep cash under my mattress than deal with that nonsense.
