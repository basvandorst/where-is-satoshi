It really is hard to predict the market. There might be a few people who have enough knowledge and experience in cryptocurrencies, economy, psychology etc. to make a good prognosis. But the vast majority does not have much more to offer than a rough future vision (such as "BTC will be $100,000 in a few years").
I think it is a good time to buy (I'll do so myself very soon). Maybe the price falls, maybe it goes up - who knows? I will buy because I believe in the potential and think the upper limit still is far away. And I rather lose some money in the short term than missing the chance to jump on the train early.
Or if you want to spread the risk you can buy small amounts over a prolonged time.

I don't see much future in Bitcoin anymore except for digital gold. BCH allows indeed for way cheaper transactions, but therefore it is also more centralized. Iota, which does not use a blockchain, solves both problems: fast and feeless transactions, but unlimited scaling without any miners. This could get really interesting.

I'm actually going all-in, since I currently do not depend on my savings (which I estimate rather low in comparison to my realistic future income). **I do not just recommend this to anyone, because of the obvious financial risks involved.**  I will invest like 80% into BTC as a store of value, 20% into XMR for speculation - buying in all at once, because of FOMO. I have to add that I already  invested a good bit recently.
I decided to do so for the simple reason that I will probably not need or use the money for at least three years and fiat money sitting in a bank account (where inflation is higher than interest rate) is no good store of value IMO. Even precious metals seem to have too many disadvantages over cryptos as well (transportation time, fraud risk, fees, potential theft, too much of it is in the hands of banks, gold has almost no real use cases, etc.). Furthermore I estimate that the likelyhood for BTC to double in value is &gt;90% (**ofcourse this is my own estimation, nobody should blindly follow such evaluations**). Therefore IMO it is rational to invest.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:39:51


Iota is using a DAG (directed acyclic graph) called "the tangle". Transactions confirm each other instead of being confirmed in blocks. There are no blocks, therefore no blockchain. Am I missing something?

I love the 2nd from the left.
Every one or two months I went to the bank counter and asked for my money to be transacted to a Bitcoin selling company. At first they were like 'whatever'. After the third time however, they started to recognize me and find it quite amusing to see me invest that much money into a 'digital toy'. Another day they asked me about how it's going, I told them how much it just raised in value, but they didn't believe it could stay this high for long.
The last time I went there, the woman at the counter welcomed me 'Ah, how much Bitcoins are you going to buy this time?'. And when she said 'Bitcoins' I noticed an important looking, fat businessman at the other end of the hall hectically standing up, rushing to the counter and asking me some noobish questions about Bitcoin, he was seemingly interested into this technology and told me I was making a really good investment. After he left, the woman asked me how much I thought one could make if one invested XXX amount of money now.

Why are you so sure about the price doubling just because of the halving? With every halving the inflation will go down by 50%, which theoretically raises the price only by a little. Halvings will become more and more meaningless with every time while mining will depend more and more on tx fees instead of the block reward.

It's only about 40 USD below current price (2200 EUR = 2500 USD) and does not directly influence the market price at the moment, because the whale will not buy anything as long as the price is higher than where he would buy in.

@_date: 2017-06-10 17:11:07
Well, you would have to open and close channels only a few times a year for unlimited LN use.
$330 fees per transaction? Only if BTC is worth one million and satoshis/byte stay the same. That's what happens without fork. Segwit would raise the number of transactions per block, LN would further diminish the amount of on-chain transactions, so fees would be way lower (of course there will come a time when a block size increase will be necessary).
@_date: 2017-06-30 17:50:17


How that?
@_date: 2017-06-10 20:39:59
Fees would be significantly lower and therefore the network would be secured by less hashpower. But I don't think we really need as much hashpower as we currently have to properly secure the network.

@_date: 2017-06-10 19:08:51


Bitcoin loses a lot of opportunity currently. There are so many coins which are superior in plenty of ways (fees, speed, anonymity, ...). I just hope that Bitcoins current popularity and mainstream adoption is enough to keep it one of the five most important coins.
Out of interest, what do you think about how to encounter the current scaling problem? Or is it too late for Bitcoin already?
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:11:19
In order to permanently cause reorgs, they would need at least the same hash power as the official BIP148 chain has (or slightly less, depending on their luck), this way they could create a secret chain which is longer than the official.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:53:02


Depends on how you want to fund the channel. If it is stored in a normal wallet, you would have to make an on-chain transaction to move your funds in the second layer. But what about exchanges using LN to send the funds directly through LN to you? Moreover, I think this method would be very much prefered by exchanges over on-chain because of speed and fees.


If there is demand, it will probably not take long for someone to develope LN software. We already have [pre-segwit attempts](
@_date: 2017-06-23 06:52:54
They can see on the blockchain which wallet received the coins and where they went from there and so on. Moving it to a third wallet in the mean time won't help much. Each transaction is publicly visible. The hard part is to find out who belongs to a given address.
If you want to make an anonymous transaction, you'll have to cut the connection somewhere inbetween your coinbank wallet and the receivers wallet. Best way to do that, is to use Bitcoin tumblers. If you worry about your privacy a lot and don't want to tumble every single time, you might be interested in Monero, which uses advanced cryptography to make payments practically untraceable.

I guess LN would need 1-3 months for developement (this is just my guess without any reference to back it up; could be a week or 2 years, depending on the success of any potential developer).
After this period you will have to wait until your transaction partners make use of LN, so you can open channels to them. Exchanges and big markets will probably be in rather early because of their huge amount of transactions, so this might only take another few weeks.
If SegWit activates, fees should be lower and on-chain transactions should be affordable for the meantime.

If you are looking for a long-term investment into BTC, you are hoping that it will reach 10k USD and more. So there should not be that much of a need to time the market.
Nobody knows how much BTC will be worth in a week. You can take the risk to wait and maybe get more BTC out of your money, but it could be less as well.
What some people like to do, is to make partial buys. Something like buying BTC for 100 USD every week.

Maximum of bitcoins that will ever exist: 21,000,000. This would mean a market cap of 21,000,000,000,000 USD (21 trillion USD).
*NOTE: Not all of them will be in circulation, not even close. But for the sake of simplicity, I will assume that they will.*
Let's further assume that we have 7,000,000,000 (7 billion) people, out of which (if BTC turns into a major global currency) maybe 1,000,000,000 (1 billion) use Bitcoin.
*NOTE: I just took this number out of nowhere. Who knows how likely this scenario is?*
In this case, the average BTC user would have 21,000 USD in BTC. Sounds much for an average, but if you consider how much money is in the hands of the most wealthy 1-5% of world population today, 1,000,000 USD / BTC is a pretty well imaginable number IMO.
