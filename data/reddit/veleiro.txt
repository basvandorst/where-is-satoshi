I havent paid attention to this subreddit in a long time not because of 's moderation, but because of the endless amount of most upvoted comments that all say something about censorship here, or Theymos's moderation.
Beating the dead horse much?

Have you seen what happened to the Popcorntime community? 
The MPAA cant stop open source software from forking, so instead they infiltrated the community.  They created so many forks of the projects, then in turn each would say the others are fake and owned by the MPAA to track pirates.  It left the community destroyed by not being able to trust any of the forks.  Look at these images

Remember Myriadcoin? It used 5 separate hashing functions (including sha256) where the difficulty is separate for each, and you'd need multiple types of hardware in order to achieve a 51% attack.  So if you used something like that, you wouldnt technically completely screw over the mining industry, just introduce new players to it.

@_date: 2017-08-08 01:32:14
Made spamming more effective, doubled initial blockchain time sync and amount of space required to store, double the bandwidth and latency between nodes.  Scaleable means its easy to increase capacity without any downsides. those are clearly downsides.
Bitcoin works as it is now.  Nodes don't crash when their mempool is full or spam attacks dont create traffic and desync issues. A network that relies on consensus would require those issues to never come up.
@_date: 2017-08-10 13:42:56
Also need to remember that Bitcoin is way ahead of any other crypto in terms of decentralization/antifragility.  Its battle-hardened from 8 years of endless attacks and attempts to undermine and control.  Any potential "better" cryptocurrency would either have to face the same battles in the same light, or be more centralized.  But it could never catch up to Bitcoin at this point.  That's why it makes no sense to support an alt alt and not support Bitcoin.

Stop trying to push or defend the 'invest in bitcoin for the money return it will one day provide you'
Stick with trustless uncensored money, thats a million times more valuable than any amout of profit from a censored, trust currency.  You will never convince them to invest in bitcoin because of how much its worth or will be worth. They'll just laugh at you.
@_date: 2015-08-20 02:26:15

Do you really think Mike and Gavin will give control and decision of the code back to the core developers *if* BitcoinXT does come out on top?  The entire community is arguing about the damn block size, meanwhile Mike inserts whatever he desires into this new fork and it is hardly glanced at or noted. BitcoinXT is much more than a "block size raise." When you vote BitcoinXT, you vote Mike and Gavin the only legit developers, and whoever/whatever they chose in the future.

How could I ever convince anyone to use a niche market with several barriers to entry (dollar -&gt; bitcoin exchange, custom software, bitcoin's fee market) and one one millionth+ the listings of ebays to start buying/selling their comic book collection on OpenBazaar instead of Ebay?  Why would someone want to use something so distanced from what theyre used to only in order to buy what they could easily buy on ebay?
This is why Openbazaar has no purpose in my mind.  I think you guys are misguided and/or you dont know the market that is demanded and had fueled the creation of a decentralized marketplace in the first place.  Drugs and contraband.  Markets that have been destroyed and censored everywhere else.  Dark Market knew this.  
To answer IamPezu's question, OpenBazaar doesnt give two fucks about anonimity

You seem to think that my arugment is related to money when in fact its related to freedom and anti-copyright and anti-oppression of a humans potential because of law that completely surrounds the art.  "If you view my art, you must pay the price and live in my world"
You can produce a piece of art without the law around it and still get compensated. Look at crowdfunding.

It means to use bitcoin's smart contracting features to establish terms between users that want to exchange value.  Those terms can be customized, and not just limited to one party having the private key to spend the funds.  Heres a large document on it from the bitcoin wiki.
@_date: 2015-09-29 17:08:33
Sorry that was a dumb reply from me, relating to bitcoin security.
I think sofar bitcoin has made great incentives for miners without compromising much of the freedom of everyone using the network.  But I disagree fully that raising the blocksize limit creates a more secure network.
@_date: 2015-04-20 19:02:27

Exchange that money, thats not the issue. The issue is asking for the surrendering of freedoms (in the form of abiding by unjust laws) it after the exchange is done.
Software is the one thing that can be infinitely reproduced with 0 resources, and can benefit everyone (yes, art benefits people as it can influence the way they see the world).  If you had a device that could produce an infinite amount of food with no cost to resources, there would be no hunger, no questions asked.  The "piracy" thing (actually called sharing) is the refusal of the old industry to adapt to the new, where everyone can be more equal and have access to the same content and distribution network as everyone else.  Yes, artists need to live in the current world, but they should realize that everyone equally needs to allow for the potential of more free future, not a more policed one.
Netflix profits off of trying to be the sole centralized bottleneck/toll booth for this content so that it can be policed and monitored, yet selectively distributed.  Its existence is a frankenstein of the old world with the new.  It exists to profit as the middleman.
Do you see the irony of me having to explain this to people on @_date: 2015-09-26 03:25:03
fuck gavin, he wants acceptance and is willing to sacrifice freedom for it. if you sacrifice the freedom in bitcoin because its a "payment system" it has no purpose.  I rather 10000 people like me use bitcoin for its freedom rather than for the next paypal. 
The same goes for this subreddit. Paypal 2.0 "acceptance" over freedom.

I dont value enforcing strict rules on how i experience, share, or remix that art with others.  When they allow me those freedoms, I will happily support them.  
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:57:45
I agree that miner incentive is necessary for obvious security reasons. Thats also why I believe that the blocksize limit doesnt need to be raised at all as well.
However, I also think there is a longer term problem with miner incentives that we cant solve right away.  [This presentation]( demonstrates one of those longer term problems.
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:14:30
Make transactions on top of the protocol, not in the protocol. The protocol should be for debt-settling alone. Banks settle debts at the end of the day, bitcoin can do it every 10 minutes, thats verifying and settling debts 144 more times per day than banks do.
@_date: 2015-09-29 16:17:46


Im not profit driven whatsoever so I cant defend why you would compromise security of a network in favor of profit. If bitcoin long term continues to be profit driven or even moreso by continually sacrificing more freedom and security, then I consider it failed anyways. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 15:47:29
anyone who wants to? If youre making 10000 transactions per month with the same person, why wouldnt you do that off the blockchain and use bitcoins smart contracts for enforcement? Otherwise, youre just bloating a network that many people rely on for its freedom and security, not its easy payments.  Besides, your transactions wont necessarily have to be on the public ledger in that way.
Take the tor network for example, a freely usable network. There are people that rely on its anonymity features everyday for their personal safety, and bandwidth is limited. Its generally frowned upon to use it for large bandwidth activities that dont require anonimity, for instance streaming movies.

" The fact that the blockchain can't support transactions on par with other payment platforms" 
Do you even know how payment platforms settle their debts? Do you think that a debt is settled instantly when someone creates a transaction from one bank account to another?
The answer is they dont.  They settle transactions at the end of the day.
Bitcoin settles debts every 10 minutes.
Think about that.
