he's already had a small taste of it before... 
right, Jihan? ;)

Pretty sure he said he had a problem with bitcoin but that he really liked the blockchain technology. Could be misremembering, though.

I like the cut of your jib.
He was using TOR, so it probably would have been extremely difficult to avoid captchas - especially in the likely case that any of the sites he used were using CloudFlare.

Ask them if they'd prefer 100 shares of a penny stock that will almost certainly do poorly or stay stagnant, or 10 shares of a premium stock that will certainly increase a lot in value.

Am American, can totally confirm. I think it's kind of funny that those exchanges in China didn't really get even licensed till now. 
And yet if you want to withdraw to a US bank... kyc all over the place. Bitfinex is even dropping US customers because of all the bureaucracy involved with anything financial.  
Maybe I'll get crushed and downvoted with ya here... but I don't really see how, aside from the legal system not being so prone to bribery (unless you're a lobbyist) that we are really all that different than the regimes we hate.

15k fully verified (at least mine is).

If I may ask, how though? 
And I don't mean cryptographically, really. What I mean is, what is really to stop them from arresting you until you give them what they want? (Not saying this will happen, but I am genuinely curious.)

No argument from me there. It's concerning to me too. They probably want to "steal" the blockchain technology but try to convince everyone that bitcoin is a fraud or whatever buzzword they're using at the moment (while secretly trading crypto and making money).

Thank you for trying to answer. I respect that they try to remain neutral, but I will  probably just move my coins to a hardware wallet around that time anyhow. Probably safer anyhow. 
Again, thank you, fellow Bitcoiner. :)

It really is a hard concept to disengage from. I definitely understand the confusion of newcomers, and I genuinely hope that they realize Bitcoin is being your own bank.
It can be really tricky when you trade, too, because even though you can have those coins you "HODL", you might also like to trade on crypto's volatility, and exchanges do make that quite convenient. There are decentralized exchanges, though they can be intimidating at first.

:D 
Well, you asked a question. It's not my job to sit on a high horse and judge you. Besides, your dino/Satoshi rhyme made me smile.

Meanwhile, trying not to wake my husband up checking crypto but I'm excited in case there's a possible jump to 6k. I think I have him converted, though. 
I like the website you linked, though. Notifications via messenger are pretty cool.

I hate to use the "I'm an $identity and here's my opinion", but you're being unfairly judged. 
As a female into crypto/tech, I fully agree with you. I find it ridiculous that you're being called a sexist/misogynist when you are just being realistic.
Everyone needs to be judged on their individual merit. That being said, we shouldn't exclude that there _are_ fundamental differences between the sexes. As you said, the vast majority of investors in crypto and self-made millionaires are men. It is just data. 
Everybody has equal rights, but that does not mean that literally everyone is equal. People are different, and it would honestly be a boring world if everyone were exactly the same. How would that world even work? The problem becomes when being an $identity prevents you from even entering a $career. *That is not the case.* If an $identity is talented at $career in a Western country, they can work in $career. 
If I may add a personal anecdote, I have found that being a female unfairly _advantages_ me in the tech field, rather than being a negative. People are automatically more interested in my work just because I'm female; however, I truly believe my work needs to stand on its own. I think this is unfair to men more talented than I, for the record. 
In short, if I as a female in tech/crypto cannot stand on my own merit, then I am worthless in that field. The point of the economy is creating value and giving opportunity to people that are talented in their particular fields... not give positions to people because some perceived societal belief. That's like a twisted form of nepotism.
I really liked your comment. For what an Internet stranger's opinion is worth, you've got a great head on your shoulders. In fact, I would bet as a rule of thumb that the more ad-hominem attacks you receive, the more practical you are. Best of luck to you, fellow Bitcoiner!

The memes and whatnot are just light hearted and keep the atmosphere around here a bit less grim. It might sound like religion to many, but on many posts asking for sincere financial advice, I've seen many people that warn that it is risky. 
Honestly, even though it's growing quickly and that can change communities, I feel as if the Bitcoin community is really great and they genuinely try to help others. 
TL;DR: Don't focus too much on price memes and know this is a subreddit for Bitcoin so people here probably love Bitcoin.

I had used Coinbase with almost zero problems while I was new to Bitcoin. I of course didn't use it to trade because it's more of a "PayPal Bitcoin" than an exchange and as thus, the fees are too high (if you want a Coinbase exchange, use GDAX). 
 However, after some time, they started canceling my transactions with absolutely no explanation and I had been doing nothing illegal nor fraudulent whatsoever. I then realized that what others say are true: not your keys, not your coins. If they had wanted to take all coins hostage and screw me over, they could have done so. 
They can, and do - just like a bank - take your money hostage because they can cancel any transaction that they wish for any reason, or even no reason at all. So, just like a bank, they decide which transactions that they want to process and which they don't. If you want that, then go back to Fiat or PayPal. I am not trying to sound elitist here, but if you use Coinbase, you are defeating the purpose of using Bitcoin. 
As I said before, I'm not trying to sound elitist. I am genuinely trying to help you understand all the hatred towards Coinbase. I hope this helps you and finds you well, fellow Bitcoiner. :)

I'm sorry if this has been asked before, but where does Kraken stand on this issue? I do not see them on the list of NYA signers but nor have I seen them speak about S2X whatsoever. 
Thanks in advance if anyone can answer this.

You're awesome. Just wanted to let you know that.
