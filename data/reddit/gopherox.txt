Thanks for your feedback.
Most of the brands we carry in clothing are geared towards a younger market, so the sizing does not usually run past women's Large.
We do have some phenomenal jewelry, handbags etc she might fancy!
Thanks for looking.

But they did consent. They put money into the contract. Did you put money into a contract without reading the code?
That's like signing a contract to buy a house without seeing the house, just taking a random stranger's word for it, and then handing them a briefcase of cash.
Don't blame the system for your stupidity.

It is not theft. There can not be theft in a smart contract, since the contract itself IS the law, and since that law mathematically absolutely can not be broken, you can not break the law and steal.
I would say maybe those participating in this smart contract should have read the code(law) a bit more thoroughly rather than just throwing money at something because it sounded cool.
Go break the law in Saudi Arabia or somewhere like that and tell them you didn't read it so they should hard fork (rewrite) their laws to suit you and then let you go. Let us know how that works out.
