No one knows.  No one. 
The bear market started as soon as people could short the market with futures.  Before then you could only sell Bitcoin if you owned it, 
there were always more buyers than sellers... so you had to pry it from someone's hands that wanted it.  People who didn't believe in Bitcoin simply didn't buy any, there wasn't another option. 
The market will turn around when they (the shorters, non believers) don't feel safe in that position anymore.  Our Friday night jump was short position contracts expiring.  Last Friday of the month at 4pm est.
6pm est tomorrow night futures trading opens again.  If people get back in their short positions, price will continue to fall.

Fear.  Inflation. Collapse.

Yes. You are agreeing to buy something or sell something for a fixed price at a future date.  Airlines do this with oil and farmers do this with crops to remove uncertainty.

In the futures market you agree to buy Bitcoin in the future at a lower price than the current market price.  If the price goes up you lose money because you agreed to buy it at a lower price.  If the price goes lower you make money because your future Bitcoin costs less.  You never actually buy the Bitcoin...it's just a way to gamble on it very leveraged.  Most contracts end at the end of the month or quarter.

Will there be a BTC short ETF too?  Everyone thought futures would be great but this crash started the day they came online. (and people could short it)

I'm one of those people.  I hope they all buy.  Helps everyone.  Started getting in back in November.  Rode the Dec highs...and the since then lows.

Maybe Reddit is for younger men, and so is crypto.  My dad doesn't know much about either...but he has stocks.
