I expected a words of 6 yo kid about cryptos.... 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:37:51
Mine crashed after a few days. The value of it was almost nothing after a few weeks waiting for service :/ . 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:27:18
:) not soo bad . 
@_date: 2018-01-07 20:31:47
They did not accept bitcoin ever. They always had fiat from payment processor .
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:10:04
As community we need nation like them. Also, it does not cost you a lot to say "thank you" :) 
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:09:46
I was crying when I read it for a first time.

Making one transaction for fun will cost you money (blockchain fee). You need to open a chanel with someone and that will take usuall bitcoin transaction fee. The chanel should be opened with the other party which is interested in making many transactions with you.

waiting for mainnet boom :) 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:22:18
Monthy python style :) 
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:46:29
What if one of the side of chanel dies? What version of agreement does the other side "show" to blockchain? Do they choose the best one instead the last one? 
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:20:42
It is more Bitcoin Cash than Bitcoin :P

I support Mundi Plumarii Foundation and I recommend them.  
One advantage is that everyone who donate receive physical embroidered patch with Bitcoin logo on it. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:41:23
You might be right. This is why the service I saw a few years ago had an option to automatically sweep the wallet after one year. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:00:11
I am from PL. I must say that the warn is not so bad. It is true that they warn against cryptocurrencies but....  They say many pretty useful things for newbies... like: Look after your private key, keep it in safe place. If you lose it than you will not able to recover your coins etc. They explaining that cryptocurrency is different than fiat. They explaining that cryptocurrency is not connected with bank. They say that there is no connection with government. 
Basically, the government of Poland wants to be justified in case someone lose his bitcoins.

Finally I used CONTABO. C\-lightning works fine 
@_date: 2017-03-01 11:09:48
Do you understand rates ? "view rate" "like rate" and "follower rate" is clear for me. What does it mean "Daily Cap 2$ per day?" 
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:04:50
It was very difficult for me to persuade one of the seller in China to use Bitcoins. Most of you are right saying that it would be great if we can withdraw CNY directly from bitcoin Chinese bitcoin exchange. Unfortunately, I spent a few hours researching and noticed that there is no offer like that.

You need to remember to pay $ your hosting provider 2 years in advance. ... just in case you die

@_date: 2016-11-15 07:31:42
Share your love and get embroidered patch 
@_date: 2016-12-24 11:16:03
It is always good idea to buy bitcoins unless 1 satoshi = 1 USD
@_date: 2016-11-08 21:32:14
Good job. Thank you for posting and sharing. 
I would recommend to add two things:
1. The conclusion/summary is missing. It would be great idea if you could say which one is the best. 
2. Your bitcoin address for donations !

@_date: 2018-07-07 06:19:04

What speed is recommended? What data amount could be used per month? 
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:45:25
Digital Ocean is top quality :) I was thinking about 10 - 15 USD per month.
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:41:12
The line has already crossed the "buy gold" line!
@_date: 2017-05-27 06:13:36
Than...to be honest, you should return those bitcoins to the owner. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:59:19
Great job! 
@_date: 2018-12-19 10:32:45
love it !

The world should say "goodbye" to facebook ! Strange. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 11:22:25
Just received reply from Facebook.
 


























So... I am going to have a great day. No.. .CUCKerBURG anymore. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 10:24:40
I wait reply from FB on my review request and than test again. thanks
@_date: 2018-12-19 09:51:43
Selling cryptocurrency related gadgets is also illegal...  from the point of view of facebook 
Should I ask the administrator to temporarily remove that? Strange. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:19:23
What I think is that Facebook could one day ban all businesses which accept cryptocurrency as payment method. It is dangerous for cryptocurrencies. People will start removing the payment method just to make sure that their FB account is safe. 
@_date: 2016-07-05 13:57:23


I really like the approach to the topic
@_date: 2018-12-19 10:11:34
... and thank you for checking it deeply.
