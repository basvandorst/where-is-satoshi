Everyone started using Bitcoin, so I'll use bitcoin too!

Is it safe? Is it the one found in play store when searching for Samourai Wallet?
Just wanna be sure lol, I have heard a lot about samourai wallet too.
Just want to support the networking and get transfered into a segwit address.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:58:13
Yeah sorry about that! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:58:12
Yeah why would he lose? He did not do a trade. He did not sell (unless he did later). 
So he didn't have any capital gains and did no asset for asset trade.
Please explain how does he have IRS tax to pay.

Just created a segwit address and transfered my btc into it.
Already got a confirmation with a 5sat/byte fee in less than a minute.
Total fee: 0.10usd
When the network is working as it should, bitcoin is simply brilliant.
Can't wait for LN and more segwit support.

I've come to terms with myself that 99% of the people in this world are stupid and not worth my time as a person. Might seem that you are going/already went through this phase already too.

And do you realize that for what I said to be true it means that the tx got processed in the very next block, do you? 
I just didnt want to post the full time of the tx. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:05:23
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:48:53
He traded it from a wallet (that i believe is his own, not an exchange) into another wallet of his own.
It's still his posessions.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:33:40
Did a 5 Sat/byte tx today from a legacy address to a segwit address, confirmed in next block. Did it 30 seconds before 10 minutes mark, confirmed by 10 minutes and 5 seconds.

And normal economics do not really apply to bitcoin, or crypto in general.
This is all unpredictable and volatile.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:30:31
I'd say to try and check the email address, when you remember it, in the major exchanges, see if you have any luck.
@_date: 2018-01-06 19:49:25
Exchange means a place where you buy / sell bitcoin.
Like Coinbase / Other exchanges that could've been possible up at the time of the buy.
So technically, I guess she didn't get them into a private wallet address, so it should be in the exchange.
If you get the date of the buy / emails she could've owned at the time / major exchanges at the time of the buy (or other exchanges up at the time), you might have some luck and recover the account.
If she transfered them into her wallet thats a whole complete different beast and most likely gone if she doesn't remember the seed password.

Money is finite. Now, the concept of lending without actually having it is what makes fiat seem infinite, since well, it doesnt exist to start with.
Now, Bitcoin is divisable, and I can prove to you that between any 2 integers (an interval) there are infinite rational numbers (numbers that can be written as a fraction).
So that means we can divide bitcoin into how many parcels we want.
You do not need to own a BTC.
Owning 1BTC at a value of 1000 is not different from owning 0.1BTC at a value of 10000.
As such, althought it as a finite supply, it doesn't mean you have to use the currency as it is. If USD was worth 10x more, you could pay something that costs 1 USD with 0.10USD.
@_date: 2018-01-15 04:05:11
Im confused, what are you replying to? I'm talking about what network effect is to explain to the guy who just got his posts deleted. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:54:43
So we would have 2 returns to normal? The graphs are already different.
Stop spreading FUD.

Promptly upgrading its software code  
Distributed ledgers who must have consensus to update the software.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:54:35
Its just a way of talking. What matters is that it got cleared on next block 
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:41:21
Using samourai wallet, it was pretty fast to set it up.
Features are pretty nice and the UI is very good.
A huge step up from mycelium lol.
@_date: 2018-01-08 20:19:11
At a given point in time it is finite.
@_date: 2018-01-28 17:13:29
I started a wallet there, in process of transfering from mycelium to my new segwit address!
This is so impressive, can't wait for it to get confirmed!
Anyways, I saved the passphrase and the backup seed, so I can swipe those in any segwit address if Samourai stops support right?

Ripple tanking now too. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:54:59
Id say biggest manipulation in history. This was very shady from coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:36:47
i believe mempool clearing, I think the block count went up to 11 or something from 5-6.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:10:25
Some very big walls on the run to 13.6k
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:43
I actually see XRP Having future tho, I'm trying to get into it too.
The best thing is to diversify your portfolio right?
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:13:00
Need to break that 300 something sell order at 13.6k, there doesnt seem to be a wall beyond that so far.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:24:13
Check the sell and buy order book. When big sells pop up its called a wall. Like 100+ btc sell orders.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:17:12
If you check the Sell/Buy order book, sometimes you will see huge amounts of btc appearing at a certain price. Those are called walls.
For example, if there's a wall of 300 btc at 14k, price wont raise until those whole 300 btc are bought. So if anyone wants to sell their faster, they will have to sell it for under 14k, causing prices to dip.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:17:33
I just feel that, if no trading is going on in coinbase, which actually caused this huge spike (and all the inside information going on too), i just believe that if we pull through this, we gonna come back stronger than ever.
All the money that left BTC today to BCH would just flow back in, pumping the prices back again.
Now, my question is, if no trading is going on, and people just bought, are they in a state of 'freeze' as in, they can't sell or buy, so basically the coin is worthless for now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:30:58
you always own X coins. IF value rises, your money rises lol.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:02:34
Wondering the same, I keep mine on a wallet, how do we claim the forked coins?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:00:33
17.5k now boys!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:27:17
If you have the recovery phrase, you should be able to recover the wallet almost anywhere.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:05:04
Serious Question:
Seeing how the BCCash is selling at 3.5k but coinbase has put it up for ~9k with such a gigantic wall, isn't it basically gonna crash itself since people won't buy/sell because they think it will rise to 9k and when it doesnt, panic will kick in and the price is gonna hit bottom rockhard?
Or just me not understanding a thing about this?

@_date: 2018-02-06 18:11:45
Peace of mind about getting in. When things get rough.
It suggests no correlation at all lol.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:20:59
Ahh the good old sell low buy high!
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:13:37
If you care about bitcoin, you won't care about the price. Hence no correlation.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:37:06
Learn about the technology. Seriously. This is the most important step.
Understand what bitcoin is about, and if you are into it and believe it, invest into it. Will save you a lot of headaches. 
Further more, you can check some of the exchanges and see where you wanna buy. You got places like Gemini and a lot of others.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:41:10
Its not about the correlation. It's about peace of mind.
