Its not panic sell its shorting the crash and buying back in even more. If i sell right before the supposed crash, I can more then double my coins in time for the rebound that we all know will follow.

I felt horrible when first learned that he isnt at least a millionaire and then i got a little pissed at him because i felt like he didnt truely beleive in bitcoin because if he really beleived in the tech so much he would have had a savings or nestegg for when bitcoin appreciates. Then i realized he was lying. He doesnt care who thinks he's wealthy he just would rather not get the attention and posibly be a target for hackers. Ya im speculating but i doubt very much he didnt plan for this kind of a appreciation in value, just maybe not this soon

This is so insane that Im starting to think all the bubble talk was on to something. Growth is one thing but this is something else. HODL strong eveyone!

All i saw in this video was a demonstration of 3 steps forward one step back. Tells me a crash is coming. So if history repeats, the rebound will go even higher.
