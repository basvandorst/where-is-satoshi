OP is the biggest shill. How can mods allow blatant profitable shilling?
@_date: 2018-01-04 13:46:45
I noticed this too. Specifically that Yahoo is  finance sites in page views and coinmarketcap is  lol.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:41:50
Not fair, you can actually transact with the EURO.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:52:38
Thanks for the link in case there's more confusion here.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:55:06
Hey now, got some info incorrect man. It's CBOE releasing futures first, and it's next Sunday not Monday.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:42:22
It's actually Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:00:50
I think it's more along the lines of buy pressure is specifically increased on GDAX.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:14:50
It's not. It's coming Dec 10th Sunday with CBOE launching the first product.
@_date: 2018-05-12 23:15:27
Washed up has-been? Yeah sounds about right.
@_date: 2018-05-19 22:47:29
And the masonic symbol.
@_date: 2018-05-15 00:52:25
Faced the same banking bullshit my dude. Two words my good friend: CREDIT UNION.
@_date: 2017-01-07 11:34:14
I'm willing to bet the 'dicks' to you were 'hodlers' who ultimately don't care about the price movements. They're just egotistical people with unrealistic expectations towards asset growth.
@_date: 2016-06-12 00:51:35
Oh baby a triple!
@_date: 2017-01-04 13:05:53
Truer words have never been said. A true patriot.
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:21:09
@_date: 2017-01-12 09:00:59
And effectively kill bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-01-03 09:57:48
It's not a wrong statement. A wrong statement would be criminals use btc over fiat general speaking.
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:31:45
That would be 'cheese pizza'. Pizza alone is *not* child porn. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 11:15:25
Also panic died down a bit because of today's news.
@_date: 2017-01-23 02:09:00
Idk dude. China is corrupt asf.
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:46:04
Okay I thought I was the only one who believes there's going to be a short term bitcoin rally on inaug day.
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:39:46
Yes. 100k is a smaller number than 10m you can borrow.
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:20:11
Images used in texts such as ��������
@_date: 2016-12-22 11:05:53
Think at this point Bitcoin will never go below 300-400 again unless there's some systematic disaster occurs
@_date: 2017-01-23 03:21:06
Yeah people shouldn't act like the chinese populace has wealth to invest.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:28:06
There's a distinct lack of buckets filled with tears if it was an ETH hodler meme.
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:42:52
I mean that's supposed to be the pro to autocracy... but history shows how that goes
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:49:25
If you're smart you'll use smart money on your smart phone while watching smart idiots (BBT) on your smart tv..
yo dawg..
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:32:39
He wasn't wrong.  You could say $1 trillion and it holds true. So saying $.25 trillion is the same and correct.
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:40:37
Nice I just bought some pizza myself. Pepperoni and the other Hawaiian. Paid 0 btc as well, all fiat!
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:02:51
Try adding to your bitpay wallet
@_date: 2018-02-19 03:10:31
He mentioned electronic airdropping. So none of the people conducting the experiment would need to be in Venezuela 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:51:55
Jeez, what a foul little person you are.
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:58:36
Tell me where I can rent for 1k in SF 
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:16:03
That sounds manual.
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:50:18
Was thinking that myself
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:10:14
*Fuckin' way she goes.*
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:48:51
Lawyer up
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:24:22
Ummm this is photoshopped lmao
Edit: hell maybe not even that, MS Paint. You guys really that gullible? 
@_date: 2018-04-21 05:11:55
Wake me up when its all over.
@_date: 2018-04-29 18:38:23


I think you mean cap gains tax.
@_date: 2018-04-15 01:43:59
That's the point
@_date: 2018-04-20 06:24:04
This is borderline stalking lmao. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 21:50:56
Comparing btc to isis, yeah that's enough internet for me today. Daaaamn people are DUMB
