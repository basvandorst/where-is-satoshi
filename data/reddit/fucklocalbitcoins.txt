Sure I can respond anecdotally as well:  I've traded multiple times without the need for escrow and have had flawless trades as both buyer and seller. Giving your coins to a third party and you're asking for trouble (imo).  The main point being having the option to do so for each person's needs, trust, risk tolerance etc.
Can't agree that it "seems fair."  Fair would be "it's detailed in the TOS and a user violated the TOS."  Otherwise by definition it's not anywhere close to [fair](

Thx.  Will check it.  
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:47:03
1.  As mentioned already in the OP, escrow does not [100%] [insure against scams](
2.  Find a better revenue model and offer more useful services.


Ever hear of Facebook?  Twitter?


Because (again as stated) the risks/costs (i.e. speed and security) greatly outweigh the rewards. 
eBay states you cannot go outside of their platform in their TOS.

Heh np.  Thanks for taking the time read and respond.  Keep that game face you got going on and you'll be vacationing in the Bahamas yet.  Or as they say on LBC "Forced Holiday."
@_date: 2015-08-26 09:14:10
Beautiful.  Will do. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:38:28
Eh, you win some, you get downvoated some :~/
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:19:57
Well no. In that case according to your example, it would be like advertising on LBC for a site that was like LBC and not just posting and making trades. 
Which is actually spelled out in the TOS.
@_date: 2015-08-26 02:57:53
I don't think that means what you think  it means/want it to mean.  
What you are quoting is LBC's reserved right to change its website/discontinue certain services and dictate its rules, which it has.  And not one that disallows trades outside of escrow.


We may cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time or modify or discontinue our Services. Additionally, we reserve the right to refuse or terminate our Services to anyone for any reason at our discretion.
THAT means what you want it to mean.  Cept that's from eBay.  
@_date: 2015-08-26 02:49:15
^This is intellectually dishonest. 


It's absolutely related.  The site doesn't just have a tipjar wallet address.  In order for them to collect revenue you have to send coins through their wallet service, wait 3 confirmations, and then complete a trade.  Heck, if they JUST had a tip jar I'd give them 1% for the networking, but I'm not sending them coins to live on their severs/storage.  Maybe you're too young to remember the story of Gox.
I know it was TL and you DR, but the security was only one argmuent. There's also wallet providers which may or may not be able to tell if coins end up at LBC and may not be too thrilled if they think so.  That's definitely in their TOS as Orwellian as it seems.  One false move with them... so there's more added risk.  In my experience, you pay to avoid risk, not incur more. 
Why take 30+ minutes to complete something that takes 30 seconds that's not spelled out in TOS?  


I do use CL.


Apparently they do because I did (?).
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:34:50


Facebook does that but with no escrow/fee.  Craigslist does that with no escrow/fee. Even Twitter could do that.  
Their defining feauture *is* their escrow in addition to being a *free* platform to connect.  


No, if *everyone* did what I did they would either come up with new/better/desired services, build a better revenue model, or perhaps they'd just ban everyone.
Your way of thinking is the same thinking that lead to the failuers of Kodak and Blockbuster.

Glad you took the time to read it.  
@_date: 2015-08-26 08:43:13


I don't think that means what you think it means/want it to mean. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:00:17
Correct. But this isn't an issue of whether escrow should or should not be used or available. It's there to use.  Wonderful.  If you don't want to use it and seeing how their TOS mention nothing explicitly about not using it, then it is up to the buyer and seller whether to use it or not. 
@_date: 2015-08-30 22:55:43
Well since it's not a legal matter...
But no.  TOS = TOS.  Sorry man.  
I still &lt;3 u though. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:16:24


I don't disagree that LBC should *offer* protection which buyers and sellers may opt to use. 
It's more than just buyers that make a market though.  You can't have buyers without suppliers. 
Thanks for the info, I will be checking you guys out. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:04:25


Should've kept reading bro.

Air is free.  Would you feel the right to whinge after it was taken away from you but right before you asphyxiated?
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:12:58
Completely agree.  I (used to) tell everyone I knew about LBC as a place to find local traders and get repeat trades (for buyers) regardless of whether or not I traded with them.  In my profile I even advise everyone to trade carefully and be safe.  All in all, just take care of both parties and if you can't, let the buyers and sellers work it out, or as you alluded, give them the tools to be able to do so. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:53:25
Well no, it would be more like if I went to a pub, was super nice to everyone, picked up 3 girls, drank nothing, and then was ~~asked to leave~~ kicked out and told I could never return. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:01:22


Now that (if I remember correctly)  **is** against their TOS.
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:14:42
Sure. 
It's not in their TOS.
I have a track record of positive feedback.
I have a history dating back 2+ years. 
I've never had a dispute over funds. 
I was never issued a warning or any courtesy by staff. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:06:25
Nope, apparently not as I see it now. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 08:41:34
You (purposely) misunderstand.  The reason for direct trades is to directly send coins from my wallet to theirs, to not have to wait for 3 confirmations, and to always remain in control of my private keys.  If you want to oretend it's about dodging a 1% fee, that's your own free will.  
If you do not have contol of the private keys then all you have is an IOU.  If this isn't something you're practicing, then that's on you however I never stray from this practice.  Anything that lives on servers elsewhere is at risk. 


@_date: 2015-08-26 14:54:34


Taking it to straight to Reddit like a champ is how it's done, it'd seem.
Re-read the OP.
Much assumptions you make.  If a company is offering (or forcing) escrow but cannot keep to TOS and you are a seller but not concerned over this, then perhaps you'd be the first to steal that slice of pizza. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:33:09
Thanks for the response.  
I almost considered spending a few satoshis on just building the confirmed rep.  It's kind of like advertisement.  But after reading [this]( it just seemed like a bad idea to mix any coins from my US based exchanges/wallets to anything having to do with LBC.  At that point It's pointless to take added risk on both ends...plus the time it takes, plus the security loss of not holding the private keys...and I'm literally paying for all of these disservices. 
However, had it been explicitly stated in their TOS, then I wouldn't have said anything when I got the message from the admins.  But it doesn't, there was no warning, and it was just a "forced holiday" as they put it which they do not want to lift. 
So yeah... fuck em
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:11:03
Directions would = TOS.  And nothing I did was against TOS.  So no.
@_date: 2015-08-26 02:29:15


What's not comparable between LBC FB and Twitter?


I agree.  This is why things like agreements are written down-- so there exists no ambiguity. 
Bottom line is if something is worth buying to the customer, they will buy it.
I agree there could be room (I wouldn't go so far as to say *this* somehow provides an incentive but rather opens the door for competition) for a game changer to step in. 
edit: formatting
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:57:43


That's funny, I can't seem to find that anywhere in their TOS.  You mind copying and pasting that part for us?
@_date: 2015-08-26 03:48:53
Ah, gotcha.  I follow you now. 
They benefited in other ways (i.e. branding, awareness).  Which is fair.
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:14:24
@_date: 2015-08-26 10:52:59
Definitive word being **unless**.  Grade school bro.  Keep re-reading it until you get it. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 11:23:18
Think of it this way (or not), would you pay a premium for you and your best friend to sit in traffic when the HOV (car pool) lane is free and open?  If yes, then really there's no more need for an argument.  Think what you may, but if you've been in Bitcoin as long as I have, you know to always always keep your coins and private keys.  That's the point (one of the big points) of bitcoin-- not having to trust a centralized third, be your own bank, control your own assets etc.  
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:15:15
That was actually what I was thinking of re: the eBay thing.  A la carte.
@_date: 2015-08-26 17:35:31
Right, cept it wasn't freeloading nor was it against TOS.  To kick someone out and say "you friggin' freeloader" is one thing but to try and pretend it's part of your TOS when it isn't is another. 
@_date: 2015-08-26 13:46:32
In layman's-- if it's not required or expressed in the terms, then there's no grounds to say it is required or against the terms. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 23:11:17
This isn't a tale of "dodging 1%."  It's "move your coins here to our servers, place it in our escrow, it all may or may not be secure, you may or may not get scammed, AND this will all cost you a 1% inconvenience fee."
I can appreciate your effort. However if the service they provide (use of escrow/their wallets) was a service which was worth it (saves time, saves money, [100%] insures against theft/scams) then I would have no problem using it.  But as pointed out before, the site has been hacked in the past, people have used escrow to scam, and waiting for 3 confirmations is a slow process. To some this is ok and *worth* the 1% while to others, that 1% can be used more advantageously and faster trades made.
As mentioned , eBay used to allow sellers to *choose* which method of payment they were willing to accept i.e. money order, check, paypal according to that seller's needs.  They also had a revenue structure to support their efforts.  Although now they *explicitly* do not allow checks or money orders.  But they are also less competitive by doing so. 
Since using the escrow system can backfire (as mentioned in the OP) and your coins are not secure if you do not have the private keys, the service does not woo everyone.
It's not about *dodging* their fee structure, it's about providing a service that people are willing to use and therfore pay for it.  If users are willing to take the risk and not use the escrow/wallet service (for a number of reasons including but not limited to: built trust/rapport, **speed**, or security) then LBC would do themselves well by coming up with a different revenue model (i.e. ads) or add improved services-- not alienate their user base.  Remember, you're not being charged a fee to browse listings or ping their servers even though this contributes to their overhead. 
Watering it down to dodging a % is intellectually dishonest.  For one, it means a trader can be more competitive by reducing costs.  This in addition to speedier trades for the buyer.


That is literally stealing. Choosing not to order an item off the menue because you don't like it does not entitle the resteraunt to debit your banking account. Unless of course you agreed to this before hand. 
Again I appreciate your comment, and I will say I am at least glad you're not the person behind localbitcoins.  
Or maybe you are...
**edit some things 
@_date: 2015-08-30 09:08:30
Correct, which is why there is an option for escrow, reputation, and face to face trades. 
"Not having a market" would imply there are no buyers or sellers willing to trade, which is less to do with one particular website and more to with good ol' supply and demand. 
Not sure how anyone who gets scammed is left holding anything let alone a bag though.. The way you'd get scammed is if someone got both your money and your coins i.e. both "bags."
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:13:56
I can sort of respect that.  
If you weigh it as "You're avoiding the 1%" then you're missing the entire point. It's about speed, service, rapport, and staying competitive.  If you can offer the same thing quicker, cheaper, and be responsive then people will flock to you.  And as mentioned, I have no desires to get coins locked up on LBC for any reason, to risk being scammed through escrow, or to have any of my wallet providers even [think coins are going to LBC](  I get scammed/lose money and then I can't service others. 
It's not "directing every single customer to avoid escrow."  No one I trade with *cares* about escrow.  Some people do.  When I first started buying coins, I didn't care about escrow.  I cared about finding a reputable trader and repeating business or doing face-to-face trades. 
I see nothing in their TOS about it and I've never had any issues prior nor even a warning. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 14:19:48


If you're calling the use of a free service "freeloading" then your use of Reddit or Facebook or Google is also freeloading.  
@_date: 2015-08-26 00:37:39
Ok, quit leeching Facebook and buy ads.  The list goes on.  If it's not in the TOs then it's not in the TOS.
@_date: 2015-08-26 12:57:43
Escrow means a third-party will decide in the case of a dispute between a buuer and seller.  If you are the seller, and based on how they have not stuck to their TOS already, you'd be wise to question whether or not you'd be protected by the escrow if a scam/dispute ever arose.
