In this case you’re describing, you don’t really own the bitcoins. You’ve just been given a promise of having bitcoins, when in fact you don’t. The reason why you can spend those bitcoins with a bank card is because there is a custodian, the bank, who promises you that you own the bitcoins when in fact you don’t. Try really owning bitcoins with a real wallet. You will quickly understand that no one but you owns your bitcoins and also that you do need a new infrastructure to move them quickly around without trusting a third party. That infrastructure is lightning network.

This is at best improbable. In order for btc to have value it must be tradeable. Furthermore, in trillion dollar markets, having just a small percentage of one btc is enough for your monthly payments. Gold is centralized, but if one wishes to buy gold one can. It's just not useful for small daily payments. On the other hand LN payments use real btc, not some representation of it. So we should be safe.

Good strategy. Much better than buying a lottery ticket. And probably you'll learn more about the investment you made, and start to appreciate the underlying fundamental concept of Bitcoin and what it brings with it.

The code is copyable. The infrastructure of nodes is not. Neither the current security of bitcoin, which is obtained from all the energy put into proof-of-work. Copying Bitcoin as a whole is almost impossible nowadays. Anyone who would really want to do that, would probably be better off just by joining Bitcoin network. Most crypto currencies are a technological joke compared to Bitcoin, and some are plain old scams. The remaining ones who are arguably better than Bitcoin, still have a long walk to walk before proving what Bitcoin has proven.
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:55:56
I'm using an analogy here. Bitcoin is built to simulate a scarce resource, so gold is a good example. Doesn't mean there's a cryptocurrency for every metal out there. How would you try to value something that is completely new? Probably using an analogy. My argument is that Bitcoin's value should be much higher than it is right now, due to being a digital scarce resource. Doesn't mean it will have the exact value of the market cap of gold or any other metal or asset class. But from my point of view, it's a completely new way of representing value, that will change the future of economy.
@_date: 2018-11-25 14:36:07
You sure are well versed for someone giving such a dumb opinion. If you think lack of usability and late time to market is what's going to kill Bitcoin, you're in for a surprise. Bitcoin is the best form of money ever invented. It has been proving it works for a decade now. It has been given scalability with Lightning Network. It's backed up by energy and math, and secured by cryptography. Your money is backed up and secured by state interests. Good luck with that. If you had your bank account in Cyprus of Venezuela, perhaps you wouldn't be talking like a well groomed statist.

Bitcoin is the digital equivalent of gold. Consider the market cap of gold and project it to Bitcoin and calculate the value of one Bitcoin. Consider also that contrary to gold, Bitcoin is secured by cryptography, and transferable as digital information. Bitcoin is the future. It's the first creation of something with digital properties that can't be copied.

You're clearly biased from a first-world point of view. You should've been in Cyprus or Venezuela during the latest crisis. Those are the places where Bitcoin is most needed. Try waking up one day and having your bank account frozen or having lost 99.995% of your savings.

It's completely crazy the FUD around here these days. I guess part of this must be paid sock puppets to put fear on gullible minds. The difference in opinion on the future of crypto from last year to this moment is shocking. It's like most people don't know or care anymore about the fundamentals of the technology. Perhaps they didn't understand it in the first place. They don't understand the potential of this technology, and how much change it will bring in the future. Moments ago I read someone stating something like: "I traded real money for fake internet money". This statement says everything about how uninformed the average crypto buyer is. I don't know how low we'll go, as I didn't know how high we ended up going, but the future of money will be crypto, and we're not even close to reaching its potential. We haven't really started. So yeah, people are f...ing morons.

What you mean can't be made illegal? A state can legalize or prohibit anything they choose. Of course they would prohibit the use of a currency that would circumvent theirs. Anyway, making something illegal doesn't mean it won't be used. Ever heard of drugs? Bitcoin's usability is only getting better each day. And 50% loss in less than one month is orders of magnitude better than what happened the bolivar.

No, Bitcoin was declared illegal there. Didn't stop them from using it. They didn't use it as a currency though, they used it as a store of value. Adoption will take a long time still.

Each cryptocurrency has its own characteristics. Ethereum has an inflationary model built in the emission of its coins, so it isn't as scarce as Bitcoin. Furthermore, Ethereum isn't as secure as Bitcoin, due to having a much larger attack surface, which has been exploited many times before. Also, Ethereum will have to fundamentally change in order to scale. It's a completely different beast. From my perspective, Ethereum shouldn't have risen in value as much as it did. Litecoin is also a different. You can copy the code of a cryptocurrency, but you can't copy it's infrastructure, or it's current proof-of-work, or its current development team. Litecoin is a blatent copy of Bitcoin, and has ridden the wave of crypto speculation. When the tides recede is when you get to see who was been swimming naked.

We don't mention a central authority for confirming identity, it could be completely decentralized, Onename is an example of that. If mining is decentralized, and everyone gets a cut, what's the problem of being associated to a person? Don't we all have very public profiles?
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:50:28
Thank you for your support. In fact I loved the discussions. Unfortunately I don't have many opportunities to discuss these issues with my peers because we are mostly focused on standard software development, and blockchain technology is still somewhat at a distance. Although everyone was against me, I loved the arguments and I learned a lot from them. I still believe that a miner should be unequivocally linked to something with material existence that isn't copiable/clonable by the millions, and a person fits the bill very nicely, but I understood that privacy is an big issue, and  that identities can be forged, especially when dealing with nation state attacks. Perhaps there's an alternative.
@_date: 2016-05-21 10:15:22
All files are binary my friend. The extension is pdf, so unless it exploited a vulnerability of your pdf reader, it couldn't be a virus. Regarding your questions, the document clearly states that only miners need to be identified, not regular users. AI couldn't create fake docs, you need external authorities confirmations. It would have to hack them all. And if it could do that, it could also hack bitcoin miners, and send the mined coins to different addresses, every, time, someone, mined. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 18:09:28
Since I posted this I've been studying proof of identity/person systems, anti face spoofing techniques and anti sybil attacks. It seems to be a long discussed topic around it. If you could have a hash of a face, that was undeniably based on a real face - a proof of person -, and a proof of freshness - proving the hash was freshly made from a different (real) image the last one was, you would have an sybil attack killer. If every time a miner mined, he had to unlock his mined coins with a proof of person and proof of freshness during a predifined time limit, otherwise the coins would be "burnt", the effort to sybil this would be enormous. And you could remain anonymous. Only a hash of your face would be known. But I guess this could be hacked too...
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:50:59
I'm familiar with the concepts of a Sybil attack and proof of stake. Having to prove your identity prevents Sybil attacks, provided it's hard enough to fake identities. I'm not sure proof of stake is in fact the solution to a low energy blockchain that is truly descentralized and resistant to attacks.
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:28:09
I don't agree. Just because someone is identified, doesn't mean you can trust them. Furthermore, you need an history which everyone has to agree on, where a side-history is hard and not worth it to produce. You can achieve this by a large group of identified miners and rules set that limit how they mine. And this must be stored in blockchain.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:42:22
Ok, for the first version of the application we consider the threshold fixed at (2/3)N blocks for not being able to mine since the last block mined. So, it's possible you could mine a little quicker than the average, but not probable. Now what? The main issue is on having multiple fake identities. If you had 2 highly confirmed faked identities, you could mine twice instead of once. If you had 100 you could mine 100 times more.
@_date: 2016-05-20 22:55:27
They will be mining, and they will get their coins, but at an expected regular pace. I think I know where you are going with this. Why remain in the network if you have no chance of mining right away after you have mined a block, right?
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:00:33
In a perfect setting it shouldn't be usable for N-1 number of blocks on a network of N miners. But that is too strict. I could give you a number, for example (2/3)N blocks it shouldn't mine a block. But you could build an algorithm that would adjust these thresholds based on the blocks you've mined on the past. The high hashes won't help you with block mining restrictions in place and with a low number of addresses.
@_date: 2016-05-20 19:28:21
You should consider the number of miners. If you have 5000 miners, you would mine 1 block per 5000 blocks from a probabilistic perspective. So you could, one average, mine 100 blocks from every 5000 blocks with your 100 accounts, provided you have them. If you're colluding with your family and friends, its just a normal outcome of the system.
@_date: 2016-05-21 17:39:39
It's not an external authority, it's plural, authorities, and they don't call the shots, they just confirm your identity. Anyway, at that point you still need a blockchain, because you need an history of events everyone agrees with and is difficult and not worth it to fake on a sidechain. Identifying someone doesn't mean trusting them. If you know a way to achieve consensus with identified miners and sql databases without a blockchain like paradigm, please tell me, I definitely prefer to use a sql database than to fuck around with blocks or chains.
@_date: 2016-05-21 22:52:03
Thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:17:44
I'm not sure requiring trust is going backwards. You don't require trust from one entity alone, it's from many entities, and it's just to confirm your identity. How many fake identities can you produce that are backed by many external authorities? And lets say you manage that and you provide these confirmations as proof for your identity every time you mine. It requires a small effort to call these  authorities and point out your fake identities. They are registered publicly on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:05:01
I completely understand your thoughts. Proof of work is just math and science. But look at the mining farms, all that energy wasted. Isn't there a better way to do this? And consider the probabilities of providing multiple proofs of identification. It's based on trust, but also on probabilities.
@_date: 2016-05-21 20:41:40

@_date: 2016-05-20 19:07:49
Good question, nothing would prevent you. But it wouldn't take you very far because the system wouldn't allow you to mine with the same addresses many times repeatedly. It would consider it as recent mining.
@_date: 2016-05-21 18:24:06
By authorities I don't mean just government authorities, I'm talking about google, facebook, twitter, linkedin, paypal, etc plus government authorities, international authorities, private authorities, etc. The possibility of all these guys colluding to fake identities is a long shot to put it mildly, the same for hackers that are able to hack them all. And you need to consider what you mean by a hack. To create such a strongly confirmed identity, would require enourmous efforts, just so you could raise the chances of mining a block here and there. I know a way to do that easier on bitcoin, just double my asic power and I'm on the go. And what does that lead to, centralization. The ones who've got the money to spend on asic hardware are the ones who win the most coins. It's highly centralized, and you need to consider the possibility of low end miners loosing interest and calling it quits, which would result in an enourmous bubble burst. A bunch of millionaires with warehouses filled with asic hardware and worthless virtual coins. Not a pretty sight. I believe the only way to keep it decentralized is to tie the system to real things that can't be created or copied by the millions. Pleople seem to fit this nicely, especially the people who will get the coins. This also leads to more transparency, because you know to whom the money was issued to.
@_date: 2016-05-20 20:52:25
Your answer just cheered me up. When you mention states and fake identities by the masses, it becomes interesting. If a state did that, we could just cut them out of the network. And they would get serious bad rep. And it would cost them a lot to bribe worldwide external authorities. In fact, a state interested in doing that, could do the same for bitcoin with hash power. And the result would be the same, they would be cut out from the game.

I don't understand the relation with the banking system. You don't need to trust one person/entity alone. Given I provide you with proof I own my facebook acount, twitter, google+, youtube, social security, etc etc, wouldn't you be inclined to believe I'm who I say I am? You could eventually fake an identity, but could you do it on a mass scale?
