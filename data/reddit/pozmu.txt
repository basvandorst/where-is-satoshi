Lets say all big miners cooperate and create 21M cap removed fork.
Then your choices will be:
1. Use the fork secured by millions of dollars of hashing power.
2. Stay with Vanilla - with that much hashing power drop it may be unusable for days/week (no new blocks = no transactions), then except a big drop in difficulty etc.
And if that happens, except even more forks... 
I think it will be in the hands of bitcoin receivers to decide which fork is the right one - and by receivers I mean companies that gets paid in bitcoin e.g. exchanges, payment processors like bitpay etc.

Just use one of bitcoin mining calculators and check it.
With cex.io you can money but by trading GHS, not mining.

It's going to happen in Poland soon in form of "billon"  .
From what I've read there is no fractional reserve requirement = they can create unlimited amount of it. They = banks, I think 2 banks are gonna implement it.
Cool thing is that it will work offline too.
BTW this is happening because there is some EU directive allowing creation of electronic mo ey... Probably more countries will follow this trend.

Because you don't need to use Bitcoin for transaction between trusted parties. They have their own system with 0 fees etc.

That's what capitalism is about.
You don't really think that in XXI century USA things like poverty etc. would exist unless someone can, greatly benefit from them?
I don't think bitcoin would change that.

1. Change ipad/tablet version - right now it displays enlarged mobile version which not only looks hilarious but is also very hard to use. No option to switch to desktop version - sorry, that's all I can see on my ipad :/

There are no more pointed instructions... You have to keep reading bitcointalk/ coins' subreddits/ forum and look for promising altcoins - however most of them are scrypt, last interesting SHA256 altcoin I remember was Huntercoin and it was even merge minable, meaning you could mine it alongside e.g. bitcoin...

Hmmm, there is one thing I can't stop thinking about: do people who bought at $1000+ knew about early adopters that have thousands of bitcoins mined during 2009 when DIFF = 1 or bought for lesst than 1$/BTC?
I think they didn't, they read about decentralization, freedom, fairness  etc. etc.
Now I'm pretty sure most people know about whales, I think market is gonna be reluctant to make this rich people even richer... Unless they invenst they BTC and quit just hoarding it.
