I’ve done this this past week, and setting another up tonight only for fun.
Easy to setup the node, but the lightning management is bizarre.  Keep in mind that you will likely lose money to fees.
If I’ve learned anything from this experience it’s that while fun to experiment with, LN is far..far from user friendly.  You can’t even receive a payment by default - you need to seek out a well connected someone or a service to connect to your node with inbound liquidity.
Also keep in mind that there’s only 3,500 public nodes!  (Seems like a tiny amount for a payment network)

I upped the allocation from the default 60% to 75% to see what happens.  It’s still thrown 60% at 1 pending channel on restart - wonder if it’ll find another for the remaining 15%.
Still being conservative since this is the first time I’ve set one up.  Appreciate the help/input, thanks!

Why would I spend $100 in BTC for groceries when that BTC can easily be worth $115 the next day?  Or a couple hours later?
Conversely, as a business why would I sell something worth $100 for BTC that could be worth $85 the next day?  Or a couple hours later?

Your private key is held by a third party.  General advise is use an exchange for trading only.  Transfer funds to a hw or paper wallet for investing, don’t leave significant funds on an exchange.
@_date: 2019-07-27 16:37:13
I like the idea of a passphrase that I can back up in metal, ie:
I guess my main hangups are A) the private key not being completely in my control, and B) if recovery or access is at all limited by A.
You have a hw wallet I take it?  Which one and what are your likes/dislikes?
Edit: I meant seed phrase, not pass phrase

I agree that relying *only* on memory would be nuts.  It can be a good soft backup, but you still need a hard backup.
Burning any copy and taking care of pressure imprints...I mean it really depends on the relative safety of your environment.  Do you live in a dorm or high traffic common-space environment?  Probably not a terrible idea.  Out in the country where barely anyone notices you?  Eeehhh...
Though remember:  it’s only paranoia if they *aren’t* out to get you... ��

I think I was just looking at logging noise.  I waited a couple hours with no change, so I went ahead and funded the node with $100.
I did note after that getinfo shows synced_to_chain = true, so presumably that’s actually what I should have been checking all along.
It’s successfully connected to 1 channel (autopilot config set to 5 max, why isn’t it seeking out more channels?), so I guess I’m waiting now to see if anything routes through it ��.

Your public key is the address on the chain where your funds lie.  The private key is what allows you to access the funds at that address.
Hardware wallets are just a simplified and more secure means to carry your private and public keys with you.  You could just as well write them down on a piece of paper (albeit much with much less security).

Hypothetically: What happens in the case where Ledger/Trezor are no longer in business in 10 years?
How would I go about recovering funds from a hw wallet if the underlying service/software becomes defunct?
Ie: say I backup the seed phrase on metal, wipe or lose the hw device, and come back 10 years later with just the seed phrase?  (And like I said - say Trezor is out of business.  No hw devices, and no Trezor software/website)

Hm, I’m at about 11.  Sounds like a no then..
@_date: 2019-07-28 02:07:32
Question for you: if you can use a bunch of software wallets to recover the ledger wallet with the seed phrase...isn’t the seed phrase just as valuable as the private key?
At which point..if the goal is cold storage, does the hw actually buy any protection if a “key” is still the seed phrase that isn’t part of the device?

Check out this page and see where you may have gone astray:
Note the parts about using systemctl to enable the config file.  The doc throws in a reboot rather than having you start the daemon manually - so that you can insure it starts up automatically correctly.
If you need to, you can use similar systemctl disable, start, stop, commands as needed.
But the point should be: setup the config, make sure the daemon can run by itself automatically, let it go (unless you need to stop it to upgrade bitcoind etc).

If it’s Linux you should be able to format the ssd as ext4 and download the chain to the ssd from your PC, then use it with the Pi.

“Student loan debt” in the US is proper fucked in general.  We need to massively *encourage* higher learning and critical thinking, not penalize it and saddle people with a decade-long burden of being below the poverty line.
Granted, Trump is the worst human being to have ever existed and we all know this is not altruism on his part.
But why would you begrudge other disabled veterans having said burden lifted?  That’s why you’re angry, right?  Because “you didn’t get yours” and you worked harder?
I can sympathize with how frustrating that would be, and I would be too!  But it’s not “average Joe”’s faultiest that the education system in this country is rotten.  It’s far better to spend taxes on education and have an educated workforce.

That’s what I did.  I had $200 active inbound from lnbig, and was connected to two other lnbig channels as outbound ($100 split between the two).  Couldn’t even receive a 100s tip from the tip bot in this channel - no path to node.
If I missed something stupid I’d be happy to try again - as I said I want it to work - but if it’s this fiddly IMO it didn’t seem ready for prime time.

What the hell is “announced” and where is that visible/discoverable?
All three channels (x2 outbound, x1 inbound) were connected and listed as Active.  Is that what you mean or is there some hidden state you’re talking about?
If I recall after the channels connected I waited overnight and the sent/received sats on all 3 was still 0  in the morning (and receiving the tip failed several times).
Are you saying I need to commit some amount of outbound liquidity and then just “wait a few days”?
What if the channels disconnect in that time?  What am I supposed to do then?  So many questions..

I can try again, though the barrier to entry on establishing an LN node seems even higher than I thought..
I can’t imagine a ton of people interested in running a node will be willing to throw a substantial amount of money into a LN wallet for outbound liquidity, getting inbound, and then waiting a few days before doing anything and maintaining that as an active node.

Investing in your future is a good idea, but don’t go down the hype-hole.  As a 16 year old, you will not make anywhere close to 6 figures.
Do not invest in bitcoin with the hope of “getting rich quick”. 
The bitcoin all-time-high is ~20K.  The current price is roughly 8K.
If you were to put $1,000 in right now, and BTC doubled overnight to 16K, you’d be at $1,000 profit.
For you to reach just $10,000 on your original $1,000, the price would need to reach $80,000.  x4 higher than its ever been. 
The best advice I’ve heard to this day is still: only put into cryptocurrency what you’re willing to lose.

Click “receive” in Ledger Live.  Follow the prompts etc on Ledger Live and on your Device until you verify the receive address.
In Coinbase select Withdraw.  Paste in your copied receive address - make sure it’s correct - and submit the transaction.
Don’t bother adding the receive address to your Coinbase address book.  As has been mentioned, for every withdrawal have Ledger Live create a new receive address for you.

That page is for creating “gift” wallet printouts that are meant to be folded in such a fancy way that that image sits on top of the QR code so that the code isn’t visible through the 2nd piece of paper.
The folded version is supposed to look like [this]( .
That being said, I’ve used this generator and I wouldn’t recommend that you do so - unless it’s for a cheap gift to give someone else.
Edit: if you are set on a paper wallet for yourself - and if memory serves - I believe you might want the “single wallet” tab instead.  Doesn’t have the snazzy art/colors/etc.  Just public, private, done.

If you have to ask this question, you probably already know the answer
@_date: 2019-12-26 20:28:03
So what’s this game
@_date: 2019-12-31 04:13:20
There’s nowhere centralized to store what you’re looking for - which is kinda the point of Bitcoin.  There isn’t going to be a “address X == Tom B.’s Savings” metadata anywhere other than personal preferences in systems like the Coinbase one.
You can look into Bitcoin Vanity Addresses if you desire which is a little similar, but you are strongly discouraged from actually using them.
@_date: 2019-12-31 23:56:16
Think of it like a stock on the stock market - the value of it is determined by what people are willing to pay for it.  Current market price is ~$7,200.
Cryptocurrency markets can fluctuate wildly.  They are only recommended for investing with funds that you’d be willing to lose.
This value could halve or double tomorrow - but it’s almost certainly never going to increase again by the same margin that it did to get the early investors rich.

DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging) is the most popular strategy.  Regularly buy a little, irrespective of market price.  You’ll end up making some purchases low, some high, with the end-goal being an even investment (if not positive).
Don’t try to time the market with one big buy *if* you will kick yourself later when it dips below.  If that won’t bother you, then go for it - up to you.
As to “how much is enough..”, no such thing.  Keep a diverse financial portfolio where crypto is just one asset.  Balance how you see fit as you get older.
@_date: 2019-12-29 02:07:27
Joking aside..
Given your other responses in this thread, I think you should find another vendor that offers more flexibility that you are comfortable with.  I don’t want to discourage you from using BTC, but I don’t want you to feel like you *have to* use it against your will either.
A vendor *only* accepting BTC at this stage in the game is a little strange.  If this is something you are ordering online - you are aware that Bitcoin transactions cannot be reversed, right?
@_date: 2019-12-31 23:19:04
Bitcoin is anonymous.  The white paper has details in the privacy section: 
What level of anonymity are you seeking?
@_date: 2019-12-03 02:52:21
It’s for privacy.  Keep in mind that the addresses are public - that’s the point of the public ledger - so if you’re doing transaction after transaction on the same address it’ll start looking like a bank account.  One that can start to take on spending/saving patterns of your behaviors.
Your seed phrase gives you a functionally (but not actually) infinite number of addresses.  Use them to isolate transactions and increase your privacy so that when people find an interesting address/transaction, it’s harder and harder to link to *you*.

That’s 3/10’s of 1 cent with default fees I believe?  The open channel fees were probably ~200+ each also right?
Like I said, not impossible - but it takes a lot of work, and as you said: time.
I wanted it to work not to make a profit, but to participate in the network and maybe defray cost a *little* bit...but I didn’t even get to contribute to the network (route anything).  Once I heard the new Bitfinex node only did 800 total LN transactions - which I had an open channel with for several hundred $ - I packed it in, again.
I just want people to be serious about what they are getting into before dropping money on SSDs.  That being said, if you *are* going to do it, the stadicus guide(s) does seem to be the best around.

As you said - several people have claimed already.  No one cares, other than to see if they could get some BTC from them.
At this point the only people who would claim the title are people seeking fame.  The “real” Satoshi doesn’t matter, what’s been started does.

Already can.  Link your bank account to Coinbase, purchase BTC.
If you are referring to keeping it all within the bank you use today, why the fuck would you want to do that?

Oh for fucks sake.  There is no vast conspiracy, stop screaming into the wind.

You sell it on an exchange like Coinbase, then withdraw to a bank account as an example.
There are other methods with less KYC, but I don’t have experience with them personally.

There is a real and safe way!  Just not for you (or 99.99% of everyone for that matter).

People still need money to exchange for goods and services.  They hope (as every human does) that they will “get rich” at some point so that they have more money to exchange for goods and services.
Buying a big ticket item like a car or something is stupid.  Cashing out (if someone is so lucky) at some point to retire to a **modest** life would not be.
If you think that’d be hypocritical and people should convert all their fiat for BTC, and live off BTC only as The New World Order from now on - you are free to lead that charge.
In that New World Order though, surprise..you will again be in the poor class with your principles.  While the old rich will again be rich.  
If you can find a means to get ahead that does’t hurt someone and gives you and those you love some peace, take it.
@_date: 2019-12-27 18:55:07
You’re right, but moving into actual “real” currency seems like such a broad escalation for those platforms.  Especially when they have a history of feckless “we’re super duper sorry” non-apologies where nothing really changes.

You can check out the [stadicus]( guide for an example, which configures bitcoin core on a raspberry pi with external SSD.  That linked page will cover formatting and setting owning user, and the bitcoin section covers configuring the daemon to write to the ext drive.

You should encourage them to get over their fear.  Join the exchange, buy some BTC, send it to a HW wallet, and unlink their financial info from the exchange if they’re really paranoid.
Use an exchange just as an on-ramp/off-ramp only.  Keep your own keys, and your wealth stays in your hands.

In 2010 1 BTC was about $0.50.  Early investors saw promise and/or a gamble, and bought a lot.  Say 1000 BTC for $500.
The recent ATH for BTC was ~$20,000.
If that same person that bought that theoretical 1000 BTC back then sold at the ATH, they would have sold for $20,000,000.

Bad monkey!  No!  Stop punching yourself in the dick!
Everything you are doing is wrong right now.  It seems like you are trying to get rich quick.  If so, Bitcoin is not for you.
If you are trying to invest, take some time to learn about proper investment and money management strategies.  Paying one credit card off with another credit card to try to game something is *never one of those strategies*.

On Coinbase as just one example, you can add a nickname to an address that you send currency to for ease of use later.  This is stored on Coinbase’s end though.  I’m sure they are not the only ones that offer an address book type of functionality.

Use a PC, configure bitcoin core (ex: windows PC) to use your max PC memory -3GB and sync to a removable SSD.
After 1-2 day sync, move the SSD over to your Pi and mount the exFAT drive with exFAT-Utils.
Copy the chainstate and block files to your Pi SSD.  Configure the bitcoin core on the Pi to use that location for sync.
