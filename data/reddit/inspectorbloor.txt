Yeah that would violate the non-aggression principle.....but nice try though

If it's any consolation/reassurance, I actually know the guy doing this.  He's a stand-up, trustworthy fellow if I've ever met one.
Edit: Hey Jake!  I was going to post a link to the indiegogo page here but you beat me to it!

Companies like Bitpay are setting up merchant accounts that cash out the BTC you receive as payment immediately, and the next day the cash will be available in your account, so any big swings are a fairly moot point.

silver is a far more useful metal anyway :)

It's easy to "track" the transactions yes, actually pinning a BTC address down to a particular individual is an entirely different ballgame I would think.

A disincentive?  It costs us 2% to run a credit card, it costs 1.6% to take Bitcoin.  It's a no brainer.  Granted that fee may change someday, but for the moment it's no risk to us.
But yes you are absolutely correct, we are not at risk, but BitPay *sure as shit is*.

Add in things like Silk Road and Black Market Reloaded and prohibition becomes an absolute joke

I work at a bullion shop, we just started accepting BTC yesterday :)  First in our area by a long shot.

Hasn't been a problem!  No one has come in to redeem any yet :P
But, it shouldn't be an issue, at least not in the near future.  The way it is set up is through bitpay, they take the coins and cash them out as soon as the transaction is confirmed if we so choose.  For a 1.6% fee which is less than our credit card machine costs us per swipe.
I need to play around with the system to see if it's working properly though.  I've been too preoccupied with other dealings (as I'm sure we all have been) for the last day or two now, haven't had much time to play with our fledgling exchange service.

Bought 2 Casascius coins back in August 2012 for 15 a piece.  Not only have they increased more than 17 fold at the moment.  But the particular mintage of coins I got seem to be somewhat collectable.  Even better, they are a misprint that sells on eBay for 700-1000 bucks apiece.
Should have bought a **goddamned roll** when I had the chance.

The only way to support any sort of a **non-voluntary** taxation system, is through threat of violence, and in the end, actual violence.
And frankly, that whomps.
