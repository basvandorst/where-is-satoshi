If you want Bitcoin to succeed you need to come up with a way to make it easy as shitting for the public to use it. Otherwise it is just another payment processor. This constant motivational circle-jerk won't magically raise the price to any celestial body.

No word about the behaviour of the customer service? No word about why I wasn't notified?
But, of course I'm accepting bitcoin.de not wanting to accept PayCenter customers. That's why I switched to Coinbase.
But I'm going to tell everyone I know how shitty the lying customer service on bitcoin.de is. And then I'm going to help them buy or sell bitcoin on any other website.
So, fuck you, too, I guess!

@_date: 2015-07-08 08:59:00
PayCenter still requires you to fully authorize yourself. They're not doing anything illegal or even things in grey areas. You need a seizure protected account if you're declaring (private) bankruptcy. And they give accounts to almost anyone because they're not doing credit checks. Like I said before and just like Fidor does!
If Bitcoin.de wasn't partnered with Fidor it should/would probably block Fidor, too. Your link has several people looking actively for new Fidor and PayCenter accounts for scamming.
And even then I still got 3 different bullshit "explanations" from their "support team" AND I was never informed about the dis-continued support for PayCenter. I wanted to buy more bitcoin and was left wondering why I had to enter a new bank account. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 20:20:52

What are they playing when the price goes down? Because that's what is going to happen next...
@_date: 2015-07-07 16:08:23
Here is why bitcoin.de has lost my business:
I talked with their customer service about why they deleted the link to my PayCenter account (the linking is necessary to buy and sell bitcoin over that specific bank account, since everything is p2p on bitcoin).
First they told me it wasn't technically possible, which was news too me, because I had bought ~33 bitcoin through ~40 transactions at that point over that exact account.
Then they told me the interface of PayCenter changed and it wasn't compatible with theirs anymore. That was just plain bullshit, since the interface between bitcoin.de and PayCenter is me typing in different numbers for every transaction. And I still have both hands.
Then they told me there was a possibility that PayCenter bank accounts can be hacked while making transactions over bitcoin.de. That didn't made sense either, since to bitcoin.de every bank account is the same and it would be bitcoin.de that had a security breach.
I forwarded the whole email chain to PayCenter and they were just as confused as I was and told me there was no known security breach.
I forwarded that back to bitcoin.de and haven't heard since from then.
Now the interesting thing is their special partnership with Fidor Bank. They enable express buying/selling through Fidor Bank and make a point to push every customer to Fidor. And since Fidor accounts are so-called "Guthabenkonten" (you can only spend what you first wire to them; there is no negative balance possible) there is no need for credit checks, if you want to open an account with Fidor.
PayCenter has the same "business model" and is therefore a direct competitor. And that's the only reason PayCenter isn't allowed anymore on bitcoin.de, which fucking sucks.

Are you kidding me?! This has written bullshit all over it. It is obviously just a scam to suck some money out of gullible fools.

I'm using 'bitcoin wallet' on my mobile phone for impulse buys. I never have more than ~100€ in there.
At home I have the electrum client on my normal windows 7 installation with an encrypted wallet (through electrum) and I have memorized and never written down the seed for it. Here is where I store all other bitcoins I get.
Is that secure enough?

As a german I don't see why Ersatz has a negative connotation. Is it really used that way in english? As a inferior substitute? The original german meaning is being an equal substitute.

You should rather invest (spent...) *with* Bitcoin in smaller businesses. That is IMHO what would be best for everyone.

Quick Translation: 
Was is "Bitcoin" and what is the meaning of the name?
It is a currency, that uses neither banknotes nor coins. Is consists of computated, encrypted data blocks. The name is a portmanteau of "Bit" (the smallest data unit for computers) and "coins".
Since how long have Bitcoin been around?
The concept has been introduced in 2008 by an internet user under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto" in an internet forum. The bitcoin network was created on the 3rd of January 2009 by calculating the first 50 bitcoin blocks.
How can I get bitcoins?
Bitcoins can either be bought for conventional currency on bitcoin exchanges or by offering goods and services for bitcoins.
There are free apps for PC's and mobile phones - so called "bitcoin wallets". You can store your Bitcoins in those wallets, and also use them to send and receive Bitcoins. If you want to pay with bitcoins on the go, you'll have to take your bitcoin wallet with you (mobile phone, notebook) or you can have the amount deducted over the internet.
Who is creating bitcoins?
Computers are creating the currency through complicated formulas that include strong encryption - this is called "mining". A usual PC would need several month for the calculation of a small amount of bitcoins. Because of that, multiple computers are connected together to a network, to be able to mine more bitcoins in a shorter time. Bitcoin mining isn't worth it for ordinary users, since the power costs are higher than the value of the generated bitcoins.
A centrally managing bank or a state department doesn't exist, only a "Bitcoin Foundation", who is further developing the technology behind the money.

For 4 years the bitcoin account of a student was sleeping - it ended in a fantastic surprise.
ONLY FOR CRIMINALS? The fear of virtual money is growing
How is Bitcoin-Money "send"?
If you want to send bitcoins, you'll need the address of the receiver and one or more transfer agents. Every agent gets a small fee for his service. The more intermediaries approve the transfer, the more save it gets. After a completed transfer there is no way back - accidental transfers can not be canceled.
How much are bitcoins worth?
At the beginning the cyber currency wasn't getting any trust and was just worth only a few cents. But after rising demand as a payment form, the value was rising on the bitcoin exchanges: Currently (as of 11.13.2013) one bitcoin is worth about 260 € through free trade.
Where can I buy bitcoins?
The first product that had been bought for bitcoins were pizzas and Alpaka socks: There is now also an ATM in Vancouver (Kanada) which can be used to trade bitcoins into hard currency. But the cyber currency is still far away from a widespread acceptance - only a few online shops are accepting the currency.
What are the pro's and con's of Bitocins?
The data money is not only widely forgery proof, it also protects the anonymity of its users. Since no state and no bank is controlling the computer money, the value can not be artificially manipulated. The value depends only on the laws of the market economy.
But there are resulting disadvantages: There is no institution that guarantees a value stability. And consumers without a computer can't even use the currency. Additionally, criminal elements can take advantage of the anonymity in dubious dealings.
Is Bitcoin going to replace the currencies of the world?
The cyber currency is far from a competition for the Euro. Bitcoins aren't going to replace banknotes and coins anytime soon.
But who knows: Maybe the banknotes of the future are going to become small "Bitcoin Computers" themselves?
Keep in mind that the 'Bild' is germanys opinion factory for the dumb. It 'BuILDs" the opinion of the masses. Most know it is vile and manipulating and not worth to be read. But it does get read anyway by a fucking lot of people who aren't thinking for themselves and suck in the opinion of this shit stained collection of words and pictures. /rant
This article could have been informative but instead it went back to the old fear mongering, for which the Bild is known...

Regarding the notion of bitcoin as a world currency: Isn't it possible that all the wallet addresses get used up at some point? Or is that expandable?
I know there is a gigantic amount of addresses, but still, if everyone uses it for the next 1000 years and human population still grows exponentially...
What about attacks that target exactly this? Can the bitcoin protocol just be changed to allow for more addresses?
And what about the crypto-part of it being a crypto-currency. Say that part gets cracked. Can it be changed in the protocol?

Good evening Reddit community, my name is Steve Hufmann. As some of you already know, I am the co-founder of Reddit.
Firstly, I must apologize for the increased site downtime this week; there has been a heavy load on the servers since the Bitcoin mania has taken over the media. And of course the database rollback. There is a reason for this: many new features are being implemented on the site and will be revealed in due course.
We are now also ready to offer a very unique opportunity to a lucky few: the chance to invest in the site! That's right. It is truly a defining moment. I must be very clear and say that this is investment only, you will not own or have a say in any part of the running or management of Reddit. Please do not speak about this on the bitcoin sub-Reddit just yet as we are anticipating a lot of media attention over this and would like to minimize the impact if possible.
We are offering 300 investment shares of 0.1 percent of the income of the site (income excludes running costs &amp; management's share, staff etc.) which currently stands at ~$200'000 per month or $2'400'000 annually. Shares will be priced at $400 for a 0.1% share, paid in BTC (see below) at Mt. Gox's weighted average at that time. There is no limit on the amount of shares you can buy, and the amount we will be paying out equates to 25% of the sites income.
There is no limit to the amount of shares any one person can buy. For a 0.1% investment you will earn $200 per month, for a 0.5% investment you will earn $1000 a month and so on. As the site grows so will your pay-out, investments can be withdrawn at any time and pay-outs will be paid at the next pay-out date up to that point. This is a very unique opportunity and a chance to be a part of history. To our knowledge, we will be the FIRST company/website/blog to offer shares in Bitcoin.
Money invested is going to be used in the short-term to finance more servers and to cover more staff to enable us to make Reddit faster and better than ever before, with more staff to assist you and more features for you to make your experience that much better. Investors will have a new area within the site where they can see the amount they have invested, the next pay-out date, and the amount which will be updated hourly. You will also find options here to change pay-out schedule (weekly, monthly, annually), cancel investment &amp; change view types. We are done beta testing how the new layout will look.
Pay-outs will by default be paid monthly into a BTC wallet address that you will supply us; the schedule can be changed to weekly and a wallet address can be specified for payments. If you decide to cancel your investment, it will be refunded immediately.
Payment for your shares need to be paid to the address specified below, these are then tracked internally and after payment for 300 investments has been received the payment address will no longer be valid and payments will not be able to be made into it.
Payment address - 1K9n6GhReaBWqdBttUYMs3rka9Pj5L8RRd
If you receive an invalid wallet address error, you are too late.
Once you have opted into your shares, please reply to this message with 1) Your contact e-mail address 2) The Bitcoin wallet address you have opted in from (by default this will be where payouts are sent)
Your new investors section will become active 8-10 hours after payment is received. You can speed up this process by messaging the Reddit Support here  with your Reddit User name &amp; Amount of investment shares and total BTC sent.
Subject - Reddit Investment Op JohDoe [Your User name goes here instead] 4 x 0.1 BTC 14.1024
This is strictly first come, first served. As mentioned before there is no limit on how many one person can buy. Again, this is the chance to be a part of the site and a part of history.
Thank you and good luck!
Steve Co-Founder Reddit
