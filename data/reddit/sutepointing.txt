That is really weird. So someone hacked another account, then used it to harass you specifically about this. Wonder if connected.

I don't like this guy but man he could bring even more people to Bitcoin.

Throw in that expensive house being converted to fiat and that dumping for "bitcoin 2.0" and you've got a situation where people panic and sell.

Can we get someone to sponsor this idea like right now?!
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:36:03
Isn't that kind of exactly what did? He asked for a story and the first response immediately was no motherfucker, pay for it.
I may give this a go though. You have to see the issue here. Like if nothing else it is confusing and you should stop it.

And now he is going to accept it. lol

Was just curious about this as well.

STOP PROMOTING SITES THAT ARE PROMOTING THE PAYCOIN SCAM

In case they delete it: [Imgur](

Perhaps we should do that on this thread.
I'm looking through my bookmarks... it isn't looking good.

They did report the whole BFL court orders that were secret and sealed and even posted picture of them on reddit before they were even public.
I am inclined to believe they have VERY serious connections.

You just gained a new customer the moment I have the need to dump some alt coins with this move. Nice work.
@_date: 2015-01-03 06:26:13
Thanks for making this list. GoCoin should be everyone's next target.

The mind-blowing thing for me is that each time Mike publishes these bombshell documents they are true.... and that is mind-blowing to me because any other journalist publishing these sort of documents in advance would be frisked a thousand times over, have email probed and likely a site being shut down or at least the leaked stuff taken down.
Yet somehow, this stuff always remains... not just because it is true but because someone doesn't want the leaks stopped. That says something.
Mike, who do you really work for?
