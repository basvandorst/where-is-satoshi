I sold my remaining BTC today, partially because the uncertainty outweighed the risk of the extra $80 I might get back if BTC returns to it's pre-drop levels (I'm down to my last coin, and I actually need the money in the next 2 months or so). I had around 7 BTC, the majority of which I bought around $250, and have been slowly selling it off the past several months to fund my summer in Europe. I fully expect to get back in when I get back into work mode. I'm equally impressed with the communities reaction today versus Mt.Gox with my selling being more coincidental than through a lack of faith. If I had 10K, I'd be watching this dip as an opportunity, but I don't. I'm surprised BTC only dropped a piddly 10%. BTC is still up 90% YTD. Short term, I just don't see BTC flying up to $800 in the next month, so I will happily continue to enjoy my gains.

Not as bad as holding significant savings in bitcoin and the price going down another 50%, which is entirely possible.

If I knew lots of things about tomorrow's financial markets, I'd probably be looking for a way to spend my millions instead of being here on Reddit.

Is there sufficient evidence to accuse Coinbase? You must be as curious as the rest of us, and since you didn't do anything wrong, why not talk to them? There is an entire subreddit dedicated to transacting safely on DNMs, and considering you purchased directly from Coinbase wallet, it's safe to assume you're not familiar with all the precautions.

Yes, through an argentine friend of mine. Most foreigners who don't live here full-time, are not signing a contract, nor have a garantia (some argentines don't, or are unwilling either). Like I said, I signed a 2 year contract, and paid 4 months up front in lieu of the garantia, for an unfurnished place, which is common. The moment you get something that is month-to-month and furnished in Palermo, the assumption is you're a foreigner and you have dollars, and you pay 3 times as much. A place for more than 5000p a month barely exists outside of Palermo/Recoleta/PM/Belgrano because they're not "desirable" barrios to foreigners.

Living in Buenos Aires has taught me a hell of a lot more than my minor in Economics.

If it wouldn't be too much trouble, would you mind PM'ing their contact info?

3300p a month. I'm not argentine, and couldn't get a garantia (but had to pay 4 months rent upfront in lieu). Not shared. 2 year contract. I'm aware, my place is an awesome deal, but a friend of mine also just got her own one bedroom place for 5000p a month ($400USD), no garantia, no contract, in SOHO. It has 4 stories, including terrace and small office, with a huge living room. There are deals to be had still in Palermo, you just gotta be smart (unlike SF or NYC).

What are you living in a Puerto Madero penthouse flushing money down your toilet? I pay $250USD for my one bedroom in Palermo SOHO, taxi across town is $5, steak dinner with and nice bottle of wine, about $15, bus is $0.25, Electric bill about $7 a month, gas is $2. Argentina is cheap as hell if you're not a tourist or too lazy to do some basic research. A lot cheaper than Chile and Uruguay. Yes, these are all based on dolar blue prices, which is the true exchange rate.

I get that. What are the benefits of this? Is it simply a means of archiving, permanently, important documents?

Yes and no. A bitcoin is worth around 50% less today than it was a year ago, whereas the peso would be something like 30-40%. As soon as BTC finds it's bottom, holding pesos simply would not make sense, especially when there are tons of emerging means of buying BTC with pesos (below market rate too).

I agree, but that could defeat the purpose of the Vault unless they made a minimum time frame. If your account is compromised, the hacker would presumably have access to the security period setting.

"If you flip a coin, there's a great chance you'll get heads.... There's an equal chance, however, that you will get tails, but our technical analysis has shown that flipping heads twice in a row has happened in the past, though it may not this time."

Also makes tax declaration to IRS a lot easier when it's lumped into the rest of your brokerage activity. I declare all my stocks profit/loss with 1099-B, but don't bother declaring my bitcoin activity to IRS because honestly, I don't know, nor care to learn how, but you can see how this could be a problem for people who are at risk of an audit (I'm not, and it's a risk I choose to take).
