What's your doubts about the topic, nor about your preferred food.
However I see that the argument is concluded, so later.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:15:51
As I said: the surviving chain will the coin everyone will use, there won't be any other chain to consider at all.
If one of the chains will adopt a replay protection, it will be the minority chain and the other the main chain.
What's your doubts?
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:26:08
It's actually very easy:
The original chain will be the one that will not have any replay protection (it will survive because of consensus).
If both chain will not have a replay protection, only one will survive (the one with most consensus).

How this is related with the title of the thread? That's another question, you may want to open a new thread.

Bitcoin protocol is slow, there's no other solution than using a second layer or radically modify the protocol (don't even mention 0-conf that isn't onchain either and it's exploitable).
Hence LN is the only solution and it works, is it perfect? Nope, but it can be perfected.
That's sure is that the block cannot increase forever to cope the worldwide demand, so that would NEVER be the solution.

If someone mine at loss, it has a purpose: trying to profit soon after. This is crypto-currency world, they aren't philanthropists. But they failed.


We don't have just 3 chains... we have the Bitcoin and tens of forks (BTG.. BCD.. whatever) that are alt-coins that none is using and none will ever use if not for speculation.


It's because the tiny market capitalization: you can manipulate the price of every coin beyond Ripple with private money. You can do that with bcash, bsv.. and every other alt-coin out there.
Also, the price will never go to zero, because of lost wallets... and it'll go sub-30 and it'll die/sit there.
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:38:32
The correct title should be: 61% of Bitcoin holders can sell *individually* gaining a profit.
Because if 61% of Bitcoin holders will all sell together... well I don't even have to explain the consequence to the price. :)
@_date: 2019-11-30 22:59:04
So confirming it's a scam.. isn't enough for you? :D
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:27:12
I see your point but I don't agree, it's a shitcoin that should be forgotten. Pinning anything you're giving visibility to a scammer.
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:24:15
"forever" was rhetorical, if the guy was caught to have a unconfirmed transaction for hours because of the fees, that you can speed up by paying higher fees, on the bcash chain you can have a unconfirmed transaction stuck for even longer no matter what fees you gonna pay, because it's not that your transaction isn't gonna be mined in the next block, but because **there will be no next block at all!**
That's a better explanation for you? :)
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:42:09
There's people earning big bucks, but those ones who are selling their methods are a bunch of scammers (like those ones who sell their methods to win at the lottery.. lol).
It's really not that hard to have profit while trading in cryptos, it's easy as it was in the past with the stock market (crypto market isn't regulated yet), just don't those gurus (especially the paid ones), get documented, understand the market reaction (on news), read the signals, anticipate the movements.
The point is: get educated, don't try to find a shortcut to be millionaire.
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:36:45
"bcash" is a short term to say "bitcoin cash", even RV was using it the fork days! It turned to be a "bad word" because someone realized that "bcash" doesn't contain the word "Bitcoin", so they couldn't scam ppl efficiently. RV and his staff doesn't even like it to be called "BCH", for the same reason.
bcash mk.cap is thin air (pretty like BSV), the price has been sustained by who financed its launch (Bitmain), there's really no real activity on it, it's all financial speculation and when the toy will break, it'll be forgotten like hundreds alt-coins before it. There's no future for the bcash.
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:32:42
Look the bcash story can be resumed in few words: RV, Faketoshi and CA tried to get the Bitcoin ownership with the money of the China gov puppet (Jihan) and failed big, the whole ship sink, they started to fight internally and split. Here we're today, with two new alt-coins that have a virtual value, a mere number, that is gonna be valued ZERO soon.
Feel free to play with bcash as speculator, anyone trying to hodl it will wake up one day with nothing in their hands.
@_date: 2019-11-29 21:25:37
bcash have changed the adjusting difficulty algorithm creating two unwanted effects: the first is about every fork living no matter what's the hash rate (so you can actually fork from bcash even with a single node and the minority chain will survive, no matter what's the hash rate); the second is about the difficulty changing so rapidly that you can move a considerable amount of hash power aboard of it (remember: the hash rate is shared with Bitcoin that actually own 97% of it, so it's easy to gain the control of the majority of it) and subtract it right after, creating a discrepancy of several hours in block producing with the consequence of: the malicious miner mining tens of blocks within a short amount of time, and the (potential) users suffering the block mining delay of several hours when the hash power is moved away.
That's the bcash situation today and how insecure it is that chain, it also proven how their devs are introducing radical changes to the original Bitcoin protocol without thinking at the consequences (there's a reason of why Satoshi designed the DAA like it is today).
@_date: 2019-11-30 13:32:34
The redundancy is due to the fact that whenever it'll be needed, no matter about LN, Bitcoin will increase the block size (the narrative that it'll never be increased is a stupidity invented by RV and his minions to justify the creation of his chinese-fake-coin), as of today there's no need to have bigger blocks, they are optimized for today's usage (BCH blocks are basically empty).
So bcash can be wiped any day, and I'm not even mentioning that since the hash power is shared, it can be attacked anytime by small miners with little effort.
So again, these aren't opinions but facts: bcash and bsv have no future, they are just (failed) attempts to create money from thin air, they cannot sustain the price forever, they will fall and be forgotten.
@_date: 2019-11-30 21:53:08


There will be no more circulation and the price will freeze. Sub 30 is the predicted value (but it can really be $20000000000, it doesn't matter as the last transaction will determine the value when it'll die).


Every Bitcoin fork is irrelevant.


None is using these chains, there's no such "microtransactions", it's RV and Faketoshi bouncing money between wallets.
I understand that you may be involved in this bcash scam, but this isn't really the sub where you can promote it. ;)
@_date: 2019-11-30 15:40:37
They are squeezing it for "free" money, it'll be killed when it will not serve the speculation anymore.
Hard forks are done when they are needed, there's no need as of today.
bcash has been financed by Bitmain to get their hand on the Bitcoin (hoping to be the main chain after the fork): producing the mining hardware while controlling the chain would have been their dirty dream, RV and Faketoshi were the frontmen, when their project failed they split again. Who do you think was mining it at loss right after the split (when the DAA was gamed), a crazy miner or someone who had his hands "invested" in the chinese version of the Bitcoin? :)
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:46:24
There's so much amount of hash power that you can attack the bcash chain anytime... it hasn't been done yet (so far) because there's very little (or nothing) to earn. Ppl having money sitting on it must be crazy.
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:26:47
I had 20 BTC on Kraken and got 20 BCH, I was unable to do anything yesterday because Kraken was crashing on me, and I got mad coz I wanted those $230 * 20 free.. and that was the lucky unexpcted shoot, because I sold them all for $690 today, after have set a stop loss below $700 (they gone well above it), for almost $14,000 completely "free".
On the other side now I have another 22 BTC on Trezor, I managed to convert them to BCH yesterday noon, then they disabled the wallet... not a big issue coz I couldn't transfer it anyway. Knowing it before I would have transferred them on Kraken as well.. but I consider myself lucky to have earned a such unexpected amount of money doing basically nothing!
Now the difficulty decision is if to add more BTC with those spare money or cash the plus out and take 1 month Holiday in some tropical place.. :D 
@_date: 2019-11-29 20:36:13
I see someone suggested to you to use bcash next time. What he didn't told ya, is that if this happened because of fees (and can be avoided), in the bcash chain, due to the DAA manipulation (because of the very low mining hash power), your transaction can be stuck forever independently by the fee you're going to pay.
@_date: 2019-11-29 19:31:58
He's a scammer, he scammed in the past, he's scamming now, he will scam in the future after his bcash fakecoin will fail (nor that it didn't failed already, considering that it lost 96% of its value already).
He's doing it for his own interest (money...), so while blaming a fraudster (Faketoshi is another example), you should also blame those (hopefully few) who doesn't remember the history.
That guy, with what he did with MtGox should have been banned from the crypto-sphere, but instead he still scamming people by have overtaken the Bitcoin ticker on Reddit, taken the bitcoin dot com domain and (until some weeks ago) f*ed with the Twitter account named "Bitcoin".. all to catch more noobs in his net, even his wallet software is scam (by renaming Bitcoin to fool ppl to buy the wrong thing).
And that echo chamber named r/btc ...? He claim to be "uncensored", that's not true, he's banning all the critic voices (see my post history as an example...) and all the ppl posting there now are: alt accounts (RV and his PAID staff).
I'm surprised that there's still people giving him any credibility...
@_date: 2017-08-04 13:40:28
I created two accounts within 2 minutes, it doesn't require any confirmation and I had a limit of $5000 on each.
Trasferred my BCH there in two tranches, it took 35 minutes (only 2 confirmations).
Sold them all immediately... they wasn't at $700 anymore but $430 (damn TREZOR and their "fixing whatever they was fixing") for BTC.
Then I transferred the BTC's to Kraken (6 confirmations).
Everything took around 50 minutes, I lost around 2% with all the fees I believe, but hey it was "free" money.

bcash (and BSV) is redundant (because of Bitcoin), none is using these coins, it only exist (as of today) due to speculation, it's destined to disappear. This is not politics, it is a fact.
@_date: 2019-11-30 00:25:48
It's not profitable for whoever has the hash power invested in the mining to attack it. The point is: how you can have your money sitting on a bomb that can explode anytime? That is the reason of why it will never grow beyond this, then money you have aboard of it today it's about the early investor (RV and friends) and few naive users, the earlier investors already lost 96% of their capital, there's nothing much more nothing much left to lose, the movements you see it's about the speculators, like any other alt-coin, or do you think that any of the coin listed on coinmarketcapital.com has a future?
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:27:29
They are really desperate, they are starting to ban non-shilling people with crazy motivation trying to stop the bleeding (I remember when they claimed our sub is not "censored"). In example I got banned for "promoting scam" when I told em that a crypto-currency called "Bitcoin Core" actually exist and it's a shitcoin with the ticker BTCC. They couldn't find a better excuse to ban me. So pathetic that's actually laughable. :Dz
- Proof: 
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:06:39
Bitcoin Core isn't the development team, it's a software implementation. A software implementation cannot push for an "idea". Also LN is welcomed by the Bitcoin users nor by whatever dev.
Returning to the naming, calling the Bitcoin "Bitcoin Core" is like calling the BCH, "Bitcoin Gold"... they are two different coins, it doesn't make sense; or if you refer to the software implementation, it's like calling the BCH, "Bitcoin ABC"... that doesn't make sense as well, for what reason you should use a different name that isn't the recognized and worldwide used and adopted currency name? Abbreviations can be understandable (to shorten a term) but adding arbitrary names makes no sense (unless you want to troll).
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:56:12
Bitcoin Core (BTCC) is a different crypto-currency:

And it doesn't uses LN of course. You're confused with the Bitcoin (BTC).

I bought (very) low, and I cashed out the money I invested initially, to be sure I wouldn't lose money, no matter what; and some other (&lt;10% of the total) for "toys" (I mean if you earn money and you don't use them to have fun.. what's the purpose of them?).
I plan to continue like this: I will cash out a "small" portions time to time (depending of the current price) to enjoy my life, while leaving the rest going to the moon (hopefully).
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:37:47
The market capital still relatively "low"... so some sort of market manipulation by a big player (or a group of them) is possible.
The real issue is another: if it's possible (on a certain level) with the Bitcoin, it's proportionally easier to manypulate every other alt coin with a much lower mkcpt.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:08:48
A correction time to time is desirable because it helps to alleviate the pressure on the coin, to avoid that a bull run turns into a bubble: it cleans the panic, filtering the selling and distributing them across a longer time span. Because a 10% correction doesn't generate panic, while an accumulated pressure that end to a -50% could scare much more people, even those who are accustomed to the Bitcoin volatility and it could trigger a panic sales cycle.
A correction after a huge spike is a GOOD thing, stay calm, hold and wait for the raise to continue.
@_date: 2017-11-15 22:34:41
No, I never created a thread there.. and all my replies weren't "trolling" or "spamming" or shitpost (whenever I don't exactly talk good about the BCH)... until now. I just created my first thread asking if that's their idea of "freedom".

Maybe you didn't read my previous messages. That's exactly what it's being done. No rush to extreme solutions causing more trouble like it's happening with the other shit-forks (see bcash being games with his faulty DAA and bsv uncapable of handling giant blocks).
There's no need for bigger blocks as of today, it'll be done when it'll be time.
@_date: 2019-12-01 16:20:41
You are confusing the tech with someone chancing the crypto-currencies names to scam people.
The Bitcoin chain has both users and miners consensus, it's not just Blockstream, that's why it is called Bitcoin and the chinese fake coin is called bcash.
@_date: 2019-12-03 19:26:33
The biggest advantage of the USDT is about the fact that is a stable-coin. While you're transferring money what you NOT want is the fiat value to change (well, unless you're arbitraging.. but that's another matter). No matter if the transfer is "fast", there will be always the processing time, and moving big chunk of money discovering that they changed their value on the other side, it's not good.
The scenario will be different when the Bitcoin will substitute the current money, but that's not around the corner yet.

You need Bitcoins to fuel LN, it's not a token or different crypto, it is a layer, so whenever LN is adopted, Bitcoin is automatically adopted too.
LN is the only *secure* and working solution to the intrinsically slowness of the protocol (the scalability is another matter) as of today, without revolutionizing the protocol (but at that point you better use another crypto-currency).
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:05:56


I have been banned for that because they didn't had valid reason to ban me. I was debunking their narrative with facts, they couldn't cope, I was exposing their scam, and so they "silenced" me. I'm not alone, they did the same with every other critic user. The "fun" part is that they are accusing this sub of censoring, while it's them applying the censorship.

LN is intimidating to use as Bitcoin was in the past years. Balancing the black size with the *real* demand is the seriousness of the Bitcoin development VS those fake coins alt there that are shredding the original protocol with improvisations.
The block size will be increased? Eventually, if it'll be needed, today it's not.

Exactly. That's what I said.
However with Bitcoin isn't just a matter of compatibility... there's a philosophy behind it, changing the fundamentals is like creating a new coin (and we already have thousands alt-coins). So, while the email will remain email, the Bitcoin departing from its foundation will not be Bitcoin anymore (as example its forks with broken DAA and such).

@_date: 2019-12-02 15:36:09
The mkcap growtch exponentially in the recent years, the cryptos have reached a much wide audience, and these ppl rather care about their money (investment) rather than the usage.. and you can't do anything about it, it's expected.
The other posts aren't gone, but are now mixed between a lambo and another, so less noticeable.

The suppression of opposition is a narrative of bcashers. We're talking here with no suppression, while I HAVE BEEN BANNED from the bcash sub controlled by scammer ver (btc). If there's anyone suppressing anything, is roger scammer silencing those ones who are exposing his scam, so the noobs that will land there will only read his propaganda.
If there's anyone banned here is about trolls, alt-accounts and RV minions and it is a GOOD thing.
RV his paid minions are a band of fraudsters and the chinese bcash is their instrument to scam.
Look at my post history and check about my ban.. oh I'll save you some time, here's: 
I have been banned because I invited them to stop calling Bitcoin with the wrong name that is belong to a scam-coin (BTCC).

I don't know who (and why) those forks happened, but the article is inaccurate because it wasn't the first fork and should be adjusted, unfortunately I don't have a wikipedia account and I don't want to create one just for this purpose (neither I know if you can edit an article with a fresh account).
