Thanks, I'll definitely check that out tomorrow. Not a fan of off-chain/2nd layer solutions. They always sacrifice decentralisation for speed. Which in my opinion is no gain. Not a big fan of LN. Especially after that guy lost 4btc while trying so hard to make it work. Anyway thanks for the link again ��

I still would love to see an intelligent comment with valid argumentations about how btc is a good store of value. To be so the asset has to grow slowly and naturally with +1/2% monthly. And fluctuate by a few %. Btc grew 5x in less than a year and lost half of its value in few months. Even the worst currency in the world (Zimbabwe) is more stable and loses less value against the usd. How would you guys explain that?

I appreciate your answer and agree on many points. By improvements I mean on scalability and similar.notnprivacy and all the useless geek gadgets. Solving the Blockchain trilemma means creating a Blockchain that is secure decentralised and can scale without compromising the first 2 parameters. We have undoubtedly the first 2 on bitcoin. So far it's the most secure and decentralised coin, but can it scale? It looks to me that this issue isn't addressed properly at the point it is purposely kept lagging behind for some reason. I can't believe with all the money surrounding bitcoin for so long, there's not still a guy who can create a solution for it to scale. It's mind blowing to me.

The biggest issue is that people keep their coins on damn exchanges which manipulate the prices. As long as people don't buy cold wallets we will live in this crap pump and dump scheme forever

I understand this and agree, but how's bitcoin a better store of value than monero let's say. They have fallen the same and monero is even more stable although I dislike it . My point is you can't call a coin store of value just because it's the most popular. And just say it's early stage. At this point if no improvements are made and we just use the early stage excuse btc will stagnate and get overtaken.

It doesn't mean anything. You can't just call an asset a store of value for the sake of calling it. For instance a stablecoin like DAI would have a better saying in being called store of value than bitcoin itself.

True. I didn't buy because 99% of the time was peer to peer (money for coin) with somebody from the other side of the world you had never seen. The majority of the time he escaped with the cash. Without giving anything back. That's what you got at the beginning on bitcoin forums.

Still it's the best centralised exchange out there. 
Although the volume is low af and fake. It's full of bots putting and removing orders from the list, in order to make it look like something is happening. But if you try to put an order it will get triggered after hours, unless you pay the taker fee.

True that. Btc is a medium-long term store of value. I'm against the big fluctuations and the market speculation. Not the rest buddy. I clearly explained in my post before, but I partially agree with what you said.

I know yours is a joke but didn't you know that criminals were the pioneers in adopting technology throughout history. When the cars were a new thing, a criminal organisation in France was already using one to escape from the police which at that time was riding a horse xD.
Same now. Criminals use block chain to move funds. Retards use banks

Said by CZ doesn't make much sense. I thought he was talking about himself. Mr pump and dump.

So Microsoft is developing a layer 2  for digital identities yet it backs bakkt which doesn't have  physical bitcoins contracts. Hmmm makes sense. Right?

Don't wait too much. This price is good

People so frustrated and unrealistic. You're late to the party guys. Where do you think btc can go from here? 1billion? Lol
The world economy is around 70Trillions usd.
Imagine hypothetically a 50T market cap for btc. That would be what 250x ? That's if btc can scale and be used for each transaction in daily life, something like 1M transactions daily, from coffees to real estate and so on. Not to mention the rest of the market would get bigger and bigger. We are far from that and if that happens it would be miraculous. Btc could hit 1M for sure in the next cycle. 40x seems plausible if it becomes real store of value and people stick to their keys on cold wallets, so there's lack of supply and high demand. Remember what happened to bch in 2017? Exchanges didn't have bch liquidity, everyone wanted it because of the coinbase listing. The price went bananas 10x in few days. It's a demand/supply chart. Even if an asset is a monkey card, but people want it and it's scarse, its price is gonna skyrocket. Basic economic laws.

Facepalming myself until I bleed. It's hard money. Hard money, not Fiat. It's not pure speculation you fools. Nobody puts 200B in an asset to speculate. Read Bitcoin the standard and you will understand the value of bitcoin. It has intrinsic value. Much more than gold or any possible currency.

This is what I will never understand about nowadays society. There's some moron who has done something in a certain field, then automatically he becomes entitled to talk about anything in any field, and somehow we are supposed to give him credit because he's the guy. Truth is, the biggest ignorant can sometimes say something extremely intelligent and the opposite, the most intelligent person doesn't have to know everything in any field. On the opposite he can talk bs most of the time. People have low self confidence so they see these 'successful' people speaking and they say, ahh mr X is talking. He must be right. Pathetic. Statements should be based on the content not the speaker.
