Banks like people with mediocre credit, not really good or really bad. Really bad people go bankrupt, really good people pay off debt too early. Mediocre people have consistent debt, make small payments, and earn the bank huge sums of interest money. 
Therefore, you don't need fantastic credit to get big, stupid loans, just mediocre credit that will put you in debt to a bank for the rest of your life.

Yes, I am well aware it is a Latin root word. It is not capitalized at all, and certainly not completely capitalized like "FIAT."

If everyone agrees that the attack was malicious, then we could simply revert the blockchain to its original state. Furthermore, if Sunny suddenly tried to revert the blockchain, especially without posting on Peercointalk, I doubt anyone would agree and revert the chain without any questions asked. 


Blocks being "useless" is a subjective term. One person's blockchain is another's junkchain. The checkpoints are there so everyone is more or less forced by majority to accept each other's idea of which one is which.

The algorithm Litecoin uses is neither new nor innovative. Litecoin was not the first coin to implement Scrypt and it didn't even implement it correctly. You're not supposed to be able to use a GPU to calculate Scrypt. It should take 32 GB RAM at the least.

It is based on the amount of available data per block. There is a max data cap on block size and each transaction takes up a few bytes of the data cap. Asssuming blocks are 10 minutes apart, that allows for a maximum of 7 transactions per second to be placed into the block.
I don't have the numbers on me at the moment as far as the data cap and bytes per transaction are concerned. I believe they increased the block size limit in the recent release, allowing for more transactions.

Ever wonder why KnC won't sell more Jupiters or upgrades? Well, now you know! They've probably been building hundreds of them for months with plans to mine all for themselves. Not only screwing the network over, but screwing over their own Neptune customers. Their data center is going to skyrocket the network difficulty, just in time for them to ship Neptunes which will never see ROI.
For anyone thinking "Plan B" will save Neptune customers (i.e. ME) think again. Plan B is only after they destroyed the difficulty and they will only give EXACTLY 3 TH/s (confirmed by Liam on KnC forums). That means if your Neptune mines at 4 TH/s, guess what? KnC will keep 25% of your miner's hashrate! Not only did they screw you over, they add insult to injury by making even more money on your loss. Thanks, KnC, for being just as sleazy as everyone else.

Peercoin nodes will not relay the same block twice. This means if you broadcast Block 1 on Fork A, you can not broadcast Block 1 on Fork B. 
You'll either have to use a different block or different nodes. If you use a different block you used a different stake, meaning the system works as intended. Using different nodes will result in a higher chance of orphan'ing your block.

You can't reuse stake, as the core software will reject multiple identical stake signatures.
You seem to be thinking of stake as the block header, rather than the hashing being done. Stake in a PoS is interchangable with a mining machine in PoW. You can attempt to mint stake over and over again, but you can only use the stake once across all blockchains. Meaning you can not claim the same stake block on two different chains (which is what the "nothing at stake vulnerability" claims you can do).

Even after the block amount defaults to 10,000 (forever) that's 1,440,000 coin a *day*. At roughly 525 million coins a year, dogecoin is going to do nothing but hyperinflate.
The momentary increase in price can't last. There simply aren't enough people who take the coin seriously enough to pay USD or BTC for it. Investors have tried to play the "fun, entertaining" market, but have underestimated how short that markets attention span is and how little money that market has.
Dogecoin is going to have a lot of very unfortunate bagholders. One look at shows that they really do want the price to go up. They joke about not caring, but you can tell some have very vested interest in the price. They'll be powerless as they watch the coin hyperinflates so badly that Bitcoin won't be divisible enough to buy a few thousand dogecoins.
I feel like despite Dogecoin being for new people, a lot of people there are trying to take advantage of them.

Work is in fact property, not just the results, but the work itself. This is why work contracts exist.
Information is also property, otherwise, secrets would not be possible. To say something isn't property is to say you can't own it, when you can indeed own information. People often pay more for information than any other commodity, as not only is it property, it is one of the most valuable types of property. 
You can not gain information without placing work into it (which you may own, or your employer), or by receiving it from other people, either with money, as a gift, or by stealing it. 
For example, my favorite color is information. Not important information, but information nonetheless. At some point, I had to view many colors and decide which one is my favorite. I put the work into, so I own my favorite color. If I do not wish anyone to know my favorite color, then that is my choice. If I wish to sell "OrderAmongChaos's favorite color" as a file on the Internet, that is my choice. Never does it stop being my information. I simply allow others to use it. 
As another example, this is why people are upset that the NSA is taking their information without consent.

If any coin has a significant advantage Bitcoin can simply absorb the code and move on. If you really want to argue that the first mover Bitcoin has failed, well you could say it already has. The Bitcoin clients of today are not compatible with older clients, essentially making them a different network.
The initial Bitcoin protocol has already been changed and morphed to add features and stay competitive, thus staving off cloned coins. Bitcoin can improve on a large scale much faster than any protocol or company can.
The only way Bitcoin could be completely destroyed is if a coin that was entirely unlike it in every way, but also better, were developed and maintained. So far, every coin has been based on Bitcoin's blockchain, and therefore they are all essentially Bitcoin with added features.

The market cap is irrelevant. Even the term itself is a misnomer, because currencies don't have a market cap. Market capitalization is only for company shares.
What is relevant is that a currency that is used by very few people (estimates range from 0.5-4 million people) is seeing a notable transaction rate on Overstock (and Overstock is only serving US customers!). It is a big milestone for Bitcoin as a whole. Comparing to the dollar is nonsense.

The problem here is that E-gold, E-dollars, Paypal, libertydollars and all sorts of attempts at currency are centralized and not trust-less.

It's easy to talk about, but you nor anyone else are going to do anything about it. Unless a company exists somewhere is willing to sell ASICs at their face hardware value (instead of sucking as much money out of people as they can) then mining will become something for the elite, not the common man. 90% of the Bitcoin community cannot afford to drop $30,000 on an ASIC and cannot afford to take a loss by running a miner that burns more electricity than it makes in Bitcoin.

You are confusing the information (my favorite color) with a physical characteristic (color). 
An easy way to avoid this is to know information must be learned to be obtained. For example, I can have a bar of gold, and later forget I have it. It doesn't cease being mine simply because I forgot it. However, if I for some reason forget my favorite color, then it is no longer information that belongs to me. I will have to put work back into obtaining the information that is my favorite color.
It gets into a gray area if you start writing information down, but then you're more or less converting information into a physical property that contains information, rather than making the information itself physical.

He would destroy his Peercoin, but we could easily fork the network and start anew without checkpoint pulsing. To me, checkpoints even if used as an attack vector is at worst a short term issue. 


I suppose he could, but I'm not personally worried. As I said before, even if such a thing happens, it would be a short term issue.


I don't think you're understanding the article (you seem to be reading it literally and because it doesn't mention the word consensus it therefore doesn't do that). I don't know if the article is simply ignorant or purposefully omitting it, but block consensus is exactly what the checkpointing is for.
Let me say it simply. You're trying to block a DoS attack. This attack can be blocked with checkpoints. This is because the checkpoints tell a Bitcoin client "This must be the real blockchain" and it would reject the blockchain the attacker is attempting to give you.
This results in two options. The attacker could be giving you bogus blocks that would have been rejected regardless. However, an attacker could give you a legitimate but modified blockchain, yet it would still be rejected because his block C doesn't match the checkpoint block C. Bitcoin checkpointing is deciding which blockchain is "real". 
Even if given unlimited computer power I could not rewrite the entire blockchain because it would result in different block hashes and therefore bitcoin clients would reject it due to checkpointing. If you don't regard that as controlling consensus, then I don't know what else to say.


You and I must have different ideas of what "inexpensive" is.

What the general public thinks is irrelevant. As a technology, knowing the creator would only serve to hamper the natural evolution of Bitcoin. Developers would give unneeded weight to what the creator says (simply because the creator said it) and give unneeded attention to him. The protocol needs the real attention. As Bitcoin pushes forward, and if it is as truly as revolutionary as Satoshi hoped, the public won't have a choice whether to use it or not. It will make all other systems obsolete. If it doesn't, then I don't see how knowing who made it would help.

Considering the vulnerability would still require a lot of time to use (as it requires that you brute force a private key) and it also requires access to the public key, the attacker would be very selective in their attacks. I would imagine they would mainly attack high value addresses that have revealed their public key (they have at least one output transaction). This makes it likely an attacker would go after exchange hot wallets, that is of course assuming they're just after money. The attacker may have different motivations. The attacker may wait until Bitcoin is widely used, and purposely drain political donation or government funds solely to damage that organization.

The top problem with bitcoin is that it has no consumer index. Consumer price indexes are what make currencies non-volatile, because at that point you're never buying/selling your currency, you're simply exchanging it for goods and services. 
For Bitcoin to have a long term value, there must be companies that take bitcoin as money. No, I don't mean companies that look at the current exchange rate to calculate a bitcoin payment. For example, I want to sell an apple for 0.02 bitcoin. I didn't think "well, its worth $3... and that is 0.005 bitcoin..." I simply want 0.02 bitcoin. Then someone, who was paid in bitcoin through their employer, will decide if my apple it worth their bitcoin. If it isn't, they won't buy it, and i'll have to lower my price to 0.01 bitcoin. This is how currencies actually work, and this is why bitcoin isn't a currency yet. Bitcoins are valued in dollars (I'm not referring to their dollar value, they are valued in dollars). A Euro also has a dollar value, but it isn't valued in dollars. These are the biggest hurdles for Bitcoin to gain dominance.
I also suggest everyone move the Bitcoin decimal. There aren't about ~12,000,000 bitcoins. There are 1,200,000,000,000,000 bitcoins (currently called a satoshi). Using this math one bitcoin currently costs about $0.0000062.

Worst case scenario Internet goes to a "whitelist" network layout, meaning by default all of your connections are denied and IPs/DNS must be whitelisted to give access. Imagine you buy X Internet package and X gives you access to Yahoo, Facebook and various news sites, but nothing else. If you were to try to connect to Reddit using X internet package, your connection would be halted at the ISP. This would destroy P2P networks, especially mainstream ones, because the average person is not willing to or isn't in a position to bypass the ISP.
That is, however, the worst case scenario and is extremely unlikely to happen considering it would devastate the economy surrounding the Internet. It would also only work in ISP centric locales, such as the US.

This quite simply isn't true. The rich do get richer in Bitcoin.  There are printing presses in Bitcoin, and they are very expensive. You don't see anyone with a $20k a year income running mining farms, do you? It's probably because only people who were either rich beforehand or made money on Bitcoin can actually buy the printing presses. Soon it will take millions of dollars in capital just to have a small portion of the mining percentage. ASICs are just the beginning. Bitcoin is destined to be a game for the elite.

You can mine other coins and trade them for Bitcoin or you can keep the coin itself. The cryptocurrency market expands beyond Bitcoin, I personally own more in Peercoin than I do in Bitcoin, but I won't bother you with trying to advertise coins.
The 300 accepted is your shares. In pool mining, hashrate is nice, but it isn't what really matters, what matters is how many shares your card produces. Shares are blocks that the pool can use to solve a larger, real block to place on the blockchain. Consider them pieces of a puzzle that unlock the real reward. Pools give you your coin reward based on the amount of shares you gave them, not your hashrate.
It is well known by overclockers that the faster you push a processor, the less accurate it becomes. The same thing applies to mining. The harder you push your hashrate, the less accurate each hash is. This means you get the highest sharerate around a medium-high hashrate than you do an extreme hashrate. Each card varies, so you might want to tweak it using MSI Afterburner, TRIXX, or some other overclock utilities.

That really depends on the computers. Most computers don't have dedicated graphics, so let's limit ourselves to the CPU, let's assume grannies everywhere now have hexa cores, just to high-ball the estimate.
1 million infected computers with a AMD Phenom(tm) II X6 1055T Processor at 15.8 MH/s is about 15.8 TH/s, which over three days would be about 20.1 BTC (or $15,000 at current prices). 
So, assuming you can infect a lot of low-end computers, hash at max rate, and host your own pool, additionally handling all of this without being arrested for botnetting, then you could net a significant amount of money over a relatively short period of time.
There are other considerations, such as running the computers at 100% (very noticable) versus 5% which may go for a long time without being noticed. Like playing a version of Pandemic or Plague Inc.

Moving that money out of Bitcoin will be difficult, you'll have to convince people that they'll make more money with a different coin in the long term. This is why most altcoins see temporary pumping and dumping, but Bitcoin steams ahead. Altcoins are where the temp money is, but Bitcoin is the long term champion.

I think it needs to be clarified that banks are a service built on top of an existing system. There is nothing stopping a bitcoin bank from being built, but the point is that Bitcoin will force banks to more properly manage their fees and services. No longer will you be forced to have a bank in order to have an account, or forced to choose between banks. Instead, you will have more freedom to choose whether to have a bank at all. Some people don't think the fraud protection and other services are worth the money, or think that banks don't properly invest their finances. 
Merchants can also be bothered by banks, primarily small business owners. For example, PayPal is great, if you're a buyer. But as a seller, PayPal can be brutal, unforgiving, and a downright frustrating experience to use. Why then, do we use it? Because there really is nothing else. PayPal is the only company out there used by a lot of people because it is the only company that waded through the financial sector's red tape. 
Bitcoin gives us an alternative. It has its positives and its negatives, but it fills an important economic role: cash for the internet. It's an option to have. No one is (well, should be) saying that we should use nothing but Bitcoin, but bitcoin is an option to have, and make sure that people are aware of its benefits compared to its detractions.

The protocol mandates the rules on how the currency is distributed, how it can be transferred, and it contains rules on how the ledger is maintained. 
I wouldn't classifiy bitcoins as shares because shares are an entirely different economic beast. Owning more bitcoins doesn't give you more control over the protocol, only your mining power gives you more control.
Bitcoin doesn't have to money. The protocol itself can be any number of things, Namecoin, for example, attempts to replicate a DNS registrar, by using the ledger to track what domains are controlled by any given person.

Buffett admits that he doesn't invest in anything he does not understand. He clearly didn't understand what Bitcoin is, as he referred to it as "digital checks." He also doesn't understand the tech market and as such won't invest in it. Things like raw metals don't require understanding an industry, as raw metal will always be in demand, regardless of what they're being used for. His investment advice works for all sorts of markets, he simply sticks to the safe markets that he knows 100% that he will make a return on investment. 
I think the disconnect here is you tie his beliefs with his words, when I do not. I think more literally, though it is not always correct.

It is only a matter of time before something better comes along, but I think Bitcoin will be on top, stay on top, and continue to gain traction for at least a decade. 
I like to think of Bitcoin as the gold and silver of the information age. The Internet has made people want things, and want things "now." Bitcoin is capable of delivering that kind of "now" attitude (barring the confirmations). Gold and silver are bulky, hard to transport/buy/physically obtain on top of being hard to liquidate. I can liquidate all of my Bitcoins and have dollars in my bank account within a day or so (depending on what exchange I use) while they have been physically in my possession most of the time. 
Gold and silver aren't going anywhere, of course, but I think a solid chunk of gold/silver investors will move to Bitcoin, simply because most investors buy gold/silver that is never actually delivered to them and kept in bank vaults where they can't verify their stash. Bitcoin can give every buyer that warm, fuzzy feeling of having their coins secured.

Liam stated if you choose the Plan B hosting option (if it is available) you will get exactly 3 TH/s. If the Neptune hashes at a higher rate, unless Liam or KnC intends to scale their hosted hashrate with the Neptune's real hashrate, then the conclusion must be that they are simply shaving the rest of the hashrate for themselves.
I find this to be a very likely option because they are saying they won't charge a service fee or electrical rates, which stands to reason they're definitely not doing it that way just to be nice, they're offering that because they want hosting to sound like a very good option. A very good option they can shave profit from.

I'm sure they've gotten better over the years with newer battery tech and more efficient architectures. There was a time I wanted to game but needed a laptop, and my line of thinking was "why not both?" which turned out to be a horrific plan. It was an Asus and even when not gaming and screen brightness turned all the way down, it lasted a whopping 40 minutes. 
Maybe I'm just a bit bitter after a bad run-in with gaming laptops, but I remember people warning me that it isn't a good idea, and I subsequently ignored them and discovered that in my case, it wasn't a good idea. I want to note that I don't think anything is necessarily bad about gaming laptops, that just, for a lot of people, better options usually exist.

Absolute garbage. No entity can decide to buy half the coins of any POS coin, because thousands of people own the coins individually, you'd have to collaborate with each person (without letting the others know what you're doing). You'd end up spending a shit load of money just to what, crash a cryptocurrency for giggles?
Then what? They would make another one. Cryptocurrencies are a cancer you can't destroy. You can copy the system over and over again. A POS coin is even harder to take over when the system is copied, because you'd have to, once again, own 51% of the coin age. Unlike a new POW coin which can have its difficulty destroyed overnight, killing it instantly (see Feathercoin).

The blockchain is capable of much more than wealth transfer. The Bitcoin protocol tracks information among a decentralized group of peers that don't trust each other.

Then you're not mining the same stake on the same fork and therefore the attack is no different than mining on two PoW chains at the same time with two different machines. The original idea behind "nothing at stake" was that you can mine with the same machine on two chains, which can't actually happen. The result is that you are placing a part of your stake on one chain and another stake on another chain, which means the system is working as intended.

In order for a system that has investors behind it to be completely replaced, another system has to arrive that drives the old one into obsolesence. Netflix steamrolling Blockbuster would be a good example. Netflix was so outrageously more convenient than Blockbuster, that Blockbuster had no choice but to either compete or disappear. Unfortunately they chose the disappear option and are now (close to) bankrupt.
This means the new coin can't just be a clone of Bitcoin. Something has to come along in which people who use Bitcoin have no choice but to use the new thing. It has to be so unbelievably better, that it will make Bitcoin obsolete. I just can't see that happening soon. Bitcoin's source code is so malleable that just about anything that comes along, Bitcoin can just absorb the code. I think Bitcoin has real, long term value that will make many old systems obsolete.

ETC is Ethereum Classic, the "hacked" blockchain of Ethereum. ETH is the original Ethereum blockchain hardforked to reverse the hack attack.

ETC is the result of a hardfork that ETH performed to undo transactions that a hacker made to take millions of ETH. This of course upset the hacker and everyone who wanted ETH to fail miserably.

Decentralization by its very nature causes these sorts of problems. The reason bitcoin is being held up by this isn't because a small group of people control it, but instead a bunch of individual people with all their own interests control it. 
Even a person who owns 0.1 bitcoin has power in the bitcoin network and that power is to say "I'm done" and sell their share of the network and then refuse to buy until the miners get desperate for income and change their ways. Since people aren't doing that (yet?), clearly this problem isn't as big as it's made out to be.

You can't transfer coins between forks, but you could trade them on exchanges (e.g. Ethereum and Ethereum Classic are just two chain forks).
So no, you can't make a new chain and send coins from one chain to the other and you can't make 100x your coins. You could theoretically make money by exchanging coins between the chains. You could also lose a lot of money by guessing the wrong chain will survive and consolidating your money onto a chain that dies.

While that is a good strategy assuming the value continues to increase, this graph still won't give you a good look at your gains. In order to duplicate the kind of gains Bitcoin has seen over the past five years, the bitcoin price would need to be about 41 million dollars per bitcoin in 2022. I think that's a tad excessive, though I'll happily say otherwise should that be the case in 2022.

Bulk buys can get deep discounts that would offset the overall narrow margins these ASIC companies are offering. Look at it this way, you'll make more money with an ASIC than you will buying the coins directly, but for a single person who doesn't command much capital, the profit percentage is too low to make it worth the effort. I would much more willingly accept a 5% profit if I started with 10,000 BTC than I would accept a 5% profit starting with 10 BTC. The percentage is the same, but there is a big difference between the two investments because you make more with the larger sum of capital in the same amount of time.

That's a flawed argument and requires a rather elementary concrete view of what wealth is. If wealth were only related to concrete items, then our modern day market wouldn't exist, as it is based entirely on the abstraction of wealth. Mining Bitcoin no more destroys wealth than the printing press destroys wealth when it prints out USD. Burning a house down doesn't destroy wealth, either. In fact, hapless destruction like that tends to create consumption demand, which drives economic growth. This is why war is such a great way to kickstart an economy. 
Wealth itself is simply an abstract concept brought on by the desire to have an object, concrete or otherwise. It's created and destroyed at will by the human mind.

This graph is kind of misleading, though, as you get a very large percentage of your return from buying $20 of bitcoin when it was just a few cents or a few dollars each. 
Just a ball park estimate, I would say 90% of your gains come from the first $100 you put in starting at five years ago and the next four years is only 10% of your gains. All this chart would prove is that you should have invested five years ago, not that buying a little bit of bitcoin every other day was a meaningful strategy (not that you can't do that, I'm just saying the chart feels misleading).

After three years rebels have all but confirmed that their once beloved hero and heroine have perished in the cold of the Artic attempting to locate a mythical ship, the Borealis. While the two were attempting to recover the vessel, rebels thought they had severed the Combine from their world.
They were wrong.
A new portal emerged, out pouring thousands of combat class Combine units. Battle after battle was waged, the rebels lost at every turn. Downtrodden and hopeless, the rebels began to back down. Then, as if the gods themselves granted a gift, the rebels had a new hope. Bitcoin. With it, their outposts could transfer wealth instantly without Combine interference. Soon, the rebel war machine was back in action with the strongest economic advantage of the century. 
However, Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance were still no where to be found.  They say that one day Gordon Freeman will return with a crowbar and a pocket full of Bitcoins, ready to defeat the Combine once and for all.

What you're implying is that because the time to find a block is lower, that the probability of finding a block at the same time is higher. The only difference between Bitcoin and Litecoin is the number of orphaned blocks, not the probability. While you are correct in saying that Litecoin will ultimately result in more orphans (because there are more blocks) saying that the probability is higher is not true.
Basically, instead of flipping a coin once every ten minutes, you're flipping it once every 2.5 minutes. Probability is unchanged, but you're going to have more numeric heads/tails with the faster coin. As such, Litecoin will be less desirable for those with little to no network connection.

Considering the people and money behind their project, I say it's a pretty safe bet that their release date and hash rate advertisements are accurate. However, even assuming they are 100% accurate, the machine itself has a very narrow margin of error. If any variable is off (lower hash rate, longer release date, higher difficulty than expected, higher power consumption) then your machine will not pay for itself. I personally trust them completely, but unless they make a more reasonable price, there is no sense in buying from them. Even after their price reduction, the chance of making even a slim profit is too narrow.

It's a combination of $/hash, total hashrate, difficulty, and release date.

The trustworthy ones that are selling to the public are doing so with very narrow margins of error, too narrow for me. Some people like the risk, but I don't think the risk justifies the reward. Even assuming Cointerra does everything on time and correctly, you would still make a laughably small profit.

They only have to mention Bitcoin by name.

There is no need to identify other currencies. If it becomes obvious that governments don't like the idea of Bitcoin and slow it down, then people will stop adopting it. Legal issues aside, all it would take is a psychological attack on the currency and the mass market will drop Bitcoin like it was the plague.

Litecoin mining is dependant on memory bandwidth. To be faster than a GPU, a LTC ASIC would have to have greater than GDDR5 bandwidth. It doesn't really matter how much processing power you throw at LTC if the bandwidth per processor isn't high enough. Any ASIC made for LTC will be basically a stand-alone GPU, meaning you'll save on bulk costs, but they won't actually be faster than any current GPU if you compare them on a one to one scale.

Bitcoin may be opt-in, but the rules can change because there is no contract or solid foundation. The majority can and will make Bitcoin what they see fit, regardless of how the minority feels. All governments were opt-in once upon a time, then they became powerful. Bitcoin will go the same route, assuming it becomes powerful. Bitcoin has a ruling power that may one day control the very wealth of nations. Everyone who thinks Bitcoin will be their lord and savior will find that it is the same thing they've had all along.

If the market stops reacting so wildly to these attacks, they would no longer be a problem. When you can make thousands of dollars by attacking a volatile exchange, you can easily pay for the resources to do so. If the market fails to react, the attacker loses money and will stop.

Once you hit the bandwidth cap, the processor speed doesn't matter. It wouldn't make a difference if you had an infinite amount of cores running at an infinite speed, once the bandwidth buffer is full, it's game over. You might be thinking of processors rather than cores. You can have multiple processors each with their own bandwidth, but they still wouldn't be faster than a GPU. In other terms, with Bitcoin you can still build vertically (more hashrates per processor), but with LTC you can only build horizontally (more units hashing concurrently). AMD and Nvidia put a lot of R&amp;D in memory bandwidth, more than any person or company mining cryptocurrency can command. What they're putting out is as good as it is going to get for a while.

Trade implies ownership, and objective ownership is where you're going wrong. You don't own 100% of your income because you didn't put in 100% effort.

Bitcoin is more than just a currency, it is a network, and as with any network, it requires quite a lot of applications to be applied on top of it. Bitcoin isn't ready for wide public use, but your extrapolation of the current situation infinitely into the future is unnecessary.

Various brokers and fund managers have contracts with their clients that stipulates what they can and can't invest in so that their clients' desires are looked after. For example, by contract a manager may only be able to invest in tech stocks or pharmaceuticals.

Undervalued by what standard? Only utility can determine value, but right now BTC value has been determined by speculators. For example, BTC is worth more than LTC, but does it have more utility? The answer is no. They do literally the same thing. Why then would I pay for more than the other? The only answer is that BTC has a higher chance of making me free money. 
The disconnect here seems that, unfortunately, you don't know what value is and isn't. Just because you're willing to pay (or someone else is willing to pay) $1000 for a digital coin, doesn't mean it is worth $1000. Bitcoin survives on nothing more than the Greater Fool theory.

Why should I pay $1000 for something people paid $100 for just a few months ago, and then fractions of a penny only two years ago? The real answer is that quite frankly, I shouldn't. But I pay it anyway, because I think it will be worth more later. Will it be worth more later? Probably. Should it? Bitcoin has utility, but right now its utility does not justify its price. Once the speculation drive stops, it'll drop like a rock, because as of right now, Bitcoin is just a way to make free money, not actually be used

Assuming that Bitcoin is "the next big thing" is fallacious. Furthermore, you're implying that because Bitcoin is hard to regulate, governments can't get rid of it. All the government has to do is shut down the legitimate exchanges (such as MtGox) and the market will leave cryptocurrency out in the cold. Yes, Bitcoin may still exist, but in the same way that hidden Tor sites exist. It will be vastly unpopular and its worth will be a few dollars at best.

No government program gives money to someone in the hopes that they work harder or smarter. The government grants money to those that have proven they are already working harder or smarter. No one is going to get a full college grant for having a 2.0 GPA and no company is going to be awarded a DOD contract for sitting on their ass all day.

I still don't understand the point of paper wallets. What good reason is there to store the keys on paper when a thumb drive or CD/floppy is available? Is there something about paper that is magical and I'm missing out?

But what if he buys so much that the Bitcoin economy collapses and Bitcoin never becomes worth much money? You've damaged the timeline, buddy. Put it back.

Bitcoin is a system of currency collectively defined by the group of people using it. It is, at its most basic level, a simple majority-rules government lording over the currency. I see no reason that an anarchist would like to use a currency that s/he has no control over.

Whether the government should or should not do something is irrelevant to the discussion. The previous poster used only one issue as a basis for not paying taxes, which is akin to tunnel vision.

Nothing could possibly make a government more happy than their citizens all cheerily using a currency that can be tracked 24/7 automagically and without any real effort on their part. Bitcoin is only anonymous if you try really hard, the masses will use it and be laughably easy to watch. It's a financial Big Brother wet dream. It's even better that Bitcoin has no master government. Each government can not only watch its own citizens, but watch others' as well. Bitcoin is war on a whole new level.

Yes, taxes 100% go towards that and do nothing else at all. They don't fund research grants, education, transportation, agriculture, utilities or anything else at all. Let us all put on our tunnel vision glasses so we can be just like you.

People get *really* weird when they think you have such vast amounts of money that you no longer talk about it.

Then it wouldn't be a *paper* wallet anymore.

The percentage difference between $1 and $1000 is the same as the difference between $1000 and $1 million. Bitcoin reaching $1 million a piece is entirely plausible, assuming exponential market adoption, which isn't happening.

I expected something entirely different when I clicked on this post. Don't get me wrong, this is awesome too, I'm just saying, I expected something else.

No, you're parroting rhetoric made by the angsty "anarchy" teens here. It's laughable, at best. "They're robbing me! they're robbing you!" Hahaahah, you're probably not even old enough to have paid taxes before.

The chip is not the issue, the memory bandwidth is. GPUs mining litecoins do so at a much slower pace than mining Bitcoin, because they hit their memory bandwidth caps for processing Scrypt. An ASIC might be more efficient energy-wise, but it won't be any faster. A Scrypt ASIC is not going to have better bandwidth than a 7970 and therefore it won't be able to hash faster.

Both are driven by speculation and had nowhere near their price in actual worth. Bitcoins are worth what people are willing to pay for them and speculators may wake up one day to realize no one wants a $1000+ bitcoin. The price is driven purely by speculation, nothing else.

Form of currency has nothing to do with tax collection power. Taxes existed before banks or any type of government mandated currency, they'll continue to exist even if the world solely used Bitcoin. Taxes rely on wealth, not currency.

The problem is that Gox is the easiest exchange to get money into and the hardest to get out of. People are buying coins on Gox and others are selling their coins on exchanges that can withdraw more easily. The real Bitcoin price is probably somewhere around $110, with Gox being too high and other exchanges being too low.

That would depend on what you define worth to be. To me, Bitcoin's worth is its utility, and that will increase when it is useful to a lot of people, and Bitcoin simply doesn't have enough mainstream applications to do that or businesses to spend it at. Having things like Bitpay and Gyft is great and all, but the people on this subreddit need to face that you're just middle-man'ing your way to the business. Businesses, for the most part, just want the fiat, not Bitcoin, which is not what we want to see. Bitcoin will be worth money when people will take it as money. A lot of people, as in more than just a few hundred thousand hardcore bitcoiners.
