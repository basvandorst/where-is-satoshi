don't you guys think it is manipulation ????
@_date: 2018-04-01 09:24:20
so far I found two vital and very important  reason for this huge crash 1st is Mt gox yes they are still not done yet still they have huge portion of Bitcoin and 2nd is an article just been released, its about (cartel) we dont know how deep the price they target here is the link      
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:01:41
since Jan btc every little spike get me lot of hope then next day it's turn out a very disappointing deep mil of times this repeated and mil of times I got exited only this time I m not excited coz next day I might see another deep  I would be very happy if I m wrong 
@_date: 2018-04-01 11:07:46
why huge crash I think every one should read this article 
@_date: 2018-04-21 11:30:39
most ridiculous price action 
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:05:13
you would be shocked check out this btc adress guys 	
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:56:57
might be mt gox or fucking big exchange trying  to trade with our money 
@_date: 2018-04-12 17:41:07
just couple of days ago TA specialist mansion that bitcoin passing very crucial time either bitcoin break out either bitcoin break down based on TA looks like bitcoin break out
@_date: 2018-04-07 16:11:33
seems uptrend started coz btc also reject to go bellow 6400$
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:24:28
what is the news for today?
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:37:10
seems buy vs sell war going ...too much sell pressure but at a same time demand of btc for discount buying force also high   
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:06:23
seems like bullmarket started 
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:55:59
now approaching towards 6k again  
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:56:20
is dumping just started ??
@_date: 2018-04-28 01:03:22
is Mt Gox reason for this dip ?
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:48:42
market manipulation no doubt 
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:55:46
any news??
@_date: 2018-04-01 18:03:06
this is no longer depend on TA its all about market manipulation just hoping when is the bottom and bounce back 
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:36:01
well it's concern me every penny drop till bitcoin rich 10k,200$ drop is is huge seems like btc dumping not done yet 
@_date: 2018-04-09 11:14:24
every exchange should ban market manipulation , if they want they easily can find the person who is doing this again and again and let us know who is that fucker 
@_date: 2018-04-09 10:49:35
if manipulation then technical analysis is absolutely worthless they can pump to 12k then bring it down to 6k again 
@_date: 2018-04-07 15:45:09
hahahha seems u noticed my last comment lol... actually I am talking about price action btc reject to go bellow 6400$ based on TA specialist btc must go over 7400$ to avoid bear market and we heading towards nicely despite few bad news    
@_date: 2018-04-12 13:31:56
is it bull trap ??
