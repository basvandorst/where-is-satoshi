Wait, there's MORE free shitcoins I can claim? I just got the BCH.

minus one that's three QUICK MATHS

You're talking about taking someone's money without their consent. Regardless of what you intend to do with it, that's theft.

The fun thing about being POTUS is that it doesn't matter if things age badly, so long as they don't age badly in the next 4/8 years. After that it really doesn't matter.

Very big, very large, very bigly if true, yes.

It's too bad there aren't places on the darkweb where you can trade bitcoins for drugs.
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:04:48
Thanks man, I'll take those precautions.
@_date: 2019-07-30 12:12:00
What are you trying to say here?
@_date: 2019-07-02 10:49:44
Very cool, thanks.

And yet less so than ever before in human history.

Sounds like a proper lad, I'd buy him a pint.

Dude that's my favourite Aerosmith song!

I can't hear you because I'm on the moon and you're on earth and you're very quiet.

They don't need their legs.

Ah yes, I saw that in the documentary Terminator 2: Judgement Day.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:22:04
wanna buy some Bitcoin Cash? It feels like a ball &amp; chain around my ankle.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:22:03
Sometimes it is that easy, you've just got to be insanely lucky. Lucky for me I was born as a very lucky person, and I'm holding bitcoin, so logically bitcoin WILL go to the moon.
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:47:44
That's cool, I'm panic holding.
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:07:21
13 moon bases?

Please tell me your name isn't a Fortnite meme reference

The implosion of all global fiat currencies and the adoption of bitcoin as the defacto global currency. Mark my words.

I turn 31 tomorrow and I've never been anywhere. I think it's time I started seeing the world.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:32:11


That's why I bought bitcoin: I'd like to get rich, but I'd rather get a future where banks don't own the planet.
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:30:33
Or be really, really smart and buy one of those "OneWheel" electric skateboards and roll around town looking like the queen of sheba.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:05:19
You're gonna end up selling before a massive spike, or buying before a massive dip. You can't perfectly predict where the market's gonna go. My solution keeps me invested in bitcoin's future without having to waste time trading back and forth.
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:05:39
Better with audio
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:36:54
Right, and I have neither the time nor the inclination to keep track of the various potential catalysts. Buy low, hodl high.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:22:01
Sell for... what? Fiat? It's still worth more as BTC. So the better advice would be to buy low and hodl high.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:22:31
Into the dirt. When BTC hits $0.00, I'll concede that the ride might be over.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:40:24
PEOPKE! HODL!
@_date: 2019-06-28 14:32:33
No need to be upset at memes.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:23:00
I think there's a lot of 20k guys who are waiting for the value to hit 21k so they can cash the fuck out and never think about crypto ever again.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:33:02
I bought at $6.5k, thought that was about as deep as it was going to go. Still pretty happy with it as a purchase.
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:29:46
We're too close! Loosen up!
@_date: 2019-12-16 16:42:48
Yeah, that's genuinely what we're looking at: tabloids acting ridiculous for attention. Discussing them only helps them.
@_date: 2017-11-15 09:45:42
You sound like you think your own time investments are the only correct time investments.

You should respect your aunty's gender identity.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:30:27


Sure, but on the other hand, fuck 'em.
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:28:03






I hope it isn't, since that's the only reason I started buying BTC in the first place.
@_date: 2019-05-03 13:22:15
So it just means you own 1 BTC? In that case; I'm in!

They'll lose that shit when someone launches a tax evasion app that makes it as easy as ordering a pizza.
