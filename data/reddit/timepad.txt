There will always be exchanges, but there shouldn't always be a *need* for exchanges just to conduct everyday commerce.
There is immense value in allowing for true person-to-person transactions: it limits the power that governments and bankers have over major aspects of our lives. If you artificially limit the transaction volume though, you force bitcoin commerce to start going through trusted-third-parties again. That's good for bankers, but bad for people.

Ok, to be honest, I can't disagree with this that much. I would prefer to get this change in a hard-fork over the one-time increase. In enough time, it won't really matter anyway, because exponential growth will take over. 
However, if you're fine with exponential growth in the max block size, I really don't understand what's wrong with also adding a buffer. It's going to take at least another year to get the fork launched, and it's already been ~5 years we've been at the 1MB max block size, so why not account for all that time when starting things off?
I'm just not convinced that "encouraging the production of trusted-third-party payment networks" is a worthwhile reason to hamper bitcoin's growth (even if it is only temporarily hampering it). If these payment networks are innovative enough, they will be developed regardless of the maximum block size.
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:58:11


I really disagree here. Technology will continue to grow, and it should remain possible for consumer hardware to run a full node, even with an exponentially increasing block size.
All of those "trust networks" are unproven technology. Bitcoin (and blockchains in general) are the only real way we know to create consensus in a trust-free manner. I don't want to be forced to trust someone else with my money, and many people agree with me. This is bitcoin's core value proposition, and I don't want it destroyed.

You have misplaced your trust. There will come a time when Coinbase abuses their power over the bitcoins they're holding. It will likely be at the behest of the US gov't.
Coinbase is at the mercy of the same gov't that seized all privately held gold less than 100 years ago, the same gov't that continues to fund itself via unsustainable debt.
You have the power to protect yourself from these risks, and actually own a digital asset. All it takes is a few hours of learning and effort to get a proper cold-storage solution set up.
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:01:39
I really don't think there will be any reason for anything so drastic. All the devs seem to agree on the need to increase the max size, there's just disagreement on how much to increase it and how to go about doing so.
The 8MB "compromise" is no good anyway, because it doesn't go far enough. The two most popular proposals (BIP100 and BIP101) both have a baked-in mechanism for future growth, so that we hopefully will never need to go through this drama again.
The "ultimate stress test" showed that Mike Hearn's prediction of the [crash landing]( are unlikely to come to fruition, so I don't think there's as much urgency as some seem to think. I'd much rather we take the time to come to a true consensus, rather than taking a huge risk with a contentious hard-fork.

I don't believe any of the pegged cryptocurrencies are fundamentally sound. Since they don't offer a way to actually convert into the underlying asset that they're pegged to, there is no mechanism to actually keep the price the same as the underlying asset.

Double max size every 4 years, on pace with the block reward halving. Since we skipped the first block halving, it should be doubled to 2 MB right now (or as soon as safely possible), and doubled again to 4 MB with the next halving (which is set to occur sometime in 2016).
This keeps it small enough that a fee market can form over the next years (which seems important to the anti-increase camp), while also including baked-in future growth, so we don't need to go through another hard fork again.

Yeah, regardless of what you think of the rest of this message, this advice is pretty much actively harmful. Instead of downplaying the changes businesses may have to make, this section should have had a lot more emphasis on the fact that businesses need to only accept payments that have received multiple confirmations on the blockchain.
It's almost like Peter wants this change to seem minor and "very little", so rather than providing actually helpful advice to businesses, he puts their business at risk by downplaying the risk they face of double-spends.

Maybe because your original comment was short and snippy: "They certainly are not.".

I'll repost what I posted when I saw this in another subreddit:
I think this person has a few fundamental mis-understandings about crypto-currencies. For example, when they say:


This just makes no sense. The protocol itself limits the rate at which bitcoins are mined via an automatically adjusting difficulty. On average, a block will only be produced once every 10 minutes no matter how efficient miners get at generating sha256 hashes.
This mis-understanding is also apparent in their comment about litecoin:


This statement is just wrong. Litecoin supply is also regulated by an automatically adjusting difficulty level, they just use Scrypt instead of Sha256 for their hash algorithm.
Ultimately, it seems their argument boils down to "demand will never be as high as it was when the price was at 1200, while supply is continuing to increase". I would counter this argument with the the fact that most of the world still hasn't learned about or integrated bitcoin into any of their day-to-day activities. There are still huge untapped markets in remittances and wealth storage alone. Additionally, the rate of increase in supply is in fact decreasing. The block reward halving is coming in less than 2 years, and we're still on track to have 99% of all coins mined before 2040.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:25:24
They do have all the coins on one single address, so I think they are at least a little crazy (or just mis-guided about proper coin storage techniques).
I would be surprised if they're using Armory, or any other solution for offline transaction signing, which means that they'll likely have to have the private keys on an internet-connected computer for at least the time that they're sending out the bitcoins to the auction winner.
Additionally, there's always the chance of a corrupt agent, or some other physical security issue.

I disagree. Hard forks should be rare events, and ideally never again after this one. Hard forks represent a change to the rules that everyone agreed upon. Rule changes shouldn't be necessary except in certain very clear circumstances, where the lack of a rule change would definitely lead to harm.
We may need another hard fork to move off ECDSA when quantum computing becomes a serious threat. But, unless there is a major bug (which we're getting more and more confident there aren't any as time goes on), I can't think of another real reason for another hard fork in the future.

This is just simply untrue. The market cap must be supported by hashing power, or else the motive to launch a 51% attack is too great. Unless Google can somehow instantly ramp up a distributed mining network (read: not all controlled by Google), then it will necessarily take some time to create an altcoin that comes close to bitcoin's market cap.
Because of this, there isn't a strong incentive for an honest party to create an alternative to bitcoin, unless they want to significantly change some properties. If the properties of an altcoin aren't significantly different in some technically novel way, I am highly suspicious of a scam.

I doubt any law will pass in the US that just bans bitcoin outright - that's just too draconian, and it's easy to challenge such a draconian law in the courts and the court of public opinion.
More likely what will happen is they'll pass a set of regulations that effectively cripple bitcoin. These regulations won't make it illegal to accept bitcoin, they'll just make it onerously expensive to comply with accepting bitcoins in a legal manner. They will probably make it illegal for a bitcoin business to hold bitcoin as an investment, so that bitcoin doesn't grow in value. These regulations will be seen as "pro-consumer", rather than draconian. In fact, there will probably even be many members of the bitcoin community that embrace the regulations because they see them as good for themselves and their existing businesses.

Try this thought experiment: Imagine Bitcoin was created with an expanding money supply instead of a fixed supply. How many people do you think would have been interested in investing in bitcoin if this were the case? Why would anyone invest if the supply is infinite, and therefore the value will always trend toward zero? If no one is invested, how many people would improve the eco-system by building businesses and developing open-source code? Very few people would quit their jobs in order to commit their time to making bitcoin better. Bitcoin would have been relegated to a niche academic interest if it had been created with an expanding money supply.
When you think about it this way, you realize that a fixed money supply is the only choice when creating a currency that you hope people will voluntarily adopt.
An expansionary monetary system is only possible when it's backed by force. The US dollar is propped up by legal tender laws, income taxes, and oil that must be paid in dollars - all of which are backed by the force of men with guns.

It's growing slightly faster than linear right now, but with the current 1 MB block size, the growth rate is bounded to linear growth.
Incidentally, I think a good solution to the 1MB blockchain size problem is making the max block size dynamic and exponential - just with a slower growth curve than Moore's law. E.g., change the rule so the max allowed block size doubles every 4 years. With computational resources typically doubling every 18 months, this growth curve would still be slower than the rate of technological growth, so it should still continue getting cheaper to run a full node as time goes on.

That actually sounds a lot like what they'd do. [Executive Order 6102]( in 1933 forbade the "hoarding" of Gold. The federal gov't forcibly bought up all the gold from US citizens at $20.67/oz (imprisoning those that refused to sell). Then right afterward they mandated that the price of gold would be $35/oz.
The point is - they're dicks. It doesn't matter though because bitcoin is designed to be resilient.

Even if he is under a gag order and innocent of actual theft, he still lied. He lied about transaction malleability being the reason the coins were lost. He lied that "all customer funds are safe" for weeks before finally just shutting down the site.
And, regardless of everything that happened recently, Mt. Gox was always an incompetently ran company. From the major hack in 2011, to the extreme trading engine lag in April of 2013, and the horrible withdrawal delays that followed. Karpeles deserves all the derision he receives.

Buying LTC doesn't really increase your privacy at all if the exchange decides to track you, because the Litecoin chain is just as tracable as the BTC chain. You'd be just as well off to just deposit to the exchange and then withdraw.
However, this is a viable strategy if you change chains into an anonymous CryptoNote based altcoin, such as Monero. Monero uses cryptography (ring signatures) to make it difficult to track coin movement. I'm still researching just *how* anonymous it makes you, but it would certainly increase the level of anonymity better than Litecoin or any of the other bitcoin-based blockchains.

"Killing slave owners" is a bad analogy for Charlie's crime. A better analogy would be "freeing slaves".
Personally, I think if you disagree with slavery, you both work to abolish slavery and you work to free any slaves you have the opportunity to free.
Assisting people in voluntarily transacting with other (aka "money laundering") isn't nearly as heroic as freeing slaves, but it still has no victim, and it typically makes the world a better place (as most voluntary trade does). The state and the banks don't like it because it threatens their monopoly on the practice.

This is a fascinating paper, and I recommend you read the whole thing if you're interested in bitcoin and privacy. The author gives a great description of many undocumented aspects of both bitcoin and tor. Specifically bitcoin's DoS protection, and Tor's circuit selection. The behaviors of both can be exploited to force a bitcoin-over-tor user to be redirected to only malicious peers.
I believe that the attack described in this paper would be highly visible - ie, if someone tried to pull it off, it would effect every single bitcoin-over-tor user, and smart people would quickly realize something was amiss. However, that doesn't mean that this attack can't be modified in order to make it more targeted.
I think this paper will be a wakeup call to bitcoiners that care about privacy. Bitcoin over tor is not good enough for link-level privacy. Bitcoin itself should implement authenticated and encrypted communication between peers (this is one of the countermeasures listed in the paper).

This would be huge news! It might even allow US players to play real online poker again, since the only real restriction according to the [Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]( is in blocking banks from sending payments to gambling sites. PokerStars has a history of standing up to this draconian law, so maybe they'll try to test the legal waters once again.
Most likely PokerStars won't be able to simply use BitPay, or any other US payment processor for that matter. Perhaps they'll accept and hold bitcoins directly, and just treat it as another currency to gamble with? PokerStars already supports multiple currencies (Dollars and Euros), so maybe they could just add BTC as a native currency as well? 
Another possible option would be for them to build their own internal exchange, which allows players to deposit bitcoins and then play with dollars, and then subsequently withdraw in bitcoins. This option would leverage PokerStars immense cash holdings in order to handle the exchange rate risk inherent in dealing with any currency exchanging.
If this rumor turns out to be true, I believe it will be the catalyst for the next major rally in bitcoin's price. The US has a huge pent-up demand to play good online poker. I know I miss playing pokerstars dearly, and I would go to great lengths to play it again. If I didn't already know about bitcoin, I'd jump through all the necessary hoops to learn about it if it allowed me to play good online poker again.

Preventing people from getting scammed is noble work. Unfortunately, this commenter is confused about exactly what the scam actually is.
You see, when people that have their heads down in the existing monetary system analyze bitcoin, they come to the conclusion that bitcoin must be a scam. This is because they realize that either bitcoin is a scam, or the entire existing system of debt-based money is a scam. For many people, analyzing the status quo is out of the question, and therefore they come to the wrong conclusions.
Hopefully the commenter eventually analyzes the status quo and realizes where the scam actually lies. In a few years, when bitcoin still hasn't died (and hopefully even had a few more bull runs), they'll likely be inclined to re-analyze their position.

Not really...
He bought he first batch for himself, so those BTC are not owned by his venture firm, Draper Associates.
This time around, he was bidding on behalf of his firm for the express purpose of acquiring bitcoins in order to fund the companies that Boost invests in. They have committed to investing 300 BTC into each of Boost's companies, and they plan on investing into 20-30 companies on their next round. That will require up to 9000 BTC in order to meet their obligations. Since they only acquired 2000 BTC today, they will likely need to buy the rest on the open market in order to fund the rest of the companies.

I think we agree on this more than not. State worship is indeed a disease, however pointing out the specific things that the state does wrong is an important part of breaking the masses out of this disease.
Specific anecdotes like this do far more to convince people of the folly of the state than any abstract philosophical reasoning.


I don't know why you took such a hostile turn at the end there, but you're definitely mistaken about me (if you meant that when you said "you"). I've been advocating against the state well before I knew about bitcoin. Nonetheless, there is nothing insulting about pointing out that in this specific instance, the state has most definitely overstepped its bounds. And, if this instance happens to be the first time that someone sees the truth, then that is good! There's nothing insulting about finally waking up to the truth.

This already has happened, in the form of Mt. Gox. (and many other companies as well, just on a smaller scale). This is where the term GoxBTC comes from - BTC that Mt. Gox owes you isn't nearly as valuable as actual BTC.
For whatever reason (theft, fraud, incompetence) Mt. Gox basically created 600k BTC out of thin air - they owed their customers 600k BTC, but didn't have the physical BTC to actually pay them. For a while, the customers actually thought their GoxBTC were the same as real BTC. But, eventually the house of cards came tumbling down, and MT. Gox went bankrupt. Fortunately, they didn't get bailed out. The market was allowed to fail, and it is now recovering.
One aspect of that recovery is a focus on multi-signature transactions.
This is one reason I'm pretty excited about Coinbase's multi-sig vault (as well as the plethora of other startups that are offering multi-sig solutions). If you're storing your coins using multi-sig (specifically, where the counterparty only has 1 private key, and multiple keys are required), there is zero chance of that counterparty running off with your BTC. If multi-sig coin storage becomes widespread (and I imagine it will be, because it's just one of the best way to store your coins), then there is very little risk of "paper bitcoin" dominating the real market.

Pruning the blockchain isn't really the solution. At most, pruning will achieve a percentage reduction in size of the blockchain, it won't change the rate of growth of the blockchain. And, even with pruning, many will still prefer to run a full node.
The solution is time and technological growth. The blockchain is growing linearly in size, while hard-drive capacities are growing exponentially (as well as CPU speed, memory size, and network bandwidth).

Of course he'd advocate this. Citi runs many of their own ETFs. If central banks hold ETFs instead of just holding the commodities themselves, then Citi stands to gain significantly.

Email messages are still processed by many intermediate routers before hitting their final destination. If the NSA or any other nefarious organization has compromised the routers that your email is sent through, then they know the contents of the email message unless it's encrypted. As far as I'm aware, STARTTLS does nothing to prevent this.
Edit: I may be wrong about this. It looks like STARTTLS is used between intermediate servers as well. Nonetheless, all it takes is one server to not use STARTTLS, and your plaintext message is likely compromised. The fact that you have to trust all these intermediate servers (that have no obligation to keep your secrets private) is not good.

Password managers are way less of a target surface than re-using the same password on every site. And trying to actually remember a different password for every different site you login to is probably not possible given how many different sites we have passwords for these days. Additionally, if you try to remember a different password for every site, you'll probably use weak, low-entropy passwords. A password manager lets you use unique 128-bit (or more) passwords for every website without any extra mental overhead for every new account you create.
You can also minimize the risk of your password manager being compromised by taking the following precautions:
 * Use a very long password for your password manager (since it is basically the only password you have to remember now, this should be easier). 
 * Optionally use a separate password management profile for different sets of sites (security by isolation).
 * Optionally choose to still remember unique long passwords for your most important logins.
 * Use 2-factor authentication wherever possible.
If that doesn't convince you, I can also appeal to authority: security experts like Bruce Schneier [recommend using a password manager](

"Compliance" isn't really producing value though... It's also not really part of the private sector, since the only reason it exists is because of the public sector.
Here's how the cycle works: Regulator creates a series of complex regulations that require businesses to hire a team of lawyers and other professionals just to comply with the regulations (including a high-paying Chief Compliance Officer). Regulator then leaves public sector for high-paying "Chief Compliance Officer" role at some company. The regulator makes a fat paycheck in this role, because he literally wrote the regulations, so he knows them inside and out.
The entire system of regulations in this country is so fucked up, and yet the people are still clamoring for even *more* regulations. Humans are scammed way too easily.

Your argument is that miner fees have gone down as bitcoin grew more popular. However, your argument is flawed, because it's comparing two things over a much different time. In other words, correlation does not prove causation.
The reason correlation doesn't prove causation is because of conflating details, like the fact that the default fee is now 100x lower in terms of BTC price. There are many more conflating details as well: like the larger amount of size in blocks for free transactions, or just the fact that 2 years later, the population of bitcoin users has changed.

It sounds like if you're choosing your own passwords, you aren't really at risk of a hash collision attack. The link even goes on to say:


Either way though, it's a shame we're still relying on passwords for authentication. It requires end users to send their plaintext password to websites, and trust them to properly hash it and not log it anywhere.
A much better authentication scheme would involve public keys, where the server knows only your public key, and you never have to pass any private credentials to the server.

That said, I can still see the rationale for someone that is interested in trading, and also risk tolerant.
The very fact that other's are able to withdraw makes the situation significantly different than the Mt. Gox situation in which trading continued while all withdrawals remained disabled. Even if they are fractional reserve, we know that the fraction is relatively high, or else they would likely have had to limit withdrawals in some manner.

The silk road forums and bitcointalk both used the same unique archaic software setup. There are very few other websites with the same setup on the entire Internet, let alone bitcoin-related websites. This indicates that the same person set up both websites.
This plants a reasonable doubt that Ulbricht set up the Silk Road forums, since he did not have anything to do with the Bitcointalk forums. Additionally, since Karpeles did have a lot to do with the Bitcointalk forums, this fits the narrative that he was involved with Silk Road.

That wager you linked to is for "10 months from now". Gavin's post says he plans on having the change go live "a little less than a year from now". So, even if you believe the change will go live in Gavin's time-frame, you would probably still take the "no" side on that wager.

They're going to accuse him of murder-for-hire, even though he isn't charged with that crime in this case. The prosecution will freely be allowed to call him a murderer, and the judge is going to let it happen.

The Darkcoin team has clearly thought through a lot of issues with anonymity. These security advisories are helpful, however I'm annoyed with the tone that many of these issues can't be solved in bitcoin. There is clearly a conflict of interest here (they're trying to prop up the value of their coin), and it shows.
In my opinion, all of these issues can be solved in bitcoin. The first three issues (change linking and uniquely identifiable amounts) can be solve by using denominated amounts. The fourth issue (DOS attacks) can be solved by using assurance contracts.
Additionally, the first two issues with Coinshuffle are currently solvable by simply modifying your behavior as a user. You can't send your change from an anonymous transaction directly to a non-anonymous location. You have to send it through another round of CoinJoin in order to unlink the change output from the anonymous transaction.

Memorize the Electrum seed. It's 12 words long, which might seem daunting at first. The best way to memorize it is with a [mnemonic]( Split it into two groups of 6, and start focusing on memorizing the first half. After you've got the first half down, make a new mnemonic for the second half, and start memorizing that. Try to recall the seed in many different environments and at many different times. After a few weeks, you'll find that you've got the list fully memorized, and it is effectively a brain wallet now. Although, you should still keep another set of backups just in case you manage to forget. Treat your brain wallet as just another backup.
Do not listen to others advice about taking a bunch of facts about your life that are seemingly random, and combining them together. This is a good way to create a false sense of security, and a password with significantly less entropy than you think it has. Humans are awful at generating randomness.

8GB blocks will allow for ~3 billion transactions per day. Personally, I wouldn't be surprised if we do another hard-fork in 2036 to keep doubling again for another 20 years. We'll see if Moore's Law and Nielson's law are continuing to hold, and if so, I imagine the next hard-fork will be much less controversial. Doubling again every 2 years for another 20 years will put the block size at 8 TB, and would allow for ~3 trillion transactions per day. That is certainly enough for every human on earth to use bitcoin for all of their purchases.
And the cool thing is, as long as Moore's and Nielson's laws hold, every single person on earth will still be able to run a full node on a cheap machine. Everyone will have direct, uncensorable access to the monetary system, without placing any trust in corruptible third-parties. That's the vision that excites me.
I think secondary layers like Lightning are much more interesting in what they can do for micro-payments. Putting some trust in a centralized hub for certain micro-transaction purposes isn't so bad. But I definitely don't want to place trust a centralized hub for *all* of my day-to-day purchases.

SHA256 is quantum resistant. Most hash functions are.
The algorithms that are threatened by quantum computing are ECDSA (which bitcoin uses for signing transactions), and RSA (which bitcoin doesn't use, but is very popular for HTTPS authentication, and PGP signatures).

This is frankly awful advice. It will generate a very low entropy password, which will likley be cracked, and result in your bitcoins being stolen. The only "random" elements in it are: 
 * The number Pi (~12 bits of entropy, less if your attacker suspect you are mathematically inclined, and are likely to use pi)
 * Your 2nd postal code (~4 bits of entropy, easy for an attacker to figure out and incorporate it into their cracking)
 * Your cat's name (~4 bits of entropy, easy for an attacker to figure out and incorporate it into their cracking)
 * The 2 "X" values you chose, which are likely each less than 10,000 (~24 bits of entropy)
 * Maybe an extra 10 bits of entropy for the unique combination of operations.
That results in a measly 54 bits of entropy for your brain wallet. It would not take an attacker very long to brute force the private key. (You want *at least* 128 bits of entropy in a brain wallet.)
Seriously, if you're considering making a brain wallet using any techniques similar to this, don't. Just focus on memorizing a strong seed that was generated with true randomness.

I disagree. Right now the largest pool has only 22% of the hashpower, and it would take 4 of the largest pools to collude to get over 50% hashpower. Last year, we had GHash.io alone hovering at 50%.

Majority rule has *always been the rules of bitcoin*. The threat of a hard-fork if the masses don't like what the developers are doing has always been there. Only now, the threat is more real, because there is actual code backing that threat.
The developers that are balking at any increase now have a strong incentive to reach a compromise. I still think a compromise will be reached before the XT hard-fork initiates itself.
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:38:28
The shorter fork will likely die off quickly though. With a sudden drop in hashpower on the shorter chain (effectively 75% of the miners will stop mining), blocks will only be found at a rate of once every 40 minutes. As miners realize that they're mining on the non-majority chain, they will have a strong incentive to switch over, which will further increase block times on the short chain.
Because difficulty only readjusts every 2016 blocks, it will take many weeks (maybe even months) for the difficulty to adjust downward on the shorter chain. And, when it finally does re-adjust, it can only adjust to 1/4 its previous value. So, if may take many cycles of re-adjustment before it can actually adjust low enough to generate blocks every 10 minutes again.
The biggest risk I think is if miners advertise they support XT-style larger blocks, but when the fork actually occurs, they stay on the small-block fork for some reason (this happened with the BIP 66 soft fork). If 1/3 of miners advertise XT support, but don't actually support it, then we may wind up in a situation where both forks have ~50% of the mining power.
Hopefully the Core developers will just come around and include BIP 101 support into Core before the fork actually occurs. It would be much nicer to role out this hard for with near unanimity, even if it is begrudging unanimity.

Because that's just the way that cryptocurrencies work. The mining majority always sets the rules, because that's the only way we know of to create a trustless digital currency.
Currently, the mining majority is supporting 1MB blocks. If someone doesn't like that, but they still want to participate in bitcoin, then they are forced to accept that restriction. (Realistically, I wouldn't use the word "force", because all participation is voluntary).

The actual plot for BIP 101's max block size looks like this: 
This is not a step function. It is described in the code as "Piecewise-linear-between-doublings growth". The code itself for BIP 101's proposed max block size can be seen in the [pull request](
@_date: 2015-08-31 16:28:00
Most likely there will be a warning period, where it takes considerably longer than 10 minutes to crack an ECDSA key, thus giving users a window to safely move their coins to new keys.
However, if there is no warning period, users could still move their coins to new keys if they relied on a trusted miner. The miner could offer a service (for a larger-than-usual-fee), where they promise not to re-broadcast your transaction until they've mined it in a block. As long as the block doesn't get orphaned, and as long as the miner doesn't betray the user's trust, this would work well.
Hopefully there is a nice long warning period though.
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:08:39


BIP 101 itself increases the maximum block size to 8MB, and then increases the max block size every block, with an average schedule of doubling it every 2 years for 20 years, at which point the maximum blocksize will be 8 GB. This is an average growth of 41% per year. Since [Nielsen's law]( posits that bandwidth increases by 50% per year, this growth rate should be less than technology's growth rate, and therefore it should still get cheaper to run a full node as time increases.
The only-bigblocks code implements basically only BIP 101 (I think there is also some rebranding code changes as well).
As for why the other changes are included, I think [this message]( from Mike explains his reasoning pretty well.
I personally would rather see [redacted] just implement BIP 101 for now, but I also don't think that the other changes are nearly as bad as some of the FUD I've seen about them. There is nothing trying to be "snuck" in. They're very open about the additional changes, and the rationale behind those changes.

I'm not proposing majority rule. I'm asserting that majority rule is *just the way it is*. A corollary of this reality is that the Core Developers, or any other entity that attempts to control bitcoin, always will have a check on their power.


Exactly. The Core Developers are too centralized, and their position of "everyone that's loud enough gets a veto" is untenable. Thankfully, the bitcoin system itself has a check on this power.


I'm all for sidechains, and the lightning network. I think they are potentially very cool tech that have the potential to radically improve the overall bitcoin eco-system. However, they are not the only solution to scaling bitcoin.
The fact is, blockchains can scale in line with technological growth, and maintain their decentralized nature. As machine power and network capacity grow, it is practical to increase the maximum size of blocks. Due to the exponential nature of technological growth, this will massively increase the capacity of the bitcoin blockchain.
If we double the max block size every 2 years for 40 years, we will have the capacity to support *trillions* of transaction per day, all while preserving the ability for everyone to have cheap direct access to the monetary system.
This is why I support BIP101 *and* I support sidechains and the lightning network.
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:52:54
The Lightning Network proposal includes a concept of Hubs. You send an initial payment to the hub (e.g. for 10 BTC), which has an automatic release time (e.g. 1 month). This gives the hub the power over your coins for the duration of the release time. If the hub decides that you're a terrorist, they have the ability to lock up your funds until the release time is up.
The hub must also be accepted by the merchant you want to use, or else it is useless to you as a customer. This will likely lead to a centralization of hubs, and governments exerting their control over the hubs. If on-chain fees are high enough that most payments are forced to go through the lightning network, then we are in a situation that isn't much different than today - with companies like Visa and Mastercard deciding where it's appropriate for you to spend your money.

From what I understand, quantum computers have the potential to use [Grover's Algorithm]( to reduce the search space for SHA256 from 2^256 down to 2^128. This is still a large enough search space that the algorithm wouldn't be considered broken. (Although, this is why the NSA is already recommending the use of SHA384).
However, you're right that it might make mining significantly easier, because it would significantly reduce the search space. If I'm understanding quantum computing correctly, then we'll likely have another major revolution in mining as miners shift to using quantum computers. We've already gone through this with ASICs, so I imagine the transition would be fairly similar.

The argument that I've heard is that a malicious miner with a large percentage of the network hashrate may attack the network by constantly pushing the blocksize larger and larger. This will increase their competitor's orphan rate, and eventually drive them out of business. Since they have the largest hash rate, they are less effected by the higher orphan rate. If the block size is large enough, it stands to reason that a single entity will eventually control 100% of the mining power.

When you're talking bits of entropy, you add them, not multiply, because the number of bits is the exponent. E.g. 2^12 + 2^4 + 2^4 + 2^24 + 2^10. So, no, I don't think my entropy calculation is too far off the mark.

You're right that it was a really bad bug, however, I don't think it would have killed bitcoin. We could have recovered from it through some centralized action by the developers (likely by releasing BIP66 as a mandatory upgrade). It would definitely not have been ideal, and it would have set bitcoin back years in terms of lost trust in the system, but bitcoin would likely have survived.
Contrast this with a zero-day ECDSA vulnerability in which the private key is recoverable from the public key. If a vulnerability like this is ever found, a large percentage bitcoin users will have their bitcoins stolen from them (thus allowing thieves to own a large chunk of the coin supply). It will become very difficult to securely spend your bitcoins (creating a transaction reveals the public key of your address), so commerce will completely grind to a halt until a fix is released (and the fix won't be easy - it could easily take weeks to code up the appropriate migration to something like Lamport signatures). The trust in the system would completely degrade. A bug like this would likely kill bitcoin as we know it (it wouldn't kill the fundamental idea of cryptocurrencies though).

I think an appropriate way to think about this problem is to think about how much percentage of your overall investment portfolio you want invested in bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a high risk investment (in a few years, it will likely be worth a significant amount more than it currently is, or it will be worth zero). The younger you are, the more of your portfolio you want in high-risk, high-reward assets like this. Just make sure you have at least 3 months of liquid cash, regardless of your age.

Off-chain transactions, including Lightning, require *trust*. You have to trust that the third-party payment processor won't confiscate you funds (which is still possible in Lightning, just with an eventual timeout). You have to trust that the third-party payment processor won't block you from paying the merchant you desire to pay. You have to trust that the payment processor won't collect or require onerous personal details.
On-chain transactions, on the other hand, are trustless. There is no middleman involved that can censor you or otherwise attempt to control how you use your money.

You have some points, but your vitriol is unwarranted. Constantly replacing Mt. Gox with "mtToxic" does nothing for your argument other than making the source (you) look unqualified.
Now, to address your points:
First off, there's nothing wrong with being a business that is all about money. In fact, if bitcoin can't inspire businesses to be created that are all about money, then bitcoin itself will fail. People don't do things that aren't in their own self interest.
While I agree that a vibrant OTC market is beneficial, there isn't any reason that these can't exist alongside central exchanges.
Ultimately, in my opinion, we should be striving to create a full-on economy that is fully powered by bitcoins. This means that you can *earn* bitcoins, not just buy them with fiat currency. Once you can trade your labor for bitcoins, we won't even really have a need for exchanges. Some people may still use them, but they won't be necessary at all.
In order to get a full bitcoin economy, we need to get bitcoins into as many people's hands as possible. Centralized exchanges provide a great way to do this. Because frankly, there is no way that I would recommend to my family members that they should go an meet up with someone that they have never met with thousands of dollars on them in order to buy bitcoins. That may be alright for some people, but the majority of people vastly prefer exchanges.
I agree that when the powers-that-be eventually decided to attack bitcoin, they will go after the exchanges. Hopefully by then though, enough people hold bitcoins that it won't matter, because we'll have a functioning economy that is outside of their control.

I think this is an interesting idea as an optional extension to bitcoin. I would look into doing this more like the HTTPS Certificate Authority method. So, rather than being granted a private key from Verisign, you get Verisign to sign your public key using their private signing key. This would limit trust in the CA, and also allow merchants to choose which CA's to trust.

I'm glad bitpay finally got a domain without a the dash (it used to be bit-pay.com, which is just much less professional)
I have used bitpay on the customer end, and it is a really great user experience. In my case, the merchant had their price listed in USD, when I went to checkout bitpay presented me with a page that listed the current price in bitcoins, and gave me a customized payment address and a 15 minute window to make my payment. As soon as I sent my BTC to the payment address the page refreshed and said the payment was complete. The bitpay URL is also bookmarkable, which effectively serves as a receipt (I just used the bitpay URL as the label for the payment address in my bitcoin client).
Their fees are a little steep (2.69% if you're converting to USD), but still very competitive with credit card fees. You could build your own solution and just pay 0.6% (assuming you instantly sold the BTC on mtgox), but for a smaller merchant that is just getting started with bitcoin, I think their service is simply stellar.

Market cap is hugely important to the long-term success of bitcoin for more reasons as well:
Increased price brings in more miners, which increases the security of the network against the only real viable attack against bitcoin: a sustained 51% attack.

As long as you don't use your Bitcoin-QT wallet.dat file and only use blockchain.info, it will be fine. If you try to use both though, you will probably run into problems.
You can fix this though by just creating a new wallet.dat file. If you already have funds in your existing wallet.dat it can get a little complicated, but here's what you can do:
1. Send 100% of the funds to your vanity address (they'll still show up in bitcoin-qt at this point, that's ok).
2. Shut down bitcoin-qt.
3. Backup your existing wallet.dat. (Just move it out of your bitcoin directory and into a safe place. You should really never delete wallet.dat files in case you ever need to reuse any of the addresses.)
4. Relauch Bitcoin-QT. At this point it will make a new wallet.dat and your vanity address funds will only show up on blockchain.info.
5. Send as much BTC as you want back to bitcoin-qt (Assuming you don't want to keep too many funds on blockchain.info)

For more in-depth review, read up on crypto-anarchism. The basic premise is that technology will make it increasingly harder for the state to assert its control over individuals. Crypto-currencies are one such technology that allows free individuals to trade amongst each other without the state intervening. Another really exciting technology is 3D printers, which decentralize production.
It is difficult for governments to control every single individual. Instead, they assert their control over centralized corporations, and end up asserting their control over individuals by proxy. As an example, this is why your taxes are taken out of each paycheck. When income taxes were first levied in USA, this wasn't the case, and most people just didn't pay them, or severely underpaid.
Another (and probably much larger) implication is what bitcoin can do to the federal reserve. If serious commerce starts to take place in bitcoin, it will severely undermine the fed and their ability to print money. This is actually mostly how the state funds itself - by going into debt via selling bonds which are bought by the fed.
A really good fictional novel I'd recommend which explores the implications of crypto-currencies as well as things like nanotechnology is "The Diamond Age" by Niel Stephenson.

Honestly, because this is much harder for a non-dedicated team to maintain. This means they have to run their own bitcoind. It also means they have to convert the BTC to USD on their own, and maintain the current conversion rate (unless the business wants to maintain a BTC holding, which is unlikely).
The bitcoin payment services all have APIs that are very similar to paypals, and they do all the above things for you.
Bitpay seems to be the current frontrunner, but Walletbit looks promising too, and offers much lower fees. There's also MtGox Merchant, which offers the lowest fees, but has less features than the other 2.

I don't think its any secret that they are trying to be compliant with US regulations. They are firmly in the camp of "making bitcoin legit", which means working with the regulators, and getting permission to do things.
The other camp is "we don't need any approval to use bitcoins". Localbitcoins as well as bitcoin-otc are in this camp. So are Silk Road and many other agorist websites.
So, this move will surely lose them customers that were using them to buy BTC for ultimate use on Silk Road, but those users should just go through other routes anyway.

The risk/reward formula has drastically changed since 1 year ago. There are many more bitcoin users, so the potential donation volume is much higher. And the risk is lower with the currency being much more established and other big players accepting bitcoin.

This isn't really the same thing. First of all, the time weighting that they use is not a good system. It assumes that knowledge about the outcome of an event is gained linearly, but this isn't the case in the real world. In the real world, new information comes to light in punctuated bursts.
Second of all, and more importantly, your capital is tied up for the duration of the bet. On intrade, you are buying options. So, if you buy an option, and then later sell it, your money is freed up to make other purchases. This is especially bad on bets that have a very long time before the outcome is official.

It's possible that those coins are tainted, and derived from one of the various heists that have occurred (note that I didn't do any research into these coins specifically, I'm just speculating).
MtGox has started a policy of putting accounts on hold if the account has known stolen coins. Therefore, a thief will have a hard time converting their stolen coins back into fiat, because MtGox is the largest exchange. A smart thief therefore may decide to just try to taint as many people's coins as possible. They could do this by just scanning the blockchain for active addresses, and sending them small amounts of tainted coins. The eventual goal would be to get MtGox to reverse their policy because a large percentage of their customers end up having tainted coins. Once they reverse their policy, the thief goes and sells their large cache of stolen coins.

Fair enough - I admit I don't understand the SL culture at all. My main critique was to you even contemplating building an entirely new cryptocurrency just to allow for faster confirmations. That is analogous to someone deciding to build an entire new database system because the current technology just isn't quite right. You'll spend all your time perfecting the technology, and wind up with zero users. In the meantime, someone else will come along, build something that works (but maybe isn't perfect), and take all your users.

Right now the difficulty is still low enough that commerce could be brought to a standstill for a pretty small amount of money. This attack could potentially lead to the demise of bitcoin. Here's the attack:
Buy up a company that builds ASICs, and get them to devote all of their resources toward building custom bitcoin mining hardware. Spend enough money building these ASICs until you have a significant more hashing power than the current bitcoin network (you'll want about double to really make sure your attack works). 
Doubling the current hash rate of the network would only cost around $750,000. Here's the math: The current network hash rate is approximately 25,000 GH/s. A 72 GH/s ASIC from btcfpga.com is selling for $1070, which equals $15/GH/s. $15 * 50,000 = $750,000. Assuming you bought a whole factory, the math would probably be different, but this is at least a good estimate.
Finally, turn on all your ASICs, but setup your software to mine nothing but empty blocks. Don't build off of any other miner's blocks that they find. Since you have double the hashing power of the main network, your blockchain will always be the longest. Transactions will never confirm, and commerce will effectively screech to a halt. You'll be able to sustain your attack indefinitely as bitcoin slowly dies - the price goes down, and the legitimate miners start turning off their rigs.
This is the attack vector that keeps me up at night. I am anxiously awaiting the current batch of ASICs ship. The higher the difficulty, the more expensive such an attack becomes. 
I actually thought this attack would be much more expensive than this - until I did the math with upcoming ASICs and saw how cheap it actually is. Did I make a mistake somewhere? Can attackers really spend just 1 million dollars to kill bitcoin?

I like the change away from "mining", but I'm honestly not sure if another term could stick at this point. I typically gloss over mining anyway when describing bitcoin to brand new users anyway, so I don't think it's that important. I don't necessarily love "bookkeeper", but I will say that if a better term starts taking off, I would definitely start using it as well.
I don't like any of your other suggestions though. Public and Private Key are well defined terms, and typically are decently well understood by the layperson. Wallet is also fine, as long as you describe that it's a wallet *for your private keys*, not for your bitcoins themselves. Calling it "signature store" wouldn't help here, because you'd still have to describe that signatures can only be used once per output.

I think Roger was in the wrong here, but I still respect him because he had the decency to apologize for his actions.
The guy wasn't a scammer. He is just a jerk for not returning money that was accidentally sent to him. But he didn't force or fraudulently get bitcoinstore to send an extra 4 BTC to him. Perhaps the guy simply doesn't want to spend the time to send back the coins (yeah, it would only take a few minutes, but what right does bitcoinstore have to those minutes of his life?). Perhaps he didn't realize that they were sent to him erroneously, and he already spent them. Perhaps he's just an idiot and lost the private key. 
The point is, bitcoinstore has no right to his time just because they sent him extra money. It was *entirely* their mistake. Rather than going on a witch hunt, they should have spent the time to look internally at their own practices that led up to them accidentally refunding &gt;100% bitcoins.

That's fundamentally incorrect. He stole from all of his honest betters. If he had won the bet, all of the honest betters would have sent him the appropriate amount of BTC.
It would be the same as if you went to a casino to play roulette. Say you put a huge bet on red, and then the spin hits red.

I disagree that "Bitcoin is fate".
Cryptocurrency is fate, but Bitcoin itself could still be kept down. The powers-that-be could possibly kill bitcoin and prevent cryptocurrencies for hundreds of years if they so choose. And, once they actually realize the potential of cryptocurrencies, I believe they will try to. The actions we take now will determine the odds of their attacks succeeding.

It sounded to me like he was saying "if the power goes out at my house, I'll lose my bitcoins", but reading his follow-up comments, I see he is indeed talking about a massive world-wide power outage. Of course, traditional currencies are fubared too in this event. He seems to think that there is actual paper backing up all our money, but this simply isn't the case, most money in bank accounts is simply entries in a database.
As far as it being a solution in areas with poor infastructure: as long as you keep backups of your coins (on a USB stick, or a paper wallet), you have nothing to worry about. You may not be able to spend your coins during a blackout, but as soon as you get internet back, you'd be fine. Most third-world countries have decent cell coverage anyway, so as long as you have a cell phone with a charge, you can use your bitcoins.

The only problem with dropbox is that it can get overwritten automatically, and only keeps backups for 30 days. So, if your wallet gets corrupted somehow, you could end up with a corrupted backup as well.
I think dropbox is great as a part of a backup solution, but you should be storing it to at least 3 different places, and at least one of those places shouldn't get automatically overwritten.

Because maybe you don't trust yourself to store your funds securely.
I have many semi-technical friends and family that have expressed interest in buying some bitcoins, but are hesitant because they don't trust themselves to never get a virus or make a silly mistake with their funds. If they could pay a nominal fee to an insured company that could store their coins for them, they'd be on board.

Bitcoin is much easier to move around, and to hide. Even though a single transaction is easy to trace, mixing services are easy to build, and make it very difficult to trace any transactions if you put a modicum of effort into having it untraced. This is fundamentally different than cash, which requires moving large amounts of physical objects in order to hide its origin. It's different than gold because it is possible to carry enormous sums of value in something as tiny as a usb stick.
So, I think without major innovations on tax collection (read: invasions of privacy and draconian laws), the taxman's job is going to get much harder.

No, I don't have a case-study, but it certainly is technically possible. If you have malware on your computer, it is capable of doing anything any program could do.

It's not an either/or proposition - we can do both. We must do both.
If I had to answer your question, I would side with making the process of managing your funds easier. But certain steps will *always* be hard. For example, ensuring your system is virus-free eludes the majority of the population. (There are solutions that that, eg, a cheap dedicated bitcoin router that just runs bitcoind). 
In the end though, no matter how easy you make it to manage your own funds, there will always be those that *want* to trust someone else to do it for them. I want to trade with those people too.
Ultimately, I just want to be able to trade bitcoins with as many people as possible.

This is always my question every time I hear this same sad story. How did it happen?
I suspect the main cause is that the user had some malware on their computer. The malware probably specifically looked for login attempts to mtgox.com, and sent the username and password to a third-party.
I would love to confirm that this is the case though. Specifically, I'd like the OP to let us know:
 * What OS were you running?
 * Were you up to date on all software updates?
 * What browser do you use?
 * Did you have any anti-virus software?
Ultimately, a yubi-key may help. But if you have malware on your computer, even that is not foolproof.

Seeing all these great talks makes me really wish I had been there!
Quick summary for those that can't watch the whole thing (and to help me summarize it to myself):
- We're already seeing alternative currencies throughout the world. For example, people are using Tide detergent and gum sticks as currencies.
- Then, the majority of the talk discusses how broken and fraudulent the existing banking system is:
  - QE3 is a capitulation by the fed that the ability to grow out of the existing financial crisis will never happen. Their attempt to get out is printing, which is the basis of Currency Wars (he referenced the book).
  - We are in so much debt right now, that even if we burned all of our oil reserves in order to increase GDP, we still wouldn't pay off the debt.
  - Wall Street banking commonly practices many fraudulent activities (which Keiser knows first-hand since he spent time as a banker). They think of themselves as above the law, and often get laws modified for them after getting caught breaking existing laws.
  - He discusses his attempt to organize to crash JPMorgan by buying silver, since JPMorgan has a large naked short position on silver (and then he discusses how naked short positions themselves are basically counterfeiting).
  - He shares a good quote from Bastiat, which describes the current system:


- Finally, he compares bitcoin to gold and silver, claiming that it has many of the same properties, including divisibility, durability, portability, and intrinsic value.
I wish he had done a better job describing why bitcoin has intrinsic value. I think this is a common critique of bitcoin by gold bugs. They think of bitcoin as just another fiat currency, since there is nothing physical that backs it. I think a good argument to this is that the inherent value of bitcoin is that it is a decentralized distributed ledger system. The fact that it can resiliently store account balances is itself an intrinsic value.
Overall, great talk. Thanks for posting!

I've thought about this a lot. If I were Jeff Bezos (Amazon CEO), this would be my ultimate plan to give AMZN the most profitable quarter ever. (This plan could probably work for google as well in a modified form)
Step 1: Spend about 3 months buying up as many bitcoins as possible. This massive buying alone will likely drive up the cost of bitcoin, since you'd be driving up demand. This is fine, just keep buying (and maybe even firing up your idle EC2 hardware to mine).
Step 2: Announce to the world that Amazon is now accepting bitcoin. Make sure to make the announcement in the most noisy way possible. Hire the best PR firm available, and make sure this story hits every major news outlet. Make sure you PR paints bitcoin in a very positive light. The world now knows about bitcoin, and is excited about it.
Step 3: Watch as the price of bitcoin shoots up 100x. Congratulations, Amazon is now sitting on billions of dollars worth of BTC. Depending how much you bought in step 1, you are likely now one of the richest companies in the world. Your interests are also positively aligned with the success of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is probably not quite mature enough for this to occur yet, but once it is, this scenario is just waiting for a forward-thinking CEO to execute on.

This place is full of opinions, so I'm not sure what you're talking about :)
I'll offer you mine too! Litecoin is a scamcoin. It offers all the same things as bitcoin, except it uses Scrypt as its hash algo, which means CPU mining is more profitable, which means its much more conducive to botnets. Its creators were jealous of early bitcoin users, and thought they could get rich with no risk by just creating their own competing currency.

Most people know what ledger systems are, at least at a high level. And most people know what the word distributed means. Nonetheless, it's just a launching point for a conversation. Hopefully it spawns useful questions and answers. But, it frames the discussion around the fact that bitcoin is a ledger system, therefore driving questions about that, rather than about less useful questions like mining, or the fact that it's deflationary (not that those aren't useful to know about about, just that they're not really the core concept).

I think the point of this script though is to help with the initial blockchain download, which can take days on end, with the disk *writes* as the bottleneck (or even after a few days of not running bitcoind can sometimes take hours to sync).

Unfortunately, if it does get a code, it'll probably get the code "XBC", rather than "BTC".
ISO 4217 specifies that the first two letters of the currency codes are the 2-letter country code, with X being reserved for non-country currencies (since no 2-letter country codes are ever assigned starting with and X). Additionally, since Bhutan already has the 2-letter country code BT, assigning BTC would be extra confusing.

I recommend using bitaddress.org for generating brain wallets. Their algorithm is simple:

Granted, this generates a hex-encoded private key, which isn't directly importable into bitcoin-qt - but the conversion between the formats is well-documented.
Additionally bitaddress.org is all included in a single webpage which is gpg signed by the author. This allows you to easily save the HTML file, and move it to an offline computer. It also means that even if the domain goes offline, you still have a copy of the software.

The downside to creating an entirely new crypto-currency is that you'd need miners to secure your crypto-currency. Otherwise anyone with some extra mining hardware sitting around can come in an hijack your entire currency.
I think you're overestimating the risk of double-spend on zero-confirmaton transactions. BitPay already operates with zero-confirmation payments of in-person transactions, so you've got them as a working example.
You could limit the transaction size to only a few bitcoins if you're really worried. You said in another post that nothing would stop someone from creating 10,000 small transactions - but I think you miscalculated the fact that it would be pretty much impossible for this person to coordinate with 10,000 different sellers, and make sure that all of the sales happen at the exact time time.

I think this is the ideal long-term solution. You maintain the integrity and scarcity of the blockchain while still allowing a high volume of transactions. Miners would have to agree upon this protocol though, otherwise you'd risk double-spending before the ripple chain gets merged back in.

Google Authenticator is 2 factor authentication. Granted, you're somewhat vulnerable during the setup phase, but this could be done on a separate machine if you're paranoid.

There are many possible ways, but a very simple attack could be for the malware to just wait for a withdrawal request, and then intercept the request and replace the withdrawal address with one that belongs to the attacker.

Listen to yourself! Do you really want to turn people away from using bitcoin? How are you supposed to create a full-fledged economy this way?
You keep talking about history as if it somehow proves your point, but there has never been a burgeoning crypto-currency before. How about you try to apply logic to the current situation instead?
Let's start where we agree: The powers-that-be will eventually try to attack bitcoin. My contention is that if enough people have a vested interest in bitcoin's success (ie, they're holding BTC) at this time, then their attacks will fail because we'll already have a functioning counter-economy that they won't be able to shut down. So, in the meantime, anything that gets bitcoins into the hands of as many people as possible is good.

It sounds like you got the process down pretty nicely. Just make sure your paper wallet is backed up in a few geographically diverse locations - otherwise you're susceptible to something like a fire destroying all your BTC.
Also, if you do end up using Armory to send your coins, be conscientious of what it does. If you only send some of your coins, it will send some to a "Change Address" in Armory's wallet. Since you used bitaddress.org to create the initial address, it likely isn't using Armory's deterministic wallet. Therefore, your coins may end up getting lost if you don't back up Armory's wallet.
I'd recommend practicing sending some coins from your paper wallet. Do it with a small amount (so maybe don't do it with the paper wallet you already made).
In my opinion, the google 2-step authenticator should be just as secure as a yubikey. Most importantly, make sure your computer doesn't have any malware on it when you're dealing with bitcoins.

Here's the Google Translation:
The Bitcoin virus
Support terrorists or drug or buy the stuff but just maybe hoard? With the privately issued Bitcoins the dream of free central bank currency got a boost. As recently told a Bundesbank President Jens Weidmann of the Micronesian islands of Yap, my assets grew by about the equivalent of a papaya. That was probably a coincidence. Nevertheless, these two events have to do for me a lot in common, even if the evidence of the Correlations of is very difficult. What had happened? In his opening address at the symposium of cash Bundesbank reminded Weidmann fact that even today cash is drawn very differently - on the Yap Islands, stone money would be used, for example, mussels in areas of Papua New Guinea. "There is even a shell bank, which replaced the hard shell money in national currency," the Federal Reserve chairman. Just this exotic examples made it clear that money ultimately constitutes a social convention. Oh.
So far, so unspectacular. If it were not for one circumstance which gives the folk entering an Federal Reserve Chairman for me more weight: For some time I wear around something like Shell or stone money with me - on my phone. No euro but called Bitcoin, electronic coins that have emerged at some point in the last three years on any computer anywhere in the world. Private and decentralized drawn, without the intervention of any central bankers. And now the stuff is stored as a file in my e-wallet with the catchy address 1BkwELDBrytAfaVMEBs96fUMx6kqsvGWL6. Only if the want to write anyone.
At the moment, ranging from my Bitcoins to go out to eat once maintained. The FBI, the BKA, the Federal Association of the Digital Economy, BaFin, even the dear colleagues suspect all, I would probably use it to buy drugs, support terrorists to acquire weapons, child porn pay, wash dirty money, or want to evade taxes. This can be ruled out, of course not, but for a start it would do a beer and a cheeseburger.
It sounds like a new sequence from the previously only conspiracy theorists familiar epic "war of currencies", this time the double episode "A New Hope" and "The Empire Strikes Back". Written by Friedrich August von Hayek ("denationalization of money"), and others. In this war, my potential threat to the ruling holds money order with a 4.965 electronic units completely non-political art currency very limited. But the stuff that rests there in my phone could have a longer life than the euro. Because it has properties that make it - make indestructible - almost. It's more of a virus as a currency, and that is now released. I am infected, a bit anyway.
Train for the apocalypse
The story so far: For years, fighting a small, changing but growing band of rebels against the omnipotence of government money monopoly. With so far, let's put it gently, moderately successful. The private competition currencies, they are now called Chiemgau or Liberty Dollar, exhaust themselves either as regional occupational therapies or are even completely cleared by court decision out of the way. At the same time, the advocates of private money competition, Euro-rebel Frank Schaeffler (FDP) for example, or U.S. Tea Party icon Ron Paul, in the public perception rather freak status. And indeed the whole issue of alternative currencies in sometimes suspected to be cultivated mostly by people bunkering also canned foods and exercise for the Apocalypse. Still, as a pure spinning can no longer dismiss the private currency ambitions.
What the whole thing slowly becoming a subject of serious consideration of policy making, I am not the only one who plays with such controlled by any central bank in the world of money. Some take this Bitcoins (and other private currencies) so even really seriously, so seriously that they build entire business models out - from the point-of-sale infrastructure to own Bitcoin credit card.
Because with Bitcoins currency rebels since 2009, a weapon that is far more dangerous than anything that circulated previously as cash alternatives: There is no central issuer of currency, no one of the "responsible" - and you can take by the state in the duty (or set ) could. Only an open source computer, programmed by an unknown person, maintained by a few volunteers. The Bitcoins even flow but in a network of thousands of computers. Who's computer infrastructure available to get, occasionally a few of the electronic coins automatically assigned by the network. Who does not want to acquire, Bitcoins just like any other foreign currency: by exchange, trading platforms or the sale of products and services. The electronic coins are tamper-proof in the current situation, anonymous, and everyone will know that their number is finally up to a maximum just below 21 million units will grow (by the year 2140). Payments - even across continents - cost nothing and are almost as fast and easy as copy-and-paste. Even the frequent reports of thefts Bitcoin and market manipulation, and the warnings that Bitcoins would be used primarily for illegal transactions have, not the currency permanently harmed. After all - what critics usually overlooked - theft, fraud and illegal transactions are not a unique feature of privately issued currencies. But it is certain also: Bitcoins (or any other private currency) may always be so legally, as the law allows.
    More coupon as hedge
The European Central Bank (ECB) is the whole thing yet so interesting that this phenomenon has now devoted a study ("Virtual Currency Schemes", October 2012). Threatened the monetary authorities feel it yet, but the risks must be well now regularly take a close look. The growth of the art currencies will continue for several reasons - more Internet use, more e-commerce, more demand for anonymous payment options, desire to lower transaction costs and faster settlement of liabilities.
A reason that did not contribute significantly to the continued interest in central bank money alternatives that ECB researchers suggest, however: Some might now be giddy at the big money pressure Sause who hold the banks to save the world. There was still something to the store of value function of money, at least in theory, to say the skeptics - and looking for alternatives to fiat money by the central banks.
Gold is - because not in endless supply - a standard response, but one that does not really fit into a time in which one computer with a few clicks you can buy around the world products. For how to send no central switching, clearing or depository institution and with the lowest possible transaction costs, say, 0.083 grams of gold for an e-book download to a seller in the U.S.? Using the peer-to-peer currency Bitcoin all this is no longer a problem.
But where, pray tell, the private Nothing gets on my phone its value? One wonders just who alone on central bank magic or - alternatively - like trust the supposedly everlasting gold. In reality, and has always been: ". Money is what money does" And the more people with nowhere to start something on my phone can, the more it resembles money.

This is the utility as cash for even the biggest hurdle for the Bitcoins. Unlike the more illegal activities, it is still a bit difficult to find uses for the private currency. The number of restaurants, for example, which can be paid for Bitcoins is in Germany still relatively clear: one. And who wants to pay for even one night with Bitcoins, must ascend go to Kleve-Keeken or Rojacherhütte at Sonnblick in Austria, probably highest point of acceptance for Bitcoins.
While in the real world but still lack of acceptance, at least I can on the internet for the Arts money now for some selected dealers wine, cheese, black, baby clothes or handmade natural soap get. But I heard my dear few Bitcoins - more than coupon on an experiment with an uncertain outcome as a hedge against monetary doomsday.

I've discussed this in the other thread where this same thing happened 2 days ago:
2-factor authentication is not enough if your computer has malware on it. If the malware is simply a keylogger, then yes, 2factor will protect you. But if the malware is more robust (and most malware is these days - they typically give your adversary complete control over your computer through a rootkit), then 2factor is not going to save your coins.
Your attacker will simply wait for you to plug in your Yubikey, and then intercept the OTP and instantly issue their own withdrawal request.
Your absolute best protection is to use a computer does not have malware on it. This requires constant vigilance.

I agree that it's safer if you're technically savvy enough to do it *correctly*. I don't agree that it's easier though.
Storing your coins correctly means creating your private keys on a secure machine (preferably one that never even connects to the internet). It means backing up your keys to 3+ geographically distributed locations, making sure you're encrypting your keys with a 256 bit key, and never forgetting the password. It probably also means creating a paper backup in case you do lose the password or become incapacitated.
Those steps are not easy for the average person. Even people that are relatively savvy will stumble on some of those steps. And if you do even one step wrong, you're leaving yourself vulnerable.
So, I'm not saying centralization should be forced. But giving consumers the *option* to trust a 3rd party with the security of their funds is a good thing for the future of bitcoin. Those that invest the time and energy to learn how to store their coins themselves will still have the option - but they'll also have many more people to trade those coins with.

Interesting talk! I loved the early points that he made about bitcoin rendering the state irrelevant. I think I do *somewhat* agree with his hypotheses - specifically that people act in their own self-interest, and therefore the existing banking system is not going to take kindly to bitcoin in the long-run. However, I think there is another path that he's not fully considering:
In the short term, interoperability with the existing banking system is immensely helpful to bitcoin, because it assists in getting bitcoin into more people's hands. If we can get enough people to own bitcoins before the banking system wakes up and realizes that they need to shut down the exchanges, then it will already be a real currency. You won't have a need to have shady OTC transactions for large amount of cash, because you will simply be able to earn bitcoins with your labor, and spend bitcoins at a wide variety of merchants.
This to me is a much better outcome for bitcoin, which is why I think it's prudent to focus on getting as many businesses to accept bitcoin as possible, along with getting as many consumers to learn about it and try it out.

Unfortunately, the majority of users simply have no way to verify fingerprints out of band (how would you even do this for most websites?). Therefore, they will just accept them blindly, which completely negates any benefits of the secure connection. So, for now, we need trusted certificate authorities if we want to have any degree of security on the web.
Interestingly, blockchain technology has the potential to make CA's irrelevant though. Namecoin is planning on storing certificate fingerprints in the blockchain directly (one of the many reasons I'm really excited about the eventual awesomeness of namecoin)

I agree with this sentiment, and I would say that increasing the maximum block size in line with technological growth *is* sticking with the status quo. It's what was done before when the 250kb soft limit was reached and the default setting for block size was increased up to 750kb. I'd say that increasing the block size as a function of time is much closer to the status quo than the introduction of a fee market, or building an entirely new layer-1 payments system on top of bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-02 05:41:24
By the time blocks get to 8gb in size, network capacity (following Nielsen's law) will have advanced faster than the block size has grown. Network capacity tends to increase in capacity by 50% per year, whereas BIP 101 will only increasee block sizes 41% per year. Therefore, it will actually be *cheaper* to transfer 8gb blocks in 2036 than it would be to transfer 8mb blocks today.

I did a [similar analysis]( assuming BIP 101 is implemented, and Nielsen's law stays true for the next 30 years. In my analysis, the initial sync time for the average node rises until 2020, and then actually *decreases* with time after that.

It's also pretty unreasonable that voting for a block size increase requires a higher difficulty. I'm pretty sure this would result in no one ever voting for an increase, because it has a real cost associated with it.
@_date: 2015-09-01 00:15:31
That's quite the false dichotomy you've presented there. All the block increase proposals (including BIP 101 and Sipa's proposal) are set to grow slower than the growth of technology. So, under any of the plans we choose, it should only get cheaper to run a full node as time goes one. Also, none of the plans prevent Lightning and Sidechains from being implemented.
@_date: 2015-09-14 18:53:56
I was curious how this "initial sync" argument applied to BIP 101, so I plotted it out in a spread sheet. In order to calculate the potential blockchain size, I assumed completely full blocks, which will not likely be the case, so the blockchain size will actually be smaller than what I plot here.
For bandwidth, I assume a [12 mbps]( (1.5 MB/s) starting point, but ultimately the starting point doesn't really matter. The more important assumption is the growth rate of 50% per year, which is predicted by [Nielsen's law](

I don't understand why you think $10/month for a server is too expensive. That's pretty much the floor for what a monthly cost for a server would be. If BIP 101 is implemented, this cost will not rise. Due to the growth in technology, it should actually go down in time (although it likely won't get much cheaper than $10/month, because most hosting providers just don't offer cheaper plans).
In my opinion, this is definitely cheap enough to keep bitcoin very decentralized. A large and diverse population of enthusiasts, businesses, and large holders will continue to host full nodes at this price point.
@_date: 2015-09-04 22:42:06
But, by the time BIP 101 reaches 8GB blocks, technology will have massively improved such that it will actually be cheaper to run a full node in 2036 than it will be in 2016.
And by this point, we can still use Lightning network, and Lightning will be able to support hundreds of transactions per person per day. Micro-payments will be a reality, and we'll likely see a massively different type of Internet that is significantly less reliant on advertisements. Imagine your browser being able to transparently pay for the content it consumes. Imagine self-driving cars able to automatically negotiate with each other to pass each other, and micro-pay for the privilege.
BIP 101 combined with Lightning will make for an awesome future.

"Hey mom, some guy is planning on kidnapping and torturing you for my btc. Do you mind if I tell you the password so you can move it for me?" Doesn't sound like the best plan.
You are right that he should get ahead of this though. If he truly does have 300k BTC still under his control, he could try to procure a smartphone in prison, and use the smartphone to move his coins. But, that still wouldn't protect his family from the risk of being kidnapped and tortured. So, maybe his best move would be to simply turn the coins in to the feds. It's not like he'll have much use for them in prison anyway.
Of course, that brings up the possibility that this whole thing is just a deceptive ploy to get Ross to turn over his remaining btc to the US gov't. Threaten him without really threatening him.

It's not "exactly like the blockchain" though. It relies on hubs to interact with each other, and it *does* require a certain amount of trust in those hubs. Hubs have the ability to refuse to transfer payments, and they have the ability to confiscate your funds until a certain timeout is reached. For example, if someone sends funds to a hub with a 1 year timeout, that hub has the ability to confiscate those funds for up to one year.
Hubs also introduce another attack surface to the network which governments are sure to exploit. Because hubs must have an indirect relationship with both the merchant and the customer in order to be useful, governments will have the ability to put pressure on merchants for what hubs they accept. They will likely force merchants to only accept hubs which comply with AML policies, which will in effect force customers to interact with these hubs, because those are the only hubs that are accepted by merchants. This is how the current financial system is regulated, and any new hub-and-spoke models (even if they're based on bitcoin) will likely be regulated in the same way.
Lightning definitely has the potential to be very cool technology, but it is disingenuous to claim that it's "exactly like the blockchain". It has a different set of trade-offs. I just hope bitcoin doesn't morph to a system that primarily relies on Lightning for transactions, because some of the trade-offs are not ideal.

If BIP 101 is implemented, you will still be able to run a full node on your personal computer. Sure, maybe 6 years from now, when the max block hits 32 mb, your current hardware may have trouble keeping up. However, by then, you will likely have upgraded your personal computer for a computer that is significantly more powerful. BIP 101 increases the block size at a slower rate than technological growth, so it will always remain viable to run a full node on your own personal computer, or on a cheap hosted server.

AES-256 is also a 256 bit encryption method, and it old and just as established as PGP (7zip uses AES-256). The major difference between the two approaches is whether you're using a symmetric or an asymmetric key. 
The upside to the asymmetric key is that an attacker would need to have access to both the payload (your wallet), as well as your private key before they could start password cracking. The downside is that losing your private key would now be just as bad as losing the wallet itself. So if you're not doing offsite backups of your private key, then your wallet is at risk. 
So, practically, most users will end up storing their wallet in the same location as the private key, in which case you might as well just be using symmetric encryption.
The bottom line though: if your password is robust, and you're using standard proven methods of encryption, you shouldn't have much to worry about if your encrypted wallet is compromised.

They'll just roll them back in order. In your scenario first they'll roll back your sales for 3, 4, 5, and 6 dollars, then they'd roll back you purchase at 0.01.

This really would be the best outcome. The only sensible solution is to increase the max block size exponentially as a function of time, with a slower growth rate than the expected technological growth rate.
If we want to tweak with the starting size, and the growth rate and growth time, I'd be alright with that. But BIP 101 chose a very reasonable set of values, so my first preference would be to simply merge BIP 101 as-is.

Instawallet seems nice as a way to get introduced to bitcoins in a really basic way, but this part scares me:


This just seems like an awful security model. If you ever go to your wallet from a public computer, your wallet is compromised. If anyone ever even sees the URL that you use to access your wallet, it may be compromised.
Mt. Gox has all the features of instawallet, but with a sane security model. And it even lets you convert your BTC to USD.

I'm starting to believe that altcoin scams are a major reason for stagnation in the bitcoin price right now. Altcoin IPOs have pulled out tens (hundreds?) of millions of dollars from bitcoin. When a scamcoin developer raises 20 million dollars worth of BTC, and then proceeds to dump all those coins to "fund their development", this surely has a negative pressure on the bitcoin price.

Full nodes will *never* be as easy or cheap to run as an SPV client. No matter what, they will require large amounts of disk space and significantly more bandwidth and processing power than an SPV client.
We don't need the network to have more full nodes than SPV nodes in order to be adequately decentralized. It's an impossible goal, and trying to achieve such a goal would be the true path to "squandering Moore's Law". As long as it continues to get cheaper to run a full node, and as long as bitcoin use remains widespread, the network will be completely resilient to any types of attacks that would be based on exploiting the set of full nodes directly.
And by the way, why would you even run a full node if performing even a single transaction would cost you $20 or more? Most likely the average user will be forced to trust a Lightning hub for the majority of their transactions, and they'd so rarely be performing actual bitcoin transactions that they would have no reason to run *any* type of node.

Trendon Shavers (aka piratedat40) had the same delusions while he ran another famous ponzi scheme, Bitcoin Savings &amp; Trust.
Way back in 2012, when bitcoin was trading in the $5-$15 range, pirateat40 [took credit](for some of the crazy price swings (it went up to $15, and back down to $8 over the course of a few days). It's still unclear whether he actually was responsible for the price swings, but we do know that the whole scheme collapsed shortly after. Shortly after the collapse of the BS&amp;T, bitcoin itself rose in value tremendously.

It's interesting that the mempool currently has a backlog of around 90k transactions, and yet miners are still not all creating 1mb blocks. The last 10 blocks, according to blockchain.info:

    378033  BitFury         94.33
    378032  F2Pool          976.44

The average size is only 612.44 kB.
I think this is an important thing to consider when people argue that the current average is well under 1mb, and therefore we have a long way to go before actually run out of capacity. Many miners are simply not going to create full blocks, regardless of what the maximum block size is.

Yup. The banks don't simply decline a transaction if you try to make a purchase with your debit card and don't have enough in your account. Instead they'll happily accept the charge, and tack on an extra 30 bucks or so in overdraft fees. What's worse is that they'll re-order the transactions made throughout the day, so you don't just wind up with one overdraft fee, but instead an overdraft fee for every single transaction you made that day leading up to the accidental overspend.
The entire banking system is woefully in need of competition from bitcoin. If all bitcoin ends up accomplishing is prodding the legacy banking systems into the 21st century, I'll call bitcoin a success. I'll be even happier if it altogether replaces the legacy banking system.

A lot of people think their debit card will simply be rejected if they try to spend more than they have. This usually isn't even an option though. Some banks offer "overdraft protection", which can end up costing you more, because it comes with its own ~4% fees, and it puts you into debt at a high interest rate. It's funny how they don't even offer an option to simply decline transactions that would overdraw an account.

@_date: 2013-03-04 21:20:37
Government intervention mostly likely will come at some point. The question is, will bitcoin be widespread enough to survive at that point?
In my opinion, it is already widespread enough to survive all but the most hostile attacks. As time goes on, and more legitimate businesses accept it, and more people learn about it and hold it, it only gets more resilient. 
I think by the time the government wakes up to the fact that bitcoin is an existential threat to them - it will be too late, bitcoin will have already won.

While it is fearful, unfortunately it's also a sound judgment a very real risk to bitcoin. If the US gov't puts its entire might into shutting down bitcoin, I doubt bitcoin itself would succeed.
But if that does happen, we'll just end up creating a new stronger crypto-currency which will be immune to whatever weaknesses the gov't used to win.
Also of course, every day that goes by without decisive action by the gov't is a day that bitcoin grows stronger. The clock is ticking, and it'll be way too late for the gov't to do anything before long.

It's pretty obvious that this guy is the "first DPR". He coded up the original SR, but then passed the torch to the "second DPR". Unfortunately, he was sloppy with his early advertising (which is probably part of the reason he decided to sell SR), which lead the feds to his doorstep. All the recent evidence they have on him is either fabricated, or cannot be traced back to Ross Ulbricht.
The "second DPR" is laying low until this thing shakes out a little more. I'm sure he's pretty spooked about his servers being hacked.

That's a proposal that is getting tossed out a lot.
It may work, but this chain will never have the security that the bitcoin chain does. It will not be able to ever command as much hashing power as bitcoin, which means it will always be less secure.
In fact, it may not even be able to demand *any* hashing power. Why would miners mine on it? Unless it's also creating a currency of its own, there would be no financial incentive to mine on the chain.
So, now you're not just creating another chain, you're creating an entirely new currency.
And, of course this new chain will also have to have protections from spam. Whatever solution it does end up using for limiting dust might as well just get included in bitcoin proper.

RoR isn't to blame - their sysadmins are to blame for not updating Rails when the patch was released. Almost all software systems have vulnerabilities discovered at some point - the question is, do you upgrade them expediently, or do you just sit on them? It looks like Vircurex decided to just sit on them.
For example, was github hacked after this incident? Was Square hacked? No - because they have a competent engineering team that quickly applied the needed fix. 
Edit: If you read [the thread on bitcointalk]( you see that they had a whole day to patch up their systems, but didn't get to it in time.

Impossible to say really, if you could predict the market, you could very easily get rich day trading.
If you're looking to get into a long position on bitcoin, I recommend dollar-cost-averaging where you buy a certain amount over a certain period (eg, buy $XX a week for the next 10 weeks). Basically, just commit to a buy plan, and execute on that plan. Don't let yourself get emotional over all the swings, and don't deviate from the original plan. This strategy helps you avoid issues of short-term volatility.

Expanding on the advantages for the merchant:
 * **No risk of chargebacks**. It's very common for this market to experience "buyers remorse" after the deed is done, so the rate of chargebacks is rather high.
 * **Significantly lower fees**. If they stay in pure bitcoin, the fees are zero. If they use bitpay, the fees are 1%. Compare this to using CCbill for credit card processing - [the fees are 14.5%](
 * **Potential for much higher conversion rate**. Entering all your credit card details can be very time consuming (especially with one hand!). Copying and pasting a bitcoin address and clicking send is as simple as a few clicks.

Looks like they never confirmed, and the blockchain.info wallet doesn't do too great of a job of re-broadbasting transactions.
Based on the OP's other posts, I assume he still has all his BTC, they're just in his blockchain.info wallet still. He may need to re-import the private keys into a new wallet account, and then he can just respend them.
@_date: 2013-01-06 00:31:15
That won't even solve the problem really. Even making it 10x the currenct size would only allow for 6 million transactions per day, and at that point the blockchain would be growing by 1.4 GB per day. The blockchain simply cannot be used to store all transactions across the world.
One possible answers is "banks" which act as clearing houses. These wouldn't be traditional banks though, because you'd still control the majority of your wealth, the banks would only be used for day to day spending.
Another possibility is a system like Ripple, where you'd only need to clear your debts on a periodic basis.

Yeah, the "get-rich-quick" side of bitcoin definitely rears its head from time to time - especially during price run-ups like we're seeing now. Those people don't likely have the fortitude to hold their BTC for years trough all the swings though. Even though I see the potential for bitcoin to be hugely valuable in the future, I always do try to highlight the risks - less people investing for short-term gains is better for price stability anyway.
I agree that volatility needs to simmer down, but I also think this will just happen naturally as the market cap increases. In the meantime, companies like BitPay which do payment processing, offer automatic instant conversions into other currencies. This is how companies like bitcoinstore.com can accept bitcoin as a payment means for all their expensive consumer electronics, and not have to worry about any exchange rate fluctuation risks.

Colored coins would *still* be bitcoins. They would just have an extra value attached to them by the issuer.
Colored coins are not about anti-theft, or about ruining the fungibility of coins. They're about adding the ability for any organization to attach extra meaning to certain coins.
Here's an example: Satoshi Dice wants to go public. Instead of going to MPEX, they simply sell special satoshi's. They promise that the holder of each satoshi will always receive a dividend payment at the end of each month. (In order to limit the number of raw transactions they send out each month, these satoshi's will hopefully be grouped).
As long as SD remains in business, those coins have a special meaning - *only* because SD has promised to pay a dividend on them. The nice thing is, there is no central entity that controls the trade of these shares.

Bitpay (which they use for payment processing) does on-the-fly conversion  between USD and BTC. Realistically, it still makes sense to price things in terms of USD - especially if a static price results in you charging *more* for using a less risky payment option. Don't punish your best customers!

If you're scared of losing your wallet due to an upgrade, you probably don't have a sufficient backup policy for yourself. Your first priority: back up your wallet.dat to multiple locations. I like to have one on my local harddrive, one on a usb stick, and one on dropbox (just make sure it's encrypted if you're storing it anywhere on the cloud). Also, remember to make new backups often - at least every 100 transactions.

The drama mostly stems from the person/entity known as "MPOE-PR". This entity does the PR for the bitcoin exchange MPEX. The majority of MPEX's trading volume comes from one major asset: SatoshiDice, so it's in their financial interest to promote SD.
Once you recognize this clear conflict of interest, it is much easier to see through the bullshit comments it makes like: "Mike Hearn is the sort of irrelevant muppet nobody cares about.".
Mike Hearn is the Google engineer responsible for writing bitcoinj, which is actually the underlying technology that SD uses to power their system.

Yes, he could use a mixing service to mix his coins. But, the point is Satoshi Dice is not a mixing service. When you use SD, it returns the funds to the same address they were sent from and therefore leaves a trail.
All mixing services currently implemented have a level of trust associated with them. You are trusting the mixing service itself not to keep logs of the shuffling.

Most transactions are well under 1 KB. Also, many transactions use inputs that are aged enough such that they don't require any fees at all. As long as you wait long enough for your transaction outputs to mature (`days * BTC` needs to be &gt;1) , then your coin age will be high enough that you don't need to include any fees at all.
@_date: 2013-11-16 18:53:48
I can't say for sure, but based on the resources my instance of bitcoin-qt requires, I'd say you need at least the following:
- 50 GB of free HD space on a disk with good I/O (SSD isn't really necessary, but a very old slow HD probably won't cut it)
- 1 GHz processor
- 512 MB of free memory, plus another 512 MB allocated to swap.
This will probably be enough to run a full node for at least the next year or so. As the blockchain and transaction volume grow over time though, you're going to need more powerful machines.
Also, note that version 0.8 and above is way more efficient. If you tried running a full node before 0.8 was released, and found your machine couldn't handle it, you may want to try again.

I thought we were talking about Satoshi Nakamoto using Satoshi Dice to hide his fortune, not theft :)


This is a good point you raise. While your coins will always have a direct line back to the originating source, other people will also hold coins that have a direct line as well. This increases the pool of possible people, and therefore somewhat anonymizes you. 
A true mixing service will actually break the chain - at the cost of trusting the mixing service.

If the price of the stock certificate is a significant percentage of the stock itself, that's quite a problem. Satoshi Dice has 100M shares of their company. Under the new patch, it would cost them over 5,000 BTC to issue their shares as colored coins. This is something like 20% the value of the company.
Why not just make it more expensive to send small outputs around? It's silly that they're using a binary function for the fees, when they could easily just make the function have some sort of granularity to it.

I'm not sure why you'd really need an "Investment Club" just to buy and hold bitcoins - but maybe it could offer some benefits in that less technically savvy users could allow more savvy users to securely store their coins for them. (I for one would never allow this though).
As far as risk assessment: It depends a lot on who you talk to. In the most optimisitic scenario, if the market cap for bitcoins gets close to the market cap for gold, then bitcoin will be valued at something like $100k/BTC.
And, on the pessimistic side: It could easily fall to zero. If a fundamental technological flaw is found, if the government finds a way to shut it down or attack it, if a competing crypto-currency is invented that has fundamentally better properties (maybe one that doesn't require mining?). All these scenarios could lead to the collapse of bitcoin.
Also, there is a third possibility: That it nestles in nicely with the existing financial system. It competes heavily with Western Union, and possibly Paypal, but it never fundamentally replaces these companies.
My opinion is that one of the first two outcomes are the most likely. Given this - I would classify bitcoin as a very high risk/high reward investment. I think it has a positive expected value, but I wouldn't recommend investing more than you're willing to completely lose.

That's a really good point. It makes the process much easier for you, and it even makes you less prone to be accused of favoring a certain miner.
The only thing you have to consider, is that step 1 ("160 random bits") isn't the best, because you can't really prove they are random. It would be better to use 160 bits that are well-formed (eg, all zeros, or a certain string of text). This makes it more verifiable that they are destroyed, and not just sent to a private key that you happen to know the hash of.

From the looks of it, your blockchain wallet password has been compromised. So first I would reset the password from a computer that you *know* is not compromised. If you don't have a known secure computer available, then download an Ubuntu live CD, and install it to a USB stick, and then boot into it from your laptop.
It would be good if you could theorize about how your password got compromised, so that you can take the right steps to secure yourself. Did you run a java applet recently? Did you install some shady software recently? Did you jailbreak your phone ans install anything onto it?
If you're ultra paranoid, then it's probably time for a complete re-install of all your software. It may take a long time, but once you've done it, you can breathe easy again.

Not every transaction requires a fees. If you wait long enough, then your coins will acquire enough "coin age" such that you can make transactions for free.
I foresee a future where common users simply spend their coins at a slow enough rate such that they pay *no* transaction fees. Whereas, businesses will have expenses, and will therefore have a business reason to spend their coins relatively quickly, which will require paying transaction fees.
Therefore, we'll see businesses paying the majority of bitcoin transaction fees, just as a cost of doing business. This will allow everyday users (as long as they allow their coins to age) to continue using bitcoin and paying no transaction fees.

I don't think this is entirely true. I higher difficulty means the network has higher security against 51% attacks, which can result in more confidence and therefore a higher price.
There is also a correlation the other way: As the price rises, more miners are encouraged to enter the market, which in turn drives up the difficulty.
The point is, price and difficulty are interlinked with each other. It's not a direct causation relationship, but there definitely is subtle correlation between the two.

It's funny, because MPOE-PR does make some good points. The poster asking them to de-list S.Dice was ridiculous, and MPOE-PR's response is good:


But then it goes off on the deep end:


inability and ineptitude of the de facto dev team. These problems are a. that users can not create arbitrary size transactions up to the size of one full block ; b. that the client does not correctly select the best possible combination of available inputs to feed a list of arbitrary outputs
I'm not even sure what poiint it's making with (a), and (b) is only really true *if the client is filled with dust outputs*. I'm sorry that the bitcoin developers aren't coding up a Satoshi Dice client - they're coding a bitcoin client. If you want the transactions output algorithm optimized, do it yourself! They're busy solving bigger problems, like introducing bloom filters in order to deal with the ever-increasing size of the block chain (which in itself is a subsidy for SatoshiDice).

The paper wallet store the private keys to your bitcoins. If you ever want to spend the coins that have been send to the public address, you will need the private key in order to sign the transaction. So, effectively, you are sending them to yourself! Congratulation, you truly own your bitcoins.

Holding hard assets, such as bullion, bitcoin, land or other wealth producing capital, is the best defense against hyper-inflation. However, it may not be enough: anonymity is also very important.
If the government knows how much wealth you have, they will come after you during a hyper-inflationary period. They did this in 1933 when the confiscated gold.

The reason you're only right *for now* is that as time goes on, more and more of the economy's supply chain will be able to be purchased in bitcoins. As the number of people and businesses accepting bitcoin continue to rise, the need to convert your BTC to other currencies will go down. At that point, the price of bitcoin won't be backed by the willingness to trade it into dollars - instead it will be backed by te willingness of merchants to accept your BTC for valuable goods and services.

So bitcoins will rise in value so much that they become worthless? Ok.
More specific debunking: Take the author's prime example of the home loan. He is assuming that you want to buy a house that is valued at 4262 BTC, and you have a yearly income of 1278 BTC. In a deflationary environment, your yearly income would go down, but so would the cost of the house.
Assuming a 6% rate of deflation, after 10 years this house will only cost 2442 BTC (math: 4262×.94^9). Let's assume you were responsible during that time, and saved 25% of your income. Even without investing your savings at all, you'd still have saved up a total of 2457 BTC (math for this below). More than enough to buy the house outright.
*Personal savings, assuming 25% savings rate and 6% yearly deflation:*
    Year  Salary   Savings(25%)
    0     1278     319.50
    1     1201.32  300.33
    2     1129.24  282.31
    3     1061.48  265.37
    4     997.79   249.45
    5     937.92   234.48
    6     881.65   220.41
    6     828.75   207.19
    8     779.02   194.76
    9     732.28   183.07
        
    Total savings: 2456.87
Try owning a house outright in 10 years in an inflationary environment, it's simply not possible. Even if you got a 6% raise every year, you'd still have to find a place to invest your savings somewhere that was able to consistent earn at least a 12% interest rate (assuming a 6% rate of inflation rather than a 6% rate of deflation).
It's clear that a deflationary environment is *better* for the average person. It allows you to retire earlier, and not rely on debt.

Well then let's work to ensure there aren't any bugs in the protocol, or at least understand what all the quirks are so that we can implement them correctly.
If we get to a point where no single bitcoin implementation has over 50% of miners using it, then we are immune from your scenario. If a fork-causing bug rears its head in one of the implementations, then there will be a fork, but it will only affect a minority of users, rather than affecting everyone like it did in March 2013.

So, this means you have to hold debt if you want the transaction to confirm quickly. You're not only holding counter-party risk in the entity that issued the debt, you're also holding counter-party risk in OpenCoin to continue operating and maintaining their closed-source product.
The transaction speed problem (which isn't as big a problem as you make it out to me) can be solved in the bitcoin space with green addresses. You're still holding counter-party risk in whatever place you're holding your BTC (eg Mt. Gox), but that's it. The other party also receives real BTC automatically after the transactions confirms.


Here's the problem I see with this: I don't see any of the current exchanges implementing Ripple, because it directly cuts into their business model of collecting a percentage of each trade. So, for Ripple decentralized exchanges, you'll probably wind up with a large amount of small players with very thin margins. This turns into a complicated web-of-trust problem, which I'm not convinced Ripple has solved.
I don't know, maybe Ripple will be useful as a decentralized exchange system, but that's about it. And, in the long run, we hopefully won't need exchanges any more anyway.

You don't need to keep *everything* in memory, mostly just the indexes. And, you're right that there are tons of optimizations you can do to reduce the memory usage (ie, right now blkindex.dat is 1.5 GB, but my bitcoin instance is only using 150 MB of ram, so clearly bitcoind is already pretty good about its optimization).

Yeah, that *may* work if you are fast enough. But, since the main bitcoin client doesn't support this out of the box, you have to have a secondary wallet or account set up and ready to go which has the same private keys as your main wallet. 
Also, the second transaction will likely not propagate the p2p network, because the main client doesn't support transaction replacement. So, you have to manually broadbast the transaction to all the major pools yourself and hope that they either haven't seen the original transaction yet (unlikely, unless you are *really* fast), or will replace your higher fee transaction in their mempool (also unlikely, because this is non-standard behavior).

I'm torn on this issue. Sometimes I think like you guys - but I think that's just because I'm a creature of habit, and I've always looked at USD/BTC price, so why change?
On the other hand, I am incredibly surprised at how many people I've talked to just don't understand that you can buy less than a full BTC. If quoting the price in mBTC becomes more common, it will go a long way to alleviating this common misunderstanding.
Another point is that stock splits happen all the time - and for good reason. People (and markets) are irrational and seeing a lower price helps with certain mental barriers.
If mBTC is the detault on bitcoinity, us old-timers will still be able to switch it back to BTC, but all the newcomers getting in will quickly get a lesson in bitcoin divisibility - as long as it's very obvious that the price being quoted is USD / mBTC :)

This article is a good primer, but I think the number one thing to keep in mind is *Know your Audience*.
For example, in many casies. I completely disagree with the advice to not call bitcoin a "crypto-currency". If you're talking with someone who knows what a crypto-currency is (because they've read Stephenson, or are just technically minded), then it makes absolute sense to call bitcoin what it is!
Also, if you're speaking with someone that is libertarian minded, then it makes absolute sense to speak about how bitcoin has the power to render the state completely irrelevant. Bitcoin's power to enable freedom is one of its greatest assets.

I doubt your friend connecting to your wifi would have caused any issues. It's also possible that you simply had a weak password perhaps? I'd be surprised if someone waited a week to try to attack you.
Regardless of exactly what happened, a little extra paranoia for now can't hurt. Just change your password from a secure computer, and then re-install the OS on your laptop.
Your iPhone and iPad are *probably* secure, especially if they're not jail-broken (I haven't heard of any malware on those devices). So you could even change the password to your wallet from one of those if you can't find another computer to use.
I'd also recommend moving all your coins over to a completely fresh blockchain.info account. Better to just start completely fresh at this point.

The bitcoin price is very volatile right now, and it probably will be for a long time to come. But eventually it should stabilize as it reaches widespread adoption and merchant acceptance.




The easiest solution is to just sell the bitcoins for dollars. But, I agree with you that this doesn't really benefit the bitcoin economy as much as it could, and it doesn't make sense to do this if you're trying to transact with other businesses in bitcoin.
One other solution though would be to buy and sell futures contracts on the price of a bitcoin. This doesn't require a business to actually sell the BTC into dollars. Companies that deal in foreign currencies already do similar risk management techniques, so it seems reasonable for them to adopt similar practices for managing bitcoin risk.

Entropy is just how many guesses an attacker would need to make in order to find your password. It's typically represented as the number of bits. (e.g. 8 bits of entropy would take at most 2^8 guesses).
So, to calculate the entropy of an 8-character alphanumeric password, you just take 62 (the number of possible values for each character in the password) and raise it to the 8th power (since there are 8 characters total). Then convert it to base-2. So:
62^8 =~ 10^14 =~ 2^47 == 47 bits of entropy. 
If you don't want to convert to base-2, then a good rule of thumb is:
10^20 =~ 64 bits
10^40 =~ 128 bits
10^80 =~ 256 bits
If you're generating a passphrase, then you can't just use the number of characters in your phrase, because you'll be using whole words (which can be found in a dictionary). Instead, just use the number of words in your pool of candidate words. A good rule of thumb is that you'll be pulling from a pool of approximately 32,000 words, which means each word will add 15 bits of entropy to your passphrase (since 2^15 == 32768).
One final note is that the above calculations will typically over-estimate entropy because of the fact that the characters and words you choose typically won't be fully independent. (eg, certain words are more likely to follow other words, and an attacker can exploit this fact). That's why it's a good idea to randomly generate your passwords with a true random number generator, rather than just relying on your own mind, which isn't very good at being random.

I skimmed over the Zapcoin paper, and it does seem interesting. I'm not sure if a non-proof-of-work consensus based system ever would actually work, but I love to see attempts, and the Zapcoin proposal seems like a pretty good one.
I see one of the open questions is:


I would propose that with a new currency like this, the initial funds should be seeded by the holders of bitcoin at a pre-announced specific point on the blockchain. This solves a critical problem for consensus based systems, in that it helps ensure funds are widely distributed amongst a large amount of people. It also incentives current bitcoin users to get involved, because many of they are automatically holders of the new currency.

I hope we never go down the route of building additional protocols for this. A much better solution would be to just find a sustainable fee structure that allows for *any* transaction, as long as it contains the appropriate fees. Whatever other protocol we built for relaying transactions would have to do the exact same thing.


This is the same as it's always been (meaning the 0.8.2 change doesn't affect the way these fees are calculated). This can be resolved incrementally as the coins are spent by just always including 1 small input along with a second larger input. The default client pretty much never does this though. A much better solution would be to fix the input choosing algorithm in order to clean up the dust, rather than just completely banning dust.
Don't throw the baby out with the bathwater, as they say.
All that said - as much as I'm arguing against the core developers in this thread, I do understand that it's very difficult problem to create a DoS resistant network. I hope this ends up being a minor bump on the road to a better solution.

Welcome to the wild west! I think all of your criticisms are spot on. Fortunately, a lot of the problems you see should get better as time goes on.


This won't get any easier, IMO (too many regulations in the legacy system). The thing that will get easier though will be *earning* BTC. This is the path forward to a true BTC economy anyway.


This is only getting better with time. For example, take a look at bitcoinstore.com, reddit, wordpress, 4chan, and namecheap. As the number of people holding bitcoins rises, the motivation for existing companies to accept it also increases.


We're most definitely still in the wild west phase. It's an unfortunate aspect of humanity that there are scumbags out there. This will get better though as more and more legitimate businesses crowd out the scammers.


I think this is a great business opportunity as bitcoin matures. I would happily pay a nominal fee in order to allow me to have some leverage against an unknown merchant. If a new business doesn't implement this, I can see companies like BitPay or CoinBase adding an escrow option at some point.


It hasn't been too volatile lately! But, I am sure we will continue to see wild swings in the years to come. This can be mitigated by hedging (another service that a company could offer). Also, it stands to reason that the volatility will go down as the market cap increases.

One reason not to re-use addresses is because of quantum computing. When quantum becomes a reality, then Shor's algorithm can be used to crack the ECDSA private keys of addresses that have been re-used. Shor's algorithm can't be used on addresses that haven't been used for sending before, because the actual public key hasn't been exposed before, just a hash of the public key. Shor's algorithm works on ECDSA signatures, but not on hashes of the signature.

BofA is one of the largest banks, and benefit greatly from the status quo (e.g. they were large recipients of TARP money).
However, this article does give me hope about BofA. Maybe they have some smart people in management that realize their only hope of surviving as a company is to embrace bitcoin rather than battle it. We're still going to need centers of trust after bitcoin gains widespread adoption, and the firms that exist as "banks" today would fill this role perfectly.

Awesome! The more full nodes on the network, the better.
To get started, download bitcoin-qt here: 
bitcoin-qt is basically the same as bitcoind, it just also provides a graphical interface.
Once you've downloaded it just boot it up and wait for it to "Sync". This process may take more than a day.
I recommend that you first encrypt your wallet (Settings -&gt; Encrypt Wallet), you can do this before it's done syncing. After you've encrypted your wallet, back it up (File -&gt; Backup Wallet), and save this backup to at least one offsite location (e.g. keep a USB stick for yourself and keep one at a friends house).
Running a full bitcoin node helps give you the best security for your coins. When you use a light node, you are placing some trust in your peers to not lie to you about the state of the blockchain. When you run a full node, you don't have to trust anyone else.

Yeah, that would be amazing. It would allow for merchants to effectively "Add fees" to a transaction that was having trouble confirming. 
It would also allow for a true market for fees to form, because rather than just paying what you hope will be enough, you can pay the minimum amount you think it will take to get accepted into a block, and then effectively *increase your bid* later on if necessary.
I think the developers are working on this, albeit slowly and deliberately. Transaction fees are a very complicated aspect of bitcoin.

Firstbits work by scanning the blockchain for the first address that received coins that start with that set of bits.
So, you could (rather easily) generate another address that starts with "1cmhcz", however this new address would not match "1cmhcz" for the firstbits, because the OP's address is in the blockchain at an earlier point. The new address's firstbits would necessarily be longer than just 6 characters.

Difficulty *does* impact the price.
One year ago, it was entirely feasible for a rogue entity to spend something like $1m-$10m in order to fabricate a few of their own ASICs and launch a sustained 51% attack on the bitcoin network.
Now, the cost of fabricating enough ASICs to launch a successful sustained 51% attack is significantly higher (probably around $100m).
The cost required to launch a successful 51% attack is very important, especially for something as disruptive as bitcoin (since there are many governments that would happily spend a few million to squash something like it).
Now, I don't know exactly how they are correlated (I'm sure some advanced economic papers will eventually be written exploring this topic), but unless you completely ignore the "security of the network" aspect, then it is clear the difficulty does have an effect on the price of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-07-23 03:41:22
The rise of asics won't kill bitcoin. The value in bitcoin isn't in how they're generated, it's in what you can do with the bitcoins that have been generated. Decentralized, irreversible, nearly instant transactions - that's where the value lies.
If I were you , I'd focus on earning bitcoins through other means (eg, trading your labor or other things of value for BTC), rather than focusing on mining.

This is a different type of fraud than what bitpay is referring to. They're talking to merchants, and saying there is zero risk of consumer fraud (ie, chargebacks, stolen credit cards, etc.).
I do wonder how they'll handle this case though. Is protecting consumers from merchant fraud part of their goals? This is something bitcoin sorely needs, but I'm also not sure if this would hurt their value proposition to merchants.

It's a default in the program. Make no mistake - the developers have a bully pulpit, and they are enacting policy in this decision.
I agree that they should be able to enact policy in this manner - but they should think things through and make sure they are enacting the *correct* policies.
If enough people disagree with their default, we could create our own fork. But frankly, that type of division is unhealthy at this point. It would be much better if we could find a solution to the dust transaction problem that doesn't step on so many toes.

It's good you are mostly debt-free, but I had to do a double-take when I read this:


LOL. That's like saying "I have no other wounds except my chopped off leg". Personally, I think debt-based home "ownership" is one of the largest financial blunders the average american makes. You're signing up for 30 years of debt, and eventually paying more than double the price for the most expensive purchase you make in your life.
That said, I think you're wise to take measured risks in order to free yourself from this debt. My only qualm with your plan is that you seem to just be assuming bitcoin will hit $3k within a year. There is a long road ahead of us still, and we very may well see sideways or downward movement for a very long time. I prefer to think in much longer terms than 1 year out. Bitcoin has world-changing potential, and that potential probably won't be realized in the timeframe of just 1 year. Remember, in 3 years the block reward will halve once again, drastically limiting the supply of new coins.
Whatever you choose to do, good luck on the path to financial independence!

Another possible option is an ETF-like business entity. This business entity would have a charter to do nothing but buy bitcoins with all available capital. This could allow their current investors to buy shares of this business entity and then gain exposure to bitcoins.

It's not anonymous. If you buy bitcoins from Mt. Gox, and then turn around and spend those bitcoins somewhere, Mt. Gox could feasibly see exactly what address you sent the bitcoins to. If it is a known address (eg, the WikiLeaks donation address), they could effectively know exactly where you spent your bitcoins. 
You can take measures against this by just sending your bitcoins to an intermediate address before spending them. This give you plausible deniability at least. 
If you want to use them truly anonymously, your best option at this point is to send them through a third-party mixing service.

That transaction is dependent on a previous unconfirmed transaction:  
To see this yourself, go to the [original transaction on blockchain.info]( and click on the "Show scripts &amp; coinbase" link. You will then see "Output" links next to the inputs. Click on the bottom one (the one for 0.99999839 BTC) and you will see the previous unconfirmed transaction.
It looks like  contains zero fees, which is likely delaying the confirmation. It looks like it should eventually confirm though, because it does have a high enough priority to get included in the free transaction space. However, it looks like didn't have enough priority when you first sent the transaction, which is the reason for the delay.
At this point, all you can do is wait and hope. If you were using bitcoin-qt, I would recomend you to leave the client open so that it could re-broadbast the transactions, but I think blockchain.info will take care of re-broadcasting for you.

It's not 800k per month, it's 850k per quarter. And, considering the market cap is $500m, I do think it's possible.
Also, consider this: Mt. Gox's sell volume per day is on the order to 30k BTC. That's over $1m in BTC sold per day (I'm sure some of that is day traders buying and selling, but stick with me here). If just a tiny percentage of those BTC sales went to tangible goods on bitcoinstore.com rather than dollars, they'd hit their target with no problem.

Colored coins is an incredibly cool concept that allows completely decentralized stock exchanges. The same thing that bitcoin is doing for money can also be done for stocks and other assets.
Now, we could create an alternative chain just for managing colored coins, but then it wouldn't be backed up by the full hashing power that the bitcoin network provides.
I completely agree with the developers efforts to limit dust transactions, however they're going about it the wrong way. Rather than a floor on the minimum transaction, how about an inflection point, where fees start getting exponentially larger? (E.g., the fee for a 10 satoshi output could be 0.01 BTC, and the fee for a single satoshi output could be 0.1 BTC).
In this way, it would still be prohibitively expensive to spam the blockchain with dust, but it would still allow property transfers to occur between 2 parties that agree.
What they're doing instead seems like a lazy hack.

It only dropped 10% from its temporary peak. It was only over 19 for a few hours.
Volatility is certainly a risk, but it can also go the other way: the bitcoins could appreciate in value during the exchange period. Presumably, if you have a longer-term business relationship, this variance would even out over time. Sometimes you'd come out ahead, sometimes your supplier would come out ahead, but in the long run, it'll be even.
Also, 10% is not unheard of for international money transfers, once all the middlemen have taken their cuts. This is one area bitcoin has some serious potential to disrupt.

This is one of the most ridiculous justifications for insider trading laws. Why is "participation" so important? If we can't engage in stock trading without forcing a large number of people to stick there head in the sand and pretend they don't know something, then maybe it's an activity we shouldn't engage in.
Perhaps you're right that non-insiders would be less likely to day trade stocks. But, there's no reason why reason why long-term investors wouldn't still participate. If you're planning on just buying and holding an equity for multiple years, then what does it matter to you if the big price changes happen one day before earnings announcements rather than one day after? It doesn't matter, because you're not trying to time the market, you're just hoping the company continues to succeed over the long haul.
So, in the end, we have a bunch of thought crime laws with onerous requirements, and these laws only help a very small set of the population (day-traders). These laws are protectionist laws, pure and simple.

How is it solvable, and what changes would be required of PPCoin in order to make this possible?
Ideally it would be possible to still store the majority of coins in an offline cold-storage wallet, and only periodically sign certain strings using those coins (hopefully not *too* often, because each time you boot into your cold-storage machine, you are taking a risk). Even better would be if you could just pre-sign something before storing your coins, and this pre-signed message could be used for all future proof-of-stakes, and therefore not require you to *ever* break out your coins from cold storage - unless you actually want to spend them.

I'm honestly not sure either way. I really wish they'd be more transparent about the situation though.
Genesis Block did a good analysis:  which leads me to believe there's at least a good chance they're fractional reserve (at least in USD).
Also, the longer they have these awful withdrawal delays, the worse I fear. It's been nearly 6 months now, and they still have significant withdrawal delays. I don't understand why they're able to send up to $1000 at a time, but not more. I also don't understand what they mean when they say they're "manually processing" withdrawals. It sounds like they're just trying to buy as much time as possible using whatever excuses they can come up with to not send USD out of their system. This is the same thing ponzi schemes and governments do (in the form of capital controls) when they're out of hard currency.

The impact this has on colored coins is literally the biggest issue with this change. The fact is that outputs smaller than some arbitrary limit are *completely invalid* transactions now, no matter how large a fee you include (as soon as the majority of the network upgrades, your transaction simply won't be relayed - don't count on any significant percentage to change the defaults).
If they wanted to make this change more palatable, they could allow for small outputs to still be valid as long as it included a large enough fee.

Part of the attack is to also use a Sybil attack, which sets up many false nodes in order to delay the propagation of new blocks on the regular chain. This could potentially allow the attackers to publish their "secret block" moments before the legitimate block is published (thus making sure that the rest of the network's mining effort has been wasted).
Regardless of the inflammatory title of the paper, it *is* an interesting combination of 2 known attacks (dishonest miners plus a Sybil attack). The main problem is that it completely ignores wider economic incentives. However, regardless of the problems, it still might end up making sense to implement the paper's suggestions (which is for peers to just rebroadcast all known chains, instead of just the first they saw). So, don't hate on the paper too much - in the end it might just end up making bitcoin stronger!

That said, I am definitely wishing you guys success! I think if you can manage to solve this problem correctly, you'll prove that the volatility is a manageable problem with the correct risk-management strategies.
@_date: 2013-03-23 04:15:43
You are completely correct.
It's funny though, because even though I lived through it, and was actively trading during the bubble and crash, a year later my ape-memory still thought that the hack caused the crash. I had to go look at the charts and the news stories and verify the timing in order to come to the same conclusion as you: that the price was already down to $17 when the hack occurred. It's strange how our brains re-order past events that are associated.

BitStamp is an exchange which maintains and order book and allows you to buy and sell coins, including placing limit orders.
Coinbase is a webwallet, which also allows you to buy and sell coins, however they just use BitStamp for buying coins themselves, and they only allow you to place market orders. Coinbase does charge a higher fee (1% vs ~0.5%).
If you're in the US and you plan on just buying and holding, then Coinbase is pretty much the best option. They're easy to use, they have reasonable fees, and they're a US company.

It's been said many times: If you don't physically own the gold, then you don't own gold, you just own IOUs.
Now, the lesson here is that **the exact same thing is true with bitcoin**. If you don't own the private keys to your bitcoins, then you don't actually own the bitcoins. This is true if your BTC is being held in Mt. Gox, Coinbase, or any other shared wallet service.
These services are fine, just be aware that as long as your BTC is cashed in to them, there is always a counter-party risk.

What you're suggesting would help solve the overall size of the blockchain. However, there are other issues when considering large blocks. Every transaction in the block needs to be verified, which requires CPU cycles. There will also be memory requirements which increase as the block size increases. Finally, there are issues with bandwidth - you need to be able to broadcast the block out to the network in a reasonable time.
@_date: 2013-01-22 22:12:15
It depends what the flaw is.
In order to roll the blockchain back, you'd need cooperation of the majority if miners, which I doubt would happen (because you'd also be rolling back all the legitimate transactions that occurred during that time). It may not even be a benefit to do this if the flaw is something more fundamental.
Hopefully any flaws that do exist are found well in advance of their practical application, so that the change can be rolled out in an orderly manner. Most cryptographic flaws are found in this way. For example, SHA1 is considered broken - but only because the search space for a collision has been reduced to 2^80, rather than the full 2^128. So, even though it's severely hampered, and you shouldn't use sha1 for new applications - existing applications aren't *that* vulnerable, because 2^80 is still a huge number.
The worst flaw I can think of is if ECDSA is found to be trivially crackable. If that happens, you may wake up to find a large amount of your coins missing. Once these thefts started being reported, you'd see a mass sell-off, and basically the collapse of the currency. Then we'd see another crypto-currency (which fixed the ECDSA flaws) take bitcoin's place.

The fact that bitcoin is part of this freedom movement is not a bad thing.

So, why not make the defaults to the new nMinRelayTxFee be 0 for now? This still gives miners and users the ability to raise the nMinRelayTxFee size if they believe it should be higher.

No, it's fine. You really shouldn't buy things you don't need just because you happen to have the money to afford it.
It's much smarter to save for the uncertain future, so that in the event of troubled times, you have the resources you need to avoid hardship, or even to save your life.
Of course, current monetary policy rewards anti-saving behavior, and incentives you to *go into debt* to buy things you don't need. This makes you a wage-slave. If something bad happens in the future, you are completely helpless without some "benevolent" government that comes in and saves you.

@_date: 2013-05-27 10:57:52
Here's my feedback:
* Take security seriously from day one. Remember that security is an ongoing process. You already have a few minor things that should be fixed right now:
  * You should upgrade your version of nginx. 1.1.19 has some [vulnerabilities]( You should also configure your server to stop sending the X-Powered-By header, IMO.
  * It's good you're using HTTPS. It protects against a man-in-the-middle attack where the attacker poisons the JS. However, you should add the Strict-Transport-Security header, which forces clients to connect over https on subsequent requests.
* I think it's a little strange that you're just using the blockchain.info API and polling every 10 seconds (although I suppose it does save you a lot of work). It does seem like you're only making these requests when the tab is visible, so that's nice at least. Can you confirm that you never send the private keys to blockchain.info either?
* I think it would be a good idea to unobfuscate your javascript, and include it all inline with the page (similar to bitaddress.org). The unobfuscation would increase confidence that there isn't anything shady hidden in the code, and making it all inline would allow your users to save the page and therefore be immune to javascript injection attacks.
Overall it looks pretty good! I'll be keeping an eye on this project.

Oh, that's good. It looks like you based this heavily off of bitaddress.org, which is great. It would be cool if you also redirected to an html page that included the sha256 hash of the page in the title of the HTML, and signed the hash with your private gpg key (the same way bitaddress.org does). This would make it easier to save the HTML for offline usage.
Also, you shouldn't really be including any off-site JS - including Google Analytics. That is another avenue for attack.
Finally, it would be much easier to analyze the code if you didn't include obfuscated JQuery and Bootstrap JS. It would be the absolute best if you just didn't include jQuery or BootstrapJS at all - but if you must, at least leave them un-obfuscated.
And overall, nice work! Please don't take my security concerns too harshly - but do know that they are important if you want other people to depend on the private keys that your code generates for them.

Well, see, it's strange, because they seem to define "speculating" as both high-risk *and* not based on true fundamentals and analysis.
This is a strange coupling, and I think it's why the difference between speculating and investing is the same as the difference between hoarding and saving. One is a derogatory term, and one isn't.
For example, if you would have bought bought facebook shares in 2005 (if the SEC didn't make this illegal for non-rich people), would you have considered this investing, or speculating? It's clearly high-risk, but they also had solid growth and strong network effects (i.e. "fundamentals").

Well, I guess it depends how centralized you want mining and the blockchain to be. At 1.4 GB per day, the blockchain is growing by 500 GB per year. All of the indexes for the transactions have to be kept in memory. All of the transactions have to be verified for their ECDSA signatures, and to ensure no transaction outputs are being double spent. So, even at this point, you'd basically need a very expensive computing cluster just to validate the blockchain. It would be way worst at 100x (14gb/day plus the memory and CPU overhead).
I personally would rather keep the blockchain accessible. I'd prefer the trade-off of using Ripple or a third-party for small day-to-day transactions rather than being forced to trust a third party with the block chain itself.

It really shouldn't ever take a full day for a transaction to confirm as long as it has paid the proper nominal fee. I'm sure if you looked into your transaction that took 24 hours to confirm, you'd see that somehow it was sent with less than the standard fee. As bitcoin becomes more popular, it becomes even more important to add the proper fee to transactions.
So, I'm sure non-confirmed transactions will be an edge case they'd have to consider for same-day deliveries. But, basically, if the customer fails to include the fraction of a penny fee for their transaction, then it's their own fault, and they'll have to expect a delayed shipment.

The thing is - the revolutionary aspects of bitcoin are a great reason to get in to bitcoin. 
When someone asks why bitcoin is special, you could mention the fact that value transfer is fast and transaction fees are low - these things are pretty cool, but not all that much better than paypal with a verified account.
However, if you really want to explain why it is special: the fact it separates the state from money, the fact that no third parties are needed to verify any transactions, the fact that it will put the bankers out of business. These things are what really make bitcoin special.

It's a well-produced news-clip style video that focuses on how bitcoin micropayments may eventually pose a real threat to paypal.
Sending small values is very difficult to do for a payment company like paypal, but bitcoin does it effortlessly. The addition of `bitcoin:` URL scheme to the HTML5 spec is a sign that it may be used more and more for micro-payments on the web. If paypal does adopt bitcoin themselves, they'll have to forgo the lucrative 2-5% commissions they currently charge, which will cut into the greedy executives' paychecks. Therefore, paypal is probably lobbying congress right now to protect their current business model.
In my opinion though, Paypal is a great candidate to adopt bitcoin as a payment option. In fact, they don't charge 2-5% for every transaction: they already allow ACH payments for free (which they are certainly taking a small loss on for each transaction), so bitcoin is an even cheaper option.
PayPal was originally founded as a company that was supposed to enable a lot of what bitcoin is currently empowering (ie, cheap p2p payments across the web). Unfortunately, they're a centralized entity, so, they've been forced to adopt a lot more regulations as time went on. Maybe they'll be interested in adopting bitcoin as a way to truly realize their vision of low-fee international p2p payments.

I don't think passive loans will be profitable in a post-bitcoin world.
If bitcoin succeeds and becomes the main currency of the world, then the value of bitcoin itself should grow in value with the rate of growth of the economy, meaning it will grow in value 2-3% per year (as opposed to losing 2-10% of its value each year in the current inflationary system).
This means making a profitable loan will be much harder. If the party you're loaning to can't create enough value fast enough to beat the 2-3% risk-free rate you might as well not make the loan. Therefore there will be significantly less opportunities to just loan out your money and make a return. You'll see lenders working hard to seek out and find the best loaning opportunities, and then actively working with their lendees to make sure they're doing the right things (eg, mentoring the lendee's business, providing the right contacts, etc). Lenders making active investments will actually produce something of value with their time, rather than just sitting back and doing nothing to benefit society.

The entire concept of an "accredited investor" is a complete farce. It is completely obvious that these laws are nothing more than a a protectionist measure to ensure that the most lucrative investments are only available to those that are already rich.

Meh, I'm not a big fan. It still uses upvotes as a major factor in how they sort comments, so you still wind up with a feedback loop of sorts.
I like to be able to rescue comments that have 1 or 2 downvotes by  giving them an upvote, which I might otherwise have not given them.
Also, when just lurking, it's also nice to be able to see feedback about what the community actually thinks of certain comments. And unless you remember to come back later, you lose out on that aspect of the conversation.

Not what I was implying at all. I think it's actually quite a tragedy that these hacks keep happening over and over and over. I hope the market starts waking up and realizing that top-notch security is a *necessary* investment early on, as well as a *necessary* ongoing expense.
Basically, if you're starting a bitcoin web business, and you don't have at least one employee dedicated to security, you're probably doing it wrong.

This is an innovative service!
Getting people a secure setup for their coins has been a big hurdle for me when introducing bitcoin to new people. I always have them take so many additional steps that feel very paranoid, and I'm sure many people end up doing some very insecure things with their coins, such as downloading potential malware on the same computer they store their coins.

That suggestion is specific to diceware, which selects its passphrases from a pool of 7776 words. So, each word would add about 12.5 bits of entropy. If you're choosing your own passphrase, you'll likely choose from a larger pool of words. However, you'll also likely not choose completely independent words (eg, certain words are more likely to follow other words in a regular sentence).
Also, that suggestion implies that 90 bits is secure enough, which I don't think is the case with brain wallets. You want them to be as close to a full 256 bits as possible, with an absolute minimum of 128 bits. This is because the encrypted data is completely public in the blockchain - there is no physical security at all, and therefore anyone and everyone may be bruteforcing your keys.
So, given the above suggestions, I would choose a passphrase that is at least 7 words long, and also add about 15 random misspellings, numbers, and punctuation. The words will add about 105 bits of entropy, and the other components will add about 150 additional bits of entropy. You should add more words or punctuation if the words of your phrase aren't independent.
Of course, this will be really long, and hard to remember, so you probably should write it down at first. Once a month or so, try to recall the passphrase. This will slowly burn it into your long-term memory. Look at it as a paper-wallet that will slowly get upgraded to a brainwallet.

Bitcoin is not in the ISO standard, so XBT isn't official anyway. BTC sees *way* more usage, so it is effectively the real standard abbreviate.
Personally, I think XBT is silly. There's no X's in the name, so why have one in the abbreviation? Just because some standards body decrees that nation-states are the only ones that get a sane currency code doesn't mean we have to listen to them.

Relax. The dev team is definitely not "umming and arghing about it".
Gavin has been working hard on smarter transaction fees for the 0.9 release ([code here]( This doesn't instantly solve the block size issue, but it is a great first step. If this code can result in an increase the min transaction fee for transactions with a very low coin age (Eg satoshi-dice transactions), then they'll free up a ton of space for more legitimate transactions.
Secondly, there has been plenty of discussion on the increasing block size. If you want to see it for yourself, go to the "[Development &amp; Technical Discussion]( section on bitcointalk.
So, calm down, take a step back, and quit being so nervous about the value of your investment going down. And, if you are still nervous, get involved!

Here's my argument why it doesn't matter. I'd love to hear your counter-points:
The bankers already have all the power. They have the ability to continuously siphon off wealth from society through their control of the money supply. If bitcoin becomes mainstream they no longer will have the ability to siphon a percentage of everyone's productivity. Even if the bankers start with all the wealth they're going to have to either produce something of value or deplete their wealth as they spend.

Yup, they're really attacking the tor network itself at this point. Hopefully this leads to improvements in the tor software, which leads to a more resilient network.

First off, most of what we know about the attack at this point is speculation.
However, from what I've read, there are ways to stop this attack, however it may require fundamental changes to the Tor Hidden Service architecture. This may mean that software updates to Tor itself have to be coded, and then a large number of Tor routers will need to upgrade. This process may take months.
There's an article they recently released about the updates they need to make to make Hidden Services more resilient:

You have to base your pitch on your audience. There are so many facets of bitcoin, and the unique benefits that may appeal to one person may not appeal to all. 
If I'm speaking with someone that I know is libertarian leaning, then I will focus on the fact that it is genuinely sound money whose supply cannot be manipulated. It's also pseudonymous, and payments cannot be stopped by the government.
If I'm speaking with someone that is interested in practical benefits, then I focus on the lower fees and potential for international money transfers. The lower fees can have a real impact on low-margin businesses that end up paying a larger percentage of their margin to the credit card companies.
If I'm speaking to someone technically minded, then I talk about how interesting it is from a technological standpoint.

Just as a point of clarification - the bitcoin protocol doesn't use AES at all. The only cryptographic functions it uses are the hashing functions SHA256 and RIPEMD160 as well as the asymmetric encryption function ECDSA. The client-side wallet encryption may use AES (not sure), but that's completely independent of the protocol itself.


I don't see how 10 minute confirmation times would have any ill-effect on same-day delivery. In fact, it should help immensely, because once the transaction is confirmed, there is absolutely no chance of a reversal, unlike credit-card transactions which may be reversed for up to 60 days after the point of sale.


I completely agree.

Maybe this is why Satoshi chose secp256**k**1, instead of secp256**r**1 for use in bitcoin. If the NSA had an influence on the "random" number chosen, then secp256r1 may be compromised.
secp256r1 is much more common, and there was some debate in the early days as to why Satoshi chose secp256k1 instead: 
The "k" stands for "Koblitz", and it means that the constants of the elliptical curve are chosen in such a way that certain important calculations can be substantially sped up. These optimizations aren't really being used by any bitcoin nodes yet, but in the future these more advanced methods may be important in scaling the network. Additionally the derivation of the "Koblitz" constants my prove to be a  better "Nothing up my sleeve" method than the supposed "random" numbers chosen in secp256r1.
In conclusion: Satoshi had great foresight.

The other concern with blockchain.info is the fact that (by default) they use a single public key for all your transactions: all your change is sent back to the same address. This is really bad privacy-wise. You can resolve from their interface this using custom transactions, but it's a much more tedious process.
I understand they don't want your wallet file size to grow too much, but I wish they'd find a way to resolve this.

HD wallet stands for hierarchical determinstic wallets. Deterministic wallets can generate unlimited addresses from a single secret. The hierarchical aspect allows you to create multiple different chains of these deterministic wallets. This allows "wallets which can be shared partially or entirely with different systems, each with or without the ability to spend coins."
Electrum already uses deterministic wallets (this is why you can just memorize 12 words and then recreate your wallet if necessary). But, no major clients have implemented HD wallets yet.

Thanks for the insightful comment. I think store-of-value is one of the major use-cases for bitcoin, which is often completely overlooked.
Pretty much anyone with substantial wealth will want to have their portfolio diversified over a wide range of assets in order to mitigate the risk of total loss. Bitcoin is the an excellent store of value, because it's an asset that you actually own. Most other assets (eg, stocks, bonds, numbers in your a account) are actually just IOUs, and therefore carry a counter-party risk.

I don't think this is entirely true. A higher difficulty means the network is more secure against 51% attacks, which means the price should likely go up. It also represents a larger capital investment in the underlying infrastructure of bitcoin, which should also cause a price rise.
The relationship between price and difficulty is very complex, and I'm sure at some point, some great academic papers will be written on this relationship
