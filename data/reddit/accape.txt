Maybe the clients creating the transactions had just different system times. The timestamp on the transaction does not matter. In Example 1 the second transaction was included 2 blocks later, so it happened after the other regardless of timestamp.

More hashing power in the network decreases the block time, rising difficulty increase it so it averages around 10 minutes. The exact block time is random.

Sorry, didn't realize the ELI5 somehow.
Each bitcoin transactions consumes outputs that were previously generated by another transaction (it uses them as input) and splits their combined values into a set of new outputs. When mtgox creates a transaction they need to use some of their available outputs as inputs. Now they can remember which outputs they used for a withdrawal request and if that output has already been spent on the blockchain they know the transaction went through, as well as its new txid.

The transaction id is the hash of certain parts of the transaction. Not all of these parts are part of the signature for the transaction, so a 3rd party can modify those details and thereby change the txid. Inputs and Outputs however are signed and can't be changed and a sane exchange should check those instead of txids.
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:45:08
They just need to watch which transactions happen on the network and store a list of all unspent outputs (which is what every full bitcoin node does anyway). Now if they fulfill a withdrawal request and they use 2 inputs (let's call them a and b) and the counterparty claims they didn't receive anything they just need to check wether a and b are still in the unspent outputs list. If they aren't the transaction happened and the transaction that redeemed them is the modified one.

You need to hash over the binary representation and not over an ascii one. On unix like systems the correct way would be:

No, there is no connection between the old and the new outputs except that they share the same script. In the bitcoin protocol the concept of addresses does not exist. It's just an abstraction for the user.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:51:08
One difference is that a hack into the store's DB is something you usually don't expect. Bitcoin however is a trustless system, which means that everything that's not signed should be treated as unreliable information. That includes transaction ids.

You need to generate a new private key. Send the coins to that address. Generate a transaction with NLockTime that gives them back to you in the future, sign the transaction, keep the signed transaction and delete the private key. Then when the lock has expired you broadcast the now unlocked and signed transaction to the network.

The output script cannot be modified because it is part of the signature. You can only modified the the script that is executed before the output script. I think you can modify a transaction in a way that it becomes invalid but you cannot not change where the coins are going or where they came from.

This is a myth. A majority of miners alone can't decide this.

On the other hand if the bitcoin users and exchange decide that new rewards are necessary a majority of miners can't stop them because they will simply ignore the blocks built on top of the rules of the old chain.

Change addresses are not part of the protocol (even addresses themselves don't exist in the protocol). The protocol does however say (and always has) that every output must be spent completely and because you don't want to give all your coins to miners you send them back to yourselves.

A hash function is just a function that maps data of any length to data of a fixed length. In bitcoins hashes are used to assign id's to blocks and transactions. The problem here is that the hash also uses data that is not part of the necessary signatures for the transaction. Because of this a 3rd party can now still change this fields and thereby changing the hash without breaking any of the signatures. The transaction still happens, but badly designed systems that rely on checking txids fail to recognize this.

Difficulty is designed to adjust every 2 weeks. This is done by adjusting every 2016 Blocks. If difficulty were to drop 99.9% block time would increase 1000 times. Assuming were in halfway to the next adjustment it would take 1000 weeks (17 years)

I think change is always sent to the receiving address. This is the address displayed in the "Balance" tab. You can change it by selecting a different address in the "Keys" tab.

Basically it is a function that takes any data as input and gives you a fixed length output. Additionally it is not reversible, you cannot get back the data from the hash, and changing the input even a little will change the output completely. A different use for hashes is storing user login information (don't use this in this form though). You don't want to store a users password in a database so it doesn't get compromised during a hack. Instead you store its hash. When a user now tries to login you compute the hash instead and compare with the database.
In bitcoin we use those hash to refer to a transaction instead of always using the entire transaction information. If any details of the transaction get changed the hash changes as well. This ensures that transactions cannot be changed without changing id's. It doesn't however say anything about who created this exact transaction because anyone can compute the hash.

Bitcoin Days Destroyed is a measure of the transaction volume of Bitcoin. If someone has 100 BTC that they received a week ago and they spend it then 700 bitcoin days have been destroyed. If they take those 100BTC and send them to several addresses and then spend them then although the total transaction volume could be arbitrarily large the number of bitcoin days destroyed is still 700. (taken from blockchain.info)
@_date: 2014-03-01 01:03:36
Yes, either that or a very large number of just recently moved coins. But because they the normal transaction volume on that day wasn't higher than usual, it must have been some very old coins.
@_date: 2014-02-27 13:50:49
You do need to get verified if you want to withdraw or deposit fiat currencies, so I wouldn't say they're anti-kyc. And most exchanges that only deal with cryptos don't have any kyc/aml systems.

There is no such thing as overlapping blocks. There is only one valid blockchain and all blocks that are not part of it are invalid.

@_date: 2014-04-04 07:13:14
Looking at the source code of Bitcoin Core it seems that the client considers all blocks invalid whose first transaction isn't the coinbase. So either the reference client implements the wrong protocol or the wiki is wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:05:43
I'd just wait another block. It's been 45 minutes since the last one and maybe that miner wasn't aware of your transaction yet.

And why do we need a faster transaction time? With bitpay and alike purchases are almost instant anyway.
Also the confirmation power comes from the time passed, not from the number of blocks. If 100 blocks per hour were mined, you would need 10 confirmations to be as safe as now with 1.

I don't think you can do this. You can use your cryptsy deposit address as the withdrawal address for btc-e, but it takes a few minutes for btc-e to do the transaction and cryptsy requires 3 transactions before you can use your btcs there

@_date: 2013-12-09 20:29:10
I'd recommend modeling the API similar to how mtgox does it.
One API which lets you query the current state (current price, ask, bid, relevant part of the order book) and one API which informs you about state updates (depth_changed, a trade happened).
btc-e for example only allows the former but the second api can be created by analyzing the difference between two timestamps. I've already created such a "meta-api" for a private project of mine that does exactly that (although it's still pretty buggy). Of course you can only do these updates at the rate the exchange allows.

@_date: 2013-12-02 21:12:46
Every exchange i know requires at least 2 or 3 confirmations before you can use your funds.
BTC-E requires 3, but from my personal experience it takes actually a little longer (~50 minutes)
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:30:24
I second that. Write the API in plain C and make a C++ wrapper. C Code can be easily called from pretty much every platform.
@_date: 2013-12-09 20:10:52
If you do something like this please make sure that you can use ever API as a streaming api. Unfortunately most exchanges don't offer this directly but it's not really hard to add that layer on the client side.

Personally I've already paid with btc several times and will continues to do so. This is just what I think keeps other people from doing the same.
Of course one can buy new coins now at the current price and use them to make the purchase. What I meant was it can be discouraging for people who buy coins specifically for a purchase on the next day and in the night a 30% drop happens.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:27:29
Yes, but because those people holding most of the bit coins probably want maximum profit they are not gonna sell them in a way that will hurt the price too much.
And if they don't sell the coins their gonna use them as a currency. What's the point of having 10000 BTCs if you don't do anything with it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:45:27
Because in the bitcoin finance world the eur usd exchange rate is around 1.25 but in the rest of the finance world its around 1.36. This is probably because getting usd out of gox is harder then getting euros out and so people are willing to get less euros for dollars. And because of the high trade volume of mtgox, the other exchanges follow its ratios.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:46:57
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:41:45

Assuming by coins you mean currencies based on a block chain, the only benefit I see here is that at least the government that creates it is going to accept it.
As for the downsides, I don't see any reason for any country to accept coins invented by a specific government.
Also I don't see why any government would want to do this. If it is block chain based they have as much control over it as they have with bitcoin and if it's not blockchain based it's something completely different anyway.

Instant Order is probably a market order.
When you sell, it fills the highest bid order, then moves on to the next (now) highest bid order until all your coins are sold. Unless you are selling a lot of coins you probably won't be selling much under the current price.

What I'm saying is that if I buy 100$ worth of bit coins today, there's a chance I can't use those to buy something worth 100$ tomorrow.
Another example:
I buy 100$ worth of coins today. The price drops 10% overnight and now i purchase something worth 90$ in bitcoins. I've now basically paid 100$ for the 90$ object. 
Now I can of course just buy 90$ worth of bitcoins at the current price but that means I invested 100$ into bitcoins that I didn't even want to invest.

Let's assume your income is 1 BTC per month. In the next month the value of bitcoin increases by 20% and you now get another 0.8 BTC. The value of bitcoin increases once again by 20%. Now you use some of you bitcoin (0.1 for example) to buy something. Now the question becomes: Do you have to pay 40% taxes for capital gain or 20% ?

The mining of blocks will continue even after 2140, it's just that each block will generate 0 satoshis. An it won't happen sooner than 2140 because if computing power rises, the difficulty will increase.

Why would you want to sell for usd. Every coin traded in btc-e can also be directly bought for btc.

But wouldn't it take months for the new miners to get the necessary hardware to be able to fillup that 95%? And if you use solely cpus and gpus to fill that void you would need a LOT of new miners.

Is there any pool that can pull this off? If I were a part of a pool and my pool starts doing such things I would leave this pool and so would many others. In the case of a real emergency the rest of the bitcoin community can still fork the blockchain.

Not sure what you are trying to accomplish here.
Upon receiving, should I transfer them to some other address? 
That depends on what exactly you're trying to do. If you're running a business and have different addresses for different customers you might want to send them to your normal wallet.
What is the best way to keep track of people's money?
What people? If you mean customers, use different addresses for everyone.
Should I backup wallet.dat?
Yes. No matter what you are trying to do always backup wallet.dat.

Unless your clients already have some connection with bitcoins this will be a big problem. Getting a larger amount of coins for the first time is a lot of work, If these payments happen more often a small discount might really be a good idea. As for how to declare those payments, that depends on where you live.

Yes, it can happen. A 5 second block was mined not to long ago.

Yes, in 2140 the last satoshi will be mined.

If there are enough buy orders for you to sell your bitcoins, then the exchange has the necessary fiat holdings. Everyone that creates a buy order has to have the necessary funds at the exchange to do so.

Works fine for me but I've already read about this problem here yesterday so you're not the only one.

If you only need simple constructs such as interface you can just use such simple tricks as
struct IFace {
void (*do_something) ();
void do_something (IFace * obj) {
if (obj -&gt; do_something != 0) obj -&gt; do_something ();
else assert_not_reached ();

This also gives you the advantage that you can usually charge 5-10% above gox and people will still buy locally.

Why don't you just look at the order book right before you sell and decide on that basis?
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:14:03
The fee system doesn't need to change. Just people need to start using lower fees. If everyone uses lower fees the miners will have to use those low fee transactions

I've never withdrawn fiat from btc-e, so I can't say for sure, but I assume it's like with all the other exchanges. Scan of passport and a utility bill (or proof of residence). Where you deposit the money to is irrelevant I think.

If they want to maximize their profit they probably are going to sell them in smaller amounts. Sell, let the price recover, sell again and so on.
If they want to damage bitcoin by bringing down the price this will attract a lot of buyers and recover. If bitcoin went down to 10$ I'd buy 100s of bit coins.
But as far as I've heard the gov is usually doing an auction for such things.

This is of course a purely hypothetical example. An event like that could only follow other extremely unlikely scifi-like scenarios (e.g. zombie apocalypse).

An important step would be for governments to announce how to properly tax bitcoins. In a lot of countries it is very hard to pay taxes on bitcoins properly atm because noone really knows the legal situation.

As a business owner you can always use a service like bitpay if you want a guaranteed exchange rate.
As a customer maybe i don't have to pay for a credit card and deal with credit limits and alike. Also personally I think bitcoin payments are a lot easier than cc payments.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:01:14
Until you have something that actually works, this is just another highly unlikely hypothetical scenario.
