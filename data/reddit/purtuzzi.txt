That's a pretty hot topic between us at the moment. She empathizes with pro-separatism (or whatever you want to call this), but ultimately believes HK is, and always has been (contemporary Asia), Chinese territory. She also believes it's in Trump's interest to see HK independent for trade benefits (honestly, I believe it too). We both strongly condemn any violence involved. I don't know what to think, really. I get that HK wants to remain fully "in control" until 2048, as per the agreement between Britain and China. HK, like Macau and Taiwan, feels totally different than being on mainland (I haven't been to Taiwan, actually) because they are different. Government, banks, commerce, trade agreements... It's different. Hell , Macau feels like you're walking in a super wealthy area of Portugal. Mainland China has funded lots of what HK has become and HK gets sweet trade deals (i.e. super low taxes) from mainland. China, and legally so, feels entitled to HK. HK feels they are not entitled to such premature actions, citing 2048 (or even at all). I don't think mainland China needs HK as much as HK will need China in the future. HK is struggling compared to Shanghai, Shenzhen, Guangzhou, etc. HK's housing is insanely high (to be fair, so is housing in most major urban areas of the world), but it is HIGH. HK could probably be successful without China, if they keep demand with imports/exports, and develop more real estate in an attempt to create more affordable housing. China will survive with or without HK (or the US, for that matter).

Your source (you, apparently) seems to be a little misguided. My girlfriend (from Guangzhou) and I (history, politics, social science teacher who has focused on Asian culture and history) are shaking our heads at your subjective sentiment. China has 1.4 billion people, the vast majority whose occupation and way of life is not included in your rhetoric. If you've been to China (I'm assuming you have, based on your assuredness), you should go back again and really get involved within Chinese culture. It is fascinating. Albeit, just as no country is perfect, same goes for China.

This. Perpetual growth is unsustainable, especially with finite, non-renewable resources.

Oh man, I was just having fun! It was a silly Will Farrell movie quote.

Second place. Which means last place. Because if you're not first, you're last.

"...a scary of the roller coaster"?

That's actually not true, and based off of outdated information.
"The US leads the pack with over 2,625 nodes, followed by Germany and France with 2016 and 698 respectively. Incredibly, these three countries are responsible for over 50 percent of all operational Bitcoin nodes."
China and Canada have around the same (~400). Far from the majority.
