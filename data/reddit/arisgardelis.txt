In a perspective, it's going to be good, cause they're going to loose a lot of money. I am just checking the Korean market that's stuck at sellling for 10min or more. Let them drown in their own BCH ...

Its not a matter of communism or capitalism. These are anscient distincions. Its a matter of power. Greece for exaple has capital controls since 2015 because their leaders wanted to control the public sector by appointing each partys voters. This is what we are trying to do with bitcoin. To get back the power that they took from us.

Still the answer is no. China has great control over the CNY. If they see a flow of CNY in or out of China they will stop it. This also defeats the purpose of using bitcoin from Chinese people who want to transfer money outside China. They currently are not allowed to make huge transfers of money outside China because their bank wants full control of their money. This is why bitcoin is so popular there.

Guys, take a chill pill. This price was a new record some days ago. Hitting the 5k was just another milestone from the many to come. loosing 20% in just a few days from the record high of 5k is NOTHING compared to previous 50% to 80% at the previous years. Just take a look or put your graphs at 1week, to see that it's just a small dip compared to the previous ones. Bitcoin is in fact in the most stable phase in years.
My advise. Don't panic. DONT do calculation on how much you've lost from the 5k, because selling at any price right now may make you loose real money, and not profits when you've bought at 1k or 2k or even 3k. The big guns of hedge funds who are playing with money for years are just starting their game, and this was just a test. If you start selling, you just play their game. Just hold your position and you will not loose. What goes up, goes down, but then up again. Correction or no correction, this is how bitcoin fluctuates and this is just a minor loss. Educate yourself and don't be greedy and gains will come in time.

Whats your verification tier?

Quantum mining will not just pop up. To get an estimation of the transition, just take a look of the mining from cpus to gpus to fpga to asic and hopefully to quantum computers. The transition is not sudden, but a battle on how's got the most money and influence and access to technology. So, don't expect sudden collapse of the mining business.

bitcoin, but settling the amount is like trying to pay with gold for a whiskey in far west...

No, I don't work for kraken, I am trying to help.
Please elaborate. What problem did you have sending BTC into a BCH address? Did you do that on purpose or by mistake and what was the outcome?
Sending bitcoins to different chain will definitely create some problems and in worst and most likely case, if you send from a BTC segwit wallet to a BCH address, the money will probably will be lost forever, or at least when the BCH chain will implement segwit, which will be never for the moment.
To slit your coins, you should first make a BTC tranfer to another BTC address and then import BTC wallet seed to a BCH wallet and then transfer them to Kraken.

It just happened for around 550 Bitcoin...
Ok, what should we expect and be cautious? Because I don't think this kind of games are in our favor....
For example, do we expect a big dump around 4000?

Any news why it's down again?

This question and similar "quantum" questions are going on forever in the short life of bitcoin.
Indeed that's a good question, but all of you people who asking this fancy question, do not spare some time to ask "what's a quantum computer" first, before shooting the "BIG" fancy question.
We already have "samples" of quantum computers, but we are far from understanding them or making them do what we want.
We don't have a timeframe on when a full functional and verified quantum computer will start working, and trust me, bitcoin will be one of the last things that a quantum computer will be working on. There are greater problems awaiting to be solved than using exclusively one quantum computer to "break" or "destroy" bitcoin.
 When and if a quantum computer will exist, we will have plenty of time to adjust, and if you did your research before asking, you can see some wallets or companies using cryptos that makes it difficult to crack even with a quantum computer. 
 I am young, and I hope I will live to see a fully functional quantum computer, but we are far from that goal yet. Please spend some time to search and educate yourself on quantum computers and then, you'll figure out yourself what can or cannot be done. Cheers.

 CNY itself. To open an exchange you need the cooperation from banks. And what banks have? They have plenty of access to their local currency. Opening an exchange outside China makes it difficult for the exchange to have liquidity in CNY. Lets say that you have an EU exchange like kraken and you get a massive influx of CNY. What are you going to do all this CNY inside the EU? Or the opposite. Your customers want to short bitcoin for CNY, where are you going to find sk much CNY to send them? This is why most trade platforms usually  trade on their home currency and then USD or EU which is better accessible.

Ok, I'll buy you now @ 2001usd, and you'll get a profit.

Sell me your BTC now  USD and you won't have to worry....

Did you try to sell 0.0000001 BTC? I was scared as hell to even try, in case my BTC was screwed up. The strange thing is that for a split second, I saw some trades at this price...

Check if you sent BCH to a BTC address.
