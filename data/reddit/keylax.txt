1. No, never tell your passphrase to anyone, and keep it offline. It is to recover your wallet. To transfer funds you use the public key of your wallet. But like the op said, if you plan on holding for a while, you dont even need the wallet installed because when you do want to send btc from it you can reinstall it and recover your funds using your passphrase, even from a different / new phone. I would suggest creating a wallet like mycellium your phone and test it out by sending a small amount from coinbase to your electrum wallet and back. Just so you can experience the process yourself.
2. Idk, i dont own eth

Yes they are lost forever. And because there is a limited supply of btc these lost coins contribute to the value of btc. Just like gold, if a chunk of the available gold in the world were to disappear, the rest of the gold still in circulation would definately increase in value.

Do you use a hardware wallet? Im a newbie to bitcoins, is it a decent plan to buy from quadrigacx and store on ledger nano s? Im thinking about long term.
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:38:34
Yes.To clarify, I kinda know what bitcoins are, im just a bit confused as to how they are acquired/managed
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:54:05
Youre right i dont know much, im sorry for not having an innate understanding of the bitcoin. I will leave this gentlemen club and come back when im an expert on the subject so i can have a conversation at your level of intellect.

Surely you got a wallet and picked an exchange before buying though.  And after buying, you still needed to make sure it was secure right off the bat. How could it truly be secure if you just bought and THEN worried about it?
