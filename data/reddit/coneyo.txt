Ding! Ding! Ding!
I understand why everyone wants to believe that it will keep rising, but at this point it should start to be obvious that the price won't keep rising indefinitely if it doesn't start getting used as an actual currency.  At some point, people will look back on this and laugh, and then about a generation or so later another tulip spike will hit.

Have the deaths of the three different hits been confirmed?  That was some really interesting reading.  I'd like to be able to find out more.

If I understand it correctly, coinbase is who jonzer is buying it from.

Because a return is how you measure your net gain.  1000% fluctuations doesn't mean jack if it goes up 1000 and suddenly down a 1000.  1000% in a few months doesn't do shit for someone if after 5 years it drops that 1000%.

I imagine the only reason it hasn't gone down more is because people are thinking this is the bottom.  If everyone stops buying for a few days, I could definitely see this continue to decrease.

So were tulip bulbs!

I was actually wondering about this.  Is this also true with third party sellers and if the price plummets?  For example, if the price just keeps dropping, will people need to find a seller first, or is the sale guaranteed?

You only question that because the price went down.  If the price went up, you would be mad at coinbase.  If you question because it went down, maybe you weren't really prepared to lose it anyways.
