Nodes can choose whichever transactions they want when they create the blocks.  Some prioritize their own miners ahead of others, and include their own miners blocks no matter how low the fee.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:43:04
no.  miners take blocks created by nodes and validate them by hashing.  
a miner does not have a copy of the mempool, nor does it have a copy of the blockchain to limk to the previous block.  it only has a copy of the current block that was assembled by the node.  
regardless of whatever semantics you want to call it, the node sends the work to the miners.  the node chooses which work to send.

Your accountant is wrong.  There is a lot of argument over whether the "like kind" exchange ever applied to crypto, but even if it did, it definitely doesn't in 2018.
Each trade, including trading for other crypto is a taxable event.
Yes, in reality, it all washes out in the end to a certain degree, but the thing that matters to the government is when they get paid.  If you received $1000 in BTC in 2017, and in 2018 it was worth $10,000 and you traded it for an equal amount of ETH, then the government gets it's tax in 2018, even if you didn't sell that ETH in 2018.
Further, with the changes in tax tables every year, and the fact that your taxable income may put you in different tax brackets, that can affect things.
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:02:12
yes, i’m sure.
nodes assemble blocks, miners perform proof of work on those blocks.  of course only nodes that have miners will create blocks with pow performed.
read this chapter on assembling blocks
@_date: 2018-01-01 02:09:04
I think you are confusing mining nodes with miners.  mining nodes are nodes that have miners connected.  miners just perform the proof of work on the blocks provided by the mining nodes.
regular nodes without miners do not assemble blocks.  this is why miners only submit nonces, and not the full block.  the node assembles the nonce into the final block.
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:19:33
miners get work from nodes.  the nodes assemble the blocks.  most miners are not full nodes, since they get work from other nodes.

@_date: 2017-12-27 07:19:42
not really.  because it’s not an entirely trustless system.  For instance, we have to trust that a majority of nodes are honest and not colluding.
The trustless part refers to transactions between participants.  The person I send to does not have to trust me, if het trusts the blockchain.

a bubble is nothing like a pyramid either. 
you do not understand what a pyramid is.  a pyramid is like those old email forwarding scams where you send $1 to the people on the list, then you add your name and forward it to 10 people.
it relies on new money to keep it going.  bitcoin, like any commodity is a store of value that is traded.  you buy and you can sell it whenever you like at a value that is equal mor, or less than you paid. 
they are not even remotely similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:06:03
no.  either you don’t understand what a pyramid scheme is, or you don't understand how a commodity works.
in a pyramid scheme, you pay someone who guarantees you a return on your investment.  they then use that money to pay out those returns to previous investors.  it requires that there be more and more investors to keep paying the upper levels.
eventually, you run out of possible investors, and there is nobody left, so it collapses.
Bitcoin is investing in a commodity, where you own the thing purchased, and can resell it whenever you want.
a pyramid is like social security.  bitcoin is like gold.
they are not the same thing. at all.

really?  so that's why each and every transaction is processed on a first come, first served basis, and not at the whim of the node creating the block?  oh wait...
imagine that a majority of nodes were under the control of a single country, and that country decided it didn’t want anyone from another country to have bitcoin.  say, a country like Tibet, or Taiwan. 
it could choose not to process transactions from those countries and not accept blocks from other nodes that include transactions from those countries.  and largely be successful, overwriting other nodes chains that might include them... and since the longest chain wins...

you can double spend a transaction until it has at least 1 confirmation.  for instance, I send you .1 btc with a lower fee, it may sit in the unconfirmed state for a while, but the recipient sees that the transaction is pending.
up until the point it is confirmed at least once, I can abandon the transaction and send the coins to a different address with a higher fee and beat the original transaction to confirmation.
the original transaction is then ignored since the coins have already been spent.

no, it is not similar.  and no.  gold has only limited intrinsic value, and that value is eclipsed by it’s value as a store of value.  few people want to use gold as an electrical conductor, for instance when its price is very high.
nobody wants a gold coin for its face value when its gold value is 10x its face value.
gold is exactly equivalent to bitcoin.  it is nothing like a pyramid. at all.  period.

Yes, anyone can change the protocol whenever they want.  But, in most cases, the vast majority of hash will not follow that fork.  There have already been dozens of bitcoin forks that you don't even know about... but they just quietly died.
The nodes decide.  it's called a consensus for a reason.  If the majority chooses to change, then change happens.

When someone says that something of monetary value has an intrinsic value, it means that it has a value for something other than as a monetary instrument.  (ie, what value does it have other than a market value).
Gold, is used for many purposes that are not monetary, from decorative (jewelry, and various other kinds of decorations) to industrial (used in electronics, and others).
Corporations (for which stock is the monetary ownership of said company) have the value of it's assets, and potentially the value other things it does.

The address is not a random number.  Well, it is, but the address is not.  The address is your public key, and is used to validate your transactions.  Only your private key, which is a mathematical match to your public key can sign the transactions.  You can't generate a mathematical unique name per se.
Ok, that's not quite true.  You can seed your wallet address using a very long unique name (a string of words, which can be a phrase or just random words).  So, you can use that seed to re-generate your account should you need it.

Those bitcoins don't disappear.  They are still on the blockchain.  It's not like burning fiat.  In fact, you can't tell the difference between lost crypto and someone just holding on to it (as is the recommended guidance by many).  Much like you can't tell when people are just stuffing money in a mattress.
In fact, while Bitcoin will eventually become deflationary, it currently is not.  12.5 Bitcoins are added to the supply every 10 minutes, which is about 657,000 BTC every year.  That means Bitcoin inflates almost 4% per year, which is actually more than the USD.  Although, the rate of inflation will slow over time because the amount of new BTC introduced into circulation is constant, while the total number of coins increases.
One key difference between fiat and bitcoin though, is that with the exception of a few fledgling borrowing services, and borrowing services on exchanges for leveraged trading, bitcoin that is being held isn't be put to use like most banks do.  This leads to a potential Bitcoin recession if enough people do that.

It depends on what you mean by fraudulent.  
If you mean, how can I be sure a transaction isn't forged, or a duplicate spend.. then yes, bitcoin protects from that.  If you mean "How can I be sure that the funds came from a legitimate source that was not fraudulent" then there is no way to know that for sure.  And, even if the source is fraudulent, there is no way to reverse the transaction.. so.. oh well.

The fee is not based on the amount, but the transaction size.  Have you had a lot of small transactions?  If so, then the fee will be larger to consolidate them all.
It sounds like you've got a lot of change in your wallet, that could be part of the problem.  But, Coinbase should tell you what the fee is.  Average fee these days is about $4-7 though.  It's very possible It could be $14 if your wallet is filled with dust.

The blocksize, and blocktime are fixed to create a stable transaction per second rate.  The difficulty is adjusted to ensure this (when blocks are solved too fast, difficulty goes up to lower transactions per second).

The "puzzle" statement is just a simplification for people to understand.  
Imagine you were a locksmith, and you wanted to create a key that would open a lock (let's ignore the many shortcuts that can do this for the time being).
You would first insert a blank key, and see if that opened the lock, then you would file off bits and pieces, each time trying the lock again, creating different pin combinations.
That's basically the way the puzzle works.  Each attempt is a slightly different set of data, but the "puzzle" is the same.  The puzzle is the hashing algorithm used, which in the case of Bitcoin is SHA-256.

A Pyramid scheme is when early adopters are paid by later adopters.  New adopters are placed "under" the older adopters and form a pyramid because it takes more newer adopters to pay everyone above them.
If I go to you and say "I'll give you $20 next week if you give me $10 now", and then go to another person and do the same.. and in a week I have a bunch of money and I start paying the people who first paid me with that money, that's a pyramid scheme.
Eventually, you run out of people who are either unwilling or unable to keep putting money into it, and at that point you are unable to pay the later adopters anymore.  So, you take what's left and head to a country without extradition.
Bitcoin is NOT that.  Nobody is paying other people with the investments of the people that came before it.  
Bitcoin is no different from any other currency exchange, and it's not that different from the stock market, with the exception that stocks are typically issued against assets, so if the stock tanks, then assets can be sold to pay back investors.  That doesn't really exist in currency exchange (virtual or otherwise).

First, you have to understand that in most cases, you're not working a block alone.  So, there is some task master that doles out work to people.  
Second, that would vary by algorithm.  However, in the case of Bitcoin, for instance, I believe the work you are assigned is typically assigned based on a formula that is based on your wallet address, so that everyones "seed" work is going to be different.

What does that have to do with anything?  This is not like a stock split.  You don't get 2 of the same thing.  It's more like getting 1 Euro for 1 Dollar.  
It is, however, inflationary in a sense because most people will sell their forked coin for BTC, so in effect it gives a small amount of free coin to everyone interested in having it.  Like someone exchanging their Euro for more dollars.  It doesn't actually increase the number of coins in circulation, but it does give people more of what is in circulation.
In a stock split situation, the number of shares are doubled (or whatever ratio the split is).  That is not happening.  It would be like if one company buys another company, and all the shareholders in company 1 get shares of company 2 as well.  But even that is not a good analogy, since buying the company being bought often gets shares of the buyer.

Well, first of all, SP20's are not in production anymore.  All that's available is all that's available.  There certainly are not 1.76 million of these machines in existence.  I doubt there are 10,000 of them in existence. 
Second, there are other costs here... Even if there were that many, and you could get them all for $100 (as soon as anyone got wind that you were trying to buy out the entire line of them, they'd jack up the prices).  There's still electrical costs, which are 4x the S5 (.9W/GH) which is not insignificant.

The tax system isn't designed to handle magical money that appears out of nowhere, that you may or may not know about, and you may or may not use even if you know about it.
In the real world, when an asset splits, one of them loses value to give to the other.  That didn't really happen here (although some people will try to persuade you that if the split didn't happen, BTC would be valued at $3400, which isn't a given.. since so much of the price is psychological).
The IRS's guidance says that mined coin is property, and is treated like someone just gave it to you.  So, you have to estimate it's fair value at the time you acquired it (or it's cost basis).  You also owe capital gains when you sell it if it has appreciated in value from when you acquired it.
I'm not a tax specialist, so I can't tell you much more, and certainly don't take this as tax advice.
I'm also under the impression that we cannot count the cost of electricity, or the mining equipment as tax deductible unless you're incorporated.  So really, it's a triple whammy.

No, you're ignoring the present tense, with the future tense.
Nobody is "buying" a lot of coin, they have placed buy orders below the current market rate.  Those aren't actual buys, they're maybe buys.  They're offers to buy.  Often times, those disappear before the market actually drops.  It's called spoofing.
@_date: 2017-08-28 07:58:33
Too many factors to say.  It depends on the current price being paid on NH by buyers.  It depends on the current price at the exchange when you sell.  It depends on the amount of (or lack of) luck you get when mining.  It depends on how long your order lasts vs PPLNS share pruning... 
All you can do is look for a spread that is large enough to make you comfortable with doing it.
You have to do your research, do the math, and build in enough buffer.. You will lose money on some orders, and make money on others.  Ideally you make more than you lose.  
It's not like you can just open up a stock trading account, and throw money on a random stock and expect to make money.  You have to research the stocks, what their history is, what the trends are.. you might even look into the long term viability of the company, and any upcoming changes that might affect stock price.

There is no guarantee that a segwit transaction will have lower fees.  At least not yet.
You can only use segwit in wallets that support Segwit, which right now is only a couple of wallets.  If you use bitcoin core, then you need only open the debug console and type "addwitnessaddress &lt;one of your wallet addresses&gt;" then you use that wallet address for transactions.  Nearly everyone you will be sending transactions to will be standard wallets addresses though.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:36:08
That doesn't make sense.  The CAD bitcoin price is ~5400.  If they use a 7000 rate, then that would mean you would get less bitcoin for your $60.  
60/7000 = .00857140BTC
60/5400 = .01111111BTC
Maybe they use a higher exchange rate rather than charging an ATM fee..  if that's the case, the rate is pretty steep.  I'm not sure i'd call it a scam, since they tell you specifically what the exchange rate their using is.  It's your choice to use it or not.

Yes.  Each exchange is its own little universe, and prices fluctuate based on what people are buying and selling for.  There's no central bitcoin exchange that keeps the prices synchronized, unlike say the NYSE.

Transaction fees are based on the number of bytes in your transaction, not the amount of the transaction.  You pay the same fee if it's $6 or $600 or $600m dollars.
Transaction size is based on the number of inputs and outputs.  If you receive a lot of small transactions (say from faucets) then when you go to send them somewhere else it will cost a lot because each small transaction is an input which increases your transaction size.

It's not a technical argument.  Sure, we *can* add anything we want, just program it up.  The issue is a socio-economic one.  Some people want change, others are steadfast against it.  Bitcoin is too big, with too diverse of a group for any hardfork to pass without serious contention, and even then it only happens when there is no other choice.
A feature that is a "nice to have" is not going to pass consensus.  The risk to the ecosystem is too great for random changes.

No, no, no, no.  All of your understanding is wrong.
There's no such thing as a "Bitcoin" as in an object.  It's just a unit of measurement for currency.  Also, you don't encrypt or decrypt anything.   I know it's called a "crypto" coin, but that's not because it encrypts anything.  It's because it uses cryptographic hashing.  Hashing is not encrypting.
Your bitcoin balance is simply a series of transactions in an internet based ledger.  That's it.  Your wallet is just the keys used to sign those transactions..  That's it.

First thing to understand is that Bitcoin is not a bank account.  You aren't "depositing funds" into it, and therefore there is no "retrieving funds".
You are doing the same thing as buying them a trading card in the hope that 17 years from now that trading card is worth a lot more.  There is no guarantee it will be worth anything.
However, Bitcoin is already almost 9 years old.  It's likely it will still exist in some form in another 17, but a lot can happen in that time.  For instance, governments might make it impossible to publicly trade bitcoin for fiat.  Bitcoin value might also tank and be worth less than you paid for it.
All you can do is hope.

That argument is illogical.  Each coin has it's own ecosystem, and it's own buying power.  Just like each economy.  It doesn't matter what backs the value of a coin or currency, the value is still what's important.
Your argument can be turned on it's side.  Stocks essentially all serve the same market as well, yet the fact that one stock may fall or rise doesn't necessarily affect other stocks.  
The fact that coins are virtual means they have some properties that stocks do not.  Stocks are (usually) based on the value of the company they correlate to, which includes assets and liabilities as well as perceived future profitability.  A company can't just be duplicated.
But, since virtual currencies are entirely speculative, with no real physical or intrinsic value, their value is essentially arbitrary.  Cloning a currency doesn't necessarily means the original currency loses any value, as we've seen with BTC which has lost almost nothing (ie, about the same as typical fluctuations before the split).
Let's use a corporate example.  Let's say there are two brothers who start a corn flake company.  They get into a fight, and one takes the recipe and starts a different company.  It could be argued that the introduction of another competitor lessens the potential profit margin for the original, but that would happen regardless of whether it was the brother, or someone totally new who happens to come up with a similar recipe.  
Essentially, the fork is a competitor, with it's own backing from it's own sources... some of those sources might have invested in the original if the competitor didn't exist, but maybe they wouldn't have... Some might sell their positions in one and buy the other.  Some will ignore one fork or the other.. It's not a clear cut situation.
Essentially, BCH forked to whatever people were willing to pay for it.  Unlike the Ethereum fork, where the mainline forked away from the original, in this case the original was unchanged and fork is now the lesser of the coins.

There is no law that prevents one from paying cash for something that is not illegal to purchase.  That's ridiculous to claim that its illegal.  That would make Ebay, Craigslist, thousands of newspapers, and 100's of other classified sites illegal.  They're not.  Particularly if it's between private citizens.
If you're a corporation, that may be somewhat different, as there are laws about transacting in cash for large purposes, such as cars, boats, etc.. it's still not illegal, but paperwork has to be filed if such transactions occur.
Of course none of that matters, because FinCEN, DOJ, HS, FBI, IRS, etc.. can often seize assets whenever they want, if they suspect you of doing something illegal.  But in order to go to jail, you still have to commit a crime (usually).

It's not the relative merits of the proposal, it's the risk to the ecosystem for implementing something that is not critical to the survival of the coin.

My point about the market cap is that bitcoin isn't large enough to be a factor in anything google would produce.  They're not going to use it in android pay because it's not capable of sustaining that kind of transaction rate, and coin valuation would be crazy.  
Are they using blockchain, almost assuredly, are they using bitcoin?  Why would they?

If you want to coalesce your wallet, the only thing you can do is wait for fees to lower to the point that 0 or 1 satoshi per byte fee is viable.  You could have done this just a few weeks ago when the mempool was empty, but you missed that opportunity.
Segwith may result in an empty mempool, or it may not.. we won't know until segwit activates.
However, that's only part of it.  Your wallet has to allow you to send a low-fee transaction.  Many wallets do not.

First, no crypto coin exchange is regulated.
Second, They might fill an order, but not post it right away.  It might take some time for their system catch up.
As for why at .078, because the price may have been .078 when it was filled.
An additional thought, just because the price reaches .078 doesn't mean there is enough buy orders to fill everyones order.  It may take more orders at that price.

The use of the term "fork" is misleading.  There's a difference between a fork and a split.  A softfork (generally) doesn't result in a chain split because rules are compatible.  A hardfork does result in a split (but only if there is contention and some want to use one chain and some want to use another.  If everyone follows the fork then no chain split occurs).

You paid a withdrawal fee, not a transaction fee.  Exchanges typically charge a flat rate for withdrawals, of which they pay the actual transaction fee out of that.  They keep anything above the actual transaction fee.
This is like when an ebay seller charges a flat shipping fee..  if their actual cost is less, they pocket the difference.

Your post is confusing.  Did you, in fact, specifically purchase $60 in bitcoin, or did you calculate that the amount of bitcoin you purchased should be worth $60?  The intent is import here, and what exactly was offered versus what you assumed.
Tell us exactly what the ATM said you were buying (not your interpretation of it, what the actual screen said verbatim), What it said the fees would be, etc..  Understand that bitcoin fees are very high right now.   Plus the ATM vendor has to make a profit somehow.
Also, that's not a valid bitcoin transaction id.
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:09:41
When we say "the fee is low" we mean that the fee that is required for the transaction to be confirmed is low.  Each individual service you use, wallet, etc.. can set their own fees and Bitcoin has no control over that.
The fee is low, just because whatever you're using is setting high fees is not the fault of Bitcoin.

All the people saying it's not safe are talking about a strict mathematical sense.
In practice, such a technique is probably good enough for "drive by" attacks.  If someone hacks into your system and finds your key, unless they know for a fact that you have a lot of money in your wallet, and are specifically targeting you, they won't bother to try and figure out what you might have done to the key.  
So long as you don't document that change, it's about the same amount of effort to randomly guess a key as to try different variations of your key.
This *IS* security through obfuscation, but as long as it's in your head, it's effectively secure.  The level of security goes down if you use the exact same technique on multiple keys, but again, this is really only the case if someone is actively targeting you.

No.  
It's simple.  If you need a new client, and new pools to run your coin.. you're an alt coin, regardless of how much hashing power you have.  
BCH made the change here, not BTC.  So regardless of what BCH did, BTC would always be BTC.
This was not the case when Ethereum split, since Ethereum was forking away from the old code.  ETC became the alt coin because the mainline decided to change, and the hash power followed the mainline.
@_date: 2017-08-25 01:23:22
You're not making any sense.  Where does $7000 come into it? where does 5000 come into?  
There are two fees you will pay at an ATM, the network fee and the ATM fee.  The ATM operator doesn't get any of the network fee, so in order to make their profit they need to charge more than just the bitcoin network fee.
A typical bitcoin transaction is 300-500bytes and right now the current fees are above 400 satoshis per byte.  So, let's be conservative and say your transaction is 300 bytes, and paying 400 satoshis per byte, that's .0012BTC in network fee or about $5USD (this is about the very least you could possibly pay).
So you're probably paying $7-10 in network fee alone, plus whatever the ATM is charging.  
@_date: 2017-08-27 03:05:58
your transaction had 6 inputs.  and &gt; 900 byte transaction.  so you are paying 3x the fee just because of that

It's only a fork if a significant number of people do not follow the change.  A change may be considered a "hard fork" but that doesn't mean the chain is actually split.  Splitting requires mining on both chains.
I'm not saying it won't split, nor am I saying it will.  I really don't know.  It will depend on the circumstances.  So it's a little pointless to speculate.

When you move all your funds to another wallet, it condenses them all to one output.  So the next transaction after you move your funds will be smaller.  But, unless you're always moving all your funds, you will end up with change.. much like if you go through the drive through all the time and put your change in your cupholder.. eventually it's a pain to deal with.

that statistic is skewed because a large percentage of people keep their coins on an exchange (despite being told they shouldn't), particularly those that are engaged in active trading.
When you move money to an exchange, the money is centralized and taken out of your specific wallet and tracked internally via internal database.  So you might have 1 million people with &gt; 1BTC stored in 100 or 200 wallets.

First, Bitcoin is not totally Deflationary.  There is a small amount of new currency added to the economy every 10 minutes (12.5 coins currently).  
Second, it will be 100 years before all the coins are exhausted.  What currency has lasted that long without an adjustment of some sort?  
Third, people still trade gold and silver.. and while yes, these are still being mined, it's basically the same principle.  Eventually mining will run out.
Finally, the real value that banks and currency give is that money is put to use, and not just hoarded.  Money is lent to others to spend, used for various purposes, and then given back upon request.  This will also likely happen at some point, since coin on the blockchain sitting there doing nothing has no real use.
@_date: 2017-08-02 06:33:53
There is "calculation".  There is a 1:1 BTC/BCH for unspent coin deposited prior to the fork.  If you have 1BTC, you have 1BCH.
As far as the value.. well, exchanges figure that out.  They open up trading, and the price is whatever people are willing to pay.  Valuation is entire market based.
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:16:45
Bitmain's quality is notoriously poor.  So, yeah.  Lots of people have issues with their equipment.
Difficulty increases as the amount of hashing power increases, it's designed to keep block times stable.  What that means is that difficulty rises means you earn less coins for the same hash rate.

Correlation != Causation
Just because the price of Bitcoin went up after the split does not mean the split caused it.  
It's possible that all the drama caused increased publicity, which attracted more people to it, but that would mean that the price would go up regardless of the fork then..  Just the increased publicity would have caused it.

I was trying not to confuse further.  IMO SegWit is essentially locked because virtually all blocks are being mined with segwit signaling.

Well, when i'm in the mood to buy, I check out WhatToMine.com and look for the highest priced coins.  Then I check the prices being paid on NiceHash, compare them and if there is a large enough opportunity, I pull the trigger.
I tend to do small orders, but in reality long running orders will reduce your variance.  However, I tend to set my order prices at the very bottom and keep on top of it to make sure it's getting hash by adjusting the price.  If you're going to do a long running order you would have to buy higher than the the bare minimum in order to assure you keep miners while you're not watching it.
As an example, earlier today I noticed that ZCL had spiked.  The problem with ZEC and ZCL is that they take a very long time to confirm and you run the risk the price going back down before you can sell your rewards.  But, I went ahead and bought .01.  After all was said and done, I made .018.  Not a huge amount of money, but I look at it this way.. If I transferred that .01 from NiceHash to CoinBase to sell, i'd pay a several percentage point fee, by buying hash, i'm essentially getting my coins out of NiceHash without any fee, and making some money on top of it.. so as long as i'm beating the fee that's all I care about.

At that age, they want low risk investments.

There are two prices on any exchange.  The bid, and the ask.  You only ever see one of them listed as "the price"  Sometimes it's an average of these.   The difference between the bid and ask is called the spread.
Gdax has a $0.01c spread, plus a "taker fee" on market orders of .25% (unless you're a whale, then you get discounts based on your trading volume). There is a 0% fee for limit orders.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:29:51
Fees are largely voluntary.  You can set whatever fee you want.  Don't want to pay $12?  Pay $.50.  Yes, it will take longer to confirm, but you can do it.
Assuming you haven't chosen a crappy wallet that doesn't let you set fees.. but then that's on you.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:50:28
that is so not true.  the price determines how much bitcoin you can buy for your money.  
if you have $10k, and buy at 5000, you get 2 bitcoin.  at 50k, that's $100k.
if you buy at $7.5k, then you get 1.5 bitcoin, only worth $75k.  the price you buy at amplifies the end results

@_date: 2017-11-20 05:07:54
actually, yes.  the price makes a difference.  a big difference. 
if I have $5000 to buy bitcoin, and lets say I buy at 5000.  I have 1 bitcoin.  when bitcoin is worth 500,000, I have 500,000.
if I buy at 2500, then I have 2 bitcoin, which is then worth 1,000,000.  so yeah, price you buy matters.

Bitcoin forks are indeed strange, but a fork doesn't increase the supply of bitcoin any more than simply creating a new coin or ICO creates more bitcoin supply.  
It's a new coin, that just happens to share the same blockchain up to the point of the fork, so you inherit all the transactions that happened previous to the fork (but not after).
It's very weird, and hard to grasp why it works.  The actual creation of the new coin is not a hard thing to understand.  That's just mechanics.
The question you should be asking is not "Does this increase the supply of bitcoin?" (which it doesn't)... the question is "Why does the market value these forked coins that are created out of nothing?"
And that question is much harder to answer.

The thing is, AFAIK although there have been several forks per se, none of them created a chain split because they never mined &gt; 1MB blocks (which would have created the split, and resulted with coins on both chains).
Bitcoin Cash took a slightly different approach in that it forced a chain split immediately, even though blocks were not yet &gt; 1MB.  Thus a chain split resulted.

Ok, so I went and took a look.  All this was is a variation of a fork airdrop.  This could not apply to a vote for a large number of reasons.  First, What's to stop me from, say, buying $10m worth of bitcoin right before the snapshot, and then selling it right after?  Nothing.  Essentially, anyone with a large amount of liquid cash they can move around would be able to completely overpower everyone else.
Second, if the vote occurs over a month, you're now penalizing people that get their coin after the snapshot date, but within the voting window.  
Third, it still doesn't address the issue of requiring users to create votes for every wallet they have, which could be a huge burden. 
And fourth, it precludes everyone who is on an exchange from voting.
And Finally, it doesn't provide any mechanism to prevent forced voting.. where people are held at gunpoint or forced by other means to vote in the manner proscribed.

Yes, but those altcoins aren't vulnerable to replay attack.  If it is vulnerable to replay attack, it will have no value.  Nobody will trust it.  
To put this another way.  If two coins are vulnerable to replay attacks, you're only going to want to keep your coin in one of them.  It really doesn't matter which, so long as you don't have coin in both.  Thus, everyone will migrate to the one that offers the most advantage, which will be the one called Bitcoin that has the most hash.

If your numbers are actually correct, and you're not ignoring some important points, then yes.  I can't be bothered to verify this, but typically markets auto correct to this sort of thing if there is a real major difference in prices.  
In reality, you're probably seeing differences in both the BTC/USD, BTC/BRL and USD/BRL pairs that are coincidentally working out in your favor at the moment.  It may not be like that in an hour, or a day.  
However, it makes perfect sense, regardless of whether you make money or not, to have your family buy bitcoin in the US, transfer that to you to cash out in local currency.  They don't have to take any money with them.  
Also, they don't have to wait to send it to your wallet for when they get there.  They can do it as soon as they have the coins.  Remember, it may take a few days for you to exchange the bitcoin for fiat that they can spend (unless you have a bitcoin debit card for your country).
Also, I would stop "rounding", as those decimal places add up quickly and can deteriorate your profit.  Also, take into account any exchange fees, bank fees, etc..

Like most kinds of things of this nature, sometimes you make money, sometimes you lose.  You endeavor to make more than you lose (same with trading, not all trades are profitable).
NiceHash is based on orders.  You put in an order, for a certain price, and a certain limit of hashing power.  It runs until your order runs out or you cancel it (canceling gives you a refund of unused funds).
So the very concept of "breaking even yet" is incorrect.  Either an order is profitable, or it's not.

It's hard to say, since fees are based on the number of bytes your transaction takes up in the block.  If it's a single input/output then that should be about 300 bytes.  So, that's about 166 Satoshi's per byte which should be sufficient.  If it's a larger transaction (with lots of bytes) it might not be. 
Fees are not based on the amount of bitcoin, so you pay the same for .1BTC or 10000BTC.
Post a transaction id, so we can verify.
It should confirm.  Worst case scenario, it will come back to you after 2 weeks, but with that level of fee you should see it confirm within a day.
@_date: 2017-09-06 03:03:41
By controlling supply, increased demand means higher prices.  Bitcoin is easily divisible, and more digits can be added to the right of the decimal place to further divide it when it's value becomes too great.  100 years from now, we might make .00000000000000001 BTC per year ;)

Any time someone provides a service there is usually a fee.  Ever looked into buying Euros (or any other currency?)  There's a fee associated.  
The exchange that sells you the coins takes some risk in the process.  If you buy by credit card, there is a large fee usually because credit card transactions can be reversed (called a charge back).  Since Bitcoin can't be reversed, if you bought and reversed the transaction, the exchange would be out the value of the bitcoin, because they couldn't get it back.  Thus, fraud is factored into the fees.
Many bank transfers can also be reversed, and they require more work to process.  
You're not going to find anyone that trades that doesn't charge a fee.

I have the exact same problem.  I sent coin from Cryptopia to CB a few hours ago.  The transaction is complete, I have a transaction id, it's already been received by CB with 50+ confirmations.. but doesn't show up in my history, and no credit to my account.. not even a "pending".  
FWIW, all coin sent to coinbase wallets gets sent from your wallet to their central wallets for pooling upon arrival, so don't be worried about that.  But, the fact that CB has received the funds, and already moved them, without so much as a pending status, no email of receiving funds, no balance updates is pretty disconcerting.
I've submitted a ticket, but have no hope it will ever be addressed, given the black hole that CB support is.  I can only hope they notice the discrepencies and fix it themselves.

No.  You're lucky you can exchange paypal at all.  Most places only allow you to receive payments of bitcoin sales.
The reason is that Paypal, like most credit cards, can have the transactions reversed up to several months after the sale.  The high fees are to adjust for this kind of fraud.  Since Bitcoin can't be reversed, the exchange would be left holding the bag in this case.
You aren't going to find anyone other than a local noob that will exchange bitcoin for paypal at a low fee.

Let's put this another way.  Let's say I have one US Dollar, and one Zimbabwean Dollar.  Let's say that if I spend either of them, the recipient can take the other as well.
If I buy some bread with my USD, do I give a rats ass if my Zimbabwean dollar is also taken?  Not at all, it's worth nothing.  Therefore, I couldn't care less.
The other way around?  Umm.. ok, but you'd have to have trillions of Zimbabwean dollars to buy much of anything, and nobody is going to have that many USD.. so you'd be stuck with maybe a few thousand ZWD to match your few thousand USD, and a few thousand ZWD is also worth nothing, so you would not be able to sell it for anything of value.   So you would NEVER buy anything with ZWD an no way for the replay attack to take your USD.
This is the essence of the argument.  Only one chain survives.
Now, if you're stupid, and decide to give all your ZWD to a friend, and he also takes all your USD.. that's on you.  You didn't split them up before giving your ZWD away.  The solution is to forget the ZWD even exists and never touch it.  
That's your replay protection.  And you can implement it all by yourself, without any support from any devs.

Yes, I know how they work.  What I should have said was "That's not how a majority hard fork works".
Let me illustrate.  Hardfork happens, majority (&gt; 90%) supports the new chain.  Making the original chain, effectively worthless.  No exchanges support it, nobody accepts it... There's no hash.. so transactions don't happen for weeks, months, maybe even years...
So, yes... sending my btc to someone can be replayed and you would lose your worthless alternate chain coin.  Big deal.  And, since your alternate coin is worthless, there is no reason you would transfer it anywhere.  So your bitcoin would be safe.  
The only reason you would care is if it wasn't a majority fork, and that's unlikely to happen.

It's a well known strategy called arbitrage.  And, it's the reason the prices tend to stay close to, or the same on many exchanges.
It's not feasible to buy/sell on one, transfer the coin/money to the other, and sell/buy as the time it will take (not to mention fees you'll pay) will usually cancel out any potential gains.  So in order to make this work, you have to have coin/money on both exchanges, buy/sell one and sell/buy the other at the same (or close enough) time.

We can have 0 fee transactions, in fact, the mempool is empty right now and 0 fee transactions are clearing (slowly, but they'll clear if fees stay like this for a bit). 
The problem is that there are (usually) too many transactions to completely fit in one block.  Thus, some mechanism must be used to select which transactions to include.
Now, they could simply do it by date/time, first come, first serve, but that is easily gameable.  Fees are the only fair way to do it.  
The more transaction backlog, the higher the fees get.

It's impossible to make any changes without forking.  Forking is the process when some users continue to run the old nodes while other miners run the new nodes, and they create mutually incompatible blocks.
The majority of nodes that agree on the rules, produce the longest chain in most cases (the exceptions might be if the rules included a difficulty change or a block time change).
Imagine a church school, where everyone wears the same uniform.  One day, the church decides to change the uniform to a different color.  However, some of the students like the old color and decide to rebel and stay with the same color.
So the next day, some of the students show up in the new color, some in the old.  That's a fork.

Actually, I just did a quick calculation, and it doesn't look like it's such a big gap at all.  Current USD/BRL is $1/3.13 and 1BTC = $3961/12354.08BRL  12354.08/3961 = 3.12, so looks like the exchange is almost exactly the same.
Also, 12354.08BRL = $3952.99USD, not $5000
Hmmm.. Well, the only place I found that shows a BRL quote besides google (where I got the previous quote) is Mercado Bitcoin, which claims a rate on their front page of 14500BRL, so if that is in fact the case.. then yeah.
14500/3952.99 = 3.67BRL, which translates to about a .54BRL/$1 profit (not counting fees)

The problem with hard forks is that they tend to be pushed by a corporate agenda of some sort.

Bitcoin is not one thing.  It's many things to many people.  Your investment vehicle is someone elses currency.  It's not like you can spend a stock certificate, but you can spend a bitcoin (granted, not in a lot of places, but you can).
Further, I've lived in several third world countries that more or less value their currency against the dollar, and when the dollar tanks, so too does their currency.  Gas might go up or down in local currency significantly depending on the dollar rate.
Also, many vendors speculate the prices of their goods.  I might pay $2 one day for gas, and pay $2.25 the next day, despite the vendor having not received any new gas or paid any higher price for that gas.  You can argue that it's in anticipation of having to pay more for the next tanker but that may not be the case either as gas prices may go down.
Bitcoin will not, in it's current form, ever be a currency that the majority of people use.  It has too many issues with scaling, volatility, and transaction time for that to work, but it's not fixed in stone.  It will evolve over time, and these issues will eventually be addressed, and THEN it might be a viable majority currency.
Until then, nobody seriously believes it will be replacing fiat anytime soon.

You would be safer though to send the gold to a different gold wallet as well, since technically someone could replay the gold to your new btc wallet address then when you sent anything from the new one replay that again.  If you send each to different wallets before making any outside transactions to other parties, that's not possible.

"hackable" can mean a lot of things.  In general, Bitcoin relies on well tested, heavily peer reviewed sha-256 cryptographic hash.  
Previous vershions of the sha algorithm, such as sha-0 and sha-1 are no longer "unbroken", although they are still plenty secure for most purposes.  Sha-256 will probably be broken at somepoint as well, but there are stronger versions that bitcoin can move to if need be.

No, it's the responsibility of the minority fork to implement it.  As BCH did.  If the majority of the hash had followed BCH then there would have been no reason to implement it (one of the reasons they didn't until the last minute, because they were under the delusion they would be the majority in the fork).
If you're forking, and you are going to be the majority, there is no reason to care.  The whole point is to snuff out the legacy chain so that it's financially incapable of being solvent.  Thus, no exchanges will support it, and thus no miners will either.

So what you're really asking is "Where can criminals do their business without getting caught?".  Because that's what an exchange that didn't have any verifications would be, a haven for criminals who steal credit cards, and try to buy non-charbackable bitcoin.  
Exchanges have these rules in place for 2 reasons.  1) various countries have anti-money laundering laws and 2) because if they don't, they get tons of chargebacks (credit cards and paypal can be charged back 6+ months after the purchase).  
They build fraud into their fees, but if they reduce fraud their fees can be lower.  Any exchange that wanted to flout anti-money laundering laws would need to charge 50+% in fees to cover all the fraud they'd have to deal with.

How exactly would you propose that I vote with my bitcoin?  I'm not spending it to vote.  Any other way is ridiculous.  
I'll be honest.  90+% of bitcoin owners (not 90+% of the bitcoin wealth's owners) don't even understand what 2x is, or it's ramifications if they do, or have their own independent thoughts on it (rather than just regurgitating what someone with an agenda scared them into believing).
Both sides of this argument issue massive amounts of propaganda, and anyone pushing that propaganda has an agenda.  So be very suspect of it.  Use your own brain instead.
I mean, look at all the massive propaganda that went into the campaign against segwit.. how everyone was going to lose their money, cause anyone could spend it.. how it would be instantly hacked because of "obvious" security flaws, and more... None of that happened.  On the other side, many people argued that fees would instantly go down.. which also didn't happen, as it will require adoption by users.  
Regardless, it's still 2 fucking months before anything happens.  Nobody knew if segwit would activate until it did.

Bitcoin is built on a blockchain.  That is, a chain of blocks that are added sequentially.  Each block modifies the block before it, creating a historical chain of events.
If you deposit $1 on block 1, and add $1 on block 2.  You don't have $1.  You have $2.  You have to add the events from all the blocks together to get the final amount. 
If you split the chain at block 2, then you get a block 3 of bitcoin and a block 3 of altcoin.  So, since you have two chains, you follow both back to the beginning and you have two chains of $1 transactions, so you have $2 on chain 1 and $2 on chain 2.
If you deposit $1 on chain 1 after the fork, then you have $3 on chain 1, and $2 on chain still.
I used dollars to make sense, but in the real case you're dealing with units of that coin, and those units can, and typically are, valued differently.  So you might have .000002BTC and .000002BTG, with the BTC being worth $6000/1BTC and the BTG being worth $300/1BTG.
So if you had 1BTC on the chain before the fork, after the fork you'd have both 1BTC and 1BTG, and if BTC were worth $6000 and BTG was worth $300 you'd have $6300 total worth of currency.
Yes, it's weird, but that's how the blockchain works...  Whether or not the new chain has any value, though.. that's entirely a market thing and not a technology thing.  The weird thing is that the market gives those new coins value.
You may ask, why do they fork an existing chain and not just start a new one?  The answer is.. Instant market share.  By giving everyone with bitcoin and equal amount of the new coin, they jump start their alt-coin and give everyone skin in the game.  
The idea is that people will continue using it.. but a lot of people just sell it off to buy more bitcoin.

While Vinny was evasive, and not communicating well.. going off on tangents that didn't make a lot of sense, etc.. And his reasoning seems suspect.. I don't think he is the baseline 2x supporter.  His reasons (whatever they are, I couldn't quite tell, other than the gave his word argument) are his reasons, and not every 2x supporters reasons.
I would support a 2x, if and only if it was a near-unanimous consensus.  I agree with Vinny that 2 chains can't survive.  Either 2x fails and dies or it succeeds and the legacy chain dies.  That's the only condition I support 2x.
I'm a user, so I don't care about politics. I don't care who's "in control" (despite that making no sense, since it's an open source project.. you can't "fire" anyone.. you can kick them out of your repo, and not accept their PR's, but they can just release their own version).
All I care is that my bitcoin continues to retain value, and I don't believe having yet another fork will achieve that.
Regarding the "2MB is not needed" argument... I think it's clear that it is.  Sure, fees may be lowish at the moment, but a few weeks ago they were not.  And since it takes months, if not years to get a fork to happen, when it's needed we'll have to wait in agony for a very long time.  It's like highway planning.  If you know for a fact that traffic will double in 2 years, you don't build a road for the traffic patterns of today.
Also, there seemed to be a lot of comments that effectively said ANY hard fork (even one that isn't contentious and has 100% support, should that ever occur) will never be "bitcoin".  So, Bitcoin can never change... that argument seems short sighted.
It also ignores the fact that Ethereum successfully survived a hard fork with "Ethereum" becoming the new chain.  It's happened, just not for Bitcoin.
And finally, is a fork that 100% of the people follow really a fork?  I'm not saying 2x will be that, but general idea that a fork has to be copy is not quite right.  The shared portion of the chain is just that, shared.  They were both the same up until the event that causes the fork.
I vote we not call it a fork, but rather a merge.  Since merging is the only way it can possibly work.

You have to send your transaction, and then use the coin control features of your wallet to include an additional address where you send 0 coins, this additional address is a well known "anyone can spend" account, so you want to make sure you don't actually send any coins to it or they will be gone faster than you can blink.
The address is explicitly blocked by the 2x chain, so if the transaction includes that address, the 2x chain won't process it, thus it can't be replayed.

Miners don't need users to make blocks.  The blocks can be entirely empty and they still get their coins.
Users have to BEG miners to include their transactions via ever increasing bribes (fees).  I don't see how anyone can justify the perspective that miners have to listen to users.  Also, considering that in order to mine, you need a node, that makes Miners both Miners and Nodes.  So they can validate their own blocks if need be, and if they are in collusion with the exchanges.. that's all that's needed.  Users will have to use their rules in order to get the fiat they want.
As far as PoW change, good luck getting any two nodes to agree on what that would be.  The dividedness of nodes works in the miners favor.

Bitcoin Gold isn't as contentious because it's a fork to change the Proof of Work algorithm to Equihash.  This will make it resistant to asic miners and allows GPU miners to mine it.

There is already a contentious fork.  We don't need another one.  The only way 2x makes sense is if it's nearly unanimous.

If you mean the amount of BTC you're sending, no.  But "size" in Bitcoin means a different thing, it means how many bytes of data the transaction takes up.

Not really, a lot of improvements can happen organically, and with more or less universal approval when there aren't agendas to push.  Much like politics.  There are times when agendas can be pushed aside, and everyone agree on something (it doesn't happen often, but it does happen).  It's human nature to get behind something that is favorable to you, and not others.  Real improvements are improvements that everyone can agree are worth it.

New fork = 99% of the hash, exchanges call this "bitcoin", users don't notice any difference
Current chain = nothing, no exchanges support it, no point in trying a replay attack, the coin is worthless.

There is no government issued currency in the world that is based on any physical assets.  This used to be the case, before the 1970's when there was a so-called "gold standard", but that hasn't been the case in decades.
Today, many governments use a fractional banking reserve system that allows banks to print money whenever they need it.
That's the real scam.

Yes, it's perfectly legal to print your own money in the US.  There is no law against it.  There are laws against counterfeiting and fraud though, so if the currency looks too much like US currency, you can be charged with those crimes.
As an example, the Ithica Hours private currency has been around for decades, and the Franklin Mint has been making "commemorative coins" for years as well.

Yeah, seems like a dictionary attack would be possible.  We know it's typically 12 words, taken from the English dictionary for many generators.  There are about 171,000 words in the oxford dictionary, and you can reduce that by quite a bit because the generators seem to use only common words.  So, if you know the dictionary they use, that could get you a much smaller attack space.
Still pretty big, but if you have enough equipment, may be doable.

First, what's happing tomorrow is the User Activated Hard Fork, also known as the Bitcoin Cash fork.  This is not related to segwit (other than UAHF supporters don't like SegWit).  
SegWit was already locked in a few weeks ago, and will start being enforced soon, but not tomorrow.

Uhh.. Bitcoin is just another kind of cartel.  A bunch of people get together and agree on how best change the economy that suits them best.  People who are not part of this cartel are left out of the decision making process.
The only difference is bitcoin lowers the bar.  You still need money, at least enough to buy a computer, pay for electricity, and an internet connection.  But you still need money to invest in the endeavor.

You can't mine Bitcoin with a GPU.  You can mine other coins, but the market is really down right now.  A 980Ti draws 250W of power, which if it's used on top of an already busy household could draw more power than you generate with those solar panels.

Uhh.. "Now"?  The $2 bill has been out for like 30 years.
Second, it was a different time.  And it was not legally possible for a white man to marry a black woman (or even cohabitating).  Owning her may have been the only way they could be together if it was a consensual situation.  We don't really know.  I've never read any credible evidence that Sarah Hemmings was unhappy with her situation.
So "raping" is a tough claim to make, and you're just putting your own bias on it.  
I don't know one way or the other.  I'm not going to say the other version was the case either.  But, come on.  Whatever else he may have done, he's one of the primary founding fathers, who authored a good part of it.

All coins are in wallets, per se.  It's just that CoinBase's wallet keys are owned by them, and not you.
The reason people suggest moving your coins to a personal wallet is because you have more control over the future of your coins if there is a fork.

There are no rules around Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.  The tax laws are the same, regardless of whether you are making money off Bitcoin or stocks or property or whatever.  You don't pay taxes on unrealized gains, you pay taxes on realized capital gains.  
The tax details have nothing specific to Bitcoin.  But, it may be more difficult to track and manage all your transactions, and identifying what's realized and what isn't.  But anyone can do that, and it doesn't require a tax professional.

10 days?  More like 10 months, if even that.  You had best be ready to pay that minimum payment for some time to come, because even if the price turns around, it's going to take some time to get back up to the levels you're wanting to reach.
BTW, unless you're planning to hold it for years, chances are the most you will make is doubling your money.  I wouldn't call that "rich".

You would have to brute force the wallet.  That would take more time, on average, than there are seconds left in the life of the universe.  
Sure, you could randomly just guess a wallet address.  This is the public key.  But you would need the private key that corresponds with it in order to do anything.  And the keys have to be cryptographical matches. 
It's like a safe deposit box that requires 2 keys.  You might be able to have one of them, say you steal the bank managers key.  But you would also need the clients key to actually get to it.  (of course, not counting physical brute force.. lol).

You have a basic lack of knowledge of how transaction fees work.
Transaction fees are paid by the byte.  Others have told you this, but you are confusing the cost you pay to your internet provider with the cost of processing a transaction.  They are two different things.
Think about it like this.  If you go to an ATM that does not belong to your bank, they charge you a fee.  Here, it's often $2-3 per transaction.  Essentially that "fee per byte" is a "per transaction" fee.  
So, if you pull $5 out, at $2 per transaction, you pay $2 (total of $7 is withdrawn from your account).  If you do that 10 times, you get $50 but $70 is withdrawn from your account.  But if you'd just withdrawn $50 it would only withdraw $52 from your account.
Now, unlike your ATM, your bitcoins are not stored as a single wad of money in your account.  They are stored as individual transactions.  And whenever you transfer that money, each of those transactions are added together to form the total fee.
So, it's as if you withdrew each transaction separately and sent them to your other wallet in a single transaction.  
The good news is that this money is now in one transaction in your other wallet, so sending that money anywhere else will only incur a single transaction fee.
These fees are paid to the people who process your transactions.  They're called Miners.  And they're expending energy to validate the block to ensure that bitcoin remains safe, and secure.  So, it's not fair to the miners to not be paid for the work they do, it just sucks for you because your transactions are taking up so much space in the block.
@_date: 2017-07-15 19:13:41
I wonder if it's Coinbase trying to slow people down?  They've had notices up about having a huge backlog of withdrawals, so maybe they're trying to reduce the load by upping the fee they pay.

That makes no sense.  Unless i'm actually transporting my cryptokeys with me over the border, how is cryptocurrency in my "holdings" considered crossing the border?  Do I have to declare ForEx holdings as well?  That's basically the same thing.  Do I have to declar all my current stock portfolios?  I mean, I might sell them while i'm overseas... right?
What if someone has created a wallet with more than $10k in cryptocurrency in my name without my knowledge?  Such as when someone creates a trust fund?  
And how, exactly, do they know what my cryptowallet contains if it's not kept at an exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-16 21:03:35
Well, whether or not it's more "secure" is difficult to say.  However, with bc.i you own your own keys.  With coinbase they own your keys.  
So, if coinbase becomes insolvent overnight, they go away with your keys and you have no way to transfer that money anywhere else.  You are also not in charge of which fork they will support going forward.
With bc.i, if they go out of business, I can just load my keys into a different wallet.  And I have access to my funds.

In Bitcoin Core, You can open the debug console and dump the private key.  Your public key is your wallet address.  This mentions the "satoshi client", but it works the same in Bitcoin Core wallet.

IIRC, a blockchain.info wallet gives you a seed you can use to re-generate wallet address on any wallet that supports seeds.  So no, I don't think BC.i has any say in the matter.

To be clear, it's a fork.  Not a split.  And even then, nothing is happening to Bitcoin itself (not counting SegWit).  Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin, nothing changes.  You can ignore the fork completely if you want.  
It's like photocopying a $100 bill.  Nothing happens to the $100 bill, but a new document is created that isn't really a $100 bill... and probably will have more value than BCH ;)
