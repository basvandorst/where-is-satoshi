Supposedly the federal reserve controls that for all banks.  However, there is zero oversight for that over the federal reserve and those that control it.  In my opinion, the central bank does just what you are saying.  They are our masters.

How much does the differ usually give you for begging?

Until you change port 22 to something else and realize it doesn't even get hit any more.  Obscurity atop security is best.

Looks like we've got a central bank advocate here.  So the fed is audited you say?  Go find it.  I'm not talking about the "excel spreadsheets" they put out with the general expenditures either.  We want to know precisely where money is coming from and going to.  You see if you can't know the inputs, your money is a scam.  That's why bitcoin is so great.  You see all new units (the inputs) as they are created.  
Perhaps you're unaware that the central bank and all commercial banks create money out of thin air.  When they say their money is backed by the the central bank, they are talking about the fact that the central bank literally just creates money.

The federal reserve does not create money for the federal government unless you mean loaning it to them.  They create money for all kinds of reasons and loan it to many institutions.   


That's not how it works.  Why do you think they are called "Treasury" bonds?   You don't understand the relationship between the Federal Reserve and US Treasury.   The Treasury creates bonds and other securities that banks including the Federal Reserve can buy in exchange for the cash the Fed creates.  


This also isn't how it works.  Banks create their own money for the most part.   In fact the vast majority of money is created by commercial banks.
You should start here to understand how things work. 
  


Yes, an entity with godlike power should just be trusted.  Hey why don't you give me the power to create money at will and not audit me.  As a thought experiment, pick the worst person you know and imagine they had the power to create money at will and do whatever they like with it.  Are you comfortable with that?  In a year or two when this isn't just a pissing contest for you, come back to this thread and see if you still feel the same way.  I wouldn't trust my own self with that kind of power.  
The best way to think about it is the Federal Reserve is the dog and the Government is the tail.  The dog wags the tail and not the other way around.
