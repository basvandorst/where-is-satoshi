How do you know the price will rise again? Or did you just made that up?
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:33:44
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 17:50:50
This place is getting more worthless by the day. 
Why does it attract so many lunatics lately?
Bitcoin is slowly turning into the coin of choice for the conspiracy nutters and other crazies. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:01:53
"We need long confirmation times for the network to be secure therefore it can't be a problem" 
Ah yes, that solved the whole issue. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:16:27
He is right. This place is quickly turning into hangout for conspiracy theorists, teenage drug users and other crazies. 
Lots of people here are completely detached from reality.
Everybody who isn't 100% positive about Bitcoin is a paid shill. They think the whole financial world is shaking in their boots. Everywhere are secret enemies who try to take us down. And i could go on for a while. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 05:57:18
Who are these institutional investers, what is the price area they want to buy and how do you know?
@_date: 2014-08-11 08:40:38
I think you're completely missing the point. Your reply doesn't make any sense. 
You should smoke less weed, kiddo. 
Hilarious how people are downvoting me. They know i'm right and don't like it. So what else to do than to downvote me. 
Yes, that's how you live your life. Think about it for a minute. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 11:33:22
We know. It was posted several times 5 days ago. 
What does it take to stop the endless amounts of reposts here? How hard can it be?
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:41:17
Some of the topics here...
How old are you?
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:33:01
This is getting completely ridiculous. Sorry, i'm not playing these stupid games. 
You druggies completely lost reality. Sad. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:11:11
Yes we know you idiot. Normally you repost 1 to 3 days old news. This time 3 weeks. Congrats on the record. 
Can you please just stop posting. Every single post of yours is a repost. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:30:18
We know. 30 people before you posted it. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:13:51
Seriously, what is there possibly to downvote?
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:21:47
Funny how you got downvoted. They hate facts and reality here. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:37:14
No, they are here to help the Bitcoin community. The money is a secondary reason obviously. Not that important. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 10:27:25
I hate these kind of posts where the OP assumes that everyone knows what he's talking about. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:35:30
We know. It's been posted more than 30 times by now. Please stop. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:16:51
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:15:01
You are right but it doesn't solve the issue. All i see in this thread is people explaining why the transaction times exist. And nobody talking about the problem it creates. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:21:42
This has been posted about 30 times already. Can you please just stop?
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:24:37
Congrats. You made the same post as 5 other people before you. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:43:11
He is being charged for trying to have someone murdered. 
A small detail about your druggie hero everyone here seems to keep "forgetting".
@_date: 2014-08-19 11:10:01
Yes we know. We got it the first 10 times it was posted 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 15:11:39
Why does this place attract so many lunatics?
@_date: 2014-08-10 08:56:58
You really didn't notice this is an English sub. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 06:34:45
These people think the NSA creates secret projects and then give away hints in the name. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:21:41
Fuck me. You must see a lot of things in life that aren't appropriate then. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 07:36:58
Bitcoin is awesome but you are 100% right. 
This place often makes me cringe so hard. Exactly because of the reasons you mentioned. 
Bitcoin attracts conspiracy theorists, broke teens who think they will become rich with 1 coin, drug addicts and outcasts in general. 
Many people here are completely out of touch with reality. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:39:15
Just stop with the reposts. Please! How hard can it be!

"Goodie! I will soon to be able to buy a virtual meal with my virtual currency."
I understand he is trying to bash Bitcoin but what does it even mean? What exactly is this person thinking when he posted that?
@_date: 2014-08-14 07:13:26
As always the person who posts facts the cultists don't like gets downvoted. 
We've come to the point where you're not even allowed to mention Bitcoin is going down anymore without getting downvoted. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:13:18
Now that you showed a source he won't reply anymore. He will simply ignore it or downvote it and do the same thing in the next topic. 
This has being going on for months now. Reality is something a lot of people here can't handle.
Ross is their druggie hero and anybody who posts facts they don't like gets downvoted to hell. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 04:01:35
These posts are getting more retarded by the day. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:44:53
Anything reality makes them uncomfortable and gets downvoted to hell. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:12:51
I'd like to see you standing in a store waiting for 30 minutes after you bought your tv.

Wallstreet getting in AGAIN?
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:43:32
Wrong sub. 
Funny how those of you who post off topic news always say the same thing:
I realize this doesn't belong here but &lt;insert reason why the rules don't apply to you&gt;
In the meantime people like me have to browse through off topic shit all day while i come here for Bitcoin news. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 17:46:50
This is a Bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:47:07
I don't care what you think is relevant. Every day 2 dozen people here post off topic items because they think it's relevant. I and others come here for Bitcoin news. If we wanted general financial news we'd go somewhere else. 
I realize you're young and arrogant and think you know it all. But really, you're not that important. Just stick to the rules. They are there for a reason. People like you are that reason. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 07:17:16
You will lose money. 
A simple search would have shown you 300 topics saying the same thing. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 10:38:29
They will find out one day. When it's too late. And they will be crying here. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 10:35:32
Did you really think this wasn't post already?
@_date: 2014-08-16 05:16:20
Do you have some sources for all your claims?
@_date: 2014-08-11 06:18:09
Why would a band be interested in who's coming there. 
They want to get paid for their job. Just like every other person with a job. You don't seem to understand this. 
Would you ask a plumber to work for you for a tip because of the high-profile list of attendees?
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:56:23
Please stop posting the same thing every 10 minutes. When will you people learn. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:15:47
On grounds of being a total shit domain. And i'm pretty sure you are also aware of this. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 17:27:47
We know. We got it the first 20 times it was posted 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 04:31:41
I see. I'm not allowed to mention it's repost. Doing so means i will be downvoted to hell. 
So THAT's how it works here? Right?
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:05:39
The crazy conspiracy posts get worse by the day in this place. 
I wish these nutters would just stay in their corner of the internet.

@_date: 2014-08-11 08:10:37

@_date: 2014-08-26 04:23:10
Ah, so it is a problem. Now we're getting somewhere. 99% of the people here tell you the problem doesn't exist. Funny. 
And please stop with the credit card bs. I don't care how long it takes to confirm. If i buy something with a credit card the transaction goes through instantly and i can walk out of the store with my product.
No idea why you people always bring this up in these threads because it shows the exact opposite of what you are trying to say.
And according to you i can't point out the transaction times problem without getting downvoted because i don't have a solution myself? Seriously. 
Edit: you can also stop explaining why the transaction times exist. I know why they exist. It doesn't make the problem any smaller. You cultists always start to act so weird as soon as this problem is mentioned. That alone shows how big it really is. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 07:57:48
Messed up as it is i'm pretty sure plenty of people here would welcome a world war if it means their half a coin would be worth a lot. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 09:33:51
Yes we know. Really, you are not the first to post this. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:17:49
Because real shills put it in their username right. 
I really hope you aren't this stupid. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 14:01:53
We know. Just stop please. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:14:53
So that means they aren't in it purely for the money?
@_date: 2014-08-16 10:36:40
We know. You're a day late to post this. 
What does it take to stop the endless amounts of reposts here?

Funny how you complain people don't take this sub seriously. I wonder why that is. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 18:22:45
You must be confused. The is the Bitcoin sub. 
The mods even made a rule for it for people like you.

@_date: 2014-08-20 11:48:15

Your denying of facts and reality is getting more retarded with every reply you make. 
I don't think i have to explain how idiotic your example is right?
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:01:02
I somehow think they don't give a shit about keeping the network secure. I have a feeling they are doing this just to make money. Call me crazy.

@_date: 2014-08-17 13:35:28
Why not repost things till eternity then? There are always new people who didn't see it. Yes?
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:04:49
Correct. That doesn't make it less of a problem though. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 20:37:09
No, this is a Bitcoin sub. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:02:55
Oh right. It didn't happen. I just made that up. Ok, i got it. Not 1 Bitcoiner would ever do such a thing. It's all in my head. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:16:53
@_date: 2014-08-20 06:56:52
Won't happen because payment systems won't unknowingly let store owners sell a 10k car without zero confirmations. 
No matter how much you think it won't be a problem, it simply will be. And downvoting me won't change that.

No, it's a big problem. But you are not allowed to mention or discuss it here. You will get downvoted to hell.

@_date: 2014-08-10 15:53:12
Some retarded conspiracy theorists make a completely fucking stupid video full of nonsense and what happens?
Every damn Bitcoin news site picks it up and create sensationalist titles to sell it to the dumb stoner teens on Reddit. 
Look at the video! Look at the damn video! It's the most retarded thing i've seen this month! 
Why the hell is this posted 10 times here already?
What person who isn't totally insane thinks the cia creates a top secret project and then gives away hints in the name? Seriously, how simple minded can you be?
@_date: 2014-08-19 09:06:15
I wish the mods started banning people who post this nonsense. It's getting real old real fast.

@_date: 2014-08-11 10:47:09
"but mining farms like these are participating in the economy in a purely capitalist way (and the good kind of capitalism, not “socialism-for-banks-but-we’ll-call-it-capitalism-anyways”)."
What does this mean exactly? They're just trying to get rich? What makes this different?
@_date: 2014-08-25 15:54:39
If 10.000's of people a day are buying things it simply will be.
Just imagine standing in a tv store waiting 30 minutes for 1 confirmation to go through. It's not gonna work. And that's why the problem simply gets ignored and downvoted. That's how the Bitcoin community works. 
You are aware of this but act like the problem doesn't exist because you bought some cheap items over the years that didn't require a confirmation. Typical behavior here. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 10:37:11

Completely worthless. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 04:08:57
I checked the link. It's just a copy and paste from a yahoo article. Which is basically a copy and paste from the original idiotic piece. 
Just piss off with this bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 12:31:21
I hope someone hits you in the nose. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 10:15:10
No idea what it says but considering it's posted by you, an idiot conspiracy theorist, i'd say it's complete bullshit. 
Maybe it's time for you to step away from the computer. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:48:03
You are stoned right now, aren't you?
@_date: 2014-08-11 05:00:27
The stuff you people come up with....
Do you really believe this yourself? Students??
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:19:03
You failed so you want others to fail as well. Seen it 100's of times before. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:51:06
When will you stop reposting shit all day? Please man. Every single thing you post has already been posted before. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:55:46
What exactly goes on in your head that you think people here can look into the future?
@_date: 2014-08-12 05:06:43
People begging for pennies. How fucking broke do you have to be to lower yourself like this. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 17:15:57
Stop. Just stop. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:49:36
Huh wtf? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:26:19
You take political correctness to a whole new level. 
Do you realize it's a totally normal word? What the hell do you call the area between your back and legs then?
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:54:11
In these Ulbricht topics you are all pretty much the same. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 12:01:58
Fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:29:40
We got it the first 30 times this was posted. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 09:07:37
Not even interesting. Unless you are a braindead conspiracy tard. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 11:07:31
We got it the first 10 times it was posted. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 03:31:22
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 05:01:45
You want to pay 5 people 10 bucks each for probably a few hours of working?
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:30:17
Funny how that only works when it's someone you want to be innocent. 
If there would be a topic here about a banker who is being charged with screwing people over you and pretty much everyone else here would say he should be locked up without a trial.
The simple fact is you want him to be innocent because you use drugs and love bitcoins. Even if he is found guilty you will still say he is innocent. So your innocent until proven guilty is just a pathetic excuse. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 03:01:04
Moron. Get a fucking life. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 10:37:45
Yeah that's why we've seen people cheering here when all hell broke loose in Ukraine. That why we see people cheering here every time a country goes bankrupt. 
Sorry, your Bitcoin utopia is a fantasy. There are plenty of rotten apples here. The proof that you are 100% wrong has already been posted here, several times. 
But just ignore it. Downvote me like it never happened and keep acting like all Bitcoiners are all about peace and love and nobody would do such a thing. 
As always people here prefer fantasy over reality. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 04:50:34
Yes we know. 
Feel free to stop posting 2 days old news. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:01:16
Stop reposting the same shit all day long!
@_date: 2014-08-12 03:30:19
We got it the first 20 times it was posted 2 days ago. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 02:28:02
Get a job like everyone else. 
@_date: 2014-08-16 15:03:04
What is there possibly to downvote? A lot of you don't seem to understand what the purpose of the voting system is. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:59:24
Yes we know! We really do. Do you realize that every single post you make here is old news? Every single day!
Just stop posting man. Just save the energy. Nobody will miss a thing if you stop. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:59:31
Man, wtf are you on! Where the hell do you read i welcome a war? I'm saying how disgusting it is that people think that way. You don't have to fucking explain to me how fucked up a war is?
Seriously man. Knock it off with the weed. You're seeing things. Dumb fucking stoner kid. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 05:56:25
Soon this whole sub will be nothing but druggies posting conspiracy shit. It's getting worse by the day. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 10:26:29
Yes, but he was a genius. The people who post here not exactly. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:11:06
This is exactly what everyone always says in these threads. No idea why you are getting downvoted. 
The transaction times are simply a huge problem that gets totally ignored. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 08:05:31
Where is the Bitcoin part?
@_date: 2014-08-09 17:12:29
Just stop it man. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 17:15:42
I clicked this thread knowing there wouldn't be any proof posted whatsoever.
Wasn't dissapointed. 
You conspiracy losers are all the same. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 13:34:19
Ok, that's quite funny. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:33:28
It could happen 1 or 2 times but all this guy does every day is posting yesterdays news. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:04:04
Moron. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:23:29
Yes we know. It was originally posted here 2 weeks ago and then another 20 times more. 
Just stop. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 13:30:40
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:31:40
Could that "friend" of yours be you by any chance?
Idiot. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:38:06
Me too. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:50:23
Get a job man. Stop being that loser that spends hours to make pennies. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:07:28
No, that's not how it works. You made a claim so i don't have to prove anything. Instead why don't you back up your claim and prove me wrong. That is how it works. 
Oh and "i don't agree with you so you must be a troll" is as pathetic as it gets. Nothing in this thread comes even close to trolling. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 15:58:22
The downvoting already started 2 seconds after i posted it. 
Fine, downvote all you want but at least tell me where i'm wrong. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 09:53:26
In the Maryland case. It's even mentioned on the freeross site. But just keep downvoting me and all the facts and reality will magically dissapear. 
It's been explained over and over again that there are 2 different cases and that he is still being charged with murder for hire in 1 of them. At least 5 times in every big Ulbricht thread. Yet you druggies keep screaming and yelling the charges were completely dropped and anyone who says something else gets downvoted to oblivion. Must be nice living in a druggie fantasy world like that. You just accept and deny facts as you please. For some reason this seems to happen a lot on this Bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:46:00
Why am i being downvoted for posting a fact?
@_date: 2014-08-25 17:08:49
To the downvoters. Please at least tell me where i am wrong. Just downvoting because you don't like certain facts is kinda stupid you know. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 06:20:14
Coinbase is shady as fuck and will dissapear sooner or later. Why so many people here are licking their ass is beyond me. 
@_date: 2014-08-07 15:27:36
No. Because it was an obvious fake. Only a retarded 12 year old would fall for it. And the average conspiracy idiot ofcourse. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 09:15:47
I already told you that all your posts are reposts. Please just stop. Everything you post has been posted before. 
Every day when you wake and blindly copy and paste urls here of what you can find during breakfast is a waste of your and our time and energy. 
Just stop doing it. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:13:20
A bigot? Haha what the hell? Because i said there are some rotten apples in the Bitcoin community? You cultists are completely out of touch with reality. 
And what is "teach myself that a lot of people post on the internet" supposed to mean exactly?
@_date: 2014-08-18 12:16:04
We got it the first 5 times it was posted. Please just stop with these endless reposts. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 09:49:29
Stop posting your titles in caps. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 14:09:37
5 people a day post this thinking they are sharing some amazing wisdom. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 14:52:29
Not this shit again. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 13:54:10
That's why you search before posting. Not exactly rocket science, is it?
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:37:56
Can you back up this claim with proof that this was the case?
@_date: 2014-08-10 18:13:05
No. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:24:50
Stop spamming your shit man. Your articles are some of the worst of all Bitcoin sites. 
Nothing but sensationalist titles that lead to bs that looks like it's written by a 14 year old. 
@_date: 2014-08-17 01:46:45
No it didn't. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:14:46
A source has been posted many times already. Why would i do it again? You will simply ignore it. 
@_date: 2014-08-09 11:04:07
Hasn't this been discussed 40 times already since last year?
@_date: 2014-08-11 12:09:14
No way you are sober. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 05:52:55
"This is the best answer so far... we are probably going to have a bubble when college starts..."
No. At least not because of students. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 12:31:55
Sure, i believe you right away. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 11:33:59
Ah so it's impossible that anybody is in it purely for the money. 
Another cultist living in a Bitcoin fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 16:50:25
They "take Bitcoin complaints". It doesn't make any sense. Who complains about Bitcoin? 
If you lose your wallet or you gave your money to someone and that person dissapears with your money are you gonna complain about the US dollar?
"Hi yes, someone just stole my money. I'd like to complain about the Euro. Especially the 10 Euro bills because i lost a bunch of those". 
@_date: 2014-08-20 05:40:27
I do. But shop owners wont. They're gonna want to see that one (or more) confirmations before letting you walk out their store with a 2k tv. 
This will be a big problem when it comes to every day use. 
Pathetic how you downvoted me by the way. 
Downvoting things you don't understand or agree with is just so fucking stupid. 
@_date: 2014-08-23 07:32:11
You must be super rich right?
@_date: 2014-08-25 18:45:36
Can you point out exactly where i'm trolling?
@_date: 2014-08-19 10:25:15
Stop with all the reposts you idiot!
@_date: 2014-08-21 14:49:38
No. Just stop posting non-Bitcoin news here. The only reason you people post this shit here is to start a circle jerk. There is always some moron who responds with "Bitcoin user not affected". 
The mods made a rule for it. That doesn't mean let's break that rule to see if it gets deleted or not. It means this kind of news doesn't belong here. No matter how related you think it is. 
@_date: 2014-08-10 11:07:40
Where is Bitcoin mentioned in this article?
@_date: 2014-08-12 15:24:29
We know. It was posted here where you found it, then copied and pasted it to your site, then spammed it right back here with a stupid sensationalist title as click bait. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 12:24:13
How do you know there is no hard evidence? Did you just pull that out of your ass by any chance?
Edit: instead of downvoting me maybe one of you can show me exactly what evidence they may or may not have. But i don't expect this to happen.
