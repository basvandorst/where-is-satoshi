The ultimate trump card in any argument against an American.

Lol I just wanted to get the pun :P
And what do you have against Australia XD

Lol wut? I would've loved to get $100 in tips, no matter what the denomination.
My bank has a change counting machine.
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:14:11
Haha dude I'm American too and am getting along just fine. I just can't pass up a pun :P
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:12:16
Not quite. The person was saying the fees might rise (to $100 per transaction for example).
Imagine it as if every time you used your debit card, you had to pay $30 bucks to your bank as a fee. If you wanted a $10 shirt, you had to pay $10 for the shirt and $30 to your bank so that they would give your $10 to the store.

Someone who knows photoshop could do this _way_ faster than getting the cardboard, writing their message, dressing like a hobo, and having someone take a picture.

If you searched what a raspberry pi 3 is then you would see that it's a computer.

It's satire.
Have we stopped reading even the titles now?

But people will assume that it's still yours, because why would you transfer all your Bitcoin to somebody else?
And since Bitcoin addresses are anonymous, good luck convincing anyone you transferred your Bitcoin to someone else, even if you really did.

The parent comment by OP literally has a link to the software that runs the ticker.

Depends on where you live. Places where homes are increasing in value make it a good investment.

Yup, it's great that Senators/Representatives can focus on specific topics (in this committee's case, banking) but it also means that banks can easily donate to the specific lawmakers in charge of their industry.
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:36:07
So they're shorting Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-10 13:38:29
But at least you got something out of it, a profit I assume? That's still better than nothing, otherwise you'd just be beating yourself up for being dumb enough to lose the keys.

Even if you sold at 20k you would only have about 1.4 million dollars. But we all know you would've sold before it skyrocketed or you with still have it. You'd be rich, but not quite retirement worthy unless you really minimize your living expenses.
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:57:25
Well yes, I would consider living in a country such as India a way to minimize living expenses.
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:10:14
Well, looks like you called it.
@_date: 2018-06-28 11:24:21
Sure, and living in one of those countries is something I would consider as a way to minimize living expenses, like I said.
@_date: 2019-08-07 11:42:10
Technically they are still correct. Not _every_ country manipulates their currency.

I know atheists who are against abortion. It's a pretty easy case to say that fetuses are alive and it's logical to say that it's a person since it's obviously human.
I can get in trouble for kicking a puppy, but if I abort a fetus that will be a bona-fide human in a few weeks/months I don't have to worry about legal repurcussions. How is it hard to see why some people (even atheists) would think that's messed up?

What are you doing? Do you think you're on Facebook?
At least comment with "upvote" for goodness' sake.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:03:16
Yeah, but there are more people who _want_ to be selling. They can't because not enough people are buying, therefore they're willing to take a lower price, causing the overall price to drop.

It's $50 per anonymous donation. It's not a total for the whole campaign. That's such a laughably small number in terms of a Senate campaign that if it was the total they may as well just ban anonymous donations all together.

The Ethereum Blockchain has far more uses than cryptocurrency. I'm sure banks and financial institutions are interested in it for it's redundant record keeping and transaction verification abilities.
@_date: 2017-09-09 10:28:30
I think he means with contracts.
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:04:17
Does nobody here know that the blockchain can be used for more than cryptocurrency?
In this case it's clear what they want it for: a redundant and verifiable ledger system. The blockchain is valuable for more than just cryptocurrency, and one can believe in the power of the blockchain without believing in cryptocurrency.

In this episode of _The Office_, Michael is explaining a business opportunity that Jim says is a pyramid scheme. Michael denies it and draws an illustration of how it works with those lines (representing people IIRC).
Jim draws the pyramid around Michael's diagram to make them realize it's a pyramid scheme.

Google makes billions of dollars. I doubt they're phishing for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:17:45
Obviously you don't know what malware is.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:13:50
I think he meant he got phished and later he contacted the real shapeshift support line.

Looks like nobody has sent anything to the address yet (unless you changed it from the email). Hopefully the people currently investing in Bitcoin are smart enough to know that you should never send their coins to a random address.

Both are correct. The different sites are for different aspects of their business.

But if you always hodl so you can do more in the future, what is the point of hodling since you never use it?

The price isn't going to go up if people don't buy, and the difference this time is that people actually know about Bitcoin _and it's become synonymous with a bubble that cost people thousands of dollars_.
I'd be surprised if the price rises significantly. I hope that it'll become stable enough to use as currency, and that it'll catch on because of all the companies that started accepting it during the rise, but I'm not sure the public will trust it enough.
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:39:56
I don't get why people think it was _all_ FUD that caused the crash.
It was the fact that all my aunts and uncles who hardly know how to use a computer were "investing" in Bitcoin and were talking about how rich they were gonna be.
@_date: 2018-12-16 17:19:11
I never said cryptocurrency will go away. I just don't think it will be Bitcoin. Ethereum is the most likely currently existing one that could replace it. It's no less volatile, but the difference is that the average Joe only heard of Bitcoin.
Although I think the more likely scenario is that the general population will just end up using state-run cryptocurrency because they don't actually care about the decentralized nature of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-12-24 02:50:29
A bit over 4%
@_date: 2018-12-16 14:58:51
I think Bitcoin is valuable, but I don't think it'll be very successful anymore. Something else will probably take it's place that didn't drop from $19k+ to under $4k in a year.
Why go from one bad country's currency to one that plummeted like a rock?
I could be wrong, but all the people I know who were raving about Bitcoin this time last year (and there were a lot) are very bitter about it now.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:10:15
Good luck explaining that difference to the average Joe.
@_date: 2018-12-25 13:35:05
The whole point of Bitcoin is to be a currency (or "internet money" as you call it).
