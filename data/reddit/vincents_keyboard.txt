Beg to differ.
Google some critiques on SegWit or articles in favor or against blocksize increases.
Try choose articles which are away from your comfort zone, it helps shake ones world.
There's some really good articles floating around which go back two+ years.  Give it a go man, maybe I can give some links too if you're keen.
@_date: 2017-07-26 02:09:45
Your whole reply is loaded to the T, every second word is pushing at emotions and belittling.
I wonder what you're like in real life.  
A tough cookie no doubt.
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:54:22
Simple and secure is the best.  Let's keep it on chain with some bigger blocks.
Not altering the fundamentals.
@_date: 2017-07-29 06:48:37
Poor you.

Hey Luke,
When thinking of Bitcoin Cash, think reformation.
You'll love it. ;)
Also, wasn't it the protestant ethic which contributed to growth?  Sounds like a winner.
Then, many exchanges support Bitcoin Cash.  If anyone says otherwise it's a blatant lie.
You, you're spreading blatant lies.
@_date: 2017-07-29 23:12:03
You're spreading unnecessary fear, uncertainty and doubt.
Cash is king.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:19:58
I'd hold onto Bitcoin Cash, and buy more.
If I didn't support it, I'd still hodl it.
@_date: 2017-07-31 00:45:37
You guys are witty, gosh!
Do you give classes too?
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:29:20
Excuse me, who says the Core version will be "legacy".  A legacy of fools, maybe.
The legacy chain is the longest chain with the most hash rate behind it.
Everyone's more than welcome to put their money where their mouth is and decide which chain they hold to be "true".  That will in the end be called the "legacy chain", because it'll have the hash rate.
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:18:39
Benjamin man, it's no point trying. even thinks that there's 100k+ nodes in the system.
Right You're on the ball Ben.

Contrary to what everyone is saying here, I'll be buying BCC.  
This comes across not quite like panic selling on a dip, but panic selling on misinformation. 
Also, don't you find it mildly suspicious that votes are 9/10 times hidden here on the group?
Guess it means there's a silence majority that isn't having their opinions showed.

@_date: 2017-07-09 05:40:20
"ordinary people"?  7000+ nodes and potentially millions of users, and you're telling me ordinary people want to validate?  If ordinary people want to validate where are the nodes?  &amp; don't say block size, because where are Litecoins nodes?
Ordinary people make transactions, and ordinary people don't want to go through middlemen, the real ordinary people are being forced off-chain.
That's harm. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 05:50:57
Ouch, my ego..
By the way, have you found those nodes of yours yet?
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:04:51
It's subjective to decide what reward is sufficient.  Risk and reward will always be a thing.  They stuck it out and gambled.  
The gamble worked and the market can continue to decide the reward.  
Naturally the market is open, chip makers or people wanting to get into mining can set up shop.  But again, that's risk.  
@_date: 2017-07-10 07:06:45
To be honest, this is just terribly pessimistic.
There are similar examples in other industries.  Rather focus on the idea than on the field.
@_date: 2017-07-30 01:38:11
You go girl!
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:23:34
How is blocksize "hasty" and how may it "harm"?
Both are false.  Rather you use language which makes readers terrified.  
It took me some time to see through this language.  Particularly since stepping away from the community for so long.  I feel many in this sub have fell into a similar situation where the language skews judgement.
Not being belittling, however take a jump over to Google and search for Segwit/Lightning Network critiques.  It all eventually adds up.
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:00:58
Nope. Nope you're not.
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:12:48
Where's your answer?  Nowhere..
Funny story, first account ever.  And well worth it to cool that hot head of yours, sunshine. ;)

Lack of support.  False.
Now refer to my reply to (in 10min)

Thanks for the well wishes.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:39:29
100% agree with you.
Me saying "redditor for 3 months" was sarcasm.
Account longevity doesn't mean soundness.
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:07:41
Tell me, redditor for 3 months.
If people want to all run their own nodes, why is there only 7500+- nodes running?
Why, because people don't necessarily want to run their own node.  Keeping the limit will not necessarily increase the number of nodes, nor will increasing the block size limit (which is arbitrary).
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:34:16
Yeah, realise that doesn't look too great on paper.
Am certain if US requirements weren't as cumbersome US citizens would be able to participate freely.
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:11:24
So no, no you haven't found those nodes then?
Again, kid you not, this is my first ever account and well worth it.
@_date: 2017-07-28 01:14:23
My mistake.  Read the name wrong.
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:33:05
Again, have you found those nodes of yours yet?
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:16:22
There ain't no such thing as a free lunch..
@_date: 2017-07-25 01:44:16
You're 100% right, here's the best place to collect Bitcoin pictures.
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:49:59
Yes, the block size increase is practical.
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:15:18
Business is still open to set up shop in any country to produce the chips.  But it's risk.
Going with all the support for diversifying the chip market someone, or group or group of companies should set up shop.  There's apparently high demand, so why not?
@_date: 2017-07-27 23:33:08
Sounds like a big decision for an exchange to make on my behalf.
Poor form.
@_date: 2017-07-10 05:26:35
Tesla came out of nowhere
Bitcoin came out of nowhere
Google came out of nowhere
All these companies/groups didn't just have all the pieces of the puzzle ready.  They started the ball rolling, gained support, improved.
Now these are companies/groups people would love to be involved with and have on their resume (if that's what you want).  They draw talent.
Miners aren't the problem, chip producers aren't the problem, pointing fingers at how one wants a pie divided is troublesome however.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:36:13
With the same logic he's also saying it's good that exchanges support it, so people can buy it.
But he's not saying the above.
So, false, he is not implying what you say but is rather implying that there is little exchange support.
Now, refer to my reply to @_date: 2017-07-27 12:20:19
Well, last I bought was at around $400.
After the split, then see how things progress.
@_date: 2017-07-20 04:08:34
Yes it would be simpler.  But would it change anything? No.
Would it be simpler to add SegWit which changes the fundamentals of Bitcoin?  Most certainly not.
Block size increase is natural growth.
@_date: 2017-07-24 07:59:24
Try out the other sub, it's got more content vs what you generally see here.
@_date: 2017-07-10 00:57:22
80k+ nodes, sorry am I blind  ?
Again, if ordinary people want to validate where are the nodes?
Ordinary people want to transact, and if Core has their way this will be a thing of the past as transaction fees will force people (not sock puppets) off chain.
&amp; again, if ordinary people want to validate where are the nodes?
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:53:13
My accusation is, as you can see, that you're lying about exchanges not supporting Bitcoin Cash.
Here, take a look big boy 
You know what these exchanges represent in the ecosystem?  I do, and anyone not blindly following false narratives does too.
So, going back to the start.  You're telling blatant lies.
@_date: 2017-07-08 00:18:51
In everyone is just waiting to jump on the next "solution".
By chance, these solutions all sounds appealing in title alone.  
Hello "drivechains", too much huff and puff, the block limit is the solution.

There is an implicit statement in his message, "you need exchanges to support BMC if you want to dump it...".
Tell me what do the exchanges currently supporting Bitcoin Cash represent?
Does it represent what Luke implies, or does it represent otherwise?
I'll wait for your reply.
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:02:31
Bear in mind who took the original risk to begin with.  
@_date: 2017-07-10 03:48:54
Gosh, maybe I should create a website called 
But no need, lets take a looks at a handful of different websites which contradict your narrative.
eg 1: 
eg 2: 
eg 3: 
So, what's your approach now?  &amp; again, if ordinary people want to validate where are the nodes?
@_date: 2017-07-19 07:17:23
Does someone have a direct link to the website(s)?
Can't open Twitter behind the firewall..
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:19:46
It's open to everyone, however if you're a US citizen the US regulations make it troublesome for ViaBTC.
As a result they don't accept from US citizens.
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:58:32
a few things:
1. "LukeJR's comment is a truism - I you want to dump BCH, you need exchanges", and if that is truism, it means there are very few exchanges to "dump" Bitcoin Cash.  Which takes us to the point below.
2. You didn't answer my question:
"Tell me what do the exchanges currently supporting Bitcoin Cash represent?"
I.e is there exchange support for Bitcoin Cash, and how much?
Which leads to a rhetorical question being "Does it represent what Luke implies, or does it represent otherwise?", as you'll see his implicit statement is incorrect.
Granted, you're right on me not being the best in English, got 60% in school.
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:23:05
Yeah, so this is genuinely my first account.
But yeah, hopefully a few months down the line it's clear I'm not fibbing.

The posting limit is made by Reddit.  It's the same reason why I need to wait 10min to post here.
Further to that, why don't you guys show the moderation logs.  Lets all see what you've been stopping users from seeing.
