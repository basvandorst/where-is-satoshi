Very true and I was just speaking from the "official line" perspective. Not the 100% practical one.
I guess the bigger risk here is if you buy/trade enough and your info/name is shared with the IRS and you reporting nothing, is it more likely that you will be audited. In the Use Tax situation, I really wonder how they audit it.

You do if it got into your wallet as "payment" for "work" (mining) then it's income. The rate you convert it to USD at would then be considered selling an investment and whether it is a higher or lower value than when acquired would determine if it was a gain or loss. (This is my understanding and I'm not a pro) Essentially this would be the 2nd tax, but it's only on the portion of profit from the growth.

Great question regarding the timing. Maybe there are rules that simplify or average it for the day or week etc?
It is income though and technically taxable. Any incoming money is taxable even if that is you selling a toothbrush on craigslist for $2 locally in cash. Does that mean everyone reports it, not at all. Maybe it can wait until you sell or realize those gains, much like if a company gives you a stock, but then you would pay it on the entire amount since the gain is calculated by subtracting the purchase price from the sell price.

From what I've read, everytime you spend bitcoin you have to pay taxes on the gains. For example if you buy $1 in bitcoin and then that same bitcoin grows enough to buy a $100 gift card. You would need to pay taxes on the $99 of growth. This essentially would have to be done for every purchase. If you didn't need to do this, it would be a huge loophole for avoiding taxes by just using the bitcoin to buy things directly instead of converting it to USD.
