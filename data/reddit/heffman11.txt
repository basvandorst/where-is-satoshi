I feel this sub is more geared towards making capital gains. 
I can imagine a beautiful future where everyone is paid a basic living wage in cryptographic coins.

I'm in the same boat. Actually, 10k would finish paying off my debt from being jobless and  homeless. It was justified, I'm a single parent. 
My small investment into cryptocurrency is currently earning my in interested than my ridiculously high credit card apr's. 
Once this is all clear I can go back and finish my PhD and get out of minimum wage admin work.

Is there not a sub for bitcoin trading, similar to xmrtrader. 
Then we can keep this sub about the technology of bitcoin. 
It's great that the price is going up, but I see a vision of a world where we only use a cryptocurrencies, not changing back into fiat.

Me too, if I had 1 btc.

£10k would be nice. 
To be fair, I'm hoping my alt coins are hugely underpriced and they catch up with bitcoin.

I would have, but I don't have any money, it's all in crypto.

It would be paid by the blockchain.... 
You'd have solar powered mining factories owned by the elected officials to keep it going.

I just invested into this too. £20 was all I could manage. I split it between ethereum, Ripple and Bitcoin.

I wish I had more than 0.000004 btc.

I believe this is a pump and dump. The price of alt coins has generally been decreasing as people move into Bitcoin for the hard fork. 
The price is bound to drop at the end of November as these people move back into alts.

I've got some quality 100k memes if you wanna bump the price up.

We've made it to 6k GBP

Put your keys and password in some kind will so if the worst happens your family can still access them.

I will. It's in coinbase at the moment. I need to read up on withdrawal fees and decide the best time to move it.

Agree. Delete account. Delete all social media accounts. 
Use Google for answers, sell bitcoins at small quantities. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 08:44:18
1.2x10^-6 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:07:14
Its probably related to the millions of new coinbase users

I was so into monero
