I know we're all fucked, but one thing I don't quite get with this is how bfx will threat those with active loan positions.
It's one thing to split all assets across all accounts, but it's another to alter contract terms.  If I had btc or usd on loan to someone, they owe me repayment on that contract.  Closing these contracts after the hack is on par with users that made deposits after the hack.  If users that made late deposits are not socialized, then neither should funds closed on positions.

Zane just updated Mr.  Said if your btc was on loan, that is a good thing
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:57:23
There should be no major exchange in the world that would take those funds without asking questions.  Certainly not one large enough to liquidate all this.
The hacker will have to sell on a black market.  Even then, it is risky.  Someone who took a hit on bfx may discover a link back to the theif.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 13:25:22


I don't disagree with this at all.  What I disagree with is those funds taking a haircut twice.  The funds will take a haircut in the hand of the borrower, then repaid, then given a haircut again in the hands of the loan issuer.
I would really appreciate some long discussion on how margins are settled prior to everything being finalized.  
To argue my point further, I have a contract with another user for repayment.  If you make the payment in whole, then take those funds from me, it is no different than taking funds from someone that deposited after the hack.
I know it may be easiest to simply proportion funds across all accounts, but if you're simulating liquidation, I think more thought needs to be put into how contract closures are handled.  It is irrelevant to me where a borrower keeps funds or what they lose.  At the end of the day, I am legally entitled to full repayment from the borrower.  If I get cut after full repayment, I won't be able to legally pursue funds from the borrower.

If I had BTC sitting in my account, I'd be screwed.  I know that.
My one little glimmer of hope is that I had it all out on loan.  I'm just curious how BFX treats this.  IF the persons who took the loan sold it (like they're expected to) and have that cash on hand, I stand at least a decent chance of recovering something if those persons are held to repaying their loan to me.  
The opposite is true for people loaning cash.  If you gave cash to someone to buy BTC, and that BTC is now gone, the borrowers have nothing to liquidate to repay the loan.

They should all get polygraphs
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:15:13
What is BitGO's purpose then?  Why do they exist?
The idea was, they would do more than blindly signing all transactions when given a transaction request and API key.  
In the old BFX setup, they had maybe 5% of their funds in a hot wallet.  If their hot wallet got low, there was a process for moving funds from cold storage to the hot wallet.
With the BitGO integration, I had the false assumption that BitGO would prevent more than 5% of all their collected funds from moving to a non-shared address.  If more than 5% moved (in a single day), BitGO would stop signing transactions until there was a manual process of allowing additional transfers.  I came to this poor conclusion as I've had transactions stuck for many hours before.  There is no way that would happen if there were no transaction limits. 
But, instead, the limit here seems to have been set incredibly high.  Perhaps as high as 50%.  And instead of doing any sort of hourly check (aka, 2% per hour), the 50% rate was per day.  
For BitGO to allow this sort of setup is irresponsible.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:16:52
To me, BFX and BitGo shared thousands of addresses.  If BFX was moving from one multi-key address BitGo had a key to to another multi-key address BitGo had a key to, then no problem.
But, if we're moving from a multi-key both parties share to an unknown address, it seems like an extra verification step should be present.  Like, hey BFX, have the user give me a second 2FA key, one you don't have access to.  OR, give me a signature using a master private key that you've told me is in cold storage.  
I don't get how BitGO allowed transfer of coins to an unshared address without an additional layer of security.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:25:45
Who gets the IOU though?  
This is my opinion.  Only works if current market price stays below ~620 though.
There are 6 different positions using BFX.  
1) Someone with cash.  This includes people who loan cash but have no contracts open along with people who have cash to purchase BTC.
2) Someone with Bitcoin.  This includes people who loan btc but have no contracts open along with people who have btc to sell for cash (or shit coin).
3) someone in a margin position to long btc (they have btc, borrowed cash)
4) someone in a margin position to short btc (they have cash, borrowed btc)
5) someone with cash loan contracts
6) someone with btc loan contracts
There can obviously be a combination of situations for each user.
My vote is to do the following:
A) nullify all BTC short contracts.  Although these should be making bank, close them for what they were taken out for.  In theory, BFX can will pick up money doing this at the expense of the shorters.  Sorry shorters, but no profit for you off this terrible circumstance.  (Group 4 is dealt with)
B) Return BTC back to the people who have open loan contracts.  This BTC will come from the people in group A.  (Group 6 is dealt with.  Part of the theory here is, if group 4 didn't make money, BFX capitalizes on the lower current market price, making it possible to rebuy BTC from other exchanges with cash left over)
C) Close BTC margin longs.  These people got wrecked.  Sorry group 3.  You're probably at a total loss for going margin long when the market took a dive.  But, you took some responsibility in gambling on margin long.
D) Use all cash savings from C and A to pay back group 5 (those who have open contracts loaning cash).  This may come up short.  IOU's may be needed to make up the difference.  BFX may need to increase fees and offer a payback over many years.  
E)  People with a cash balance should be safe as no cash was stolen.  Group 1 saved.
F)   People with BTC just sitting in the account are SOL.  This includes people offering BTC loans for short with no open contracts.  BFX will have to offer a multi-year repayment plan, coming out of pocket up front as much as possible.  
As with all plans, some will love this, others will hate it.  The group that is punished the most are those with BTC just sitting on the exchange.  The group that is punished least is the ones with cash sitting on the exchange.  
Another option is to punish all equally, using the cash available to make each account as whole as possible, but I don't like that as it punishes those with cash positions.  
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:31:03
I hope that is the case.  Loaning btc is a form of hedge.  If those with open btc loan contracts have to take a haircut when they get repaid, it defeats the purpose of the hedge.  This is especially stupid if those making btc deposits after the hack don't take a haircut as the loan repayment/settlement would take place after their deposits.

I just hate how margin positions are being treated.  A person Loaning funds are seeing those funds get two haircuts.  The first haircut comes when the borrower closes their loan position, the second haircut comes after those same funds get repaid.  
I'm sure borrowers are happy all share equally in the pain, but that isn't how it should work.  Loan positions should be closed, the hair cut given to all, then lenders should take payment.  BFX coin could then be used to settle any repayment that cannot be made

Zane.  Even though I have no cash and only btc in the exchange, I can understand socializing losses only for btc holders.  
Those who had open contracts to loan out their btc should not have their settled coins added to the socialization.  Loaning BTC is a hedge to get out of a risky asset and into one assumed more stable.  Socializing any loan repayments to these individuals completely defeats the purpose of the hedge.  Unless all forms of balances are being socialized, these hedge positions should be protected like cash is being protected.  
If you socialize the loan repayments, you should socialize everything.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:34:18
I hate to keep asking, but what about BTC that was loaned out?  It seems like that would work opposite of cash margin loans.  
If I loaned 10 BTC out, does that BTC stay in my wallet, or does it move to the wallet of the person taking out the loan?  I'm keeping my fingers crossed that you're going to tell me the BTC moves, and I get an IOU in return.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:15:10
How does this affect those loaning btc and usd?

I think bfx coin will work out better than the naysayers think.  My guess is that in 3-6 months, they will be selling for significantly more (around .6 ea)
If bfx is sacked with lawsuits, I'll be wrong
If not, if those sueing either get paid off or can settle (better than bankrupcy where all assets go to lawyers), bfx will start doing market limit orders maybe as high as 1.01 +1% per year as they pull in more profits, and bfx buyers now will profit.

@_date: 2016-08-03 14:43:04
I'm still mostly pissed with BitGO.
I can understand if BitGO was automatically signing transactions that moved funds from a known BFX key to another BFX key.  I get that.  It's just an internal shuffle.  
But, if BitGO is signing transactions that move BTC from BFX to an unknown address (out of the users wallet), why not contact the user first and ask if it's ok?  What good is a third party if they're just going to push through all transactions that get sent their way?
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:14:30
In my case, 100% of my BTC was on loan.  The bulk of it had been for 2 days.  Some of it was more recent, but I'm fairly sure it was done before the hack.  
The price was falling over the past 2 days.  Certainly that plays in my favor.  


This part is what I'm holding out hope for.
I'm not putting any bets that it's 100% all there, but at least I had a few things working for me.
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:38:03
This still leaves many questions
If everyone is taking a 36% haircut, that means roughly 60% of all bitcoin is gone.  How will bfx obtain  coins to make up for accounts that lost it all?  Or, will they be credited cash for whatever bitcoin they're missing?

Basically, the system needs a way to make it very difficult for someone to rewrite the accounting ledgers.  Imagine two almost identical accounting books placed before you, except that one book says MyAccount has $1,000,000 dollars in it while the other book says MyAccount is $0.  Which book is true?  
In Bitcoin, the book that is true is the one that has solved more complex math problems.  It gives proof that more computing effort has been put into that set of accounting books.  Given how the math works, it is very easy to detect an accounting book that is trying to fake having more problems solved or easier problems solved and thus pass itself off as being genuine.  
In order to make the accounting book that shows MyAccount with a balance of $1,000,000 be the true book, I'd have to do a lot of math problem solving, which requires an abundance of computing power that would be much more expensive than $1,000,000.  Therefore, it would be impractical to try to change the books.  This is called 'proof of work' and is what makes Blockchain technology secure.

Piggybacking on this, I had btc out on loan.  Technically, those btc have not even been credited back to me yet.  Some time in the future, those coins will be added to my account as the loan is repaid by those in cash.  Those coins should not take a haircut either.

When these coins eventually start finding their way onto the major exchanges (and they will if they're ever truly spent), it will kick off an immediate Hansel and Gretel style investigation to track down the exact path they followed to get there.
Frankly, I think it would be neat to see a site that is dedicated to tracking where these coins move to.

What I don't understand is this.  There were thousands of multikey addresses bfx and bitgo shared.  If bfx was asking to move funds from a multikey address they both owned keys to to an address bitgo didn't have a key to, why not get 3rd party conscent first?
Bitgo was authorizing funds to be moved from a users account to a non bfx address without consent of the user.  What a terrible policy.
Also, there should have been a daily spend limit.  No way, even if bfx argues against it, should bitgo authorize such a large portion of their total holdings to be moved in a few hours.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:03:55
The counter party currently has cash and cash is not affected.  Bfx is not the counterparty.  When users borrow my btc, it is automatically converted to a cash position.
There are users that deposited btc after the hack.  Those users feel they should not have to be socialized. Those that loaned btc havent even been credited their btc back yet.
If someone somehow doesn't have enough cash to settle at 603 per coin, then yes, that is a loss for the person loaning

At minimum, it should also have an email confirmation.  So, the attacker would have had to gain access to the server, gained access to the 2FA code, and gained access to email account that was registered with BitGO.  
Even if the attacker could log in to see the settings with his 2FA key, it should still take a second 2FA key to make changes.  
I don't have any experience with interfacing with BitGO, but I can't imagine their control panel was only protected by a username/password.
That seems like either an inside job, or an unreal level of hacking/social engineering.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:45:33
The whole design seems to be shit.
BitGO should have never authorized coins to move from a multisig wallet they had a key to to an addresses they didn't control without the approval of the end user.  BitGO should have never let 60% of mutually owned coins be moved to an address they didn't control within 2 hours.  Absolute fucking disaster on their part.
BFX hiring these clowns, touting their abilities, while letting their server be completely breached is just bewildering.  
@_date: 2016-08-02 21:17:47
As a side to all this...  could be nothing.  I could be the only one.
I have BTC on BFX that I loan out for interest.  I assume many others do the same.
I noticed over the past week or so that a few of my margin positions were not acting appropriately.  For example, I have auto-renew set for 30 days, .0075, but I logged in this AM to find positions that would expire in 'one month' at .0044.   Those positions, afaik, were not there yesterday.  So, it is almost as if they auto-renewed at a lower rate.

I guess at 10x margin, it would be closer to a 7k reserve.
Even then, the position closes with the borrower nearly doubling their cash position before taking a 38% haircut.
Really, what is important to me is how short btc positions will be closed and cut.  Seems like you'd close the position, cut 38%, then repay the 100 btc.
And if we do that, does the person getting 100 btc back also take a 38 btc cut?
What happens if someone borrowed 100 btc at 605, has the position closed at 600, and the cut takes place before the repayment.  Seems then that the person loaning is short paid then may also share in a hair cut on top of the loss.
@_date: 2016-08-06 20:04:44
I'm sure everyone feels terrible.  Nobody likes the situation.
Those shorting btc on margin are most likely comming out better than the lender.  Imagine this.
I have $50.  With only $50, I can margin short 100 btc for multiple days.
With a drop of $60 per coin, margin shorter in this case profited $6k before the haircut.  When their position closes, they will take a haircut, but still profit greatly.
Meanwhile, if the person Loaning 100 btc has to share in the haircut and lose nearly 34 coins after settlement, that seems like a really unfair for the borrower to come out so far ahead
@_date: 2016-08-07 00:54:12
Did I have funds on the exchange at the time of the hack?
My understanding was that those loaning btc had funds transfered from them to the borrower.  Loaners don't have funds, they have contracts for repayment.
That repayment will/did come after the hack.  
There are obviously many ways to look at it, but loan issuers did not have funds on the exchange but ious from borrowers
Also, as an example, user 1 loans btc worth 1000 to user 2.  User 2 liquidates to cash.  Between those two accounts, how much money is on bfx?
The answer not 2000.  
I'm expecting you to say those ious are socialized, but I have to fight for my position like everyone else.  Contracts/ious are generally not considered negotiable instruments unlike cash and crypto

Per my understanding, it was on loan for other people to exchange for cash (or alt coin).  If this was done the way I hope, it would have worked something like this:
I give you 10 BTC in exchange for an IOU.  That IOU is for BTC + interest.
You take the 10 BTC, sell it, hold cash, and then buy back the BTC either A) when you want to, B) when margin called, or C) when the contract expires.
Either I'm holding a bunch of IOU's from people that have sold my BTC for cash, or BFX was lazy, kept the BTC in my wallet, and never transferred balances.  If the latter, I have no clue how that would work.  How does the person who borrowed sell my BTC?  How does the person who bought my borrowed BTC withdrawal?  This whole debacle is about everyone having individual multi-sig wallets, so if BTC was never being moved between wallets during margin lending, then i'm at a total loss.

Hey zane.
I want to run this by you as I know you're still considering all scenarios.
For margin trading, let's say there was a user with $100 in his account that margin shorted 100 btc.  With very small interest rates on btc shorts, this is possible.  Also, we had prices in the high 600s just a few weeks ago.
With what I've seen, the margin shorter will profit on the order of around 6000 before taking a haircut on a total account value of 6100
Meanwhile, the person who gets his 100 btc loan back (which may not even be closed yet) will lose 34 coins
So, to recap, shorter comes out about 4k ahead while lender is down. 38% of his coins.
Doesn't seem right to me.

I think the % fee will be higher than some expect.  Large nodes are taking significant risk by having coins in a hot wallet.  .1% on several million in transactions each year is a nice profit for a home business that requires little work. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 10:13:13
If you run a node from home, the whole point will be to tie it to as many frequently used nodes as possible.   If you had 1000 channels to stores like starbucks, amazon, home depot, etc, you would get routing traffic if your fees were decently low.  Then it becomes a game of keeping the node operational, secure, and up 24/7.

I'm not sure I follow your last mile comment.
As I'm still learning the specifics, I'm curious who has to pay to close a channel and how much they have to commit to closing.
Example, I have a large node and Alice asks to open a channel where she has 1 btc and I have 0.  She pays .99 btc, and my node forwards the payment.  Alice never uses lightning again.  That channel now has funds that are now unprofitable for me.  The fee Alice paid for use of my node may only be .0001 btc.  If i broadcast the transaction to free up my funds, does the fee come from Alice's remaining .01 balance, or am I on the hook for it?
Also, fee management on channel closings seems risky.  Say Alice broadcasts an old transaction state, and I can't take justice because the fee isn't high enough to be put into a block in time.

Yes.  The nice thing is, bitstamp could also receive money to that channel, and they'd be receiving it all the time.  So, despite being used frequently, bitstamp could get a ton of miles out of that channel if the channel value was high enough.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:08:15


This is only partially true.  It is very possible to keep a channel open for very long periods of time.  Certainly, someone will close the channel to collect their BTC on chain at some point, but channels can be held open far longer than I believe you're giving it credit (up to years at a time).  I just learned this in the past few hours and it doesn't seem to be widely understood here yet.  
Lets say Alice wants to pay David .01 BTC on Lightning, but Alice doesn't have a direct channel with David.  It would be very expensive to open a new channel with David directly, and most people think the story dies here.  But, it doesn't.  You see, Alice has a channel with Bob, who is very well connected, and serves as a large hub on the lightning network.  On this channel, Alice owns .1 BTC and Bob owns .1 BTC.  As luck would have it, Bob also has a channel with Carl (another large hub), and Carl has a channel with David.  Alice, through the magic of how lightning works, can pay Bob, who in turn pays Carl, who in turn pays David.  Bob and Carl both collect a small fee (which is why they act as large hubs), but David ultimately gets paid and Alice is out Bitcoin.  The channel states  between Alice and Bob, at the end of the day, are Alice .09 BTC and Bob .11 BTC.  The channel state between David and Carl is David +.01 BTC and Carl -.01 BTC.
What is really mind blowing , and why I say you're technically wrong on your statement above, is that Alica can get paid back!  That's right, let's say Erin owns Alice .01 BTC.  Through the reverse of the above, Erin can route her payment through the lightning network such that Bob and Alice update their channel state to where Alice now has again .1 BTC and Carl .1 BTC.    Fees, of course, would be subtracted over time, but the lesson of the story is, your channel state with a large hub can actually gain value and not just lose value.  If your initial channel balance is large enough, and if you're getting paid via lightning just as you're spending via lightning, you can get a ton of miles out of a single channel.

The reality is, a large hub still has finite resources.  The way networks work, when large hubs connect to other large hubs, you can basically get to anywhere in less than 7 hubs.  Think of airports.  Atlanta has the largest airport in the world, but it doesn't fly everywhere.  But, no matter where you fly out of, you can get to where you're going in less than 7 stops, though you'll probably be routed through a few large hubs along the way.

So, this is what is stupid to me.
You have a multi-key system.  Bitgo has 1, Bitfinex has 1 hot and 1 cold.  
Bitfinex calls up Bitgo saying 'hey, sign this transaction to move coins from one of our users multi-sig wallets'.
Bitgo, WITHOUT CONTACTING SAID USER, proceeds with signing the transaction.  
If you're acting as a 3rd party to authorize moving money out of my account, shouldn't you fucking contact me first?
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:30:11
Perhaps.  But, what happens when that large hub decides to charge 2% fees?  With node competition, fees are driven down.  Plus, who wants to depend on a single node to work for the entire network to function?  Plus, what node would possible have enough funds by itself to cover all use cases?

It's not a fork.  No clue how fast adoption will take.  
As a quick rundown on how lightning works, it's basically like keeping a tab at a bar.  You give the bar keep your credit card, you run up a tab, and at the end of the night, you settle.  This has many benefits.  1, the bar keep can batch transactions.  It would be costly to run each card individually (30 $1 drinks, for example, each with a minimum $.05 fee per transaction), but easy to do one large purchase (1 $30 tab for all 30 drinks, with only a single $.05 fee).  2, it saves time.  Imagine if, between every drink, the bar keep had to run your card, get the receipt, have you sign it and add tip, re-enter all that info, etc.  It's much faster to just just run a tab. 
This works because you can sign transactions and not broadcast it to the blockchain.  It's basically a contact for payment system that can be sent instantly and amended instantly, and batch settlements are done on chain just like a bar tab.  Millions of these contract swaps can happen per second with lightning.

If Amazon sends payment through LN, they are likely to utilize the carl-&gt;Amazon channel.  Carl would likely have a large channel balance with Amazon so he can collect lots of fees and Amazon would use him for sending payments.  Thus, Carl gets back money on his Amazon channel.
Also, Carl could set a routing fee of 100% to discourage using his channel.

I feel like I have a gap in my knowledge about lightning.
It seems like a channel is between 2 people only.  I see it working like this.  I can open a channel with Starbucks for $100, make (20) $5 transactions anytime I want, basically for free, and instant, but there appear to be a few downfalls.
1) The effectiveness comes from users ability to prepay.  If there is a channel for every merchant, putting up $100 per merchant seems impractical.  This is especially true for more expensive retail locations, such as for shoes, clothes, etc, where a channel needs 1k+ to be useful. 
2)  It seems like the ability to spend coins on a channel is not possible without closing the channel.  Maybe that is ok, but if channels have to close every 30 days because vendors need to spend their money, it seems like channels lose a lot of their value.  That is, unless there is a 3rd party involved that acts as a middle man, taking a fee, but allowing your channel to stay open for a year at a time.
Help me understand what I'm missing.  I get how the speed works, but how cash flow will be viable still eludes me.

Roughly 4 years ago, the supply rate was double what it is now, but the price in USD was between 200-1200 depending on your time frame.  When the rate got cut in half, the price did much more than double.  We've gone from making 720k-3.6MM USD of coins per day to, at the current price, roughly 17 MM USD of coins per day.  When demand increases, and new supply starts really drying up, it will be glorious.  We're less than a year away.

An easy but not 100% accurate comparison is to how you play black jack at a casino.
Imagine if for every blackjack hand played, you had to make a bank withdrawal to bet and then a bank deposit if you won.  The bank would eat you up in fees and the whole process would be incredibly slow.  This is similar to on chain bitcoin transactions.
So, what casinos do is offer casino chips.  You pay for these up front, and again when you're done, but it greatly speeds up all transactions for not only blackjack, but any other casino game that takes chips.  Values are shuffled around nearly instantly.  This is the lightning network.  It allows you to make transactions off chain with a guarentee to settle on chain (aka, with your bank) later.  Its faster with reduced fees, but still in development, so be cautious of using it.

Here is the problem.  Say your btm costs 20k.  The first btm's were selling for 50k, so let's assume the price has come down some.
You have the btm set for 1% fees.  You take 50k cash a month for purchases.  At $500 profit a month, less whatever you have to pay rent to the company where it is placed, it will take 40 months minimum, or just over 3 years *to break even* on your machine.
The risks associated with btms are fairly high at the moment.  Banks can shut you off.  Btms have been known to be the target of theft.  At 50k a month cash flow, you'll have to empty fairly regularly, which almost isn't worth the $500.  
All this changes when fees are 10%.  Suddenly, the payoff time for the machine is much faster, and there is good financial incentive to have one.  As long as people are paying the fees, which they will, because 10% is worth avoiding kyc in many instances, then fees will stay high.

The 'rate' is .027%, but you still have to find someone who wants to take out a loan at this rate.  .027% just represents the value for which the last loan was taken at.

Normal.  A little extra explanation though as it does seem strange.
In the beginning, Bitcoin needed a way to distribute the currency.  This was done through mining blocks.  Currency was not given at random, but given based on proof of work.
But, in the beginning, there were very few transactions.  How can you distribute currency if mining is dependent upon transactions taking place?
The solution is, allow miners to mine 0 transaction blocks.  While not ideal for the network at this point in time, it allows the currency to be distributed independently of the number of transactions being requested.

There is a water shortage situation going on in California.  Enough clean drinking water is hard to come by there, so we have a scarcity problem.
But, water is simply a molecule of H2O.  There are trillions of these molecules for every citizen in California.  It can be subdivided nearly infinitely.  So, why is that water there is still considered scare?
That is because one molecule of H2O is not sufficient for quenching thirst.  Similarly, one hundredth of a Satoshi is not enough to buy groceries for the week.

My biggest fear in all of this isn't what will happen with this update, but with the next update.  Imagine a situation where Coinbase accepts 8MB blocks, but Bitfinex and Bitstamp do not.  Imagine Electrum and Blockchain.info update to 8MB blocks, but Mycelium and LBC does not.  Now imagine it's 2030, the system has a $500B market cap, and we find ourselves debating once again to raise the cap.  It would be disastrous at that stage of Bitcoins growth.  We would once again be forced to turn to the very few people who are capable of pushing the change to make decisions for the many.  
BIP100 is very risky.  Perhaps it is too risky to implement.  I'd like to study it more.  But, the major advantage of BIP100 is that it will resist future civil war conflicts.  Unlike having everyone vote by installing a specific version of the client, BIP100 (from my understanding) allows anyone with hashing power to vote.  And either you have enough votes to force everyone to change, or you don't.  The option to hard fork doesn't go away with BIP100, but it is the only way I've seen presented that would eliminate the future need to hard fork all together.  If we change to a hard 8MB cap tomorrow, we have effectively kicked the can down the road just a little further.

You keep treating a fraction of a Bitcoin as if it were a full Bitcoin.  They are not the same and cannot be compared as if they were.  Just because it may be easy to obtain one trillionth of a Bitcoin (thus, one trillionth of a Bitcoin is not scarce) does not make it easy to obtain 1 MBTC (meaning a 1000 whole Bitcoins is considerably more scarce).  If you don't think there is any scarcity to Bitcoin, then go out and obtain 1000 of them to show me how easy they are to come by.

This is my first time seeing it in 3 months since I've used their service.  I've had delays as well.  What is strange to me is, I received a confirmation email saying the transaction was approved, and while it was processing, it was suddenly marked 'pending review'.  
It's been held up so long, I had to make other arrangements.  I'm hoping support can cancel the transaction as part of the review process.  I've emailed them requesting this, but I have no clue what will come of it.
I've also made 2 withdrawls (one of which was for a higher dollar amount) after this one got held up.  Both with threw without delay.

The lead developer of the Bitcoin protocol has responded to my menial reddit comment.  What a glorious day!
While I'm on a roll, I think you're really onto something with letting miners essentially vote on increasing the block size.  I only see one possible pitfall.
If, for whatever reason, it becomes economically advantageous for a miner to keep the block-size cap low, what recourse is available?  The answer is, the miner must intentionally create as many 0kb blocks as they can to optimize their vote and thus influence the max cap calculation.  This would not be desirable by anyone who uses the protocol.  
I would rather separate work output from a vote to increase, decrease, or stay the same.  A miner should be allowed to fill a block while simultaneously voting to reduce the cap size.  
It seems like this could be done with an optional input parameter mined into each block.  If the parameter is missing, it would essentially be a vote to stay at the current cap.  Whatever vote has the majority over the past 144 blocks would determine the new cap.  A majority vote to increase raises the cap by a factor of 1.5 from previous, a majority vote to decrease lowers the cap by a factor of 1.5 from previous, with a minimum cap of 1 mb.  Custom voting functions could be written by each miner, and the default voting pattern would be to look at the average fill rate of the past 144 blocks and vote to increase if over 80% full and vote to decrease if under 30% full.  
Thank you for all you do Gavin.  If there is ever anything you need from this community, please let us find a way to help.

Socialism does imply a redistribution of wealth though.  It is not quite on the same scale as communism, but there is certainly a large range in which socialism can look more like capitalism or communism.  A $25 minimum wage, I say, swings much more heavily toward the communism side of things.  You can only increases taxes so much and increase the minimum wage so high before you effectively have a full fledged communist economy.

Scarcity, by definition, means difficult to obtain.  
It is difficult to obtain whole Bitcoins.  It is not difficult to obtain extremely small fractions of a Bitcoin.  Thousands of US dollars are difficult to come by, but pennies can be found randomly scattered throughout parking lots.  Just because a penny is easy to obtain does not make USD a non-scarce resource.  There is a very real limited quantity of USD and BTC that holds any meaningful value.  Until this status quo changes, both resources can be considered scarce.

This is not a slippery* slope fallacy.  A 100% tax rate is in fact slavery.  When old plantation farmers had slaves, they paid them no money, but provided them with some shelter and food to keep them productive.  A 0% tax rate, which we had at one point in time, was absolute freedom.  If I'm being taxed at 40% of my paycheck, and I only receive 20% of my paycheck in return benefits, then I am being made a slave 20% of my work week.  The logic follows absolutely and infallibly.  You are bending your mind in order to support your narrative.  
Furthermore, if the left can call minimum wage "wage slavery", then I am certainly able to use it in the context here.

I'm not sure mining economics can be so simplistically explained.
What if a miner somehow has very cheap access to electricity, but bandwidth is a problem?  What if, in their own internal calculations, they find that small blocks allow them to profit more than having to receive large blocks?  Now, to really dig their heels in, they must try to produce 0 transaction blocks, even at the cost of losing transaction fees, in order to get their way.
Miners are effectively voting to change the block cap with every block they mine.  I believe these two things should be separated.  The BIP100 proposal seems to do this, and it also future-proofs the system at the cost of a little added overhead.  To abandon BIP100 and to go with a cap calculation approach has too many unknown variables for my liking.  I'd rather those with a heavy investment in hashing power get to empower their opinion through voting.

The only way they could sell otc would be to offer a huge discount.  The buyer would have the leverage, knowing bitmain couldn't sell on market without massive slippage due to thin liquidity.

So let's just say BCH was on block 1000 right now.  They're mining block 1001, meanwhile, the attacking pool publishes blocks 990 through 1010 with equal or higher difficulty than the normal chain.
You're telling me that every node is going to instantly reject this new and longer chain?  That seems impossible.  I know of no part of the standard protocol that calls for rejecting a chain if it split more than n+ blocks ago.  But, maybe you can point me to where that filter happens.
If the new chain is only rejected by bitmain, and they switch hashing power to catch up, it should theoretically take 100+ minutes to do so based on bchs difficulty algorithm.  Thats over an hour of mass chaos in the bch network.

I hate it.
Why?  Because if you are a miner with a desire to keep block size limit low, what is your recourse?  The answer is, to produce as many 0 transaction blocks as possible to keep the size down.  We all know what happens to our grades in school when you get a bunch of 0's, and this behavior devastates the network.  Voting to change the block size limit must be separated from filling a block.  Those who wish for a smaller block size must be able to vote to keep it small while simultaneously filling blocks.


This is exactly what your proposal does.  Only miners have any influence over what size blocks are produced.

If you say US dollars are scarce, then Bitcoin is also scarce.  It has nothing to do with how small of denominations USD goes to.
Consider this.  If USD was as hard to come by as a whole Bitcoin, what would stop someone from taking a penny and cutting it into 10 slices?  Or 100 slices?  What if merchants, so desperate to receive USD, decided to take these mere slices of money in exchange for goods and services?  Perhaps a house even?  There is absolutely nothing to stop anyone from doing this, except that US dollars are not scare, so there is no need to go to this extreme.  
Or, if you don't like my previous scenario, what about this one.  Lets say I invent a new digital currency call BitUSD.  In it, every one hundred trillion BitUSD would buy you one penny.  There are 10^18 units of BitUSD in circulation.  I have effectively added to the amount of units of USD currency in circulation by 10^18 via an electronic side chain to USD.  Now, anyone can have trillions of electronic 1/(10^10) pennies.  Would this act now make USD not scarce?  I mean, anyone can own trillions of 1/(10^10) pennies, so now you can't call it scarce anymore, because there are just so many of them.  
That's all I'm going to say about it.  if you still don't agree with me, then it's ok.  Just do me a favor and say you don't agree so we can both move on to other things.

Early bitcoin explainations made the statement that bitcoin miners solve mathematical problems.  While that is true, the statement lacks some finesse.  It is important to understand that some mathematical problems can only be brute forced.  To check if a number is prime, for example, has no mathematical formula, but requires checking division by all numbers in the domain.  This is essentially what bitcoin miners do.  They brute force solutions to a nonce value such that the resulting block hash meets a predefined rule set.  The problem starts over with each block as the hash output solution of the previous block is included as the header of the next block.

Buffet likes stocks, and rightfully so, because imagine the following scenario:  there is a flash crash of Facebook stock tomorrow and you can buy the whole company for $1.  Keep in mind, this is a company that posts income of 20B a year.  It's a no brainer, right?  $1 For the ability to put in your pocket 20B a year?  
But, what if the price is $10 For the company?  It is still a good deal.  Now, what if it is $20 for 1 share out of 10 million?  Ah, now we see how the market really works, and why everyone with an ounce of financial sense buys stock like buffet does.  The fast and logical conclusion for all investors is to buy profitable companies with low p/e ratios.
But, buffet has also bought currencies before.  For exa.ple, in recent history, he exchanged USD for Brazil real.  What drives that sort of decision?  He stated the following:
"The problem, Buffett says, is that "Americans like buying products made elsewhere more than the rest of the world likes buying products made in the U.S." As a result, he adds, the United States ends up shipping some $2 billion in assets and repayment promises to overseas trading partners every day. Over time, sending out all these IOUs puts pressure on the dollar.
As a result, the dollar lost half its value against the real between 2002 and the end of 2007"
America going into debt hasn't changed.  People moving to accept and keep crypto keeps growing.  It wouldn't surprise me if buffet declares in the future he has purchased some bitcoin.

Bitcoin won't replace the dollar any more than BCH will replace Bitcoin
It will, however, become a serious competitor.  Within 10 years, the Bitcoin network will hold enough value to rank it among the top 10 banks in terms of total assets held.  
All of the top 10 banks hold $2T or more in value, with the larger banks having in excess of $4T.  With the way countries like Argentina are hyper inflating their currency, the Turkish Lira losing nearly 30% it's value over the past year, the way Greece confiscated all money from bank accounts in excess of 100k during the financial crisis, the way China has tight currency control measures, the way the US has massive amounts of debt, and in general, the way fiat is designed to lose value over time... it's inevitable that more people will turn to Crypto (with an emphasis on Bitcoin) until the market cap reaches a competitive level to fiat.  
To me, it's like looking at a bridge that develops more and more cracks over time, and coming to the conclusion that the bridge will eventually fail.  It's not a matter of if, but when, and the when is not very predictable.  Micheal Baum did this with the housing market in 2007.  Buffet does this all the time with stock.  It's just intuitive that investors will place their money where it will best be protected, and by no means can fiat even begin to offer that protection over a long period of time.  Crypto is volatile, but the design is solid.  The volitility will eventually settle itself out.  But, by the time it does, it will be too late to get in at a good price.  Buy, hold, and thank your past self in 10 years.

Basically, you must do a backup to get your word seed.  From there, you can set a PIN from settings.
**NOTE TO DEVELOPERS:**
Just my $.02, but I'd like to see 2 things:
1 - There are currently 4 little menu bars that scroll left to right.  Accounts | Balance | Transactions | Address Book
Can we change this to Accounts | Balance | Tx | Contacts and Fit all 4 bars on the screen?  Or, alternately, come up with Symbols for these items?  It plays with my mind a little bit to see a menu option off screen.  I mean, it's a menu, you should be able to see all your options.
2 - When you 'create new', can you add a Tab (menu option) called SETUP!  This should contain a tutorial that gives you quick access to backing up your word seed and setting your PIN.  I have watched 3 people now try to set up wallets, and from my experience, it has been VERY frustrating.  The process should be:  Download -&gt; Install -&gt; Backup -&gt; Pin -&gt; Receive Bitcoin.  Once you've performed a backup and set the pin, the Tutorial Tab can disappear.

I am not opposed to helping the poor, rather I am a big advocate for charity.  I oppose the idea that there is any sort of human right to free healthcare.  
Suppose I am a physician. If you believe in a right to free health care, then you believe you have the right to come to my house and demand I supply you with services.  It means you believe in slavery. You are going to enslave not only me but the janitor at my hospital, my assistants, the nurses, the men and women who manufacture the prescription drugs required for your care, etc.  You believe it is your human right that we provide you with these services free of compensation.  That is slavery, and I can not support it even under the name of universal healthcare.

Here is how the math works.
pick two prime numbers, a and b.  for this example, we say:
a = 3
b = 11
now do:
m = a * b = 3*11 = 33
n = (a-1) * (b-1) = 20
now, pick a k such that k is less than 20 (n), is prime, and is not co prime to 20.
possible choices would be 3, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19.  5 is invalid as it is co-prime to 20.  for this example, lets choose
k =3 
now, compute j by saying mod(3*j, 20) = 1.  we can solve this and say 
j = 7
j = 7 and k = 3 are now our public/private key pairs.  in reality, we use much bigger numbers to make things more difficult to back track
now, we can say
mod(x^3, 33)  = y
mod(y^7, 33) = x
these two formulas allow you to first encrypt (with the private key) then unencrypt (with the public key) the transaction message.  From this, I can prove ownership of a private key without revealing it.  It is impossible to 'back solve' this equation without first knowing a and b, which are never revealed.  their product (a*b) is revealed, but it is very difficult to perform prime factoring on large numbers with our current knowledge of mathematics

Right, but Electrum isn't web based.  All the site does is allow you to import multiple public addresses, and it provides a summary of account balances against those addresses.

I had the old version, but no coins in the wallet.  I had installed it hoping I could import a private key from a hot wallet.  I was not able to do so.
Now that we have HD, my thought was, I could uninstall the old wallet, wipe all data (no coins, no worries), and if I chose to 'create new', it would give me a word seed I could use as backup.
I did not receive such a seed.  If I go to accounts, and press the key+ button to generate an HD account, it says I can only have 1 unused HD account.
So, my question is, how do I gain access to the word seed?  How do I set up password protection?

The odds of winning the jackpot on the powerball lotto is 1 in 175,223,510.

You don't mine.  It is so competitive now, if you're asking this question, stay out of the game.
You can buy Bitcoin from several outlets.  Localbitcoins, coinbase, LibertyX, and a few others.
You "keep" bitcoin on an account ID called a public address.  You can generate these account ID's in a variety of ways.  There are wallet softwares.  There is brainwallet.org.  There is bitaddress.org.  Lots of options.  There is a catch though.  Each pubic address has an associate private key.  You must, at all cost, keep hold of this private key and not let anyone else see it.  Giving away your private key is like giving away your money.  You can import your private key into various Bitcoin wallet softwares to then spend your Bitcoin.

I'm late for this, but I still want to add to the answers already given.
Many people hated the idea of large farm equipment such as tractors and combines when they were first made.  The reason they hated the idea was because the machinery, by design, would put many men and women out of a job.  And farm jobs were the most abundant type of jobs in America.  There were protests, but ultimately, farmers adopted the technology.
Looking back, we can see that this was a good thing.  Why?  Because even though people lost their jobs to machinery, it allowed them to take new jobs in fields such as computer engineering and other high-tech fields.  
Bitcoin is a threat to banks.  It could possibly put many banks out of business.  But just as tractors and combines sparked a wave of wealth creation in America, Bitcoin is poise to do the same.

I have met 3 people now via local bitcoins that wanted to buy a fraction of a coin to get into things.  The experience has been interesting.
None of them really knew the system.  One wanted me to send to their blockchain wallet.  She was the easiest customer.  The other 2 didn't really know what an address was, let alone what a wallet was.  
I tried getting one to install Mycelium, but she couldn't figure out why she didn't need a username and password.  The latter 2 also had apple phones, so I wasn't familiar with good wallet software for them.  
My current thought is that you have 2 types when it comes to Bitcoin.  The type that has to know how it works (which can be hard to explain, especially to non-technical folks).  Then there is the type that just needs to know the rules.  While the rules can be easier to explain, this type, unfortunately, doesn't grasp why using the localbitcoins wallet isn't necessarily a good thing.

This is really racist of me, but let me tell you a story I find hilarious.  
I have a coworker that got hit with Cryptowall.  He's a white male, mid 30's, and college educated.  His wedding photos and lots of business files were encrypted by the virus.  It was awful, but he knew I was familiar with Bitcoin, so he came to me for help.  After about 2 hours of explaining Bitcoin, he asks me 'If I'm having a hard time wrapping my head around this thing, how in the world will the average person come to adopt and use this technology?'
So, I told him of my first ever localbitcoin sale.  I had placed an ad to sell a few bitcoins just to get myself familiar with the process of using it and transferring to someone else.  No real profit involved other than experience.  The person who came to buy was a middle aged, larger black woman, who seemed to have no college education.  I could be wrong about the education part, it's just a hunch.  Anyways, we did a cash exchange, and as I was trying to explain to her how we could verify the transaction on blockchain, she stopped me mid sentence, and said 'honey, no need to explain to me what the damn blockchain is, i've got the app on my phone.  I know how to verify a damn transaction'.  
It completely blew me away.  I was so accustom to people not understanding the process that it completely shocked me to hear her speak so confidently about it.  Especially since I had a poor misconception that she would be a difficult customer.  Also, my buddy got his files unencrypted after paying the cryptowall ransom just in case anyone was wondering.  
Moral of the story is, we've made things too complicated.  Bitcoin is an amazing technology that doesn't require a masters in computer technology despite what so many people here may think.

Cyprus had a problem with debt just a few years ago.  They had purchased many Greek bonds and Greece got to the point where they could not honor their bond payment terms because they also had a lot of debt.  So, since the Cyprus government was now out a ton of money, and since Cyprus itself still had ongoing obligations to pension plans and things of that nature, they just decided to take all money from any bank account in Cyprus that had a balance above 10k.  So, if you had 100k savings in a Cyprus bank during that time, you'd suddenly find yourself 90k short.  
America is not immune to such financial shortfalls.  When/If the debt/gdp ratio grows large enough, there will come a giant stock market crash as either hyperinflation kicks in and the dollar is abandoned or the treasury defaults on bond payments.  This is partially why US debt was downgraded in recent years to something other than AAA.

I know I cannot predict news.  The mt. gox collapse, the raid on cyprus bank accounts, all of these things are news events that affect price, and I cannot predict news.  Nobody can.  I can live with that.
Math, on the other hand, I am good at.  Bitcoin saves merchants money.  Bitcoin is a better system than paypal or western union for any sort of international payment.  Bitcoin (if used properly) is more secure than credit card transactions.  Bitcoin has a total market value currently at 8B whereas Bank of America is valued at 200B.  All math points to Bitcoin growing in value.  So, regardless of today's news and today's price swings, I can sit here confident that Bitcoin will grow in value because the Math demands it. Business owners are smart people and they will eventually figure out Bitcoin saves them money.  Overstock and Tigerdirect have already learned this lesson. And as adoption grows, supply and demand says that the value will grow.  I don't know when, but over many years, I'm much better off having my savings in Bitcoin than in a currency that is designed to lose it's value.

A nice insight from the article for those that don't have time to read..
BCH, in some sense, is now a liability to bitmain.  They have so much of it, and interest is so low, they cannot pull their hashing power or the network is certain to get 51% attacked.  It would be more profitable to mine btc, but they can't, because they must spend hashing power defending the network they're so invested in.
They are burning through cash to prop up an asset nobody wants.  
If they have sold 2/3rds of their btc holdings for BCH, and the ratio keeps trending back toward .07 (where it started), one of two things happens.  Either there is a massive and sudden flippening due to their fantastic marketing skills (doubtful) or they will exhaust their ability to support BCH at the cost of btc.  When the latter happens, BCH fails, and a great btc bull run will start.

Sending money the traditional way through banks can take up to 2-3 business days.  Bitcoin can be sent to anyone, anywhere, nearly instantly!  And unlike checks, the payments will never bounce!

What do you think the paperwork from Bitpay looks like?  Just 'you got paid $30,000', here you go'?  No.  Rather, Bitpay produces a transaction history that includes a transaction ID, the amount of Bitcoin taken, the fee imposed, and the amount of Fiat obtained.  
It's the same way with banks and credit cards.  Every credit card transaction is directly deposited into Newegg's merchant account.  Newegg doesn't act as the ACH.  Newegg isn't a bank.  Yet, they accept credit cards just like they accept Bitcoin.

This is my understanding, although limited.
Let's say you were sending me 1 of 10 bitcoins you had in your possession.  You create a 'message' which you send to the network to say 'send 1 coin from me to cygnus_x', you sign/encrypt that message, and you provide the public key.  With this, the network makes a modification to the blockchain to verify the spend.  But, what if I were a malicious miner?  What if I kept sending that message again and again to the network until I depleted all your 10 BTC?  How do you stop this?
Bitcoin stops this by putting each coin(s) in a block (is block the correct term?).  When you sign/encrypt your message, you also include in your message which block you are pulling coins out of.  All 'left over' coins in that block then get moved to the new block.  That is why you will always see two 'output' transactions on the blockchain if you have leftover coins in the send address; one to the address you are sending to, one to move all remaining coins to a new block.  This way, if I try to resend the message and it's encrypted counterpart, the network will see that there are no coins left in the block and throw out the transaction.  Trying to modify the block inside the message would make the signature invalid.  Thus, double spending in this fashion becomes impossible.
mtGox relied on the TxID that had not been confirmed in the blockchain.  In all fairness, it may be nice if the TxID was part of the signed message to make it difficult to forge (although, I'm not sure of all the pros and cons here).  However, another quick solution would simply be to record the block where the coins were moved out of.  If the coins are no longer in that block, the transaction went through.  If someone wanted to argue otherwise, it would be easy to look up the receiving address and work backwards from there.

If you've never done it before, you need to go to bitcoinwisdom.com and watch the bids/asks on the right.  I will explain.
The top box to the right are 'ask' prices.  you will see very few people asking.  The bottom box is the 'bid' price.   There are quite a few bids, but for increasingly lower than the last price traded on the market.  Someone keeps hitting the market with a 'market price' sell order, and it completes multiple 'asks' until they are all run off the chart and a new market price is set.  It's quite fascinating.  
Edit: Someone put in a bid order for 98 coins at $730.  It will be interesting if we drop much past this.
@_date: 2014-10-29 13:05:34
At this point, I'm almost afraid to ask, but what exactly is a confirmation?  
From experience, I would say that you get 1 confirmation when your transaction is put into a block.  You get additional confirmations for every blocked mined thereafter.  Is this technically correct?
Also, if someone were to attempt a double spend, does this show up on blockchain.info?  Does anyone have a photo that shows 'disputed' or some other warning that a double spend attempt is in progress?
Edit:  One more.  I have have 0 Bitcoin, and someone sends me Bitcoin but I have 0 confirmations, can I spend this immediately or does the previous confirmation have to be included in a block first?

I don't think it is possible today to mine enough gold to significantly manipulate market price.  Even if you could, just like diamonds, you would want to control the availability to increase demand / price.  For me, this is a good thing, as it means the value of my holdings will increase. 


This is true, but ultimately, the government loses less than everyone else when it prints money. Just look at Zimbabwe's hyperinflation.  Plus, it just makes common sense.  If you take 10 people and give them each a dollar, you'd say they're all equally wealthy.  But now say one of those people represents the government, and they just printed $10 for themselves... now that one individual is as wealthy as the other 9 combined.  If the number of resources being produced by each person stays the same, then who gets screwed the most and who benefits the most?

I don't think r/bitcoin would hate that.  It just depends on the size of the fractional reserve.  There is nothing wrong with loans.   If I loan you 10 BTC, you have 10 BTC, and I have an IOU for 10 BTC.  Loans are a good thing, and this is just how loans work.
Right now, the BTC market cap is ~$8B.  So, to grow 100x in value would be a market cap of $800B, making the value per coin ~$65,000.  Apple is a $500B company, so this isn't tooo far of a stretch.  Bank of America is $200B, and they are by vast majority an American only bank with many competitors.  Would Apple make up half of the entirety of Japan's economy?  These sort of questions get interesting to me.  There is no M1 M2 on gold, and gold has a total world value at around $8T.  There are also very few people world wide holding Bitcoin, which is also interesting to me in the grand scheme of things.

I think deflation makes you think a lot harder about what you're investing in.  Just like the housing crisis, people were investing into assets they couldn't afford simply because they also couldn't afford not to invest.  Leveraging individuals into investing their money through inflation is not always a good thing.
There are pros and cons of both systems.  In the end, I prefer deflation as I do not believe the value of my money should decrease over time.  I also believe deflation hedges against hording valuable resources such as land.  Why hold onto land as a store of value when deflation of currency exists?

I believe you are saying the economy is a zero sum game, which I find to be 100% wrong.
Lets say there is only 1 bitcoin in existence.  How much did it cost to make that 1 bitcoin?  A few hundred dollars?  If someone offers to buy that 1 bitcoin for $1M, and the holder of that 1 bitcoin accepts, the market price of 1 bitcoin is now $1M.  That is literally how the stock exchange and every bitcoin exchange works.  The current market price is the last price an exchange was made at and is why stamp and kraken vary in market price.  It is not a zero sum game, rather, wealth is created independently of dollars.

There are two groups of people that would want to use BTC as a currency *today*.  
First is the guy who has lots of BTC and believes BTC will start losing a lot of value.  If you own 2,000 BTC, and you believe the price tomorrow could become $1, it makes sense to try to unload your BTC savings today.  Maybe you got those 2,000 BTC for $10, and losing that new found wealth is just too intimidating.  Or, maybe they're broke otherwise.  This person has good reason to spend/convert those coins.
Second is the merchant who feels BTC will go up in value over the long term.  For a small pizza company, it may be worth 'giving away' a few pizza's for BTC in the hopes that the value of BTC will go up tomorrow (or long term).  If you feel strongly this will happen, it makes good business sense to accept some payments in the form of BTC.
Now that we have some buyers and some sellers who are both interested in trading in BTC, it just makes sense to hook those two people up to do business.  Time will tell who was wiser.

In QT, you should have a list of receive addresses.  If one of the receive addresses matches this public key, then you can google how to obtain the private key from the QT console.

Why would you use email when the US postal system does everything you want?

There are certainly people who stick with an old, trusted way of doing things their entire life.  If you want to do that, feel free.  But, Bitcoin undeniably has benefits over the other current monetary systems.  Examples include:
Less inflation come 2021  
More secure (if you practice safe storage)  
No bank fees  
No overdraft fees  
No bounced checks  
No government withdrawl of funds (see Cyprus)  
Lower Transaction fees over Credit Cards (possible merchant discounts)  
Faster transactions (banks can take 3+ days to clear a check)  
Better exchange rate (traveling abroad?  Bitcoin may be cheaper than getting local currency)  
If/When you wake up one day and realize this really is a better system, your buy-in rate will no doubt be 10 times as costly as it is today.

Besides being 'noninflationary', Here is why I like it.
I have a property that went underwater in 2009.  I cannot sell it without paying someone to take it, so I rent it.  How do I go about obtaining rent payment?
Traditionally, I go to the property and pick it up and then take it to my bank to deposit it.  But that costs me time and money.  I could have the tenant mail it, but that costs them time and money and it also makes me dependent on the postal service for delivery.  What happens if the postal service loses the check?  And once I get it, how long does it take to 'clear' before I can spend the funds?  Then, what happens if a check bounces?  Guess who pays for a bounced check?  I do!  The bank will charge *me* a nice $25 fee for someone else bouncing a check.  And if I withdrew enough funds after the check cleared and before the check bounced, I get hit with *another* fee called overdraft.  And after all that, I get to go through the whole process all over again to get another check.  
A better solution is Bitcoin.  When I get home, I pull up my wallet and see if any funds have been deposited today.  If they have, then I am secure in my knowledge that I have my money.  At this point, the payment will not bounce, and I can immediately spend it without waiting for it to 'clear' at the bank.  All my troubles above have been resolved through Bitcoin.

Around late 2009/early 2010.  I can't remember where I saw it, but I remember googling it at home and installing the mining software (I think then it was just the QT client).  The software started making my PC sound like metal in a shredder.  I immediately uninstalled thinking I had been tricked into installing some sort of spam email bot.  The system uninstalled rather easily, and it made me stop and think that perhaps I should give it a second chance.  However, I had already started drinking by that point in the evening and said 'fuck it, a non-government currency will never take off anyways'.  I wish I could go back in time and slap myself.
Also, at that time, the price per coin was not even a penny.  Afaik, there were no exchanges.  I didn't realize how the system worked, that only 21 Million units would be printed, there was no blockchain.info (afaik), nothing.

I think I would tackle it in 2 parts.
Part 1 - A replacement for pay-pal, western union and credit cards.  Bitcoin payment terminals allow you to receive payment for goods and services for a flat 1% transaction fee.  This is cheaper than the 3 other listed alternatives.  This makes Bitcoin a hands-down no-brainer in terms of adoption.  Why anyone wouldn't accept Bitcoin after today is ludicrous.  
Part 2 - Bitcoin is also it's own currency which some believe will go up in value because there is a set limit to the number of Bitcoins that will ever be put into circulation.  So, if you would like, you could avoid the 1% fee all together and keep some of your earnings in the form of Bitcoin.  This is a bit risky as it is future speculation, but if the currency goes up in value or if your material providers/vendors also come to accept Bitcoin for payment, it will prove to be very profitable.
And... questions?

Soon, this will be happening everywhere, and people will save up BTC just as they did their fiat currency.  All the while, the Bitcoin deniers will continue to make excuses for why it won't ever work, until one day, it is magically working everywhere.

If you're looking for a bubble to happen again this fall that will make you rich, be prepared to be sorely disappointed.

@_date: 2014-09-23 21:20:42


Ok, here is how banks are suppose to work.  You put your money in the bank, and they give you some small amount of interest to keep it there.  The bank, in turn, makes very smart decisions on where to invest.  This is how they make money and pay their employees.  They lend money to house builders, to business owners, etc, etc.  In other words they make lots and lots of calculated risks.  If they are not attracting enough people who want a loan, they need to lower interest rates on loans.  This is how, for example, you get cheaper student loans.
Then there is what is called fractional reserve.  A bank cannot lend out 100% of all deposits.  Why?  Because eventually, there will be a run on the banks, and they need to have money on hands so that people can have the money they need when they need it.  So, banks only lead out something like 80% of all deposits.  We don't want a repeat of the great depression.  
In your scenario, people (not educated bankers) would be making investment decisions (which would be a catastrophe) and during periods of negative interest rates, no student loans or home mortgage loans would be available as no cash would be found in any of the banks.  
@_date: 2014-02-04 19:15:52


Yes, I am saying this.  If you have a 401k, one day, you will 'cash it out'.  You don't leave 401k's to your family.  They are designed and intended to gain value so you can one day use that value for goods and services.  People cash out of their 401k's all the time despite it being a 'good investment'.  The same is true of BTC holders.  One day, I intend to spend my BTC after it has risen significantly in value.  I do not plan to hold onto it for infinity.


I don't understand why you care so much about encouraging spending.  Saving money is a good thing and leads to deflation of the price of goods and services which in turn makes everyone richer.

Is every purchase made with USD a bet that the value of USD will drop?
@_date: 2014-01-03 22:05:41


Ok, lets play this out.  Let's assume you run a business and you accept BTC due only to the lower transaction cost of BTC over credit cards.  If you are running your business correctly, you will make a profit on this transaction.  Now, you have converted part of your BTC immediately to USD (through bitpay or similar service to pay for expenses in USD as you suggest) and you are left with a choice.  Do you convert the remaining BTC to profit in USD, or leave it as profit in BTC?
I am betting that many companies elect to retain a small portion of profit in BTC as both a hedge against inflation and as a bet that others behave in a similar fashion.  If this happens, the supply of BTC goes down, and the value goes up.  If many business elect to accept Bitcoin (which I believe they will), and if they all behave this way, then the value skyrockets.

Every day, there are 10's of 1000's of exchanges being made on the various BTC exchanges around the world.  This shows that while many people believe the currency will go up in value, just as many believe it is going down in value.  The slight difference in buyers/sellers is what moves a BTC coin value up and down.
So, if this many people out there believe BTC will lose value, why not spend the money on items you need from places like overstock?  This way, you can save the transaction fee of the exchanges.

The nice thing about Bitcoin is in how it differs from failing companies such as Enron.  
When a business declares bankruptcy, the stock goes to &lt; $1 as everyone sells except for the few hold-outs that hope the company gets bought by a larger competitor.  With Bitcoin, the only thing that could happen is that there is a major breach of the protocol.  Without a breach, if the current selloff continues, if we go sub $1...... all of the 10k+ HODLers out there would eventually go crazy buying coins to the point where nobody had any coins left to sell.  And with all the sellers out of the game, it suddenly becomes very expensive to get your hands on a bitcoin.  This is what has caused every other bubble in Bitcoin's history and is most likely what will cause the next great bubble.

Since we're talking core, I had a question about blockchain length.
Lets say that at some point in the future, the blockchain length reached 1TB+ in size.  Maybe even 10TB+.  And, for whatever reason, digital storage capacities did not grow as expected and it became very difficult to store the full blockchain.  Would it be possible to create a sort of anchor block that could reduce total size?  I'm imaging a block that basically summarized all previous transactions on the blockchain and could be referenced as an input for future blocks.  We are currently at a height of 317,955.  Let's say we get to 1,000,000 and we decide we need to add an anchor.  This anchor would summarize all previous transactions, and any transaction starting at block 1,000,001 would have to reference the anchor (or blocks after 1M) for inputs.  Is this doable?  It may require some sort of fork, but is this even a good idea?

I think the point that is being argued here is that a) someone on the inside may have maliciously misappropriated the money and b) Bitcoin allows for many people to freely audit the system in search of fraud.  
I'm not an accountant, so I don't know how true this is, but I can believe the Bitcoin system could make it more difficult to maliciously misappropriate money.  The resources to trace where money went are potentially far more powerful and the system is designed to be indefinitely traceable.

From my estimates, the next halving is on track to come around May of 2016, not in August like you think.  
Math I did a few weeks ago to back up this claim:
Scheduled Start 2014 - 11,812,500 - Actual - 12,203,800  
Scheduled Added - 1,312,500 - Expected = (13,170,925 [amount in blockchain as of 8/22] -12,203,800 [amount at beginning of year])/234[number of calendar days to 8/22]*365 [number of days in year]= 1,508,549.68  
Delta of Actual vs. Expected [production for the year] = 196,049  
Delta of Actual vs. Expected [all time at beginning of year] = 391,300  
By the end of this year, we will be a full 587,000 BTC ahead of the controlled supply schedule. New halving starts at 15,750,000 BTC. We will be at 13,712,000 by years end, with roughly ~1.5M coins expected to be mined next year (based on current over production rates this year).

Besides the other posts, AFAIK, another thing investors can do with a swap is borrow Bitcoin, sell it for Fiat, then loan out the Fiat with interests.  
So, say you wanted to borrow 1 BTC at 1% interest and convert that to $1000 USD that you then loan out at 8% interest.  A swap allows you to do this.  As long as BTC doesn't grow by more than 7% in value, everyone sorta comes out on top.  The guy who loaned BTC made money.  The guy who swapped made money.  And the guy who took an 8% interest loan got a fairly good loan rate.

If Bitcoin can be converted to USD for a 1% transaction fee, then it is logical/rational for these companies to accept BTC.
Companies such as Amazon, Ebay, etc, may feel there is much to risk with using BTC.  Overstock and Zynga are uncomfortable (which is a good thing as it drive innovation), so they are looking at BTC's lower transaction fee and seeing opportunity to win back market shares.
There is nothing wrong with this.  It is capitalism in action.  If they accept BTC, and if they are successful, look for Amazon, Steam, etc, to follow in their steps.

How much is BTC up since the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2013?  Will more business accept Bitcoin as payment tomorrow or less?  Are the number of overall unique addresses going up or down?
All the opinions aside of what the price will do, all trends seem to be pointing upwards.  The price, over a long period of time, continues to rise.  More businesses are showing interest and actually converting to accepting BTC.  The fees associated with BTC transactions are lower than with credit cards.  Opinions aside, simple math points to growth, and I will put my faith in math.

Current market cap of BTC is 10B
Twitter's market cap is 37B
Facebook's market cap is 133B
Apple's market cap is 500B
The value of all gold in the world is 8.2T?

According to this:     Overstock did $1B in revenue in 2012.  If they do 1% of transactions in BTC this year (as predicted by the CEO), that's $10 M in BTC revenue.  If they keep half the savings (ie, from credits cards being processed at a lower rate) from this, that's roughly $100k USD in BTC savings (assuming 2% savings over credit card), or 117.6 coins at the current price.  For a company doing $1B in revenue, keeping 110 BTC per year seams like a reasonable strategy.

In the second, people spend 10 Trillion doing nothing but digging holes until there are a lot of fucking holes everywhere.   Now, where would your rather live?

Here are some advantages:
Have you ever had to send money via western union or paypal?  Compare the fees involved with these companies compared to Bitcoin.  Also, neither of these two companies has sent money to the space station.  The Bitcoin protocol has done that.
Have you ever traveled to another country and been charged to convert your currency into local currency?  Then you had to pay again to change it back?  Bitcoin has the potential to forever remove these conversion fees.
Currently, merchants are charged 2%-3% per credit card purchase.  The reason visa, mc and the like can get away with this is because it is 'safer' than dealing with money.  Ie, your employees can't just grab what is in the register and run.  Bitcoin is just as safe (actually, safer) and can be converted into USD for 1%.  This is especially helpful for online retailers.
Have you ever seen a run on the banks?  Do you know what happened in Cyprus?  Do you know that when you put money in a bank that you no longer own that money? Instead, the bank just credits your account and says you are owed it back at some point.  
Do you know that inflation reduces your buying power by ~2.5% per year?  If you owned 1,000,000 in 1970, you have lost 90% of your buying power with that money.  Today, you'd have to own 10,000,000 to be as rich as a 1970's millionaire.  
Has anyone ever written you a check that ended up bouncing?  Who gets charged the fee?  Who is ultimately out of money?
Have you ever been charged money for over-drafting from your account?  Bitcoin can't overdraft.  
Have you ever needed to manage your bank account but found that the bank isn't opened when you have the time?  Bitcoin is always open.
What is amazing to me is that with bitpay and coinbase, there is literally no reason for every merchant across America to not take bitcoin as payment.  There will come a day when we hit critical mass and we'll see a tidal-wave of adoption.  After that, we will see employees being paid in Bitcoin, and the price per coin will start preparing to land on the moon.

The front end definitely needs some work.  In my experiences, these are the most difficult issues I run into:
Myth:  Blockchain.info doesn't show the transaction as pending, so it hasn't come through yet.  
Reality:  This is false.  Blockchain.info doesn't always work and transactions don't always propagate to all nodes.  Dependency on blockchain.info is really too high given it's unreliable performance.  
Myth:  Blockchain.info is the only/best/easiest wallet available.
Reality:  It's still up for debate.  Having coins on a 3rd party website is not good practice.  However, there are still vulnerabilities with using hardware devices, and I don't believe an optimum solution has been created here just yet.  
Myth:  Bitcoin transactions are instant.
Reality:  You cannot spend Bitcoin you receive until the transaction has been placed into a block.  In some instances, blocks can take upwards of 1 hour to be mined.  
Myth:  You must wait for 3 confirmations.
Reality:  Double-spends are theoretically possible but in all actuality, they are quite rare.  At this point, given the current network strength, 0 confirmations are ok for small purchases, and 1 confirmation is good (in my opinion) for any purchase under $10,000 USD.
Myth:  The value of Bitcoins do not change over time.
Reality:  The value of Bitcoin historically has changed greatly over time and varies depending upon which exchange you're referencing.  
Myth:  I don't need a paper backup of my private keys.
Reality:  Hardware fails, and you better have a paper copy of either your word seed or your private keys (this is dependent upon address creation strategy).

No problem.  Despite how it may appear, I am not trolling, but stating my beliefs.  


Fair enough.  But, just as MasterCard has 3 major competitors and MA's market cap is north of $100B, I see no reason Bitcoin can't have 3 competitors and still maintain a marketcap north of $100B.  Add to this that Bitcoin serves as a banking system, and that BOA has a market cap north of $200B, and I think Bitcoin has lots of room to grow.


Bitcoin has no backing, can't be used to pay your taxes, offers no protection or consumer security, and is partially valued based on an arbitrary limit and artificial scarcity not necessarily present in other coins, and certainly not necessary for its function.
Let's take these one at a time.
First, [here is an article of 9 failed popular currencies](  Let's look at some common themes:
**Backing by the federal government, the status as official currency of the USD** - all of these currencies in the article listed were backed by their federal governments, and yet they still failed.  So, federal backing is *not* a sign of currency strength.  It is correlation, not causation.  
**and a general consensus that a $20 bill can buy you approximately $20 worth of goods and services**
I believe one day that there will be a general concensus that 1 mBTC can buy 1 mBTC worth of goods and services.  Doesn't seem like a far stretch.  
**Bitcoin has no backing** - again, not required for success.  I just showed other currencies that had backing and failed.
**can't be used to pay your taxes** - same as above.  All of these failed currencies could be used to pay taxes up until the point of failure.
**and is partially valued based on an arbitrary limit and artificial scarcity not necessarily present in other coins**
In every example listed of the 9 failed currencies, all of them end in wild inflation.  Scarcity is a good thing.  
As for value, I don't understand your arbitrary limit and artificial scarcity logic.  Google, today, trades for 1,205.43 per share.  The number of shares is mostly arbitrary, but there are over 200M of them.  What do you believe set's the value of this stock?  Does the number of other shares from other companies on the stock market have anything to do with it's price?

From my understanding, each block is composed of numerous transactions.  Each of this transactions must be verified.  This process involves 'unencrypting' the signed message using the public key.  A miner must do this for several transactions, add a value called the noonce to it, then take a hash of all those transactions.  The resulting output of the hash is &lt; 0000000FFCCAAB143 or whatever, then it becomes 'valid'.  The nonce is the random number added to the string of transactions such that it changes the hash output.  If you get a value that is too high, you must guess a new nonce and rehash.  
Simultaneously, if a new block or set of transactions hits the network, it is now very easy to determine if it is legitimate.  Just try taking a hash of the string with the nonce value.  If the hash is incorrect, then we throw out the transaction entirely.  If it is correct, then we go into checking all the transactions to see if they are all legit.  If that passes, we add the block to the chain and start working on the next block.  The key here is, with lots of computing power, we can throw out bad transactions easily.  Guessing the correct nonce value is difficult, but verifying the proof of work is easy, especially with large sums of computing power, which then makes the network difficult to attack.
@_date: 2014-03-26 19:57:16


I don't think it works that easily.
Let's say I made my Bitcoin in early 2013 running ads, and those ads are still sitting on my account with the ad company.  They exists as a credit, and I have not withdrawn.  I want to pay taxes on them this year as income despite not having control of them.  I want to do this because making 50 coins at $10 per coin in early 2013 is a hell of a lot different than reporting income on 50 coins at $5000 per coin when/if I withdraw in 3 years.  I have to report this year as income if I want to later claim they are long term capital gains.  
By the same logic, when I receive a direct deposit into my bank account, I don't actually own those funds yet.  The bank owns the funds and they show as a credit on my account.  Yet, I am taxed on those funds as income immediately.  
But, on the days I made these coins, the price swing was wild.  The price ranged from $0.50 to $15.  There is no time stamp, and I have no idea what exchange they came off of.  What do I do?
@_date: 2014-03-26 20:55:03
Yes, Gox transactions may or may not be available for view now.  I haven't looked into it that closely.  Even if they technically are, I still think my scenario is very plausible, which is all I'm trying to convey.   
I still disagree that most people won't guess.  I think people who use Bitcoin that are able to keep flawless records of transactions are few and far between.  
Also, the initial wave of people who are audited may very well be miners from 2010.  Imagine making 15,000 in BTC in 2010 when they were around .001 each.  You didn't report it as income because it's a silly Bitcoin.  Now it's 6 years later, the price is $10,000 per coin, and you're sitting on $150M.  I can about guarantee whoever plays that tax reporting game isn't going to have perfect records.  And Bitcoinwisdom only reports initial values back to 2012.  There will be a lot of guessing/settling between this person and the IRS.

His claim is that it's silly to buy Bitcoin at a $500B market cap when you can buy a new altcoin at a $100M market cap (aka, much smaller market cap) when it does the exact same thing due to no patent *and* since there is software available to make your own Bitcoin clone in seconds *and* since it has so much more room for growth.  He thinks if a retailer takes bitcoin, they'll also take dogecoin, etc, and just convert to fiat.  I don't agree with him, but that's the argument.  With the longtail striking out against competitors, this undermines his claim even further.

If you're in US dollars, your cash holdings have lost 2% of their value this year.  
Over 10 years, that's a combined lose of roughly 24%
The theory is, Bitcoin won't lose value over time like this as inflation of the monetary supply after 2017 will be less than USD inflation and will continue to decrease.  
So, if you had to hold cash in one system or the other, which one would you choose?

True, it is not much different from fiat.  But, with a case such as the Mt.

I do.  And I use online bill pay quite a bit.  However, when I have sent checks in the past, they never go directly to banks.  My HOA payments, for example, goes to an HOA service company and then it gets deposited into the bank.  When I send off payments for my garbage collection service, again, it doesn't go to a bank, but to the collection company's main office.  When then company I work for receives checks, they never go directly to the bank, rather we have an accounting department that makes deposits as we receive checks.  The only time I have ever seen direct deposit is through a payroll service for paychecks.  Also, here is my banks statement on the issue:   Specifically, "Income received from your employer, Social Security, pension and retirement plans, the Armed Forces, VA Benefits, and annuity or dividend payments may all qualify for Direct Deposit."  No where does it state that all types of payments qualify for direct deposit, nor does it suggest receiving payments from customers in the form of direct deposit.  I could be wrong.  Maybe I'm just not familiar enough with how my bank works.  You are the first to ever suggest that a Tenant could direct deposit into my bank.

Every credit card service has some sort of merchant service provider.  These people come in, sell you a point of sales system that accepts credit cards, and they make a profit off of all credit card purchases made in your store.  Visa, Mastercard, Amex, etc, take the rest.
Bitpay and Coinbase both seem to have merchant solutions but no affiliate program.  IMHO, they should have a Point of Sale system that can be set up by a merchant service provider such that the provider gets a cut of all Bitcoin sales.  Within a few months, they'd have 1000's of people around the world going merchant to merchant to sell their Point of Sale system.  Also, to clarify, this should be an add to the existing system, not a replacement.

This may be good in the short term for pricing.  Accelerating mining speeds have put us ahead of controlled production.

I'll save everyone the time:  
Software developers and individuals using bitcoins will not be required to get a license, Lawsky said. Nor will companies managing customer rewards programs or gift cards, he added.
“Additionally, we are making clear that merchants who accept virtual currencies as payment for goods and services — and their customers — will not be required to obtain a BitLicense, if that is the only virtual currency activity in which they engage,” Lawsky explained.
These are both good steps, but no significant news imo.

[Forbes stated that 67 million were sold in 2012](  
That is in one year, and the number was expected to hit 87 million in 2014.  In 10 years time, that is 1 tv per every 7 people on the planet.  People own fucking tvs.  
So, if you can save up enough to afford a TV, and you're buying a bitcoin, then we've established that it is reasonable to assume people can buy .5 btc.  That isn't far from my original comment that 8 milion adopters could afford 1 whole BTC.

It's always good to talk security.  
-Always generate private keys on a freshly installed OS (or dedicated hardware device) that is *disconnected* from the internet  
-Always keep paper copies of the private keys  
-Always keep a well encrypted copy with a 3rd party  
-Always password protect your wallet  
-Never post your private key to any website  
-Never store unencrypted private keys (this includes paper copies)
-Never type private keys into a computer that is not yours or has been excessively exposed to the internet

No.  Cryptowall encrypts all your files and demands a ransom in Bitcoin.  If you pay, it unlocks the files.  If you don't pay, it ups the ransom.  It threatens that if you wait too long, it will never give you your files back.  
So, if you have lots of important data on your PC (wedding photos, project files, business stuff, etc), you will find a way to obtain Bitcoin to pay the ransom.  Coinbase is perhaps one of the better methods currently for obtaining Bitcoin.

Sure.  The read below is a bit lengthy, but it's really quite simple.  The key aspects are:  1) Generate keys from a fresh install of Ubuntu 2) keep paper copies
Tutorial:    
Install Ubuntu on a USB drive or cheap SSD drive.  It's fairly easy to do.  I even made step by step directions for it here:  
I recommend going ahead and spending the extra few dollars for an SSD drive.  I have found in my practices that the USB drives are slow and tend to corrupt easily.  
Next, generate your private keys on your freshly running version of Ubuntu via your favorite method (this could be a whole other thread in itself).  You'll probably want at least 2 private keys.  My favorite method is still bitaddress.org, but Mycelium's BIP32/39/44 key generator as well as utilizing the word seed from Electrum are both interesting options.   
Now, print/write down a copy of the private keys as they are your life.  This cannot be stressed enough.  I cannot tell you how many times I have had to recover from paper copies.  So, make a paper copy.  Also, I personally have an encryption scheme for my paper copies just in case someone finds a way of stealing them.  Nothing fancy, just enough changes to prevent an immediate sweep.  
Remove all keys from your wallet software and test importing the private keys just to ensure they work.  
Now your set.  From here, I have my public address on watchonlywallet.com  That way, if at any time I want to accept money, I can access my public addresses from any device with a web connection.  For the Ubuntu install, you can remove it from your computer completely when not in use.  To use, power down, disconnect your other drives, plug it in, then boot.  Keep the wallet software on it so you can quickly move coins, but keep it disconnected otherwise.  Use one of the keys as a hot wallet address, the other for cold storage.  For your hot wallet, simply import your hot wallet public key to the wallet you're using.

Right now, unless you are getting a discount when you pay in bitcoin, it is better to use your credit card.  In fact, unless you are an early miner and have 1000's of Bitcoin you'd like to start unloading, there is more market incentive to hold your Bitcoin than to use it for purchases.  For merchants, there are great incentives to accept BTC payments.
The key is, at some point in the future (which is what we care about), there will be good reasons to use Bitcoin as a form of payment.  Imagine if credit card companies started accepting BTC to pay off credit card bills. Imagine if other bills, such as utility or mortgage could be paid with BTC.  If this type of future ever becomes a reality, you will have wished you had purchased BTC before it became so widely adopted.

This can be difficult to wrap your mind around, but imagine this.
A private key makes a public key.  A public key cannot make a private key.  Just take that to be truth.
A private key signs (encrypts) your transactions.  A public key decrypts them.  By sending the network a transaction, a signed transaction and the public key, you prove ownership of the private key.  The private key never hits the network.  This is why private keys can be made offline.  There are so many possible private keys, it is considered impossible for any 2 people to generate the same key.  The private key signs messages before sending them out and is the source of your public key.  This is the major advantage to Bitcoin.  Unlike credit card transactions, where all your data goes into the POS terminal, Bitcoin never shares the private key.

If it's possible for a tenant to online bill pay directly to my bank account, then that's news to me.  I have had tenants online bill pay to my home before, but even then, I still have to go cash a check, which takes time to clear, and can also bounce.  Also, when I have cashed out accounts from services such as Scottrade, I have always received a check to my house, not to my bank.
You are assuming a tenant has to first buy Bitcoin before sending each month.  What if the bulk of my tenants financial assets were in Bitcoin?  What if they had to convert to USD before paying?  What if the price of BTC rose relative to USD after they sold?  What if it takes 5 days for coinbase to convert their BTC to USD?  If rent is in BTC, then how do I, as a landlord, ensure I am getting fair market value if the price relative to USD changes daily?
If you work off the assumption that the Tenant has Bitcoin and doesn't have to convert USD to BTC each month, then accepting payments in BTC makes sense.

$100k is possible, but I highly doubt that it will be this year.  Maybe within 10 years.
What is important is to look at the market cap of Bitcoin.  This is the total USD value of all Bitcoin in circulation.  Currently, it sits at roughly $10 Billion.  By contrast, Facebook has a market cap (ie, the total USD value of all it's shares of stock) of $150B.  Apple has a market cap of $500B.  Gold has a total world value of roughly $8T.  Some people have estimated that total world currency value is $51T, but I'm not sure I believe that number.  So, if you believe Bitcoin will achieve Gold Market cap parity (ie, $8T), then that requires the price per BTC to be $800,000 per coin.  At a minimum, I believe it will reach the value of Facebook within 5 years, which means we're looking at a 15x increase in value.

The key to success is to have a high level of confidence that your private keys are not compromised.  Here is what I recommend if you have enough BTC to need cold storage.  
[Spend $18 on an SSD drive](
Shut down your computer.  Unplug all other drives.  Plug in this new SSD.  Install your favorite OS to it (if windows 7, you will need to disable hybernation to ensure you have enough disk space).  
Now, you have a clean copy of an OS to start the fun. Download firefox and the no-script add-on.  
Now, choose an option:
Option 1 - Go to BitAddress.org and generate/print Private keys.  No matter what option you take, I highly recommend writing down/printing your keys.  You will lose the electronic copies and you will want your paper backups.  You can import these keys into any wallet as needed to spend.  You can store the public keys on a site such as watchonlywallet.com to reference their account balance.
Option 2 - Download Electrum and use their word seed for generating addresses.  In this case, you will want to write down/print the word seed.
Option 3 - Buy a Trezor and follow their directions.  
When you are done, store/hide the paper copies.  Power down, remove the new SSD, plug back in the old ones, and you're back to normal.  
Extra:  Pros and Cons of word seeds
Word seeds are great because it allows you to access funds relatively easy.  Instead of going through the trouble of accessing a cold storage drive, you can download your wallet, plug in the word seed, and you're read to start spending.
The bad thing is, it because difficult to manage your funds securely.  If I have 10 cold storage addresses each holding a fixed number of BTC, I can import any 1 private key to a hot wallet without exposing the other funds.  You could possibly do this with word seeds as well, but it just feels sloppy to me.

It is possible Bitcoin will not be adopted.  I just believe every chart and trend I've looked at points toward widening adoption.  All the math is there to support Bitcoin growing big.  It saves merchants money and customers will like holding it as it will deflate in value slower than the USD starting around 2021.  Both sides benefit.

I think you need custom software.
Beyond multi-sig, it would be nice if you had a wallet with pre-approved sending addresses.  That way, you'd have multi-sig as a safeguard against sending payments, and address verification that forces a process of authorizing what addressed are allowed to receive funds.
This may even require custom hardware.  We are in some exciting times.

Counterfeiting a US dollar would be to create something that looked and felt just like a US dollar.  To do this inside the Bitcoin network is considered 'mining', and is a legitimate form of work.  To produce a Bitcoin, you must lend your computer power to the network to verify transactions.  Trying to counterfeit this process would simply make the network stronger, not weaker.

What I find interesting about the LTCM story is that they started off successful.  After their fall, the were able to use their same mathematical approach to pay back their debtors.  What sunk them, ironically, was the failure of foreign governments.  To quote wikipedia:
"Such losses were accentuated through the 1998 Russian financial crisis in August and September 1998, when the Russian Government defaulted on their government bonds."
Bitcoin is indeed very similar.  The math behind it is brilliant.  But, it could very well be the fuck up of governments through crippling regulation that causes it to come to a crashing end.  I am hoping, praying, betting, gambling or whatever you want to call it, that this doesn't happen.

This isn't exactly 'super clever', but I feel it is a solid solution.
I installed Ubuntu onto a USB drive.  I then unplugged my C: and booted from USB.  I then installed electrum and visited bitaddress.org.  Then I unplugged my internet connection, generated a private key on bitaddress.org and imported it into electrum to ensure the corresponding public keys matched.  I then moved the bulk of my funds to that public key.  I then printed the private key, but changed various characters in the private key in case anyone ever found it.  For reference, if you change just 5 digits on a private key, it results in well over a trillion different possible combinations of changes.  On that same sheet of paper, I left myself instructions on how to unencrypt that key in a way only I would know how to use.  So now I have an encrypted paper wallet and a keylogger resistant electronic wallet.  
If anyone is interested on how to installed Ubuntu on USB, I am considering writing a tutorial.

No, but I can guarantee with 95%+ certainty that the % increase in Bitcoin circulation will be less starting in 2017 than the USD.  
The Federal government literally prints billions of dollars every month.  If you were a millionaire in 1970, you'd have to have 10 million today just to maintain the equivalent buying power.  And the reason is by design.  The government prints money as we are no longer on a gold standard.
Governments can kill Bitcoin.  No doubt.  But, if governments are not malicious toward Bitcoin and let it grow, it will continue to gain value relative to USD.

Here are the pro's of bitcoin:
Transaction fees for merchants currently run around 1%.  Compare this to 2%-3% for a credit card transaction.  If you spend $100 at an electronics store, that's an average savings of $1.50 per $100 transaction.  It's a lot of money up for grabs.
Sending money via paypal or western union is expensive.  Bitcoin can be sent for much cheaper and has also gone to the space station.  Western Union and paypal have never sent money to the space station.
Bitcoin is resistant to inflation (or, at least, it will be).  That is good for me as a holder of currency.
You do not have to trust a 3rd party to hold your Bitcoin.  Cyprus, last year, decided it would take everyone's money over 100k in their bank accounts.  Bitcoin is safe against this sort of theft and more secure than just holding onto cash.
Finally, your friend is thinking in terms of today's usage.  In 10 years, when there is very little potential left for the value of Bitcoin to grow, it will be much more widely used as a currency.

Total BS.  The people worried about inflation measure an economy in terms of velocity and all sorts of other metrics.  These metrics aren't necessarily bad, but trying to boost them via printing money is just stupid.  I'm sure I'm preaching to the choir here, but inflation has unfairly shifted the wealth all around the world from wage earners to holders of commodities.  And I do not think it is fair to ask society to depend on their ability to invest successfully as a means of merely keeping their wealth in tact when most people can't even balance a checkbook properly.

Negative.  
This is a unique part to Bitcoin which makes it difficult to understand because it's different than anything you're use to.  I can show you the specifics of the math if needed, but just trust me on this for now.
Let's say I want to send you Bitcoin.  I need to send 4 things to the Bitcoin network to 'move' money.  I need to send:
* The 'From' Address
* The 'To' Address
* The 'Amount'
* All of this data again, but encrypted by the Private Key
Your Private Key never touches the network.  Only the data which is encrypted by the Private Key touches the network.  Your Public Address is then used to decrypt the encrypted data, and if it matches, it proves you own the Private Key.
The Public and Private Keys are mathematically related.  The Private Key makes the Public Key, but you can't go backwards.  If you think you can, then try the RSA Factoring Challenge:    If you can break RSA-2048, there is $200,000 waiting for you.

I'm not sure how other wallets work, but I believe with Electrum, your private keys are encrypted until the point of transaction.  After you've enter the send-to address and amount, there is a pop-up asking you for your password.  You enter it, press ok, and the system goes into trying to decrypt your key and use it to sign a transaction.  If it fails, it assumes a bad password and alerts you.  If it works, your private key was only decrypted for the instant needed to sign the transaction.  Thus, private keys should be kept secure so long as the wallet is password protected.
If my understanding of this is wrong, someone please correct me.

I think part of our difference is that you are focused on the here and now whereas I'm looking toward Bitcoin's future.  When BTC first started, it was play money much like dogecoin is today.  I was even gifted a full BTC some time ago because, at the time, it didn't have much value.  The fear in those days was that BTC would never gain popularity, it would never gain merchant acceptance, and thus it would never gain value.  Today, that has all changed.  The next step in the series is that many merchants now accept BTC, even though it is being converted directly into local currency.  Tomorrow, I see another step in the way of people being paid in terms of BTC.  Landlords will rent for BTC, goods and services will be available for BTC, and people will work to be paid in BTC.  This sort of thing is happening now, and it will occur even more abundantly in the future.  This last falling domino will complete the economic cycle, and it will bring the value of BTC to it's apex.  Once this happens, it will open opportunities for long term investors to start using it as intended.  When we get into that part of the series with BTC growth, the problems you are referring to will have disappeared much like the previous fear of merchant acceptance and fear of never gaining popularity have disappeared.  Prior to 1971, [we had very little inflation of the consumer price index](  We had a working economy prior to 1971, so there is historical evidence that a non-inflationary economy can sustain itself.  It won't prevent market crashes.  It won't fix all our financial problems.  But I truly believe we can start to see a return of the middle class if BTC becomes widely accepted.

Many people are holding BTC today because they feel there is a 10x or even 100x potential for growth in value.  That will one day change, and both spending and adoption will greatly increase.
Also, people are spending.  Tiger direct and overstock posted some great numbers on their BTC transactions.  People are willing to spend their BTC, *especially* if they are an early adopter and holding large amounts of BTC.  Just look at the guys who purchases cars with BTC.  Imagine, for example, that you had 100,000 Bitcoin.  Would you continue to sit on it, or would the thought of having a big mansion, a fast car, and exotic trips around the world tomorrow lure you into spending what you have?  We don't live forever.  There is a certain point where desire for stuff outweighs the desire to invest for future profits.

Let's say you're downloading a movie.  Your torrent software is trying to calculate how long it will take to download.  You start at 1 kbps, then go to 2 kps, then go to 4 kps, then 8 kps, 16 kps, etc, etc.  Your speed is doubling every interval, and will continue to do so for a long long time.  
How does this affect the time to download calculation?  If you are *only* looking at the proportional component (which the Bitcoin protocol does), the formula says 'ok, we started at 1 kbps, now we're at 2 kbps, obviously we're averaging 1.5 kbps!'
But, that logic is invalid, because we're still accelerating our download speed.  The reality is, we're now at 3 kbps, and will continue to grow.  Our estimate is now off by a factor of 2.  Because of the way the download rate calculation is programmed, it will always show a longer time than actual, until you either stop accelerating or slow down.  This also explains why estimated download times always start at several weeks, then slowly reduce until the prediction shows just a few minutes/seconds.  
This is known as proportional control.  It only looks at past data to make a future prediction and does not take into consideration future trends or how long it has been under/over estimating it's predictions.  A good PID loop will look at proportional, integral and derivative components, but that gets out of the ELI5.  
Bitcoin works in a similar fashion, which is why we saw a long stretch of average reward times at 7 minute intervals in lieu of the designed 10 minute intervals.  The protocol looked at the average hash rate of the past X days, and adjusted difficulty based on that data.  However, the current hash rate far exceeded the past X days average because it was accelerating in growth, and thus block rewards were happening much quicker than 1 per 10 minutes.  
If we decelerate hash speed, the opposite will occur.  Block rewards will slow to one per 12+ minutes (which is why sometimes a movie will say it will only take 2 minutes to download, then jump up to 3 minutes) OR, if hash rate remains even, we'll see reward rates hitting the 10 minute mark as it was designed to do.  
*If* miners are liquidating all their BTC to pay for energy consumption and hardware expenses, then drops or flatlines in the difficulty adjustment will slow their ability to liquidate.

sha1() is a function.  if you're an electrical engineer, you should have an understanding of basic computer functions.
sha1() basically scrambles text.  it takes in 'aninput' and spits out something that looks like 'Ab18Gdz92'.  Because of how the function is designed, small changes to the input wildly change the output.  And because of the size of the output, there is a very small chance of 2 different inputs having the same output. 
Miners hash the input transaction strings (adding a value to it called a nonce such that the output changes) until they get an output with several leading 0's.  The number of leading 0's in the output signify the difficulty.  Miners perform this operation because it makes it computationally expensive to make a change to the blockchain.  Because 'the longest chain' is chosen as the 'true' chain by the network, if I were to go back and try to change a transaction in a previous block, I would also have to redo all subsequent hashes of every transaction block.  If I fail to recreate the hashes, the network will instantly invalidate my chain.  It is very computationally expensive to re-do these hashes, and as I am working to make the change, the network of miners is constantly adding blocks to the 'true' chain, which 'moves the goalpost' if you will.  It is a novel concept and not one I am familiar with in any other application.

Here is my side-by-side comparison of fiat to crypto
Number of fiat currencies that have died due to hyperinflation: dozens.  Number of crypto that have done the same?  0
Annual fiat inflation 2%.  Bitcoin inflation in about 7 years; &lt; 2%
How easy is it for the government to seize my fiat on a whim?  Very easy.  Crypto; very difficult
Ease of transporting fiat; medium difficulty.  You can't take &gt; 10,00 USD on a plane without tons of questions and possible seizure.  Crypto goes right through.
Security risk of internet payments with credit cards; high, thus the 3.5% fees.  Crypto; low, thus the .002 btc suggested fee
Speed of transactions for fiat via bank check; slow.  Crypto; near instant.  
Problems with counterfeiting; fiat medium, crypto none
I could probably keep going, but as a system, crypto has many superior intrinsic traits to fiat.  Yet, current market value of fiat is many orders of magnitude higher than crypto.

This is the most agreeable position we seem to have.  The only reason I would back the idea of getting us back on the gold standard would be to prevent an increase in money supply like we see year after year.  If the federal reserve would simply say 'there will be $1T in USD in circulation, no more, no less, forever and always', I would back this plan as well. In fact, it may even be slightly more favorable as it doesn't carry as many risks as having a shortage of gold.

I, for one, would favor laws concerning Bitcoin.  Not laws that ban it, but rules that legitimize it's use.  Allowing for exchanges and establishing a framework for which exchanges must operate I feel would be beneficial.


Another smaller exchange got hacked.  Other than that, nothing major.


That every merchant that doesn't sign up for Bitpay or Coinbase POS systems tomorrow is missing an opportunity to save over 1% per transaction.  I feel if merchants understood this, adoption would hasten.

So let's review how the price of Bitcoin works.  To make it easy, we'll compare it to houses.  FYI, this also applies to stocks.
Let say I want to sell my house.  How much is it worth?  Well, we start with an appraisal, but appraisals don't mean crap if I can't find a buyer.  So, what I do is I list my house and I wait.  
A few things can happen at this point. If I'm lucky, I will get several phone calls the first week asking to buy my house.  I can then let the people who want to buy argue it out until I get the best deal which usually means the highest price.  This makes my home 'more valuable'.
If I'm not lucky, nobody will make a bid for several months.  This leaves me in a dilemma.  Most likely, I will have to lower my asking price to attract a buyer.  This makes my home 'less valuable'.
Bitcoin prices work the same way, but bitcoins are considered fungible.  That is, 1 Bitcoin is, for all intents and purposes, identical to the next.  So, what happens is, we have 1000's of people bidding on Bitcoins (aka, saying they'll buy 50 at $445) and 1000's of people with listings (aka, people saying they'll sell at $450).  If someone places a large 'market' buy order, then everyone who has a listing at $450 may get swept out of the market.  Only people who have listings at $455 are left.  The 'value' of Bitcoin has now gone up.  People who want to buy will have to offer more money in order to obtain a Bitcoin.  It also works in reverse when everyone is trying to sell and nobody wants to buy.

I agree, Bitcoin can be confusing and all of us were noobs at one point.  No worries.
Private keys are the equivalent of passwords.  Wallets are just a fancy way of storing those passwords and communicating with the network on how to spend your Bitcoin.  Since the private keys are so big, and since accidents like yours can happen, it is always recommended to write down your private keys.

1)  Why not keep a small % of the transaction in profit?  If you mark up items 10%, keep 2% in BTC?
2)  AFAIK, bitpay confirms quickly.  The chances of a double spend are less than getting a credit card charge back.  So, not much to worry about here.
3)  I think so, though I'm not familiar with that specific phone.  Just keep a charger at the store.  
4) No idea.

Not from what I've seen.  I had a fee sheet at one point in time, but basically every card-not-present transaction creates a larger security risk for the bank.  So, fees are higher to offset the inevitable purchase dispute.  Maybe Amazon has a sweeter deal, but for the vast majority of merchants (even very large, high volume ones), I imagine it could save 1-2% on average.  1% is pretty huge when considering many large cap companies only have 8% profit margins.  


Look for "Today the Bitcoin network is restricted to a sustained rate of 7 tps by some artificial limits. These were put in place to stop people from ballooning the size of the block chain before the network and community was ready for it. Once those limits are lifted, the maximum transaction rate will go up significantly."
I am somewhat familiar with the datacenter capabilities of Visa/Mastercard/Amex.  If their server farms can handle a burst of 10,000 transactions per second, I am overwhelming confident the Bitcoin network can match them in performance.
Also, if Amazon started taking Bitcoin tonight, who would have it to spend?  Coinbase is signing up 25k accounts per month.  For me, that is a good measure of rate of adoption.


There is only 1 "If".  If Bitcoin can continue to operate unmolested by the government, then it will be adopted by the masses.  The math demands it.  It is game theory in action, and all hopes, dreams, fears and opinions aside, I will always bet on math.


This is a good thing to focus in on and will probably lead to a frustrating economics argument, but here goes anyway.
When Bitcoin first started, Bitcoins were more scare than they are today.  In the first week of Bitcoin being mined, there were only a few thousand coins produced.  Now there are well over a million, yet the price today is far beyond what it was when it first started.
So this begs the question, why do we have an increase in price when the coins are less scarce?  The answer is, it is all a factor of both availability of bitcoin *and of adoption*.  As adoption has outpaced the growth of Bitcoin, the price has soared.
Second, by your logic, it seems that if I could mass-produce billions of different crypto-currencies, I could kill the value of the US dollar.  If your conclusion is that cyrpto-competitors will hurt Bitcoins value per coin, then I think you have to also conclude that these same crypto-currencies could hurt fiat currencies.  But, something tells me you're not willing to concede that point.  Perhaps a better way to explain it would be; you didn't see everyone in America rushing to take Zimbabwe dollars during its period of hyper inflation even though Zimbabwe dollars were easier to obtain than USD.
Anyways, from my point of view, there is a very big race going on.  A race for a cryptocurrency to be accepted by every merchant everywhere.  Whoever wins this race (and Bitcoin is way out in front), imho, wins the cyrpto war.  Why?  Because merchants currently have incentive to take Bitcoin.  It saves money over credit card transactions.  It could easily replace western union and paypal.  But once merchants accept Bitcoin, why would they go through the trouble of taking doge or some other altcoin?  What added benefit would another coin offer?   I don't see a reason, which leads me to believe that Bitcoin is destine for greatness.

The 3rd party service then has a database crash and all records of transactions are lost.  Now what do I do?  It's tax time, and I have no way of knowing how many BTC I have spent, when I spent them or what their value was at the time they were spent.

I have money in an FSA, which is similar, and seemed smart because the money would be tax free and I could also spend it on things like asprin, bandaids, etc.  Even though it's 'use it or lose it' at the end of the year, I figured I"d give it a try.  It has been a nightmare and I wish I had never started it.  I have about $1800 of funds that are sitting in a frozen FSA account.  Why?  Because when I tried to use it to pay for medical services, the FSA company claimed the doctor didn't file an appropriate explanation of benefits form, and so now I have $1800 in an account I can't touch.  The end of the year is coming, and I've been dealing with the issue since March with no resolution in site.  So, yes, HSA/FSA, etc, seem like a great idea, but no doubt an HSA account would be quick to freeze my funds and leave me to untangle the red tape for months on end.  No thanks.

However, I can do basic math, and fundamentally, Bitcoin is way under valued long term.  I strongly believe, like many, that we will see wide-spread merchant adoption in the next 5-10 years.  And sometime during that time, the marketcap of Bitcoin will grow to a value greater than that of Mastercard and Visa.  My strategy is, and will remain, Hodl.

Do me a favor and think about what you value and why you value it.  
I value bit coin for several reasons.
1 - I keep it, not a bank
2 - it has the strongest CPU power of all the crypto networks
3 - I can use it like a currency
4 - it is non- inflationatory in nature
5 - it is cheaper to convert to fiat than raking a credit card
6 - it is cheaper for me to use than paying foreign currency exchange fees when I travel
7 - I can send it to others nearly instantly cheaper than western union or PayPal
8 - I believe it will grow in value as adoption increases.
Just think of this.  When you wake up one day and every  merchant uses a service to take bitcoin to convert to fiat, why would you prefer fiat over bitcoin?

What it means is that Newegg does not *retain* any Bitcoin, which is likely to change as more and more merchants accept it as payment.

No doubt there are people who feel burned by the system.  There are gox victims.  There are bubble buyers from the whole gox incident.  There are those who thought they'd get rich quick and are now saying the sky is falling after a whole 10 months. There are people who have been hacked or defrauded or fell victim to their own lack of knowledge.  Perhaps all these people are getting out of this system and creating a slow bleed.  But, they are not leaving due to a flaw in the system, they are being driven out by fear.  
On the other side, there are many who believe in this system independently of it's current market price.  They don't look at market price but evaluation Bitcoin based on it's fundamentals.  There are many out there who value Bitcoin at 10k or higher per coin despite the nearly year long downtrend we've seen.  That is the true beauty of things.  Once we finally bottom out, the block rewards start approaching 0, it will become a game of which core believers can acquire the most BTC.   And when everyone is buying and nobody is selling, we'll see another repeat of 2013 price movements.

Bitcoin is safe.  The difficulty is with other technologies.
If you understand how your private keys can be compromised, it goes a long way toward ensuring your own security.  Common risky behavior includes:
Not writing down private keys on paper.  Technology fails, and if your keys are not written down, you will lose your money.
Poor protection of written private keys.  This is rare, but there is at least one story of a redditor that had his vault stolen that contained all his private keys, and those keys were not encrypted in any way.  
Using web based wallets.  Here, you are not only entrusting a 3rd party to protect your private keys, but your are trusting that there are no bad actors between you and them.  Every time you submit your login credentials, a snooping 3rd party can possibly sniff those out, log into your account, and move your funds.  
Keeping your wallet on a highly active machine.  It is not uncommon for virus to wait in hiding for you to make a Bitcoin transaction via your wallet (or import a private key), and as soon as you do, they're off with your funds.  
So, what can you do?
Eventually, there will be hardware solutions for this.  Until then, you can do the following:  
[Get a 16 GB SSD](
Shut down your PC.
Disconnect all existing hard drives.
Plug in the SSD
Install windows to it.  
Download Electrum
From here, you have a few options.  You can generate paper wallets from bitaddress.org and import them into electrum.  You can write down your word seed and use it forever.  Each has it's own advantages and disadvantages.  Power down, disconnect the drive, and plug back in the other drives when finish.  I personally keep my cold storage on this drive and move all new coins I obtain to it's address.  I then keep a hot wallet with small amounts on various devices, and I reload it from the cold wallet whenever I need to.

But, you say at the beginning of your post that you are deeply skeptical of BitCoin?  If you really believe the value will crash so much, then why not buy as many goods and services now as you can (given you have BTC) knowing that your BTC will be worth less tomorrow?  Why not get on an exchange and short-sell BTC?
The answer is fairly obvious.  You really have no idea what the future holds (nor do any of us).  What is actually happening right now is that many early adopters fear a price crash, and are trying to 'use' their Bitcoin before this happens.  Meanwhile, many merchants believe the price of Bitcoin will go up and are eagerly trying to attract customers to pay in BTC.  You must be on one side of the fence or the other.  Either you believe the price will fall, in which case you should be short selling BTC at every opportunity.  Or, you believe the price of BTC will rise, in which case you should be hording coins.  And if you don't know what to think, at a minimum, BitPay converts BTC transactions 'instantly' to USD for a 1% fee (less than credit cards), which allows you to forego much of the risks.

Next time I try selling the idea of Bitcoin to a merchant, I think I'm going to call it a type of debit card similar to MasterCard and Visa, except it only charges a 1% flat fee to merchants.  Maybe, that way they can begin taking BitPay or Coinbase payments, and grow from there.

One more thing to point out since I read your other comments.  The size of the numbers we're talking about is huge.  Imagine, for example, 1 Trillion Galaxies.  Now imagine that each Galaxy has 1 Trillion Planets.  Now imagine each plant is the size of earth and contains nothing but 1 Terabyte hard drives.  That is the number of hard drives you'd need to store every possible Bitcoin address, and to 'hard crack' this would require you to sift through all those hard drives.  The power requirement is so enormous, you'd be orders of magnitude better off contributing to a Bitcoin mining pool.

So, here is how the price of Bitcoin (and stock) works.
There is a large list of people wanting to sell Bitcoin.  The sell list looks like:
Person 1 - 1 Bitcoin - Ask $700
Person 2 - .2 Bitcoin - Ask $685
Person 3 - .4 Bitcoin - Ask $680
Next, there are people who want to buy bitcoin.  That list looks like:
Person A - .2 Bitcoin - Bid $670
Person B - .9 Bitcoin - Bid $650
Person C - 2 Bitcoin - Bid $600
Now, someone comes along that wants to buy 1.6 Bitcoin at market price.  The next Price of Bitcoin is now $700.  Why?  Because Person 3, person 2 and Person 1 each sell their bitcoin in that order.  The last purchase is for $700, thus, the next price displayed on the exchange is $700.  Any future market buy orders will continue to drive the price higher until someone sells for less than $700.
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:09:44
Here is what sold me on it.  
I had a friend that tried to get me into the credit card processing business.  I know that the cheapest transactions cost a merchant/vendor 1.3%+.  The more expensive transactions, such as those online, can run up to 3.5%.  Services like Bitpay and Coinbase allow a merchant to take BTC and convert it to USD for 1%.  It saves money.  It's quick.  There is *no* reason I can see that every merchant globally shouldn't start taking Bitcoin via a Bitpay or Coinbase service *today*.  And if that happens, and people start taking their paychecks in BTC and vendors/merchants start keeping BTC because their vendors/merchants accept BTC, then we're looking at some expensive coins.
I installed the mining rig in 2010 and it made my machine sound so bad I thought I was sending spam mail.  I uninstalled it, thinking that even if I was 'mining', bitcoin would never ever ever really take off.  Now that I'm seeing all of these business crop up that save people money, I have become a believer.

I think this problem differs slightly from a double spend attack.
Lets say I have an initial transaction of A-&gt;B 20 BTC.
This gives public key B 20 BTC.
Now, public key B says  B-&gt;C 1 BTC.
If I own public key C, what prevents me from spamming B-&gt;C 1 BTC 19 more times until all the funds from B are depleted?  I could still reference the initial A-&gt;B 20 BTC along with all subsequent spends to prove the account still has money.  The only way I can think to prevent this is to insert a time stamp and to disallow 2 messages with the same timestamp from existing on the chain.

I cannot predict future value.  What I can do is look at existing alternate comparables.
The market cap of BTC today is ~$10B USD.  This is, in other words, the total USD value of all Bitcoin in circulation.  By contrast, twitter's stock has a market cap of ~$40B.  Facebook's stock has a market cap of roughly ~$150B.  Apple's stock has a market cap of roughly ~$500B.  The total value of the world's gold is estimated at roughly $8 Trillion.
So, there are your comparables.  Pick the one that you believe Bitcoin will resemble most in 5 years, do a little math, and you have your price per coin.

You only have a better standard once you know the other standard is compromised.  
Sha is fine.  Possibly the best there is.  But should it be broken one day like MD5 was once broken (which was previously thought unbreakable), it would become very important very quickly to change as the secret is now out.  
I would compare it to a vehicle recall.  You may think your vehicle is safe, but if there is suddenly a recall, you better take it back now.
Also, Bitcoin uses both SHA and RIPEMD for this very reason.  It is very unlikely both functions would ever be compromised at the same time, giving the core team plenty of time to make the change.

Very true.  Regulation can kill.  But this is true of any business.  Soda could be banned or restricted tomorrow because of health risks, and coke stock holders would be screwed.  Same goes for cigarettes.  And I can't predict the news, so I try not to worry too much about the could be's and if's.  
Also, I would disagree that Visa and Amex have huge costs due to regulation.  I would estimate that regulation contributes to .1% per transaction, but that's it.  Here is my reasoning.  
I have 2 friends that work in the credit card processing business, and I've had the opportunity to look at their fee structure. The base fees in this industry are set by Visa, MC, Discover, Amex, etc, and whatever you can mark up beyond that is what you take in (except for with Amex which has set fees for everything).  Debit cards (since they use a PIN and are more secure) have the lowest fee of roughly 1% + .10.  Credit card swipes, in store, usually run around 1.5% + 20.  However, card not present transactions (such as purchases made online) can run up to 3.5% + .23.  The obvious reason for the fee increase is due to security.  Charge backs, fraud and other problems lead to higher costs for the card issuer.  The more anonymity there is in the purchase, the higher the chance of fraud.  Just think that Target recently had a breach of credit card data that effected millions of users.  The trick with bitcoin, however, is that fraud can't exist.  Bitcoins can be stolen, but since all transactions are taken on good faith, we get to factor that out.  Also, Bitpay still has to abide by financial regulation concerning its ACH deposits, but without the fraud, they can offer BTC to USD exchange rates of less than 1% and still be profitable.  The whole thing is brilliant.

By accepting BTC, you would be doing the same thing, but in reverse.  Your best strategy, for now, is to accept BTC payments, and to keep a small % of the transaction in BTC and then refund all transactions in USD.  After many years, you will have accumulated enough BTC where you could afford to give refunds in BTC and not tie the price to USD.

Most ads work on a per-click basis.  Since you would have an incentive to click the ad, this could only work on a 'per view' basis.  A better solution would be to have a site that pays you to watch ads, but then you'd have people creating bots to give the appearance you're watching an ad.  Advertisers would never go for this.

I'm sure many merchants were resistant to the idea of credit cards when they first came out.  Who wants to take a 2% cut?  I'm sure many merchants drew a line in the sand and vowed never to take credit card payments because someone that had a credit card pissed them off.  The Bitcoin community will repeat the same mistakes.  But, at the end of the day, everyone everywhere now takes a credit card.  The key to it all, imho, is to keep asking. The stages of grief are denial, anger, bargaining, depression, acceptance.  An angry merchant is just stuck at step 2.  They will eventually move on.

It seems like, what we really need is some sort of mega block creation process.  One that, once every ~500,000 blocks, stores every single address that has an unspent balance inside the megablock.  This becomes the new genesis block, and all prior blocks can be thrown out as desired as they are now irrelevant.
The megablock (for purposes of looking of chain size) would have a variable that states how many blocks it is worth.  Thus, the first megablock would count as 500,000 blocks, the next, 1,000,000, etc.  Each new megablock would look at how valuable the current mega block is, and add 500,000 to it or whatever.
This way, you could raise the transaction rate with less fear of all the block chain sizes and UTXO issues.  Virtual all storage issues go away with this process.
Anyone participating as a node or miner could easily receive a new mega block, confirm if it is or is not valid (based on their current stored history) and choose to include or exclude the block.  The mega block HAS to be made/mined every 500,000 blocks.  This would give ample time for miners to sum up the ledger and make the mega block, pass it around, and let miners verify if it's legit or not.  The difficulty here would not have to be very high as there is no fee or mining rewards involved.  
There would be nothing preventing miners and nodes from storing old blocks for historical record purposes, it just makes the process of dealing with big data a little easier as the chain now self prunes every 500,00 blocks.  
The event at every 500,000 blocks would be something like a new years celebration.  It would take place ~once per decade, and everyone in the community would look forward to it.  
I really don't see any downsides with this.  Would miners turn off their rigs and let others create the mega block to conserve energy?  Probably.  But, the miner who creates the mega block can always include a tip address (or something to that affect).  Someone would mine this block, especially if the difficulty were low.

There are 2 keys involved.  A public key and a private key.  These two keys are mathematically related.  The public key can be seen by anyone, the private key must be kept private.
For a good example of how this works, imagine the follow scenario.  You are trying to disarm a bomb and are awaiting for me to tell you the code to disarm it.  Imagine that the code is the number '14'.  The problem is, there are bad guys in the world who are also sending you information in hopes that you will use the wrong code and detonate the bomb.  But, we have a distinct advantage.  You have known me for a long time, and you know I always use a public key of 3 (and the bad guys know this public key as well).  So, how do you verify that you are receiving information from me and not a bad guy?  For this to happen, I'm going to communicate a few values to you.  If I send you the values message = 14 (the code to disarm the bomb), encrypt_msg = 20, z = 33, public = 3, then I can 'prove' that it is me sending you the message.  You can verify this by doing mod(20^3, 33) = 14 OR EQUALLY mod(encrypt_msg^public, z) == msg.  Note the use of the public key of 3, which is how you know it's me.  Notice how I have encrypted the original value of 14 with my private key (which I do with mod(14^private, 33) = 20).  If I was a bad guy, I would not have been able to encrypt the message because I do not own the corresponding private key.  Because I cannot encrypt the message, the decryption won't work, and you would throw out the message as garbage.

I may pick it up then.
Intelligent investor had a home on my night stand for about a year.  I didn't exactly read it every night, but I found it fascinating.  I remember thinking as I read through that the book should be taught in high school.  The story of Red Hat and the great recession particularly stick out in my mind.  Also, for reference, my background is in engineering.  I'm probably not as strong on the financial terms as you are, but math doesn't bother me.  Half my college life was spent doing calculus, diffi-q's and prob-stat.  
Anyways, I can see why buying bitcoin's would be difficult if you're doing a straight value analysis, and I respect that.   But what I see clearly are 2 things.  1) It is cheaper for merchants to accept bitcoin via bitpay than credit cards.  So, game theory states that every merchant will (over time) begin accepting bitcoin.  2) The market cap of bitcoin, in a world where bitcoin is taken as a form of payment everywhere, is *extremely* under valued.  For reference, Visa alone processes 40,000 transactions per second.  Bitcoin only does 80,000 transactions per day (1/40,000 of the volume).  These two factors, in combination with all the data that states year after year bitcoin is growing in value and adoption, leads me to believe this is an investment opportunity of a lifetime.  I can't predict news.  I don't know if the other exchanges will go bankrupt tomorrow.  I don't know if every world government will outlaw bitcoin.  Those events may prove to be catestrophic.  But what I believe is that, short of massive government interference, it will continue to grow.  Just as undervalued stocks attract investors, so does a bitcoin payment system attract merchants as they can save 1%-3% over credit card transactions.  Coinbase is reported to be signing up 20,000 new accounts per day.  There is nothing, other than the current market price, that suggest this train is slowing down.  So, I'm on board.  Big Money or Bust.

Bitcoin gives me many advantages as a citizen.  When enough citizens are able to gain financial advantage, we can say it helps society (aka, a large collection of citizens).
For me specifically, I dislike the idea that my store of value in USD will go down (by design) year after year.  If I owned 1 Million USD in 1970, I may have thought I was set for life.  But today, that 1 Million USD has the equivalent buying power of roughly $100,000 USD.  I feel this is a very sneaky way in which the government steals my money and I just don't like it.

I think we need to ask Bitfinex to send out statements just like a bank would.  It doesn't have to be paper, it can all be electronic.  A simple .pdf sent to your email account detailing your monthly (or quarterly) transactions would be fine.  This way, if such an error happens, you can go back to your statement to double-check to make sure you're not crazy.

Well, lets put opinion and fear aside and look at it mathematically.
Are more people using BTC today than this time a year ago?  
Are more people going to use BTC this time next year?
Have the congressional hearings about BTC so far been favorable, or unfavorable?
Was the adoption of BTC use by Overstock and Tiger-Direct a good thing, or a bad thing?
Are coinbase and Bitpay good services, or bad services?
Will there be more Bitcoin related apps and technology this time next year, or less?
If all the signs point toward BTC growing as a currency/banking system, then, all other opinions aside, math says it will continue to grow and be used.  And I trust math's opinion far more than my own.
Edit:  Also, you are a lawyer, put Bitcoin on trial and tell me what the outcome is.

Have you ever seen an avalanche?  
It doesn't have to be a big avalanche, but any natural event where things just starting falling apart under it's own weight would suffice.  Perhaps stacking blocks one atop the other.
What happens is that Overstock, Tiger Direct and many others take BTC payments, and it all adds snow to the top of the mountain.  Layer by layer, snow is added.  Then, one day, the last bearable snowflake falls, and BOOM.... avalanche.  The same will be true of the price of Bitcoin.  Bit by Bit, support will grow for the currency until one day a horde of buyers comes in.  That is the day we'll see the next big price movement.

US laws state that any gains on capital investment are counted as capital gains.  Bitcoin may fall under the category of foreign currency, but to be safe, it is best to treat it as a capital gain for now.  So, if you buy 1 BTC at $100 and use that 1 BTC to buy $1000 in goods/services, you must report the $900 gain on a Schedule D.

History lets us see remarkable improvements in the way in which communication evolved.  Centuries ago, we relied on horseback to deliver letters.  Today, waiting for information to arrive is intolerable.  Communication is nearly instant through the use of phone, email and text messaging and it is difficult to imagine a world without it.  
History also lets us see remarkable improvements in the way in which currency has evolved.  Centuries ago, we relied on Gold and Silver as stores of value.  But those resources proved ineffective for everyday commerce.  Large sums of Gold and Silver are simply too heavy, even with today's resources, to effectively transport.  So, we have adopted a system of paper money and electronic wires.  Today, I am here to speak of the next evolution.  Today I will speak about Bitcoin.
The technical merits of Bitcoin are best reserved for a classroom setting.  What is important today is to understand how Bitcoin is an improvement over our existing systems.  
Credit Card fee's typically cost merchants anywhere between 1.5% and 3.5% per transaction.  Bitcoin can act as a payment gateway at a cost of 1% or less to the merchant.
International wires take significant amounts of time.  Western Union, for example, has a standard 3 day time frame for delivering money.  Bitcoin can be sent to anyone with an internet connection in less than 30 minutes.  They don't even have to be awake to receive it.  Bitcoin has also been sent to the international space station.  Please call me when Western Union is capable of such delivery.
Have you ever had someone write you a bad check?  Did you have to pay a fee because of someone else's error?  It is not possible to bounce Bitcoin payments.
Have you ever over drafted from your account?  Did you have to pay a fee because of your error?  Overdrafting is not possible with Bitcoin.  
Have you ever lost your wallet or had it stolen?  Did you lose any cash?  Did you have to wait days to receive a new credit card?  If you ever have your Bitcoin wallet stolen, it is not only possible, but very probable that you can still recover your funds.
Money laundering is often cited as a problem with Bitcoin.  But I say, it is easier to launder with cash than it is with Bitcoin!  Every transaction in the history of Bitcoin is kept and will be kept and will always be available to anyone who wishes to see it.  Keeping this record is essential to it's operation.  A clever man can track the movement of any single Bitcoin transaction.  The same cannot be said of cash transactions.
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is a new, highly innovative technology that represents the next evolution of currency.  Please nourish it.  Let it grow.  Embrace it.  Imagine a world where France refused allowing the use of computers, the internet and cell phones and where our economy would be today without those things.  Thank you for your time.

Or, use Ubuntu via these 12 steps:
1 - Buy a 16 GB USB flash drive (aka thumb drive, $10 at most locations)
2 - Download the desktop Ubuntu Iso version 12.04.4 from here:    
   (you will need to choose either the 32 bit or 64 bit version depending on how much memory your machine has.  For most modern comptuers, this will be 64 bit)
3 - Download the linux universal usb installer (UII) from here:  
4 - With the USB flash drive connected to your PC, open the Libux Installer (UUI). Select Ubuntu as the distribution, the .iso file from step (2), and the drive letter of the USB stick and begin the install.  This process will take up to 5 minutes.
5 - Power down your PC, disconnect your hard drive(s), and boot from USB 
    (you may need to press F11 during the next step n order to choose the proper boot device at startup)
6 - Power the PC back on.  You will be given 3 options from Ubuntu.  Select option 2 - install Ubuntu
7 - During the installation wizard, you will encounter an error.  Quit the installation wizard.  Ubuntu should load and run despite the failed install.
8 - Press Alt + Ctrl + T to open the terminal
9 – Type the following commands into the terminal, pressing enter after each command, in order to get access to universe and multiverse content:
sudo add-apt-repository "deb  $(lsb_release -sc) universe"
sudo add-apt-repository "deb  $(lsb_release -sc) main universe restricted multiverse"
sudo apt-get update
10 – Go to electrum.org and  follow the direction for installing electrum on Ubuntu.  The first command line (as of 2/21/14) is; 
sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip 
11 – the second command line (we can skip the Ubuntu 13.10 install directions) is; 
sudo pip install 
12 – finally, start electrum by typing into the terminal; 
The electrum wizard will now open, and you can set up your wallet from there.  Enjoy!

It would violate the rules of the old ruleset, not the new.
Let me see if I can make a visual representation of what I'm trying to say.  I could be wrong in all this, but if so, then I will learn something new today.  Consider:
Chain A looks like this:  2mb-2mb-2mb-20mb  
Chain B looks like this:  2mb-2mb-2mb  
Which is longer?  The answer is chain A, which the new network will use, because the longest chain wins.  Now consider chain B keeps propagating, ignoring the 20 mb block.  Now, suddenly we have:
Chain A looks like this:  2mb-2mb-2mb-20mb  
Chain B looks like this:  2mb-2mb-2mb-2mb-2mb  
Now, which chain will the new network use?  Chain B does not violate the rule set, but it is longer, meaning the 20mb block will be discredited (orphaned).  If the old ruleset, aka chain B, maintains a significant amount of hash power, it can and will overtake chain A in length periodically, which will cause insufferable havoc on the newly created hard fork as blocks are orphaned and transactions essentially reversed.

I read about Bitcoin either late in 2009 or early 2010.  I thought it would be awesome to get a few while they were dirt cheap in hopes they would one day become valuable, although, at the time, I knew nothing about it.  I installed the mining software blissfully unaware of what I was doing.  However, things turned when I actually started running the software.  The sound my PC started to make was cringe worthy.  I thought I had been tricked into setting up a spam mail server.  I figured my computer was sitting there sending out millions of viagra emails an hour, so I promptly uninstalled.  I was scared I had purposefully installed a virus.  Nothing really added up in my mind though as the software uninstalled so easily, but I soon forgot about it as my PC continued to work, and I moved on.
A few months after uninstalling, I read about a pizza being sold for Bitcoin.  I still didn't take the time to learn what Bitcoin was, and based on previous experiences, I just brushed over the news.  In my mind, a digital currency just wasn't feasible and this pizza was just a novelty purchase.  I had read you could generate an account ID while offline, and that was just too bizarre for me to conceive.  The idea, in my mind, was not practical, and would never take flight.
In September of 2012, I still didn't know what Bitcoin was, but I had read just enough over the years to know it was neat.  I was having difficulty with google's adwords, so I started running coinurl ads on my website.  It paid in BTC.  I soon gained my first full coin.  I figured if BTC really did take off, that 1 coin would be worth something.
In 2013, when the price hit $250, I was shocked.  The price escalation was just crazy.  This forced me to read further, and really began to open my mind about what Bitcoin is.
I had considered investing more in early 2013.  I remember distinctly speaking with a friend about investing $5K when the price was below $100.  But, when I read silk road was being shut down and that the owner's BTC funds were seized, it made me nervous.  I couldn't predict how this would effect future pricing, so I continued running ads, but never really bought in.  Also, market cap at that time was 100M, which I just couldn't justify.  
It wasn't until late 2013 when the price spiked again, and I read BTC could be converted into USD for a 1% fee, and I realized that the market cap was only 1/15 the size of facebook that I decided to really put some funds into it.  Looking back, I wish I had read more before reaching any of the conclusions that I had.  Moving forward, I can easily see a 150B market cap within the next few years.

Here are the neat things about Bitcoin's encryption that blew my mind.
* The private key is a very big random number.  It is, by all practical accounts, impossible for 2 people to generate the same private key.  
* The public key is mathematically determined from the private key
* Moving Bitcoin's from your account is done via sending a message to the network
* This message + the private key makes an encrypted message
* The encrypted message + the public key unencrypts the message
* If you give the message, the encrypted message, and the public key to the network, you prove you own the private key and, thus, you can move any funds associated with the public key.  The network never sees your private key.

I don't understand the concern.  It's a storage of public address.  Ie, the address you'd have to give as a merchant to accept payment.

I'm seriously considering making bitcoinmillionthares.com 
It would simply keep a list of all those who have been able to obtain 1 Bitcoin or more.  You would submit your username of choice and your bitcoin address(es).  The site would then verify if there is 1 BTC or more at the address locations.  You must sign a message to prove ownership of the address.  The system would then periodically re-check to see if the address still contained funds and re-rank accordingly.  It would also keep a chart or statistics of how many millionthares existed in the bitcoin space.  It would act as sort of a wealth ranking game, plus the data it provided would be interesting.  
If there is enough interest in this, I will make it.

@_date: 2014-01-29 21:12:34
I didn't like the way mining was explained in the podcast, so I want to throw my own spin on it (the rest of it was beautiful Andreas if you are reading this).
Two of the difficulties with Bitcoin were in finding a way to distribute the currency while also convincing users to contribute processing power to the network.  We need users to contribute processing power because it makes the network resistant to malicious attack, but contributing this power can be expensive.  So, how does Bitcoin go about this?
Bitcoin essentially forms an army just like any other leader throughout history.  The participants in this particular army are called miners.  Miners lend processing power to the network to verify transactions and also fight off spam and other types of attacks on the network.  And just like all the armies before them, each miner is rewarded for their contribution.  The spoils of war if you will.  This reward varies proportionately to how much processing power they contribute.  This is what gives incentive to kids to set up water cooled data centers in their mom's basement.  This is how Bitcoin distributes the currency and how the network defends itself against attack.
Now, many times you will hear that Bitcoin miners solve puzzles.  This sounds confusing, but the reason this is necessary is to prove how much power they are contributing to the network.  If you can solve a difficult puzzle quickly, then it proves you are lending the network a lot of processing power.  It is also important to note here that the test for how much power you are lending the network has a double purpose in that it also serves to verify transactions.  For computer programmers, this puzzle is to add a random number to the input string of a hash function such that the output is less than a certain precalculated value.  There is no way in predicting the hash output, so many random numbers must be chosen until this equation can be satisfied.  Solving this equation is the last step in verifying a transaction and results in a monetary reward.  For those who know math but are not familiar with hash functions, imagine trying to solve the equation 2^x / 3 = any value with a remainder of 1.  We can quickly guess that one answer is x = 2 because 2^2 / 3 = 1, with a remainder of 1.  However, try to solve 2^x / 7 = a value with a remainder of 1 and let me know how long it takes to figure out.  Now try mod(2^x / 47) = 1.  It is very easy to increase the difficulty of solving this equation with very little effort, and the ability to solve large problems simultaneously verifies transactions and proves you are contributing significant computing power.

Given the speed at which they made the transition, it would be nothing for Amazon or Ebay to make the change within 2 months.

This question has been asked many times before. 
I don't have the source, but each block is limited in size.  It has been predicted that in 200 years, even accounting for usage growth, the blockchain will be roughly 200 GB in size.  Compression is a wonderful technology.  Video files are more space consuming than a year of blockchain transaction.
There are already multi-terabit drives on the market.  Certainly over the next 100 years, a single terabit of storage will be nothing remotely large.  Also, with systems such as google fiber, download the blockchain will also be a painless task.

As an example, bitaddress.org will make a paper wallet for you.  You can 'send' the coins from your coinbase wallet to the public key generated at bitaddress.org.  However, you must keep the corresponding private key that bitaddress generates.  If you lose that private key, you lose any funds sent to the public key.  If you ever want to put these back on your PC, you can import the private key and your wallet will then have access to those funds.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:26:44


I believe Mt. Gox allows for this.  Or maybe BitStamp.  Certainly, an exchange exists that allows you to short sell.  


I don't see how you reach this conclusion.  Why doesn't Gold or Silver swing so much?  
I reason that the swings are due to the youthfulness of the currency.  In 50 years, the 'future' of Bitcoin won't be so uncertain.  The idea, by that time, will be played out.  Either it will be considered a valuable commodity, and the price will fluctuate similar to that of Gold, or the use of BTC will be outlawed globally, and the price will have plummeted to near $0.

I think we're mostly in agreement then.  If 90% of the nodes/mining power moved to the new fork, then chain length attacks quickly becomes a non-issue.  It is only when &gt;50% of the hashing power does not move that the new fork can be insufferably harmed to the point where that system simply isn't usable (this applies only to situations in which the hard fork does not implement new rules for validation, which would allow the old protocol to compete with chain length.  Now that I've written this, I'm highly curious if a new fork would implement such a change).  
In a case where 90% of the hashing power does move (aka, a super majority large enough where chain length attacks become irrelevant), then it really comes down to individual services such as exchanges and payment gateway being vital.  If a significant amount of hashing power moves, but LBC, BitFinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Bitpay, Circle, Mycelium, Electrum, etc, etc, still use the old protocol, then the hard fork suddenly becomes stable, but unsupported by major service outlets.

Let me just give you an example of when it's come in useful to me, and we'll let it be.  No need to waste anymore internet.  
I bought a value pack of games during steam's winter sell.  I gave copies to my friends, but I still had copies left over.  I decided to post them to reddit for sale for bitcoin.
I got an offer while at work.  The guy wanted to know my btc address.  This raised an interesting question.  Do I send to a hot wallet on a phone?  It certainly wasn't my preferred method.  Besides, my building doesn't allow my phone to connect to the internet sometimes.  I especially don't want to type in a public address manually.  So, what do I do?  
My solution was to call up a list of addresses I have saved on the website.  I purposefully keep a small number of addresses on hand with few to no coins so that 1) I can access the address from any device with an internet connection and 2) I know the keys for the addresses are well guarded.  So, I select an address I have saved and send it forward.  Since it links to blockchain.info, I could see when his transaction went through, and then I promptly gifted him the game.

So, the top percentage of people hold all the wealth? And you think it's good that the dollar deflates in value because it will cause these wealthy individuals to part with their wealth faster?  
If this is true, then the wage gap wouldn't be [increasing](
[Here]( is a graph of productivity vs. income over the years.  Can you spot where we came off the gold standard?
You really need to ask yourself how the top percentage of individuals gained all this wealth when we have an inflationary currency, which by your predictions, would stop this from happening.  
The obvious answer here is, inflation of the USD only benefits the rich.  When the government prints money, it gives that money back to the wealth elitist that help the politicians get elected.  All of this is happening while the value of our currency is deflated.  It is corporatism, and it's ruining the country.

From my understanding, yes, they are solving math problems both to prove they are contributing power to the network as well as to verify a block.
You will see charts on blockchain.info that show the increasing difficulty.  Difficulty is increased on purpose such that a new block is verified and an incentive rewarded every 10 minutes. But, a second reason difficulty is increased is to give incentive to loan as much power to the network as you can muster because it increases your chance of mining the block and getting the reward.  Now, if some hacker who has rooted the computers of 1000's of grandma's around the world decides to spam the blockchain with false transactions, the horde of miners with high end computing rigs can see that spam, identify it as spam, and throw it out as garbage without suffering a disruption to the network.

Perhaps my understanding of utxo is incorrect.
The way I understood it, each utxo was a reference to the last block containing an unspent output for an address.
If address ABC has a utxo referencing block 1, then (per my understanding), you would find no more blocks after block 1 containing a transaction related to address ABC.  Maintaining an indexed database then provides a faster means of determining address balances as opposed to searching the entire chain every transaction.  
This is easy to see when you spend from an address as block chain.info will show the change being sent back to the same address.  This essentially consolidates all info related to address ABC into a single block.  When btc is sent to an address (as opposed to sent from), I don't see any indication on blockchain.info that this consolidation process occurs, but I've always assumed it exists behind the scenes.
Each consolidation of this nature references the block it came from, so it becomes easy to traverse the blockchain to find a history of transactions on one address.
My thought was, with a mega block, there would be no need to maintain an active database concerning addresses in the mega block.  It almost acts as garbage collection.  When you attempt to send btc, you'd first query the active database, and if nothing can be found, you'd default back to searching the mega block.  This, in my mind, is practical as addresses that have not been used in a long time would not be present in the utxo database.

Thank you for clarifying.  I didn't realize the UTXO database was only storing more recently address transactions.  I figured it was a summary of all active balances, with the blockchain being the fallback to prove why the UTXO database is what it is.  I had considered a scenario in which the UTXO db only stored more recent transactions, but I figured the megablock solution would also reduce overall blockchain length, which I feel will be needed at some point in the distant future as well.  There is nothing good, imo, that can come from the the blockchain hitting 10 TB+ in size.

I'm saying this with only about 10 minutes of thought put into it, but... 
What if instead of using mempool, you looked at how full the last ~50 blocks were (counting only transactions that included a fee. or, giving no-fee transactions some sort of partial count modifier.  As an example, a transaction with fee counts as 1, a transaction without fee counts as .1)?  
This would incentive miners to fill every block, and not use the artificial .75 mb limit.
You could roll out the fee change (ie, increase when full) with the new block size increase, giving an incentive to miners to hard fork.  Fees can only go up with this system.
Unless you controlled 51% of hashing power, spamming the system with transactions would result in a net loss (even with a fee increase, you'd also have to increase your fee for sending, and you'd lose more than you gained).  
Spamming the system with transactions could only be done in shorter intervals.  The longer it is done, the more costly it will become.

What is most likely happening is this.
mtgox got robbed (or so the story says).  they lost of a lot of money.  then, someone had a great idea.
The idea went like this.  Since mtgox doesn't have enough BTC to pay for everyone's withdrawl, they decided to halt withdrawls.  This made the price on their exchange plummet as people feared they didn't have any BTC and the users became more and more willing to accept small amounts of $$ for their Bitcoin.  
Meanwhile, mtgox purchased these cheap bitcoins and sent them to other exchanges (like bitstamp) to be sold at high prices.  Because they were selling so many coins, and because they had ripped them off of their users, they really didn't care what price they sold for.  This caused the other exchange prices to start dropping dramatically.
Now, here we are.  When the price at mtgox and bitstamp are equal, mtgox will stop the charade and 'reopen' their exchange with all bitcoins accounted for.  And nobody can stop them.  In the meantime, we will have a sharp price decline, which nobody could have legitimately expected (except mtgox, who planned it all)

There are many rules concerning the Bitcoin ecosystem.  Hard rules, written in code, that everyone is asked to obey.  Currently, we are operating in a way where a super majority of node hosts and miners have agreed to use a very specific set of rules.  There are many reasons why we currently have a super majority, but that is irrelevant.  The super majority adds great strength and stability to the network and makes it very very difficult for any minority to impose alternate rules.
With a hard fork, someone, somewhere, has proposed a change to the rule set.  The change could, for example, increase the number of Bitcoins in circulation.  It could also change things like the acceptable size of a block.  
Once a hard fork has been put into circulation, it is up to miners and node hosts to decide if they want to use the new rule set.  If the new rule set divides miners and hosts and breaks the super majority, it can become very problematic.  The specific problem comes in the form of unpredictable double spends.  
Lets say only half of the miners and hosts decide to change to the new rule set while the other half stays with the old rule set.  Now lets say the new rule set miners, continuing with their efforts, have created the longest chain by 1 block.  Everything will look normal on your client until the old rule set miners suddenly now host the longer chain.  Then, if you have transactions in a block that is not accepted by the old rule set miners, then those transactions will essentially be reversed.  This, afaik, is what we call an orphaned block.  At a 50/50 power split, orphaned blocks would happen far too frequently for the system to work.  
The only way to break the stalemate is to go back to a super majority on one side or another.  It will most likely happen with time, as one side realizes their position is defeated.  This, in my opinion (I'm sure it will be contested), will require roughly 65-70% of all hosts and miners to choose the same set of rules (aka, 65-70% of the miner processing power).  This would create enough of a super majority, after only a few hours of operation, that the minority could never create blocks fast enough and with enough difficulty to have a longer chain than the majority.

I believe what this is saying is that if you connect to server XYZ, XYZ may start creating it's own version of blockchain and send you that data.  Because if this, you may think you have coins that you really do not.  This may also apply to sending transactions as the server may not broadcast them to other nodes.  This could be use to trick you into giving goods or services without actual payment.
The best/only thing you can do here is to double check your transactions against a site such as blockchain.info or chain.localbitcoins.com to ensure you have what you think you have.

Lets say you type in address 12345678  
Essentially, the protocol does something along the lines of asking:
Does 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 78?
The answer is no.  1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21, so the address is invalid.  A valid address would be 12345621
Bitcoin addresses are longer and contain letters, but each character can be assigned a value.  If you miss a capitalization in one place, the checksum will not match, and the payment will not be processed.  Even though QR scanners and copy/pasting text can be used for 90% of address references, occasionally, you'll have to type one in manually, and there is a good chance of making a typo.  Checksums help prevent that typo from becoming a major problem.

For $10 USD, I purchased a 16 GB USB drive and installed Ubuntu on it.  I disconnected my primary hard drive, booted off the USB stick, and installed my bitcoin wallet.  I then generated an address offline, passphrase protected my wallet offline, and printed the private key (which I modified 5 digits of in a way that only I know), and transferred all my BTC to that new address.  I keep the USB stick and the paper wallet separate.  I am also looking into hiding the paper wallet in a wall in the house.  Since my internet connection was turned off prior to the private key being generated, I see no possible way for a 'hacker' to obtain my private key unless I reboot from USB and connect to the internet.  And even then, the hacker would have had to root Ubuntu with a keylogger/transmitter, and I believe the possibility of that is zero to none.
Credit cards charge merchants charge somewhere in the range of 2.75% to 3.5% per transaction:    Most places charge 1% to convert from BTC to local currency.  So, the next cost is still cheaper with BTC, and will forever be cheaper because there is less risk involved.
Bitcoin-QT wallet will let you know that you have 'unconfirmed' transactions within seconds.  For small purchases, this is completely safe.  For larger purchases, I'd recommend waiting 10 minutes to get several confirmations, which is still plenty fast.  The only vulnerability here is a 51% attack.

I agree that my statement requires a highly liquid market.  I should have listed that as an assumption.  
But, I stand behind my statement that the economy is not a zero sum game.  Wealth is created independently of dollars.  The amount of money that has flowed into Bitcoin does not represent it's current market price.  Rather, the current market price is a reflection of how an average individual values Bitcoin.  As supply dwindles and demand increases (and we have a lot of room for demand to increase), the resulting value will continue to climb.

I disagree.  Everything is valued by part speculation and by part adoption.    Consider the price of twitter's stock.  For 2 quarters now, they have posted losses, yet the market cap for twitter's stock is 5x that of Bitcoin.  Why does twitter have a market cap of $40B?  The easy answer is, number of users.  If I open a twitter clone tomorrow, my company with it's one users won't be valued at 40B *even though I offer the same service*.  


Fiat currency all works the same as well.  But again, you don't see anyone using Euro in America (unless it's at an exchange).  Also, Bitpay doesn't deal in alt-coin.  So, if I'm a merchant offering Bitpay services, then why would I get another app and link my bank account to another service and train all my employees when that coin doesn't offer me anything new?  It would be like trying to convince a merchant to accept Euro over USD when the Euro provides no added utility.   It is trouble to accept a new coin, but it would be worth it if it was an improvement over the existing system.
I'm really curious what you would have to see to believe Bitcoin would hit a 100B market cap.  What metric would do it for you?  100,000 business that accept bitcoin?  50,000,000 unique addresses in use?  What would it take?  Obviously, the market cap of USD is well beyond 100B, but why?

I think the most likely culprit is that you have maleware that affects your phones ability to generate random numbers.  
If someone else experienced a similar problem, and was able to reverse engineer it to find the private key... they could then set up a system to watch the receive address and sweep it the moment coins hit the address.

From my limited understanding... (someone correct me please if my terms are off)
If you own 100 BTC at address 123, there is a block (lets call it abc) in which all 100 BTC are tied to.  If I send 1 BTC from address 123, the remaining 99 coins move to a new block (def).  Instead of recording TxID's, you should record which block the coins came out of.  If there are 0 coins in abc for address 123, then the transaction has gone through.  If someone disputes this, look up the public address and work backwards to see where it received funds from.

I think that depends on if overstock sells all btc for USD or if they keep a % of the btc they take in.
Edit:  I don't know why I'm being downvoted, but I think it only makes sense for Overstock to keep some of their transaction in BTC and not convert everything to USD any more than they'd convert all their Euro transactions to USD.  If Overstock is smart enough to make this move, then they should realize that other online retailers will soon follow.  From there, it is only matter of time before a big retailer starts hording BTC, and then we'll see some real fireworks on price movement.  If Overstock becomes the first major retail BTC horder, then they'll reap the benefits more strongly than the other guys.

So, let's say a hard fork is created.  The hard fork allows the creation of 20 mb block sizes.  It does not make smaller block sizes illegal, it just ups the current cap.
What happens if miners, only totaling 10% of the current network hash power, decide to make the switch?  
Eventually, the 10% will mine a block that is 20 mb in size.  Those on the old network who refuse the change will never acknowledge it, but that is irrelevant for this scenario.  When the miners that make up 90% of the hash power start cranking out blocks (which they will do faster than the new network), that 20 mb block will be orphaned on what you're calling the hard forked network.  Why?  Because there is nothing stopping the longer chain from being submitted to the new network, and the new network will have no reason to invalidate the longer chain because it doesn't break any of the rules.  In addition, the difficulty will be extremely high on the new network, because the most recent chain was forged with hashing power 9 times greater than the new network.  This new network, due to a lack of mining power, essentially becomes unusable.  
That is why I say it is up to miners to make the switch.

What gives anything value?
Seriously, why is the going rate of gold $1,200+ per ounce?  Or, why do some people pay $10k for a 2 carat diamond?  Also, what gives the US dollar or Euro value?
The answer is, when people desire an item, a price for that item can be formed based upon availability and demand.  Bitcoin is a monetary system that is arguably superior to any other system in existence.  It has low inflation.  It can be transmitted nearly instantly.  It is order of magnitudes more secure when your private key is generated properly.  As a result, people over the past 4 years have increasingly been drawn to these traits, and as they attempt to acquire Bitcoin, the price is driven ever higher and higher.

Not every block comes out every 10 minutes.  The block creation rate averages 10 minutes based on difficulty.  It is easy to manipulate the difficulty algorythm to mine many blocks very quickly.  But, doing so and making a longer chain in terms of number of blocks will still fail to successfully attack the network if it doesnt contain the appropriate difficulty.
To be a little more technical, each block has a time stamp.  If you go back a year, your timestamp on the starting block will be a year old.  As you begin making new blocks, you must timestamp them (which can be faked), but your difficulty algorythm is based on those time stamps.  Put too much time inbetween to lower difficulty, and eventually youre stamping blocks in the future which nodes will reject.

I'd love this service, but lack the skill level required to implement it myself.
Ideally, every email sent would include a signature to prove who sent it.  This would make whitelisting easier as emails can be spoofed.  Public keys with a valid signature would require stealing the private key, making whitelisting very effective.
Users could set their own email fee.  If you're really just sending an email to a friend, $0.01 isn't such a large payment, especially when you'll be receiving it back often as people want to contact you.

Here is what convinced me.
How do you *know* you have the right genesis block?  How do you really *know* you have the right client?  
At some point, you have to make a small leap of faith.  You have to have some small level of trust that things just work correctly.
I believe that can be achieve by looking at the difficulty of the past 1-2 years worth of blocks in the system.  No real need to go back a decade.  If you have 2 years of high level difficulty block generation, you're probably on the right chain.  Especially if no other chain has the same amount of difficulty for that time period.  You don't really gain a significant increase in confidence by going back to the genesis block.  This allows signatures to be pruned, which does everyone a favor by removing data.

BCH aspires to be 'the real' bitcoin and see its competing chain fail so thay it can rightfully retain the bitcoin title and all the value that goes with it.  That in itself wouldn't be so terrible, but they did not have the majority of community support nor did they signal prior to forking.  The combination of the two is malicious in nature.  I seem to remember that gavins hard fork would not split unless it had enough miners signaling.  To me, that is the proper way to fork a crypto.  When it couldn't gain enough support, it self destructed.
@_date: 2017-08-30 20:34:37
I'm curious.  Since Segwit signatures are out of the transactions, are costs based on total bytes (signature included), or cost per transaction byte? 
It seems like it would be cost per transaction byte (signature size is irrelevant) as miners are only trying to optimize how many transactions go into a block and are agnostic toward signature size.

I'm not sure I'm knowledgeable enough at the protocol level to give a good answer, but I can ask questions.
How would word seeds work if you use option b?  
For example, lets say I have a 12 word seed I'm going to put into the latest 2019 version of electrum.  Would the BIP recommend that electrum prompt me to verify if this was a standard of segwit word seed, or would it know automatically?
And when I generate a word seed, would I be prompted to define if I wanted it to generate segwit address or standard addresses?  
Knowing automatically seems to be the favorable approach imo with a prompt asking the type at time of word seed creation.  If that is option B, i'm all for it.

I saw an article online through a popular tech site in 2009ish.  I think it was gadget.com? Or slashdot?
All i remember is it discussing the idea the currency was based on cryptography and disproportionatly rewarded early adopters. The article was shit in retrospec, but intriguing, so i downloaded the client.  I ran it, and it made my computer sound like a paper shredder.  I uninstalled, and had my most regretful moment in life as i sat, slightly drunk, and was amazed by how easily it uninstalled.  I could only imagine i had downloaded a kazaa type client that was distributing CP and giving me a fake currency in return.  But, i took it a step further and started to google.  There was no decent resources on bitcoin in those days.  I googled how to buy it, the rate was garbage (less than .01 each), and you had to dwalla money to asia.  Even if i could make it on my computer, id use more in electricity than i could make profit.  Everything started looking scammy, so i bailed.  What person would ever take this currency as payment, right?
A few years later, i read it hit dollar parity, which i poorly assumed was as high as it could get.  Then i heard it went to $10, and i got one by asking for it and was gifted.  As it hit $100, i started to look up the tech, which was far more documented at that point in time.  I looked at the market cap, the controlled supply rate, and it all finally clicked.  From then on, i started buying as hard as i could.

How is cash not a speculative bubble?

I've had some time overnight to think about it.  I'm not sure who the devs on this system are, and I don't want to waste their time, but I've had some thoughts about it.
Each 2 of 2 address should be script encoded with 2 addresses.  The secondary address is for the merchant and each signed tx should say the merchant gets x coins of the address balance.  The primary address is the return address for the buyer, and each signed tx should say the buyer gets total balance - x returned to them.  This way, no matter if the address receives extra on chain funding, the buyer can get it back when the tx is broadcast.
The address is 2 of 2 and the merchant can close at will for cash flow reasons.  This is a bit annoying for the buyer, but not the end of the world.  A good POS gateway will close channels on a decent schedule.  A good wallet may even autoreload for the buyer.  Though, that part is scary.
The last deal is this.  Broadcasting an earlier tx is devastating for the merchant.  What is really needed is two different contracts.  In the first, the buyer signs first and gives to the merchant who then never sees the second signature.  It is an instant spend tx.  In the second contract, the merchant signs first, and is a nlockverify type contract.  Both parties could see this, but will be the only copy the buyer has.  If the buyer broadcasts this contract, funds are tied up for 2 weeks.  This gives the merchant ample time to broadcast their transaction, which would instant spend, which kills the buyers transaction.
The only problem that remains in this for me is the fees.  I don't have my head wrapped around that yet.
Edit:  As an efficiency improvement, at the creation of the first contract, the two parties could agree on another 2of2 address to forward the buyers balance to.  This allows the merchant to cash out while the buyer doesn't have to load a 2of2 again.  The buyer would be given the tx of how to move funds from this future address back to a personal address, and discard that tx if an agreement is made to use yet another 2of2.

And what if BTC overtakes it after that?  And what if BCH overtakes it again?
BCH is a bastard chain with no rights to the Bitcoin title.  They were a minority fork, not a majority fork.  They can claim whatever they want, but it's been 3 weeks, and they don't have more cumulative difficulty since the fork.  It must be considered an alt coin now and forever as it is clear it was not a consensus upgrade to the protocol.  
@_date: 2017-08-20 14:56:30
This space is still very new, and we need to use our community strength to establish a standard when it comes to hard forks.  The big question today and in November is this: When is a hard fork considered an upgrade to the protocol, and when is it considered a bastard chain with no rights to the Bitcoin title?  That, to me, is the heart of this debate.  
With no protocol change, the rule of longest chain wins is the gold standard.  Nobody questions that.  But, it's not so straight forward with a hard fork split.  BCH has existed for 3 weeks now and undeniably has a chain with far less difficulty than BTC.  How many weeks does it take, how many blocks must be mined, before we call BCH what it really is?  A bastardized chain of Bitcoin that is now a full fledged alt coin.
This is not the first nor will be the last Bitcoin hard fork.  It would be very nice to have a standard with how to carry the name forward next time this happens.

I think in all reality, if BCH had just called itself Alpha Coin from day one, nobody would give a shit.  Everyone has their defense mechanisms triggered because it seemed like BCH was trying to steal the Bitcoin brand.  
There are 950+ alt coins, and BCH is now another one on the list.  Had it attracted &gt; 51% hashing power from day one and kept it through now, it would be a different story.  In that situation, I'd say they deserve the Bitcoin name in full.  But, they maliciously hard forked without signaling and took only a small portion of hashing power with them.  Thus, they are a bastard chain of Bitcoin now.  They are illegitimate with no rights to the Bitcoin name.  They are a pump and dump shit coin.  
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:43:27
It seems there was an agreement made to gain Segwit.  Without question, we would not have Segwit without miner buy-in.  On principal, I don't like to back out of agreements.  I wanted Segwit, and if a promise of 2MB blocks is what took to make it happen, I'm ok with that.  
Now, if we forego the 2x upgrade, do miners start mining on the last block before segwit activation?  That would cause havoc, especially if they had 51% of the hashing power and eventually overtook the current chain.
If we forego the 2x upgrade, do miners start blocking Segwit transactions out of spite?  That seems like a horrible thing to happen.
My tolerance for a block size increase is at 2MB.  I cannot produce any scientific proof for why this would be good for the system any more than I can produce scientific proof for why leaving it at 1MB is better.  So, I rely on instinct, and instinct says 2MB is within the realm of reasonableness.  1MB was an arbitrary choice as is 2MB.  8 MB is working just fine for BCH, so no reason it wouldn't act just fine for BTC.
Personally, what I'd like to see is an agreement to postpone the hard fork.  Allow lightening to be implemented and make a decision after observing its effects.  But, if we fork to 2x, I'm ok with that as well.  I do wish I had about 3-4 more weeks though.

My only concern with not going 2x is with lightening.  Should Bitcoin need a 2x upgrade in the future (I don't believe we have enough transactions to where it is needed now), in my mind, doing a future hard fork on a chain with lightening would be much more difficult.  I'd almost rather get it out of the way now than to have to do it later.

Yes it is.  BCH users specifically want BTC miners to switch where their hashing power is pointed.  BCH users specifically want BTC holders to sell their BTC for BCH through a flippening.  BCH users have adopted the Bitcoin name as a way of riding the coat tails of BTC  into greater initial value.  There were tons of ways BCH could have proceeded that were not malicious (see byteball and Stellar), but instead, chose to fork in the most disruptive way possible.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:57:22


That community has it backwards.  As their difficulty lowers (and, if lower difficulty were good, why not turn it to 0?) and mining profitability goes up, it could lead to an inrush of hashing power.  Such an inrush should propel block generate to rates far greater than 10 per minutes.  And miners who obtain BCH will then dump it on the market to cover their costs.  Not a good thing if you're worried about price.  
Meanwhile, BTC blocks may very well slow.  BCH believes this will cause a death spiral, but it won't happen.  The system will balance itself out as it is designed to do until we reach equilibrium.

At that point, what prevents me from spending the funds in my iou to starbucks via another transaction?  When starbucks goes to close that account and record everything on chain, how do they know the money will still be there?
I read somewhere that bounties are how we take care of this.

I'm finding myself slightly less sold on this system today than I was yesterday.
Instead of loading up a $100 channel with Starbucks, what I really need is a prepaid visa spendable with any merchant.  Starbucks, my local grocery store, etc would need a POS style system so that I, as the payer, would only need the one channel with the POS gateway.
Also, there seems to be no way of spending off chain coins without first putting them on chain.  This makes the whole process seem very awkward.  Unless you don't have to move coins on chain to open a channel, I don't see this system working very well.

My understanding of lightening (it is limited) is that transactions can be made incredibly quick, but they are more open to attack.  To guard against this, a bounty is issued that is made payable to anyone should one party try to break contract.  Should someone broadcast a competing transaction that breaks the contract, the transaction can be forced settled on chain.  Before it is forced settled, it can occur off chain.  
The question then becomes, if you have multiple lightening transactions, and there is a hard fork, which chain is the transaction settled on?  Both?  The one it was created on?  I'm sure someone could answer this question, but for now, I don't know how it would resolve.

"The idea is that we give each field a name and this means that 
new fields can be added or optional fields can be omitted from individual 
transactions.". 
This solution is likely to introduce new attack vectors 
that currently don't exist. New field choice could allow the creation of "clean coins", 
which would render all non new flagged coins as "dirty coins" by omission. This could 
assist miners in determining what txs not to mine, from data already contain within 
the blockchain itself. 
For example, imagine in a future world where governments mandate that your tx 
can not be mined unless you place your Real Name or Government ID Number within 
the new field option of your tx. No thanks.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:40:21
The protocol rule is, the size of everything hashed to obtain the block txid cannot be larger than 1 MB.  
In the original version, signatures were included inside the portion that was hashed.  With the signatures removed, you can effectively pack in more transactions into 1MB.  
The signatures don't go away, they're just sent as data outside the hashed portion of the block, which is kept.  
It's a capacity upgrade without the need for a hard fork.

I don't disagree.  I'm just pointing out the BCH community seems to be of the belief that a sudden and dramatic increase in hashing power will come with no disadvantages.

I imagine the following attack will happen sooner rather than later
Someone buys a large amount of BCH and withdrawals from the exchange
Once the BCH is confirmed in a block, the attacker will begin mining a new and private chain
The attacker then sends his BCH back to the exchange, sells for another crypto, and withdrawals again
With all crypto off the exchange (done in as little as a few hours), the private chain they were mining will be pushed to the network.  
If their chain has more difficulty (tough to be longer with the difficulty algo), it will orphan a  segment of chain containing the transaction in which BCH was sent to the exchange.  The attacker essentially gets two cryptos for the price of one as his original BCH is back in his posession
This will cause havoc, with exchanges having to delist BCH due to security issues

Many years ago, gold was the currency of choice.  But, there became a problem as the world markets expanded.  Doing trade between countries required you to ship large amounts of gold back and forth, and it was expensive.  Just estimate in your mind the cost of the wagons, horses, food, security, wagon repairs, time, etc, that transporting 50 tonnes of gold 500 miles would cost.
So, someone eventually got smart and created paper currency.  The paper system is *very* similar to the lightning network.  Paper currency was light weight.  It could be transported at a fraction of the cost.  And any time someone wanted to trade in their currency for gold, they could.  There was just a cost associated with going to get it.  From a historical perspective, we all know paper transactions were adopted on a large scale.  This is why old US currency has notes like 'redeemable for silver' at the bottom.  
There was risk though.  What happens if the person holding your gold or silver closed shop in the middle of the night?  Your paper IOU was now worthless.
The nice thing about lightning is, it makes it much more difficult for the shop owner to close up and skip town without risk.  All movements on the network can be seen, and justice transactions built into the system make it very unattractive to try to defraud someone.  But, the risk is still there, however small.

A problem most people don't know about signatures is that a single private key signature can produce multiple outputs for the same input.  Think of it as finding f(x) = 0 for f(x) = (× - 4)(x -3).  There are two unique and valid solutions.
Because of this problem, transactions are malleable while the signatures are included in the block because the signatures themselves are malleable.  Segwit takes signutures out and removes the malability of the transaction with it (a reference to the signature is used instead and transactions do not validate without a valid signiture).  Thus, 2nd layer solutions like lightning can work.  
BCH has not and likely will never fix this problem as they are opposed to segwit.

Two reasons.
One, fiat intentionally devalues over time.  Bitcoin offers an escape from a system of intentional devaluation.
Two, because of value analysis.  If you had a home and wanted to sell it, how do you pick an asking price?  The method all real estate agents use is to find comparable homes that recently sold and use that as the basis for the asking price of your property.  Stocks and bonds are bought and sold on exchanges by investors using a similat approach, looking for assets that are under priced or over priced.  Now, take the same approach for bitcoin, and compare to systems such as gold and USD.  Try to convince me bitcoin shouldn't be a multi trillion dollar network.

Banks hold fiat and pay miserable interest.  Maybe 1% apr if you're lucky.  They are able to do this by loaning your money and giving you a small slice of the profits.
Blockfi is basically doing the same thing, but paying 6%+ interest.  How many people do you know taking out bitcoin loans?  Who is taking out ~8% apr bitcoin loans?  Why do that when fiat loans are less expensive?  Doesn't this seem a little too good to be true?
The scheme seems ripe for defaults if prices surge upward quickly.  It's likely not a total scam, but imagine anyone taking out a loan just a few months ago when prices are in the 4,000's.  What incentive is there to pay that loan back?  
My preference is for on-exchange lending pools for margin trading, where the exchange can force margin calls if the price moves too much, thus better safe guarding against defaults.

I question how bad centralization is in LN.  With centralization in most systems, the centralized source gets to determine the rules.  Napster got shut down due to it's centralized database, whereas bittorrent could not be.  There is a lot of negative association with the word centralization in the crypto space.
But, if we have large centralized nodes on Lightning (Amazon, Bitfinex, etc), what types of problems can that lead to?  It seems, at worst, Amazon has to close it's channels and shut down it's node.  Nodes have already gone offline with no effect.  In my mind currently, large centralized nodes would just make the LN network faster.  What am I missing?

imagine you have three houses in the same neighborhood.  each looks similar, has a similar square footage, and is in similar condition.
one house sells for 1.5MM, another for 1.2MM, and the third for 200k
which house do you buy if its for investment purposes?  if you choose 200k, that would be the smart choice as it is likely to grow in value to match similar properties that are priced mucher higher.
bitcoin is a currency system just like USD, Euro, Yaun, Yin, Ruple, Rupie, Gold, etc. They all have similar properties with Bitcoin having the best stock to flow ratio come May of 2020.  Ignorance is the biggest factor keeping the price down, but it won't keep it there forever.  Bitcoin will eventually have a similar total circulating value of USD.  And when it does, the price will be over 500k a coin.
Don't look at the price of a single coin.  Look at the price of the network compared to other similar networks.

This is basically the point I'm at.  Let a dozen or so mega nodes exist on lightning and we can all connect to them.  Routing paths will be short and the mega nodes will have a high up-time guarantee.  Take it one step further with big nodes acting as a buffer between Amazon and the client to provide a step on anonymity in the transactions.  Repeat as necessary.  The only possible downside would be if the mega node decides to close all channels.

If ~~money~~ gold is not used transactionally it will likely not be money for long and not a good store of value either.
Everyone keeps forgetting history.  Gold was good, for a while, as a physical currency.  But the weight of gold became an issue just like transactions per seconds is an issue for Bitcoin.  But yet, Gold didn't become worthless just because of how difficult the logistics of gold became.  
It is still easier and cheaper and faster for me to send any amount of Bitcoin to someone in Japan than it is physical gold.  
And just like Gold, 2nd layer solutions, such as paper money, came into existence to do what gold itself could not.  Namely, to transact faster, all while maintaining Gold as the underlying commodity.  We will see the same thing happen for Bitcoin.  
If you want Bitcoin to be a POS system, then concern yourself with transaction speed.  I'll give you a heads up though, blockchain technology is not designed to be a point of sales system that can compete with the likes of American Express.  If you want it to be a store of value, the current transaction speed is just fine.

To further elaborate, in your example, if the justice state is (almkglor=0.5BTC, changes727=1.5BTC), almkglor wouldn't lose all .5 remaining BTC.  But, in my ideal situation, the justice terms would make almkglor lose perhaps 5% of the 5 btc. This 5% works out to .025 BTC total loss, but if the minimum justice fee were .03, we'd round up to a .03 penalty since that balance is still available.  
Also, is there any way to instantly open a new channel when closing a prior one to avoid on-chain fee expenses?  And, is there any chance these contracts for payment can be swapped by institutional members?  The latter seems very unlikely due to private key concerns.  Not unless there was a 3rd party key negotiator entity that facilitated contract swaps.

Everyone always has their reasons.  No doubt coinbase would keep me in the absence of the laws on Bitcoin that do exist.  The situation is just stupid.  I had a lawyer, I still have a lawyer, I researched and did everything I possible could to stay within the law, yet I still had my account closed.  I responded to their inquires, but at the end of the day, I was basically told 'sorry, we're closing you down, we won't tell you why, and we're not responding to you any more."  Again, Buttercoin and Bitfinex welcomed me with open arms.  Perhaps one day I'll make a disclosure here on the details, but while the space is still young, I'm going to enjoy the virtual monopoly on the space i've acquired.

Can I ask for some additional minor updates?
Under transactions, you use green for incoming transactions and red for outgoing transactions.  However, under balances, green is used for both.  Can we keep the same green/red system throughout the app?
When I'm sending BTC (especially if I'm sending based on converted fiat amount.  USD, etc), can you display the conversion rate on the send screen?  It's annoying to to scan the address, type $50 USD in, then suddenly start questioning what conversion rate the wallet is using.  If I back out to go to the home page to view the conversion rate, I lose the details of the transaction I was about to send.

Bitfinex (most of the time) requires confirmation via email for any btc withdrawl.  So, not having your email protected with 2FA was a major security hole.  
It seems like Bitfinex would have some added security measures when an account is accessed by an IP that geolocates in another country from where you created the account.  But, I say that with only 5 minutes of thought put into it.  I'm really not sure what other measure they could implement that would truly improve safety beyond what they have now.  
On some level, it would seem like GA would encrypt the seed required to generate the code.  So, unless there is a critical flaw like there was authy a few months back (typing in ../ bypassed the required authy code on coinbase I believe), then your device must have been compromised somehow.  
Do you log into bitfinex and your email from the same device that does GA code generation?  If so, a single malicious piece of code on a single device could compromise you completely.

How to scale Bitcoin is a hotly debated issue.  The blockchain technology, while amazing at transferring value unimpeded, is simply not designed to compete against the likes of modern database systems ran by American Express, Visa, etc.  Recently, Bitcoin Cash decided to raise the block size limit as an immediate solution for high fees and slow transaction times.  And it is working successfully.  However, raising the block size limit is a known dead end.  For Bitcoin to not just compete with American Express and Visa but to surpass them, you'd need petabyte (1000 TB) sized blocks.  This is completely impractical.  Though I'm sure the 2x block size debate will come back around, increasing the block size to meet transaction demand is just a game we're destined to lose.
Lightning, by contrast to on-chain scaling, is a 2nd tier solution for faster and cheaper transactions.  In it, instead of moving Bitcoin on-chain, you trade contracts for Bitcoin.  It is estimated that these contracts can easily be swapped at a rate of thousands of contracts per second.   These contracts can be exchanged in the same unimpeded manner as Bitcoin transactions.  To claim your Bitcoin on chain, you simply settle the contract.  Think of it as a bar tab.  It would take far too long for your bartender to run your credit card for every drink.  Plus, the credit card fees would be expensive.  So, to save time and cost, the bar tender keeps a tab (and holds your CC), and settles you at the end of the night.  This is essentially lightning.  
When Lightning finally rolls out, it will open the door for Bitcoin to be used seriously as a point of sale system.  Adoption, at that point, will be rocket fueled.

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:36:52
The simple explanation is this.  
Instead of trading bitcoin, you trade contracts.  Contracts can be traded at millions of contracts per seconds as opposed to the limit of the current Bitcoin which is ~12 transactions per second (I would say 6, but segwit gives us 2mb blocks).  There are typically 2 parties involved in a contract, and either party can decide to enforce their contract any time, which locks in the transfer on the blockchain.
Parties have an incentive not to lock in the contract on chain because of the fees involved in doing so.  Writing a new set of contracts to supersede the old one is faster and cheaper.  But, eventually, one of the parties may wish to settle, and they have the ability to force the contract to execute.
Think of it as a running tab at the bar where the barkeep has your credit card.  It's faster to just run up a tab and settle at the end of the night than try to run the card for each drink purchase.

Whoever the miner is, I imagine he's solo mining.  With solo mining, he could most certainly optimize the gaming of the EDA to his favor.  BCH got nearly 10k blocks ahead of BTC due to EDA problems.  If perfectly gamed, I'm sure this miner could easily get 100k blocks ahead within the year.  After he does that, pay the exchanges a listing fee for BCH classic, and then dump all those coins on market for significant profit.

We have seen recently that you can fake an unconfirmed transaction, though it takes some effort.  It would not be possible to fake a 1 confirmation transaction when you are using your own personal device to verify.  After 1 confirmation, it becomes extremely difficult and expensive to cancel, reverse, etc.  The size of trade matters here.

Wait a second.
Let's assume someone is mining the old BCH chain with the EDA.  
Would it not be possible for a single miner with very little hashing power to game the old BCH algorithm such that it produces a longer chain than the current BCH fork?  Remember, at the time of the recent hard fork, it was 10k blocks ahead of BTC due to miners gaming the algorithm, and that was with far less hashing power.  
This means there could be a version of BCH with a longer chain than the hard fork that complies with old difficulty rules.  
How would that affect the current bch network?

When the supply gets cut in half, the buying pressure will begin to build on the system.

You need to understand how order books work.  The price on any exchange (stock market or otherwise) is literally the last value a buyer and seller agreed on.
Imagine there are 3 buyers.  One has a bid in for 1 BTC at 600, another for 1 BTC at 500 and another for 1 BTC at 400.
If someone wants to sell 3 Bitcoin, what will the final exchange price be?
The answer is 400.  Why?  Because the seller will rip through all 3 buyers, with the lowest buyer at 400 per coin, before his order is fulfilled.  
This is known as a thin order book. Buyers and sellers make decisions for various reasons, but the ultimate impact on market price is based on what happens in the order book.
If the opposite is true... if there are 3 sellers willing to sell 1 BTC at 300, 400 and 500, and someone market orders 3 BTC, the market price will shoot back to 500

Basically, yes.
Addresses generated using MPK are of the form MPK + offset, where offset is typically a number 0 - infinity
Now, you could possibly do some crazy offset formula with your MPK for added security, but you'd need to be able to replicate that offset in generating the private keys that go with it.  
I've seen MPK's used for 2 solutions.  The first is e-commerce, and in this solution, there is zero reasons to have any private keys on the same server as your MPK.  In HD wallets, if a malicious user can get to your MPK, you're pretty SOL anyways as they've compromised your wallet hardware.

Abc and sv are in a hash war
Lots of btc hashing power was moved to support abc
This causes panic, especially as unconfirmed transactions spike and fees go up
This leads to selling, because price tends to drop on bad news or uncertainty, which leads to a drop in price
The drop in price gets more people to sell, dropping the price further.  Also, we get an onslaught of fud post encouraging selling to ensure previous sellers can buy in cheaper. 
Enough people will eventually start buying again, the production rate will get cut in half, and somewhere in all that, the price will begin climbing again

Watch the orderbook at bitcoinwisdom.com and it may make some sense
Basically, if you have lots of buyers and few sellers, it drives prices up.  Its just how markets work, supply and demand.
In stock, supply and demand gravitates toward earnings.  The price tends to keep a historical pe ratio.
In crypto, its a ton of emotions, so the swings are wilder because yoy dont have things like earnings reports to temper the price.

In simple terms, bitcoin is a distributed database of account balances.  No matter what wallet you use, the database tracks yours and everyone elses account balance.  Your public key, also called an address, is your account number.
Your password for accessing this account is your private key.  Your public key is derived from the private key.  
How you store this password is very important.  If kept online (or on a device with an internet con.ection), a user can more easily find a malicious way of accessing your private key and then emptying your account.

Here is the real deal about price.  This was true then, and it's true now.
Nobody can predict when the price will climb again.  Markets are emotional and irrational on the short term. 
 The best we can do is put a value on the system, invest accordingly, then wait.  This is the real power of the hodl strategy.  Long term, markets behave much more rationally.
Until recently, the only two viable options for currency were fiat and precious metals.  Crypto is a new and powerful player in the space.  With M2 fiat value near 21T and gold near 9T, plus the fact that USD is printed at a rate of 210B a year whereas gold is mined at a rate of 190B a year, it seems like a no brainer that crypto as a whole will eventually be valued in the trillions.
There are no guarantees in life, but if you believe the analysis above, you should be fighting daily to increase your bitcoin holdings in preparation of what the future will hold.

In 1989, the interest rate grew to over 10% apr.  The interest rates on savings accounts were huge. Using a fractional reserve bank was of value as the risk paid decent interest.
Today, interest rates are awful.  The only reason society keeps funds in banks is because of necessity with online banking services.  Paying bills becomes near impossible without funds in a bank.
As for getting loans, there are a multitude of kick starters that raise capital with no bank.  And this is frankly how investing should work.

Where do people go to discuss protocol design?
I'd like to see a testnet try running a system of blacklisting old lightning contract states.  While eltoo is in the works and will be a great addition, a blacklist protocol offers some nice advantages that can forego watchtowers.  
The system would work like this:  When a LN channel updates state, the new state will have a new revision number as part of the contract, and both parties (by current design) receive a version of that contract signed by the counterpart on the channel at each update.  With this data, a user has everything they need to request to the bitcoin network a blacklist on all previous contract states to a specific ln bitcoin address.  
By sending the network 1) a message indicating it is a blacklist request, 2) the counterparties signed contract, and 3) a signiture of the request with the second key, miners and nodes could update a table in their database which tells them to ignore any signed ln transaction on the specific btc address that has a revision number less than the most recent version now on file.  This is fair as both parties on the channel have signed against a revision number.  Any version equal to or later than the most recent on file would be valid.
There are tradeoffs with this approach, but if successful, fraud in the form of transmitting an older channel state is gone.  It also creates opportunities for ln contracts to request no blacklisting, which would require more expensive watchtower style services that would likely cost money to use.

Think of it this way.
If two people are playing poker, neither players bank account changes on each hand of the game.  Rather, poker chips are used to signify each players balance until the end of the game, and once ended, their bank accounts can each update accordingly.  In bitcoin, lightning is basically the poker chips and the bitcoin network is actual banking activity.  It would be impractical for every hand of poker to have a cooresponding bank transaction, so poker chips allow for an easy system of offloading that activity to its own set of private transactions.  
The only catch with lightning is that you have to watch the table closely to make sure nobody in the game screws you.  There will eventually be monitoring services so you can go get a drink from the bar and not worry about your chips being left unattended, but for now, you are responsible for watching your money on the table.

I think you've misunderstood me completely.  Nowhere in my post did I say or imply that rarity was the only aspect of Bitcoin that gives it value.


I never gave up that pretense.  I'm curious to know where you think I gave it up.  If the Bitcoin code changed tomorrow such that it could no longer be transferred from one individual to another, I believe the price would near instantly collapse to zero.  
My argument, specifically, is that spending Bitcoin no more increases it's value than spending a $5 Liberty gold coin increases the value of gold.  And frankly, I think anyone would be a fool to spend good money (such as pre 1965 quarters) while keeping bad.  Circulation in the form of spending Bitcoin may create awareness and attract new buyers, but the act itself is valueless (and, imo, comes at the cost of the spender).  Buying and holding is the only act that increases value.    If OP wanted to argue that more people should accept Bitcoin as payment, maybe that concept has merit.  But, I think it is very poor advice to tell anyone to spend Bitcoin before they spend their fiat.

I can say it because of the history of money and how the numbers work.
Gold was used as a currency nearly 10k years ago.  It was chosen as token for currency for very specific reasons.  1, it was rare and hard to obtain.  2 it did not rust or spoil.  3, its purity was easy to determine, 4, it could be made into different sizes/weights and still hold its ability to be useful as a currency
Until crypto, nothing else in the world worked like this.  Now, gold is being pulled out of the ground at a rate of 190B dollars a year while cryptos controlled supply cuts production in half every 4 years.  Bitcoin is designed to have better performance stats than Gold.  The volatility is a side effect of the growing adoption, but without a doubt, over a long period of time, bitcoin has consistently out performed precious metals as a value store.  Arguments can be made that crypto doesn't hold up well on a micro scale, but in the macro scale, it is undisputed in terms of performance.  That is why hodl is such a popular phrase among bitcoiners.  The macro scale is only going to look better over time.

This is exactly why gold is valuable.  It's nitch use in jewelry and electronics is dwarfed by, say, fort Knox and other government entities holding piles of it as a value store.  Everyone is speculating on the price of gold because of historical social convention.
I sold on lbc years ago.  I had many clients with very particular use cases.  A Hispanic customer could send crypto home more cheaply than western union.  A hospice facility got a discount on Chinese products because China had such tight monetary regulation their vendor offered a discount.  In these cases, bitcoin wasn't being used for the giggles of improving network value, but because of the utility it provided in the form of savings (or, desired anonymity). This reason, and only this reason, is why bitcoin should be spent (if you hold it as an investment).  Everyone else should be buying and holding with their spare fiat.

Greshams law says otherwise.
The whole idea of investing is that eventually investors do cash out.  This is why the immutable transfer power of bitcoin is so important.  No one in their right mind holds shares in a company and never sells them unless those shares pay dividends or gives you power to exercise control in the company.  
I'd challenge you to work out what the price of gold should be given its use in jewlery and electronics.  What you will find if you research is that gold is way over priced compared to its use.  The main value of Gold is in the social convention.  Explain to me why gold is so pricey, and you'll understand why I think bitcoin is going to 100k+ a coin.

Bitcoin should be the new gold.
Why?  Go back 50,000 years, and we didn't have a currency system anywhere in the world.  People bartered.  Eventually, everyone realized it was impossible to track every combination of trade.  How many chickens is a horse worth? How many chicken eggs is a cow worth?  How much wheat buys a gallon of milk?  So we invented currency to deal with this, to track all products to one common value, and there was nothing suitable besides gold and silver to act as currency.  Diamonds had various grades.  Sea shells could break.  By contrast, gold and silver could be easily divided, melted, reformed, and never tarnished.  Within the last 100 years, we've stopped using precious metals as currency only because of innovations in technology.  We need gold and silver for electronics, so it's disadvantageous for the value of those items to be inflated via use as a currency system.  Bitcoin, by all measures, is the currency system we would have used 10,000 years ago had it existed.  The comparison of Bitcoin to Gold 2.0 is very accurate imo and, despite how much I may be laughed at, I expect the market price of Bitcoin to one day surpass that of Gold.

Why would anyone buy into that system, even with the fancy platform gimmicks, when the bitcoin controlled supply rate is so much more advantageous to the holder?

bitcoin is a currency system, just like any fiat system or competing crypto
the key questions to ask are:
can the currency be easily counterfeited?  can transactions be forged?  
what is the print rate of new currency?  
how easily can the currency be transfered or traded?  this includes considering laws of use.
based on these answers, the currency value can be estimated.  based on my opinion of the answers, bitcoin is way under valued.  i await the rest of the world to wake up and reach the same conclusion

If a commodity was $100 and it goes up by 200%, is the current value $200 or $300?  I would conclude $300, but the phrasing may have been intended to say it is up by 200% [of its previous value]

From what i'm reading, far better than GBTC.  Apparently, GBTC actually sells part of the backing bitcoin each year to pay for fund management.  They then have an odd scheme of essentially stock dillution to being in more btc to keep the fund afloat.  An ETF will attempt to buy more btc if the share keeps a huge premium like GBTC does.

*This* is the mentality every bitcoin holder needs to have.  i'm always excited to see someone talk about this sort of value analysis
nobody can predict the next price movement.  but, anyone with a decent IQ will draw a similar value conclusion to OPs.  that is, the bitcoin network has huge growth potential as it is extremely likely it will end up competing with USD, Gold, etc.  the stats are just too good for anyone with half a brain to pass up.  LN will eventually scale and be stable.  every poor fiat holder is guarenteed to lose value over time.  saving money outside of crypto is all but impossible as the value of your savings is constantly and intentionally eroded.  adoption over the next few years will increase 10x, and the price per coin 100x with it.  if it wern't for the fear of this being a new and scary asset class, i think bitcoin would already be a top 3 currency by market cap

Investing 101 teaches you the basics of how to value an asset.
If you wanted to sell your house tomorrow, how would you pick an asking price?  Ask too low, and you lose money.  Ask too high, and you won't attract buyers and may evn scare them away when later lowering the price.  How suspicious would you be of looking at a 500k house that was previously listed at 1 MM?
The answers is, you look at comparible homes.  You then base your asking price based on what similar houses recently sold for.
You can take a similar approach to any other asset include currency systems.  Consider Bitcoin vs. gold vs. USD.  Which systems are censorship resistant?  What is the production rate of each system?  What is the current total circulating value?  For this last question, therw is 15T of USD, 9T of Gold, and 200 B of Bitcoin.  Which system is over valued and which is under valued based on a fair comparison table?  If you have an over valued asset, it makes sense to sell it for the under valued one.  Then, all you have to do is wait until the rest of the world slowly comes to the same realization.

Ethereum promotes inefficient on-chain use and their control supply algorythm is horrible for holders of their currency.

I say start the new cap size at 2 Mb (it will be needed by the time the code is finished), change the vote from 80/20 to 70/30, and we have a winner.
If a pool isn't voting the way you like, leave the pool and join one that votes your way.  
If a malicious player tries to tank the system by keeping blocks small (or, making them too large), then we'll find ourselves in the EXACT SAME SITUATION as every other proposal on the table.  That is, we will have to emergency hard fork to make the required corrections.  There is no proposal out there that cannot be gamed.  Even the current code could be totally shattered if the vast majority of mining pools suddenly chose to all make 0 transaction sized blocks.  
As it stands, BIP 100 has the most future-proofing potential of any proposal I've seen.  It is also the most dynamic since miners can actively vote to make changes without another hard fork.  Let's take a risk.  Let's make this happen.

I'll go back to what I said earlier about PID loops.  
In mechanical engineering, PID loops are a taught system for creating stability.  Imagine how your car would be if there was no combination spring damper suspension system.  It would be terrible.  The car would probably shake you half to death.
Taking a moving average of the past 2016 blocks essentially readjusts difficulty every block using the same algorithm.  The problem you introduce is, there are cases where 2 blocks are mined within seconds of each other.  How would a moving average algorithm account for this?  There is measurable lag time between nodes, and changing difficulty target requirements on the fly on a global scale is simply not practical.  You can get away with doing this every 2016 blocks, possibly even for less, but not for every block without having problems in creating orphans.

Negative.  I reached this conclusion on my own.  I don't care about curves and past history so much.  They're helpful for projecting when an event might occur (and in this case, my guess is 2021), but value analysis is my primary tool.  
Here is a similar analogy I did recently with stock.  
I'll break it down for anyone interested.
Road Runner Transport does $2B in freight line revenue annually.  Recent earnings calls project growth to 2.2B over the next year.  Their stock market cap is currently just over 100MM.  Their stock price is down from the $20 per share range to sub $3.  They are down due to numerous mis-steps by management, some accounting fraud, and other reasons.  But, they're not going bankrupt.  They've brought in new management, they're making smart moves in the sector, and the transport sector/economy is red hot.  They will eventually start showing a profit on their balance sheets, and when they do, this stock will rocket up over $10 a share.  Stock, especially in this small cap sector, is highly tied to P/E ratios.  Historically, the company has held a P/E ratio of 20.  A simple $0.50 per share in profit puts us at the $10 mark.  They could easily go over $1 a share.  I expect this to happen within the next year, two years top.  New management is expecting stated in their last conference call they're expecting rapidly rising profits.  Their Q1 earnings would have been profitable had it not been for all their legal fees due to the accounting fraud.  
All this is very simple to see once you know what you're looking for.  You just have to park your money in the system where you know it will grow and then hodl, even during the temporary downturns.

"FinCEN finds that, as the company is going beyond the activities of a broker or dealer in commodities and is acting as a convertible virtual currency administrator (with the freely transferable digital certificates being the commodity-backed virtual currency), the company falls under the definition of money transmitter."

It is not beneficial to readjust every single block.  There is no significant change of processing power within the network from block to block.  
Also, difficulty already takes the past 2016 blocks into account.  If you were to average the past 5000 blocks, difficulty would be calculated lower than it is today.  Is that want you want?  Because the solution you just proposed would have that outcome.  
Guesswork mathematics like this needs to stay out of Bitcoin.  Properly tuning PID loops is a very challenging problem.

In 2009/2010, I read an article about it.  The only points I remember from the article were "it's an all digital currency" and "it disproportionally rewards early investors".  
I went home, downloaded the Bitcoin software (knowing nothing of the system), and it started to run.  It sounded like it was eating my computer from the inside out.  The memory paging was out of control.  As I sat there, not knowing a single thing about the system other than the two key points above, I deduced that I had installed a spam distribution software system that rewarded me in fake digital currency.  I figured I was getting 'credits' for every 1M emails I sent out or some BS.  And what was worse, I did some math, and figure my computer running like it was running would run my light bill up more than the value of credits I would get in return.  So, I promptly uninstalled.  
It uninstalled too easily.  The next 10 seconds I wish I could relive.  Instead of putting it back on and just letting go, reading more about the system, etc, I counted my blessings that it came off too easily and kept going about my life.

In the worst case, you had a roughly 5x move.  In the best, nearly 20x
I'm betting the next move takes us to 100k+.  That puts market cap at $2T, less lost coins, and less coins to be mind (3M or so), which is where we all know it belongs.  The top 10 banks world wide all control $2T+ in assets.  No way Bitcoin shouldn't be competing with the top 10 banks in terms of total asset value held.

A user posted here some weeks ago about his coinbase account being hacked.  Things that happened:
Hacker gained control of users email account.  What email service do you use?
Hacker got control of his phone and forwarded all messages.  Is there any way you can tell, through a web portal or calling customer support, to see if your phone calls or text have been compromised?  This is why many recommend authy or google auth.  
Hacker gained access of coinbase account.  Now, with email and phone compromised, you would have never seen evidence of the attack as it could be deleted.

If you live in the US:
For the lazy:
Cash Purchases of $3,000-$10,000, Inclusive
MSBs that sell money orders or traveler’s checks are required to record cash purchases involving $3,000- $10,000, inclusive [i'm adding my own interpretation here that says Bitcoin qualifies for the same record keeping requirements due to 
Multiple cash purchases of monetary instruments totalling $3,000 or more must be treated as one purchase which must be recorded if:
1. They are made at the same time, or
2. The MSB has knowledge that such purchases occurred during one business day.
How to record a money order or traveler’s check sale for cash of $3,000-$10,000, inclusive:
**1. Verify and record customer information, including ID.**  
2. Record transaction information – amount, date of sale and serial number(s) for each instrument.  
3. Keep the record for 5 years from the date of transaction.

The only way to trade in any market is to value invest.
In the late 90s, there was a tech boom.  Companies like red hat and pets.com had huge stock gains.  But, there came a day when they posted earnings yet again as a loss when investors panicked, realized they could go bankrupt, and we had a market crash.
The same happened with the housing market.  Housing prices were so hot, companies were giving loans to people with no income, no job, and no personal assets.  The momentum of the housing market kept prices climbing until it didn't.
TA is bullshit.  The behavior of people can be estimated, but with no degree of certainty.  However, value investors almost always win.  As an extreme example, if there were 50 homes in a neighborhood that sold for 300k, all the same same floor plan, and one came on the market selling for 200k, would you be inclined to buy that house even if it had been on the market for over a year?  As long as nothing is wrong with it, you should, as it is selling for far less than its comparibles.
The 10 largest banks in the world all hold at or in excess of 2T.  Alll gold in the world has a net value of 9T.  My value analysis says bitcoin is comparable to a top 10 world bank if not gold.  It's future market cap should end up being between 2T and 9T.  You cant rely on people being instantly rational, which is why the market moves so much.  But you can absolutely count on the market eventually reaching the appropriate equilibrium after many years.  This is why i hold and will never give up a single satoshi gambling on TA until we get in that value range.

The TLDNR:
Google Auth and several other programs rely on a shared secret.  You put in x123b768 (or whatever), a key that a site gives you, and Google Auth uses that Key + a timestamp to generate a code.  This has the implied vulnerability that some can intercept the shared secret.
A better way is to give a site your public key at time of registration.  Then, when the site needs you to verify something important, you can sign a message (a unique message generated by the site) using your private key that the site can then verify.  There is no shared secret in this scenario.  
Not a bad idea really.  I'm just not familiar with a good app that uses this approach.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:38:26
Very true.  But, selling software hasn't been classified as money transmission by anyone anywhere, and I don't suppose it ever will be.  
We all know FinCEN has classified the sale of Bitcoin as money transmission.  But, their reach is limited to the US (or, somewhat to companies targeting advertisements to US citizens.  The Bit License, for example, doesn't care what part of the world you're in.  You can't sell to NY citizens without their license).  The IMF seems to be friendly toward Bitcoin, and I have not seen any IMF regulation that classifies it as money transmission, but I also could have missed such a ruling as I don't follow them closely.  
How individual members of the EU define money transmission gets outside of my experience.  
You could, very technically, argue that ID is *not* required for purchases less than 13k.  Maybe you win.  But, maybe you find yourself in front of a jury one day, and maybe it is discovered you were selling Bitcoin to the Paris attack ring leader, and maybe the jury decides you knew what you were doing was money transmission and you never developed an AML or checked ID.  You tell me if it's worth the risk.  There is an awful lot of legal liability that can potentially be avoided simply by collecting ID.

I believe in the intent of AML/KYC.  I don't believe in many of the laws that put transactions under the AML microscope.  I think the government would be much more effective regulating drug sales and prostitution (and taxing them I guess) as opposed to trying to stop them outright.  We only had shootouts, deaths, and an overall crime war when alcohol was illegal as opposed to post legalization. 
Again, I'm only for AML/KYC as a measure to stop violent crime.  
@_date: 2015-11-25 19:28:33
You're right, it does not make a lot of sense.  The problem is, KYC/AML law was not written with Bitcoin in mind.  The result is sort of a square peg round hole problem.  It was previously assumed that only large financial companies could ever transmit money, and it makes some sense for large financial institutions to know who they're doing business with.   And, frankly, nobody wants to go through the effort of changing the law just so a few small BTC sellers can have an easier time.
Any LBC seller with high trust doing large volume has suddenly found themselves in a position of having too much to lose if some government agency wants to make an example out of them for not following international KYC rules.  So, to protect their own ass 'just in case', they now ask for ID.

Maybe I misunderstood.  On my first read, I thought you were advocating the employee use a single public [address] throughout their employment.  My concern was that there are security issues with accepting multiple payments to a single address, especially if the employee must move those funds often from that address to, presumably, pay bills every month.  
My idea was that the employee offer up a single public master key (which could generate an unlimited number of addresses, just like a word seed, but without compromising the private key.  The corresponding private master key would be kept private).  It would be easy for the employer to then prove payments to the series of public master addressed defined by the contract while preserving the security on behalf of the employee.  
It seems that you almost want a signature with each paycheck from the employee stating that they were paid (or maybe I'm misreading?).  That seems a little burdensome imo.

If LE only went after the really bad guys, privacy concerns would be mostly moot.

You could still make it auditable.  Every vote could trace back to an address, and if needed, each address to a username.  I'm not sure if you'd want to do the latter for the sake of anonymity.  The only question would then be, does the owner of a particular address actually exist?  In such cases, it would be easy to prove without compromising security if it became a major issue.  Just have the user send funds to a new address and revalidate the new address signature.

The law isn't intended to stop anyone from becoming crazy.  No law can stop people from going crazy.  AML regulation is intended to create a trail to find people who are already crazy.  The hope is, you can find a criminal before they can hurt someone a second time.


The Paris terrorist didn't even encrypt their messages.  Why would they go to the trouble of getting fake ID's?  That doesn't mean they won't or can't, but it does show that everyone makes mistakes.  Forcing the ID rule creates another avenue for criminals to slip up and out themself.   
There are real benefits (and downsides) to collecting ID from buyers.  It cannot hut a BTC seller to take ID.  It sounds like you disagree on principal and privacy reasons (which I understand), but I tend to think in terms of legal liability and covering my ass in the worst case scenario.  So, I fully support sellers taking ID from buyers.

Cash has the weight of money problem.  I posted this elsewhere, but it is the act of putting money into banks that is considered laundering (thus the need for an anti-money *laundering* policy), not the act of gaining money from crime.  It does a large criminal organization no good to have cash if transporting that cash is logistically impossible (thus the need to launder into the banking system).
And, again, the fed does not review all records just as it does not review all communications.  It is when suspicion is aroused that the fed is alerted and takes a look.  In this sense, yes, I am in favor of those type of activities (though I believe communications snooping should require a warrant).

This is beautiful.  I don't know that I'd ever use it, but its beautiful.
Edit:  Upon closer inspection, this doesn't seem to work like traditional stock options.  This is more of a gambling site that works off future Bitcoin pricing as opposed to a random number generator.  
A traditional option would sell you the 'right to buy' or 'right to sell' Bitcoin for X dollars Y hours/days from now.  
Example:  I have 1 Bitcoin.  The current price is $200.  I will offer a (Put Option) contract to allow someone to buy my 1 Bitcoin for $190 @ 30 days from today.  The cost of that contract is set by me.  Lets say it's $5.  
If, in 30 days, the value of Bitcoin is more than $195, the buyer makes money.  Lets say the value is $300.  The player just made $105 off a $5 bet.  The seller 'loses' his 1 Bitcoin in exchange for $190 (plus $5 previously given for the contract).  
This could be set up to run entirely in Bitcoin.

That's the real problem.  There is no good way to separate the good guys from the bad guys apart from studying financial records.  Many times, criminal organizations will purposefully seek out clean, white, suburban housewives with absolutely no criminal record to make bank deposits on their behalf in hopes of disguising their activities.  It is a sophisticated cat and mouse game.


Every exchange already implements KYC policies.  If you're relying heavily on your bitcoin transactions being anonymous, you'll probably have a bad time.  The best you can hope for is plausible deniability.  I would be very much surprised if coins that left a major exchange like coinbase changed hands any more than a dozen times before finding their way back onto a major exchange.  That isn't a very long or hard trail to follow, especially since nobody who sold you coins is going to be willing to go to jail to conceal your privacy.

Federal registration as an money service business, afaik, is free.  There are only stiff penalties for failure to comply with the policies.
It's the state level that can get you.  In some states, they have no money service laws.  Most other states only have laws to protect the end users (aka, financial institutions must be bonded, FDIC insured, or whatever).  The fees for some of the states, especially NY's Bitlicense (and the cost to do the paperwork to comply), is what I have a problem with.  But, the intent of the states for the most part is to keep people from running fraudulent financial services and taking every dime of customer funds.  There is a fine line here between forced consumer protection by the state and overbearing AML.  


No, it's not.  AML policies don't force you to provide the government with live financial transaction streams.  They require financial institutions to keep records and only file reports if the activity they see looks suspicious.  
This would be akin to requiring you to call 911 if you see someone who appears to be getting raped.  I'm sorry your freedoms are being violated by being forced to dial 911 on behalf of another person, but lets pick our battles.

I don't think so, but I could be wrong.
The way I understand it is if a share of stock is $100, and you have $100, buying on margin will allow you to buy 10 times more than you could usually buy.  Instead of getting 1 share for your $100, you can borrow 10 shares for $100.  You can then get margin called if the price changes too drastically.  In this case, if you go long on margin, and the price drops by $10, you lose your $100.  If you go short on margin, and the price climbs by $10, you will also get margin called and lose your $100.
I'm not exactly sure how futures work, but I believe they are like put and call options but without the leverage.

What happens when someone's bank account was hacked, and funds were transferred to you without the true owners consent?  When you get taken to court by the real owner, would it benefit you to at least have the ID of the person who you thought was buying from you?  Bank transfers make it even more important to have the buyers ID.  
There are a ton of Bitcoin scams out there.  AML isn't just for terrorism prevent, but from other low level crime prevention.  
Also, if you're a big seller with 1000's of buyers, how shitty does it look to be doing 1000 * $100 in sales per week and have *no ID to back up where the funds are going*.  What does it make it look like you're doing?  How will a Jury see it?

The argument from the credit card company is, theft is rampant, and it is more difficult to steal if you accept credit card payments.
If you are an all cash business, it wouldn't be too difficult for a malicious cashier to pocket a bunch of money one night.  If you want to combat this, you hire security to pat everyone down and watch them on videos.  But, even then, it's tricky.
Credit card companies say 'why go to all that expense when you can just take a CC payment for 2% and forego the ability of your cashiers to steal'?  Many business owners sleep more peacefully paying this fee, so they do.

So, lets have a real discussion about this for a minute.
Money Laundering is the act of concealing the origins of money obtained through illegal activity.  Most people here think of that in terms of simple drug sales, but the problem can go much deeper.
ISIS, for example, has been described as one of the best funded terrorist groups in the world:
Now, how does ISIS get it's money?  It's mostly through Money Laundering, for which Bitcoin is a magnet.  Lets say ISIS raids a oil production facility and steals all the oil.  In order for that oil to be useful, they have to sell it.  Once they find a buyer (who is willing to look the other way for profit), they are then left with the problem of putting the money into the banking system so it can be useful all while avoiding suspicion.  You can't just walk into the bank with 2 duffle bags of cash and nobody ask questions.  Bitcoin is a good conduit to facilitate such transfer.  Through a network of smurfs (you can google the term), Bitcoin can be purchased with cash, and then liquidated on an exchange under the story of "i'm a long term holder" or some other cover.  Or, more directly, the oil could be sold for Bitcoin. Now, ISIS or Black Market sellers can more easily profit from their activities, which just leads to more of the same type of illegal activities.  
I don't believe anyone here wants to fund ISIS.  But, ISIS is an extreme story, so lets use another example.
The movie Sicario is all about drugs coming from Mexico.  [Spoiler Alert].  In it, there is a scene where a women is putting $9k cash into a bank account every day.  The $9k is supposedly to prevent automatic CTR reporting, though I'm sure someone at the bank would see $9k in cash daily as suspicious.  The money placement was done by multiple individuals, usually unsuspecting people like middle class white women, in order to conceal the money derived from drug activity.  The middle class smurfs in this story were no doubt receiving some sort of financial kickback.
Why do we care?  Well, in this particular story, the Mexican drug lord was killing a fuck ton of people over the whole war on drugs.  The killings all came about because money laundering allowed drug sales to be profitable.  
A good solution here would be to consider ending the war on drugs, but that's another topic.  The fact that there is a war between governments and drug lords which leads to a lot of killing is a problem.  
Some more considerations.  Have you ever stopped to consider the amount of violence in east African countries?  Many of these countries don't have strict anti-money laundering practices (they don't care, they're just glad to see the money coming in).  As a result, crime becomes highly profitable with little risk, which just goes to perpetuate a culture of crime and violence.  
So, why do these companies want to look so hard at your cash flow?  Because A) The penalties for having an ineffective AML policy are stout and B) These groups attend seminars on which the above is explained in much higher detail.  How bad would it suck for Coinbase for the FBI to pay them a visit one day just to let them know their failure to regulate helped fund an ISIS attack on the US?  
I'm sure most people here don't think that can happen or doesn't happen, but I'm convinced that it does.  So, just take that into consideration next time you have to prove your identity or tell these companies what you're spending BTC on.

They are great, but I have had 3 issues with them.
The first is that I had a transaction that kept showing up as pending.  I'd open the app, then for a brief second panic as I saw a ~$200 withdrawal in progress.  Fortunately, there was a persistent sync error that was making it happen and I didn't lost anything.
Second, after seeing the first error a few dozen times, the wallet crashed and I couldn't get it to open again.  It would get to the 'enter your pin screen', then throw a 'application has failed' error.
Edit:  Support hooked me up though, and we got everything working again.  I think we just had to clear the cache.
Third, i think with the tx malleability attack, I had several transactions that got stuck as pending/unbroadcasted.  I had to go through a learning process to figure out how to cancel those, then everything worked fine afterwards.  I couldn't spend until they were gone completely.  
Edit: Fourth, I had an issue months ago with nodes not being able to connect correctly.  
But, overall, a very good wallet with a solid design team.  I'm looking forward to the next set up upgrades.

Let me spell a few things out real quick (this applies to all of the USA).
1 - If you buy in large quantities from any exchange (coinbase, circle, buttercoin, anywhere), they will start questioning your purchases.  Why?  Because the government makes them.  If they don't question, they get shut down, so they question to avoid being shut down.  Believe me when I say they're rather not have to ask anyone about anything.  This greatly affects sellers on places such as LBC.
2 - If a buyer has a MSB license, these exchanges (coinbase, circle, buttercoin, etc) will give them a free pass.  They can sell to them all day long now because they are not re-selling illegally, but they are reselling with a federal license.  
3 - If you buy from a LBC seller that is federally licensed, they will most likely ask for a copy of your license.  *They do not have to send this anywhere*.  That is, unless you are making purchases &gt; $10k OR frequent/weekly purchases over ~$5k.  The main reason for checking is to ensure you're not on a list of known terrorist suspects.  They also must keep it on file in case they get audited by FinCEN.  And even if someone does show up on your doorstep questioning why you're buying Bitcoin, just deny it!

The history of money is very interesting.  We all take for granted why the dollar has value.  
50k years ago, there was no money.
30k years ago, gold and silver was used as currency
400 years ago, if you would have told the Venetians that the paper note issued by a bank was a better system than physically holding gold or silver, they would have laughed you off the island, as they did Marco Polo
Within the past 60 years, the US dollar was taken off the gold standard
Places like Argentina have runaway inflation.  Hyper inflation is a real thing in many countries.  Before Argentina, it was the Zimbabwe dollar.  
Bitcoin is designed to have low inflation.  It is a currency that can be transported from one individual to another with high resistance to government interference.  That makes it a valuable currency system. and the price of a single Bitcoin reflects that.

$10 a month or $10k a month?
Any purchase by an individual, or by a group on behalf of one individual, within 24 hours, that totals $10k or more, automatically requires a CTR (currency transaction report) to be filed by a licensed seller.  If you ask to buy $10k, are told a CTR will be filed, and now ask to buy $9k, a SAR (suspicious activity report) has to be filled.  Any LBC or other seller looking to not go to jail in an undercover buying sting has to comply with these rules.
For lesser amounts, there are no concrete rules.  Anything 'suspicious' has to be reported.  Buying more than $5k at a time or $5k weekly may trigger required reporting.  But, even if someone reports you for buying, Bitcoin is a legal commodity.  If you are doing something illegal with it, that becomes another issue.  Perhaps the cops get the report and decide to pay you a visit.  Idk what happens from there.

As far as we've come, more thought still needs to be put into bitcoin storage.
There was a great post here last week about someone getting their coinbase account hacked and all their coins stolen simply because the thief cracked their email.  The story went something like this:
Email was breached.  Emailed contained data about users phone company.  That data was used to then breach the phone by having all calls forwarded including audio readouts of google authenticator  pins.  With email, phone and 2FA broken, the thief gets into the account and takes all the coins.
Using F2A seemed like a powerful security enhancement until I read that.  Now, I'm not sure what to think.

This still does nothing to solve a future problem in which you need 14 transactions a second just to stay even with demand while the network can only do 7 at best.  That would create a full days backlog if not more every day of transactions that cannot go through.

Selling BTC, even locally, is often considered a type of money transmission.  There are laws requiring money transmitters to know who they are selling to, and the only legit way to do that is through getting photo ID.
If you are LE trying to sniff out money transmitters not enforcing AML policies, and they don't ask for ID, they could be arrested, charged a 25k fine, and sent to jail.
Do you think sellers should risk these penalties just so you don't have to show ID?

USD can't be transferred easily.  Try getting $1M in physical cash to anywhere else in the world.  
@_date: 2015-11-11 15:44:38
First, cash purchases are more highly subjected to AML regulation than you're leading on.  You simply cannot go to a car dealership and pay for a new car with all cash like you can with a check or credit card (nor can you get through an airport with that much cash).  Even FinCEN has stated that cash is still king when it comes to money laundering.  
Second, the reason you don't blame cash as much is because of the weight of money problem.  Criminals have a need not just for money, but the ability to send it quickly and to carry it easily.  The weight of $1M in $1 bills is slightly over 2000 lbs.  This is why, I suppose, the $500 bill was taken out of circulation, as it facilitated criminal activity more so than anything else.  
Money laundering isn't about having or carrying cash, it's about getting that cash into systems that can move it easily and thus further facilitate illegal activity.  Gaining cash from criminal activity is just a crime.  Getting that money into banks is money laundering.  AML isn't [supposed to be] focused as much on stopping prostitution as it is preventing the money gained from Trafficking from getting back to the criminal organizations that kidnap women and send them abroad into a life of forced sexual service.  
I don't think it's the AML concerns everyone is so bent out of shape over, it's the stupid laws such as drug prohibition that then get brought under the money laundering umbrella of regulation.

The whole concept of money laundering isn't BS, just ~~most of it~~ a lot of how it gets applied.
ISIS is considered one of the most well funded terrorist organizations in the world.  I think everyone here would love to see ISIS burn, but they have become difficult to stop partially because they're so well funded.  But, where do you think ISIS gets all their money from?  Money Laundering is the act to hiding financial profits that come from illegal activity.  The strategy for AML is to prevent groups like ISIS from profiting, or to effectively shut down violent criminals like Al Capone (remember that Al Capone was brought down for tax evasion).  Much of the cycle of violence seen in East Africa or in parts of Mexico comes from local financial establishments not enforcing AML because doing so would eat into their precious profits.  Trafficking is a major problem because it continues to be hugely profitable.  Taking away the ability to profit from violence through AML measures is extremely effective at stopping violence.  The unfortunate part is, we have all sorts of silly anti-drug laws on the books, and LE turns around and uses money laundering to go after people that don't really matter.

I love the app.  A few questions though.
You have accounts / balances / transactions / addresses across the top of the app.  Why is  / addresses not shown with the other 3?  I am use to it now, but it was really weird when I first started.  It seems like you'd want all your menu options on one page.  Perhaps these could be renamed if letter space is the driving factor?  Or maybe given just a symbol?  I would be ok with transactions just being Tx
Why can I not type in a private key manually?  Why must I have it in the clipboard?
Why are pins so small?  6 characters is good and all, but it seems like I could have some letter options here as well.  If someone steals my phone, how hard is it to break a 6 character pin?  Perhaps you could enable some sort of email support such that 10 failed pin attempts locks you out until you can confirm you still have your phone via email?
Can you comment on how private keys are stored in the app?  Is there any encryption?  If someone takes my phone, can they just lift a file out of it to get my private keys, or is there a more robust defense against this?

I don't think you quite understand AML.     
The whole point of AML laws is to give law enforcement an inside track on identifying violent criminal organizations.  Maybe LE can't find an illegal brothel where women trafficked in from other nations are being forced to live a life of prostitution, but sniffing out the money trail may very well lead them to it.  No doubt, if drugs and prostitution were legally regulated, nobody here would give a shit about AML policies.  If LE only used AML to go after truly violent offenders, nobody would give a single fuck.  The problem, which many people rightfully complain about (and what I believe you are complaining about), is that LE uses AML to fulfill their own superiority complex and justify going after the wrong fucking people.  
ISIS is the best funded terrorist organization in the world.  They regularly steal a ton of oil, and then sell it on the black market under market rates.  The buyers turn a blind eye because, hey, big profits!  But, a major oil company is out of oil, everyone's insurance goes up, and we have a huge terrorist attack in Paris with over 120 dead (with more attacks on the way).  That level of violence is not ok.  Financial privacy is not some sacred privilege when full disclosure does greatly reduce violent crime.  All AML does is force financial institutions to ask questions and report to police when the source of funds are suspicious.  Question such as "hey, what sort of business is this group engaged in that is deposting $50k cash every single day of the week?  That amount isn't normal for a business registered as a hot dog vendor, so what's going on here?"  When applied to outing members of groups like ISIS, more power to them.

You can now own Bitcoin (via contract) without any of the security risks.

I'm not sure bank accounting is relevant.  Counting a loan as an asset is just a form of accounting.  The real trouble is when banks are short money and cannot repay account holders.  Better accounting practices may help prevent this, but other measures, such as due diligence, are more effective.  
Two of the problems with the housing crisis that I feel were major factors in the whole economic collapse of 2009 were A) predatory lending practices (aka, giving people loans that could not afford to pay them ) and B) maliciously inflated housing prices (that is, many developers and sellers were getting unrealistic appraisals on their house, which banks did not challenge, and ultimately, the market could not support.  These appraisals were then used to justify home loans).  The combination of the two put people with low income into a house they thought was valuable, but in reality, was not.  When there were finally hundreds of thousands of homes on the market that nobody could sell (prices were skyrocketing, so there must be some unseen demand, right?), prices came crashing down and many people couldn't stomach putting their entire paycheck into a home that was now worth half of what they bought it for.  They defaulted, and the banks were left holding the bag.  Everyone was hurt as a result.

So, ID has never been useful?  Never, in the history of the world has asking for ID helped lead to a criminal conviction?  Just because ID isn't 100% effective doesn't mean it's never effective.  


If a bank account is hacked, and the hacker moved money from the hacked account to your account, how are you going to sell that story to a Jury?  If you think you can sell it, then more power to you.  There was a Jude Judy episode recently where the seller lost because of how sketchy his story was.


Selling gold is not considered money transmission.  But, if someone bought more than ~10k of gold with cash, guess what?  The seller would be forced to take ID.


Money transmission activities mostly solve the weight of money problem.  That is, criminals need to move money quickly and as anonymously as possible.  AML laws are in place to make it more difficult for criminals to profit, which in turn reduces crime.  That is the key difference.  No criminal organization anywhere is being profitable through chainsaw purchases, and if they were, AML would most certainly get applied to those types of sales.

Partitioning a block would only add extra data to a block without providing room for more transactions.  What happens if you can't fill the 2MB partition?  Or, if you can't fill the 6MB partition?  Prioritization should be left in the hands of miners.  Also, just because the block limit size is increased doesn't mean all block sizes will increase.  IMHO, unless there is a technical reason for the 20 MB limit, this should be a step increase that happens based on how many transactions we see in a week.  If, for an entire week, we are near the limitations of the network, then double the block size.  The only catch 22 here is, fees may need to increase (or, at least, have a mandatory minimum fee per transaction).  If I were malicious, I could attempt to send so many transactions that I would bloat the blockchain size until it is no longer practical to store.

That is possible, though I doubt they could keep it too secret as there would be a notable drop in hashing power on the other chain.

Google ipo'd in 2004 around $100 a share.  Lots of stocks 10x'd or more in 14 years.  Amazon, apple, priceline, netflix, etc.  Its actually pretty easy to find a service you use that makes good profits quarterly and park your money there.  Some of the best performing stocks over a 30 year period are actually relatively overlooked.  Gilead Sciences, for example, averaged over 20% yearly returns from 1996 thru 2016.  Who the fuck are they youre probably asking yourself right now.
Op has a good point though.  Most people dont act rationally when it comes to finance.  Most americans have little savings, lots of debt, and simply make poor finance choices.  Frankly, i trust bitcoin more than i do people to be rational.  If everyone was rational, bitcoin prices would be at the moon already.

Many of the pools would have to collude to mine empty blocks on the chain in order to intentionally destroy the value of the reward they were mining.  Seems silly, but sure, they *could* do that.

Let's just state some obvious facts.
ETH shills are now frequenting these subs trying to get BTC holders to switch allegiance in order to drive up further the price of their coin.  I can't blame them.  They have money at stake and the value of any currency including crypto is based on trust.  Undermine that trust, and the system collapses.  Build more trust, and the system thrives.  Their efforts are to undermine Bitcoin while promoting ETH.  
There is nothing ETH has done of any value that BTC has not already done.  Smart Contracts and the turning complete ETH is just fancy marketing.  Until there is a killer app that depends upon these technologies, it's just a shitty vapor ware alt coin.  There is no reason to switch to ETH anymore than there is LiteCoin.  In fact, what I'd really like to see is a comparison of ETH performance claims to LTC with Segwit.  
BTC is currently like a car with a flat tire.  During it's prime, the transaction speeds were reasonable and the fees were low.  Today, it suffers from filled mempools and high fees.  But, those issues can be fixed.  There is no need for a new car, unless, of course, nobody can come to an agreement on how to replace the tire.  Which, frankly, is where we are today.  Too many have become impatient with waiting to get the tire fixed, so they've bought a new car that has 4 fully functioning tires.

I get how attacking another chain could be profitable.  Especially if the attacks destroy it.
But, greed is 100% the driving factor in all of this.  Assuming Bip148 gets 30% of the current hashing power, that means roughly 50% of all hashing power of every other miner would need to attack the new chain to implement a 51% attack.  That is an awfully expensive attack, not just in that they are dedicating resources to produce 0 value, but that those resources have opportunity cost in that they could be working on their chain of choice.
But, even then, maybe they do it out of spite.  I don't know.  How long can they be spiteful for?  Days?  Weeks?  The price of BTC crashing all while alts explode?  It's financial suicide at some point.  And the miners that won't signal are too greedy for that.

Furthermore, it is used like currency, has the word 'coin' in its name and markets itself as a 'digital currency'.

Ah.  I thought this was obvious, but I will explain my reasoning.  
Let's make a bold assumption and says Switzerland outright legalizes CC.  They are the only country in the world to do so.  They also tax all CC transactions at their banks at 1%.  Furthermore, BTC can be used freely by vendors, merchants and customers to provide a basis of demand for the currency.  Ie, to create a base GDP to make CC valuable and to attract more investors thus more CC transactions and more international tax revenue.
If you are savvy with money, you will quickly realize that the interest from your bank account doesn't keep up with inflation.  Even Bond rates don't keep with inflation.  So, what do you do?  Move your savings into CC.

It doesn't require the backing of a physical entity.  The backing for BTC is goods and services.  Before currency, there was a bartering system.  Then someone, not unlike Satoshi, found a better system through currency.  It didn't take overnight, but eventually those who produces goods or services came to accept the currency as payment.  This is happening with btc now.  It is history repeating.  It will eventually grow strong enough to weaken the USD and Euro, and then things will get ugly.

Question:  How does it seed the encryption algorithm for the private keys?
Edit:  I'm really curious about the seeding of the private key if this is a single button.  As an FYI, there are roughly 3.1e10 milliseconds in a year.  So, if this thing simply takes the current # milliseconds from ~1970 (its a unix thing) to seed, it would be easy for someone to attempt powering through that span of numbers to produce pairs of public/private keys, doing a lookup to see if any of those publics had value, and hacking all your monies.
Edit 2:  If multiple button presses were used in generating the seed, security would be greatly improved.

It is fairly significant.  While Bitcoin can stand on it's own, Lightning is the next step forward in development, allowing for transactions to happen as fast as an email can be sent and received without any sacrifice in potential centralization due to chain size.  Many cryptos claim faster transaction speeds, but what they don't disclose is the sacrifices in terms of long term data storage that had to be made to achieve that speed.  Lightning allows for Bitcoin to have it's cake and eat it to, gaining speed, but without any sacrifices.  
One of the major advancements for Lightning that is still yet to be introduced (and why Lighnting is still vulnerable to criticism) is ElToo and Watch Towers.  I have specifically been trying to find more information on ElToo, but as I have not been able to find the specific information I'm after, I'm going to explain it the best I can imagine in hopes of being corrected with accurate information and advancing my own knowledge.
ElToo (I believe) will require each channel to have a noonce value.  Much like the noonce value in API calls to Poloniex or Bitfinex, each update of a channels balance will also require the contract between the two parties to reference a noonce value that must be higher than the previous nonce of the previous channel state.  This allows for a means of invalidating previous channel states without storing the state of every channel change.  All that is required is 1) the hash of the original channel state when it was open and 2) the most recent channel noonce, 3) the corresponding signatures.  When a channel balance is changed, ElToo will allow each wallet (primarily, the wallet that gain and not lost on the balance) to send signatures from both parties to the Bitcoin node/miner network that updates the Lightning network channel with a more recent revision (noonce).  Each node will then update a database that they will keep (requires a soft fork) of the most recent channel states.  When a channel is closed, the node may prune all data associated with that channel.  When a channel is updated, all that is required are the signatures, new nonce, and original channel script hash.  If someone tries to broadcast a previous channel state, the nodes will reject it, effectively making previous states useless.  While some nodes may be bad actors and intentionally broadcast older states, the majority of nodes are assumed to be working together to invalidate any transaction (and thus any block) that comes from an older state.  
Coupled with watchtowers (which will be like moving a court case from local state court to the supreme court), and amp (which provides means of routing through multiple nodes in parallel to transfer value), lightning will be a tour de force of ridiculous proportions.

"The dollar I had in my wallet last night may have lost a fraction of it's value overnight to inflation, but the bitcoin I had last night is worth 25% less as of the time of this posting. "
You could also say, the dollar I have now is worth a fraction less than what I had at the beginning of the year, but the BTC I owned at the beginning of this year is worth a lot more today.  The dollar I have now is worth a significant percent less than a few years ago, but a BTC from 4 years ago is up several orders of magnitude today.
It's not fair to compare the dollar to CC at this point.  CC is still growing (or dying if you want to argue that point).  My reasoning is in a time line 4+ years down the road and is based on a country fully adopting/embracing the system.  It is, as of this moment, a soft currency.  The backing of a single nation would potentially change that.  
If Bitcoin were backed by Switzerland and the volatility stopped, how would that change your opinion?

Everything you just described requires the willingness of local investors to trade their currency for BTC.
You say "As long as they have some price, like a penny, then I can buy a whole pile with my local currency, and send it back to my mom in Costa Rica. She can convert it out, or not."
But, how does she convert it out?  Who does she go to to trade her BTC for local currency?  If nobody exists willing to make that trade (ie, a local merchant or investor), she's stuck with BTC that no merchants accept.
This type of system is also what gives stocks it's value.  The price of a share of MSFT is literally the last value a seller was able to find a buyer for.  Stock prices go down when nobody is willing to buy at that price.  Stock prices go up when numerous buyers are available and they get into a bidding war.

Yes, those jobs will be lost.  But, I see it as a good thing.  As these current employees move into another field, the availability of the new good or service they will produce will increase supply which will lead to a decrease in costs for everyone.
For example, what is driving the cost of bitcoin up?  It's the lack of supply along with the raise in demand.  If the protocol were to change to reward miners 1000 coins in lieu of 25 (along with raising the production cap to 210 million in lieu of 21 million), the price per coin would tank .  Similarly, if employees working in banking and other such sectors were to lose their job and rehired producing cars, milk, tires, gasoline, pharmaceuticals, electricity, etc, etc... the price of those commodities would tank.  That is an overall good thing as it would give everyone easier access to goods and services.

Gold is difficult to spend because it takes effort from a merchant to verify as genuine.  Gold is also difficult to store and transport safely.  It is for these reasons I believe the dollar became the superior form of currency.  But USD has slowly been eroded ever since the move off the gold standard.
Now we have a currency I believe is superior to gold and USD.  Merchants are increasingly accept it in trade for goods and services.  No merchant has reason to stop accepting the currency based on current performance.  This will eventually lead to significantly decreased tax revenues due to the inherent ease in tax dodging, new laws will be established, police crackdowns will start making the news, illegal stops, searches and seisures will increase, and we may even see a war(s).

I would disagree.  What stops the volatility of Gold?  Or Silver?  Or Sand?  What government agency controls those supplies?  Just so we're clear:
Value of Gold:  
Value of USD:  
The reason, I would argue, that the USD is so stable (despite always being in decline), is because of the large inertia behind it's use (the same with Gold and Silver).  So many business accept USD that the value is only affected by large scale economic activity, such as the housing bubble, and purposeful inflation.  If a Nation of significant size and significant GDP establishes laws such that businesses adopt CC in mass, then that becomes CC's backing, and the value of CC would stabilize.  


The same could be asked of Gold or Silver, but 50 years of history shows us how well USD has done vs. Gold.  Yes, I understand Gold and Silver have intrinsic value.  I would also argue that Bitcoin has intrinsic value (not nearly at the same scale of precious metals) because of it's utility as a currency.  I can safely store and transmit Bitcoin more easily than I can my USD.  My Bitcoin account cannot be frozen.

Every trend points upwards.
The price in USD is trending up for the year.
The number of unique wallet ids is trending up.
There are more news stories now than in previous years.
The number of new merchants, websites and apps that deal in btc is on the rise.
Anyone with half a brain that looks at this will realize it would take a catastrophic event to change the direction of these trends.  Btc to the moon in 2014

I like to look at market cap.  Market cap for a corporation is essentially the number of shares in circulation multiplied by the share price.  It forms the basis of the 'value' of a company. Currently, 
* DSW (a shoe company) has a market cap of $3B
* Twitter has a market cap of $50B
* Facebook has a market cap of $150B
* Apple has a market cap of $500B
* All the Gold in the world has a total value of $8.5 trillion
Which one of these do you think Bitcoin most resembles in value?  Also, today's market cap of bitcoin is $7.5B.
If it were to simply grow to the size of twitter, the price of a single coin would be roughly $5k.

I remember considering throwing $2000 at buying BTC in 2010.  The stockmarket had crashed just a few months prior, and I was eagerly looking for good investments.  Bitcoin caught my attention.  But, I didn't make a play (I got too scared).  My rational at that time was 'if this ever takes off, it doesn't matter if I was an early investor or not.... I may miss my chance at making millions, but I will still be so much better off without fiat currency that it really won't matter'.  I still believe this 3 years later.

Do you deny that there are ~7 Billion people in the world?
Also, do you deny this wikipedia statement that in 2008, there was $4T in USD of currency in circulation?
And do you know what the word average means?
From 2002, total world currency was $2 Trillion according to wikipedia.  In 6 years, it doubled to $4 trillion.  It is reasonable to assume that since 2008, it has close to doubled again to $8 Trillion.  
So, perhaps I'm off by a factor of 5.  But to my defense, there are also variables to take into consideration such as money markets.  When you have 10k stored in a money market, but simultaneously, another person is given access to that money to borrow against, how do you count it?

Ah.  I guess I always thought inflation was closely tied to printing money.  So, you may very well be technically correct, but my intention was to say that the BTC to USD exchange rate will grow independently of how quickly USD is printed.

I disagree with you.  While the bitcoin payment network is impressive, what drives the value is the willingness of merchants and investors to accept BTC in trade for goods and services.  If nobody wanted to trade their local currency for BTC, and if nobody would sell goods and services for BTC, it would have 0 value.

Thank you.  I got my answer.
There is cash forex and futures forex.  Both have different tax rules.  Basically, if you make money, you want to try to 'opt out' and claim it as futures forex, where you are charged a 60/40 split (60% at the 'long term' capital gain rate, 40% at short term capital gain rate).  If you lose money, you want to try to treat it like cash forex, where you claim it as interest lost (like a 1099 from the bank on your interest, only at a loss).

Silly question, but is anyone else this paranoid about having their private key taken?
I have a few cold storage setups for my private keys.  My private keys are not kept on my computer.  I keep the cold storage keys in few locations just in case one is ever lost/stolen/burned in a house fire.  But, the key I keep isn't the actual key.  I have systematically altered several characters.  By my calculations, if I alter 5 characters, a thief would have to first know how many characters I changed.  If they were lucky and were to guess 5, then there would be 51 x 50 x 49 x 48 x 47 * 60^5 possible combinations of possible changes before the private key is captured, or roughly 2.2E17.  My hope is that if a thief were to obtain my key, they wouldn't even consider that a few  characters had been altered.  But even if they did, the time it would take to brute force attack the number of possible combinations would give me time to recover one of the cold keys and move my coins.

Challenge accepted.
World population is 7 Billion.  
Wild assumption, but I'm going to suggest that the average individual is in possession of $5,000 USD at any period in time.  I say that, because it would put worldwide total currency value today at $35T USD.  For comparison, US does about $16T gross domestic product.  Someone can challenge me on this number, but I think its a good start.
So, it follows that $35T / 21M (BTC) = 1.6M $ / BTC, $1,600 = 1mBTC.  Keep in mind this is dependent on worldwide acceptable, and could vary greatly given the number of 'lost' coins in the system and other factors .

My ray of hope is that all it will take is for one nation to embrace it.  Imagine if Switzerland, an international banking powerhouse, chose to publicly support cryptocurrencies by allowing it's banks to set up BTC exchanges.  From there, nations would have to block all banking with Switzerland to stop Bitcoin.  I don't see that happening.  And I don't see Switzerland basking in all of that influx of wealth without other Nations seeing the benefit, being jealous, and then relaxing their laws.  I really believe it would take an international nation wide ban on all cryptocurrencies to stop this movement, and ye old prisoner's dilemma doesn't allow for it.

Maybe someone can change my mind, but I really dislike the idea of any online wallet.  The strength behind bitcoins security is in the size of the public and private keys.  If you store these keys in an online account behind a much smaller username/password combination, you've effectively defeated bitcoins security in exchange for having easier access to your money.

I personally don't believe Bitcoin *currency* has any intrinsic value.  Bitcoin is just a number on a ledger.  Prior to the invention of Bitcoin, we all had access to excel, and nobody valued owning a ledger of virtual currency transactions.  By contrast, people have always valued wood, cotton, water, gold, gems, food, etc.
However, the Bitcoin *protocol* does have a sort of intrinsic value.  Since the invention of currency, man has valued ways in which to store and transport it.  This has spawned the invention of the vault, the bank, the money wire and the armored truck.  The Bitcoin protocol serves as a better vault, a better wire, and a better armored truck.  For me, that is where the intrinsic value lies.

I'm still missing something.  If the system depends on your pass-phrase for access, then all the regenerating of public/private keys becomes a series of smoke and mirrors.  All a malicious user needs is your pass-phrase, and they can gain access to your wallet.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:53:00
Lets get some things straight.  Rumors, news, DDOS attacks, high sell/buy volume and lawsuits do effect the short term value of BTC.  But unless you are the 1 in a million sitting at the wheel, you cannot predict when the next DDOS attack, lawsuit, high sell/buy transaction or rumor will hit the market.  Anyone trying to buy/sell based on these predictions is gambling with their money.  
What I would much rather see discussed is BTC GDP and other sound financial metrics.  These are the types of things that define the true value of BTC and give insight as to weather the exchange rate is currently over valued or under valued.

Again, an online exchange willing to convert it out is essentially a merchant that is willing to change it out.  Every computer system is backed by a person or persons running it.  An exchange, by definition, requires the cooperation of more than 1 person.

That I agree with.  I'm not talking in terms of what is possible now, I'm talking about what is possible within 10 years.  If we hit a critical tipping point where nobody wants fiat currency, and there is a mass exodus into crypto currencies, then we will see a major explosion in bitcoin value.

Let's say cryptocurrencies have become essentially banned in 90% of countries.    Now let's say Switzerland allows for virtually unregulated cryptocurrency trade.  It now becomes attractive for people to funnel their money into Switzerland in order to gain easy access to CC.  Most governments would try to regulate having money taken out of the country, but having money move into the country is very very attractive.
Also, to the redditor below that says this is not a prisoner's delimma, I see it like this:
| x   | Country A  Allows CC | Country A Bans CC    |
| Country B Allows CC  |   CC takes over Fiat     |  Country B Sees inflow of Cash, Country A sees Outflow of Cash   
| Country B Bans CC       |        Country A Sees inflow of Cash, Country B sees Outflow of Cash |    Country A and B maintain Fiat Status Quo
In other words, Countries A and B both have to disallow CC in order to maintain control.  However, there is an incentive to be the world's monopoly in CC trade.  Thus, countries move to accept CC in which case CC overtakes fiat.

BTC is superior to the USD in that USD is printed by the government in mass.  My $10 USD today won't be worth $10 USD tomorrow.  It will be worth less as more dollars are put in circulation.  Btc is better for me as a customer and as a merchant.  I would rather hold gold than USD except for the issues previously discussed.
The only reason for USD to retain value will be due to military.  But I question the power of a currency that's only advantage is for destruction and not construction.  I don't know how that will play out.  I do know the government will hate it.

Bitcoin can be transmitted anywhere without the need for expensive 3rd party wiring services such as PayPal or Western Union.  If you have ever been screwed over by one of these services, or if you simply dislike paying expensive currency exchange fees while traveling, Bitcoin is right for you.  It is difficult to counterfeit, it is not burdened by inflation (think owning gold), and it can revolutionize both the world economy and all the banking systems.

@_date: 2013-12-17 19:59:22
What I believe is important that always gets missed is this:
The price of stock or Bitcoin is literally the last price in which a seller could find a buyer for.  
So, if everyone holds, and a storm of people come in who want to buy, the price of a Bitcoin or Stock will rise as people bid higher and higher prices to get what they want.
If everyone is selling, and there are no buyers, then those who are trying to sell will slowly lower their price until they can get out of the market.  
This is what supply and demand looks like.  This is what caused home prices to crash in 2009.  This is what drives the stock market, bubbles, pops of bubbles, long term gains and long term losses.  
OP is right in that someone is most likely doing a penny stock promo to sucker in young investors.

Here is something I hadn't considered before yesterday.  The value of Bitcoin is undeniably rising.  And as it grows in use, it will grow in demand, and thus it will grow in value.  That's just basic economics.
However, on the reverse side of things, the Dollar, the Euro and all the other major world currencies will lose demand.  Who will be left that will want to accept these currencies for goods and services?  Who will want to hold these currencies in their savings account?  And as demand for these currencies fall, and as they become difficult to sell, the value of a single bitcoin will explode.
