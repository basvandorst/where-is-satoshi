I did not remember that that was the email I had signed up for bitstamp with. The actual problem is that they did something to the account which prohibits me from login in and checking the support ticket.

I managed to renew it now, and ofcourse, since today seems to be filled with bad luck for me, I encountered some kind of error so it's not yet showing up in my account, I'm sure it will soon though, and then I'll setup the email again and hopefully everything will work with bitstamp.
I'll come back here if it doesn't. Thank you all for your help and sorry for wasting your time.

Noone else has bought the domain, I just didn't renew it, I even looked up the who-is for the domain. So that is not the case.

I did look up renewing the domain. And, I can't. The provider I previously had it at says it's unavailable. I'll contact them and ask what's up, because it was available (for like 4 times the price) on another provider. 
I only have about 0,5 bitcoin on that bitstamp account, so renewing the domain is a pretty big percentage of that money. 
I'm really sorry if you feel like I'm wasting your time. It was just the fact that I can't login anymore that made this whole thing very confusing for me. I was expecting their support to ask me for some kind of proof that I am the owner of the account (ID or something) and then change it for me, not make the account inacessible.

I sent an email to that adress too, thank you.

That will force me to pay (for a full year), for a domain I don't want or need anymore. I know it's not much but I'd rather try to solve it another way first.
