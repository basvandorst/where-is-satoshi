So the FDA has no power over drugs made in state and only sold in state? They certainly pretend to. 
@_date: 2016-04-25 15:17:02
Its good to see you've conceded your original argument so thoroughly, you forgot you made it. 
Just to remind you, YOU are the one who implied the FDA was necessary to stop people from putting rat poison in what we consume:

Banks have been one of the most regulated industries in the 20th and 21st century and yet we have had far more devastating financial crashes than we ever had in the 19th century when regulation was far less. 


Did you even bother reading after the UL example? There were many more after that. Pretending evidence you don't like doesn't exist is a pretty piss poor excuse at rational thought.

Not sure where in the constitution it gives the feds the power to decide what people can and can't put in their bodies. 
@_date: 2016-04-23 14:36:05


Does this fear justify authoritarianism over somebodies control over their body? Why isn't it bad for you to advocate the violent pressure of the state to control what people can or can't do with their bodies. How is that better than the social non violent pressure people MIGHT put on other people. Finally if this is truly an ethical concern(you have yet to show why), can't we set up measures to ensure people aren't pressured while also not violently dictating what they can and can't do with their body? 


You have not shown how this is morally wrong. Even if it is, how does this fear justify authoritarianism over people choices with THEIR OWN BODY. You keep avoiding this question. When you advocate preventing something with the violence of the State, you have to justify it. 


This is not an argument. You can't just attach "treating humans as guinea pigs" to something and think you have refuted it. 


How does this pure speculation justify authoritarianism over peoples' choices with THEIR OWN BODY. Stop throwing out speculative fears and hoping it saves you from having to justify your position. How is violently preventing people from controlling their own bodies justified?

Homeopathic remedies aren't regulated by the FDA. Guess how many of them have rat poison? You don't need the FDA to stop people from putting rat poison in their bodies. That kind of thing takes care of itself. 
What the FDA does do, is keep life saving drugs out of the hands of people who need them, leading to the deaths of tens of thousands.

Same Strawman. this will be the last time I point it out.


Same ad hominen. This will be the last time I point it out. 


Exactly!!!!! So you have admitted that your original point that the FDA is necessary to keep rat poison out of what we consume is invalid. There is no reason to keep this discussion going. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 14:32:48
Why must you have any form of FDA at all? Private regulatory bodies are much more efficient, effective and accountable. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 23:48:24


Nice Strawman.


Nice Ad hominem.


Nice deflection: Now how about you address the argument. Homeopathic remedies are not regulated by the FDA and yet they don't contain rat poison. Therefore you don't need the FDA to keep rat poison out of things we put in our body. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 13:43:25


Sorry. I didn't see your question before. I've linked to this elsewhere, but [page 12]( of this report has a bunch of good examples.
@_date: 2016-04-22 00:02:54
Couldn't agree more. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 00:06:22
Private regulation not only works but is more efficient than public, not to mention it doesn't require the violence of the state to enforce. See page [12]( of this report for many examples of long lasting, trusted private regulatory bodies. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 00:02:25


This isn't a question of whether the FDA ensures that products are safe for consumption. This is a question about our freedom to put whatever we want in our bodies and assume the risk involved. The FDA uses the violence of the State to keep us from doing so. This has terrible consequences including the death of tens of thousands of people who are denied access to life saving drugs that have been approved in Europe. Further, you need to make an argument that the FDA is necessary to keep what we consume safe. Homeopathic remedies are not regulated by the FDA and yet people are not harmed by them. 


Page [12]( of this report has a bunch of examples.


There is a key difference. Private regulatory bodies can't keep you from deciding what goes in your body. Also without the FDA there would be actual competition incentivizing regulatory bodies to be efficient, effective, and cheap. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 23:52:20


Does your fear that companies will take advantage of desperate people justify keeping potentially life saving drugs out of the hands of people who are willing to try them? What gives you the right to dictate what they do with their bodies? Your viewpoint is authoritarian. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 13:48:50


Don't deflect. I'm not dismissing the ethical concerns you brought up. However, do those fears justify keeping potentially life saving drugs out of the hands of people who are willing to try them? What gives you the right to dictate what they do with their bodies? That's what it means to advocate for a government regulatory body like the FDA. You are denying people their right to choose what happens to their bodies. This is authoritarian. You can't just say "ethics" and be done. You need to actually justify the authoritarian component of your viewpoint.

Do you happen to have a screencap of it before it was edited?  Was it one of the Nano's?  I didn't see it in either of the links.  
I understand deleting your comment in r/CyptoCurrency but this is blowing up everywhere.  If you feel you're in the right, people should hear your side of things.  Ignoring the problem will just let it fester and get worse. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:09:39
Honestly I regret posting this.  All I've gotten from poking my nose into these crypto subs is confusing contradictory information, defensiveness, and hostility.  
I'm not blaming you but I can't say your comment has enlightened me about anything.  Both sides seem to jump down the throat of anybody questioning them (yes I think r/btc is just as bad).  
**Edit:** Sorry just looked at your link.  I believe you.  I'm just demoralized at the level of conversation on reddit.  I know I know, I should know better.  I'm a naive soul. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:36:56


As far as I can tell yes.  Thank you so much!  Not only do I feel you addressed his criticisms but I also think I understand LN alot more.  I've been watching videos but things weren't clicking.  Still not completely clicking.  I'm trying to understand how it solves the double payment problem more but I'll figure it out. 
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:30:44
Care to elaborate? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:38:10
Thank you for the response!  Your points make sense though I don't think I quite understand the risk of centralization.  Is it just that bigger blocks require more computing/processing from nodes?  Why is that called centralization? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 15:19:50
Thank you for your responses.  I do appreciate the input despite the fact I will push back on it below.






That still doesn't make it a "cheat".  Granted I'm not a fan of patents period and wish they didn't exist.  But that's not the system were in and plenty of people think the patent system helps innovation (again I don't).
Your next points boil down to being against centralization and against the character of Jihan.  I don't care about either.  
**Centralization** is only bad if the government is doing it.  When it happens in the free market, it is only sustainable if it leads to better products and services.  
I don't care about the **character** of the people behind my products and services.  I don't like Bezos or Sundar Pichai but I still use Amazon and Google.  That's the point of a free market.  It doesn't depend on the virtue in people.  Bad actors with greedy intentions have to still provide a product or service people value.
In that light, I'm only looking for the differences related to value and utility between BTC and BCH.  You say BCH provides nothing.  This is simply not true.  It provides lower fees.  You can argue the reasons behind that(and others have made convincing arguments in this thread about that) but dismissing its existence is not going to convince people who can clearly see 2+2=4. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:20:45
Thank you for your time and responses but I'm not looking for why you think the people behind BCH have ill intentions.  I want to know if the criticisms of LN brought up in the video are legitimate or not. 
Dismissing them for unrelated reasons just makes me question your own intentions.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:44:06
Thank you for taking the time to watch and respond.  I'm very curious if the problems he brings up are legitimate.  Will LN require online persistence?  Will it require expensive development for businesses?  
Part of the problem is I still don't quite understand how LN works and why second layer solutions are preferable to scaling on chain transactions. 
Any answers are greatly appreciated. :) 
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:32:44

@_date: 2018-02-04 02:13:26
I have equal amounts BTC and BCH because I'm just not sure which has the right solution going forward. Looking for thoughtful responses on this video. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:24:59


Not an argument. 


Not an argument.


If government is not involved than there's nothing wrong with either monopolies or banks. 


Not an argument. 


You did say that.  Here's the full context:


And my answer is the same: relative to Bitcoin, BCH has lower fees.


@_date: 2018-02-04 06:07:36
Not sure I see the problem then.  How is AsicBoost a cheat if anybody can use it(after paying the fee)?  Why does Antbleed and AsicBoost mean anything with respect to the value and utility of BCH? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:01:21


How do you know the guy in the video is suspect?  Are his criticisms of LN legitimate regardless of his intentions?  
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:49:00
Makes sense.  Thanks for all the clear and informative responses :)
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:54:02
Thanks for the response.  McCafee seems to have a high opinion of Jihan.  He says centralization of mining is inevitable.  I don't understand this AsicBoost and Antbleed enough to know if they are nefarious.  If they are cheats or backdoors wouldn't that mean there's a rather large vulnerability in bitcoin?  Segwit isn't widely adopted yet correct?  So if these are vulnerabilities isn't that a huge cause for concern?   
@_date: 2017-07-18 15:04:59


Not surprising.  Lower IQs have trouble making arguments and staying engaged in anything for very long.  They'd rather just count on their "common sense" than deal with the hard work of actually coming up with an argument.
