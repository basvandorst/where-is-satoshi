There is a difference between PRIVATE and PERSONAL property.
Yes, taxes are theft.
No my computer is not stolen or made from scratch.
In Marxian economics and socialist politics, there is distinction between "private property" and "personal property". The former is defined as the means of production in reference to private ownership over an economic enterprise based on socialized production and wage labor; the latter is defined as consumer goods or goods produced by an individual. Prior to the 18th century, private property usually referred to land ownership. When Marx called for the abolition of private property, he was not referring to privately owned personal property such as clothing and furniture that was not used to produce the "social wealth," but to productive property.
I do not fully support everything Marx said but I like his critic of the capitalist system and the idea of Capital

As an anarchist (not ancap I hate capitalism and think property is theft) nationalism has existed well before and will sadly exist well after bitcoin. I mean the internet and the ability to communicate with other nations and not rely on the racist propaganda the state media has told you about other nationalities should have ended this, but technology is a two edged sword and thus has allowed more nationalistic communities to exists. Chimpout and Stormfront come to mind. Bitcoin will still have people thinking their place of better is better then others. Bitcoin will not teach empathy in humans.

The pipes can only move so much at a time, and the only way to ration it is to charge for it, that's the same reason we have transaction fees.
Correct thats why you pay more for a faster connection. The pipe is rationed by how much you use at a time not how much you use over time.
The costs of running and already set up network are minimal.
It would be the same as trying to charge for playing a game more then once. Information wants to be free.

Both the left and the right benefit from freedom. And its more of an centralization vs decentralization question as oppose to collectivism vs individualism. Open source movements are inherently left wing to some world views take a look at wikipedia and linux they are deemed communistic implemantations but they still work and lead to a freer market and more liberty. The world is not black and white or left vs right.
While you may want a right wing leader that is tough on crime and easy on taxes while spending  lots on defence and immigration.
Maybe compare what the actual parties do in the local regions.
The pirate party supports competition as a way of getting better internet and not central planning at all.
While the green party has strong views to limit patent laws to 14 years to support freedom to innovate.

    Instant on: Your client does not download the blockchain. It uses a network of specialized servers that index the blockchain.
    Forgiving: Your wallet can be recovered from a secret seed.
    Safe: Your seed and private keys are encrypted on your hard drive. They are never sent to the servers.
    Low trust: Information received from the servers is verified using SPV. Servers are authenticated using SSL
    No downtimes: Your client is not tied to a particular server; it will switch instantly if your server is down.
    Ubiquitous: You can use the same wallet on different computers, they will synchronize automatically.
    Cold Storage: Sign transactions from a computer that is always offline. Broadcast them using a machine that does not have your keys.
    Reachable: You can export your private keys into other Bitcoin clients.
    Established: Electrum is open source and was first released in November 2011.

Anarchist communists counter the capitalist conception that communal property can only be maintained by force and that such a position is neither fixed in nature[114] nor unchangeable in practice, citing numerous examples of communal behavior occurring naturally even within capitalist systems.[115] Anarchist communists call for the abolition of private property while maintaining respect for personal property. As such the prominent anarcho-communist Alexander Berkman maintained that "The revolution abolishes private ownership of the means of production and distribution, and with it goes capitalistic business. Personal possession remains only in the things you use. Thus, your watch is your own, but the watch factory belongs to the people. Land, machinery, and all other public utilities will be collective property, neither to be bought nor sold. Actual use will be considered the only title-not to ownership but to possession. The organization of the coal miners, for example, will be in charge of the coal mines, not as owners but as the operating agency. Similarly will the railroad brotherhoods run the railroads, and so on. Collective possession, cooperatively managed in the interests of the community, will take the place of personal ownership privately conducted for profit."

They would use Direct Democracy not the current flawed representative democrazy,
Anarchist communists reject the claim that wage labor is necessary because people are by "nature" lazy and selfish. They point out that even the so-called "idle rich" sometimes find useful things to do despite having all their needs satisfied by the labour of others. 
Anarcho-communists generally do not agree with the belief in a pre-set 'human nature', arguing that human culture and behavior is very largely determined by socialization. 
Many, like Peter Kropotkin, also believe that human evolutionary tendency is for humans to cooperate with each other for mutual benefit and survival instead of existing as lone competitors.

Freenet is a peer-to-peer platform for censorship-resistant communication. It uses a decentralized distributed data store to keep and deliver information, and has a suite of free software for publishing and communicating on the Web without fear of censorship. Both Freenet and some of its associated tools were originally designed by Ian Clarke, who defined Freenet's goal as providing freedom of speech on the Internet with strong anonymity protection.

Because bandwidth doesn’t cost anything. Using 10meg a month or 200gb is the same cost to the company. The only real costs is making sure my speeds are kept up. When everyone in the local area uses 200gb a month then we usually suffer from a slower connection. Thats why companies charge.
Also as I host a tor node I use about 1TB a month on a 50/30 mbits connection.

Programmers generally know CS(computer science) and pick up bitcoin relatively easily, and the questions they have are not the same as a target consumer.
Banks are quite knowledgeable about financial information and also will be able to wrap their heads around the blockchain with ease.
What you are doing is swell but I think already established sites like weusecoins.com take the cake here.

With change tip most people don't hold over 25 dollar in there at a time, so even if the developers turned evil, or started banning certain users for tipping "illegal" content its not as bad as an exchange or web wallet.
Still the proper solution is to post a public key on all the content you host and upload. Like that anyone who sees you work will see the bitcoin. Not just those that see the small tipping message.

Because bitcoin is open source people decided to make their own coin with certain tweaks usually transaction confirmation time and the maximum amount of blocks. They are called altcoins and most developers of them hope to get rich if they get adopted as they have a early lead on the mining kinda like satoshi and the 2010/11 investors do with bitcoin.

My politcal view are that of an anarchocommunist.
in anarcho-communist theory, land used by individuals for themselves or their families, or productive property used to produce for an individual (such as a small farm), would be considered private possessions (personal property) rather than social possessions. The individual would be perfectly free to create something and keep it as long as it is not a crucial means of production for the community or general public. So an artist's paintbrushes would not need outside approval to be utilized, and the same basic principle would apply to other personal items such as one's toothbrush, musical instruments or book collection, which others needn't tamper with. However, if the matter at hand involves production for society (such as a factory which makes toothbrushes, musical instruments or books), it would become a social possession, accountable to all who work within it and the consuming public. In that regard, anarcho-communism could be considered a compromise between collective and individual use.
PERSONAL and PRIVATE are two different types of property.
No learn to make a proper argument instead of attempting shitty straw men theories.

The NSA already know what email you used to sign up on the exchanges, Its not hard to match up the transaction to your online account even if the email was GPGd. If you are wanting to be anonymous with your bitcoin you would not use an online exchange at all, try localbitcoins or bitcoin-OTC on freenode
