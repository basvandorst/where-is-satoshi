Gosh so much stupidtalk here "Rasp PI 60 bucks bleghr!!!1" yadda yadda. Wish you guys would get your head out of your ass about the RPi2 for 400 bucks really
=&gt; 1) It's a devkit ie for devs to explore 21's tech platform before its released to public
=&gt; 2) What is 21's tech platform? =&gt; They've API'ed Bitcoin
=&gt; 3) How? 
a) Miner chip distributes tiny amounts of Bitcoin to everyone hacking the legal system and KYC requirements (no KYC for mining, only for exchanges...) -&gt; you may want to read Princeton Bitcoin Coursr: [A cash-based system needs to be “bootstrapped” with some initial allocation of cash, without which no trades can occur]( 
b) Efficient ASIC based pooled mining including search algo that splits the hash into two pieces. [according to 21's patent filing]( 
c) A cloud stack that co-ordinates between the nodes in the mining pool 
d) A hardware wallet to receive Bitcoins 
e) Microtransaction server and other middleware that co-ordinates between the metal and the cloud
=&gt; 4) What's it used for? 
-&gt; Just imagine that in 18 months there will be 50 million 21tech devices in the world. It's like a new sensor getting added to a smartphone. What can you imagine doing with it as a developer? 
-&gt; Now you can buy the Bitcoin Computer and have a chance to build apps on the platform before it gets out to the public.
=&gt; Stupid critiscm no 1: No way they will get it distributed wide enough to make a difference, not at 400 bucks a pop yadda yadda 
-&gt; [Intel, Qualcomm, Cisco will put in the 21 chip into devices for free....]( 
-&gt; The ASIC chip is free.... [Mining capability embedded directly in chipsets, Zero Opex, Zero Capex](
=&gt; Stupid criticsm no 2: RPi2 65 bucks 21 bitcomp 400 cry gasp sob -&gt; RPi2/128GBSD - Design decision due to the fact that 21 wanted to keep a consistent development environment for the devkit. They want you to code using the sandboxed hardware and software they've built so that they can figure shit out if stuff goes wrong in devkit. From Balaji's Coursera course: [it is not completely trivial to set up a working environment in which to write, edit, and debug code.](  
-&gt; 400 bucks... I'm iffy about this, but my guess is that they decided to price it high in order to show some revenue and reduce the amount of capital they have to raise. They also decided that the people who were going to buy this are likely devs who understand what they're paying for, not the amateur miners (are you making money off your AntMiner you fools...).
=&gt; REAL FUTURE COST OF 21tech = USD 0. -&gt; Will come as embedded ASIC or built directly into Qualcomm/Intel chipset.
=&gt; WAR, huh yeah... WHAT IS IT GOOD FOR? 
-&gt; A Kindle you can read every book ever printed for free with no subscription, no account, no passwords!!! How? (Device with 21 chip plus Oyster like subscription, as long as device has power can mine enough to pay for subscription) 
-&gt; A TV you can watch every movie and TV series ever made for free!! How? ( TV with 21 chip plus Netflix, ditto) 
-&gt; Free passwordless Wifi anywhere you go on your phone, if you allow your home wifi to participate as a Free Wifi Access Node (Home wifi gets paid by other users to 21 hardware wallet plus has mining chip, transfer bitcoins to phone to pay for wifi service, authentication uses transfer of satoshis to Wifi node instead of putting in a password)
=&gt; If in case you were wondering what 130 million bucks and 30 stanford/MIT/CMU EECS PHDs buys you -&gt; It buys you the mofoing full stack baby from the sand on the beach all the way to the 21 Bitcoin computer sitting on your desk
