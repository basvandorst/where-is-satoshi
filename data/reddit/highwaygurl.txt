Oh fuck you. You're such a fucking troll. I'm blocking you so respond all you like. But fuck you're a real shithead. And you may not know that or understand that, but you're talking on the fucking internet and everybody else can see right through your bullshit.

Maybe we could all stop using that word? I'm trans and I'm also a member of this community and seeing things like that makes me think this is not a very safe place to be. You could just say trans and get your point across without being mean.

You know the word tranny is a pretty mean word right?

One of those trans folk chiming in... I thought ~~your~~ **** comment was great. Funny and not at all transphobic.

Your post is extremely condescending. It's pretty rich of you to tell me what my experience is and to decide that I - the person who challenged a hateful term's use - am somehow being hateful. I was pretty nice about the whole thing. 
Also, just because a word is being reclaimed doesn't take away its initial offense. I'm a pretty active member of the trans community across a few generations of people, and this is the first time I've seen anybody try to express that tranny is being reclaimed (I grant you that like most slurs, overtime, younger and younger people often reclaim them. But if it is presently being reclaimed, it is a very very tiny minority of people who are reclaiming it. And given that you initially thought tranny was related to transvestites, I really don't think you are standing on solid ground here). Maybe someday it will be mainstream and reclaimed, but for you to choose the third definition - the least used definition for the term - and to ignore the first two definitions which clearly express its hatefulness and harm, is, well, disingenuous: you're just cherry-picking something to help support your wrong claim. You can't just pick and choose. 
Also, I'm guessing you're not a part of this community at all, and as much as we welcome people in our community, like any in-group, somebody from the out-group doesn't get to just come in and start telling people how they are. 
And you can also stop waving around your own problems, because none of this is about you. 
You had an opportunity to learn something about a community that you are not a part of, and instead of learning something and accepting you are wrong, and even perhaps extending an apology, you dug your heels in and have just made it all worse.

I'm sorry, but you're just completely wrong. Why don't you just Google it and go do some learning. One, it is not related to transvestites, and two, it is in no fucking way affectionate. It's a mean fucking slur.

Err, sort of. Sorry. I think I conflated 2 ideas as I wrote it. I began by supporting what you are saying, but I then attributed the original comment to you. Sorry! And yes, I don't think your comment is transphobic. But thanks for being so aware!
