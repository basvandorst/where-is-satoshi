1) Buy bitcoin using Yuan
2) Send bitcoin to Mt.Gox
3) Sell bitcoin for USD (or any other currencies that is not Yuan) and deposit to a foreign account
Many Chinese or their relatives have foreign bank account.

Ah I see. Then that IS Carvirtex' fault then. At first I just thought market was frozen purely because the asking price is much higher than bidding price.

VirtEx is having huge backlog of buyers who cannot get in. I heard people who applied files earlier this month, and still waiting for verification... Seeing the price going from 200ish to 900ish must be a torture...
I do expect that VirtEx price will rise a lot soon though, once all the Canadians with cash come in.

This could be verified by the front page of  "银行汇款充值24小时到账，支持招商、建设银行。", which means "You can use the remittance to deposit fiat into our platform. The fund will be available in 24 hours. We support China Merchants Bank and China Construction Bank".
Maybe BTCChina and OKCoin will follow it.
