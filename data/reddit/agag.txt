mine took more than 24h, 3 days ago. Usually they are in my intersango account couple of hours after i have made the transfer.

thank you  :)

Is there a substantial fixed fee for such payments? Is a SEPA the same as a transfer using IBAN/SWIFT codes?

This is so hyped.

Good to hear. You have to agree though that it doesn't inspire much confidence for a company who wants people to invest  in it  to not having a DNS entry setup. :) 
@_date: 2012-05-20 23:31:07
in any case i think is quite entertaining. :)

This is a very interesting topic that I was always wanted to bring up for discussion here but never did. I was always curious to ask people how something like  [this](  would apply in bitcoin.

it doens't work with p2pool. Althought the have said they will fix this in a later release of their bitstream . Relying on their bitstreams is annoying but I guess not much to do about this.

There was a site there a week ago and suddenly vaporized.

what would be really useful in greece would be an bitcoin exchange. Is there one?

MMM is still running ?I though the guy got busted a while ago?
@_date: 2012-08-16 13:02:55
I did and I dumped them as fast as I could...

I paid £25 for such a transaction from a UK bank to a greek bank. The fee was taken by the uk bank. It was fixed for any amount of money I wanted to transfer.
That was 2  years ago though...

I saw it first here and I found it a very interesting read!

Thank you OP.
