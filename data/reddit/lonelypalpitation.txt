Does moving my Bitcoin from Coinbase and Mycelium to my trezor count as adopting Segwit?

Its a fucked up system. I'm still a young research scientist so I've yet to publish much (or big), however, I do upload my work  to places like Researchgate (Its like Facebook, but, for scientists). Once I've uploaded my work to Researchgate, anyone who has a research gate account can simply come and download the article. 
Furthermore, if you can't access an article due to the paywall, you can email the corresponding author and ask for a copy of said article (and the vast majority of the time, they are compliant with your request). 
Make no mistake, scientist aren't stupid. We want to share our work, but, there's no systematic way in which we can do so (few open-source journals are available). Furthermore, the system is built in such a way that we are incentivized to publish in these high-impact journals in order to keep the lab afloat (again, via grants from the government). 
Sci-hub is amazing because it breaks a hole in the model. Publishers essentially double-dip, charging both the researcher and the reader. Sci-hub alleviates the cost of reading.

If you don't get grants, you can't do research, you can't publish. If you can't publish, you don't get grants, you can't do research. If you can't do research, you can't publish, you can't get grants. 
Understand the following: if you live in a country that's not a fucked Banana Republic, nearly all research is paid by your government. The results of the research are published by a journal. The journal then restricts access to the public (paywall). The scientist must pay to publish and receive no money for publication, it is merely a line on their CV which they leverage to get more money from the government. Ultimately, it is not researchers that are being robbed. It is the public. You have a broke and corrupt middleman.
The landscape is only starting to change with the introduction of PLOS and eLife. Its not theft. Its my tax dollars. I'm entitled to see to what use my tax $ are being used for.

Your blogging ain't science. Not publishing your work in academic journal typically excludes it from the rigour and critique of your intellectual peers.
Don't pretend to be a scientist. Don't tell people we don't need money to run a laboratory (or that I can't take money to pay myself). Your blog is merely mental masturbation. You don't do anything empirical. At best, your blog/podcasts are metaphysical. At worst, its straight pseudoscience.

its hard. science is strapped for money. you need to publish well and you need to publish high. 
its a complex problem but you can't ask the scientist to make the sacrifice; that will grind the research institution to a stop.

*It doesn't matter where you publish, or how much money you get funded for.*
That's a naive approach. Don't take this the wrong way, but, its clear you've never worked in a biomedical laboratory. 
For those of you who are not familiar, let's consider the cost of running a simple experiment. We want to know if two proteins interact in a cell, so we do something call a co-immunoprecipitation. This involves affinity purifying a protein of interest from cell lysate, via an antibody column, and running a semi-quantitative technique called a Western blot to check if your protein of interest has been co-purified (suggestive of binding).
What's the cost of this?:
One time costs:
Human Tissue Culture cells: ~$500 
Incubator: ~$500-$2000
Biosafety Cabinet: ~$10000-$50000 (potentially more) 
Recurring Costs (every couple of months or less, depends on how often to use):
Growth Media: ~$5-$30
Specialized Growth Media: ~$50-$100
Fetal/Calf Bovine Serum: ~$200-$400
Tissue Culture Plates: ~$100
Buffers: ~$30-$50
 
RIPA Buffer: ~$50
IP Antibody: ~$150-$500
WB Antibody:~$100-$400
SDS-Gel Running System + Western Blot [one time cost]: ~$250-$500
A lab has many scientist, asking many questions. It cost money. Don't be ignorant. Science is also an underpaid field. I get paid below the poverty line to do research. I only put up with it because I love it.

Prove to me your productivity. Show me your open-access publications.
