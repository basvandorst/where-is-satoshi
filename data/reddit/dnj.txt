Do you understand why companies don't take the Zimbabwe dollar for online purchases?  The volatility is too great to place an actual value on it.
Enter bitcoin.. and the reason why it won't be used for purchases until the value settles.  (And, most likely, once the value settles, I'd imagine huge swaths of the HODL'ers will jump ship.)

Good to know.
Here's some advice though - typically, it is not a good idea to brag about tax evasion on forums that can be gathered by government entities.
Since you're openly talking about hiding your holdings from your bank account, I'm imagining there's SOME kind of law or tax regulation in place that you're avoiding.  If I were you, I'd delete this shit.

Reasonable doesn't mean accurate.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:56:26
Shitty tip.
Just give cash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:57:00
Yeah, people are prepping for the larger drop coming in like an hour
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:08:26
I'm sure what stops them are all those super smart and totally good looking people that are "HODL"ing bitcoin right now, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:44:21
Look, i don't want him shitting his pants, so I'm not going to mention 5-6k or lower.

I'm pretty sure you need to be 18 to legally create your own in the US (most likely.)  So, you'll probably need to wait a few years, kiddo.
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:50:22
Oh, so you're 12.  My bad, little guy.
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:32:32
51% likely.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:00:46
Eh, unlikely they could use that deduction.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:46:12
The fuck you talkin bout boy?

But what about the day *after* the day after tomorrow?
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:43:28
Perhaps move to a paper wallet?

Satoshi revealed to not exist.  Bitcoin created by a programmer that was paid to do so by Trump.  All Satoshi's coins are held by Trump companies and trusts.

"This is a protocol"
As someone who actually knows what a protocol is, what the fuck are you talking about?

I mean fuck, I've never heard of someone getting their iphone stolen.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:42:37
Uh... you don't.
If you really want to day-trade, try fucking around with the pink sheets.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:23:30
Well that doesn't sound very lucrative.

Nice, another reddit account created just to pump your investment of the day.  Good luck!

There used to be fees for using credit (or debit) cards.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:21:09
This explains it fairly well:

Maybe you shouldn't try to spend more money than you actually have in your account.
Bitcoins won't let you overdraft, you know.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:58:57
price would probably drop by a not-insignificant amount.

As a consolation, because of the lower fee, your bitcoin will "love you long time," so at least you've got that going for you.
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:03:28
We have basically zero storefronts (brick and mortar or online) that take bitcoin.  Use it... how?
