Yah but miners are people with wallets who can make transactions with the Bitcoin they are given as fees. Bitcoin is never destroyed (unless you lose your private key).

Won't this eventually but good for gaming. Miners are providing a huge amount of revenue for card makers. This way hopefully they will invest and improve the technology

They banned the usage of Bitcoin in China

Hey, thanks for accepting Bitcoin ND further legitimizing it as a form of currency!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:24:10
ahhh ohkay, thank you.  How come they don't just have their share be worth 1 BTC?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:42:51
I mean paper and digital are kid on your only options.  You could try to hide the key in some other sort of document.  Perhaps disguise it as a receipt, some sort of product ID, or a password for some other account. That way when someone looks at it, they will not realize that its BTC related.

Nice! Great work!
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:15:40
its a good think regardless, and I am happy about it.  I just feel like the titles (like this: [One of the world’s largest financial services firms is mining bitcoins](  are a little misleading.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:27:59
Could you explain what you are talking about? What cartel of miners? How are they sabotaging bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:53:07
is it limited to 8? Right now .1$ is 4x10^-5. If the valuation keeps going up like people are claiming it will, it might be necessary to have more decimal places. That would mean it would have to increase by three orders of magnitude! To^the^moon^we^go

Everyone here has their own opinions and speculations.  Investing is investing.  If we could predict the future with 100% confidence, we would be rich.  Do your research on the industry and the projects.  Then make your own decisions on investment.

and they mined a grant total of .002 BTC....what a commitment to the blockchain
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:44:19
I'm sorry, I'm not a huge investment person.  Could you explain the math that you did in the title?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:13:36
So if the price of BTC continues to go up, do you think that they will halve?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:15:53
There are also other exchanges like Gemini
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:50:39
sorry.  I mean there really is no way to check.  Its only 34 characters.  Just go one by one.  Check it thrice, ask your bud to check it twice, check it again the next day, and shazam, you probably copied it right. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:14:39
This is true, but I feel like it's just a marketing stunt and the company has no interest in it.

@_date: 2017-05-24 19:47:44
What ways can the transaction fee get driven down?
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:49:57
Is that 10% of your total valuation or 10% of your investments? IMO, crypto is still settling down and finding its place.  I would want to invest all my money into it just because of the uncertainty of the future.  However, I think it is a good idea to keep your investments spread about.
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:14:24
wait is this compared to the USD? How come there is so much arbitration?
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:48:45
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:29:17
If its too good to be true, it probably is
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:57:39
How does this theory make sense if the amount of trading from China went down so much?

You can look at the past history of the coin on many different websites. My advice is to take it slow and learn about trading, investing, and bitcoin.  Its better to be knowledgeable on what you are putting your money towards.

You could take a screenshot of your keys and then print it out.  That way there is no way to mess up and the data is in a .jpeg format and not a txt file.  You could also put a text file on a USB stick that has your keys.  honestly you should have it saved in a couple of different ways. So I would backup with as many ways possible

I dont think he holds 1million coins, I think he holds $1mil. [There are very few addresses]( with 100,000 coins and most are exchanges.  Even if he held it in multiple accounts, he would have most of the bitcoins available.
