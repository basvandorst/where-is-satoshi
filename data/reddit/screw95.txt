everything happen for a reason don't feel bad that you emptied your wallet, who knows if it would not have been hacked had you not wiped it out, I am just saying, this bitcoin thing is a gamble, you don't have nothing until your money sit in your bank

Everything Happens for a reason, the same shit goes to 911, those who were so pissed off missing a train or bus to make it to work that day, better be damned glad they miss that bus or train. If that makes sense.

I know it is dangerous to breath warm air, but the warm  air delivered by the ant miner, even the ac is running and keeping the house cold, is it safe that these hot air does not go out in the open air but instead suck up by the ac insead?

I think it is more of a safety concern than winning the race, at the speed the race, if they were to look on the mirror to see the car so close to them, they will feel distracted or too cautious and end up crashing

@_date: 2018-03-07 18:09:31

Great Point, Everything Happens for a reason, the same shit goes to  911, those who were so pissed off missing a train or bus to make it to work that day, better be damned glad they miss that bus or train. If that makes sense.
