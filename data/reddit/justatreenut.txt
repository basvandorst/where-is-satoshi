LN n00b question here: I downloaded and ran zap LN wallet. I received some test net bitcoin into the wallet, opened a channel with yalls.org. and sent a few transactions. I also added a few other random contacts. After about 20 minutes my laptop started getting hot and the fan really kicked on.
Why is the Zap wallet requiring so much computing power? Was this my CPU working to run the LN node?

I've been waiting 13 days now. I just sent an enquiry this morning. I would def do the same if I was you.

There's probably been some amount of gold that's been lost forever too, right?
I think once it's lost its lost. If you could quantum compute the private key to lost wallets, then you could do the same for not lost wallets. Or You would essentially have to change the source code to "re-mine" the lost bitcoin. That would never reach concensus. That's why it's important that we all practice safe private key management.

The idea of burning bitcoin is so intriguing to me. Every lost private key contributes to decreasing the supply. If bitcoin is mass adopted, think about how many Joe Schmos around the world are going to lose their private keys. I think in a hyperbitcoinization moment, there will be an increased amount of eternally lost bitcoin.

Has anyone heard the recent news about child porn links on the bitcoin blockchain? I'm not surprised this happened, it seems inevitable. This is the double edge sword of the immutable ledger.  This seems like a good way to attack bitcoin, by outlawing running a node because "they contain illegal material". Any thoughts on how to approach the issue?

This turned out to be a fruitful conversation. Thank you. /s

Have you used bitcoin cash as a currency? I'd be excited to hear about your experience.

I'm in the same boat. And I don't know the answer. But maybe someone will?? ...anyone?
