Here are the details from my email about the next upcoming vote for anyone that doesn't have time to look at HaveLock's site.
"As we are constantly monitoring the evolution and changes happening in the Bitcoin eco-system and accordingly need to adapt to these changes to maximize unit holders revenue we like to propose the following changes:
· Convert the outstanding loan of 342.9 BTC to 4,650 PetaMine units (or 0.0735 BTC/unit) which brings the total outstanding units to 82,142.
· Change the dividend payout to 100%. This gives the opportunity for everyone to choose their own reïnvestment level by purchasing additional units with their dividend.
· Do a reverse split were each unit will be replaced by 14 shares, so 1 unit represents 1 GH/s of hashing power.
· Pay dividends every day at 12:00 GMT.
We are issuing a vote whether or not to switch to implement these changes. The vote will only be valid for current unit holders and held until Thursday, July 9 - 12:00 GMT. Votes will be weighted based on the amount of units of each individual unit holder. Based on outcome, we will make the changes to the PetaMine."

BFL *attempts* to r3wr1t3 their history without telling anyone.
The Internet challenges its *proof of work* with the [source](
**Its super effective!**

[To prevent a common human error I see.](
Yes, I could just keep the money. Very true in your example(s). Another option is to give back the money to the address as well.
One of the problems with crypto-currency is acceptance. If we work on merging current acceptance of FIAT currency/forms of it, then the acceptance rate increases because of the commonalities found vs the new technological differences.
While some might think receiving money from a *random* address is like winning the lotto. As a contractor, I see receiving money under different connotations. To receive such *gifts* or even *virtual items* that hold a relating value is something to consider. It can constitute as bribery. Especially if I track the address down to see that it comes from a **known** address from a company or individual that conflicts with my current services and client. 
In reality if someone attempted to give me a real or virtual *gift* I could simply refute it and not pick it up.
If I have the ability to only accept Bitcoin/Crypto from only certain *known* addresses of my choosing. The expectation is my clients and I are the only ones that will be moving crypto between the wallets. As opposed to the entire cryptosystem influencing our business either out of error or unknown intent.
After reading statoshi's explanation though, there are other parameters to consider.

I'm a PETA investor too and after the [Reverse split of 14 for 1 unit]( (Updates tab), coupled with a daily dividend now the profits are more easily perceived. Cygnify isn't the only one to make a profit at cloud mining.
We aren't debating there *isn't significant risk* and my testimony is in no way an endorsement for the PETA fund. I still hold **strong** reservations about previously voted on items that have yet to be enacted as promised. 
What I'm getting at is cloud mining has the ability to *be* profitable under the right conditions, just like when I mine BTC with my personal mining hardware. *Obviously not with BFL equipment ;) *

Buckle up, here's something beyond a joke to look at when you see KNCMINER is a [platinum member]( in the foundation as well. 
*Just search what 'Observing rights for board meetings' means because it might differ per organization. Platinum members are the only members allowed to enact this benefit according their own site.*

Here is the [P2Pool nodes list]( for anyone trying to find a node near them for low latency. I'm also glad to see over the months most nodes lowered the fee %, eventually phasing it out on the node altogether. You can also inspect what is happening on any of the nodes.
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:42:44
Yes. Thank you for the response. I'll look into other solutions.

Is the contributor you're talking about [Leo]( I'm glad someone is taking some time to look at these guys!
Do you have the emails from Walmart, Amazon, Target, and Authy to show?

Thank you very much for your reply, tip, and explanation of the probability scale of 2^256.
I agree that we will most likely be using social accounts for addresses eventually. As [statoshi]( showed me in his reply to my question its already being explored.

Hello Mr. Lawsky,
We appreciate you coming on this sub-reddit and sharing the upcoming news! Your at least attempting to bridge a complicated gap in communication of government and the people. Even if we don't like what we read from the proposal just remember your one of the few who are *trying* to find a middle ground.
Here are some of the sections that I see already that you might want to look into.
[-Non-PDF source of proposal-](


(1) provide for a system of internal controls, policies, and procedures designed to ensure ongoing compliance with all applicable anti-money laundering laws, rules, and regulations; 
1. *You want to apply ALL the same policies of the US on a freely elected currency that moves globally correct?* - What *controls* would allow these entities to stop a Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency the transaction(s) once started and what consequences or conflicts do you foresee with the blockchain with these controls?
*The world watched corporate entities like HSBC and Chase launder plenty of money with controls in place. All they received were fines.* 




(g). *In general we've witnessed countless breaches in security with financial information, not just with cryptocurrency. When one of these licensed entities gets breached they would not only have the customers wallet addresses but a good amount of data to proceed with plenty of fraudulent activities. To me if the licensed entity doesn't have the due diligence to hire proper IT security they risk all their clients data easily. I like section 200.16 and the promotion of penetration tests but how often would they be done? Remember this is a rapidly moving and growing technology. I think the security section should be more proactive. Meaning the licensed entity should do these tests either every business quarter or at least twice a year.*
4. It sounds like this is for how banks should treat customers and how did you come up with $3,000 being the threshold?
That's all I have for now, thank you for your time.

Thanks for posting that. I was just looking over the 0.92v - *Lockboxes* feature. It looks very interesting, as it will remove the need for *outside* third parties holding funds upon signature approval.
@_date: 2014-07-14 15:38:09
Thank you! Knowledge is appreciated I want to pay forward what was given to me from IkmoIkmo showing me a different example using the ChangeTip system. 
I will take a look at the site when I have more time and see how they tie a virtual wallet to a real person.
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:35:21
Thank you for the clarification.
After looking over a common problem of, *oops I sent it to the wrong address*. I was wondering of a way that the wallet software could auto prompt the user to verify the address or warn the user that the address differs from previous address from the book they have.

*United States Regulatory question:*
The [IRS]( has declared virtual currency to be treated as **property** for taxes. Yet the NY State [proposed regulations]( is attempting to put a liscence on said *property* under **money-currency** rules. At the Federal level crypto-currency is property and at the NY state level (hypothetically) its a virtual unit of currency, correct?
*Bitcoin network-node question:*
From my understanding about running full nodes is that they increase the resolution of transactions. The hinderance of running one is lack of incentive. I found this [link]( on how to create a node with Ubuntu. Can Ubuntu or another Linux distro be installed on a portable drive, then linked to a network router/hub, to be a full working node? I'm looking for a price point in mind, to deploy full-nodes using whatever hardware is available in the environment it is being deployed.
Thank you for your time.

Okay, I didn't want tell you this as it might risk the mission. But rest assured *we* aren't going to *land* on the moon. The plan is to drop equipment, turning it into a rotating full node to speed up the network across the world. Then navigate to the dark side and implement some... cold storage tech. As the commander of the vessel I hope this eases your concerns.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:05:51
We do. You're not alone in the observation. Imo watching develop, it quickly became an echo chamber for many things other than just media. I've spotted information like scam coin pools, trojan wallet developers, and fake startups propagate on many forums. Including this one. The rules on the side are not enforced, allowing it to happen frequently enough to maybe get one or a couple of *new* users that might subscribe to be exploited during the process. Those are *real concerns* of mine other than Mark Karpeles weight.

Let their regulations and licences come. Its habitual and eventual that the old centuries of thinking will attempt to control crypto-currency much like the games they play now with economics.
Let them learn and teach the world crypto will not play in current narrative.

I hope Mr. Fenton takes care of himself in the upcoming acts of the play. As he pointed out there are deliberate attempts being made to disrupt the Bitcoin theatre.
After mentioning the upcoming Winklevosses ETF and also [BIT]( from SecondMarket being attempted. I'm hesitant to participate in them when they're hosted in NY, where these scrupulous players have a home advantage.
@_date: 2014-07-14 13:43:55
Is there a way to tell my wallet **not** accept bitcoin overall? How about not to accept Bitcoin from certain addresses?

Showing the blatant discrepancy between the *edited page/chain* vs the [*genesis page/block*]( If people like you recognize this, that's all that matters.
