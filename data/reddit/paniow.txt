Hello, I'm a Chinese. There is no law against using Reddit or Twitter in China, but you can't access it without a good VPN service. Btw, as far as I know, nobody call Reddit "红网“.

using another wallet to generate a donation address might be better. when you receive enough, then send the bitcoin to your ledger wallet.
