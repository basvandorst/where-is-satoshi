One of the three "verification" steps of a dwolla account is a 30 day old bank deposit. I put $50 into dwolla 8 days ago. Still cant bit instant my cash to bitcoinica.

The amount of transactions has been steadily rising due to the addictive nature of gambling very small amounts of money.
It's hard to stop. Don't start.

LOL! Downvote.

Thanks for being right.

Not sure. Definetly won't work with a bitcoin exchange until your deposit is 30 days old.

I am in the EXACT same boat. I 'll PM as well.

Some things I noticed. I built a rig in February with the same motherboard. 
Huge word of advice, The 3rd &amp; 4th pci express are almost uselss with the size of those cards, I don't think you'll fit 4. If an internet stranger's opinion isn't enough to stop you from trying anyway, please heed my next words of advice.
The cpu power is at the tippity top of the motherboard. There are jumpers you'll be attaching case wires to that are hard to access. Worse than that, the cpu power cable, the one that my case came with anyway (mid-tower, size 4 out 5) is BARELY long enough to stretch over the video card and reach it's connection.
Buy an extra long cpu power off amazon/newegg or make sure you get a case with a top oriented power supply.
Hope this helps! Have fun with the build!

Are you new? Carl Sagan = instant upvotes is a dying fad.

Profitable is relative. You can make money with a 1 year timeframe, but hardly at the quit your day job level.
At the current difficultly it takes on average 4-7 months to recoup the cost of a GPU and the electricity it uses for those 4-7 months.
FPGAs can mine for considerably less energy and without the noise/heat, but the upfront costs are a huge risk.
With the difficulty increasing soon, GPUs can be "profitable" if you plan on running 24/7 for at least a year. When the block reward drops to 25 BTC...I wouldn't be mining unless you're already holding the hardware.

It's incredible to me how entitled bitcoin consumers can be.
Do you think products roll right off assembly lines and ship to customers?
These things need to be stress tested. Why not recoup the cost? To "not effect difficulty"? 
That's a tad bit childish. It's all about you and your mining profit, right?

Controlling your product and the way people interact with it is not 'hating.freedom'.
I don't think I've heard the term 'hates freedom' since George Bush...

I think your reading comprehension is lacking. I answered both.

You need to read up on how mining works, and try not to associate that with your very amatuer pricing valuation. 
The increase of hash power adds security, not speed. ASICS will have little effect on transaction speed.
The protocol is coded to have approximately 10 minute block times, and will adjust itself if the blocks are solved faster. ASICS are just giving machinsts faster machines, on the hopes that they'll get a bigger share of a completely predetermined pie. Once ASICS are mainstream, the difficulty will skyrocket, affecting ONLY two things. Miners' individual profits, and the likelyhood of a 51% attack
It's best to value BTC based on its utility, potential, and Keynesian market factors. Mining has VERY little to do with price.

As an IT Infrastructure professional, I disagree.
Maybe you know something I dont, but I really dont see that happening. Mining is really a niche, and your average bitcoin user isn't making day to day retail transactions using BTC.
Maybe once we're at the rackmounted data center style stage of the mining arms race, your predictions would ring a little true. As it stands though, a 2014 crash is unlikely. It's impossible to deny that BTC is growing, the price is purely speculative and right now has terribly little to do with mining.

No, It's dated in the sense that it's almost impossible to make a computer "do what he wants". In modern times, most cracks are due to a single security flaw that was exploited. There's no wild west like there used to be.
Hell I was just a script kiddie(literally a kid), but I remember blue screening anyone I pleased over AOL. Not possible today.
