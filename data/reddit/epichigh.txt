Could just be growing userbase for now

Yeah, agreed. But I would be shocked if people here actually thought it was something she made up.

You really can't figure out what's special about Dorian?

Where on earth do you live? Bitcoin has been all over the news for some time now. I can't imagine anyone I know thinking this.

This makes no sense

Everyone is different. Many people get bad come downs. You not feeling it is in no way a reason to believe it's a myth.

I mean, that's closer to reality. They have no reason to push anything.

You can debate whether or not it's free or instant, but they definitely shouldn't be in the marketing.
@_date: 2015-10-09 23:21:42
This is completely wrong.

You realize the government provides something in exchange for the tax right? Your analogy would be almost correct if you provided some service.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:06:33
Why do you think it is theft and uncivilized then? Wouldn't it be much more uncivilized to live somewhere without taxes? Without public roads, police, firemen, etc all the infrastructure that the government provides? They need money to pull all that off. It sounds highly civilized to me. The alternative is to live in anarchy.

Fair enough :). I'd continue this debate but this is hardly the place for that.

Most people have a different dream. We want to sustain ourselves or increase our wealth *doing something that we love*. Absolutely no one I know would be able to stand living life on a ranch, including those who grew up doing it and a few who have tried it later in life. We want to do what we love, we want to learn all that we can, we want to meet new people and and travel to new places and experience new things. Money and society allows us all to do this on a level never before possible. I'm very happy. 
Yes we're all going to die, and if you are of the mentality that nothing we do matters because of this, then why live at all? There is no magical purpose to life, you create your own. This, and the experiences along the way, is why we live. You seem terrified of trying to succeed in this world, and so you have settled for having the "American Dream" of just surviving. Don't act like you are wiser than us, though, when you've only given up. You'll miss out on seeing and doing so many things before you die, if you take that route.

Maybe I read it wrong, haha. Thanks for the correction and good luck!
