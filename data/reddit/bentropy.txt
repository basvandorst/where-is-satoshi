It's kind of a little bit not good though.

I like where your head is at. That's a pretty ambitious list of features. We are working on an app you might like. So far we have:
- Getting exchange info 
- Monitor address activities
- Customizable tracking 
- Graphical block explorer
- Alt-coin support: BTC, LTC, PPC, TRC, NMC
- Charts, graphs, stats 
Oh, plus we have embedded webGL and JAVA miners, so you can mine on computers without setting anything up. They put out about quite a bit less than optimal, but innefficient is better than none huh? Especially since you can get every machine that can run java to instantly start mining.
That is a great idea, the account manager. Also the moving addresses between accounts.
If you think of other things, please drop them my way. And if you'd like to help us beta, PM me.

It's already pretty easy to see your transactions.
Of course, it's kind of foggy because of the wall of ugly numbers in your face.
If some such wallet app existed, that had a clean and simple interface like mint, would you be interested in it having a *notes* field with your listed transactions? so you can have record of where the transaction went and for what?
And what else would you be interested in?
And would you like to beta test?

And as for the "card". There are a certain amount of complications with that. It requires agencies with trust and credit to implement. And so far the "trust" surrounding bitcoin has been nebulas and upsetting[1][2].
I mean, when you do a wire transfer, you are not having one of the bank pages stuff a bag full of cash, and run like the wind to another bank, all the while waiting for the confirmation from the other bank.
Those banks trust each other. Value is exchanged one abstraction layer up. This same thing can happen with bitcoin. It would eliminate the hassle of waiting for them to be verified on the network.
Banks in America are pretty content with dollars though. So banking institutions aren't particularly interested in promoting a currency which denies them their hard-earned privelage of marginal reserve lending (making up money, pretending like it's real, and loaning it out). [3]

I happen to know that one is being built presently.
Why do you ask? What would you like to see in such a program?
