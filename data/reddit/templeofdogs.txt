I mean it was a bad idea but you shouldn’t take the money out because as soon as you cash out you lose money. Wait for it to go up again.

The bank account deposit and withdrawal so that I can confirm my bank account only shows up after I cancel and try again :(

I got a physical wallet on amazon, I figured if I'm going to have more than a hundred dollars in bitcoin it's worth storing it somewhere safe
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:08:42
I got the ledger nano s and I think if you buy from amazon it should be legitimate

There was a card inside that said there was no tamper proof seal but I wanted to make sure it wasn't just a trick
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:05:58
Thank you for the info! That's interesting :)
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:59:55
Cool thank you very much :) 
Why do they not put the seal on some?

I don't sell anything, I was joking saying that if you wanted to give away coins I'd be happy to oblige :P
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:06:06
And it did help thank you

@_date: 2017-10-22 00:45:55
I think it's free
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:30:38
Also so I have .01 ~$95 bitcoins in bread. So in November I will have .02 ~$47 each bitcoins in bread?
Thanks for the help by the way
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:07:52

@_date: 2017-10-19 17:06:33

I get free electricity because I live in a college dorm, is it worth it for me? Will I risk messing up my computer?

How do you back up a wallet? I wrote down the 24 words but that's it?
@_date: 2017-10-19 19:01:37
It gave me a 20 word phrase is that what you mean?
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:36:18
I've been ordering in Coinbase and moving to bread 
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:09:37
I only bought 5 months ago so I haven't made any money from Apple :( I'm in college so I don't have too much money I'm just trying to get into the investing game early
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:29:38
What is a fork?
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:05:56
So how does the B2X show up on the wallet like bread? Also why don't people buy a lot of bitcoins before the split so that they just get free money?
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:00:49
I don't quite understand any of this. Recently bought ~$100usd of bitcoin from Coinbase because it is easy to use on my iPhone. 
Do you recommend that I download a bitcoin wallet on my computer and send the bitcoin from Coinbase to the wallet? Also what exactly is this spit everyone is talking about? Lastly how would I buy bitcoin without using the app?
Thank you for all the help! I'm new to this :)
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:28:48
Will it be worth 1/2 as much then? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 00:45:27
Is it worth it though? Won't I get like 16 cents a day?
