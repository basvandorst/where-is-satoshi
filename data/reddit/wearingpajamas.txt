Here’s a story that I wanted to share with you: 
“There lived an old farmer who had worked on his fields for many, many years. One day, his horse bolted away. His neighbors dropped in to commiserate with him. “What awful luck,” they tut-tutted sympathetically, to which the farmer only replied, “We’ll see.”
Next morning, to everyone’s surprise, the horse returned, bringing with it three other wild horses. “How amazing is that!” they exclaimed in excitement. The old man replied, “We’ll see.”
A day later, the farmer’s son tried to mount one of the wild horses. He was thrown on the ground and broke his leg. Once more, the neighbors came by to express their sympathies for this stroke of bad luck. “We’ll see,” said the farmer politely.
The next day, the village had some visitors – military officers who had come with the purpose of drafting young men into the army. They passed over the farmer’s son, thanks to his broken leg. The neighbors patted the farmer on his back – how lucky he was to not have his son join the army! “We’ll see,” was all that the farmer said.”
You never know what would have happened to you if you hadn’t lose those coins. Could you end up dead after doing too much drugs, just because some other rich dude, your friend from your new surrounding, said you got to try it? How about AIDS that you could have caught from some of the most expensive hooker? You don’t even know if your experience of loosing your bitcoins can actually open up some of the biggest opportunities for you in the future. You don’t know. You’ll see.
Good luck to you.

Copenhagener here. 
Did you try to use Copenhagenbitcoin.dk?
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:14:31
You guys should consider yourself lucky if you can’t actually understand what he’s saying 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:16:23
The more expensive the better?

Seems like the guys who put these notes in these cookies know about crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:56:28
We need an AI bot that will understand which posts bring absolutely no value and have to be removed. 
It’s going to be extremely tough though. Imagine how they will stumble on every single mem.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:16:01
I think 1 bitcoin will be enough to buy Tesla by then

Why doesn’t he have a Japanese accent :(
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:48:40
Man that’s exactly the strategy everyone should be having. Because it’s price now will be considered an extreme dip a few years later.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:52:13
Aim higher
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:30:53
Why would you write the prices in $ when we have bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:53:34
I like your profile’s name. Is it a price prediction of bitcoin in two years?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:34:41
Come on mate you are playing safe.
Will you do it if bitcoin riches $200k by the end of 2018?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:43:08
Bitcoin loves us all, too.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:10:58
Every single time I’m waiting for a coin to drop in price it does exactly the opposite for a few months.
You might have the same experience.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:09:17
What if... it’s always in the dip but we never see it?
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:33:28
Was it 9:37? I was told it’s 10:15 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:14:35
But seriously I’m all in, it’s a great idea
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:01:53
Support the idea.
There are those challenges that you can do, for example, you’d have to ask a barista in a coffee shop for a free coffee or do something else that has a high chance of being rejected? 
So you could go on a 30 day challenge asking every single person you interact with [give/take payments] to accept bitcoin.
Who’s with me on that?

The thing about people who invest in crypto that they rarely sell , which makes bitcoin and other crypto keep growing.
Yet people who invest in companies such as Facebook, Twitter, Apple and others usually don’t give a f*ck about those companies per se. I mean, surely everyone wants to double their money but can you imagine a group of investors who have Microsoft stock becoming a community that’s trying to spread the word about Microsoft? Hardly.
I think that’s what makes crypto a completely different game and this thing is going to continue to grow and flourish.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:19:37
If it does I’ll buy as much as I possibly can and say “it’s just a dip”
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:03:55
Dinosaur. It’s a dinosaur.

@_date: 2017-11-25 17:15:39
10k is much closer than we think 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:39:11
You guys know that feeling when sho has lots of nice things on a discount and you just want buy them although you don’t really need them and might never use?
That’s how I feel looking at the crypto market charts. 
Is it just me?
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:49:53
I myself will stock up more bitcoins at 10k. It just feels right.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:34:52
The total market cap is less than $300 billion at the moment. This amount of money is so small that you can hardly notice it on a global scale.
I think it will get dangerous once it reaches $2-3 trillion. Well at least that’s the number I set for myself. That’s when I’ll probably cash out 60-70% of my savings in crypto. 
Once it crashes, I’ll buy as much of crypto as I can, because this thing is going to change the world. The road is going to be bumpy though!
It’s my personal opinion and no one should make their investment decisions based on what I’m saying.
Good luck to everyone.

Lamboland emerges.
