It's good money, but I prefer to keep quiet about it.

It's your individual choice but I am 50/50 bitcoin and litecoin.

Getting loaded, watching Star Wars AOTC, continuing to buy in for the long haul. Feeling unreasonably optimistic tonight.

Merry Christmas, friend!

I just buy buy buy. Late to the game, and I want all the coinz.

I'm a freshly-minted hundredaire, and I want to tell the world! Stop stifling me, HODLer!

If they fall to a buck a coin, I'ma be a one-man rally.

Great article. I am late to the game, but doing a ton of research. I happen to have found myself with a little bit of extra money at this time, and will through that into BTC the same way I would a pker game or a night on the slots: with the understanding that I will have fun, but I may loose it all. The ~$1200 that I am going in with doesn't mean anything in the grand scheme of my life, so why not?
I would not invest my retirement money or my kids' college money in this thing, though...

Well done, sir, congratulations!

It's definitely going to push little-guy first-timers away from the platform, and since the others are not nearly as user friendly and are swamped with new users and delays or freezes on verifying it will keep those investors out if the market.

This. I bought high, and will hodl. I am slathering at the chance to buy low, so I can dig in deeper, even though it's a short-term loss on the buys at 10, 11 and 15...because it's a long-term play. And because I am not playing with resources I can't lose.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:55:34
Yup, primed and ready.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:38:15
20 months is more like it...
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:56:00
Me too, bring it.

No ragrets.

Looks like meat is back on the menu, boys!

I'm a freshly-minted hundredaire, and I take great offense to this post.
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:36:12
HODL 4LIFE?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:14:57
Yeah, was just telling my wife to keep quiet about it. We just got in, but the plays have been working well...
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:54:07
I am buying in, low $$$ but I have faith. Pulling my money out of one hobby and putting it into this (crypto as a category), and it is far more entertaining.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:27:26
Wait, I can buy computers and weed with bitcoin?
