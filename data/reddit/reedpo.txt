For the most part, but the website was so deeply engrained in the actual transaction (and profited from it) that he was considered party to the sale. 
And there was the whole thing where he used his website to try and have another admin killed because money was missing... that was a pretty important part.

Care to enlighten me then?  Or do you have a better one sentence way of explaining dark net?

So what actually happened was one of the other admins of the site was arrested by the police and some money went missing. DPR found out it was this guy, but may or may not have known about the police arrest part.  He solicited a hit man and an FBI agent responded. They faked the murder of this man and delivered the 'results' under the guise of being the hit man.  I am no lawyer, but my understanding of entrapment would not apply here.

Dark net is such a deceiving term. My company's intranet is also part of the dark net after all. Nothing too illicit unless you think that career development webpages and training manuals are illegal. 
The dark net is the internet equivalent of being unlisted in the phone book. If you know where the site is you can reach it.

Yeah/ like 2 or 3 of the Feds involved ended up jailed too because they got greedy

The answer to your question is no, we don't want to give up constitutional rights because of a separate untried case, but are you really under the impression that a man that is hosting and profiting from a website knowingly facilitating drug trafficking and other known illegal activities is not illegal?
Sure, the assassination thing is a red herring in many people's eyes- a big part of that being that the man was never killed and taking such a charge to trial would create a nearly endless legal battle over whether or not it was entrapment.  Why would you chase another charge when you know you have a number of charges that would stick regardless?

I am not great at internet sarcasm

Yeah, he never actually got charged with the murder stuff so the whole drug empire thing was pretty big
