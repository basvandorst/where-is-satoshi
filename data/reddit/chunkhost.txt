We may have to incorporate that image somehow!

We'll plaid.

We give 2TB a month (or more) per chunk, and this is for real. Lots of our customers actually use it, and we encourage that! Popular websites are cool, after all!

Happy to have you as a customer! :)

Ha, thanks! Yeah, that's the biggest hurdle with any new bitcoin venture that involves holding the BTC of others! Calling out scam is always the first (and likely correct!) reaction! :)
We're actually not affiliated with DreamHost.. just started by guys who used to work at / own DreamHost! :) Unfortunately we're not hiring... yet!

Here's another option.. I just set up a "Real" BTC to "MtGox" BTC exchange at 
Here's the announcement at

Hey guys! Since lots of sites use sendgrid, we just wanted you guys to know that they're vulnerable. Someone attempted to hack several of our customers by social-engineering access to our sendgrid account. They got access to the sendgrid account, and though their hack failed, it's the closest anyone has ever come.
If security matters, SEND YOUR EMAIL YOURSELF!

Unfortunately this is true. You know how we find out when someone starts running a tor exit node? It's not by monitoring traffic. Actually, it's because our abuse mailbox fills up with copyright infringement notices referring to that chunk's IP within hours of them starting it up.
So it's not that we care about tor exit nodes, just that the account holder is on the hook for abuse.

Don't forget it's always 5% off when you pay with Bitcoin!
So that means 1 year of a 1GB SSD VPS for ~.087 BTC right now!
@_date: 2014-07-18 02:02:04
I'm pretty sure people are giving the big discounts as a promotional tactic to appeal to the bitcoin user demographic. I doubt everybody will be offering 10% off for bitcoin payments forever.
But OTOH the no-fraud IS pretty nice.

Admittedly this latest twist caught us by surprise, but we've updated the pegging!
@_date: 2014-07-16 21:03:24
Just a heads up... over at chunkhost.com we're essentially exactly like DigitalOcean (but started before them dagnabbit!), and we've accepted bitcoin for over a year, plus we give 5% off for paying in it.
And nowadays we double your ram and transfer if you pre-pay for a year. Which means 1GB of ram with SSD drives and 4TB of transfer for $5/mo (plus 5% off for BTC payment).
We also offer 2FA login to our control panel and host a number of bitcoin sites. We've got about 1,000 customers right now, and it's starting to pick up steam just in the last week actually.

It was mandated by our Department of Redundancy Department.

Chunks get at least 2TB/month of bandwidth, and that's the only limit we enforce. I don't recall anyone getting terminated for bandwidth overages.. well.. ever.
I'm sorry you had troubles with us, I couldn't even guess at what the problem was without knowing your email address, but I hope your new provider is more to your liking!

dropped em! Now just sending ourselves...
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:39:09
Who knows? We certainly wish it was higher! People might be hesitant to realize a capital loss by spending their coins when they're worth relatively little. We sympathize with that.
@_date: 2015-02-27 19:54:59
We've heard on concerns in the bitcoin community that bitcoin-accepting companies haven't seen any bitcoin revenue, and are thinking about backing out.
Our data shows that bitcoin revenue has held steady throughout 2014, and we're certainly not backing out!
@_date: 2015-02-28 02:40:28
We actually changed our rules to require first-time bitcoin payers to pay for a full year! There's another post on this thread explaining why.

Bitcoin is, unfortunately, a magnet for all kinds of abuse: spamming, copyright infringement, hacking, very rarely child porn. And though the vast majority of our bitcoin customers are legitimate, some are not. When an account gets disabled for abuse, the abuser doesn't get a refund, so losing whatever money they'd paid is a disincentive to abuse. The cheapest monthly chunk is $5 per month, and abusers will happily eat the $5 loss, sign up again, and keep doing whatever they were doing.
By increasing the minimum payment from $5 to $60, we forced would-be abusers to eat a bigger loss every time they're caught and disabled. This helped stem the tide of abuse.

Thanks for the post! We actually just posted (  about a secret special promo right now where if you pay for bitcoin we give you double credit! It was going to expire tonight (in 20 minutes) but if you want to sign up and do it a little after and it doesn't give you the double credit just pm me and I'll hook it up!
If you pay with bitcoins you're anonymous too (we get an email address but that's it).

Yeah, shirtoshi is definitely the nicest.. they are &gt;$20 though, but at least worth it!
