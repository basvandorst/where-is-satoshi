Wise words from someone who doesn't use email and personal computers.

Step away from BTC Guild too, try going to the smaller pools.

In RSA, we have (citing Wikipedia):
The public key consists of the modulus n and the public (or encryption) exponent e. The private key consists of the modulus n and the private (or decryption) exponent d which must be kept secret.
Now if we have n and d (the private key), we are only missing e for the public key. But e is often fairly small (less than three digits), or even fixed (a common value is 65537). In these cases getting the public key is trivial.
For Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman, the private key is d, and the public key dG (with G also public), so it's trivial as well.

Well I honestly don't know, the wall is constantly moving up and china buying like crazy. it's either a very good news or a short squeeze. Interesting to watch.
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:33:15
That sentence just contradicts itself. No Intrinsic value but an efficient way to transfer dollars?
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:35:39
The problem is those 17% unknown addresses could be Ghash too
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:26:12
Huge amounts of bitcoins waiting for confirmation to get dumped. My guess is we will see 300s easy
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:49:35
Great :) Just curious, Are you using bitpay? If so, do you have a USD bank account?
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:55:21
ok so it's fine, been waiting hours for 3 confirmations lol
@_date: 2014-03-08 06:53:22
yeah but if it falls more we will enter a downtrend
@_date: 2014-01-04 08:11:01
It's not just Zynga, Other game developers are also thinking to adopt Bitcoin. I work in the game industry, there is no good payment platform out there that accepts money from all countries and doesn't charge insane commission rates (2%-50% depending on the country and payment method). This is just the start. 
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:23:45
Wow, This is big. Steam, Kongregate, Bigpoint, World of Tanks and other big MMO's all use Xsolla.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:16:55
Silkroad news isn't that bad, only 4474 coins stolen.  
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:54:22
That explains the 10k wall guy on stamp who got impatient and dumped it.
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:52:14
Fake. Can't see it on the site 
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:00:51
I just don't understand China, when a news come out they first panic sell, to be sure, and then start reading it lol
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:28:24
Oh god, who are this dumbass jurnalists?
@_date: 2014-03-07 21:20:10
Release it now or shut the F up
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:31:00
Step away from BTC Guild too, try going to the smaller pools.
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:55:51
no they are not
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:03:24
9flats does
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:52:59
we don't know, maybe china is doing the same thing.

What is it Charlie smoking?

With a lawsuit, only the people who sue first can get their fiat funds back, and no one can get a single bitcoin. But if gox proposes a profitable business plan, there is a possibility that people can get their coins/fiat back in 2-3 years. So maybe bad news for people who have money to sue first and had all funds in fiat, but good news for the rest.
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:15:22
Thats not gonna work, they'll  convert those bitcoins to another altcoin faster than you.
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:29:43
because $100 swings are very profitable
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:47:52
Checked Xsolla options on *Steam*, seems it's not been added there yet.  
Checked *Kongregate*, It Has Bitcoin now :)   
Checked *World of Tanks*, no Xsolla option

Although he is not the real Satoshi but I like this guy.
@_date: 2014-04-14 06:11:20
Just found out something important: Some people are spreading FUD so they can buy cheap before the next big pump.  
Caution advised ;-)
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:37:52
sorry you're correct
@_date: 2014-05-30 11:10:47
This would be down voted on too
@_date: 2014-03-06 13:16:45
Wtf. Why reveal his address? I'll not buy or read Newsweek ever again. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:30:30
Step away from BTC Guild too, try going to the smaller pools.
@_date: 2014-07-07 14:01:30
They are right. Lets ban Email and Internet they have been using for 'Jihad', and cash, and cars, and water and... just don't ban the guns, cuz you know, they are good for self defense.

But he never said "Gold is a mirage"
@_date: 2014-02-09 00:18:21
russia/apple already had their effect. Gox first started the drop, so I guess it has somthing to do with it.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:50:54
People who have money over there, Just start taking legal action before it's too late.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:44:47
No offence, I'm just sick of this dumb journalists, copy pasting without knowing shit.
@_date: 2014-03-04 14:38:33
288884 just came.  
@_date: 2014-03-18 07:10:04
$10 drop is significant now?
@_date: 2014-01-12 12:11:42
yeah not much, we had a good resistance at 850, panic just dropped it to 840, anyway I'm happy, got cheap coins :)
@_date: 2014-03-03 08:41:37
Idk, could be insider trading, maybe good news ahead?
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:45:21
If Blockchain says it's in your wallet, then it IS in your wallet. maybe your client is not in sync.
@_date: 2014-03-09 17:43:58
Wtf? an ex employee leaked all this? Now things are getting interesting.
@_date: 2014-03-14 10:32:37
Are you sure the hacker managed to withdraw 18k btc? any traces on the blockchain?
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:48:34
This fud is so fake it's ridiculous
@_date: 2014-03-03 12:52:47
Gox stored passwords in plaintext. In case you used the same password in other places you better change it ASAP.
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:23:31
With all those plain sql queries in the source code, I think it's more possible that money stolen with simple sql injection rather than TX malleability.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:11:03
I don't expect a big drop, too much buy support in Stamp/Huubi, and everyone wants cheap coins. don't be fooled, Silkroad news isn't that bad, only 4474 coins stolen. this will recover very fast.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:27:52
Step away from BTC Guild too, try going to the smaller pools.
@_date: 2014-02-12 05:32:45
Well, Bitcoin Foundation says even the reference implementation has the bug, wonder who is lying here.   
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:22:58
Only 4474 coins stolen:
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:59:58
This is going to fuck up all the TA and psychology behind price, the $1000 ATH had a psychological effect, it gave people a price hook to compare, and now it's fucked. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 09:22:13
I still think that the old man and his family trolled the Newsweek reporter.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:11:42
Feel for you guys, stay strong.   
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:24:00
Get your facts right, Only 4474 coins stolen:
@_date: 2014-01-15 06:04:58
so what now? no deadline?
@_date: 2014-02-28 09:51:44
Bankruptcy Protection, not Bankruptcy.
As per the United States Bankruptcy Code, when an individual files for **bankruptcy** under Chapter 7, it is legally declared that the party is unable to repay creditors and therefore the assets are liquidated to pay the debts.  
When individuals or organizations file for **bankruptcy protection** under Chapter 13 or Chapter 11, they believe that despite being in poor financial conditions currently, given some time, the finances can be reorganized to prove profitable.
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:21:23
thats not correct
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:25:27
Hold on, Everybody hurts  
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:31:39
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:29:40
TL;DR They say there is a bug in Bitcoin, and they will NOT resume withdrawals until bitcoin foundation fixes it.
Brace for impact guys :(
@_date: 2014-03-07 13:02:02
probably they are testing to reopen the exchange?
@_date: 2013-12-05 11:27:19
We need to ask Chinese people to see if it's good news or not, it seems Bitcoin is banned for vendors too, any Chinese here?
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:24:10
That's cool, how about we ban the Chase. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 12:28:24
I just want to ask a question:  
In far future, If humanity decides to move to another planet, are they going to take all the gold and cash with them?  
I'm serious.
