which happens all the time, your point?

well to be exact, USD bills are not made of paper (at least not the kind you use to write on) theyre made of cotton "paper", you didnt answer my question though, what is the USD without its government? if the US government were to collapse tomorrow, would your pieces of paper be worth anything? and yes, bitcoin is just a hash, that is all you're receiving, as someone said before, its simply someones account on the ledger being deducted x coins, and x coins being added to your address, there is nothing behind it, so try not to add your preconceived ideas on it, because it will only make it more complicated

its a nice way of making lots of upfront money, say my rig can make 10k a year, i could sell you a contract for my rig for 8k and use that to buy more rigs rather than wait nearly a year

the people that refuse to talk on loony places like reddit and bitcointalk :D? i figure theyre probably hiding out in irc's  and twitter somewhere
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:02:52
it doenst have to consist of anything, your USD dollar stays afloat because of the government, without the government, its just a piece of paper, and that definitely isnt worth much, a bitcoin is just a number, its worth as a currency is based on peoples belief on the technology being worth something, if everyone in the world thought bitcoin was worthless, it would be worth 0, if everyone thought it was worth at least 10000, it would be worth 10000

why are they lucky? bitcoin has been around for 4 years lol, the REALLY lucky ones are the ones who got to mine when cpu mining was a thing

bank servers rely on internet too, so unless you never use a bank or atm i dont see how your argument is valid

just like normal stocks tbh, unless the company stock price rises like crazy (a gamble both in real stocks and in cryptostocks) and the dividends are meh, at least in that aspect cryto's probably give way more in terms of dividend rate

what kind of idiot who is trying to be anonymous would use his real name &gt;.&lt; you are clearly underestimating satoshi, also your facts seem to be a bit "off" in the sense that the ONLY "proof" that dorian is satoshi, is from the person who wrote the article, with absolutely no proof other than her word on it

you cant accidentally lose it, you're either very forgetful, or a dumbass, you literally have to delete the entire wallet with the .dat or somehow lose your HDD and your backup to even "lose" your bitcoin
@_date: 2014-02-02 21:13:40
because no one knows for a 100% fact that bitcoin price will rise, if bitcoin price stays the same, miners are 100% better than just buying btc, assuming you have enough hashing power to still make profit despite difficulty increases, or at least thats how it works out in my head
edit: this is all assuming difficulty doesnt rise at 100%+ per month and price stays at a stable 800-900 usd, also, for some reason having a miner is more fun than just having a wallet full of bitcoins, if you know what im saying
@_date: 2014-07-25 02:08:53
now if only cryptostocks would remove their .005 btc withdrawal fee 
@_date: 2014-08-10 12:33:55
yeah, i like to have as many as i can, but i dont think "accidentally sending coins to the wrong address/chain" is really a valid point, thats like accidentally sending a check to the wrong person, its completely your fault

no they did not, in the same way the jews didnt break any laws when millions of them were slaughtered in concentration camps during ww2, however, that and breaking the law and being put in jail are not the same, and its a little ignorant to even try and argue that theyre the same thing
@_date: 2014-08-10 06:27:05
its not semantics, you can tell a lot about a person based on their handwriting, dont the police sometimes use that to find killers that leave notes? of course we're talking about the internet here but if dorian didnt know how to type/speak proper english while satoshi could write it very well, it would point to one of 2 things, dorian is not satoshi and has no involvement in the creation of bitcoin or 2. satoshi is actually multiple people and dorian is not the one who wrote anything
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:47:08
dont think that the community is the actual bitcoin community, this is reddit :v

its not so much a contradiction than you cherry picking events that occurred before either of us were even born, heck, you could probably combine our ages and it was STILL before that (around 70 years ago)... hopefully stuff like this doesnt happen anymore, and hopefully will never happen ever again

i feel so bad for you :v just imagine if you held out until it hit its high of 1.1k-1.2k (thats 550k minimum for people bad at math)

why would they put me in a literal cage? and why would they kill me for not paying their taxes? im pretty sure in reality, they would just put me on trial and then put me in jail?
@_date: 2015-05-24 04:42:31
you're not the only one that can make shitty analogies, and as for how theyre similar, you pay taxes for a service, namely living on the US governments land, driving on their roads, electricity, water etc
and as for "you can stop paying at any given time", you cannot stop paying for the services AND continue using the services, in the same way you cannot (by law) stop paying for taxes and still continue to use the public services that are entitled to you from paying taxes, get it?
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:00:55
dont break the law if you dont want to be put in a "cage" then, its pretty simple i guess? if you dont like it, you're free to move to a country that doesnt have taxes,  which is basically the cayman islands , some middle eastern countries,  and the bahamas 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:04:07
much like money nowadays, a good portion of money is no longer in physical money, but rather as numbers on a computer somewhere (as in, there is more money in the "system" than there are if we added up every bills by its "value")
@_date: 2015-05-23 08:59:00
in what country would you get straight up murdered for resisting all of the time? sure it happens, sadly, too often, even 1 case is in 100 is too often, but its not such a common occurrence, normally when you resist arrest, they just fuck you up, and if you put it into actual real logic and sense, the person you're resisting against is a human, when you resist arrest, you run the risk of injuring them, as such, police officers are granted the right to stop people from resisting arrest, normally by pinning them to the floor and then hand cuffing them (this is the majority of cases), piling on them with multiple people, probably hitting you a few times on the way down (the 2nd most likely event) and lastly, killing you, normally in self defense, but in very rare cases, in cold blood (any time a cop has killed a guy that was effectively harmless falls under this "rarity among rarity" case)
im not going to argue whether violence is ok when you resist arrest, in fact, im pretty sure theres a country that has a law (clause?) that states that its in human nature to resist arrest and as such, dont fault them with an extra crime for it, but that doesnt mean you can generalize and blanket statement every modern country in the entire world lol
tl;dr : **dont generalize an issue, and resisting arrest is dumb and you should never do it unless you're willing to risk hurting another person, yourself, and possibly an extra charge against you after already committing a crime in the first place**
@_date: 2015-05-27 22:00:39
sigh, if someone is stealing your car, they can shoot you, its legal to stop them, but that doesnt mean they will let you, the only difference between that and trying to stop the police is that the police are legally allowed to stop criminals with force when necessary 
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:51:15
are..are you comparing being in a jail cell/house arrest to being in an internment camp/concentration camps 0_0?
@_date: 2015-05-25 11:45:35
wow thats a lot of hypotheticals, too bad in reality 99.9% of people that refuse to pay taxes dont get murdered, they go to jail, now, the real question is, what do you mean "defend yourself", by definition, you arent defending yourself unless a person is attacking you actively, if i made a hypothetical using your logic, if my car was getting repo'd, and i "defend" myself and my posessions (read as assault someone), you think that would be totally fair? in that scenario and yours, the one whos truly defending themselves are the police officers and the guy doing the repo, not you nor i lol
@_date: 2015-05-23 21:18:12
i have my own morality, but at the same time, im not dumb enough to break the law for something thats not worth it, i would never risk my life, and my families livelihood for something like tax evasion (if refusing to pay taxes would get me killed), and if you dont get killed for it, i STILL wouldnt risk going to jail to save a few hundred/thousand $ lol, im not that cheap
@_date: 2015-05-23 03:49:04
what if you're on house arrest? cant leave your house then, so would it be a cage at that point?
@_date: 2015-05-23 01:49:07
depends on how technical you want to get, is a house a cage? no? what if your window has bars, is it a cage now? either way, if the cage is the size of a small room, aside from obviously being in jail, which is a form of punishment, its not as if theyre sticking you in a dog cage (a literal dog cage)...
@_date: 2015-05-23 04:31:49
thats a pretty loose definition of cage, and i see your point, but at the same time, the only reason youd get into these "cages" is by doing something against the law, which might be against your will at times 
@_date: 2015-05-24 13:58:08
i see what you mean but dont agree with you, ive already laid out the choices you have if you dont like it XD
@_date: 2015-05-22 18:17:10
well its simple, just like any 'modern" country, if you dont pay your taxes (which is illegal), you either 1. flee the country 2. get imprisoned, im not too sure about getting killed, i mean, maybe in north korea, but i cant imagine that happens to often in 1st world countries 
@_date: 2015-05-23 22:33:05
tax isnt theft.... this is like saying "paying 150$ for cable with 400 channels is theft because i only watch 10 channels!", just because you dont use ALL of the services provided to you as a tax paying citizen, does not mean that you have the right to NOT pay for those services, this is the 21st century, if you dont like it, risk going to jail for not paying your taxes or leave the country

@_date: 2013-11-25 11:43:33
i earned my first btc from flipping through profit i guess, i had .05 from mining with block erupters and i bought some shares to a company through bitfunder, a few days later the price rose a ton and sold it for .2 total, then rinse and repeat for over a whole btc :B although i ended up cashing them out at around 200~ :( wish i had saved it
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:55:17
there isnt much you can get with under 500, probably just an asicminer blade (10ghash) for around 400 usd
on the bottom of that page it shows all known asics
@_date: 2013-12-16 01:10:03
thats probably the only reason why i would use cex over cloudhashing, its almost the same price per ghash too, but the interface is really nice
