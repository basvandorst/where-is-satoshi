Interesting that the Portuguese Association for Consumer Protection (DECO) put its weight behind this. That is positive news.
[Here]( I read that DECO determined that this action (by Santander) had "no legal support basis in Portuguese or European Union laws."
Santander complains about something "not regulated” and then reacts in an unregulated and possibly illegal way itself.

It seems the Bitcoinist author missed the cynical undertone in Sachs' so-called acknowledging Bitcoin's strengths. And Sachs is wrong there. As many court cases have demonstrated by now, Bitcoin's strengths do not include safety from confiscation by the state. And insofar Bitcoin enables safety from taxation, it does so only for those people who are willing to break their nation's tax laws which often demand disclosure of cryptocurrency possessions.

Cryptocurrencies themselves are already regulated, by mathematics, and no government or international public institution can change that.
They can however regulate some things in relation to cryptocurrencies, for example to ensure taxes are being paid, investors are being informed and, generally, to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing and what have you. 
Many people assume that that kind of regulation will mean the end of cryptocurrencies. However, that remains to be seen. I see it more as a condition for a wider adoption. Government regulation could very well help establish cryptocurrencies.
I agree with Moonccy below that it is very unlikely that Western governments will "ban" cryptocurrencies, in the form of outlawing people to use it. Where freedom is the principle and various relevant freedoms are even protected by law, it would be very difficult for them to go down that path.

The U.S. House Financial Services Committee hearing on Libra today was okayish, but so many senators were not listening to the witness at all and simply read out their own statements. The contributions of the chair itself and senators San Nicolas and Casten were seriously  below standards I think, the latter even knowingly falsifying an answer the witness had just given.
"Carsten: Does the Calibra wallet require a bank account?
Marcus: No Congreswoman.
Carsten: So if your solution to the world's unbanked is a currency that requires them to have a bank account and (...)"
Although Marcus interjected "It doesn't", Carsten, ignoring him, just went on reading her own statement. Carsten stated earlier that the purpose of the hearing was to verify, but she herself clearly demonstrated it wasn't.
(Around 2h18m into the hearing.)
Edit: These senators, sitting and behaving like kings of the realm, are demanding a lot of respect. But even these kings should treat witnesses they invite to appear before them with some basic decency and courtesy. And for some senators that was too much to ask. On a positive note, there were also interesting lines of questioning, for example from Ocasio-Cortez and from the senator who could actually read code.

You start with the wrong assumption that I have assumed you are not an EU citizen. Your second false assumption is that I said that the tea party movement is as dangerous as Hitler or Stalin. They are dangerous, but not that dangerous.
I am not obliged to become your history teacher or personal archivist, but look at groups of people in which there are no laws or in which existing laws don't mean a thing. An actual example, the ISIS, which also fights against the concept of the national state.
I am not against North-America nor the USA, but the idea that you are better off without or with the tiniest of tiniest governments is just utter bullocks and almost brought the world to financial collapse. I hope they will soon take back control of all no-go areas, disarm private individuals and finally get some necessary infrastructure work done, like fast trains, renewal of bridges, protection against floods etc.

In the Arab world it may work best if such exchange services (bitcoins &lt;&gt; local currency) are located in the easily accessible mobile telecom shops. 
Once the Arab people 'in the street' understand that people from all over the world (also their relatives and friends residing in other Arab countries or in the US or Europe, etc.) can easily send bitcoin to them (or receive bitcoin from them) through a simple mobile phone wallet and they can just walk into a shop and get cash for those bitcoins, this will really take off.

So many arab people have a mobile phone and know how to use the internet, but do not have a bank account. 
If there would be services available in major Arab cities like Cairo, Damascus, Beirut, Amman, Baghdad, Alexandria, where these people can change the Bitcoins (or Dogecoins, etc) on their mobile wallet for local fiat currency, I expect the use of digital currency will see explosive growth there.

Apparently the person running the place has chosen not to give any decent contact information which could be used to warn him. Bad for him if he loses money this way.

not in detail  since I  am not a  specialist,  but the general line would be to  impose obligations on  providers of  any Bitcoin services, to properly id themselves to the authorities before being allowed to legally enter the market. All kinds of additional obligations, e.g. track record info, are thinkable, though perhaps not necessary.
Do not expect this to erase the problem, it just makes it more difficult for scammers.

I do not know whether there is a "former" name(s) section in the company registration forms. Do you know that? Presumably, if he left that field blank, Companies House will have thought he did not have any name change. 
His leaving the field blank would be illegal if the form says that the undersigned filled out all applicable fields of the form truthfully and completely, or when there is a legal rule saying that someone registering a company must fill out all fields applicable truthfully and completely.

I do not agree with the principle of non-aggression: with hindsight it would have been so much better for the world if the US attacked nazi Germany much earlier.


I agree with that as a principle, but not in an absolute way. Where the speaker at 5:06 says that these principles should have no limits I do not agree with him.
If personal property is harmful I think a society has a moral right to take that property away, for example weapons, but for example also houses that stand in the way of necessary defensive structures against water floods.

The nature of religion is that belief is not kept to yourself but imposed on others. At Nascar they mass pray before races, US presidents invoke God all the time. In other countries they kill you if you don't believe along. In the middle of America there seem to be a lot of rightwing nutters toting guns and completely convinced that the White House is the incarnation of the devil and the US government a cancer on the land of the free. Lots of average Joes among them. So don't be surprised that also in the Bitcoin sphere there are evangelists and anarchists.

You're probably right, it depends a bit on how they handle this case and organize their fees. But at least these legal proceedings can bring clarity about what happened, something which Vernon almost autistic-ally denies his customers.  
Forget I told you so sayers. For the average person it's very hard to determine why exchange x would be more trustworthy than exchange y. And often a lot of differences between exchanges are overlooked in recommendations, such as available pairs, or real time market activity displays (Poloniex lacks these for example).
Sometimes an exchange can be run by trustworthy people and still disappear for various reasons, for example Yacuna or Mintpal 1. In the latter case, in itself trustworthy people sold the exchange to a scammer.

My **CRYSTAL BALL** says ups and downs for the days and weeks to come, with a steady long term rise. It may well hit 1000 again. In any case don't buy at 1100 right now if you don't feel comfortable doing so. In that case you'd better put a buy order well below 1000 and have a good night's sleep. Given today's ATH of around 1350, you probably won't wake up to a dramatic new rise.

What would be a good altcoin to store one's bitcoins in from now on until 11th March? I mean an altcoin which would preserve their present usd-value.
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:59:29
Interesting point you make there. Indeed, the SEC did not paint a completely doomed future for Bitcoin trading on regulated markets in the US. An important fact may be that China seems to be busy nowadays with implementing some forms of regulation, and there are of course regulated markets which already accept Bitcoin tracker fund trading, for example the Sweden Nasdaq.

Can you be more precise? You should enter the seed of your now empty Electrum wallet into electron cash. Then your Bcc balance should show up. What also helps is restarting your electron cash wallet after that.

more or less yeah
the bch or bcash affair has learned that it is not so easy for any group of miners or related businesses to fork off successfully and become a real competitor of bitcoin
perhaps that is the reason why the 2x camp is relatively silent at the moment, since their code adaptation would require a fork as well because core is not supporting it  
@_date: 2017-08-01 06:27:20
not very informative on the segwit2x part, because it assumes the 2x part is automatically following the "activation" of segwitex, which is not true, if I am correct, and the very reason for the creation of bcc.

the thing is that normally it would shoot up until the positive event and while the event is taking place and shortly after it would go down again a bit
in this case it's about a software update (sorry techies, but this is how I translate it into normal language) and at least in theory there is always a risk that it will not run as smoothly as planned despite all the testing..

This [Coindesk article]( says lock in is expected around block 479 708.
According to [Blockexplorer]( we are at block 479 676. So, just 32 blocks to go?
Not according to [Coindance]( which says there's still 131 blocks ~~to go~~ **Edit:** *remaining in this signalling period. Further above, in small letters, Coindance mentions: "1916 blocks (95%) in the current 2016-block signaling period are required for BIP 141 (Segregated Witness) lock in".*
**Edit:** Realized it's the 95% thing. Right now 16:05 CET, there are still 26 blocks to go.

There have been and still are numerous coins with "bit" and "bitcoin" in their name without having the slightest impact on Bitcoin's brand identity.
All in all, securing SegWit (activating later this month) has been a very positive outcome of the scaling civil war. Another positive point is that the opponents to Core's scaling roadmap are now divided into two camps (1. Bcash; 2. Those still clinging to SegWit2x), which weakens them.
@_date: 2017-08-20 20:19:28
good question indeed how many btc users actually managed to get their free money from the bcash launch, I expect the number to be sizeable but probably not a majority
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:01:39
yeah you're right, I'll try to look it up in the coming days, but I am pretty sure I read something was wrong with the invitations to core if there were any

The 3rd legal attack may also benefit bitcoin if it takes out bad apples.
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:50:24
In the process they hurt all future Chinese digital currencies as well.  Destroyed all trust.
@_date: 2015-08-14 10:31:58
not so sure about that.. it could be interpreted as an indication they are slightly uneasy about being associated with bitcoins, which may not be the smartest move if you're named "InsideBitcoins"

Your own post is pretty empty with respect to that "actual Chinese regulatory action". Share your info if you have any.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:17:34
Even if that China token proves to be successful, it has very little to do with what makes bitcoin special and important.

Okay, so how could the Russian government control Ethereum?
@_date: 2017-09-12 22:11:44

If they would eradicate the fake volumes and systematic scams from those exchanges and close a few in the process, that would be beneficial to bitcoin. It remains to be seen, however, whether the reasons which you mention are indeed the real motives for the announced policy moves.

@_date: 2017-09-11 00:41:12
To be honest, I don't think today's Russia is totalitarian. Rather, it is autocratic and its citizens have only had experience with personal and political liberties since, given and take, 1991. And, true, their personal and political liberties are much less protected by the government and the judiciary than in the West. At first glance also China does not come across as a totalitarian state to me.
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:00:04
Well legally and morally OP would have to give it back in that case.
You seem to argue, he does not have to give it back because it seems impossible to enforce that legal and moral rule.
Still, there are people who wouldn't murder even if they were in perfect circumstances to get away with it.  
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:15:02
what is that bcash doing there, as if it can compare with bitcoin and ether
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:33:36
As a decentralized store of value and payment system which gives people monetary power independent from governments and banks, bitcoin is a problem in countries with traditionally centralized power structures and a more collective mindset, such as Russia or China.
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:23:23
Well, then you are wrong. I bought socks with bitcoin, perfectly legal. 
And besides that, it is used in more ways than just as a currency. While living in Europe, I also bought some things from a shop in California. Wouldn't have done that if I had to go through the slow motions of the international bank transfer hell.

If they would ban it, they could only ban it in China. It's not the end of the world, and much less the end of Bitcoin, which will continue to exist regardless.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:45:08
Alright. Apart from that, there is still something called law, and prohibitions can indeed be enforced. Sometimes tech buffs underestimate that. Surrounding this rumor lots seems to get lost in translation by the way.
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:33:37
your text contains the answer how 'a ban' works..
@_date: 2017-09-15 01:48:32
Some government regulation surrounding bitcoin exchanges and start ups to protect users from scammers, fraudsters and to combat ml may benefit bitcoin. Several states in the US and elsewhere have done the same.
The spooky, shady way in which these recent Chinese policy measures are introduced however makes one suspect that the aims mentioned above are not really what this is all about.
 
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:16:32
somehow reassuring that some in the Chinese politburo want to buy some bitcoins too and are creating a buying opportunity for themselves
@_date: 2017-09-09 02:16:07
No, but there are some threads here with an attempt at translation; it looks as if this whole (lack of) news story today has been based on an inadequate translation, in combination perhaps with a slightly unclear expression by the anonymous source (of the Caixin article) of the precise intent or plans of the Chinese government.

@_date: 2017-09-08 13:27:04
At your first point, I would say the value lies in the fact that bitcoin provides a decentralized (store of value and) payments system that is independent of those banks and players like Amazon, Microsoft and you name it. That protects your money from bank fuck-ups like in 2008 and from policies of governments and businesses that are detrimental to the value of your fiat money or Amazonians or whatever centralized tokens you have.

@_date: 2017-09-08 22:12:42
Yeah, but such a centralized cryptocurrency is not what cryptocurrency, certainly not bitcoin, is about. It destroys its unique selling point. It would be merely a digitalized form of the ruble.

Well for example if grandparents or other family members live far away, they can still give money to the child's piggy bank. 
It makes sense since a kid normally does not have a bank account and even if it would have a savings account, people would not send very small sums by bank transfer. 
For the kid, physical coins would be harder to spend online later on.

Text from: 
"Broadly speaking, there are really 2 types of “signaling.”
"The first type is signaling support." 
"This requires that actual Bitcoin software has been written to monitor the signals and, once these signals reach some kind of threshold, something actually activates in all of these Bitcoin clients. For example, code for the Segregated Witness soft fork as included in Bitcoin Core clients, will enforce the Segregated Witness rules once 95 percent of newly mined blocks include a specific piece of data in the coinbase strings. If that happens, all these nodes will actually reject transactions and blocks that break the SegWit rules. (Edit: It should be noted that SegWit signaling doesn't use the coinbase transaction for signaling, but the block header.)"
"The second type is signaling intent." 
"As opposed to signaling support, signaling intent doesn’t actually do anything on a technical level. Rather, it's literally miners sending a message to the world, which has in the past, for example, been used to state a preference for a potential scaling solution. (While miners can also do this through letters or blog posts, coinbase signaling cannot possibly be faked, so it’s a bit more reliable.)"
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:15:06
Thanks. I am interested in that second part. From your answer I make up that the 2x part is not an automatism, but that it requires the signers of the NYA to stay on board for that 2x part after SegWit has activated.

Well, bank deposits are insured by law up to 100k euro in Europe at least. Sending bitcoins to a wrong address  basically means they're gone (legally you have a claim on the receiver, but there is no infrastructure to enforce that claim). Dangers of hacking, software or hardware glitches, losing passwords, private key documentation etc etc. In normal finance banks take away most of these burdens (for a fee), in Bitcoin you're solely responsible as a user. 
@_date: 2017-07-03 12:09:26
.. addresses
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:45:06
From a user's perspective the core value of decentralization would be that you do not need a middle man to send money to someone else. This revolutionary feature also means the user himself becomes responsible for security, which is one of the factors preventing mainstream adoption so far.

Perhaps it would be better than to set some standards before allowing devs to use the name "Electrum" in their project, so as to protect the good name of other Electrum devs. If that is not possible for whatever reason, outsiders will make these associations.

Then why is it part of the scaling road map? It would make sense that if you separate signatures from transactions, you get more space in a block, allowing for more transactions - which is scaling.
