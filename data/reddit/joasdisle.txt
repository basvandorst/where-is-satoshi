You can buy with credit card paypal or sth, or use some bitcoin faucet to earn them
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:07:18
You can attempt to launch the client via the command line and add the -salvagewallet option this attempts to recover and dump the private keys from the wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:58:57
No it's not that way at all
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:43:06
I thinks it is, so get away form there
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:20:46
Yes it already happening, and it's the right time for bitcoin to take control over all
@_date: 2016-04-12 13:20:57
Can tell for sure, probably something with the wallet and needs to be restarted or sth. 
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:39:16
This is confusing but I think it refers to something else
@_date: 2016-04-13 16:44:51
