I've always thought of hard forks more like bastard children.  Maybe should have been an abortion, but there they are.

Doesn't hyperinflation usually happen when the supply of something goes up?  The supply of BTC is currently a little over 16 and a half million and the total created when it's all said and done, according to the code, will be right around 21 million.
Are you absolutely sure there isn't some utility in the code that could justify the price and institutional interest?
