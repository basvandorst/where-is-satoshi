I laminated a yellow folder with inside the paper with private key and recovery instructions for wife. On folder I wrote 'Open when I'm dead'. I bought a 250lb American Security safe (fire and burglar proof) where I put it along with important documents, my Rolex and other family invaluables. It will withstand 1800degrees for 2 hours and one inch steel plate behind the key pad. Now I can leave the house and do not worry about my Trezor. Considering selling the watch to buy more BTC.

Is there a tool to automate the DCA? Anything other than Coinbase where fees are very minimal? Thx

You owe it to yourself to do a lot of research and run thru some drills. Buy some btc on Coinbase or similar and download a wallet, send yourself small amounts of btc between wallets. Buy/use a dedicated computer for your crypto. Get a feel for managing your btc before u buy more than your confident to manage yourself off Coinbase. Roll up your sleeves and get to it. That's how I learned what's best for me and gained some crypto confidence.

ShapeShift to LTC or other to send the payment faster, cheaper. Depending on the SS spread.

Are you looking for short term gains or long term? 1-2 years or 20? If long btc, buying now is good and you didn't miss it completely (All human intervention  that could phuck it up not considered)
