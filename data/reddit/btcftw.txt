It might be reasonable to allow FSS RBF to only decrease an output.  So the money must go to a txn fee.  The attacker would have to be in partnership with a pool.   And if that was the case you could do RBF today by sending a private txn to them.

Yes.  And they can do so by producing blocks lower than the limit.  Allowing them to vote on the limit lets them force their opinion onto other miners.
This debate is really about whether the block size limit should be a sanity check that is rarely hit (Satoshi's original formulation), or a dial actively used to manipulate the network.

why don't u fly to china with 20k USD in cash, hand it to some random guy, ask him to STORE it for you for 6 months and see how that works for you? Bitcoin does not reward being stupid.
regulations didn't help the countless ppl who lost money from failures of cyprus banks US funds enron etc.  Regulations and licenses may reduce the likelihood of default but probably just by raising the bar for entry.  There is no silver bullet here.  Bottom line is do your own research and diversify.

Yes expecting sidechains to help scalability presumes the 90/10 rule -- that is, 90 pct of a person's txns are very similar (so presumably he already has coins on the SC for these).
But one common misunderstanding is that you'd use the reverse peg to move stuff around.  Arbitragers would do that.  You'd buy from them via something like shapeshift.io.
But you are right if you did that every time scalability would actually be worse.  Presumably you do it once a month or so... and you'd have to run multiple wallets.  It's not pretty which is why we NEED to scale bitcoin as far as the technology and infrastructure allows.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:13:50
Of course, there are natural scalability limits to the linear blockchain structure that 1mb or even 8mb blocks are no where near touching.

There are some interesting ideas in there.  He should spend more time writing about them and less knocking down other people's ideas.
One problem with having miners vote on the block size limit is that they will force its reduction to maximize profitability.  Econ 101: limiting supply to maximize profitability at the expense of the service as a whole.  There are a lot more people with stake than miners at this point... and miners ALREADY have the power to simply not mine large blocks.  If large blocks really were not profitable at all, no miner would mine them even if the limit was high.

@_date: 2015-06-24 13:23:59
That sounds very interesting and similar to what I proposed in allowing higher fee txns be placed "beyond" the baseline block size and what meni proposed where miners pay into a pool for bigger blocks.  This class of proposal allows supply to expand on a temporary basis which is important for economic supply demand curve analysis. 
But it does not address 10x 100x 1000x adoption.  I see sidechains or lightning helping at 100 or 1000x but your attempt to hobble bitcoin before its natural limits is seriously damaging your credibility.

The argument is not presented fairly.  It is inflammatory.  For example he says "you might end up on the wrong side of the fork".  But by default your coins will exist on BOTH forks.

In case you are a newbie who is honestly asking:  The lack of high bill denominations, inflation,  and civil forfeiture laws make banking essential to people with savings or those transferring a moderate amount of money.  But it has been known for a long time that banks profit to the detriment of their customers.  If you doubt this just look at the public filings for major US consumer banks. Bank of america for example.  They make their revenue from fees like bounced checks.  This breaks the classical theory of economic good, which states that contracts are beneficial to both parties.  They are making money at their customers expense.   The theory of mutual benefit is true due to efficiencies gained from specialization... that is I can do better by just making shoes and trading them for food then if I both made shoes and grew my own food.  But people dont have checking acts because the bank is offering a mutually beneficial service anymore.  They have them because they must have them to work with nontrivial amounts of money in this society. 
 Bitcoin will make it possible for you to stop using banks if it becomes more universally accepted.

That's what happens when you try to bootstrap a world currency.  If btc becomes universal demand will be so high that people who own just one will be considered rich. 
People have an easier time dealing with millions rather than .0000001 (millionths) and also its psychologically a bummer to buy .005 of something rather than 500 of another thing.  So as adoption increases we need to start using smaller units.  There was debate about first going to thousandths (mBTC) but the problem with that is we might have to switch units AGAIN in 5 to 10 years if Bitcoin fulfills its potential.

If you want to order a society, its likely a good idea to not allow loans for interest denominated in a noninflationary currency.  Because the loanee is fighting both the interest and potential deflation.  Many societies including christianity discouraged charging interest when they were using gold and silver as currency.  Search "ursury"... today the term is synonymous with loan sharking, but historically it means charging any interest at all.

I'm saying report what you DO charge a fee for. The transfers.  "On 6/27 100000 cny was deposited, 50000 cny removed."  Delay the report by a few days to avoid traders using the data to front run a big buyer.  Clearly this number does not help people to compare your exchange with exchanges that do not report these flows.  But what it does is tell us that your exchange is busy AND that you are making money.  The latter is very important if you want me to trust your exchange with my deposit.

You have good thoughts but I don't think miners should exclusively control supply because they benefit with a small supply by driving up txn fees.  Remember a miner can always choose to not fill a block if it really is unprofitable for them to do so. I agree that picking a hard number for the txn fees to expand the block is a small problem.  But I still think that there are simple solutions. First expand or contract the max block sized every N blocks based on how full prior blocks are. Like difficulty adjustment.  Then to handle short term demand fluctuations use the average txn fee of the last 5 blocks as the baseline and block-expanding txns need to pay a fee that is a multiple of this baseline.

The supply side of the supply demand curve is a wall. That is, space within the block cannot increase if more txn fees are paid.  So fees will rise very high rapidly, and the problem will only be solved when users leave the network (by definition because supply cannot rise demand must fall).  Stagnant growth is a disaster for bitcoin right now.

1. Dev schedules are notorious for being unreliable. 
2.  I read an analysis here on reddit I think by the LN guys.  Sry I don't have the link.  But yes LN could let us scale a few more orders with current block size.
3. Who knows what LN fees will be.  Esp once SEC starts mandating compliance to the LN money transmitter companies.
4. LN essentially aggregates small txns.  Presumably because blocks are full and so txn fees are very high.  So hobbyists *could* use the blockchain but fees would be so high it would be impossible in practice. 
5. Bitcoin is not changed but ppl can't afford to use it.  But colored coins etc can't he sent thru the LN because it aggregates sends.  So the coins you send are not necessarily the exact coins received.

Allow high fee txns to extend the block size beyond the default max proportionally to the txn fee.  This allows high importance txns thru or forces the attacker to spend a huge amount of $ on txn fees.
Also if miners voluntarily chose to fill the first 2 MB (say) with the highest sum of 10 days destroyed then the attackers coins would be prioritized below most normal users pretty quickly.

But look at the supply curve of txn capacity.  Its not a curve its a wall.  When we hit it txn fees could rise dramatically. And long confirm times will discourage use of bitcoin when alternatives exist.  So black market use will climb and other use fall.  And capacity will start moving to alt coins on these markets due to confirm times.

No one wants the pain of rehashing this every few years.  But Gavin et.al. was willing to compromise with just 20MB.  But if the other side will not compromise we might as well go back to the calculated best solution.   Please note that you dont HAVE to fill blocks to the max.  Also note that in a few years if the projections are shown to be incorrect and that is a problem we can always do another hard fork to adjust them.
In other words given a successful bitcoin, there is a chance that no future hard fork will be necessary if the algorithm gradually increases block size.  But if we do not do so another hard fork is guaranteed.

1.  It does not exist yet.
2. It will require 20MB blocks anyway for global scalability. 
3. It will have its own fees.
4. No one will run full nodes if they can't issue txns on the blockchain anyway.  So bitcoin will become even more centralized with lightning network than with 20MB blocks.
5. You lose all kinds of features like asset tracking (colored coins), proof of existence etc.

You are right i would absolutely have a wad of euros or better USD and a small stockpile of essentials.  But typically when a country issues a new currency it makes trade in the old illegal.  This will be weird given the euros use elsewhere so it's impossible to know what strategy will be used.  Perhaps just use of physical Euros within greece will be outlawed.  Of course you'll have a chance to change them to drachmas.  You'll bring them to an office and they'll stamp the bills with an indelible red ink like Hawaii WW2.
It's awkward that you can tell the source of the euro just by glancing at the serial number.  It would be unfortunate for greece if the ecb declares the Y notes not legal tender and gives people in other countries a week to change any notes that left your shores.  They may do this if they decide that Greece CANT go officially bankrupt so they attempt to reclaim value.  
Of course your euro denominated international bank accounts are perfectly accessible since they know your identity.  All greek owned accounts in euro countries will possibly be frozen and then converted to drachma.  The greek govt wants this to increase drachma value.  The EU wants it to pay the loan.
None of the above is very likely.  But something is going to happen and it WON'T BE PRETTY.  Its best to prepare for the worst.

Right like github.  But not the part where I sell some appcoins I earned to joe for $50.  At least not without the extensive financial infrastructure companies use today to track share ownership.

Yes you can't force the centralized power to disburse profits.  But if they DO choose to disburse you can insist on getting your share.  This is why employee startup stock options work.

I've considered doing similar just by analyzing github commits and splitting profits according to contributions.  No blockchain needed.

The real advantage here is probably fees.  For example there's an extra 1 or 2 dollar CC processing fee to renew car online in NH.  And once you have BTC its extremely convenient to pay online with it... esp. For once a year txns which wont be keeping your CC on file like Amazon does.

Well banks are national.   This company would need to be local.  But u are right about balls of steel for any company in this space.

Let's also hold the distinction between regulation and enforcement.  Regulation attempts to stop crimes before they happen and has a terrible track record in finance of failure to stop crimes and inconvenience to law abiding companies.  However I do not think that many believe that pirateat40 or karpeles should walk free.

Except no income tax in NH so I guess its you who are making no sense...

How will they prove that every digital dollar is backed by a USD?

They wont of course b/c the eventual point will be to inflate like all fiat currency.   But it would still be awesome because it would allow atomic (or nearly so) transfer between BTC and bank supported fiat.

This bill says nothing about the state holding bitcoin.  So by default there will likely be conversion to dollars.  That aspect is not relevant to this bill.

Bank xfer is pretty inconvenient.  I'd support this same bill if Paypal replaced BTC but I'd prefer BTC for its ease of use and low txn fees.
