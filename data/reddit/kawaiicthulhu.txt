The problem is that we're already dealing with fractions of millibits for small transactions.
@_date: 2014-03-14 07:02:41
I don't get it.  You're complaining that we'll just have to do it all over again, and yet you favour switching to the millibit?  The point of going straight to the mic is that it'll spare us one iteration of this process.
@_date: 2014-03-14 06:52:36
It'll be too open to confusion.  The millibit has already surpassed the value of the dollar once, and it may not be long before the microbit  approaches the value of the cent.  I say we make the switch once, to mics.  By the time we need to use even smaller units, bitcoin will be widely used and understood the world over.

I didn't say anything was certain.  Bitcoin could crash and burn for all I know, and I'm prepared for it to do so.  But I'm betting it won't.

But what proportion of bitcoiners are subbed to @_date: 2014-12-18 09:14:32


It lost 80% of it's value last year and recovered just fine.  Sure it did it over a shorter time frame, but we're not at any breakpoint just yet - we're still sitting above the 3-year support line.  It appears to me that we're just working a 2-year bubble out of our system.  Get back to me when we're sub-$200.  Until then, I'm going to sit back and enjoy all the panic  and gloom of this despair phase.

Yeah, no.  A lot of Reddit users, most probably a *large majority*, don't even register.  And that would apply to bitcoiners too.

So US police don't kill dozens of times more civilians per capita than Western Europe, and doesn't have the highest incarceration in the world?  
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:40:49
Flaws ... like your grammar.
@_date: 2015-05-09 07:27:51
One chance in a hundred billion?  Yeah, nah the chance of being killed by US cops is *vastly* higher than that.  And incarceration means imprisonment.

So you're saying that each LA resident uses over $250 of power a day?  Please.
@_date: 2018-11-06 09:35:24
The population of LA is some 13 million.  Are you saying that each person there uses almost $2 of power ever 10 mins?
@_date: 2018-11-08 22:41:52
Source?  Because that's higher than the entire GDP of LA.

No mention of Bitcoin, downvoted.

Telling someone to shut up isn't censorship.  Preventing them from saying stuff or removing what they say is censorship.

I could tell you, but ... you know.

You could feed yourself for a month just about anywhere in the world, as long as you're not allergic to beans.

It's not just that.  Banks make *everyone* suffer, aside from the bankers and the banks' owners.  
The hideous beauty of the banking system is that the slaves auction *themselves*.  Those who take on more debt can buy the house.  But even those who can't or won't take on the debt have to pay exorbitantly inflated rents to those who *do* buy the house.  Because prices just bubble to ridiculous levels, vastly higher than they would be if owners had to buy their properties outright.
