Interesting I’ll check it out.

I'm too new to Reddit myself to adequately explain it. Basically it's like points for comments to show that you are not just a spammer or troll I think. 
You can join subs that have no restrictions on minimum karma to post, and earn karma by adding to the discussions there. 
There are also account age minimums, so you might have to wait 10 days to post in certain subs. 
I recommend reading some of the new user guides and FAQs on Reddit. They are really helpful!

Confession. It was me too. I bought yesterday because my baby daddy has bad FOMO. I said, no let's wait it'll be down again tomorrow..but no. Bought last night. (It was his money, so his call)
So of course price drops like 1K immediately after lol.

I would sell one to pay of credit card debt. That's usually pretty high interest rates. 
If I only have one BTC, I'd hang on to that for a long while yet!

I hear you! I only just tonight got my funds available, so I'm looking at $14K CAD instead of like $8K when it was so much lower. I could wait for another dip/crash, but I'm still new and scared that it'll never go below today's price again lol. I suffer from the FOMO too my friend.

I agree. It's not a scam at all.. but they are really REALLY struggling when it comes to customer support.

Probably because your account is too new to let you post. Usually you require certain amounts of karma to post in many subs.

I think I read in their TOS that it can take up to 60 days because of the financial institution that is the intermediary between cex.io and the banks we use. How long has it been since you initiated the transfer?

Yeah I don't know, that was my best guess. Maybe the moderators deleted your posts because they were in contravention of the sub rules?
