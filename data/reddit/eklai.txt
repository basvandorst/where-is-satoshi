I never said he gave away his identity here. Information adds up is what I am saying.  Maybe look up his username, or look for information about location, and work, on his history.  Is his username their business? You know they have search engines for public use, let alone needing any hacking skills.  They had username search engine that linked to my old myspace profile.  I went from one old username to my address, photos, school, email, family members, all known. And that is without any hacking skills in use or paying for full reports. Just “google” it, then search for yourself using some criteria in multiple search engines.  Some focus on usernames, some on names.
Why give those that indeed would want that 70k a little bit more to work with?
If I was a hacker, i’d look into anyone’s profile that claimed to have this much.  Because why, if your hungry, would you not follow the breadcrumbs?
People know more than you think, anyway.
Edit- just a “why?”  Boasting on reddit about your btc.. and the severity lessens if you don’t have social media, etc etc... but just... why?

A lot of sharp minds working for progress.
@_date: 2018-09-26 01:56:38
Mmm okay. Yeah, I get that..
Edit- Dreamt I bought pizza with btc yesterday.

Do you think it is wise to share this information on the internet?

It depends. 
If you’re looking to trade on the regular, keeping some in your exchange and some in your decentralized wallet would’ve fine, just in case, whatever you’re not trading should be kept safe.
If you are a holder, or hodl, like someone investing long term, than putting it in your wallet is a must imo.  
Exchanges are centralized businesses, and your wallet is the safer place.

“100 FREE acceleration per hour
By order of submission, ViaBTC supports acceleration of 100 FREE transactions per hour.
Please resubmit your TXID at next new hour (e.g. 13:00 sharp) if it surpasses the hourly limit.” 
That’s handy to know.

Illegal to trade ccs in the current country I am living in.  They fear CCs would bring down the newly built, already falling apart stock market(just recently turned electronic for the first time!)   It would take a while, but I agree.  Holding for a better tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-11-27 06:59:06
Same!  Looking forward to the future of things.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:35:01
Nice, and logic based. Thanks for sharing!

It’s unfortunate that people don’t understand this.

The country I am living in atm has banned urban dictionary apparently.  Illegal to trade Crypto here, too.  Communism from the outside while being in is an odd experience.  Can you tell me the word?  
Edit- communist methods*

Don’t seek financial advice here, friend. These folks are all over the place.  I’m not a professional so I’m mot saying anything, but... i’m holding on or my relatively small investment is going down with the ship.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:38:02
Only 4,400 on Coinbase rn.

Within us all is that investor saying the same thing.

I bought some @ 4,800 because I didn’t think it would get this low.  Waiting to buy more this time.
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:09:15
You could trace back any idea to the first thought that was thought up.

But some believe in the purpose of Bitcoin not as an investment for financial purposes but rather a societal, personal investment.  So you’re right that it is sometimes emotional. And i’m not saying that Bitcoin holders wouldn’t mind making more than they spend one day- but it’s not always as shallow as a strict financial investment. 
There is no need to apologize, you just don’t understand every single other person’s perspective, and that’s okay.
I’m a poor man, with forty dollars to my name, complete. But a happy one, and with my fifteen dollars worth of bitcoin I don’t expect to make even up to twenty.  But i’m holding them for a very, very long time. 
Sometimes it’s not always about the profit, friend.
After a few months when I return back to the US and am giving my return-salary... i’ll be sure to be holding even more.  If one day I profit- that’d be a great!  What means even more to me is that Bitcoin was a success.   
Fuck the banks. c: 
I just realized that almost 40% of my finances are in the form of bitcoin.  Nice!

Hey thanks! I would have made over 2 million. Build my own little Animal Sanctuary, rescue a few dogs. Nice lady, small mountain home. Big ol garden. Buy welding equipment.  Make metal art.. Sell for BTC. Hehe, someday.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:11:53
Get what ya pay for!  Just checked again, 3 confirmations. I’ll wait it out for a day. Cheers.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:27:02
You’re asking for opinions, not facts.  I say it’ll drop to 3.5 or 4k.
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:19:46
A fine addition.
@_date: 2018-11-18 10:10:32
So what let it drop, buy up while its low.
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:51:47
Checked again, it actually has “-3” confirmations.  Coinbase says over 50,000 confirmations (really), but they were transferred to my wallet successfully.. soo.. done, I guess? Weird, though.
@_date: 2018-11-22 07:30:45
Just making sure folks understand this haha- a lot of people are saying a lot of bs for the sake of causing a ruckus.

Just want to throw out a quick, “it’ll be all right.”  Whether it is devastating for you or it ends up on a brighter side.  It’s not the only value you posses.  You’ll bounce back one day, promise.  Don’t worry bitcoin.  I’m still here for you.

As long as you don’t have family, best of luck.

I guess I could use an accelerator but if I’m not in a rush then there isn’t a reason.. just stressful to have funds in this state.
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:08:02
It said, “Surprise, NO BITCOIN.”
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:05:35
Oh totally.  Gambling for a cause I believe in, if I make a buck that’d be great.  “Pull this lever and you may help tell global powers you want to have your money. Not them.”  I’d invest/gamble in that!

I’ll have to reassess the cc sector after seven months or so when I get paid. Until then I am on a 5 dollars a day stipend in another country.  Had to battle Coinbase to accept my American citizenship since it’s illegal to trade cc’s here. All of the IDs, haha! I appreciate the security, though- considering my IP is from a “country of concern.”
Thanks for the tip and best of luck.  Sticking your neck out like that here, means a lot :D
Edit- Ah- Stocks!  I misunderstood. Haha I was very doubtful.
