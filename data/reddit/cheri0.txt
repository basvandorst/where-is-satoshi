I think that's happened because they are scared about MtGox becoming bankrupt. If it will die people will lose great amount of money.

Interesting indeed. I think we've proven/provided lessons learned when it comes time for mainstream adoption

Have two different thoughts about this:
1) It should have a PR Dept as it is a big company
2) If they really have PR Debt - why do they wok so bad?

That's why I want to educate people about bitcoins so this number will grow

Well said.
PayPal hates credit cards...just a major way to lose cash.

One of the main selling points of Bitcoin is its open ledger, where anyone can see every transaction that's ever been made. It might be pseudonymous to a certain extent, but it's more transparent than the fiat banking system.

If bitcoin is a scam, it only learned from fiat. Legal theft of assets trough limitless printig....let's talk about scam...

Is it better now?
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:17:24
Yeah, and less popularity of crypto. Guys on [BTCWiki subreddit]( run hot debates about it, pretty interesting to take part
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:27:50
you should share your predictions in the btcwiki subreddit :D there people discuss today the future of bitcoin. Such predictions they didn't hear yet I think :)
@_date: 2018-03-27 17:21:20
Same shit happened with Twitter. Why do you think it happens? Guys on [BTCWiki subreddit]( say interesting things about all that stuff
