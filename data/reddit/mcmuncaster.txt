just venture over to r/btc, there seems to be more innovation on that side of the conversation

@_date: 2018-05-06 19:43:17
no you don't - it's a faucet, you just need a BCH address. 
these used to exist in BTC back when transaction fees were low and payment was instant (before RBF)
I use faucets to get people into crypto...because they can get started instamtly

It's a little sad that you are suggesting that Twitter be the arbiter of the Bitcoin name. That's called censorship - and if you want Twitter to do that, then you also can't complain if they take it away from you and give ownership to Donald Trump.
This Bitcoin community is screaming because they want to censor...that's both sad and ironic

Of course he can do what he wants, just like bitcoin.com can label bch cash as bitcoin, and btc bitcoin core - because it's their site.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:40:50
Horrible call dude. Your site describes a shitcoin as one that has no value. You may very well disagree with BCH, you may disagree with bitcoin.com's reference to 'bitcoin core' - but you are pegging a 'fraud' lable to something that you disagree with. You've taken the  coin by market cap (2nd largest by accumulated POW) and compared it to a ponzi scheme (bitconnect)....my god you don't even label Ethereum Classic as a shitcoin?
BCH is massively growing in merchant adoption, and massively growing in use cases (e.g memo.cash).
To your 'but bitcoin.com is intentionally adding confusion' argument:
Let's consider I, Robert, create a website called "USdollars.com". Great, and when you go to "buy.usdollars.com" I offer that you can buy "fakecoins" or "realcoins". When you purchase fakecoins I sent you physical dimes and nickles, but when you buy realcoins really I just sold you some bitcoin (BTC). 
You could get upset with me over that, some people would, I might get sued. 
Now - according to your logic, coincall should lable BTC a shitcoin because I (an individual) am "intentionally trying to confuse the community by taking over usdollar.com,  twitter handle and much more"
So what is coincall guilty of? Continuing to fuel this religious battle instead of just allowing the market be the market
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:09:44
bitcoin.com is owned by a company, and should not be confused with bitcoin cash. BCH is a coin backed by a community who believe in the continued vision of the WP, many who were those pushing BTC back when it was 5cents, some who were very early developers (Such as Gavin A among others)
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:20:52
That's fine, and I don't disagree - but I'm highlighting that 5EH/s is so much higher then any other coin, it's 5X that of BTC at the time of the fork (Aug 1) and it's only been 9 months.
My point is made, miners have clearly gotten behind it, it's not some coin with 8 full nodes in somebody's basement like your chicken nugget coin example. 
Love it or hate it I don't care, but it has surely gotten past the stage when people considered it a scamcoin, sure back in Aug/Sept people were convinced it would go to zero, but we're kind of past that now
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:35:27
but you are hoping for censorship - you want twitter to weigh in on a civil war - that is not their place. 
market forces such as user and merchant adoption are driving the price higher. 
what will BTC advocates cry after the flipening? there is only so much you can blame Roger for, but the stagnation of BTC is kind of spearheaded by blockstream
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:03:28
If you forked, you would have your node as the first full node, and whatever hash power you have for that. 2 S9s mining your brand spanking new coin would give you 30TH/s
BCH has 5 EH/s - that's nothing to sneeze at.

@_date: 2019-03-29 15:18:49
bch hasn't failed - but I do appreciate the straw man you threw out for what it is
\- Business should not have to worry about how to combine their transactions. If they have to do this, they won't. Sure, crypto businesses might, not others
\- segwit barely makes a dent
When there's a tx backlog long enough - fees will return, waiting several hours for a confirmation is as bad as fees, and those 2 crummy user experiences oscillate between each other

thanks for your patience
@_date: 2019-03-29 19:58:05
You know that your phrase can be reworded the same for BTC/BCH right? BTC split in two, two different philosophies - two camps. And the biggest boon for BCH was the failed 2X (which showed how dishonest core developers were FTW). 2X could have kept most of the community together but the moron blockstream folks....well...any other words?
The hash war was was completely pointless - but that's not why there was a split. CSW wanted his own coin, full stop.
The price of BTC has collapsed, and no one uses that.
Not sure why the future is so bright? I still see scaling as a problem - there's zero adoption and the network is already congested....that's kind of bad and the opposite of bright.
I will concede the split was terribly ironic
@_date: 2019-03-17 01:42:05
Since 2017: 
\- USD has lost about 1% of its value
\- BTC has lost about 85% of its value

I've thought of this problem at length and I'm trying to understand the value - particularily as it relates to IoT. If every device will be connected to the internet, then why isn't the device accepting payment just connected to the internet validating payment? If access to mobile is not feasible, then how could the payer make the payment? (clearly mobile must be accessible for the person making the payment).
I can't see how this could be any benefit over the device just accepting SPV with it's own trusted remote node?

If you purchased from an exchange with KYC, which to the best of my knowledge all that accept fiat do - then literally every single transaction you've made can be traced to you.  Once you take posession of your coins you can coinjoin, or shapeshift (now with KYC!) all you want and try to hide them but the IRS gets to know your entry from fiat so don't play games or you can get really screwed. ... 
If you use something like hodlhodl or localbitcoins (now with KYC!) Then there's no public or centrally known entity for the government/IRS to know that you are in crypto. ...same if you mine and participate in a pool with no KYC (which is most), those are not tainted yet by big data big state big privacy stealing. However, just like a bag with 20M showing up on your doorstep, You start spending that in any meaningful way like a house or sports car, or even deposit into a fiat system like an exchange, then suddenly the eye of soron will find you and you need to start watching ozark to learn how to clean your money.

I can't for the life of me find on the site bitcoin is referring to bch? I see "bitcoin core" and "bitcoin cash" everywhere.
If I click on "buy Bitcoin" the first thing that comes up is "Buy Bitcoin Cash / Buy Bitcoin Core"
My bitcoin app has "bitcoin core" and "bitcoin cash"
Seems to me they only qualify between the 2 versions of bitcoin instead of assuming the 1? Like buying dollars becomes "buy Canadian Dollar / buy United States Dollar"
What exactly is the issue here? 
@_date: 2018-04-09 02:48:55
today, sure. 
however; average number of transactions per block plummeted after it hit peak congestion in December... when fees hit well over 40$ per transaction. 
the narrative dies once bitcoin scales on chain. it proved it clearly doesn't scale and can't handle any more merchant adoption

@_date: 2018-04-19 14:11:13
that is the argument for centralization: I can't manage my own security so they need to be paternalistic and protect me. 
hackers don't care about me, they want the entire exchange.  my fear is the exchange being hacked, the exchange has poor controls and now my passport, address, etc... all get sold on the black market.  I am liable for identity theft, my credit gets screwed, I am liable for debts incurred.
I don't trust central authorities with my PII. I want to pay with crypto because I don't trust merchants not to sell my CC info. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:00:39
Personally if I wanted to buy "bitcoin" and I saw 2 options "bitcoin cash / bitcoin core" - you'd better believe that I would google "difference between bitcoin cash and bitcoin core" before ever buying it. I don't think this makes me a genius, just someone who notices I'm buying something different then the name I originally intended
The first result I get is actually from bitcoin.com which is a very good and transparent article - I don't find it duplicitous.
Next: It actually takes a much more savvy person to purchase bitcoin because you need a wallet. Most people who have very little knowledge would feel much more safe with an exchange. 
At the very worst - they purchase BCH when intending to purchase BTC. It's not like they lost their money, they can convert it very easily since the network is very liquid. They may incur a loss, they may incur a gain. Most people always start small with something new in order to educate themselves. If they incur a significant loss then they paid for education, which is the most valuable investment. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:25:46
to be fair - I use bitcoin cash more often to transact because of the fees.
you draw the "bitcoin cash is controlled by bitmain" straw man without including the "bitcoin is controlled by blockstream" equivalent argument.
my personal belief: scaling requires both on chain and off chain scaling - the move away from segwit2X was a disservice to bitcoin.
my only real issue with bitcoin cash is not the vision or roadmap - it's the fragmentation the split caused in the community. Incredible animosity on both sides, and this will spook adoption because it confuses the lay-person. ironically - bitcoin cash also introduces the problem that cryptocurrency hopes to solve, centralization. instead of governments or banks deciding the fate of a currency, a handful of developers do (through forced hard forks)
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:40:54
exchanges today do play a pivotal role in offloading some of the scaling burden with off chain transactions.
though I do agree that I would prefer a decentralized exchange - even though it would go through a period of bugs, etc... just like I prefer bitcoin
exchanges take too much personal data, and the controls on how they store that data are largely unregulated... they are perfect targets to be hacked, especially smaller ones that have small IT
