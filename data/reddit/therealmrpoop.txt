“challenges the underlying security model”
The underlying security model of Bitcoin is decentralization. This might validate the idea that the clues are central in this image. 
“The work reflects on the elements that brought this technology to life.”
Not sure what to make of that hint. What are the elements? Satoshis? Blocks? Contributions from earlier attempts at cryptocurrency? 
Seems likely that this hint might help with the ordering of the seed words in the center of the image.

But seriously...what do you think will be the catalyst for this change? In this sub? In mainstream media?

But which will drop at a greater rate if the dollar is in crisis? It's all relative.

I might have miscommunicated the question. I am certainly not suggesting that we (on this sub or more broadly) should be pricing things in btc at this point in time. We live in a dollar based economy and btc is a drop in the bucket. 
Just curious what creative scenarios people could think of that might trigger a change in how we perceive and talk about value.  Like 10 years from now the widely accepted crypto-dollar gets compromised by a 14 year old and nations start adopting btc for international trade.

Reasonable. With all the "cheap" money introduced into the system through QE and low discount rates it seems likely that things will change once money becomes more costly to borrow. People may then realize how much REAL inflation has occurred over the last decade and look for an alternative.
