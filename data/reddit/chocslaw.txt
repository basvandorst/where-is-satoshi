I mean it can still be viewed as an investment, albeit a highly speculative one.  If you've really dug into the technology, understand and have weighted the risks then sure it could be a worthwhile gamble.   However, that puts you in a small minority.  Most have not.  For most people in BTC this is no different than a pull of the handle at the slot machines.

Because the topic has been debated ad nauseam over the past month?  Up to everyone and their brother creating a topic crying about it.    
No will deny that it is an issue that needs to be addressed.  And there are numerous examples of how it could and probably will be addressed.   But it isn't going to happen over night.   This is all new technology being developed and it is going to have the growing pains to go along with it.  Some ideas for BTC are new, some are ideas that some other coin may have already simply because it's much easier to implement new features on things that nobody uses or cares about.   
If you are not prepared to ride out the roller-coaster for the next decade or more, then being an early adopter of any crypo (or one of the undoubtedly thousands of block-chain techs coming out in the near future) is probably not something you want to be a part of.

The problem is not knowing it is a bubble, but knowing where it ends.  If you can't stay solvent long enough to see it come to fruition, then it doesn't matter.   
Short selling will require margin, which will magnify your gains and losses.  It also means if the price moves against you enough the position will automatically be closed.  It's not you can just sit through it and wait.  And the higher the margin, the small the window.

It's been in a bull market the past 2 years and you're seeing the frenzied nonsensical culmination of the peak.   You see everyone chanting hold.  But inside a large majority are looking at the current price and getting nervous.

That fear will continue to build until it something triggers an initial wave of sells, then its game over for most of these lads.

The block-chain technology is certainly a useful technology that will see many uses in the future.   All that other stuff is unicorns and rainbows.    
1) It's a terrible store of wealth.  A store of wealth don't constantly fluctuate by 10-30%.   It's only seen as a store of wealth now because it's going up so that's the new battle cry.  No one was saying that shit back in 2014 (and certainly not in 2015), it was all about CURRENCY CURRENCY CURRENCY.   But now its kind of a shit currency that nobody can use so we're on this "store of wealth" kick. Butbutbutbutbutbut it will be one one day in 2100 when its stable and the world has fully adopted it... um, ok  
2) It's a bank.. I'm not even sure how to respond to that.  Were you being serious?  
3) It's scores pretty awful in every aspect that makes a currency, so it's a pretty awful currency  
4) It's a commodity.  I would agree with this more than the others.

@_date: 2017-12-19 15:09:15
Spending makes the world go round.  People encouraged to simply hoard their money and not put it to productive (or frivolous in the case of most people) use is bad news bears.  See the US circa 1930s.   Which was a time when the currency was backed by commodity, reducing its ability to expand and stimulate economic growth.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:49
Until it shoots up even more and the dip is above where you sold.  Trying to call tops and bottoms is a fools game
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:41:29
Which is ultimately dangerous for those that see BTC rise as some wise "investment" they made.  Because that will positively re-enforce the idea that it wasn't chance that they ultimately made a profit.  Many of whom will most likely go on to lose most (or all and then some) of the gains trying to bet on the next big thing, because they have some special insight that gives them an edge.  Because after seeing your money grow 10x, 100x, 1000x in a couple of years, it makes 10-20% per year seem laughable in comparison. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:46:59
We can say that growth would have eventually stalled, which it did.
The only way to have spurred economic grow at that point would be to resort to acquiring more of the commodity that back the currency,  most likely by force.  Or constantly reducing the amount of commodity needed for for the amount of currency in circulation.  And at some point it’s backed by such a negligible amount it doesn’t even matter.  
You can’t have a limited supply currency. Especially in a society that has an ever growing population.  Individuals will accumulate it and the population will rise. Each individual has access to a smaller and smaller piece of the available currency.  The value rises,  people want to accumulate more and more which causes the amount in circulation to shrink even more.

@_date: 2017-12-19 16:42:50
Most people lived like shit back then, so a stable currency did little for them.   The limited currency supply was held by a small minority.  You saw this decrease somewhat into the early 1900s, but it was mainly the rising usage of credit. See the 1930s for what happens when that house of cards gets shaken.  And when it was, there was no way to infuse the economy with enough money to keep it going while things got sorted out.  Hence, the freeze up.
It's amazing you guys preach about breaking the wealth inequality of today's society by going back to a system that promotes it.

Yeah and next year is the gonna be the year of Linux desktop because it would allow people so much more flexibility if they would just learn it.   
There's a big difference between what should be and what is.   Most people should care about and have a deeper understanding of a lot of things, but they don't.  They don't care how it works, as long as it works and they don't have to worry about it.   Most people can just barely turn a computer on and find their way around it.  And you expect them to worry about protecting their wallet, backing up their keys, etc?   Oh there are hardware wallets.  That's nice, you expect people to carry around their entire worth in a wallet they'll probably lose at some point?   Oh they really should use a cold storage wallet for that?... See where this is going?
The BTC community seems to have a fundamental paradox in what it wants.  If you want BTC to become mainstream and force for change; then along with it comes centralization, regulation, and making it effortless to use.   You won't be getting mass adoption without those things.  Saying no to all that means something else will take its place and BTC itself becomes ultimately worthless.

So you disagreed with the direction Core was going, fair enough.  Then proceeded brand it extremely similar the original and go about marketing in such ways as to make it as confusing as possible for anyone that doesn't have much knowledge on the situations. 
This is basically an engineer at Red Hat saying he doesn't think their philosophy matches that of Linux anymore; so he goes out forks Read Hat Linux and names it Red Hat Linux OS.  Then tries to sell everyone that will listen how this is the true Red Hat because it follows the original Linux philosophy better.   People do fork it, but at least they have the balls to name it something unique and let it attempt to stand on its own two feet.   The only difference here is you didn't have to worry about a copyrighted brand, so you could do whatever you wanted.

He doesn't mean Bitcoin won't end well.  He means it won't end well for most of the early "investors",  i.e. most of the people getting caught up in the hype, buying high and selling low.   It hasn't and it won't.

Then you don't understand him or his methodology.   He has studied and practiced the art of reducing risk and employing capital to achieve the highest returns possible since he was 10 years old and he is the most accomplished person in this field in our lifetimes, if not longer.  
He has passed up many opportunities that don't fit within his ability to understand them.  Some of which have turned out to be great ones, the majority where ones that caused people to lose everything.

It was in a bubble, it did pop, and lots of people lost a lot of money trying to jump on the train.    Now he says it's not investing, it's gambling/speculation.  It is speculation at this point.   No one can tell you a true value for it.  Will it go up, down, disappear in 5-10 years?  No one knows for sure.  
Bitcoin in its current state is not safe or usable by the masses.   It's made great advances and maybe one day it will be.   Millions of people look to him for advice and for those not willing to do their own research then his approach is exactly what they should be following.

But to answer your question you can check the hash rates on current video cards here: 
There are several caculators online that will allow you to put in your estimated hashrate, power consumption, etc and give you the profitability of your setup.  One possibility is: 
There are several programs out now (guiminer, cgminer) that making mining relatively simple.  If you dont have much hardware experience, you would need to do some research on the type of setup you would like to run.  It really just depends on how many video cards you are looking to go with.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:36:56
And do you think that this transferring of dollars to BTC or vice verse will be free?  Most exchanges and services are already charging fees, albeit much lower than your normal card fees etc.  But as long as you have a middle man involved, greed is gonna eventually trump any kind of belief in the bitcoin fundamentals.
I think what you will see as these companies providing these services start to grow and incur more cost is that their fees are going to rise accordingly.  Right now you basically have a bunch of services thrown together with some arbitrary fee schedule that don't make much sense.  My thoughts are they have yet to run into any risk or underwriting issues. 
But you are currently correct and we really don't know how this will play out in the future.  It is fun to theory craft though.

Bitcoin will most likely never be stable enough for large economic consumption unless some types of checks and balances are put into place.
