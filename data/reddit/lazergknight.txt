Dumb idea, He could lose all of that money if the market goes on a bear run, not to mention he will owe a decent amount of interest by the end of the loan. Everyone on this forum will tell you this is generally a bad idea. Not that the odds are the same or that this is even a comparable analogy, but would you take out a loan to play a hand a blackjack?

With the shift card from coinbase when you swipe your card a conversion is instantly done from bitcoin to cash when swiping, so there is no "loading" bitcoin onto it to receive a cash balance, to me that's a major perk.

Can't stress this enough! I thought the same thing as op with bcash, but money sitting on the sidelines could've earned me a lot more if I would've just pulled the trigger.

Sigh, I'm 100% sure I'm updated to the most recent version of bread and I don't see this feature when following the instructions on the blog post. Anyone else having this issue?

You should look into NAVs Dual blockchain approach to anon transactions. the transaction would be btc&gt;nav&gt;nav&gt;btc. However if someone really wanted they could find that entry point, such is the nature of btc.

As a 23 year old man I'll gladly say ~75% of my net worth is in crypto. Don't have much of a net worth without outside of my commuter car, I rent an apartment, and pretty much have everything I need. This being said of course i have an emergency fund set into place, and I've tried to make my crypto incredibly accessible if I need it (shift card from coinbase I could transfer btc to and have cash for the ATM across the street in a moments notice). This probably is not the safest option, but I don't think I could ever talk myself into selling on a dip even if I tried, and my gains have been much larger than the ~1% interest my credit union gives me.

You sold them bud �� math checks out hard. Let this be a lesson like everyone else said, better to burn 300usd than 3000.
