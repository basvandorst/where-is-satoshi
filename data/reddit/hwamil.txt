This is a pretty big move! Good for Florida.
And taxes means it is going to get even more legitimate image compared to the drugs and crime image many people have of Bitcoin.

and cash wasn't?

I mean the sign literally said 19% fees is fair and Protect Wells Fargo. 
There's no way this can be real.

Bitcoin is exciting next-gen technology and stocks are boring. 
This perception helps bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:46:37
How much time does that take though?
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:39:32
We will have even lower fees and now Bcash has no reason to exist!

That means someone's going to have to take that job and then btc might become de-decentralized? idk. haven't slept.

You're on drugs, son. Not that that's bad or anything, but saying things that implicate certain stuff isn't the right thing to do.

Come on, man. It's not *that* much money. It'll be fun.

Hopefully when the hoarders finally cash in and become filthy rich they'll invest in developing technologies to make bitcoining easier while being 99.9% secure.

I have a good chance of becoming a successful person in the future (legitimately, of course). You don't know me and you don't quite understand what I'm capable of but if you give me $800 right now I'll make sure to pay you back with a very good interest some time later.

I need money to go to grad school so obviously my needs should be more of a priority for people than your needs, undergraduate punk.
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:17:25
..remove it from the digital scene so it doesn't get hacked????

Well, I can say for sure your debt will still exist. It'll be a long time until crypto currency phases out fiat. Until then bitcoins (and any other digital currency) will only represent fiat as no-border transaction method.
edit: that is the core merit of bitcoins: anonymity, fast, and no fees attached. freedom as fuck. but you're old chains, if they exist, will still hold you down.
eidt: if anything, your debt will be collected in bitcoins.

Don't do it. Find someone else. You probably chose this guy because his prices were good. Well, good prices come with a price: NEGATIVE PRICE

"I spent $800 for pure, no-expectations-attached, carefree, innocent FUN!"
Fuck this person.

No, but I'm worried that some poor sap will fall for it.

Sorry, but I chuckled when he almost said American Jujitsu System.

if bitcoin wallets can be saved on my phone only accessible by my unique fingerprint algorithm, that'd be sweet. Just place my finger, use iWallet to buy some bitcoins and then use them to buy/send overseas.

You're thinking short terms. Eventually, with the difficulty rising with no profitable return, a chunk of the miners will leave or *have to* leave.
