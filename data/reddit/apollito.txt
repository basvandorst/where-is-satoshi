Actually in the market for a new phone.  What do you suggest?

Right so we shouldn't promote breathing because Cosby is doing it.

My analogy was not make light of it, it was to demonstrate that the action of buying bitcoin isn't glorifying the wierdo.    
       
Then you felt the need to state a truly ridiculous statement and say that I somehow have a positive attitude about him, which deep down I don't think you believe.    
      
Argue with your head, not your emotions.  I bear no ill will towards you though.  Cheers!

Fully agreed.  Apparently I need to clarify that.

And here we go with with the typical false accusations and ad hominems that this generation resorts to.       
      
No one is promoting him, they are promoting the action of buying bitcoin.  The point is that someone famous (infamous) caused bitcoin related news, which is publicity.  It could have been the fucking Mexican drug cartel and people would have posted this.      
       
But no you just think that I agree with men that abuse women.  That is the connection you made.  Perhaps you just said that to hinder my point.  You either missed the point or intentionally accused me of something which I am not to make my opinion less valid.  In either case, not a good look.

Over, i think the support there is quite strong, but I don't know what I'm talking about.

Where to begin? Lets start with the definition of rob: unlawful taking of one's property by threat or  force.  If a rich person does that its not business its a crime and would be punished as such.   
Definitions aside, this also implies that that any time a rich person robs a poor person, including gunpoint theft, it would be considered business. Blatant fallacy of inclusion if you are familiar with philosophical fallacies.   
Next and simply, yes any time someone fights its considered violence, rich or poor.       
Lastly and the most importantly, despite of all this nonsense, the quote still tries to create anger and division between classes.  Hence it is an irresponsible use or a poor argument to instill some kind of hatred.

You seem to be focusing on the issues with the justice system which is a completely different topic. No unlawful extortion of the poor would get ruled as business, it would get handled as a crime. On the second point, violence is always violence.

What a terrible, irresponsible quote.
