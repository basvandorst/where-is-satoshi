1) auction site (e.g. Ebay) use bitcoin not just for paying but some form of identity, and escrow, and protecting buyers/sellers, some reputation base that is locked to the blockchain (solving the problems in Ebay)  
2) sending payment to an email address ala Paypal but bitcoin instead
That's all. Thanks for reading!

Sorry to hear this predicament. Hope whatever amount in bitcoins left can cover, in the months to come.

Rhetorically, how about Gift Cards? Amazon Gift Card or Starbucks (is there one?), or say a "Danish Scandinavian Furniture Gift Card". Say you bought it in Denmark for $10. It was for fun. Was a hobby. Just a vacation and a souvenir so to speak.
After 6 months, you found for some weird reason, or not, in Ebay it is trading for $8000 dollars. How about it was a Norwegian pebble you found during a hiking trip in a fjord there? If was free, or it included the time, airfare, hiking equipment -to hike - so it costs $4500 USD for that pebble, but nobody wants it today? BUT again in Ebay in 2020, someone wants it for $8000 dollars. The question is not "do I pay tax" even that notion is driving people insane. 
If an alien race, came and saw us, they would be in shellshock to see this impossible concept of "pay tax on that pebble" or even the concept of tax. "Pay tax on that Infinity Stone, Dr. Strange."  
So vile, it isn't oxygen, which is vital to life. It's a created concept, that seemingly strikes extreme fear in a person (mainly USA citizen's) mind. It's tragic. They even have psychologist in every street corner. Those didn't exist in American in 1960s. 
The IRS or tax system micromanaging humanity is insane. And if people let it in their mind, the people goes insane too. Change the govt.

True!  
Though isn't it true, life is an adventure?   
And those caught in a 9-5 or matrix system, wants to get out, and enjoy the stone valley, the wooden wobbly chasm bridge, the kayaking rappelling challenge, the snowy rainy mountain trail?

2020. Kidnapped due to flaunting of wealth and the yellow car stolen.

It's fine. Life goes on. Banks still need bailout. 
People will suffer in the (around the corner) next financial crisis. Yawn.

No idea about tech, so assuming he is not even using smartphone, touch screen phones.
So could just go for: Bitcoin is a collector's coin, like vintage or antique, or collector's game card, or things certain groups of enthusiasts like to collect, buy, trade. Sometimes price may go up. Sometimes down. Some willing to pay more. Some collect hoping it will rise in a year. Some sell so they can buy other things like a new Yamaha guitar. Some willing to buy your 20 year old Yamaha guitar cos they see some value, in a seasoned guitar. Some prefer a new guitar, or different brand. But what matters is you want to sell at the right time your guitar to a right buyer. You won't want to sell to that guy who prefers another brand. Or prefers to pay you a low price. So that's about it.
