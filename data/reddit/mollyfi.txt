I don't even have bitcoin anymore, sold it all for other coins - but I feel the same way as you. This needs to get a lot worse before I actually start losing money.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:21:49
A lot of credit cards offer kickback or points for purchases. I've purchased some by credit card, and earned a lot of points by doing so. Of course I'm not stupid enough to use credit cards if I can't afford to pay it back right away, but as long as you're not doing that buying it by credit card can be a decent thing.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:57:51
Depends on your bank, I guess. I used a credit card on Coinbase that gave me 2% kickback. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 12:00:42
Yeah, that's not the type of kickback I get. I get a certain percentage of whatever I buy. When I was going to buy the coins regardless, why not use a credit card to do so? I transfer money straight away into the credit card-account, so no interest. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:11:42
Oh, come on - everyone can see that buying an extremely expensive car is a very poor financial choice unless you already have everything else sorted out. It's just nuts. If my boyfriend bought a $100 000 car instead of paying his student loans or using the amount to help pay down a mortgage I would thing something was seriously wrong with him.
I'm not saying that OP has made a poor choice - for all I know he could be debt free. But there seems to be a couple too many on this sub with fresh / new money who *are* making some pretty poor choices. A car depreciates heavily in value. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:11:59
We have our own coins, thank you very much... 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:51:19
Still doesn't get you in there. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:31:19
You are seriously not understanding what I'm saying. A car is usually never an investment - so it can't be treated as one. I honestly give up on you - would never thing someone would be this daft. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:18:43
I've actually never experienced minimums except in the US (I'm sure they have it in some other countries as well, but not anywhere I've been). I guess in many other countries business owners factor in the cost in the price itself.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:00:50
I agree. I don't understand the fascination on this sub about buying *expensive* cars with earnings from BTC. A house - yes, or paying down one's mortgage or student loans - yes. But a car? In just a couple of years it's gonna have lost a lot of its value. My family had a $100 000 car - 10 years later I believe my parents sold it for around $10 000. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:24:57
Yeah I don't understand why anyone would risk not paying taxes. Taxes do a lot of good, even though the system definitely isn't perfect. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:27
Yeah. My comments have not been towards OP himself - none of us know anything about his situation. They were directed more towards the general "feel" I've gotten from this sub where quite a few have spent or wish to spend this much on a car *even when* they have other debt. But hey, to each their own. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:09:58
No, you're misunderstanding me. Buying a car is never an investment - or at least almost never. What I'm saying is that it is wise for many of us to keep losses due to depreciation at a minimum. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:17:34
No, I understand that. But that still doesn't make it very economical. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:19:23
Personally I would buy a safe and reliable car. Anything more than that makes little sense considering I have student loans. Then again - I don't need a car as I live in a city in Europe and public transportation is good. And yes, of course I have bought items that depreciate in value - cellphone, computer... but that depreciation cannot be compared to the depreciation one suffers when buying an expensive car. Yes, the iPad I bough three years ago isn't worth anything today, but that's a $200 loss. It's not a 50K - 70K loss. 
Again, I've never said that OP has made a poor choice. I don't know if he is debt free. But there are people here who are making and who will be making poor choices. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:26:06
Yes, this sub has had a huge focus on buying Teslas and Lambos. And no, I don't understand that. Why? It's not because it's wrong to buy them if you can afford it. It's because for most of us here on this sub we will never have enough earnings from BTC to get one. We might have enough to help pay down some loans or a mortgage, but not such expensive cars. I've seen a lot of car-posts here, and it does definitely not seem like all of those car buyers had made sure to pay down some other debt first. It's a financially poor choice for many of those people - and this sub shouldn't be about financially poor choices, but good ones. Why basically waste so much money if there are other things you should pay down first? And especially when most of those earnings will be gone due to loss of value in 10 - 12 years? 
I love seeing posts about people paying down student loans, buying a house or paying down a mortgage on here. I'm not a fan of posts like these. Having a fous on Teslas and Lambos just promotes poor choices. I've seen many of those in my life as well. My friends' boyfriends paying a lot of money for a car or a boat when the two of them can barely make ends meet every month - "because it's a hobby". 
If people have the money, and it's a financially sane choice (because you have little or no debt) then I don't see anything wrong with buying an expensive car. But it's not something we here on the sub should promote above everything else. Men are generally more impulsive than women, and it's easier for them to end up splurging on something they really shouldn't. 
My parents have a new expensive car now. It's okay that they do now, but it wasn't okay when they had their last one. They had other things they really should have paid off first, but now that everything is taken more or less care of they can of course spend their money however they want. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:11:33
Again - people can do whatever they want. If they enjoy it, then that's great. I'm just pointing out the fact that it might not be the best choice economically for a lot of us. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:18:20
No, I've never called a car an investment. You've been misunderstanding what I've been saying. It makes sense to take into account loss of value - that still doesn't mean I treat cars as investments. Cars are all losses. I'd rather buy a $10K car than a $20K car, but both cars will still be a loss in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:20:35
Of course - I'm not saying people can't do what they want. I'm just saying that if it were me I would focus *first* on paying down a mortgage and student loans. I wouldn't say no thank you to a nice car of course, but I'd prioritize differently. But the view on this might be something that differs between countries. When I lived in the US I saw a lot of people with pretty crappy living conditions that still had quite nice cars. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:12:36
People can do whatever they want, of course, but it's a poor economical choice unless one is already debt free or close to being debt free. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:01:54
I've never assumed anything about OPs debt. I was speaking generally. The fact of it is that most people *do* have debt - especially the younger generation. *If* one has debt, it makes zero sense to spend an extremely high amount on a car. 
And come on, you can't compare going on a yearly vacation with buying a car like this. A good vacation costs what, $2000? That's far, far away from the value of a car like this. Having debt doesn't mean you can't do anything fun or enjoyable. But *if* you have a decent amount of debt it makes zero sense to spend an amount like this on a car. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:09
Everything doesn't have to be an investment. I've never said that.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:29:46
You can't conclude from me showing how my parents' car depreciated that I believe everything should be an investment. Both a cheaper car and a more expensive one will lose value over time. But the loss is greater for the latter car than for the former. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:07:50
No, but could probably gotten better use of his money by (1) buying a cheaper car because cars lose a lot of value anyway, and (2) instead paying down the mortgage/student loan. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:30:56
How on earth are you going go get into Valhall. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:45:29
Ah come on, get real. People can buy expensive cars if they want to, I'm not saying that's wrong. I'm just saying that's not always the financially sane thing to do, which I think everybody would be able to see. Do you not see the difference between the massive loss of value a car like this will suffer, and going to the movies? Or buying clothes? I'm not sitting here saying that one has to live on a bare minimum and can never buy anything to enjoy oneself. Stop twisting my words. All I have said is that I hope nobody is doing things like this if they still have pretty high debt to pay. That would not be the financially sane thing to do.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:46:21
I give up on you. I cannot believe you are not understanding what I'm saying. A car is never an investment, but if you buy a *cheaper* car, the loss will be smaller. It's still not an investment - how can it be when there's a loss? Come on, don't be this daft. And no, I've never said that men are bad with finances. But it's true that they are more impulsive - and therefore it's *easier* for them to end up making bad choices.
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:17:50
Yeah, I had to do two. First my driver's license on Coinbase, and then I had to use my passport to start using Gdax. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:50:50
Please do tell me - how is buying a cheaper car an investment? It's still a loss. It's not as *big* of a loss, but nevertheless a loss. An investment is supposed to give you a benefit. Just because you're losing *less* money doesn't make it an investment. You're still going to end up having less than what you originally had. Now - how is something that is going to set you back financially *an investment*? I think you're the one that doesn't understand what an investment is. 
And you keep telling me that there's "nothing wrong with spending money expecting no benefit in return" - of course not! But in many cases it's a terrible financial choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:48:16
Well, if you can afford to always buy steaks instead of ground beef then that's fine. All I've been saying here is that I hope people buying these expensive cars are not doing so without having "everything" else in order first. It'd be a very poor financial choice. Huge difference between buying a steak when one really shouldn't and buying an $80K car when one really shouldn't. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:05:27
I bought on Coinbase with a credit card... the type that gives you 4% kickback. ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:40
No. A car is usually never an investment. It's a loss. My point was to make that loss as small as possible - aka, a cheaper car. Depreciation on a cheaper car is still a loss, and therefore not an investment. How do you think buying a cheaper car would be an investment? It's not. It's a smaller loss than with a more expensive one, but you still won't earn a penny on it - *still a loss*.
And for heavens sake - I've never said anything about OP in particular. I have no idea what his finances are like. And remember - there's no need to write in all caps. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:07:33
It does make sense to take into account loss of value - especially with large purchases. Unless one has plenty of money those choices are made every single day; will I eat out every day this week? No, because even though I can technically afford it I will then have less money as a buffer/or to save. If you are more reckless with your money because you can afford it then that's fine. But most people make choices like that every single day. 
I've never said that there is something *wrong* with buying an expensive car, but that's only when one can **actually** afford it. Unless you are absolutely loaded it's still going to be a pretty poor choice because that money could have been spent so much differently. It's still fine to do it, but it doesn't make it a smart move. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:55:24
Of course. I've never said anything else. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:41:17
If BTC ever goes to 1 million it'd be a pretty wise decision to sell some. Hell, even if it goes to 100K it'd be a wise choice. Getting out one's initial investment is a good thing. If everything then goes straight to hell you'll then still be in the same position as to begin with... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:18:03
And that's fine.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:41:50
Huge difference between zero enjoyment and a car this expensive. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:57:32
People here need to stop thinking I have said that OP has debt. I have never said so - I don't know what he has. And no, student loans are not a poor financial choice for many of us. It's a necessity one has to take up to get a decent job today. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:55:57
I've never said anything about this being very wrong if one is debt free. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:03:28
It's not just this. Most people end up having kids. Who do you think is most likely to end up being the one who is taking more care of the kids? Who might have to work a bit less every week for the benefit of the kids? Who do you think is expected to take out most of the (mandatory) parental leave? Often times when women have children they end up realizing there are more important things in life than money. And also get extremely stressed out balancing kids and a job. They might still work full time, but might decide to find a job with less overtime (and then less $$$). 
In my country the majority of students in law school are female. Still most partners in law firms are male. Partners earn a lot more than just regular attorneys. Most male attorneys also, of course, end up having children, but many of them might still value their career more than their kids.
So therefore I believe some of the so called "wage gap" is not just because of the type of work women choose, but it's also because when family life comes along women are a lot more likely to be willing to / more or less forced to "take one for the team" and change careers.

That's a nasty interest. Here it is about 2%. But the entire loan is deleted if you end up on disability. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:22:11
I bought a tiny bit last month, just for fun really. Whenever a dip comes I'm definitely buying more, but not exactly going to risk all of my savings... just going to buy an amount I won't really "care" if I lose. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:03:29
Don't you have to take up a loan in Germany to at least pay for the cost of living? I know education is free in Germany (I'm from Norway - it is free here as well), but I still had to take up a loan to help pay for my rent, food etc. I also studied a year in the US so I have about $40 000 in debt. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:02:10
Oh, I see! Here most students don't rely on support from their parents and instead take up the loan and then have a part time job (some do of course get some money from their parents as well...) 40% of the loan is turned into a scholarship if you pass your exams. I'd say about $22 000 is about the least debt most students here have after  doing a bachelor... but a lot of people, like me, do a master and then also study some abroad --&gt; plenty of debt.

...then how is it a savings account? I get 2,20% in Norway. Still not an amazing deal but it's fine. Edit: yeah yeah, inflation inflation - but I hope you're seriously not getting 0%.
