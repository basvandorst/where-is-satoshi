Yeah, but there's bound to be a revolution at some point.  As much as they want to keep the masses in our current age, stupid, deluded and misinformed, the information age will prevail.
The governments and corporations simply have no interest in any of those things.  Renewable?  Hah!  Print your own things?  Unthinkable!
The current monetary system will soon be obsolete and replaced by a new form of payment.  For example, you see it everywhere, in every sci-fi flick or game "credits" or whatever you want to call em.  They're not physical, they're just stored on a card.  Like your debit card.  Except they're more like BTC.
Star Trek had all kinds of technologies that are available today, even in ToS.  If you watched it, too.  
But yeah, i'll have to re-download that movie.
I may also freeze myself if it's something that can be done.  Just hope I don't wake up in the middle of an alien-human war or something.  Or not at all.

It's all relative, as you said.  I mean, it won't be as impressive as all these things being invented in his lifetime, but we've come to a point where we can only improve on current technology.  There's simply so much less that can be invented.  That and let's face it.  The 90's kids were the last decent generation we had.  Today's kids, don't even get me started.  I'm from the 80's, where soccer moms didn't exist and we didn't act a fool.
Then again, who knows what'll pop up next.  Holographic screens, touchless controls, virtual reality... 
Also early 2000's was trash tv's beginnings.  I lived through the MusicTV becoming MoronTV.
