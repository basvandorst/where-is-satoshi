Finding the source should be easy.  Get the ID from the installed Extensions page (like gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidoz), then look for it in a location like:
~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidoz
If you do this, you can even fork the code to prevent malicious updates: just copy the directory then enable Chrome's Developer mode to load unpacked extensions.

Assuming I trust the seller to destroy the digital copy of the private key, is this still secure?

In the UK, what is the best way to buy physical bitcoins without getting price-gouged (i.e. not eBay)?
I like the look of [Bit card]( but I'm not confident on dealing with a digital wallet payment with BitPay.

Sounds like a good prospect.  Good luck.  Keep us updated how you're doing.

I realise you've already bought the computer hardware, but how does minimum wage compare to having to eventually replace hardware, electricity, etc?  Is there genuinely positive ROI on mining?
