Yes you do. Many have made more then 900% + in a year, just by buying and not selling. By many I mean every single person that bought and didn't sell. 
Also this thing happens very often where the btc price goes up 40% then down 20% and all the media shout out that bitcoin has crashed 20% (neglecting to mention the 40% rise in the headline). I see this as fake news headlines and try to buy whenever the price is low. 
Another thing is it has been difficult for those who want to buy BTC to actually buy it recently. For one reason or another, each broker has temporarily blocked new users from signing up. Therefore once the brokers and exchanges are set up to cope with the unprecedented demand to buy bitcoin, its price will rise very quickly.
There has also been another thing happening where people challenge posts like this one, trying to make it look like I am wrong and they are right - but they are probably paid shills working for the banks (who are worried because they are not needed anymore and will all have to close at some point because blockchain technology can't be corrupted like a banker can). At some point in the near future, people who get in the way of blockchain tech being introduced will be basically admitting they are criminals who want to work the system. Once those elements are out of the way, there will be no stopping it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:43:52
I made 900% in a year and you are trying to press the messsage that investing in bitcoin is somehow not good? which bank do you work for. FUD nonsense. Lies. 
Investing in bitcoin is a no-brainer. I'm not even gonna continue explaining how wrong this is.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:52:23
Ladies and Gentlemen, this is what it has come to. Paid shills posting FUD in an absolutely desperate attempt to make people think bitcoin will not continue its rise. All these fud posts are laughable. They really are. What utter nonsense to suggest bitcoin is a bubble that could burst. Like the central banking system didn't fail. Yeh right. Rubbish rubbish rubbish shitposts. my btc is up 900%. Don't listen to the bullshit. They're all buying in low because they probably get paid rubbish wages typing lies all day, being all contrary af. Laughable.

I don't understand. Can somebody rewrite in English please.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:07:40
Thank you. Good to see sensible posts that are not created by paid shills desperately trying to paint a picture of bitcoin failing (because they are worried because lightning and segwit are coming and that means the end of a lot of stupid stupid stuff that people have to put up with because banks). 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:21:53
We are all laughing at you

He's wrong. Can you not take in basic information?
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:10:35
Evidently you are ignoring the obvious here. I think it is understandable to leave out 2014. Just check that Moon Math chart thing that regularly gets updated; all predictions are looking good for bitcoin at 1 million by 2020 -2022. 2014 was a bad year. Stop nit picking at this guy's post. It's obvious you are shilling.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:24:22
Any chance they can remove the other stuff and just list the Bitcoin info?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:26:32
haha 'this is my last response'. Spoken like someone who genuinely thinks they are correct. 
You accuse me of predicting the market cap - I did not do that.
You suggest there is a website called 'moonmath'. I said there was a chart. That is two lies. In your first two paragraphs.
In a court, we wouldn't continue with you from here.
Why are you spending all day on a website about bitcoin trying to convince people that their 900% + investment is going to turn around and fail? WHy? How much are they paying you? Do your employers really think people are that stupid? You are transparent in your motives. I am a member of MENSA and I would like you to know that I am very probably far more intelligent than you. So you can take your Oxford (which is probably built on my lands because I am a descendant of Royalty) and you can shove it, Mr Normal.

The other sub is full of lies about this sub being pro centralization, but evidently the commenters here seem genuinely and justifiably peeved about what happened today. Roger Ver is a crook. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:20:26
Just a word of warning, because I've seen too many friends get burned. Anyone thinking about selling belongings, taking out a loan to buy bitcoin, leaving their job, down-sizing etc should take heed of what I'm about to say. Obviously it's a really big decision and anyone considering it needs to take into account the ins and outs of it all. After considering all the factors, they then need to ignore the naysayers and just do it - like immediately. With any luck they didn't waste too much time weighing it up. There is nothing more reckless than not buying bitcoin. Refraining from buying bitcoin takes balls of steel and I would not recommend it to anyone - it's too risky. I admire their guts for not buying in, but people like that, who always go against the grain tend to lose out. So don't be stupid - sell everything you own right now, get the biggest loan you can and stop spending money on stupid things. Spend it all on bitcoin.

They're too late with all this ETF stuff. There isn't enough bitcoin remaining to be mined. WHat is it now, 85% of btc is in circulation ? 
Also the price has already started to rise again. I bet the sept 30th ETF decision, if a denial (which I hope it is) will have even less of an effect on btc price than this.
The community seem wise to this bs now. Banksters are not needed.
@_date: 2018-08-13 09:53:05
This is why I've been saying I really hope the ETF doesn't happen. The sock puppets have been out in force bigging up the ETF and the same sock puppets will be Fudding when it gets pulled. 
ETF isn't needed. Bitcoin got to where it is now without ETF.
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:29:59
Your opinions are rubbish and are not being requested, so you should shut it.
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:49:20
Please please let the ETF not happen. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 11:13:06
I don't believe you really are struggling to understand this. It is simple. People don't trust banksters - they have a track record. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:25:19
It's rising now (again)
@_date: 2018-08-08 11:45:43

Great news!
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:18:57
..and hopefully no ETF's get approved and people new to BTC realize banksters buying and selling in unison is neither needed or good.
@_date: 2018-08-23 09:28:02
Yes. People should be careful not to not buy any bitcoin, because its price has gone from 15 cents to over 6k.

@_date: 2018-08-09 16:49:58
I don't need to read that but you are projecting your lack of knowledge onto me and it is you who is not informed about bitcoin because you appear to be someone who would argue that it is raining on a sunny day due to your original post arguing that ETF is adoption etc - as if bitcoin magically went from 0 to 6k plus because of ETF when that is rubbish (as I already pointed out to you). Look mate, I have better things to do than point out the obvious to you. Face it - you are wrong and bitcoin is amazing and does not need an ETF. The fact that you do not grasp this illustrates your lack of understanding of the fact that normal people buying bits here and there is better than banksters who can not be trusted snaffling up a shed load of btc only to sell at opportune times in conjunction with FUD lies from their cohorts. 
Go and read the bitcoin.org introduction and learn how bitcoin works.

@_date: 2018-05-24 10:17:32
I think the answer is is a resounding 'Yes!'. Sock puppets. It also occurred to me that these people must be cheapskates if they really need it to go down to 1-3k. It goes against the narrative that the bankers have the means to control it.
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:09:13
It was only at 19k for a tiny amount of time. People never mention this. You'd have to have been lucky to catch that spike.
@_date: 2017-03-25 09:00:39
Also the same people who are saying it would be a disaster if BTC hit like $300 are the same people bigging up other crypto currencies that have never been as high as $300.

No it most deffo isn't. Even if it was over now, it still wouldn't be a bubble. Zero is a lot less than 3 grand is it not. Anyway that's all by the by - because it isn't over (despite the efforts of sock puppets representing the banksters).
@_date: 2018-12-17 20:23:19
