Looks like it'll be buried by the community like the other 3.

FIAT is currently the breadwinner until this community get their act together.

They will bow down to any pressure from the community. Nothing will happen.

He left the keys on the counter top one day whilst ordering his frappucino and a Starbucks employee unknowingly threw away billions of dollars away in the trash... Either that or he had them printed on edible rice paper sheets and got hungry one day.
Everyone quick! Find out what landfill in Japan Starbucks sends their garbage to and lets all go on a treasure hunt.
Everything is speculation at this point... Until we hear any official word, finding out what happened to your coins is like finding a needle in a haystack.

Wow. I spend a few minutes during breaks/free time getting my daily Bitcoin news and I vaguely remember this sub having only a few thousand subscribers when I first started lurking. Oh Bitcoin how you have grown!!
A lot of people are aware Bitcoin exists but very few still own any. 
To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛..○

Well, if he went to such lengths to protect his anonymity then why would he have used his real name? Doesn't make sense... The man is a smartarse playing dumb. He probably fully expected to be identified eventually. This doesn't change the fact that he has nothing to do with the development of Bitcoin anymore but raises questions about what will happen to the first Bitcoins ever mined since they remain untouched.

It's gambling for those who plow ridiculous amounts of money into it. As always, invest as much as you can afford to lose. I have friends that have plowed life savings into crypto after seeing what I've made on the technology despite me advising against it. 
As always, some people just don't listen either.

I decided to sell enough just so I could break-even and make my investment zero risk. Not getting too invested emotionally with regards to how much money my investment is worth now. I already have mental health issues so I prefer keeping stress levels to a minimum to avoid a manic episode. 
If I sold now the money would go to my head so I prefer to take the risk of losing it all as I in reality I have not lost anything should Bitcoin go tits up.

I have millions of satoshis.
Invested back when Bitcoin was at $15.  Already seen my investment appreciate 700%.
Not even close to a millionaire, although I remain optimistic that I will one day be able to pay off at least all my student debt .  If only I didn't spend all my Bitcoin on controlled substances then I would certainly be half way there.
From profits made due to the rush in price I made my initial investment back so decided to sell and cover it . I have already broke even and this is a zero risk investment and hopefully the best I will ever make.
I do actually use the currency as frequently as possible, I would like to see it adopted by the masses which can only make it more valuable. 
Oh and remember to only invest what you can afford to loose.

Most of us do not have the luxury of your coin hoarding from last year, we are merely trying to be persuaded to adopt this genius invention into our daily lives.

My turd is a commodity too. 
I plan on setting up an exchange, there is only a finite amount being produced every day (1-2 turds on average, 3 on a good day). 
With the difficulty increasing as I decide to hold it in. This is very rare so I plan on speculating an ounce of my turd to cost $100,000. More valuable than gold.
Wait for a bubble to form by hoarding my turd, then dumping it on the markets causing a crash and panic sell.
So much shit I am reading in this subreddit, it has become comical.

Bitcoin store seems to be US only, also with regards to those prices I have seen all of them on par fiat and I have also found all their products they stock cheaper on reputable websites that accept fiat. Also you have to take into account that most users hoping to adopt bitcoin do not have the luxury of your coin hoarding from last year and will have to settle at buying at market price.
Coin base is only US only, and most all the exchanges I have encountered capable of accepting my local currency charge fees.
Bank wires do seem like a pro to bitcoin, however my bank charges does not charge ridiculous fees for international transfers and it is more convenient to just transfer my money without jumping through the hoops of trusting an exchange or individual with my money and obtaining the coins. Please accept that we have become lazy as individuals in the 21st century and expect to go about reaching A to B with as little effort as possible. Most of us are productive individuals and do not want to go about spending our time seeking coins.

Doing drugs is the best thing that ever happened to me... Without Silk Road I may have never seen the true potential of Bitcoin. The concept is genius
Literally paid off my student loans and I still have Bitcoins locked away in a paper wallet.

This company is like the Harold Camping of Bitcoin, "The worlds going to end &gt; No let me revise that".
Companies like this do themselves no favors. 
Im pissed.

The technology is genius, no doubt about that.
But to be completely honest my agenda at this present time and I know I am not the only one, is to make money. 
I do however wish to see Bitcoin flourish, as It does have it's uses but I do not see it replacing fiat. My opinion is that fiat is and will remain the more convenient way of trading for the foreseeable future. 
I still use the currency though, but only for illicit activities that I would rather not have traced back to me ;)
I have learnt so much about cryptography and perhaps a little economics too.

Any chance of a Blockchain.info field?
Very good job though, thanks!

Full of speculative bullshit right now and i'm having fun time reading them.
Funny how you fucktards claim it's the "weekly correction". In reality all you idiots haven't got a clue why. Someone is playing the market. 
That's what happens when you put all your faith on one exchange that employs 6 employees. I think you have all forgotten that this exchange was hacked in 2011. 15,000 people waiting to get verified and you wonder why people bother with this incompetent company.
Decentralised? My arse, the exchanges set the price, have left themselves vulnerable to these attacks.
Bitcoin "economists" please keep posting your rubbish. I find it amusing.
This is of course temporary, but just shows you. Merchants are not going to adopt in this current state, this is NOT a get rich quick scheme. 
Bring on the downvotes.
