EXACTLY. It is still VERY early. We are about to see just the BEGINNING of mainstream investment $$$ coming into Bitcoin via SME futures contracts, and soon ETF’s, etc. The floodgates will open up and nobody should be surprised to see Bitcoin trading at $25K, then $50K, and beyond. Eventually, if just 1-2% of the world’s investment dollars are in Crypto Currencies, we will see a market cap of 10-20X the current levels. Furthermore, at that time, most people will be trading Bits and Satoshi’s, not full Bitcoins, because by then those denominations will be worth enough for everyday purchases. VERY EARLY indeed! ����

Not sure where you are getting your numbers from... go to coinmarketcap.com and you will see the worldwide volume in just the LAST 24 HOURS is well over $2.5 BILLION... ��

Seriously, do the math. Even a child can multiply by 13.5... Bitcoin is virtually half the CC market... when just 1% of the world's investment income ends up in it (that is $2 trillion... yes, you read right... TRILLION), Bitcoin will be selling at $65K... that is predicted to be in just 3-5 years. Obviously you are championing an alt coin and want to bash the first to market... when in fact you had to UTILIZE BTC to even BUY that alt coin in the first place, ROFL. I loved watching the roller coaster over the long weekend. Meanwhile, my BTC stayed locked in it's wallet. Life is too short to worry about bear traps and bashers. Cheers M8! ������

To clarify, I didn't say Bitcoin would gain that 1%... I said cryptocurrencies (as a class of investments) would do so. That is NOT unreasonable, given how much mainstream press and momentum CC's are gaining. Given they have gone from 2% to 9% of the $2 trillion required to get there in just the past 6 months, it is totally reasonable to believe that in 5 years the exponential growth required to hit the mark is more than possible. Some pretty skilled people in the field have predicted a $500K Bitcoin in the next 10-13 years... My belief in a small fraction of that @ $50-65K appears reasonable by comparison. The hardware and mechanics for Bitcoin are already very much established (the infrastructure is there), it has proven resilient when facing improvements (i.e. SegWit) and hard forks, and, in my eyes, the Bell Curve for product awareness is still in it's infancy. As more and more "regular" people become aware of this viable asset class (and start to invest in it), the price will naturally continue to rise over time. As such, to believe that a $5K Bitcoin will eventually seem like a great entry price is also more than reasonable. Time will tell.

That is a GOOD start indeed... ��

Exactly. I have bought there in small amounts the past few months. It is great for small purchases via CC. Once it accumulates to a decent amount I have always send it to my wallet. ����

NO. See my edited post above. ��

Precisely. We rest our case! ����

Whatever you do, get your BTC out of Coinbase. They are part of the Segwit2X conspiracy. There is a possibility of losing BTC due to the nature of the hard fork (no replay protection). Get your BTC out to a safe place such as a hardware wallet (Ledger, Trevor) or at least a reputable software wallet on iOS (Bread). Simply explained, after the BTG / B2X events you may have THREE coins, including your current Core BTC. As you never hold your own keys in Coinbase, your BTC is currently technically THEIRS, not yours. You need to hold your own (wallet) keys to keep everything safe. Then just follow instructions that will inevitably be provided by your wallet creator once (if) the hard forks happen. Good luck! ����
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:05:44
Good stuff. You will be safe with Bread. When/if the time comes to sell your BTC alt coins (BTG = Bitcoin Gold and/or B2X = SegWit2X), Bread (Reddit: r/BreadWallet) will let you know how to do it safely. That is done within the Advanced section (click “Menu” / “Settings” / “Advanced”). I hope I was some help to you. Have fun! ����

No kidding. The plastic wrapped stacks and bricks of USD that are confiscated from drug rings everyday prove that it is still the currency of choice for those unsavory characters. Bitcoin is no more utilized for crime and criminals than any other Fiat currency. It’s just another excuse to bash something these boneheads are afraid of cutting into their profits!

You can leave it in Coinbase. LiteCoin will NOT be affected technically by anything going on in Bitcoin. The worst thing that can happen is that it might get pulled down price wise if the Bitcoin hard fork gets messy. But as Bitcoin always does it will rise again. ��

LiteCoin has good tech. Transactions are very fast and very inexpensive. They use the Lightning network. It is one of the original “Big Three”, Ethereum being the second, with Bitcoin being the first to market. LiteCoin is often referred to the “Silver to Bitcoin’s Gold”. ��
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:09:02
Exactly. Hence the REASON Bitcoin was invented! ����

No. Your wallet is like a secure bank account as long as you hold your own keys (recovery words). Your Bitcoin balance is worth whatever the market price of Bitcoin is. Also if you have had your BTC in your wallet since before Bitcoin Cash (August 1st), your wallet actually contains that as well. To split it is different for the various wallet types. Hardware wallets like Ledger will actually show your BCH balance at this point (if you had 1 Bitcoin before the split, you will now also see 1 Bitcoin Cash coin in the separate account for BCH). For paper wallets, I believe you simply need to import your BTC paper wallet (using your recovery keys/words) into a BCH wallet and “presto” you will now have the same amount of BCH in that wallet that you have in your Bitcoin wallet. Hope that helps! ����

Blockchain is part of Segwit2X. GET YOUR BTC OUT OF THERE! If B2X has a “longer blockchain” they will change the name of the NEW ALT COIN to Bitcoin and what has always been Bitcoin will be renamed, as per their post! That means your current Bitcoin may be lost/stolen, not to mention renamed. Given B2X also has NO Replay Protection, the same addresses would work on BOTH blockchains which could also result in a loss of coins. Being on iOS is tons better than a Windows PC. As long as you have your recovery words and have them safely written down (not saved on any digital media on a device that has ever been online) you should be OK. For the record, I just ordered my Ledger Nano S hardware wallet today directly from the factory in France. If you do invest in one, be sure to avoid hardware wallets from 3rd party sources (from someone that owned it first or an Amazon seller, even if they say it is new. They COULD have copied the keys to use nefariously at a later date once you have cryptocurrency stored in it). ��

When “SELECT” businesses and miners get together behind the backs of the long time developers of Bitcoin, with the intent of hijacking the name and taking control of something that was meant to be uncontrollable, I would call that a CONSPIRACY.  ����

Liability... you would certainly think Bitmain would be responsible for a whole lot of it. Might even provoke a class action suit if people start having their info/accounts/data compromised... ��
@_date: 2017-10-24 03:42:15
Well, this is a HUGE win for Core. What made Coinbase waffle? Are they not a signatory to the NYA? 
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:39:26
Yaaaaaaaaaa, you have a point there. The government probably just asked Bitmain to “Hand it over”, so THEY could sell the info themselves (“for the good of the great Chinese nation”) ����
@_date: 2017-10-18 23:03:55
Yaaaaaa..... so predictable that some big players would “shake the tree” to loosen Bitcoin from the “weak bulls”. On Bittrex it went down to $5,089... now back up to $5,600, ROFL! ��������
