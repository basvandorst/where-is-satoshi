Ehh you could try localbitcoins - you could look for Bitcoin listings for it.

His reddit username is TinnedSpaghettiHoops. I highly doubt there's any correlation between that name and his other online names. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:27:37
He can. Most sites require ID so as long as you're 18 or older he'll be fine.
Local bitcoins takes a range of payments, well over 10 I believe. I personally use national bank transfers.

He's probably going to suggest that he'll accept Steam games or items for a markup.

If he's 17 he won't be able to get onto any exchanges unless he registers and identifies under one of your parents' names.
If not, localbitcoins will do. Topgetcrypto will sort him out if he explains the situation.

United States Air Force you say? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:28:29
Ah that's super unfortunate. How long was it on there for?
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:47:52
Localbitcoins. There's sellers on there who accept No-ID for youngsters. Topgetcrypto for example.
LB doesn't have age verification or limits though so you can confirm identity even of you're only 13.

Yeah understandable. Exaggeration came off a little wrong haha. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 10:26:31
He had it sitting there for a few weeks. He explaied above. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:53:18
Most likely not.
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:52:06
Why on earth did you have that saved on an exchange?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:53:45
Ah yeah.. bad move haha
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:27:31
$20k. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:28:08
Did I tell him that he should never have any money on an exchange or did I ask him why he had 20k on an exchange just sitting there?
