Guess it depends where you start looking at it. Kinda unfair to choose right when BCH started if you consider wen BTC started.

I think you need to do more research on how cryptocurrency actually works before trying to spread FUD. 
Bitcoin doesn't care where it's recipient is you can send coins to any wallet no matter where the person accessing it is. Granted it would be hard to send USD to Venezuela, that's why we have crypto now. 
222 day old account's first post is half incoherent rambling on how government will shut down crypto.

It’s too late to be stopped. Crypto cannot be stopped.

I'm having a hard time understanding your English. Just trying to clear up your doubt. There is other ways to purchase cryptocurrency than coinbase. There's even somewhat anonymous ways to if you don't want your government knowing. 
If anything your bank will give you a hard time for buying crypto but they can shut down coinbase.

That would only be the case if people here listen to Reddit masses when deciding what to invest in instead of doing their own research. So be it. Their loss. I'm not in the business of passing that responsibility onto fellow redditors. Might as well have the government tell you what crypto to use if you're gonna listen to Reddit. 
Edit: deleted last sentence mis read what you said about bcash. If bcash closes in on bitcoin market cap then good for them it would mean that they would have done some really hard work to win over the opinions of a lot of people.

The exchanges will open back up in other countries where its legal.

Who cares honestly. Jesus. If people find value in bcash then it will show with the market. Simple as that. Just focus on what crypto you like. The market will show which ones deserve value.

I never said decentralized networks but I know a few in the works one being the kyber network. 
But localbitcoins.com accepts a multitude of payments.

Smartphones the new currency apparently. I'll be handing over my phone for lunch in 5 years calling it now.

Possible yes. But after learning literally everything it's unlikely.

I think a super intelligent AI would be capable of finding professional hitmen. I mean if it's the kind of AI that can learn everything in a matter of days I really doubt it would need hit men, but if it did I truly doubt it would hire some dumbass with fedora.
