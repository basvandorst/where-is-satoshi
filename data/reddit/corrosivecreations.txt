I like that a lot. Good work
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:46:29
Thanks. I appreciate it
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:48:43
Its a custom job so the owner MIGHT not want me to do others. If you have any custom requests, feel free to message me directly 
@_date: 2018-08-07 05:26:14
The whole thing is clear coated so its gonna stay like that forever.
I keep the back free from clear coat so you can touch the corrosion, thats where the serial number and signature is 
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:12:04
It was just a guy that likes dbz and bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:35:01

@_date: 2018-05-24 14:39:54
Cheers 
@_date: 2018-08-14 18:22:57
Message me then. I do custom work ��
@_date: 2018-08-14 19:38:46
Check this profile, iv done copper before. If you look up corrosive creations on Instagram you will see a wide range of my stuff
@_date: 2018-08-06 21:10:04
Pretty much the opposite of what you see here, it would be nice
@_date: 2018-08-07 04:45:53
Only directly through me,  if you send a message on here you can have it. The price is 0.022btc
@_date: 2018-08-06 19:33:08
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-08-07 14:26:24
Im an optimist, but that's just not rational ��
Gold doesn't corrode
@_date: 2018-08-25 20:37:23
Please keep that private key safe!  Wow, great little idea
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:45:01
I think anyone who is part of this reddit has probably at some point been on the forum at some point, its kinda unavoidable �� glad you like it though
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:27:31
You can if you want ��
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:29:41
Its called making the most of a bear market 
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:00:24
These are 100 bucks in BTC fully shipped 
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:49:57
I would if i could 
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:50:27
That's scottish grass! 
@_date: 2019-02-26 03:51:59
No, its been clearcoated to prevent that happening 
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:00:40
I think its an interesting process 
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:27:54
Thanks 
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:27:12
Yes, it is clearcoated to prevent it changing any in the future 
@_date: 2019-02-26 02:26:37
Its basically salt, ammonia and a special secret sauce i use
@_date: 2019-02-26 20:27:03
These are 260mmx260mm. Your best bet to get in touch regarding one of these is via a message here or through bitcointalk.org (username is corrosive) 
@_date: 2019-04-02 13:02:38
Thats pretty cool! Now i know how it'll look.
Cheers! 
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:50:34
@_date: 2019-04-02 03:09:51
Yes but id prefer to keep that to PM. I don't want this to be portrayed as a sales post 
@_date: 2018-11-03 11:41:16
Private message me on bitcointalk is the best way
@_date: 2018-11-02 19:40:05
Thats what i do �� you can find these in the collectibles section of bitcointalk. Thats where i put these up 
@_date: 2018-11-07 20:12:31
Yes, i will be letting these go in the bitcointalk collectible forum tomorrow
@_date: 2018-11-02 13:29:53
No snakes were harmed in the making of this...... However as a 30 something year old guy, im upset about this costing me one of my many pair of fishnets.... 
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:40:39
Thats what i do. This one is sold already 
@_date: 2019-01-20 20:54:56
Yup, thats pretty much how its done ��
@_date: 2018-11-03 11:40:48
Look up corrosive creations on Instagram. Iv done loooads
@_date: 2019-01-21 12:43:40
Itl make the Mt Gox events look tiny
@_date: 2018-11-03 07:32:40
Glad you noticed 
@_date: 2019-09-03 20:27:44
You have my upvote. Very cool
@_date: 2019-09-01 16:11:03
Other pic 
@_date: 2019-09-01 16:45:45
If you DM me yes, you can indeed!
@_date: 2019-09-15 14:27:01
The beauty of btc is that its permissionless �� nobody can stop anyone sending BTC. Do a little research, grab some wallet software , store your seed phrase or private key securely and go ahead. Nobody can stop you
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:01:22
Im doing this run first. Custom cards further down the line ��
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:56:24
It is indeed
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:21:11
Where to purchase?
@_date: 2018-12-16 08:28:13
Thats a nice idea, il definitely do something else further down the road so appreciate the brain food. There's only 3 left of the original 10 i put up yesterday and can be found here..
@_date: 2019-05-11 02:55:05
More images on links underneath 
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:56:48
 For everything there is a collectibles community, im part of it and i cater to like minded people. A better question is, why not??
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:41:54
Havnt weighed it yet, this is just a proto and proof of concept
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:05:50
Have a look on the collectibles section on bitcointalk.org. I put up an announcement on there ����
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:36:25
Boom, done
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:54:18
In time, yes. Gotta get this done first tho
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:06:20
No, i came here to show off my wares but when people ask questions i can hardly go dark on them
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:25:29
Once i have completed the first suit (spades), these will be individually up for auction on bitcointalk in the collectibles section.
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:07:30
They will be not only inside a plastic sealed sleeve but also in sn airtight hard plastic top loader. They wont stay perfect forever however all i can do is prevent it for as long as possible
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:00:19
I cant. Iv gotta keep all the sales in the one place and in the same format, (auction) on bitcointalk
