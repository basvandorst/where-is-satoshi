Monero shill
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:50:06
Lol what a false dichotomy. as soon as capitalism is criticized capitalist shills start jumping around going "but commewnizm haz nevr werkd!! CHECKMATE COMMIES" as if the only alternative is complete state control and dominance. Love it.

Not really. Maybe just not Bitcoin but I could imagine a new coin that is useful in this aspect.
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:00:16
How could bitcoin distribute wealth when the rich still exist? They have their hands in everything
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:52:23
Competition does suck in that it leads to needless waste of resources. Oh sorry I mean fuck you
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:29:25
I have the same issue and it's really annoying because I'm getting unnecessary fees on coinbase.

How the fuck would they buy btc just to pump it when the point is you don't need to own the asset to short it?

@_date: 2017-11-27 02:17:45
I predicted the memes generated from 9k would propel btc to 10k faster than 8k to 10k. Now I say the buzz in the media 10k will create will push it even further at an even faster pace possibly hitting even 12k, then will eventually lose hype and level off somewhere in between 10k for a while before the next bull run to 15k.

Where is it stated in it's definition that there must be a centralization of power?
Maybe marxist is too loaded of a term. To those who believe in a more equitable society Bitcoin is great way to democratize money and banking. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 05:43:38
I don't support bcash any more than btc other than in dollars. But my point is that you don't need to be so hostile towards it. I am allies with all crypto as long as they're legitimate.

There is so much paranoia around wallets. You will be fine if you keep it there. Just don't share your info with people you don't trust. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:23:22
This is what I don't understand. Why haven't Gemini and bitstamp made decent apps to compete with coinbase yet? I think they're so dominant because they're the only players in the app market, which for noobs is very convenient
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:38:37
I already do that but honestly the mobile website isn't that good
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:40:57
You nailed it. Westerners are typically ignorant on *why* so many nations on the planet are inescapably broke while industrial nations are rich in comparison. The reason is that these countries have been robbed over the years. For example, look at the history of central America.

The memes produced by 9k will propel bitcoin to 10k almost immediately

That's just too practical and not fun enough

To play devil's advocate, Why would anyone use Bitcoin when other coins are more practical to use and have less fees?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:42:43
Do you genuinely seek an answer or is this a joke?
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:13:28

Idiot bets it all on AAPL short, loses big time but apparently it was a demo account so it was fictional.
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:39:08
Agreed. Why are people so damn divisive?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:54:38
That's the point
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:36:51
I would consider myself a libertarian socialist, in that I believe in a more Democratic organization of private property and support the working class over elites, and also have strong anti-athoritarian/hierarchical streak. I think Bitcoin does a beautiful thing in that it puts the power of the financial system in the hands of individuals, especially those who exist in 3rd world nations. Although I have issues with the concept of money in a society, mainly because of its corrupting and exploitative influence, I still think crypto currency is a much, much Better alternative to fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:21:05
No it is not.
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:39:14
If you're so prepared why don't you try to short it?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:35:54
Hahaha 
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:52:03
Now that u mentioned Robinhood I kinda want to liquidate that and put it towards Bitcoin instead. ��
@_date: 2017-11-26 10:41:19
I find this sentiment a lot around here. Are you an ancap?
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:46:22
Who's bigger than coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:25:58
Who knows dude. You will either be rich or go broke. I took the risk.

Oh didn't know this. Does Gemini have one in the pipes?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:24:24
Don't buy when it's up so fast like now. Buy when people get scared and it falls a bit. I know how easy it is to get FOMO but you gotta fight it
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:51:35
So basically the argument is Bitcoin has the advantage of being first. And youre right when people think crypto they think btc. I guess growth is still very much possible from here until crypto becomes mainstream enough for people to use, but after that point if Bitcoin is still as cumbersome to use as it is now then an alt coin will probably take it's place as an easy to use currency.
@_date: 2017-11-18 00:23:16
People will downvote literally anything,  even if they agree

Yeah homie there's a lot of us :). Bitcoin tends to attract libertarians/anarchists of both the "left" and "right".
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:21:13
No need to be condescending. My bank is very small so it's hard to figure this shit out when Gemini just says to contact my bank. Coinbase won't allow me to finish inputting my info like where I previously worked, my social security, etc. I can still buy and sell crypto on it I just can't move over to gdax.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:36:18
It very nearly did 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:27:51
Nice. Glad you made a decent return. On to 10k!
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:20:20
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:54:50
No they are not. They're a competing crypto in a capitalist paradigm. They're just a currency trying to be dominant over the other. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:04:29
Yes it is
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:19:39
But theyre in control of the people, a very Democratic idea that appeals to marxists. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:59:17

Wow you typed way too much for an inconsiquential comment. It seems like manipulation in that it doesn't seem like organic buying by retail investors. The Soros comment was sort of a joke. But you're right in that no one knows for sure who is buying.
