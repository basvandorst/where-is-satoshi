This is very clearly a single player executing a pretty well known trading strategy.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:50:58
Resorting back to that, eh? I think it's just you who should admit that you're wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:06:20
More ad hominem. Keep flailing, mate. I enjoy it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:14:42
Notice how you have to keep resorting to hyperbole and ad hominem? It's very telling. You lack substance and confidence. I'm just talking about the way things are. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:41:57
Nobody know?
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:23:50
No they aren't. This is how all markets operate. I watched something very similar go down on the CME on yesterday. There are no rules against using your own massive volume to make the market respond in favorable ways.
Maybe you're thinking of spoofing? Which is now illegal, but which continues to occur in reality. And there's definitely spoofing going on crypto markets. It's pretty blatant. But that's not what this is at all.

No, they won't. This is absolutely normal trading behavior. In fact, I'm happy to see it because it means real traders are trading BTC. It's not just behavioral economics at play due to a bunch of scrubs trading based on their gut.
You'll see the exact same thing happening in almost all markets, including futures, treasury, options, etc.

Very possibly an algo in action, no doubt. But it's very cool to watch. I'm envious. Someone has some serious money to throw around, and they are absolutely raking it in right now.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:29:31
Thanks for the tip.
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:32:06
I rely on order flow analysis and limited TA for my trades, not luck.

Your false confidence is ringing so fucking hollow, mate.
Is the CME a small exchange? The foreign exchange? S&amp;P? These are some of the BIGGEST exchanges and markets in the world, mate. Far, far bigger than fucking GDAX. Obviously your perspective is skewed. You're like the hick from the small town that thinks it's big as hell... until you show up in New York and stare at a city, dumbstruck.
GDAX isn't a big market. The volume isn't impressive. You want volume? Let's talk about the trillions of dollars that get traded DAILY on the foreign exchange. Let's talk about the fucking TREASURY. Real institutions, real markets, real volume. They absolutely dwarf GDAX.
And guess what? Single traders manipulate them all the time. It doesn't matter that you're only 1 person when you've got millions or billions at your disposal. When you can buy up 1000 contracts at a time, you can absolutely move even the biggest of markets.
Stop spouting off shit you don't know about. What I said is common sense and well known amongst people that actually trade. You've outed yourself as a dumbass.
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:36:54
As I said, you lack substance. You're hanging yourself out to dry on the dumb assumption that single traders can't move markets. You lack any evidence of this, other than that it doesn't sound right to you, and so you resort to ad hominem, hyperbole, and dismissive comments. 
But your ignorance is on full display from the get-go. Single traders absolutely move markets, all the time. Not just shitty little GDAX markets, either. It happens regularly with treasury notes, e-mini futures, forex, etc. When you get a hedge fund  trader up to bat with millions at their disposal, it's common to see them throwing the market around. It gets interesting when another big player comes on the scene and they duke it out. This is the reality of how markets work. For retail traders, the best strategy is to watch the whales and follow suit. I can't win against a hedge fund trader, so I try to win with them.
But you wouldn't know any of this because you aren't a professional trader, or even a hobbyist. You're a dime-a-dozen shitty crypto "trader" who thinks they know the first thing about actually trading. 
So keep it up while the whales and algos walk all over your ass.

Stop spreading your salt everywhere. Just because I'm talking trading 101 (which is all this shit is, nothing esoteric about it) doesn't mean I'm acting like I know it all.
The fact is, I do know that this type of trading is legal. I also do know that spoofing is illegal. I also do know that it continues to happen anyway. I know this because I trade for a living.
You can be bitter about it if you want, or you can learn something.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:43:49
You bet
@_date: 2018-01-13 18:20:49
Says the person working on no information whatsoever?
I make a living doing this. I put my money down on scenarios like this everyday. I do pretty well. Everything is speculation, but some speculation is informed and more likely to yield correct predictions.
What exactly do YOU do for a living?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:36:39
That’s where all the 1080 ti’s went!
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:07:39
Another theory would be that an ETF with BTC underlying would make the BTC exchanges even sweeter targets for market manipulation and that the ETF would lose appeal and we’d be right back to futures anyway. Then again, no clear evidence that this happened with the introduction of futures, so I’m not sure why it would be more likely with an ETF.
All very interesting.
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:19:10
That is interesting. Think it’s because the futures are considered more trustworthy by industry players?
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:39:42
Alright, I won’t be upset with you.
As long as you send me one. $800 coming your way.
