First off, sorry for your loss.
Second, make sure your bitcoin is in a wallet you can control. Only risk or invest the amount that you are willing to lose. If you want to go really long term storage, a paper wallet with spray on preservative in a fire proof lockbox is probably what you want to have.
I've been buying BTC in small amounts, just $50 worth per paycheque from work. I keep some or it on my phone with Mycellium for buying games on Steam, the rest goes to my paper wallet.
I'm not saying my way is the right way to do it, especially since I don't do margin trading or anything, but bitcoin is still quite new and people are still learning how to handle it in a practical way.
Also, consider investing in some altcoins. As for the BFX tokens, try to think of them as representing money you've already lost. I wasn't affected by the BFX hack, but I would strongly consider holding onto them long term, and watch what happens with the various lawsuits. There will likely be new developments in this case.
Good luck!

If the internet got shut down, you still have the private keys to all of your bitcoin wallets. But you would lose all money in your bank account, and the fiat money in your pocket would be arguably useless.
The blockchain would be restored by consensus once the Internet is restored. The fiat money banking system, well, they would have their own consensus and you might not like it.

Unfortunately, the days of shoving a few old graphics cards in your computer and mining are over. ASICS are pretty much mandatory, and even then you have to consider what kind of operation you want to run. The mining difficulty increases with the hash power of the network, meaning you are in direct competition with all the other miners for every block. The block rewards have been lowered as well, which actually caused some miners to go offline until the difficulty lowered and price of Bitcoin made mining profitable again.
Don't be totally discouraged, as more miners means more decentralization, which is good for everyone. However, take the time to do some research, and don't expect to recover the costs of the hardware you buy right away.

You can offer to pay them in BTC, and send them a little extra BTC, and still save money by not paying the fee for sending USD.

I didn't lose anything in bitfiendx, but this whole thing is starting to feel like a stealth ponzi scheme. Maybe it wasn't a ponzi at first, but it's becoming one. Your BFX is worthless if Bitfinex does poorly, so you are incentivized to 'recruit' new customers and downplay the negative media for them now.
If you ever see Bitfinex try to use BFX for anything other than paying back money from the hack, then you'll know that their value as IOUs is about to drop.

This is a good question, although in this case it very obviously is a scam, it may not be so apparent in future cases. Creating some sort of watch dog entity or method of assurance for the safety of apps will be a difficult task that we will have to tackle as a decentralized community at some point. It will be a challenge to do this in a way that doesn't unfairly impede legitimate apps and services provided by new developers.
Unfortunately, it may soon be the case that we just can't trust new and unproven apps/devs until they've shown themselves to be useful and trustworthy.

This. The more interesting thing will be "which exchange will never be hacked for more than 5% of it's coins?"

It needs to be airgapped. Obviously an exchange will have some funds in a hotwallet for easy access, but as we saw with Bitfinex, the hotwallet is the low hanging fruit for thieves.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:17:47
The idea behind a paper wallet is just to print it out, and remove all traces of it from your computer so that the private key is only on paper. You can know for sure that you're leaving no trace of your paper wallet on the computer if you use a Linux LiveUSB for creating and printing the paper wallet. This way if you ever get hacked, then the private key on the paper wallet is still safe.
If you got a paper wallet file on your computer stolen already, then it's likely your computer has been compromised and you need to do a factory reset and/or reinstall OS.
There's also lots of hardware wallets. Trezor is a popular one.

Maybe I'm misunderstanding, so please correct me if I'm wrong, but the transaction compression of mimblewimble doesn't totally solve the privacy issue. Since anybody can still download the blockchain (a necessity if you're running a full node), then it's still also possible to take snapshots and archive transaction histories. Though, maybe doing so would be a good incentive for running a full node?

No. They "split" their coins without decreasing their apparent value. They promise you return on investments, yet there is no demand for OneCoin, no market, and no prices for it except for price they dictate. They also have a private blockchain, and you cannot directly access your wallet without signing into their servers with your username and password. It's entirely possible that they don't even use a blockchain, since we can't determine if it has any of the features a blockchain has and a normal database doesn't.


4 out of 5 people approve of gang rape. It's not likely that OneCoin will even reach that approval rate.

Someone claiming to be the hacker is asking for a 1:4 trade on bitcoin, give him 1 and he gives you 4.

There are a lot of options, but you have to keep in mind that major exchanges and traders will require some form of identification due to Anti-Money-Laundering/Know-Your-Customer laws and regulations. It's more difficult to find services that will sell you bitcoin completely anonymously, and they usually sell at a bit of a premium (due to the risk that they may be taking on criminal liability if you use your bitcoin for criminal purposes and in a way that can be traced back to them.)
You also have to keep in mind your privacy and anonymity is never guarunteed with bitcoin, but there are many things you can do to help preserve your privacy. Never re-use wallet addresses, never publicly post your bitcoin address for more than one person to send coins to, and look into privacy services like bitcoin tumblers that help prevent your coins from being traced. And of course, use TOR. Good luck.

This is troubling, but it's what happens when there are a lot of new people exposed to Bitcoin, like during the bull runs of the end of last year. There are ponzi scams, bitcoin doublers, bitcoin 'investing', and there's cloud mining. All are scams meant to extract as much money from as many other people as possible.
When engaging in a scam, even if you're somehow gaming the system to make a profit, there are 10 other people who lose money. It doesn't make you clever, it makes you complicit in the scam. The scammer is still making his profit while you make pennies due to someone else's misfortune.

Honestly, I think the network would suffer from getting two big changes at once. Segwit by itself already results in blocks being bigger, having an additional block increase at the same time as Segwit just seems to be asking for trouble.
It would have been better if activating segwit also activated a timer for hardforking segwit and a block size increase after a reasonable amount of time, like a couple of months.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:37:16
Increasing bock size is a linear scaling at best. Visa has a average minimum of 2,000 tx/s, while Bitcoin is currently doing 3-7 tx/s. To meet Visa's minimum, block sizes would have to be almost a gigabyte if no other scaling method was done. This might be reasonable in the future, but right now it's not.

This would totally compromise one of bitcoin's greatest strengths; immutability of the blockchain. And even if you make the agreement in advance for coins that you presume to be 'dead', you are pressuring the address owner to move their 'dead' coins to a new/more recent wallet address, thereby forcing them to put their security and privacy at risk if they can even get to a computer to do so.

Segwit would effectively be a minor block size increase (as much as 2.5 times depending on what types if transaction are included in a given block), while BU could potentially be a much larger increase based on consensus among the miners.
There's been lots of heated debate on both sides, but it's ultimately up to what the miners decide to implement and how well their mining pools support their preferred scaling method.
If you want to learn more, just keep in mind that this is a subject that has been debated for years, and there is a lot of bias and misinformation floating around.

They're cannibalizing bitcoin's value, so that two "Bitcoin"s will exist. One will be the Core network, and one will be the Unlimited Network. Since all previously existing coins will be on both networks, you will have two balances. All your Core Coins will also suddenly have BU clone coins.
Think like the episode of star trek, where they discover there's another version of themselves from a parrallel universe where they're all evil and have goatees. The parrallel universe happened because there was a fork in the timeline. So if you have one bitcoin when a blockchain hardfork happens, you will suddenly have two bitcoins, except one of those bitcoins will have a goatee.
Unfortunately, because everyone has more coins, and because of the uncertainty of people deciding which coins are the ones that 'count', the price will probably crash as hard as it did during the Mt Gox crisis.

It's a lot of fun to take that plunge; but just remember you're not investing, you're speculating; either the thing that you're holding will go up in value, or it will go down, and there's a lot of factors that determine the price.
There's a few great services that use your Coinbase account for selling and spending bitcoin, but to be safe you should take most if not all of your bitcoin off of Coinbase and into your own wallet. Electrum, Breadwallet, Mycelium are all well-reviewed software wallet clients, but do your own research before deciding which one you download. Software wallet clients (sometimes referred to as SPV clients) are a handy and convenient way to keep your bitcoin in your own control while being able to send and receive them. Most will be able to use HD wallets, which means your wallet address changes with each transaction to help preserve your privacy. Only problem with a software wallet is that it does not protect you from spyware, online attacks, or losing your device. For secure long-term storage, there are two good options:
1) Hardware Wallet device. Lots are available, Ledger Nano S is a popular one but again, do your own research to decide what is best for you. A good hardware wallet is one that can connect to your computer or smartphone to sync to the blockchain without exposing its internal storage to any other device. These devices will also usually have a backup seed, so that you can restore your wallet if your device gets damaged or lost; you'll want to keep this backup seed written in a secure place.
2) Print your own paper wallets. This might seem like the cheaper option; but to do it properly you'll want to buy a fire-proof lockbox or a safe, and maybe also some self-adhesive laminate. To produce some paper wallets, you'll want to set up a clean, offline computer environment by booting your computer with a linux live CD or USB session, like Ubuntu or Tails. Because it's not recommended to re-use addresses, print out a batch of empty wallets and store them so that they're ready to use. When you've saved up a reasonable amount of bitcoin on a software wallet (like 0.5 BTC or 0.25 BTC, for example), then send it to an unused paper wallet. It's important to note that you should keep all of your paper wallets in a safe and secure place, even if you haven't used them yet. More info on how to make paper wallets [here](

Absolutely. From the mycelium website: 


I have also restored multiple accounts before when switching devices, by entering a single backup seed you generate all the same HD accounts.
All HD accounts under a single device's mycelium installation are derived from the same key. Anyone can generate the same accounts if those accounts are based on the same seed. I'm pretty sure the app even says so when you're doing it.
When you restore a wallet with two or more HD accounts, Mycelium will only show the first one by default. You then press the 'add hd account' option, and then your mycelium wallet will generate your other accounts one by one.
@_date: 2017-03-27 16:06:28
Why not? If the fork happens, people will start dumping either coin before the price crash. BU devs don't really want people exposed to replay attacks for dumping their BTC, do they?
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:13:48
some services like Circle have already gone on record stating that they won't likely support more than one bitcoin. And even exchanges that do support it may not be totally protected from replay attacks.
It all boils down to how much you trust the online service that you've given your bitcoin to hold for you.
@_date: 2017-03-27 19:34:27
Assuming there will be a HF which is not yet certain; The price of both fork coins will drop substantially at the time of the fork. BU Devs will want the price of Corecoin to drop and BUCoin to rise. It is in their interest to facilitate a Corecoin dump by implementing replay protection. Corecoins would not dump as quickly if people have to take the extra precaution of splitting their coins, which would require an extra wallet hop and longer wait times since Core would have lost ~75% of the hashrate but the difficulty will not have changed.
Without replay protection, it will take longer for people to dump one or the other coin, and may lead some to simply holding both, which would slow the price change and give the minority chain a chance to comeback. Ironically, the 1MB blocksize limit works in Core's favour in this case by slowing down the dump.

That is effectively the case, when actions speak louder than words. We should have gotten a block size increase ages ago with segwit. However the miners seem to want a small block size increase first and *then* segwit which would lead to layer 2 solutions.
The situation where everyone would be happy is where we have larger blocks that are still mostly getting full, but people would also have access to layer 2 solutions when the mempool is congested.

As long as you have the private keys in your possession, like with a hardware wallet or a paper wallet, you'll be fine. When you want to retrieve your BTC and/or BTU, you just need to sweep the keys into two wallets, one that supports BTU and one that support BTC. Prefereably around the same time, and into different wallets that aren't using the same address, to prevent replay attacks. But there's no rush to do this, your coins will still be safe in cold storage.

Of course, it's still not clear if this fork will happen, and this might all just be FUD.
Either Bitcoin Core's Segwit soft fork will activate (which will be compatible with non-segwit nodes), or the BU hard fork will happen (which will NOT be compatible with non-BU nodes and divide the network). This tug of war between Core and BU has been going on for years, but it has to end eventually.

No, you would have to download a wallet app that supports BTU, and import your private keys into that. Breadwallet is open source, so if there were a fork, I'm sure there would be one or more BTU-Breadwallet's on the app store right away, which might allow you to 'restore' your backup seed. Then your BTU coins will show up there.
There are also other wallets that support multiple currencies, like Jaxx. I wouldn't be surprised if most if not all of them would automatically handle your BTU wallet like you say.
Most of my bitcoin is on paper wallets. If there were a fork, all I would have to do is sweep a paper wallet once with a BTC wallet, and then sweep again with a BTU wallet.

The screenshot is from a game called FTL, where you manage the crew of a small spaceship trying to travel across the galaxy to warn of an impending enemy attack. Currently, the ship appears to be hull breached, losing oxygen, and on fire, with all subsystems failing except for door controls, sensors, and (ironically) oxygen generation. They also appear to be facing an enemy who has not taken any damage.
It's actually a good little game with a lot of replayability, I would recommend it. It can be a bit frustrating at times, but being forced to micromanage your crew to deal with multiple crises aboard your ship is part of what makes the game fun.

You've clearly learned nothing from the Ethereum/DAO hardfork, then. It was also a hardfork that people had time to prepare for, and at least they knew for sure if and when it would happen. I expect Bitcoin exchanges will be a bit better prepared to protect against replay attacks, but it's not going to be 100%.
You know what is 100%? Controlling your own keys.
@_date: 2017-03-25 12:09:59


Let's say a fork happens and there's two active blockchains, we'll call them A and B.  When you send your coin on Chain A to someone shady, he or she has the ability to take your transaction and re-broadcast it on Chain B, so he or she gets both your ACoin and your BCoin when you only wanted to send your ACoin. This is called a replay attack.
Chances are, if you're a casual Bitcoin user and Chain A becomes the majority Blockchain, then you probably won't care about your BCoin since it will quickly become worthless. However, a lot of users will be in a rush to sell off their BCoin before it crashes, and when they do that their ACoin would become vulnerable to a replay attack. Alternatively, there's also a small chance that Chain B will make a comeback, and if you sent any ACoins then your BCoins might also be gone, and those stolen BCoins that you never meant to send would become a lot more valuable after Chain B became the majority chain.
Because Chain A and Chain B uses the same addresses, the only surefire way to protect yourself from a replay attack is to split your ACoin and your BCoin apart into two different wallet addresses. On the bright side, Breadwallet is open source, and I imagine if a fork did happen, then somebody might make a Breadwallet-B available to download and transfer your coins to if Chain B were the minority chain. Also I have no doubt that other multi-currency wallets like Jaxx would implement separate balances for ACoin and BCoin and also auto-generate a new key for each balance in the event of a contentious fork.

Honestly, keeping your most recent updates as closed source is akin to saying: *"we won't show you exactly what this code does until everyone else is also running it."* Any miner or node operator that needs to verify the code changes won't be able to, and will have to either shut down their node or maybe get exploited until the devs have decided it's 'safe' to reveal the code. Open source is about free dissemination of code as much as it is verifying what kind of code you are running. If developers are obfuscating what their code does, then you are forced to either trust them or to not use their code.
Trust by default shouldn't be an option, and that goes double for something that is supposed to be a consensus based network such as Bitcoin. Why would you run a cryptocurrency node that nobody has been able to vet? The code comes with no warranty or insurance, so as a node operator the liability is yours alone.

No. Bitcoin can only be 'created' or brought into circulation by one predetermined method: that is, a miner mines a block and includes a transaction that puts X number of bitcoins into the miner's wallet address. X is whatever the block reward happens to be, which was 50 BTC in the beginning and decreases with every "Halvening" (approximately every 4 years). Because of the halvenings, only 21 million BTC will exist. Any deviation from protocol produces what's considered an invalid block, and is simply ignored by the rest of the network. The block reward is currently 12.5 BTC, so it's a pretty strong incentive for miners to not waste their time making invalid blocks.

As pointed out, exchanges have to comply with KYC, AML, and CYA (respectively, Know Your Customer, Anti-Money Laundering, and Cover Your Ass). This is usually due to tax law as well as criminal liability laws.
Localbitcoins and other non-exchange meeting platforms usually are a good way to avoid all the paper work and AML stuff, and buy Bitcoin directly from a person. The only drawback is that the price tends to be a bit higher. Bitcoin ATMs tend to fall somewhere in between, sometimes requiring KYC/AML registration but it depends on availability and your local laws.

Bitcoin mining used to be on desktop computers with a couple of graphics cards, but these days you simply cannot make a profit in mining without first investing in thousands of dollars of mining ASICs (specialized computers hard wired to mine as efficiently as possible), as well as a cheap source of electricity.

He's talking about making private keys for long term storage. You don't need to destroy a computer, just make sure it's a clean software environment with hardware that can't leak or record your key generation process. This is important because if anyone gets your private key for your wallet, they can move your bitcoins to another own wallet.
If you're just getting started in bitcoin, you should buy small amounts at first just to get familiar with it. Transfer them to a software wallet for convenience, either on your computer or on your phone. If you decide to buy large amounts of bitcoin, you can either buy a hardware wallet (which come in several shapes, sizes, and brand names, costing between $50 - $300 USD), or you can store your bitcoin on a paper wallet for long term storage as explained above.

Not a bad idea. As long as you trust that bitaddress is secure and produces addresses with sufficient randomness. There's been lots said about that if you want to search Google or this subreddit and make up your mind for yourself, and if you're unsure there are other ways to generate address and private key pairs offline.
The only serious point of concern would be the security of the printer you are using, whether it caches the paper wallets it's printing, and whether you are connecting it to other devices when it's not air-gapped. Also, connecting to it with wifi is less than ideal, but unfortunately I'm pretty sure the s3 doesn't have an ethernet port.��
That's all I can think of for now. Another suggestion would just be to print out a buttload of empty paper wallets, and keep them in a secure location until you need to send bitcoin to them.

~~If nobody's doing it, the difficulty will go down and it won't cost that much electricity.~~ You know, I'm not sure if the difficulty will go down if all mining suddenly ceased. \*


They don't really have to, as long as some nodes sync on a semi-regular basis. Just means having more confirmations will be more important, and it will take much longer for transactions to be adequately confirmed to avoid accepting a transaction in an orphaned block.


People waiting for the Internet to come back?
\* POST-EDIT: difficulty re-adjusts every 2016 blocks, so if there was a massive crash in hashrate then it would take at least 2016 blocks before the difficulty is retargeted based on the available hash power. Difficulty would definitely go down, but only if somebody puts in the work for possibly 2016 blocks.

I'd take it with a grain of salt. The Blockchain needs nodes to maintain it's security and immutability. These nodes burn up energy, the more energy they burn up, the more secure it is. There's a lot of good applications for this, as well as a lot of bad applications for this. Those node operators need an incentive to run their nodes correctly and add valid blocks to the blockchain, that's what the mining reward is for.
So I guess my answer is that I don't know how it would work either. But any further research you find, try to look at with a critical eye. And whenever someone says "private blockchain" as a solution to something, then they probably don't understand blockchains. Private blockchains have no purpose except maybe for internal testing or debugging, and offer no advantages that any database doesn't.

It's digital money. You earn it the same way you can earn normal money. You can also buy some with your country's fiat currency at an exchange like coinbase or kraken, or on a local market site like localbitcoins, and that's how you can sell it as well.
Right now, the best use case for bitcoin is sending money internationally, but it also has a lot of other applications as well. Many people also buy it because as fewer and fewer bitcoins can be mined by miners, it's expected to grow in value. But of course there is always a risk. Just like anything, don't invest more than you're willing to lose. If you want to invest a lot, strongly consider buying a hardware wallet for the best security.

I guess. I imagine there will be some system to help young people and people with learning disabilities manage their cryptocurrency. There might already be a market for that now with multi-sig wallets that require the confirmation of both the user and the guardian, or a protected storage for wallet backups and backup seeds.
In the long run, Bitcoin will probably be a fundamental technology that we won't use directly, but rather with a standardized transaction interface. Wallet addresses and signatures will just be stuff that happens in the background.
I think Circle was trying to do this, their website and app used a slick and simple interface that encouraged the user to deal with contacts rather than wallet addresses. But they neutered their own efforts by stopping Bitcoin purchases.

The point I was trying to make was that an increasing number of transactions are being done not by full nodes, but by simple wallets that don't contribute to the network in any meaningful way. EDIT: except in transaction volume and tx fees.

It's nice, however you have to "load" the wallet with bitcoin before doing any purchases, which is stored as a USD balance (or other fiat currency) after being confirmed.

You could do that, but before the 'how' you should ask 'why'. Are you trying to create a polling system? What kind of weight are the signal votes supposed to have? What's to stop people from spamming votes by sending transactions to themselves?
Currently wallet users don't really 'support' anything blockchain related. It used to be that every wallet was also a full node, but that is no longer the case. So it's not clear what kind of support can be offered by a wallet user.

That's how I would think. Segwit is an attempt to use the available transaction capacity in a more efficient and flexible way. Not only will it make our current blocks more efficient, but it will make larger blocks even more efficient then they would have otherwise been. It just makes sense to scale for optimization before scaling for capacity.
We will need bigger blocks soon, but we need Segwit sooner.

The 12.5 BTC transaction is indeed the block reward transaction that the miner is allowed to make for itself. Trying to intentionally exclude any transactions to save CPU cycles is only marginally useful, and causes the miner to miss out on transaction fees. Though it may also be an indication that the miner has their minimum transaction fees set to high, perhaps unintentionally. Either way, not good business sense.
@_date: 2017-01-02 23:12:52
That's determined entirely by whoever is receiving the payment and what the payment is for. Like in my microwave example above, I might decide to wait for just a few confirmations after you bought my microwave before shipping it to you. Or if it's a really nice and expensive microwave, I might tell you that I'll wait for 6 confirmations before sending it to you, which might take a bit more time.
The higher the number of confirmations, the lower the risk, and the more likely I (as the bitcoin recipient) am not being targetted with a double spend attack where the person who sent the bitcoins tried to send the same bitcoins to someone else.
It's all about risk versus convenience. Waiting for only one or two confirmations is more convenient for the sender but slightly riskier for the recipient. Waiting for more is less convenient, but safer for large transactions. If you wait long enough, all valid nodes will eventually confirm your transaction, but it takes time for those changes to propogate throughout the network.

Your transaction should be confirmed by the entire network, as the nodes sync with each other. As long as your transaction was accepted by a miner (which is mostly determined by the transaction fee) then written into a valid block, it will eventually be accepted and confirmed by all nodes.
If you're recieving bitcoin, the number of confirmations is necessary to avoid being scammed by double spend attacks and is also a consequence of avoiding invalid blocks. For example, if I sold you my microwave then I would see the transaction immediately, but I would want to wait for at least a couple of confirmations before sending you my microwave. 6 is usually the recommended minimum, but it's totally up to the recipient of the bitcoin and the nature of the business.
If you're sending bitcoin, the only confirmation you need to care about is the first one, which represents the node of the miner that accepted your transaction. After that, other nodes will also confirm as long as that miner mined a valid block, which they recieve a strong incentive to do.

If you're a living person and not a hermit, you probably need to buy stuff to live. Instead of buying that stuff with fiat, consider buying it with bitcoin instead.

A normal playthrough can take 15 - 30 hours, even longer on the higher difficulty. You don't need to have played the first XCOM Enemy Unknown to enjoy XCOM 2.
It has cool cinematics, characters, and world building, but the plot is often seen as it's weakest point.
The tactics layer is very good without mods, it adds a few new game mechanics that weren't in the previous game, such as armor points and ambushes.
It looks great too, but it's surprisingly graphics intensive for a turn based game. I'm not surehow well it performs on XBox One, but on PC launch it definitely had some optimization problems.
If you're a dedicated console player and you think you'd like to just play through once or twice, then it's pretty good bang for your buck. However the PC scene is where it really shines with it's mod support. The team that made the Long War complete overhaul mod for XCOM EU/EW just recently announced that they would be making Long War for XCOM 2 as well. As far as we know the console versions will not receive modding support, although lots of players are still hoping that might change.
Last note, the multiplayer scene isn't dead, but it barely has a pulse. Don't expect to get into any multiplayer games unless there's a sort of meet up happening.

When your comfortable with it, then buy more, either all at once or a little at a time. Software wallets can be compromised by malware or spyware, and online 'wallets' are often under a third party's control, so when you decide to get large amounts of bitcoin, invest in a hardware wallet and/or educate yourself on how paper wallets work.
And be very aware, there are a lot of scams and ponzi schemes in the cryptocurrency space.

Until sellers start selling at a higher price. Or you could lowball it and put in a low buy order, but then you have to wait for all the higher buy orders to get sold to.
It's not so much the price that matters in choosing an exchange, but rather the fees, features, and convenience. There probably is some exchanges that tend to sell lower by a statistically significant margin or have a slightly wider spread, but then you have to compare other factors that affect your cost of doing business on those exchanges.

Altcoins tend to have different styles of development, different goals, and a different audience. Some are very broad like Bitcoin, while some are intended for a specific market. Many of them try to address some flaws in Bitcoin, but some people can confuse flaws with features so try to think critically about anything that claims to be "better" than Bitcoin. If you plan to invest in altcoins, research each altcoin on an individual basis.
Keep in mind, altcoin discussion tends to be frowned down upon in might be a better place to ask altcoin-specific questions.

Finney's pre-bitcoin history is pretty interesting enough on it's own. He got to work with Phil Zimmerman on PGP email encryption, back before it was open sourced. I bet he learned a lot when seeing Zimmerman being brought to court over selling PGP online. When Zimmerman was accused of selling encryption to foreign entities, he open sourced it and got into even more trouble.
I would not be surprised if Finney was Satoshi, or at least had a hand in creating the Satoshi persona, based onbhis experience both in the technical and legal side of being a cypherpunk.

I mean, it could if there was enough incentive to switch to a less efficient hashing model. But you would also have to prove that someone doesn't have an exclusive and faster method of calculating whatever the result needs to be; miners don't like being on an uneven playing field as we have seen with the drama surrounding the covert ASICBOOST.
I mean, it would be super cool if the miner community was just taken over by scientists trying to better humanity with the available hashpower, but as soon as someone finds a way to make the solution trivial then it would screw up the whole network. The current proof of work is pure math, not based on physical world science, so there is less danger of someone finding a way to trivialize it.

I understand the 'how', I'm just questioning the 'why'. Cash is nice, but the Fed isn't going to issue their own currency backed by another currency they can't control.
But after having given this some thought, there might be a private bank that prints it's own physical currency which can be exchanged for Bitcoin, if someone can come up with a good profit model for that to offset the cost of printing/fabrication/anti-counterfeit measures.
@_date: 2017-01-11 16:34:26
Same way the fed pays for any of its reserve currencies, with other money. It's up to them how much they want as a reserve currency.
Here, the Bank of Canada keeps USD, gold, and a collection of other currencies in its reserves. They could easily decide to buy however much bitcoin and keep it in cold storage. Personally I think they should, since not only would it help legitimize BTC in Canada and around the world, but it might help the struggling Canadian dollar.
I don't think the US really needs to worry about a reserve currency, though having more reserves would further increase the confidence of foreign investors. For other countries, a major reason for having reserves is in the case where your own currency starts to slide down in value. Paying other countries is necessary for debt at some point, but doing it with your own currency while your currency is sliding down can diminish the value even further if nobody wants to get paid with it.
@_date: 2016-12-22 21:53:17
It is easy to convert, you can sell it or trade it on an exchange. I'd really recommend selling only what you need to get by, and try to hold onto the rest. Bitcoin is collected by 'miners', but it's limited in supply and will eventually stop being created. Although there will be some peaks and dips in the price, the value is expected to go up over the long term.
Bitcoin is also accepted by an increasing number of vendors online, and it doesn't cost any extra fees to send bitcoin from country to country.

The coinbase wallet is not yours, but rather coinbase's wallet, associated with your account. Just like any other exchange or online service, if coinbase locks your account or you get into a dispute then you may not be able to withdraw your BTC. For convenience, you can download a wallet app on your computer or smartphone and transfer your btc to that. Dedicated device like a hardware wallet is generally recommended for large amounts as hardware wallets are much safer from malware that can steal your bitcoin. There's also paper wallets, though they're less convenient and are only safe to use once.
Private keys are important and should never be shared. How and whether you use them depend on what type of wallet you use. HD wallets like Breadwallet and Mycelium manage your private keys for you, but you still have a backup seed to save and protect.
@_date: 2017-08-11 16:30:42
I agree, cash is nice,and the war on cash by the governments of the world is one of the reasons that bitcoin exists.
But I don't see what incentive the Fed would have in accumulating BTC in order to print BTC backed notes, and I don't see the incentive for people to *not* trade those notes back to the Fed so they could get Bitcoin that can't be counterfieted, or double-spent after being ccommited to the blockchain. A BTC-backed note would be less secure.

Correct, in theory. In practice, that remains to be seen. The intrinsic value means nothing if it's only exchanged for fiat currency.
Which brings me back to my original point, you can buy and hold bitcoin while spending your fiat, but it would be better to buy MORE bitcoin and spend bitcoin instead of fiat whenever possible. This would increase the value of bitcoin more than simply hoarding.

Coffee is just one use case, and is often used as an example since it's simple and easy to understand.
Something similar would be microloans, which are very small loans aimed at people in impoverished regions of the world and highly populated cities. The idea is that a microloan can be lent to someone who just needs some help getting by until their next paycheque, and in certain regions of the world even just $5 USD is enough to feed one's family for a week, for example. Since the loan is a very small one, the lender is not risking that much, but failure to repay the loan would cut off the lendee from making further microloans.
However, the transaction fees make microloans unfeasible using Bitcoin directly. So if, for example, India suddenly became a cashless society, a microloan system couldn't be implemented directly on the blockchain as it is now.

No need to make it sound mysterious. The transaction is in the mempool of mining nodes until it's included in a block. And it is possible to use unconfirmed coins if you use a higher tx fee, any miner that wants that higher tx fee also needs to include the previously unconfirmed tx in the same block.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:50:16
Computers and smartphones have lots of software wallets available, though if someone can access your computer or phone then they could access the bitcoin on it, and malware exists that is capable of stealing bitcoin. If you keep bitcoin on your phone, think of it like cash in your pocket, and consider how much you'd be willing to risk walking down the street with. Ideally, using a dedicated computer or android device that is used exclusively for financial information and not for things like gaming and web browsing would be the best if you want a software wallet: this would also give you the option of running your own node if you wish. Most software wallets use HD addresses, meaning your wallet address changes each time it's used to help protect your privacy: HD wallets' addresses are determined by a master seed which you will want to backup somewhere safe.
For decent security on the cheap [paper wallets]( can be made. For the best security, try to print paper wallets offline **edit: and generate paper wallets** with your computer booted into Linux liveCD/liveUSB. Like with all static addresses, you should only send bitcoin to it once, so if you go this way you may as well print a batch of empty wallets ready to use as you see fit. Paper wallets take a bit of work to create, and you also have to keep the paper safe and make sure the ink doesn't fade.
For best security and ease of use, you can also purchase a hardware wallet. Popular ones include Trezor or the Ledger Nano. Since you're starting out with small amounts, this may be something you want to consider later on. I'd reccomend this over paper wallets since you had a large amount on paper, then you'd be spending almost as much money on laminating and fireproof lockboxes anyway.

It's more of an "A implies B" statement, whichdoesn't necessarily mean "If not A, then not B".

So really this just means "If the devs go for it, then we go for it, otherwise we will follow the market".

Heck, I'd argue that the "super-wealthy" should be fine to collect as much crypto as they want. Cryptocurrency removes the systems of human oversight that encourage corruption and nepotism; the things that make people super-wealthy will not help them as much in a purely bitcoin-based economy. The Super-Wealthy want to use their crypto, and so they will distribute it if they want to take advantage, but since it can be infinitely divisible, they don't have to.

If I had to break it down, I'd say there were three critical steps:
-Create the wallet on a clean and reliably random software environment, not connected to the Internet, that leaves no trace on the host machine. The private key should never reside on a network-connected machine in any way since the whole point of a paper wallet is to keep your private key offline.
-only send one transaction to the new wallet for maximum security. It has been shown that making multiple payments to the same single-address wallet might make it possible to deduce the private key. Pay to it once, and then when you're ready sweep it once, then toss your used up paper wallet.
-keep the paper wallet somewhere safe and secure where nobody will see it. Ink-jet printers tend to work better than laser for long-lasting ink. Stick-on laminate is also quite useful. Fireproof lockboxes can be a good investment, whether it's for paper wallets or backing up the master seed for a hardware wallet.
Whatever works and how closely you follow these steps depends entirely on how you judge your situation to be. You don't have to follow ultra-religious op-sec if you're only saving 2 USD worth of bitcoin to a wallet, and a fireproof lockbox can only go so far in protecting it from a dedicated thief or your son/brother/housekeeper. Everyone has their own standards of security, the important part is knowing what your options are for maximum security, and then deciding which compromises are worth taking for your use-case.
@_date: 2016-12-23 00:08:49
For reliably secure cold storage that doesn't get lost forever if you're hit by a bus, consider doing this; divide your key into three parts. Give parts 1 and 2 to your wife, parts 2 and 3 to your mother and parts 1 and 3 to your lawyer. Instruct them to never share their key portions unless you're 6 feet under. Secure with backup redundancy, since it requires 2 of 3 parties to cooperate to recover your key with their key portions.
(If necessary, replace those three people with whoever or whatever three entities you trust the most and that can also stay isolated from eachother)

If it's true that net neutrality will be totally scrapped: It won't render bitcoin inoperable, but it would definitely complicate things and probably make VPNs and/or TOR more of a necessity.
Many ISPs will be pushing their own partnered video-on-demand services, giving them an advantage over already established platforms like Netflix and YouTube. Then of course HTTP traffic will be given priority after that, possibly on a per-domain basis. Then after that, almost everything else. Protocols known to cause trouble will almost certainly be throttled or eliminated: this includes torrents, DC and other file-sharing protocols, IRC, and other more niche protocols.
This also opens the possibility that ISPs may "package" access to Internet access. For example, basic access may mean you only get access to Google, MSN, Facebook, and a select group of other domains; advanced packages may include other domains; and if you're willing to pay top dollar you can have access to as much of the Internet as your ISP is willing to give you. Think of the way your Cable or Satellite provider packages your channel subscriptions.
It also opens the door for bigger Deep Packet Inspection, which means more threats to privacy aside from what protocols you are using.
In short: it's going to be a bad four years to be an Internet user. Most of the above is worst-case scenarios, which means if we're lucky, it will only apply to Comcast subscribers.

Close but not quite. Your transaction is only written on one block, the miner who mined it says "hey, look at my block, I put all these transactions on it". That's your first confirmation. Every confirmation after that is all the other nodes double checking the miner's work to make sure it's valid. Only one blocks needs to be mined to confirm your transaction, but it's up to the miner if they will include your transaction or not in their current block.
Having more blocks come after your transaction does also improve your security in other ways, but doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the number of confirmations your transaction gets.

Yep. If you wanted to do the piggy bank approach, the best way to go would be to make a new paper wallet for every new deposit, and physically store them together or separate somewhere safe. Addresses were never meant to be re-used.
Other approaches would be to use an HD software wallet which generates a new address/privkey pair for each transaction(breadwallet, mycelium, and many other software wallets do this for you), or to use a wallet that has "stealth" addresses (which is a recieving-only address that obfuscates the wallet's real address, I don't know enough about this to make a particular recommendation, though).
Be safe, and good luck!

It could also be hardforked (or softforked?) so that bitcoins are even more highly divisible, and halvenings could keep going practically forever. We don't have to reach 21 million. I think that would be a much more interesting and desirable approach to the coin supply limit, but obviously that will depend on what the bitcoin ecosystem looks like in 92 years; it might be vastly different from the bitcoin we know now.

Your edit is accurate. In fact, it would be treated the same as any block containing a malformed tx; their version of the blockchain would be accepted by whatever nodes considered it valid, until there was a longer valid chain offered by other nodes.
Just treated like any other attack on the blockchain that affected only certain versions/implementations.

There you go again. What will be a reasonable amount of time to move 1 BTC 96 years in the future? You can't know how much 1 BTC will even be valued at 96 years in the future, so you can't make a value judgement on the cost of security that far ahead either.
The constant ad hominem attacks and insults only discredit you further. I never suggested we should assume it will be sufficient.

Things like that do not affect past transactions at all, it only affects the way future blocks are made and added to the blockchain.
The only thing that would affect previous bitcoin transactions is a rollback done as a hard fork, and there would have to be a consensus among miners for that to happen, since nodes will always accept the longest valid chain as the correct one. That's a big part of what makes the bitcoin blockchain immutable.
@_date: 2016-12-21 23:31:34
It shouldn't. It's either valid as a segwit transaction (in which case it's safely ignored by non-segwit nodes), or it's valid as a non-segwit transaction (acknowledged by all nodes), or it's not valid at all.
However, just considering that an edge case like this might exist as a bug is all the more reason to reach a near-consensus like 95%, having everyone using the same feature set prevents conflicts like this from ever happening.

I think he means made-up transactions between addresses that the miner controls, but I could be mistaken.

You're probably looking for this: 
Fun fact: the bitcoin reward was 50 bitcoins for the genesis block, just like any other block from before the first halving. But since the genesis block was hardcoded, that first 50 bitcoin is unspendable, so Satoshi couldn't move it to another address even if he/she/they wanted to.
The first transaction didn't even happen until block 9.
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:36:40
The ethereum guys are still working out the kinks with PoS. The thing about PoS is your chance of getting the transaction reward depends on how much coin you already have, so it's kind of modeled on the "trickle-down" effect (aka Reaganomics), because the rich get richer but need to distribute their currency for it to be valuable.
Someone more versed in PoS than I can probably point out where I'm wrong, but that's my understanding. It might work in theory, but I don't think it really works in a world where other currencies (fiat or crypto) already exist.

Nope. As long as your BTC is on your coinbase account, consider it like paypal. They reserve the right to deny you access to your funds if your account gets flagged or if they don't like the way you're using your bitcoin.
For example, if you use your BTC to pay for gambling or certain adult sites, they might close your account. You can avoid this by transferring your BTC to a wallet you control, and also by using bitcoin tumblers or other anonymizing services.
Your bitcoin is only truly yours if it's in a wallet to which you alone control the private keys.

I am sceptical of 2X because we are just now activating segwit. I'm concerned that node operators are just now starting to deal with the block size changes and upgrades that come with segwit, vendors and service providers are just now getting to experiment with how they can use segwit transactions differently than non-segwit txs on the real network and not the testnet. Things will break and have to be fixed with segwit. Doubling the block size after they've already been moderately increased by segwit will only add more strain to the network.
I prefer segwit. I would have been okay with doubling the block size. But doing both at the same time is reckless.

The cost of which is either a small fee or priced into the conversion rate. After enough transactions in Bitcoin, it just makes more sense to simply hold a bitcoin balance, and once businesses do that they'll prefer to spend Bitcoin themselves rather than convert to fiat.

Yep. Back then mining could be done by running a full node on any old desktop pc because there was very little hashpower competing for the block reward. As competition grew, people started buying up multiple GPUs to maximise hashpower on their computers. It wasn't until much later that mining pools and ASIC miners became a thing.
It's actually kind of important that blocks be mined on a regular basis, whether or not there were transactions. This helps preserve/enforce immutability, by saying there was a certain period of time where NO transactions happened. This can happen if not very many people are making transactions, but it can also happen if a mining pool just gets lucky by mining two or more blocks in quick succession.
@_date: 2016-11-28 13:24:31
You also have to consider the values involved. The 500 and the 2000 ruppee notes are currently the largest notes in India, when they're actually roughly $7.50 and $30 USD, respectively. The average Indian doesn't need large amounts of bitcoin.

This is a really interesting question. But unfortunately, just by looking at transaction history it's hard to tell when Bitcoin is being lost and when bitcoin is just being stored long term. Maybe after Bitcoin goes mainstream and we have a better population, we can analyze transaction activity and then look at a given wallet to say whether it was likely 'lost' or simply hasn't been spent yet.
@_date: 2016-12-10 14:05:28


Absolutely agree. What's the point in smart contracts when they require people to fork the chain? Why not just have contracts enforced by people at that point? The 'Code is law' school of thought was on the right track, Vitalik just played right into the DAO Hacker's hands.

Yes. You would have to do this one of three ways though:
1) swipe and go with zero confirmations. Risky depending on what type of store you're talking about.
2) swipe and go with an additional layer like LN, something to help legitimize TXs when they can't be immediately confirmed by regular nodes.
3) an additional risk management. This can be done by the store with a prepaid store credit, or by a third party that keeps a percentage of the TX (which isn't really that different from the system that banks and credit card companies currently enjoy). This would obviously require some level of KYC and de-anonymize the TX.
It would be technically possible but very unlikely to work with the current infrastructure, but it would make more sense to have cheap POS IoT devices for this purpose.

has a weird cognitive dissonance when it comes to mining, discouraging new miners and then complaining when miners get started.
If you're going to mine, I'd say you should treat it like a business. Come up with a 5 year plan, with contingencies (what will you do if you fall short of profit? At what point to do end things? What upgrade path could you watch for the future?)
I don't know enough about mining to suggest anything in particular, but just devote a certain amount of time per week to keeping things running and competitive, and you should be fine. Maybe even consider taking out a business loan, this is a business venture after all. Good luck!

Purely speculation on my part, but I imagine it will reach $1000, and then there will be bit of a sell-off. There is quite a bit of pumping going on, and there will be a dump. However, after the hype dies down and the price stabilizes, it will go no higher than $1,200 at a more gradual pace near the end of January.
Bitcoin has been above $1000 right before crashing stupendously. People will consider that during the sell off, and there won't be the panic spiral we saw before; more people will be holding on long term and not panic selling.
But then again, I'm an optimist. The scaling debate will once again rear its ugly head, and people will sober up and think critically about bitcoin once more. It's then that the markets will decide if bitcoin can make it in thr mainstream or continue to be a niche curiousity.

That's how the system works though. It is however in their interest to preserve the integrity of the blockchain, and keep each other honest. Nobody is forcing them to include transactions in their blocks, but most miners would like to have the fees. If some miners feel that they can profit more in the long term by declining transactions, they have a right to do it. But by doing so, they're opening up for other miners to snatch up those transactions and fees, so they might be all for nothing.
Miners are incentivized to help the network, but they can't be forced to.

It's possible that they would simply be mining more blocks to vote for or against something. I don't believe this to be the case currently since the only major vote happening is Segwit, but we may see a day when miners attempt to control more of the vote by mining more blocks than their actual hashpower should allow.
@_date: 2016-12-26 14:39:37


It would mean for the miners, the block reward would be progressively smaller slices of the 21 millionth coin plus the fees, instead of just fees.


Increasing the cap, maybe even just talking about it, may negatively impact the market and devalue coins that already exist. By not respecting the limit, Bitcoin would lose its deflationary nature, and I don't believe that will be in anyone's interest.

Nothing "gives" you bitcoin because bitcoins aren't things you can have. When someone says they have bitcoin on their phone or on their coinbase account or on their paper wallets, what they're really saying is that they have the private keys, digital codes to prove that a wallet they control was involved in transactions that resulted in them having a certain amount of bitcoins. If someone else gets control of your private keys, they can take control of your bitcoins.
When a miner mines a block, what it's really doing is adding a bunch of transactions to the blockchain. By convention, the first transaction in a new block is "put X number of bitcoin into the miner's wallet address", where X is the current block reward. As long as it's done in a way that follows the protocol, other full nodes and mining nodes will accept that as a valid block, and add it their version of the blockchain. The block reward started at 50 BTC, and over the past few halvenings is now at 12.5 BTC. This amount is usually split up between a group of people running mining nodes together in a pool.
If a miner said "maybe I don't want 12.5 bitcoins from this block, maybe I want to give myself a billion coins," they could also do that. But then almost every node in the world would say "That doesn't follow the protocol we agreed on," and nobody would accept that block as valid. A block is only valid if the transactions it contains are considered valid by everyone else.

It's a digital cryptographic money system, usable by anyone and (mostly) outside of government control. Transactions happen directly peer-to-peer, and are confirmed by a global network of nodes that maintain a massively distributed data structure known as the Blockchain. Though they're divisible up to 8 decimal places (technically more), only a finite number of bitcoins will be produced. As time goes on and scarcity is slowly introduced, BTC (or XBT as some exchanges denote it) is expected to increase in value.
It's not a perfect system, there are people that will try to scam you, and it's sometimes threatened by governments and banks that believe they need to regulate it (in many ways, it is already self-regulating). But it's actively developed open source software and has proven to be a good store of value, and can quickly and cheaply be used to send cash between countries.
Before you buy any large amounts, learn how wallets and private keys work. Avoid so-called bitcoin doublers, cloud mining, pyramid schemes, and other types of scams. Sign up for an exchange, and only purchase what you're willing to lose. Stay informed, and good luck.

It's actually kind of difficult to do this by accident. The address has to be valid, and has to actually have a private key that exists. If the address you typed in isn't a real address, there is a checksum that fails and the transaction never happens.
However, it is possible for some online exchanges to not check for this, in which case the exchange should know if it still has the bitcoin or not.

My guess? By declining to include transactions, they increase the mempool. By increasing the mempool, they encourage spenders to use higher fees. Maybe when the fees are high enough for them to be satisfied, then they'll include the transactions.
That's pure speculation on my part, though. The bottom line is, if it's being done intentionally, it's because they believe that they'll profit from it in some way or another. It costs just as much to mine an empty block as it does a full block, but a full block gives the miner the tx fees, so I dunno.
EDIT: Apparently I was wrong, mining empty blocks does give a very slight advantage in mining the next block.

It would not 'split' the chain, but it would introduce needless complexity. Non segwit nodes would ignore segwit transactions as non-standard even though the blocks are still valid. With certain outputs being ignored by certain nodes, a malicious spender could use segwit and non-segwit outputs in one transaction, and then attempt to doublespend with only the non-segwit output in another. It also means if nodes decided to revert the decision to use segwit, then many if not all segwit transactions could be lost. They've thought about implementing this carefully and mitigating the risks involved, but without consensus even a soft fork can cause problems.

Meh... it's probably going to happen at some point, only hardcore users will using and sending Bitcoin directly, and most other users will be using another simpler layer on top of Bitcoin. However, I think Circle's biggest mistake is taking away the direct access, and trying to force its customers to do it their way. Now that they've stopped selling or buying Bitcoin, they're not that different from paypal or venmo.
Trying to do a walled garden approach isn't going to work. Circle loses the biggest advantages of Bitcoin if they try to control all of it behind the scenes. Customers need private key level access, and to be able to transfer crypto to their non-Circle wallets.
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:36:24
Depends on a few factors, such as hash difficulty, average fee prices, and mining competition. The question you have to answer as a competitive miner is whether it's smarter to collect the fees which you know you can have, or skip the fees and go for the possible block reward on the next block. If the cost of ignoring fees no longer justifies the statistical advantage gained, then the miner would go back to collecting fees. They most likely use an algorithm to look at available fees and change strategies when it suits them.
That's all assuming they're looking to maximize profit. Alternatively, they could rather be maximizing blocks mined without regard to profit.

The people who bought the bcash during the dip are probably hyping it up so that they can sell it for Fiat or BTC. The reality is that bcash is stuck in the past, so it has no real future as a technology, it's just a short term trick to part fools from their money.

This is not unexpected. Hash functions by their nature are non-random; given enough time any hash function will be found to have enough short-cut exploits to be considered insecure. SHA256 as well as any other hash function is only living on borrowed time.


It's entirely likely that they WILL be able to continue to use the exploit, but since the parameters have changed, they'll just need to update the ASIC chipset. Segwit doesn't change the hash algorithm, so the exploit still exists. If anything, segwit might just help Jihan sell more ASICs.

That's right. There is big 'B' Bitcoin which is used to refer to the protocol and the network of nodes. Then there are little 'b' bitcoins, which are the units of currency used on that network.
Part of the protocol says that when a miner adds transactions to a block, the miner is 'allowed' to make the first transaction a payment of bitcoin to a wallet address generated by the mining node, of up to a certain amount that is the block reward. If they give themselves too much, then it's not considered a valid block by the rest of the network, and the block ends up getting orphaned. It's also possible for a miner to include no block reward transaction, in fact it has happened in the past: and the bitcoin from those missing block rewards will never be in circulation.
@_date: 2017-04-20 00:39:09


No. Choosing segwit means that further blocksize increases may be slightly more complicated for miners, but it's far from impossible.

I also don't know why you keep referring to them as 'hired' workers, because no person hired them.

75% isn't a real consensus. Consensus is 100%. The point of consensus is that everybody agrees. 95% was chosen for Bitcoin because it's reasonably close to consensus, and accounts for the small amount of miners who just don't bother to upgrade their nodes to a version that supports segwit.

Suppose you live in an anarchist society. Even without laws or morals, I think you'd agree that 99% of the time, you'd probably prefer not to commit murder out of rational self-interest; because if you commit murder then someone may decide to murder you, either out of revenge or out of the percieved threat that if you murdered once you may do it again. It was never codified in any way, but it was understood, and in that way becomes a social contract.
Cooperating with others out of mutual self interest is the social contract. For another example, just as much as running a node while accepting valid blocks from other miners is a social contract, one that is codified in the software you are running. The UASF is a social and technical response to a percieved breakage in the current social contract.
In an objective sense, you're correct that social contracts don't exist, any more than things like abstract maths and languages don't 'exist'. But they do exist between people that have an understanding with each other out of mutual self interest.

Also, it really also depends on what sort of product you are buying, they may decide if you are willing to pay $500 for an art piece on credit, you should be willing to pay for it in Bitcoin.

Jaxx uses an HD wallet system. 




It will continue to generate new addresses based on the master seed every time you send or receive bitcoin. The master seed is sometimes also referred to as the backup seed, because that's how you restore an HD wallet (so make sure you have it written down somewhere safe that nobody else can get to!)
Most mobile wallet apps use HD wallets, but not all master seeds are compatible with all wallets.

A cryptographic signature can be done a few different ways, but they all involve you using a private key (known only by you) to encrypt something that can be decrypted with a public key which is known by everyone. This is also how PGP encrypted mail works.
Since bitcoin uses pubkey privkey in various ways, you can for example make a transaction that gets added or mine a block on the blockchain; and the privkey you used in that transaction can also be used to sign a message. This proves that the signed message came from the same person that made that transaction or mined that block associated with that pubkey. This is also related to the concept behind 'Proof of Existence' which was popular as a blockchain application a few years ago.

I would never buy a private key with bitcoin on it, since there's no way to prove that the creator of the key wallet pair didn't keep a copy of their own.
This was a major criticism of the casascius coins back in the day, it was cool to have a "physical bitcoin", but it was essentially just a paper wallet on a gold coin. People only bought it because they trusted the guys making them.
As for taxes, if it came to a court decision then I don't think it would make a difference if you were selling bitcoin or selling a wallet with bitcoin on it. Not sure uf there's precedent but I'm sure they'd consider how gift cards and such are exchanged and used in lieu of money, and would consider a bitcoin address to be the same as the balance of a bitcoin address in terms of value.

The assumption being made here is that everybody would switch over to BCH if the BTC chain 'slowed down' and got higher fees. It's not really clear why the author thinks that when there are many other mature and solid altcoins available. BCH saw never anything more than a pump and dump, free money for people who wanted to keep their pre-fork bitcoins. ETH, litecoin, monero, etc. This article only exists to encourage people to buy more BCH before the S2X fork happens (which will be the next pump and dump).

What you're describing is a zero conf transaction. The transaction is sent out, and the receiving wallet holder can see that, but it hasn't been confirmed by any nodes. There's a few different solutions to this, but unfortunately none of them are as convenient or reliable as simply snapping a QR code at check out and then just leaving without waiting for a couple of confirmations.
The current best solution in the grocery would be to buy store credit with bitcoin when entering the store, shop around for 10 minutes or longer, and then pay with store credit which should be a confirmed purchase at that point. Still not really ideal.

PGP inventor Phil Zimmerman was caught in a long-standing courtroom battle with the US government, who claimed that his selling of PGP online was the equivalent of exporting munitions to foreign entities. This later prompted him to release a free version of PGP, which actually got him into even more trouble. He was eventually successful in defending his case, with the help of MIT and various other organizations who provided legal and financial support.
So, I'm pretty sure if a government entity (US or otherwise) is going to make a stink about encrypted mail, it's going to make even more of a stink about encrypted money. Fortunately for Satoshi and for us, he can't be used to attack Bitcoin any more since his disappearance.

Turns out Satoshi wasn't some Oracle. Nobody is. I think part of the reason Satoshi 'disappeared' is not only to protect himself, but also to remove his own influence from Bitcoin. He could have been a benevolent dictator for Bitcoin development like Linus Torvalds is for Linux, but at a certain point he knew that Bitcoin was going to be too big for one person to have authority over. He knew he was a fallible human being, so he removed himself from the equation, and maybe he planned that all along.

There is a built in checksum that most wallet apps use to prevent you from sending bitcoins to invalid addresses.

Nothing wrong with Coinbase, but if Coinbase is holding your bitcoins and something happens to Coinbase, you aren't guaranteed to get your bitcoins into a wallet you control. Exchanges have went under in the past, and ended up burning their customers. Look up Bitfinex and Mt. Gox, probably two of the biggest examples though there are others.

In the early days of Bitcoin, mining could be done with desktop computers, usually with powerful graphics cards because graphics cards are useful for doing many of the same type of calculation at the same time. These days, all mining is done by ASICs, which are a special type of dedicated computer. Unlike a graphics card in your desktop which can make many different types of calculations, Bitcoin ASICs are specifically hardwired to solving the hashing algorithm used for mining. They will continue to be necessary when segwit is activated, because we will need to keep mining blocks.
You might be confused with something called ASIC-BOOST which is a proprietary method of skipping some steps of the block creation process. This is considered an exploit, because it allows only certain miners to mine blocks faster, and makes it appear to the network that they have more hashpower than they actually do. When segwit is activated, however, covert ASIC-BOOST in it's current form won't work.

Maybe I phrased that poorly. To send bitcoin you obviously need the sender's private key, and the reciever's wallet address to create the transaction.
The wallet address has a checksum to show that it's a valid address. Nodes and SPV wallets use this checksum to ensure you're not accidentally sending to an invalid address. However, burn addresses also have this checksum, even though they are falsely validated. As says, unlike a regular wallet address, a burn address has no associated public/private key pair; so the bitcoin sent to a burn address is unspendable because there is no private key to find. Whether an address is a real burn address or not can be mathematically verified.
1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE just happens to be one of the more famous examples of this, but there are many others.

There has been many attempts at compromise. But Core can't force an upgrade on miners, nor should they have that power.
Also, segwit already increases that block size by it's nature of including more transactions depending on the types of transactions. An explicit block size increase would have to happen after, and not during, the segwit activation.
The main reason segwit is being stalled by some miners  is because of ASICBOOST, which leverages an exploit that segwit would fix.

Satoshi Nakamoto was the original creator of bitcoin, and author of the whitepaper. He successfully remained anonymous throughout Bitcoin's early development, and so nobody knows who he/she/they really are. He was thought to be Japanese, but nobody really knows where in the world he came from or where he went.
There's possibly two reasons he disappeared;
1) being the creator he must have thought he would have an undue amount of influence and didn't want to become a leader since that would run counter to his goal of a decentralized currency.
2) he expected that being the inventor of the first widely successful cryptocurrency (there have been other attempts before), he would be a target of government coercion or attacks, much like the inventor of PGP encrypted email was.
There are other theories, such as Satoshi dying or becoming a political prisoner in his country. None of these can be discounted, but I choose to believe that Satoshi is simply in hiding, and may not even be directly involved in Bitcoin anymore.
In the past, there has been people who have been 'outed' as Satoshi, though not with any real proof. There's also been people who have claimed to be Satoshi, though not with any real proof. The Satoshi Nakamoto story is a pretty good one, but you should be extremely skeptical of any claims since there are no good motives for anyone wanting to be Satoshi.

is actually correct, the public key and private key are generated at the same time, but rather it's the wallet address that is derived from the public key. The wallet address is what you're using to send bitcoin to another address, and contains a checksum to help avoid sending to invalid addresses. The burn address is a rare wallet address that, through an accident of math, shows as valid but could never have a private key associated with it.
There are mathematical reasons why the Eater address could not have a private key, because a wallet address is not a public key. There are a few other burn addresses like it.

Segwit helps to prevent transaction malleability, which is a way to attack unconfirmed transactions. Segwit also is useful but not necessary for off-chain scaling solutions such as Lightning, which would an opt-in scaling improvement to transaction throughput of the whole network. Segwit alone also increases the block size a small amount, meaning a little more stress on low-bandwidth nodes but more transactions per block.
For more info, check out the Core dev's segwit FAQ. 
Most of the people against segwit are people who don't trust Core (for various reasons, mostly conspiracy theories), or are against off-chain scaling solutions (even though segwit itself is not an off-chain scaling solution, and actually improves on-chain scaling by increasing the block transaction limit).

It's going to be one of the most high-profile pump and dumps in a while. Most people who focus on Bitcoin haven't really seen the pump and dumps in the altcoin space.
When a fork happens, there will be a small window of time where the value of BCC will be in free-fall, and people might actually buy some BCC before it hits rock bottom and dies. The more BCC gets hyped up, the more time BTC holders have to sell their newly created altcoins after the fork.

As much as I hate G2A's shoddy business practices, I kind of hope that their acceptance of Bitcoin forces the more legit stores to accept it as well. Steam accepting bitcoin is already a huge step forward.
For those that aren't aware, G2A is a pretty well known fence for re-selling defrauded steam keys bought with stolen credit cards. The credit card companies reverse the charges, so the developers get no money but the re-sellers can keep and sell the keys at a fraction of the cost.

It spends a good half of the book on the history and fundamentals of code, going back to the Ceaser Cipher, to the Navajo Code talkers of world war 1 and the German Enigma Machine of world war 2. Then he talks about modern computer network encryption, how digital code has been influenced by encryption and steganography of the analog world. He goes in depth about how and why modern cryptography works the way it does, and why certain forms of encryption are better than others for different purposes.
If there's a fault with the book, it's a little bit out of date, since it was published more than a couple of years ago. But that doesn't matter so much, because a lot of the subject matter is timeless, and gives you a good fundamental understanding of the evolution of the theory of crypto, how its been used, how it's been cracked and rebuilt over and over again.

If you do something against the user agreement, you only have yourself to blame. And besides, most exchanges and various bitcoin services have the same rule about gambling sites.

There likely will be some push to lift the cap in the far future, but doing that will probably severely impact the price. No miner will want to accept a block produced by another miner that includes a block reward higher than it's allowed to be, and so it's likely they will never change the code that prevents that from happening.

You're being downvoted, but you're super right. It's a thing that people have trouble understanding, and it's partly because bitcoin is so often compared to gold and physical cash some people do erroneously believe that bitcoin is "on" your phone or "on" a hardware wallet. Your bitcoins only exist on the blockchain, and the blockchain exists between all the nodes that agree on what the blockchain is.
I often tell people that the blockchain is what people expected the cloud to be, except it fucking works. You can trust the blockchain as long as people are greedy enough to secure it.

Number one recommendation: Try to explain without evangelizing. Be as pragmatic as possible in your presentation, and encourage people to do their own research before investing. Talk about the current problems that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are facing, and the possible solutions that are being pursued.

Well, if they have reason to start a dispute, they can simply lock you out of your Steam account. You might be able to download some games before being locked out, but many steam games can't be run without steam in the background,or they need steam for multiplayer to function.
They don't need confirms when they've already got you by the balls.

If you are learning to do this on your own, I strongly recommend starting with a very small amount, like $50 worth of bitcoin. Get accustomed to how private keys and the different services work, learn proper backup and security procedures, even try spending some if for no other reason than for the experience. Buy something off of OpenBazaar, or any traditional online store that accepts bitcoin. After that, then consider buying a hardware wallet and investing more.

If you are reading news written by someone else, you are being manipulated. Bias is inherent in all media. If you find yourself staying just in one particular camp, then everything you read will confirm the biases of that camp. That's the reason why and alternate subs like exist.
Just like how you can't just listen to only CNN or only FOX. Read a bit of everything, and employ critical thinking.
And for what it's worth, it was that was convinced that Wright was Satoshi, when was mostly skeptical.

Just to be clear, this is reffering to blockchain.info, correct?
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:04:07
You're not wrong, but bitcoin is not a private key. If you print out a private key 20 different times, you're not teleporting that bitcoin around. Bitcoin exists not in physical space, but on the blockchain. Just like nobody really *has* bitcoin on their phone or hardware wallet, they have the private key for that bitcoin which for all intents and purposes cannot be independently reproduced by anyone else.
Malleability in the bitcoin space refers to transaction malleability, which is a problem we're trying to solve with segwit. It's a little confusing to call bitcoin itself malleable when what you're really trying to say is that it can be made easily accessible.
