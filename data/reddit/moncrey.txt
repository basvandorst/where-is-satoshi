Poor guy... that is not at all reasonable
@_date: 2015-12-21 04:07:13
5000 is totally fair... at the very least its a bit rude to complain about it
@_date: 2014-09-04 21:01:56
Its actually got a great selection of non-class-textbook stuff. I shop there and i dont attend MIT
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:42:13
I was probably even drunker when i did that
and this hangover is longer lasting
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:34:30
good point.
I guess i just discovered the level of discontent i have with tax law
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:27:24
That is a great argument. I hope you're able to pull it off. Please post again when you have some news of progress!

5 months later, this is funny to read
@_date: 2014-04-30 17:04:37
was launched around new years day, got pumped and dumped pretty quick like anything else. Its down to 9 litoshi right now because of multipool. and insta-sell people. Others like myself see how awesome it is and are holding huge quantities and awaiting / developing ways to use it :)
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:42:49
I am teh smart
@_date: 2014-05-30 17:19:13
I'm that dumb motherfucker who bought 10btc at that price and sold at 220

Wishing i hadnt dumped my few thousands into BTC and then into DOGE.... but i still have hope (or lack of desire to lose so much value permanently)
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:10:12
This is the most terrifying commercial i have ever seen.
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:53:47
We have one of those in Boston... thats my guess
@_date: 2014-04-01 15:58:59
lol APRIL FOOLS!
@_date: 2014-03-07 05:14:04
im sure he'll come if you ask like that, op!
@_date: 2014-04-04 16:44:22
as a boston globe employee, I'll tell you this has a lot to do with more papers offering digital services. Also somehow they still make fuck-tons on the ads, both in print and on screen
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:19:24
Once you're in there, you'll find that everything is based on gift/barter. Despite the obscene cost of tickets, its really nice to know that you dont have to think about money for a week once you've arrived.
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:47:47
Just shows theres a lot of excited newbie traders in the room, like you and me
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:44:31
1 million mooncoin is currently worth about $1.30, so its not worth zero. That said, that few cents could be ten bucks in a month or so! You're welcome :)
@_date: 2014-04-16 15:20:00
Its pretty obvious difference, mutecow. renting a car results in dollars. mining results in magic internet money which is Property. Do you get taxed for digging holes for fossils in your own back yard?

I'm starting a free-music tip-based label called Cryptobeat because I believe that tipping will catch on and cryptocurrency is perfect for getting musicians paid.

This title makes me vomit.
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:16:17
thanks for imparting some knowledge on me. I'll have to do some more reading on this topic.
@_date: 2014-04-18 03:35:39
+123777 moon!
@_date: 2014-04-16 19:05:48
my. god. theres something really wrong with that!
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:17:10
yes i definitely did alright. but you know, shoulda coulda woulda. no regrets, just lessons learned
@_date: 2015-05-28 12:20:58
seriously, i cant believe how blindly judgmental all these commenters are. Vaporware? IBM doesnt fork vaporware.
@_date: 2014-05-31 00:04:30
I'm quite undecided right now as to whether it was a big mistake to transfer all my BTC into Doge. its dropped in value a ton. Of course, the community is strong and support for the currency is growing. Does this mean the value will go back up to what I bought it at? I have NO idea.
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:40:40
i like this image haha
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:14:18
what would the cost be for miners to break even?
@_date: 2015-01-15 04:39:40
that is my current full time job. I'm good at it, but you are right -- it can really be risky, especially in inclement weather.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:12:09
Yes, Absolutely!
@_date: 2014-07-16 22:46:17
finally! I've been waiting for google to do that!
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:48:36
Oh my god what the hell!! Who is making these decisions???
Really great time to replace the fine design with something horrible -- right when the price is plummeting /s
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:19:21
but can you download it after paying?
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:58:04
That said, the phone wallet is not easy, compared to some phone services. Square is easier. Paypal is easier. Bitcoin is not hard, but it sure doesnt look as useable. UX is important.
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:17:28
I'm so impressed by this community sometimes
@_date: 2015-07-13 10:48:07
im a supporter of bitcoin but you cant expect that the non-technically-inclined would adopt such a complicated currency. It is still way too difficult for most people to use, i think.
@_date: 2015-07-14 13:19:40
can it be downloaded if you pay? Not paying 6 bucks just to watch...
@_date: 2015-07-08 21:32:30
Thank God, I didn't want a reason to like uber
@_date: 2015-07-03 23:42:16
Unlike coinex.PW, I sent a large sum to them once and they gave no fucks about my mistake
@_date: 2015-07-03 12:55:39
Wow, watch those donations pour in!
@_date: 2015-04-25 05:16:51
yes, long enough for the price to drop 40 more bucks so i can buy some more
@_date: 2015-03-15 07:22:16
a good system is transparent... remember that...
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:47:00
its literally 2 cents dude
@_date: 2017-07-19 20:22:16
I suggest forming a more clearly worded question. Perhaps he doesnt have thoughts on it and you should educate him (and others).
@_date: 2015-10-19 19:21:31
But what if you die and you want to continue and you send bitcoin BUT THE BLOCK DOESNT GO THROUGH FOR 11 SECONDS???
@_date: 2017-07-19 22:41:56
You are being logically lazy. You're countering my point by not acknowledging I had one. Accusing me of spiritual sloth, lol... Dimwit
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:28:24
Any huge spike will inevitably make a large downward adjustment before balancing out. That and the looming coin-split may have something to do with it, psychologically
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:45:11
you, sir, are a genius
