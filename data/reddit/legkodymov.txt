I use this service for more than 10 years (from December 2005) and more than happy. I use bitcoin more than 5 years. Now I'm glad to see they complement each other.

Volumes are not fake. China has no financial regulation inside country. Lot's of people outside Chine come to this country, open banking accounts and do stock operations without significant fees or limitations.
I would say, China is completely free market for Bitcoin.

I disagree. We are going to launch cloud mining soon. For us, cloud mining is external financing. We are going to deploy 10MW worth of power in 2016-2017. If we would do the same using only our own funds, we barely deploy 2MW. And we agree to share part of our profit in exchange of investments.
But in general there is a lot of scam in this area. People should investigate first.

Actually Gref notice Bitcoin in negative context. He said that currencies such as Bitcoin should fail once or twice, before we get _regulated_ cryptocurrency. Also, he noticed that Bitcoin can't be prohibited, and we should take it as granted.
