I don’t think ledger is necessary using coinbase. They use cold storage and your coins are insured.

Coinbase Pro needs better trading tools. They are woefully inadequate.

Ya, I know, it’s like SIPC insurance. I get itZ

I use coinbase but they suck. Coinbase pro’s trading platform is so pathetic.

Wrong, your coins are insured. Look it up. Your cash is FDIC insured too.

The fact that BTC is up today while the market was down 3% is a very good thing. It’s turning into a safety haven which will increase its status and make more people comfortable investing in it.

Why are you giving inaccurate info? Coinbase insures your coin similar to SIPC insurance for stocks. If Coinbase gets hacked or loses your coins, you’re covered. I never said your coins were covered from your own computer getting hacked. Do some research before you spread disinformation. Do you work for CNN?
Coinbase maintains commercial criminal insurance in an aggregate amount that is greater than the value of digital currency we maintain in online storage. Our insurance policy is made available through a combination of third-party insurance underwriters and Coinbase, who is a co-insurer under the policy.
The policy insures against theft of digital currency that results from a security breach or hack, employee theft, or fraudulent transfer.

The fact I responded to his absurd reasoning says a lot because it’s absurd. Space mining and Millennials is the reason Gold is obsolete? It’s absurd and you’re an obvious retard for not acknowledging that.

Straw man how? Do you even know what that means?

I bought a ledger wallet like 2 years ago but never used it. I just keep my btc on Coinbase. Honestly though, I feel like my btc is pretty safe on Coinbase? I guess I’m just being lazy.

Armageddon is more likely than mining gold from Asteroids. Your views are riddled with fallacies but I don’t really care, your life is of no importance to me. Have a good one.
And you do realize that people under 30 tend to have evolving viewpoints as they get older? People are not static, just another fallacy your flimsy viewpoints are built on.
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:11:48
You’re just too dumb to understand. From the looks of your responses, you know nothing of economics, finance and equity markets.
@_date: 2019-09-06 21:38:00
Btc doesn’t need to replace gold and it never will. They can both coexist as an inflation and stock market hedge.

I think TA can work when the price consolidates and trades within a range.  You can definitely trade within that range and do ok if you know what you’re doing and can be disciplined.
What’s hard is using TA to determine a breakout, whether it’s to the upside or downside. If you are going to trade, only use a portion of your stack too.
@_date: 2019-09-07 00:26:00
Gold is still an excellent market hedge. Just in the last couple weeks gold has been up when the market has been down. Why are you even arguing about this?
A stupid post on reddit that you link doesn’t mean anything.
@_date: 2019-09-07 01:01:46
For Gold, it’s not about price performance. It’s about its ability to minimize drawdowns in falling equity markets. I’m a CFP and work in the industry, I know what I’m talking about. I own btc and absolutely believe in it but you’re naive if you think gold is going away. You keep talking about millennials... Gold is a GLOBAL commodity, it’s not only in the USA. 
You’re bringing up mining gold from asteroids,..do you know how far we are away from doing that, if at all? You’re talking about many decades if not longer, if ever.
Also, What happens if there is a global Armageddon? In that scenario, btc will be completely worthless. In that scenario, gold and guns will be all that matters. 
I’m not trying to be an ass but it sounds like you worship btc, almost like you’re part of a cult. Not a good idea to think that way, makes you irrational.
Also, I wasn’t cherry picking dates lol. I used a 40 year sample. That’s not cherry picking.

Gold, like bitcoin, is one piece of a diversified portfolio. Gold has excellent diversification characteristics. In rising equity markets, gold typically has low to no correlation to equities and in falling equity markets it typically has a negative correlation to equities. If you are investing in ONLY gold, then yes, it’s a bad long term investment but only a moron would ever do that.
Owning gold as an equity hedge works because when the market falls, gold is typically positive. Gold was positive in 2001, 2002 and even 2008, all years the stock market got crushed. Bitcoin will likely do the same going forward, although btc hasn’t existed during a recession in the United States so that hyposthesis hasn’t been tested yet.

 Bitcoin and gold can both coexist together. They both have acted similarly to equity markets this year...low to no correlation in up markets and low to negative correlation in down markets. That’s what we want.

Why would you trade your whole stack?Dont ever  trade more than 25% Of your stack max.
@_date: 2019-09-07 03:19:20
Well, humans have used it as money for thousands of years. Peer reviewed articles? Lol. What are you talking about. Gold has been used as $ and ornamental objects for thousands of years, all across the world and by cultures/civilizations that never interacted or overlapped. So yes, it obviously had a strong pull on humans and how we act towards it. Ever heard of Gold fever?

I think you need to go back and read his responses. Those were his 2 main reasons. He built his entire argument on it. But I don’t really care. I don’t worship btc like some of you people do. It’s like a cult to some of you.
@_date: 2019-09-06 22:57:04
Gold is not obsolete. That is preposterous.
@_date: 2019-09-06 23:39:01
Logical fallacy. Gold isn’t a weapon. It’s a store of value and has been for thousands of years. People will always want gold, it’s hardwired into our brain.

If you’re comfortable with the volatility and have other investments then go for it. If the $20k Roth is all you have, then I’d say no.
@_date: 2019-09-07 02:59:43
Actually I did. He kept saying Gold would lose value because of space mining and millennials. I gave responses to both of his objections. Reading is hard huh?

Who says anything about daytrading? Here’s a good stat, I used to be a financial Consultant at Schwab and we had a white paper(I can’t reference it now since I don’t know how to find it but this scenario is 100% legit.) the $ numbers and years may be off by a bit but I’m pretty close.
If in 1975, you invested $100 in the SP500 and held straight through to 2016 and reinvested dividends, you’d have around $8000(roughly).
If in 1975, you invested $50 in SP500 and $50 in Gold and held through 2016, you’d have around $9000(roughly). 
What’s even crazier is that with the 50/50 portfolio, not only would you have made more $ but that portfolio had a significantly lower standard deviation than the 100% SP500 portfolio. Gold works and all the empirical data supports that.
I’m not saying a portfolio should be 50% gold either. Max, it should be 10% and even that’s high. I’m just saying that owning gold in a diversified portfolio, over multiple market cycles, will smooth out volatility, minimize drawdowns and give you better risk adjusted returns. Ideally, you’d own gold and bitcoin in that diversified portfolio.
