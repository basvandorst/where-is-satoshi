Cold storage is an offline wallet. Keeping your crypto on an exchange is pretty much the polar opposite of cold storage. The idea is that your private key is entirely in your control and disconnected from the Internet so it is not possible for others to gain access to it.
When you put your crypto on a hardware wallet (like Nano Ledger S), that is putting your crypto into cold storage.

Just curious why you think it's idiotic

Not true. If your BTC (for example) has grown in value and you exchange it for LTC you are essentially selling BTC and buying LTC, and at that time you are realizing the gains on the BTC. That is taxable.

Get a hardware wallet like a Trezor or Nano Ledger S. Once you transfer your Bitcoin (or ETH or other supported altcoin) to your hardware wallet then the security of the wallet lands entirely with you. Don't give your PW/PIN to anyone and make sure you have the backup phrase (12 or 24 words), and protect that as well. Your backup phrase translates into your 256-bit private key, which is what it all comes down to. Whoever has access to the private key has access to the coin in the wallet.
I'm not sure exactly how NiceHash works but for anyone who mines using that service, as long as they consistently transferred their earnings to a hardware wallet (or actually any other wallet in this case) their Bitcoin would have been safe. What keeps happening is that people leave their currency on either an exchange's wallet, or a pooled service like NiceHash and they don't actually have control of a private key for their own wallet. Combined with the fact that these sites are highly desirable targets because they hold so much Bitcoin at once, and that's a recipe to lose all your shit if you are too lazy (or too cheap and trying to avoid transfer fees) to transfer your Bitcoin to a hardware wallet.
These hacks are super shitty and I feel bad for people who lose a lot of their money this way, but there are absolutely ways to avoid it and people have to start educating themselves.

You don't see that as a risk, and if you don't why don't you?

Right after I sent my comment about looking for "objective" advice, I realized that maybe wasn't the best word for it. It's not surprising to me that people on the Bitcoin subreddit are pro-Bitcoin and people on the Ethereum subreddit are pro-Ethereum, for the most part.
Just tired of all the political drama and was hoping this would be a bit of a logical bastion for people interested in the technology and making money.
Thanks for your perspective.

What does this have to do with anything?
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:41:38
But why does it need to be injected into the conversation here? No reason in particular besides continued whining about all things SJW.

I'm not so sure. In my (admittedly based mostly off anecdotal evidence) perspective, one of the most attractive aspects of Bitcoin to the general public is the decentralized aspect. It's definitely one of the most well-understood attributes of blockchain technology, and definitely a beloved aspect to libertarians.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:09:51
And totally, totally pointless, besides for virtue signalling other like-minded anti-PC folks like yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:06:02
Absolutely. I'm really looking forward to having more diversity among BTC users, not just for diversity's sake but because that will mean that it's being more widely accepted as having value.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:42:08
Of course, but the general public does not have as great of a desire for decentralized commerce as libertarians do.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:28:24
Haha, I am now. Was just replying to you. Cheers.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:29:49
Just curious, do you personally know of anyone else in your demographic who is invested in cryptocurrencies?
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:33:52
Haha, sound advice. I was just kind of surprised, even though I probably shouldn't be at this point. I'm pretty new to this subreddit so was trying to gauge if it was super political or what not, because I'm looking for objective info.

First, definitely not a stupid question. It's much better to get answers for your crypto questions before you start buying stuff.
mentioned cashflow, but that's not the real point of dollar-cost averaging (investing a set amount of $ at regular intervals rather than investing all of the $ at one time). Although you believe the price is going to rise, it's also going to drop at points. Many people try to predict these peaks and dips and you will hear a countless number of stories about these people losing a lot of money trying to do this, which is essentially day trading. Along with the high volatility of the market, there's not really good historical data to work off of because crypto is such a relatively new thing. Point being - do not day trade.
If you're investing a little bit of your money in intervals over time you average out your risk throughout the regular market dips and peaks. As a very simple example, if you bought $1,000 of BTC this week and the price ends up dropping next week, you lose value on your entire $1,000 investment. 
However, if you bought $500 of BTC this week, and then $500 next week, you will lose value on your original $500 investment, but then you'll be buying at a better price next week when you spend your other $500.
The downside is, of course, if the BTC price actually ended up rising after that first week then your investment with the $500 will grow less than if you invested $1,000 up front. But again, that's not something you should try to predict. So the point is to invest that set amount of $ each week and your gains and losses from market volatility will average out. By doing this investing in regular intervals, you are still banking on the price going up over time, but you won't lose your shirt by buying a ton of BTC at once right at a peak (remember: you won't know it's a peak until the price starts dropping again).
