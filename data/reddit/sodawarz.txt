There is an emerging market for them, thats why i asked, i have been approached to make some and sell them. They asked how much i would want and i dont know what is realistically fair, i asked once before but got a bunch of math problems as answers, so i want to know. WHAT WOULD YOU CHARGE if you were to sell them?

thousands of people have used the tool since 2010, and i am not the one buying them. thanks though.

I think thats a little steep, for what it would cost to replace my laptop in 14 days i think he would go out and buy more computers himself. beyond that, i highly doubt my 1 month old HP Envy would crap out after 2 weeks, its still under warranty for 5 years. i got ADH insurance as well (parents bought it for me) so if it died, i would just accidentally intentionally have someone knock it off the desk and let is break so it gets replaced.

No, its an indexing experiment. long drug out and hard to explain. the buyer is my computer science professor. In short its an experiment in bitcoin security. and to run his theory he estimates he will need about 270 TerraBytes of those files. Nothing malicious, not a scam, and i dont believe its open to the general public but if it takes a long while to generate that many files i am sure he will open it up to non students.
Anyways as you seem to be about the only one on this thread with a brain and isnt a total idiot (kiisfm). What do you think is a fair price? what would you charge per GB?

It can be run on a machine that is totally offline and never goes online, and is the only application on that machine. who needs trust. the safest computer programs in the world are the ones that run only on machines that NEVER have internet access.

Hey, now thats what i'm talking about. +1 for you good sir :)
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:40:19
and your still an idiot, and a very poor troll.

Your paranoid. nothing is illegal about using vanitygen.

Your an idiot. but thanks for playing

I want a little something out of the deal, but i know i am not going to get rich out of it. maybe if a few people come up with actual values like " i would ask .00001000 per GB myself if i were to do it" then i can divide that number in half and have him donate half to a charity. but since i cannot get any direct replies as of yet i have no basis to start.

Burn out my laptop? Sorry, i really have no idea how any of this works other than i type some code in a CMD window and it makes text files. When i run it my CPU is only running at about 20%. Do you think that is enough to burn it up over time? or is there something else i am missing that might hurt my laptop from it?
@_date: 2014-08-20 08:22:08
Not a bad idea, he said he would buy as many as i could make, my cost short of wear and tear on the laptop is $0, and i dont know how to calculate the wear on the laptop into a $ per GB figure. I dont pay for electricity so it would really be free for me unless my laptop died.

Sound advice, I didnt have to ask him why not his own, he has like 40 GPU's running 24/7 making those .txt files. 
I think i am going to go for somewhere around 1000 satoshi per GB. or .00001000BTC / GB. does that sound about right?

directory.io is very far from all of the private keys for bitcoin as that would take 10 to the 25th power yotta bytes of storage. but it is an accurate representation of how complicated it would be to generate them all. 
in response to your second point, he is not estimating anything, he has a theory, he wants to test it, it pertains to bitcoin security, i am sure he is aware of the mechanics and number of addresses.
I dont believe he is foolish in the slightest sense. He asked what we would want in terms of satoshi per GB of raw data, we have a week to come up with a number and get back to him, he will then tell us if its within budget. (we have no idea what the budget is or trust we would go for all of it)
I thought the best way for us to get an estimate on what to ask would be to ask the bitcoin community itself what they would charge. to give us a "i would charge .xxxxxxxx per GB answer" and for 3 days now 0 people have replied with anything but insanity and demonstrations of how infantile the minds of people who are part of the bitcoin community are with the exception of a short few who although logical and smart still do not reply with a .xxxxxxxx / gb answer.
i think i am going to just start a MFT of new threads each asking "would you generate vanitygen files for .00001000 /gb?" then another the same but for .00002000 and so on, sooner or later someone will reply with, hey i'll sell them to you for that, and although i made a mess of this subreddit and pissed a ton of people off, we will finally have an answer. If you cant beat them join them, i guess i will have to resort to an infantile method to get response from an infantile community.

Everything in bitcoin is a scam, or at least is accused of being a scam, by the next google index you will type scam into your search bar and bitcoin.org will be the first listing. you people are idiots. (the ones who run around screaming scam about anything )

Ah, thanks for making that make sense. I guess i have to take that into consideration. Seeing as i am getting very little feedback on what would be a good price in satoshi i am probably going to just end up shooting myself in the foot and picking a random number per GB and see if he goes for it, i was really hoping to get more response, but as you can see from Buttcoinhurt, it took 5 minutes to become trolled with 0 constructive input beyond your good advice.
