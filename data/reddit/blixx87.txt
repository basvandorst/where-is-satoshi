@_date: 2018-09-03 18:52:39
He must be getting ready to dump
@_date: 2018-09-17 18:12:19
Down, and I’m about to get raped with down votes because I’m not a “moon boy”
@_date: 2018-09-02 14:43:11
Get recked soon, I’ll be back here when it dumps hard ;)
@_date: 2018-09-03 18:54:19
Bear market is not over don’t listen to this kid lol 
@_date: 2018-09-03 21:19:06
@_date: 2018-09-18 02:33:30
Hahaha I remember when this was launching, everyone was like this is what will bring the bull market back, that worked out well
@_date: 2018-09-18 02:34:10
Are you stupid? Maybe the company who who’s DMM Bitcoin? 
Do you say the same when you see a McDonald’s billboard? “I WONDER WHO PAYS FOR THAT”
@_date: 2018-09-03 20:34:42
And then you prolly continued to pay cash or card 
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:27:12
Don’t sell when it goes to 4.2k now 
@_date: 2018-09-18 02:44:30
Being a keyboard warrior is fun tho :( 
@_date: 2018-09-02 00:06:00
Nahhh bruh we going to 3k, btw you notice the two emotional people who downvotes me? ��
@_date: 2018-09-03 19:23:50
No reason to get emotional Rubin, we are defiantly still in a bear market until we form a higher low
@_date: 2018-09-09 05:25:51
Or buy at 4.2k soon if $5800 is broken that’s the next support level 
@_date: 2018-08-18 23:40:35
So when exactly  7.4k?  Give me a time frame so I know when to come back and say told you so :)

It will be massive and meanwhile hop on the Litecoin August 2019 halving train and then jump into BTC after the LTC halving gains 
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:54:59
We won’t even break 7K before another big leg down. Mark my words

@_date: 2018-08-18 23:03:45
This post is ganna age well lmao
@_date: 2018-08-19 01:46:37
The article is quite stupid to be honest, but the halving is real regardless
@_date: 2019-03-11 07:01:05
That’s the bootleg pomp 
@_date: 2019-03-11 07:02:04

@_date: 2019-03-05 17:26:57
Oh I read used apps like coinbase lmao
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:04:44
Congrats, I got 1 full this month too. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 00:05:13
This is the kid that buys xrp because btc is too “expensive” lmao
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:18:50
No worries. I just went through the sign up process. It’s def a yes.
@_date: 2019-11-07 10:12:59
Bring on the down votes, boomers. Think y’all ganna be rich in 2 years ��
@_date: 2019-11-07 09:41:29
This is why I’m glad I’m not old. I have all the time in the world for bitcoin to grow and become legititment. It’s way to early to be thinking like you. It’s still very early and risky. 
You can’t guarantee bitcoin to cover your expenses when you retire.
I’m sorry but that’s the cold hard truth.
@_date: 2019-03-11 07:03:28
And let me guess, you went there just to screen shot this, and closed out. Or maybe you were actually ordering food and still used fiat?

@_date: 2019-11-02 13:42:59
Back then people bought bitcoin and held onto it if they understood the tech and saw the potential. Winkelvoss twins are a good example

Greedy ass. You see 100k and all you think is “maybe I can squeeze more”
@_date: 2019-11-10 10:40:20
Imagine being this blind
@_date: 2018-10-25 22:50:46
Bad idea, Tesla has already had financial issues, selling a car for bitcoin then bitcoin tanking the day after wouldn’t help them 
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:47:16
It’s ok we only dropped $400, why panic sell
@_date: 2019-11-23 20:38:20
When bitcoin hits 100k just self half it’s ganna bottom out at like 20k and buy back the other half and keep the difference
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:48:05
Say the word bitcoin in Dave Ramsey financial independence group and you will get slaughtered ��

By the time I’m 50 I won’t even have to sell my bitcoin
@_date: 2019-11-07 09:39:25

@_date: 2018-10-09 00:54:04

@_date: 2019-11-08 10:44:26

Ok, buys car for 15 bitcoins, bitcoin tanks 50% next day, dealership goes bankrupt 
@_date: 2019-11-19 03:48:42
Your delusional to think the market will give you a second chance. Many people are in the same boat as you that got REKT and didint buy at 3K. 
There for majority want to buy that low. Won’t happen
P.S I  did :)
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:43:34
I remember those days when bitcoin was at 9.2K feels like two years ago. It already had a huge dump to 9K
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:26:13
@_date: 2019-11-04 03:10:11
I mean it’s just $200 what can go wrong?
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:55:39
That’s what ur emotions say 
@_date: 2019-11-08 20:39:01
If they all just allocated 5% of their portfolio into bitcoin when I was in there talking about btc, (price was 4.3k) they would be closer to financial independence. 
P.S I got blocked and kicked from the group lol
@_date: 2019-11-10 10:09:36
So bitcoin the fork is backed by BSV?
@_date: 2019-03-19 03:19:18
They have bitcoin logo emojis for cash app card? Bruhhhh I missed out lmao
@_date: 2019-03-19 03:19:59
It’s fiat only card. Buying bitcoin is a separate  feature in app only 
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:40:20
Thanks, but yet I’m more successful then they have ever been, they told me to go to school and get a “real job” 
@_date: 2018-10-30 18:01:34
So many dumb answers here. 
You guys are paying the credit card fees not the merchant. EVERYTHING is factored into the price of merchandise. Every business does this, including mine. 
My customers are paying the CC fees.
You all are blind lol
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:57:01
Yeah man, hopefully living like shit will pay off I hold a decent amount of crypto 
@_date: 2018-10-25 22:54:12
So Tesla should risk going bankrupt so they can pump your bags? 
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:20:55
Abra has a promotion right now, if you do 100k worth of trading u get rewarded 2.5k 
@_date: 2019-11-11 00:32:59
More like 4 halvings away. Bring on the down votes ��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:51:20
Thank u I’m anally humble
@_date: 2018-10-21 08:27:17
@_date: 2018-10-14 04:36:28
Funny to think, if I put the dip at 20k instead I would be getting thousands of up votes but the moon boys are raping the down vote 
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:21:31
Don’t keep money in ur bank u can’t afford to loose �� buy BTC OTC or at an ATM
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:18:36
Just scrolled through reddit, you have some more work to do buddy so much misspelling everywhere! 
@_date: 2018-10-29 18:04:51
I fell if my chair in fear seeing this 
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:29:10
Or buy and sell items locally turn a profit and use that to buy bitcoin like I do. My business is reselling 
@_date: 2018-10-21 17:46:42
Yes we’re idiots! 
@_date: 2018-10-09 01:20:15
Well you sure did buy at a bad time just saying haha charts point down 
@_date: 2019-11-04 03:49:19
Sat me up
@_date: 2018-10-08 00:29:59
Look at that though, I gave advice here that has made me thousands of dollars and I get downvoted lol 
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:23:15
Nothing it’s just a legit exchange haha 
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:42:43
I don’t see a disclaimer about “not financial advice”
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:38:50
I think I’m doing fine, I’m not the one spending my time correcting people on reddit after being depressed and miserable from loosing money in crypto ��
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:19:58
Just how I like my BBCs
@_date: 2018-10-09 11:05:17
Always that one smart ass in here ^ 
@_date: 2018-10-07 04:43:15
Damn I got wrecked by down votes 
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:12:49
You realize, it’s ganna take like 50 years before we get to that point lol
@_date: 2018-10-21 08:28:28
Same shit people told me when I said bitconnect was a scam, try again 
@_date: 2018-10-30 17:57:37
This, the world is so brain washed and don’t even know this. I run a business and factor in credit card fees to my merchandise.
My customers are paying for the CC fees not me, they just don’t know. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 22:56:10
He would start a debate saying that crypto is now sensorshipping him and that all exchanges are going against decentralization ��
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:58:26
I assumed you meant up, but I think down 
@_date: 2018-10-14 01:56:11
It’s about to be broke tho when the dorito goes to the cheese dip
@_date: 2018-10-07 20:45:20
Get a life lol, also if you think I’m trolling. No, you can make more money flipping something off Craigslist or by working a job then buying bitcoin your self 
@_date: 2019-11-15 13:55:49
Lol. It’s simple, everything that claims to be the next bitcoin is a scam
@_date: 2018-10-18 09:44:36
Wrap the ledger like a gift with the paper wallet 
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:44:54
Butt hurt meter has increased ^
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:10:44
On reddit? I  wil keep misspellin just so u get trigg3rd moar 
@_date: 2019-11-05 19:11:44
One more question... when trading ur crypto for another directly in the wallet, is it doing it on a exchange behind the scenes?
So technically it’s all recorded and your 1099 will show you sold a crypto? Aka it creates a tax implication?
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:13:48
butt hurt meter x1000 ^
@_date: 2019-11-07 13:28:29
I knew someone was going to say this, but the odds are still in a young guys favor then a old boomer
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:00:31
Stock market officially in bearish territory? 
@_date: 2018-10-21 17:19:23
When idiots like me are buying bitcoin and litecoin today, they should add that in! 
@_date: 2018-10-28 21:56:40
For those curios I’m 23 
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:03:21
Yeah I think I should sell soon , I bought a big bag in this last big dip, already up on my profit 
@_date: 2018-10-28 19:19:44
Bet you already got ur dms filled with scammers 
@_date: 2018-10-22 02:01:51
You realize I’m being sarcastic and that this article above is also sarcastic? People are so slow lol 
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:58:32
Is the membership free
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:30:27
Glad I didint sell. ����
@_date: 2018-10-19 17:21:47
And diydude that’s all speculation but I hope it’s true. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:21:51
Yeah u don’t know what Gemini is? It’s winklevoss  twins exchange 
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:05:44
Yea ganna be selling Tuesday or Wednesday. I converted my BTC to LTC just in case LTC sees a pump with the Gemini listing 
@_date: 2019-03-03 02:58:27
BTC Reddit is taken over by Bcash fan boys lol
@_date: 2018-10-30 19:45:31
PayPal is not reversible if he sends via friends and family, that’s the only way I would ever do it. I have sold crypto like This to people, I’d be willing to sell you some if you don’t find anyone else. I do take a commission 
@_date: 2018-10-14 20:02:47
Sounds like ur getting emotional
@_date: 2019-11-26 20:14:37
That was a stupid financial decision to begin with, buying a new car when you don’t need a new one that is.  
Buying bitcoin was defiantly smarter, and id make your “two year” timeline to more like 10 years.
@_date: 2018-10-14 00:20:04
And in a month or so when we break 6k and go to 3k people like you will be saying “crypto is dead it’s a scam”
@_date: 2018-10-14 02:10:08
Well I’m just going off the exchange listing to Gemini, ZCash went up 60% when it got added, maybe 10% with LTC if we get lucky. And then I’m out until the Dorito touches the cheese 
@_date: 2018-10-24 21:02:13
The blockchain space is still so new there’s no such thing as crypto experts yet.. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 23:07:02
You must be fun at party’s 
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:25:42
You do the exact opposite when selling, so yeah when you are ready to panic sell, you are good to go
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:06:37
I got bitcoin article as the first thing, did incognito and a vpn
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:35:58
U clearly invested more then you can afford to loose. Ur fault
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:03:06
If most of your money is in Bitcoin then by all means, I only use it to store value and as a savings. I never saved money before I got into Bitcoin. Now I have more then my parents ever had in their savings. That’s my use case.
I have fiat to spend, it’s more convenient and way easier at the moment.
@_date: 2019-10-22 12:41:53
Here: [Anyone use **Bitcoin** as a **savings account**?](
People have been doing this since 2016, (on Reddit). 
Using it as a savings is not stupid. 
  
Also savings is not considered cashing out on tops. You just HODL.
@_date: 2019-10-04 12:21:47
You don’t understand. For fractions you are paying way less then CB. If you wanna make big purchases stick with exchanges.
For us who stack sats the pennies don’t mean shit
@_date: 2019-10-10 04:56:57
That’s just a QR code... it was not invented by Bitcoin devs lol
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:36:46
He bought the lambo dreams ����
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:23:29
Everyone who lost money is ganna come here and just troll you then rather try it. 1 Year is too far out for these kids to see results. They want it today lol.
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:10:54
I’m shocked only one person realized this. So many uneducated noobs here lol. Even the tweet says after.
@_date: 2019-10-07 17:07:34
Yeah, it’s not like Bitcoin is up 150% this year ;)
@_date: 2019-10-20 09:25:57
He bought the lambo dreams ����
@_date: 2019-10-11 18:50:37
Personally fiat is still more easy to spend for me. I use bitcoin as a store of value and savings. I love selling fiat for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-20 12:37:48
Yeah you have good intentions. If they are so upset with crypto. They should go into traditional markets and try out this strategy.
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:24:45
Usually when I buy $10 I have $9.97, the 3 cents don’t mean anything to me I love the convenience.
@_date: 2019-10-07 12:42:00
Old men can’t think forward. Times have changed :) Although I agree, It’s stupid to spend Bitcoin today. 
But one day it won’t be volatile anymore and we can start doing both. 
Old men
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:00:50
You ever think for a second that the media could be over exaggerating things to get more clicks? 
I’m worried how easily you probably fall for crypto fud. Lol
@_date: 2019-08-02 00:10:57
Should show XRP getting rear ended by the banks
@_date: 2019-10-07 13:39:47
Holding a non correlated asset to store wealth has been normal business since the inception of gold
@_date: 2019-10-28 00:50:03
I do. I never saved money before I got into Bitcoin, now I buy weekly. I’m in profit and have more savings then my parents ever had in their life’s
@_date: 2019-02-16 07:15:43
JPM coin is not blockchain or crypto. Jesus. Bear market has a long way to go before we weed out the noobs 
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:17:01
Nope cash app is cheapest option to buy bitcoin instantly on an app.
@_date: 2019-02-06 03:54:51
What’s up with his tweet date 6.2.19?
@_date: 2019-10-26 08:44:18
It was never boring you noobs lol.
@_date: 2019-02-16 08:33:34
Honestly I don’t think so, there using the word blockchain already, there pretty much misleading lol, I won’t be surprised there ganna call it a crypto.
It’s what ever tho,  Jamie Dimon is a POS 
@_date: 2019-02-17 22:38:15
Me. If you can hack it, keep. If u can’t pay me 5 bitcoins 
@_date: 2019-02-21 04:12:28
That’s true, ONLY LN at the moment it’s just how they made it for choice I guess
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:57:15
Even when you send bitcoin to an exchange then out, how do you know your getting back the exact same bitcoin you deposited in the first place? 
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:27:28
@_date: 2019-02-19 04:23:03
But they said “final capitulation” ����
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:10:02
Dude thanks for the info and the sats again. This is sick! I’m ganna be passing on those satoshis 
@_date: 2019-10-20 20:10:15
It clearly says after the halving... if you look at the charts bitcoin pumps after the havings. The pump is spread out into 2 years. 
Moon boy.
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:00:54
The issue is their system. I’ve had a ledger for 3 and a half years every update is a headache. And majority of ledger owners know this.
It just works when it feels like it, I use it as a burner now and my Trezor causes no issues
@_date: 2019-02-21 03:14:10
Invoice me for 10 sats 
@_date: 2019-02-14 06:58:17

I can see this giving you cancer for eating lol
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:26:10
Oh yeah IK. I was just wondering if that’s what people were currently doing. I think it’s important for adoption to make things as easiest as possible 
@_date: 2019-02-16 00:22:13
No send me money via friends and family, so you can’t backcharge it, and so I can scam a scammer and run away with ur money. I’ll donate it to a charity actually.

Ay thanks haha I was just trying to find my redddit acc actually lol, I can’t copy the damn address the bot sends me on iOS it’s so dumb 
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:07:30
I totally get what you mean, we’re now in a different digital era with crypto, realistically there is no need for processors, it can be all P2P.
And anyone can still use what ever currency they want. It’s happening today

I have blue wallet and wallet of satoshi  I got both to send my self back and forth ���� it’s so cool. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 08:24:07
Where’s the crypto graphy? It’s literally just a digital centralized database. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:23:09
Will you be able to send LN payments by selecting .15 BTC from wallet, like normal? Or even selecting it in dollar value,
Send $800 of bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:42:59
Ooo fat. Imma pass on. I tipped pomp and jack today on twitter ��
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:23:17
LTC has been also out performing bitcoin recently too very interesting, might have to do with up coming halving 
@_date: 2019-02-26 19:25:57
No we can all make our own just as easy as you did and pay cost price lol. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 23:29:01
Send me it first 
@_date: 2019-02-03 15:26:31
Visa, MasterCard, discovery, amex, Venmo, PayPal, Xoom.
Only close minded BTC maximalists feed this narrative of only one “coin” 
While I believe BTC will be the most dominant in the near future as it’s one of the most secure networks Personally I think coins like LTC as well which is also one of the second secure networks, also getting LN network and will be able to on chain swap BTC to LTC instantly 
@_date: 2019-10-28 07:13:17
Good luck, when ever a ledger update comes out it’s a headache to update. Sometimes take 2 hours until you make it work.
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:17:03
So will LN always use the word Sats? Instead of BTC? 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:20:05
Oh that’s cool. I understand now, yeah i wouldn’t be able to do it, I would probably need a casanode I heard those are easy for a $300 price tag ��.
And as far as I’m concerned anyone can connect to anyone’s node 
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:03:55

@_date: 2019-02-13 18:20:29

Satoshi is a smart man. Since he doesn’t exist bitcoin has no central point of failure 
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:00:17
Obviously, my point was in decentralized world anyone can use what ever they want. Telling everyone to use bitcoin only is kinda centralized way of thinking

@_date: 2019-02-20 06:33:27
Did you know for every crypto purchase individually has to be held 1 year to pay less taxes? So if you buy .15 BTC to add to ur .50 stash u been holding for a year, you gotta hold the .15 for another year to pay less taxes on that.

Casanode was a huge milestone. All new tech is expensive at first, soon it will be all software like you said on our phones. Crazy stuff. 
And yeah I use that website to check BTC and LTC LN capacity’s. Damn, I wanna contribute but I can’t all good lmao

He used his genius skills and made money 
@_date: 2019-02-14 06:45:56
Yo this is the second time somone tipped me satoshis on here. Lol how do I even claim it ��
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:05:26
Actually just did it. Wow. First time trying LN network.. that was so fast
@_date: 2019-02-16 22:07:29
Satoshi doesn’t need your money. He holds more BTC then all of us. Also some people actually care about taking down currupt bankers and trying to bring back power to the people then just making money  
@_date: 2019-02-20 06:54:34
That’s why crypto tax is confusing, even the US gov knows that

I never got the tip btw 
@_date: 2019-02-03 16:19:16
I don’t think so tbh. It’s huge news yes, but what’s happening now isn’t out of the ordinary when a halving is approaching 
@_date: 2019-02-14 07:16:56
Thnx man, btw as far as I was concerned you need a LN node to transact, who’s node are we using here? 
@_date: 2019-02-04 10:37:33
Go ahead and spend ur bitcoin, I’ll be buying it back up. It’s to scarce for me to let go of it, I’ll rather spend Litecoin

There’s no alternative to crypto, it’s a matter of time until people realize bitcoin isn’t about having a faster and cheaper way to pay, but to take control of your own money ��
Congrats you just made your self look like an idiot, not knowing the only thing bitcoin has against fiat ��
@_date: 2019-01-10 18:10:37
Isn’t this good for bitcoin? As they held a lot of the mining power

@_date: 2019-01-17 09:54:29
Exactly Ganjin haha
@_date: 2019-01-03 09:29:04
My answer would be if Bitcoin got messed up, there’s always Litecoin right besides it, that’s why Litecoin is here to co exist with bitcoin, it’s bitcoins little brother.
BTC has a uptime of 98.9% 
LTC has a uptime of 100%
@_date: 2019-01-10 22:34:56
Well we atleast sure as hell fished out bitmain so that’s good

Just to be clear as well not laughing that you lost money, I don’t wish it on anyone. But a tech isn’t dead or not going anywhere because you bought at the wrong time ��‍♀️

If I had sats for everytime somone used “the I’ve been here since “Insert year here” comeback to settle things down I’d be a millionare
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:48:31
Y’all are idiots. Institutions don’t fomo in like retail investors over hype. Keep thinking that and one day you will get so bored you will sell and give up like dumb money. Most of you will end up selling before we hit new ATH. I really hope we dump to 5K now so we can fish out the dumb money
@_date: 2019-09-26 17:38:02
Why? You zoomed out for me!
@_date: 2019-09-07 11:26:42
You gotta be delusional to think he has nothing to do with Libra. He invested it. Mark is the face of the brand.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:57:45
Detached from price but talking about hitting ATH 6 days ago, bro I know dumb money when I see it.
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:28:49
Sweet. I’m ganna actually down vote you too now so I feel better about my self.
@_date: 2019-09-24 01:58:15
Of course. I just think all the ones who are calling bakkt a failure need to get flushed out for my own satisfaction. I can’t believe how popular is it to say bakkt failed right now ����‍♀️����‍♀️
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:23:59
Stolen pic from someone else. Who comes on Reddit to hire people? Lol. This guys shady and probably has intentions to scam you.
@_date: 2019-09-21 09:07:50
They mentioned bitcoin in the show too. Haha the entire time the show reminded me of why crypto was made
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:04:56
Mostly bots.
It’s been proven.
If you make a poll asking favorite foods and make the poll consist off
1. pizza
2. Spaghetti
3. XRP
4. burgers
XRP will win the votes lmao
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:45:25
Recheck ur facts, max is 10K outside the USA.
Also, like I said above, wiring money takes days and cost huge fees, and nothing’s stopping anyone from holding ur money for “suspicion reasons” 
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:05:40
I’ll take some :)) merry Christmas my friend 
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:32:38
I understand your savings doesn’t even have that much in it but yes I do. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 18:29:51
You can already trade btc for LTC 
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:41:53
It may seem like that when you lost a lot of money and are loosing hope
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:58:40
Not mine ;) 
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:05:26
At this rate tether is ganna be  in the next 10 years 
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:51:05
This reminds me of the early debates of using letters over email, discounting a tech not even close to adoption yet lmao
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:46:44
But it’s what ever have fun with your life, I’ll go back to mine and see you in 10 years when btc is destroying the current financial system 
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:05:49
You must be fun at party’s 
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:08:38

@_date: 2018-12-12 18:16:56
He watched his favorite youtuber and just copied his TA lol
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:02:35
If you buy more you can make more money. 
I can afford to buy a lot because of my butt plug business. I sell butt plugs on ebay and amazon. Find your niche and get going 
@_date: 2018-12-12 05:31:39
Your world must only consist of selling at these levels, I’m sure you don’t even know what accumulation means
@_date: 2018-12-05 07:59:13
It’s ganna be running on Tesla battery’s? 
@_date: 2018-12-23 14:24:46
You Jew, just get a Nano, they are 30% off for the holidays, or simply just send me all ur bitcoin before you loose it
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:56:39

@_date: 2018-12-26 20:57:27
I know this is a troll but bro, you can fly to Amsterdam and go to red light district and just hire a prostitute for like $50 Euros all legal as well
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:05:41
If you bought at peaks and are selling at these levels and leaving the market 
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:18:16
Saved $10 even with ledger discounting 30% off thru the holidays? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-27 02:01:30
There’s no central point of failure to do so. U cum guzzling depressed troll, stop listening to Craig Wright 
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:21:59
What I was just there 2 days ago I didint see that 
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:07:27
Yes, and he’s ganna get his average down to $4k soon... then 3k... it’s the way to go!
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:47:25
I buy from coinbase weekly, the most I ever had to wait is 4 days.
@_date: 2018-12-24 15:55:38
Is this supposed to be funny? 
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:13:29
Huh? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:43:03
So I can buy btc and pay no fees and withdraw instantly ? ����
@_date: 2018-12-28 02:55:05
Next 5-10 years, you will probably give up before it does
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:21:35
You depressed trolls don’t know shit, this isn’t shit I read up on the internet , I do wire transfers regularly for my business and been limited 10k cash on a plane.
If I can count all the fees I paid over pst few years I could feed an entire city of homeless people with it 
The fact that you said wire transfers take minutes tells me you don’t know shit lmao 
@_date: 2018-12-01 14:52:10
Best performing asset class in the last 10 years is btc ;)
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:48:29
You can withdraw instantly from coinbase if you find your account with USD before you buy
@_date: 2018-12-12 06:39:24
Beware to all around you, to stay away from an idiot like you who keeps their crypto online 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:00:12
16? Takes 7 days max for me lol
@_date: 2018-12-24 21:54:02
So my funds are safu?
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:12:15
And this is when everyone comes in and just says the crypto’s their holding in their bags 
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:35:02
Rekt in the bum bum hole
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:30:35
It matters if you have a long term view, and not a get rich quick mind set ;) 
@_date: 2019-05-19 17:39:24
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:16:46
Oh nice so you saw crypto Kirby’s videos and just copied him?
@_date: 2018-12-09 02:12:47
Maybe to help you not panic sell?
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:20:47
Like? 
@_date: 2018-12-26 21:35:58
Ur post is as low as it can get already lol,  everyone hires prostitutes to fuck for fun, but every ordinary person can get a girlfriend, which you can’t. So your post is low as fuck
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:40:40
So ur a stock market moon boy? ��
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:01:51
I’ll call anyone buying all the way down from 7k a smart ass, because in the next 10 years this bear market ganna look like a blip in the charts 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:12:37
When I didint see the scissor doors go up I knew something was wrong 
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:22:07
I watched the entire documentary that was really good thanks for sharing
@_date: 2018-12-15 04:05:35
But if you listened to tone vays since January you would not be mad at him at all
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:49:28
You are not a wise person, we’re talking about moon boys lol. Adoption will take years. :)
People were scared of the internet, people were scared of cell phones. Seen it all. : 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:02:03
Like what? I bought my first bitcoin in 2014, printed the transaction and put it on my wall ��
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:46:42
This is good for crypto, a lot of people will be phased out, just like every year, even the “real hodlers” get forced to sell. I been here since 2013 and see this every cycle. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:03:09
To add some context my friend has been buying since 10k, his average is now $5200. Can you really complain? No. And he’s still buying today 
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:47:21
How fast?
@_date: 2018-12-01 18:35:40
Not everyone can be believers either, just don’t invest 
@_date: 2018-12-03 05:13:12
I’ve been here through a couple bear cycles :)
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:39:19
Fee less my ass, they give you a higher exchange rate, that’s basically paying a fee my dude, you got my excited I signed up and downloaded the app, and gave them all my information.. thanks for wasting my time lol
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:32:44
We’re at euphoria IMO. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 08:12:05
Not saying this is the turn around, but a bear market always ended when people were still calling “bull trap” just saying 
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:37:41
Why do idiots have this much money, parents rich? 
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:04:34
It won’t be launched until people like you sell and give up on the market 
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:57:10
Bitcoin is here to get people out of your money and that’s what I basically described, and some how you don’t agree with me that sending bitcoin is way easier, but you think it’s excellent tech are you just a sub Reddit troll lol
@_date: 2018-12-30 23:19:59
Wait till Chinese New Years 
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:15:24
Transfer btc to coinbase, withdraw btc from coinbase to PayPal with their new feature go on ebay and pay with PayPal �� my closest answer 
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:11:11
Notice how I said “if you are leaving the market” not making educated plans and countering the market 
@_date: 2018-12-27 01:25:33
I trust bankers way more then holding btc then having it dump and wipe my value
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:12:22
Could be or just between 3-4K for the next year or so, to bore people out. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:13:36
Transferring money obviously refers to that 
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:19:13
Also, report the seller. That’s been resealed. I’ve bought 3 directly from ledger. They look nothing like that. Think of opening a brand new iPhone, it’s shrink wrap is seemless. Ledgers is done the same way. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:38:39
I buy drugs with USD personally, just like most of the world does right now ;)
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:38:52
I’m dead LOL
@_date: 2018-12-10 11:21:13
My butt cheeks remained clenched too
@_date: 2018-12-12 18:15:48
Or.. use one of those crypto gift card websites and buy a ebay gift card with btc 
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:26:34
Imma put my portable iMac thingy and a hard dive  drive next to it and act like I’m doing the same thing 
@_date: 2018-12-02 17:35:18
Oh man that made me nut
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:37:56
You think people with that money buy on exchanges? Umm... 
@_date: 2018-12-03 04:09:33
So the noobs? Of course :)
@_date: 2018-12-28 06:23:00
I’m looking for moon and lambo functions. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:47:01
Yeah it’s like OTC kinda ur buying directly from a seller, but they charge at a higher price 
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:50:13
Or just simply send bitcoin transaction �� no questions asked 
@_date: 2018-12-29 05:20:36
Yes, international fees are killer, and sending a large amount to somone you will be making massive fees and wait days, and they have to be done before you leave the country physically in a branch 
Example: sending a 100M will cost you 30K in fees 
@_date: 2018-12-29 04:34:51
Transferring money from country to country, right now you can only carry 10k cash on planes, but they will also ask you a bunch of questions. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:56:24
Are you trolling? Lol. Your an idiot and I think I’m done talking to you bye
@_date: 2018-12-03 16:03:23
Far from it I only have profits in the market from btc I bought in 2014, you are the depressed troll who lost money :)  
@_date: 2018-12-27 15:59:58
Imagine going to college getting a degree and then applying at a job to use ur degree and they go, “sorry you have only been on Reddit for 3 months” 
@_date: 2018-12-08 21:51:05
Nope bank account, if you use debit, you pay a higher fee and can transfer instantly 
@_date: 2018-12-10 22:57:33
Lmao, that’s like saying, here’s my PayPal email. Get the money.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:50:20
Next bull cycle will be the institutional bubble, last year we saw the ICO bubble.
I know I got my bags ready in the best performing asset class in the last 10 years ����
@_date: 2018-12-15 01:05:43
LTC is a bitcoin fork tho :) 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:59:08
I’m sold
@_date: 2018-12-27 04:56:03
Hardware wallets can’t get hacked, my comment was to bait for the idiots ����
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:05:05
I’ve noticed the people that complain about fees are always the ones who don’t even have a $500 initial investment portfolio lmao. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 01:48:48
Wow now that’s a deal
@_date: 2018-12-26 20:59:49
Amsterdam’s hookers are regulated, they are tested all the time for aids. It’s a real business in Amsterdam lol. That’s why I’m telling you to go there 
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:19:34
No ones ganna buy this useless domain because USD is ganna be worthless in the coming years ��
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:06:27
These posts show the desperation of the need to make money in this market lol, lost a lot this year? Had to give out ramen noodles as Christmas presents this year? Sorry, this bear market will end when people like you forget about the last bull market. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:17:59
It was 8 hours, I think people can not shop for 8 hours and get on with their life lmao. Dumbest comparison.
I’m all for bitcoin and decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 18:28:40
So basically your saying you lost a lot of money and are depressed? 
@_date: 2018-12-27 16:11:58
Depressed troll, it was an analogy defining, being on Reddit for 3 months no where says how long you been in this space, how was that not obvious ����
@_date: 2018-12-13 17:24:47
I’ll give you some credit tho.. they do let you withdraw instantly 
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:45:39
I’ve heard people on Reddit use them being ceos of company’s as an excuse to their argument, I believe you are full of shit just like them lol, I litteraly sent a wire to a client Friday, it will be there by Monday lol
@_date: 2018-12-25 18:30:20
Thanks I don’t even know how to access it ��
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:26:09
But if you sold when he did, you wouldn’t be depressed and miserable as you are now, seems like you are just going through self doubt 
@_date: 2018-12-10 03:03:16
Yeah you fucking idiot, an aventador and a merci does, a hurcan or gallardo does not. I know my lambos ;)
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:02:23
I’d assume for a fee? So then it’s just like coinbase again 
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:58:16
There already adopting it, but I see them being obsolete In the next 50 years
