This has been the best way to go about it. If someone is actually interested in doing this then I tell them to setup a bittrex/binance account and I send them $50 in whatever my short term alts are along with the sell targets for them. And we setup their blockfolio account. This teaches them that one day they'll be up 15% and another they'll be down 40%. But a week later they're up 200%. We practice placing orders and stop losses. 
I show them charts so they can understand the basics of TA (flags, wedges, all that shit). I show them a calendar site so they can see what news is coming down the way for what coin. I show them how to use explorers. I tell them that when bitcoin pumps weak alts bleed out. Show them how to set alarms. I show them my top 5 favorite youtube crypto channels. Who to follow on twitter and telegram.
It's kinda fun to see them research and find their own coins and make their own moves. It gives them an appreciation for how this thing works and what it takes.
Some people offer to give me their money and ask me to trade it for them, but that kinda sucks the fun out of this. I don't want to be responsible for someone elses money. Can't effectively trade under stress like that. Need to be comfy during dips. If I had to cut losses every time a price dropped 10% then their holdings would dwindle down to nothing.

I've been talking my friends heads off about crypto for over 6 years now. They all say the same thing "Wow, it's gone up so much, can you tell me when it drops so I can get in?" Then it drops "I don't have any money." or "I think it'll drop more." None of them ever buy. Ever. They just tell me a bout how they're going to buy later or want to. But nobody ever does. 
So basically, don't talk to anybody about crypto outside of the internet.

It's funny when your friend who is an absolute noob hodls a coin that you think is trash and it outperforms you for the week.

Really tired of people saying shit like this. Guys, bitcoin went absolutely parabolic and is considered the most saturated market right now. We've hit an obscene ATH of $20,000 in a very very short amount of time. Why are you so scared?

Have you tried running the wallet in command line and using   
-salvagewallet ?

Peter Schiff has been shitting on bitcoin since 2011.

You're asking a stranger to give another stranger 10-20 THOUSAND dollars as if you're asking for a stick of gum.

You also compare wallets and talk about your personal experience with them. Also talk about how you technically don't own bitcoins, but the keys to a ledger or whatever. AKA answering like a cunt.

Humor me. If you don't care about money, then why do you own  or hold bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:43:31
If you want bitcoin to be a safe storage of value and can't stomach volatility then you haven't been paying attention at all and know nothing about bitcoin.

What would the difference be? Or do you let one depreciate without question? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 02:29:23
Not at the same time. And not for a very long time.

We never hit $5000. Again, full of shit.

How is this a problem? Bitcoin isn't yours. It's not subject to your ideology. If you don't care about the price, then don't worry about a crash. A crash is just an opportunity for fresh investors. Have you learned absolutely nothing about bitcoin's price history? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:28:20
So why did you sell at $5,000? I thought price didn't matter? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:04:12
This is by far and hands down the dumbest question I have ever seen in regards to not only bitcoin, but possibly any subject ever. All of us are here for the money. Anyone who says otherwise is absolutely full of shit. "I bought in at ten cents a coin, now bitcoin is $5000. I don't care about the price." Massive load of bullshit. Maybe you can stomach volatility better because of your position, but if bitcoin's price hit $10 a coin you personally would absolutely have questions and discussion about it.
If your smart ass retort to that scenario was "If bitcoin was $10 a coin I'd buy up as much as I could!" Then that just proves that price DOES matter.

I would bet my entire stack of bitcoin that you own bitcoin. Only thing is you're a cunt and would never give a straight answer, so why bother? 
 for many, is about personal sovereignty (bullshit), interesting technology (bullshit), and sound money (exactly).
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:22:18
It literally took me 5 second to prove that you're full of shit.
