which PR firm you are with?
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:41:30
Accept bitcoins on your site and bitcoiners will magically place orders! Amazing!
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:52:15
for short term investment, any sign of panic selling is usually bad ...
@_date: 2013-12-01 16:35:28
i wonder if we ever had a day this question was not asked...
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:53:58
as i see it, we are seeing either one of the two outcomes. a slight correction. or a HUGE correction.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:35:36
i actually don't mind seeing a day when arbitrage isn't possible anymore, for several reasons.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:49:00
it was a good run while it lasted
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:59:18
well, one thing i learned from last bubble, any first sign of panic selling, is when you SELL! immediately!
@_date: 2013-11-27 00:57:30
nah, people will just think you are crazy
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:51:27
appreciate the comment. i also don't understand some of the tone here sometimes, i guess part of it was my fault really... for being on reddit.
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:03:03
look here: 
@_date: 2013-04-04 18:45:37
working fine over here

Here take a look at the step by step review I did on how I got started on buying bitcoins:
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:12:45
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:57:08
i like where you are going with it
@_date: 2013-04-06 02:55:22
the thing about bitcoin is that, it hasn't even begun, what you see now is nothing compared to what you will see a few years from now. we will see bitcoins being accepted almost everywhere you go in the near future.
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:32:57
Coinlab was backed by Sillicon Valley Bank. So it is not a surprise they want to bring Bitcoins DOWN!
@_date: 2013-04-14 16:22:39
they already have it, it's called Facebook Credits
@_date: 2013-04-04 22:09:57
that is so messed up
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:28:24
how appropriate, they only add it when it is down 50%. shame on the gov't.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:06:05
you got me
@_date: 2013-04-04 16:48:19
another classic case of: 
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:45:00
What if more than two people had the exact same amount of transfer?
@_date: 2013-04-05 17:59:37
To answer your father's question, just tell him, Bill Gates just bought a whole datacenter full of ASIC miners just for bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:47:12
congrats, now you are in for a wild rollercoaster!
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:01:01
site doesn't look too secure
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:15:52
Very nice! I will now be referring EVERYONE who don't know about bitcoins to look at this first, finally something easy to understand for everyone!
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:34:04
i'd like to just ask for a small fee per transaction. that is all.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:45:13
if you want bitcoin news that is up-to-the MINUTE fast (perhaps even information overload), you can try bitkoins.com
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:05:04
is it true that, when you perform transfer, the only method of them tracking your deposit to your account is by the exact amount of money you put in?
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:04:25
mainly because: 
1) i am curious to see this being done on a bigger scale
2) it is a challenge to build something people will use
3) i don't have anything better to do
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:14:17
fwiw, these are the exact same type of posts a few months back when the bubble burst. it's like dejavu ... only this time, it may crash harder.
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:39:44
basically, i've been playing around with some of the open source bitcoin arbitrage scripts and have seen some success.
my friends also joined the fun but unfortunately, none of us really have the capital to truly take advantage of the arbitrage opportunity right now. since i hate seeing opportunities like this pass by, i just wanted to offer and make it available to others. i just want to see this done on a bigger scale, it's more of a curiosity than anything. i also know there probably are many who performs arbitrage as a group and wanna see how things would happen when no more arbitrage opportunity exists.
as a service, i know how most of you are paranoid about security, i'll just offer you a hosted server that has the script pre-installed and it's up to you to fill in your API keys to your mtgox/bitstamp/etc accounts. i could perhaps even put it up on a docker repository and a video walk-through setting it up for those who want to DIY.
but as josmul points out, i'm just trying to gauge interest, if there aren't, i have no real desire to put up any of this effort, which sort of seems like the case here.

Hello I am Jaequery and I welcome you to coming to this site.
You can usually reach out to me on twitter  or find me having fun in irc.Freenode.net 
I created this site mainly because bitcoin related news and sites are all over the place and hard to find a one good legit/centralized source for all bitcoin related things.
So as a starter, I wanted to just organize and review all the different sites and services out there so that other bitcoiners would have a lot easier time finding out how to do things the best way there is.
Currently at the moment, I am just aggregating bitcoin related news/stories real-time on the main page as a way to provide relevant information to the visitors. But just doing so, I have found this site to be amazingly convenient and refreshing for me. 
I am satisfied with what this site does for now but please understand my vision of this site is where you will find out: 
- Who has the best bitcoin charts on the internet?
- Where is the best place to buy bitcoins?
- Where is the best place to sell bitcoins?
- Where do I go to get started on buying bitcoins?
- What is the latest bitcoin price?
- Is now a good time to buy bitcoins?
Even I don't know the answer to these questions but once I do, I will be having a section for answering each and every one of those (and other) questions.
So it is a start and I wish to make this a fun community for bitcoiners. I thank you for stopping by. Feel free to shoot me a tweet  and say hello!

because if it seems too good to be true, it usually is
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:11:46
I second bitfloor. It's about ten times better than mtgox.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:55:29
i think it's what you call a down trend. if we can ride this one out, one thing is certain. this bubble has long ways to go before it pops. if not, we are in for a major correction, as i see it, the true value of bitcoin is somewhere around $400. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:18:03
you might want to read up on this: 
basically use bitfloor, if you want to jump through hoops, go with mtgox.
@_date: 2013-04-04 15:36:28
so there actually is a need?
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:10:04
as gold tards would say, never too late to buy, always a good time to buy!
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:59:50
that is scary, perhaps you should give them a call?
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:32:34
in a way, it is safer and easier to just keep it in a service like mtgox, especially if you are not adept at properly backing up your bitcoins, in case your hard drive fails or something, which could happen at any minute.
