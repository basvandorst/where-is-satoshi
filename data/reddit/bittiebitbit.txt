I had an issue with Armory after a Windows update back on patch Tuesday (it would sync up to 95% and then throw a C++ error and crash) but found that when I installed a new copy of Armory and removed the old, everything worked fine. 
Plus, if you have your paper backup, nothing will be lost.  Just an inconvenience.

I like [Armory](  
It's easy to use and has a strong emphasis in security.
If you use it though, you'll have to install to original [Bitcoin-QT]( first.  Some folks don't like this because Bitcoin-QT stores all transactions on your computer which can take a while and takes space.  I see it as storage is cheap and I'm in it for the security and not the speed.

When there's no Bitcoin subreddit like there's no USD, BGP, or Euro subreddit.

I use [Preev.com]( for my conversions.
So, as of right now $1=7.716mBTC=7716uBTC

The article makes Bitcoin out to be the only way (and its primary use is) to unlawfully move/launder money.  When HSBC, a well known and widely used bank, has been caught doing it time after time and most recently were found [laundering money from Mexican drug trafficking and processing banned transactions on behalf of Iran, Libya, Sudan and Burma](

And a pretty graphic to show estimated amount laundered between [HSBC and Liberty Reserve](

If the BTC-USD price stays the same or goes lower, you'll have a terrible return and a pretty useless piece of equipment outside of mining.  If it sky rockets, you'll have a great return.
Depends on if you're a gambling man...

"...between 60 and 75 percent of his company’s expenses are for regulatory compliance. CampBX requires users to submit a government-issued ID and a utility bill before joining."
Something's wrong when that much of a companies expense goes to regulatory compliance.
