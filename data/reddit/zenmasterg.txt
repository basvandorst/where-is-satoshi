I cant even start a discussion with my parents. My mother still believe that money is backed by gold and I have no idea of how to prove her otherwise (we live in scandinavia, and most of what I hear is from the US). My dad keeps saying that if I earn money on my investments its because somebody else lost money, so it is basically stealing in his eyes.

This is really interesting, because Cryptos main function until now (maybe besides "criminal" exchanges ) is to provide a safe haven for fiat crash. So some may desperately sell their Cryptos cause they lost their job or w/e, and others may buy Cryptos cause their other assets a crumbling... Or?
