Yes, I had the same experience with btce. It takes a while for the confirmations, the fees, and the lower BTC rates add up. Unless you're a bot I guess the only real choice is long-term value investing.

Yeah man but someone out there has .00009 so we have to be grateful.

You say that since over time, as I trade the fee goes down or for another reason?

Tried instant buy for the first time when it was $1052. Thought it was going to instantly buy it at $1052 before it went back up to $1062, but it bought it at $1062 instead.

So basically keep doing this until I have more Bitcoins? This is quite insane! Does anyone have experience automating this and has anyone published any results on lag  vs. bid / ask?

Yes, I thought you were a day trading wiz ready to set me on a journey. :/

If you teach me how to thread water I'll learn how to swim shallower waters until I get to that point. I have read [why I don't trade stocks and (probably) neither should you]( and I heard "small individual investors who follow many tenets of the philosophy of value investing have consistently beat[en] the market." This applies to BTC and other companies like TSLA and SpaceX don't you think?

I lost like $10 in fees and in timing, what can I do to avoid this?

I just noticed that if I would have sold my .025 and added it up when I was 2/3 fiat it would have added to $496. I was wondering if that small increment was not enough to sell. I think I should wait until it's a 20+ difference because it doesn't add up with small increases because of the fees.
