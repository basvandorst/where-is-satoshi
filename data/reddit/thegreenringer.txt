So sort of like Daemon, if you’ve ever read the book. A decentralized AI based on a few simple rules takes over all of society. It’s an interesting idea, but you still have a government. Your government is just a decentralized AI instead of a human.

I think it's fair to compare it to, say, the attacks on Native Americans during the founding of the US.
I don't see how machine guns on apartment roofs are going to stop an invader from driving tanks through city streets, taking down the machine guns and executing anyone caught putting one up. It might be a bit harder in rural areas, but once they have control of the cities and have established a government it would be easy enough to deal with the rural areas one at a time, until the holdouts just give up.

If you don't have a government or military, who is going to protect you once you get invaded by a country that does?

Bitcoin's protocol is pretty simple, at least in terms of what it's trying to accomplish (ledger of transactions). A protocol designed to move troops around and wage war would probably need to contain at least a few ground rules on military strategy, which is what I'd call AI. Otherwise you'd end up with "twitch plays war" and get destroyed.

I hate to break it to you, but in that case whoever is in charge of your militia is your defacto government.
