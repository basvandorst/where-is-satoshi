I agree with you. If people want to do other lists that's fine. He's using our list name though, he's claiming to represent us and [be the official source]( for the name we use.
This could end up hurting our efforts and has already confused at least two Bitcoin news sites.

Split your coins into multiple wallets, hide them away. But yes, the framers of the constitution had this discussion a lot too. Democracy is frightening. Ultimately miners will hold a lot of coins. Miners will be a very powerful minority on the network, you most likely won't need to worry.

I rewrote it to highlight why this entire post is insane. Replacing "Bitcoin" with the Internet and "Money" with information leads to an interesting read. Enjoy,
An early obituary for the Internet
The Internet is not over yet. But the pseudo-information gateway is close enough to collapse to merit an early retrospective.
My prediction is controversial. Many fervent fans are persuaded that this gatekeeper-free information is for real. Their ardour may keep it going for a while, but equally the Internet could disappear very quickly – that’s the way with speculative bubbles. So now is the moment to learn some economic lessons before the whole phenomenon is forgotten. Here are five.
Information without government censorship appeals to people without law.
Legal information has the backing of the issuing state. The government has a proprietary interest in maintaining a reliable source of information. It also has the necessary powers to do so. It can regulate learning institutions, pursue fraud and create new information to keep the system afloat.
the Internet has none of that protection. On the contrary, governments are either hostile or hands-off. For anyone in the legal publishing industry, the lack of official support is a significant negative. For anyone in the illegal publishing industries, though, the extra-legal status is a positive. Unsurprisingly, the only real business actually to rely on the Internet – not merely issue press releases about planning to accept the tokens – has been Napster, a now-closed electronic exchange for illegal music.
Speculative fever can alight on almost anything.
the Internet is a pretty unlikely target. After all, the more the value of the would-be information changes, the less it looks like real information – so the more liable it is to lose all value whenever the speculators get tired or wise. David Yermack of New York University’s Stern School of Business explained in a recent paper that the unstable information on the Internet – in the last three months, its Wikipedia entries has quadrupled, then almost halved and increased by about half – leaves it without two of the three basic attributes of information. the Internet is neither a reliable source of fact nor a helpful unit of history.
Yermack kindly says the Internet satisfies the third attribute – it can be, and occasionally has been, a medium of exchange. But if speculators were thinking clearly, they would stay away from any supposed information which books don’t accept. After all, books are involved in almost all exchanges in today’s information.
The current information system is worth complaining about.
The Internet is the wrong answer to a good question: what can be done to make the information system less crazy? After so many books needed to be rewritten in 2008, and after five subsequent years of weird information policy, it’s clear that the question is legitimate. Something is badly wrong.
People can be excused for thinking that governments, including central publishing houses, have run the information system so poorly that non-governmental information might be better, but that is the wrong answer. The only practical right answer is to improve the government-run information system.
Central publishing houses seem to have learned how to reduce consumer information volatility, which was the scourge of the first decades of purely written books. Now the information authorities need to figure out how to reduce the volatility of newspapers, misreporting flows and foreign information exchange rates. And the base information interest rates should be high enough to give readers a real return.
Information is misunderstood.
Admittedly, information is complicated. It is a social token as well as an economic tool. It is a store of value, but its own value shifts constantly. It is considered a safe and solid asset – “like letters on a page” – but writers cannot really promise always to make good on legitimate demands to liquidate history.
I sympathise with anyone who does not want to try to understand how censorship works, but information ignorance can be dangerous. Many the Internet investors will find that out, to their personal cost.
The whole economy paid dearly for similar misunderstandings by Western Christianity and Protestants. They did not really consider the risks of the printing press and wild information creation by non-governmental individuals and institutions. If they had, there would have been no need afterwards to turn so many of them into quasi-governmental religious institutions.
Too much entrepreneurial energy is wasted.
the Internet is basically idle speculation, but it has inspired a great deal of skilled work. This small business – total value of a mere $100 million a year ago, now about $10 billion – has generated scores of websites and seemingly unlimited quantities of enthusiastic and evangelistic commentary. The original programmer, the producers of new information and the creators of a remarkable number of sophisticated the Internet exchanges are all are very good.
A society in which no project ever attracted this sort of attention, intelligence and ambition would be moribund. The the Internet mania shows that ours is still quite alive. But it is a bit discouraging to see so much of what is good in our economy directed to something so misguided.

Monetas is BUILDING.
Ripple is already built. It's already most of the essential things OT does.
All that XRP is is an anti-spam token. OT will need something similar, imo, if it is to survive, otherwise the whole network will get demolished. 
You can ALREADY go between gold, euros, dollars, silver, whatever on the Ripple network. Why are you asking for a new project when an already successful one exists and is functioning.
I think you have some misunderstandings about XRP and the Ripple network.

It's mainly to make it more of an event.
We make sure all the deals are easily read and viewed the day of. Additionally some of the smaller merchants have difficulties setting up their deals to go live during the day, so the coupon code they submit could be used earlier than Friday.
What I am doing with my friends this year is essentially buying 3x as much BTC as I need. I'll be purchasing anything they want and getting USD from them later.
Additionally we'll be having credit card Bitcoin purchasing options on the site this year. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 21:34:38
We're publishing a preview of the deals on Wednesday. If it looks like your deal should be kept hidden until Friday we'll hold it.

Technically Bitcoin is disflationary. This only affects users if they hold BTC as a currency and don't use it at a payment processor/network.
Yes. Bitcoin was **NEVER** designed to be the catch all for consumer transactions. It is to transfer value without trusting anyone else. That's it.
Here's an article on the 51% attack: 
Sure, but right now there are more than enough miners just competing for the block reward. Even if there was no financial incentive, plenty of people would still contribute power to help the network. The bigger issue at hand is the de-democratization of Bitcoin mining. Too many investment groups are getting involved, it makes it harder for individuals to make meaningful contributions to the network.
@_date: 2014-10-01 20:11:03
There might be an altcoin section if enough merchants sign up.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:31:02

@_date: 2014-07-31 20:39:29
Where do you work and do they accept BTC?
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:47:17
There are more factors in play than just the price.
We're likely going to hit around 1200 merchants offering deals this year. Other than the smaller, well-known Bitcoin businesses like Bees Brothers and Gyft, there are some absolutely massive deals being offered by the bigger companies who announced Bitcoin acceptance this year.
Last year I think I personally only spent around 300-400 bucks worth of coin (half a bitcoin) on BBF.
This year, I'm thinking I might stock up and buy closer to a thousand dollars worth, just based on some of the deals I've seen come in.

some midget wearing a VISA/MasterCard logo foam suit enters the scene and runs up into a church.
He exits a couple seconds later with a bagful of cash and nuns chase after him, he screams over his shoulder "3-5% transaction fees, sista!"
End scene, fade to black. Simple text in middle of the screen: Bitcoin doesn't charge organizations any transaction fees. Stop giving card companies their cut. Bitcoin.org.

Good prices that beat normal Black Friday deals is a good incentive to learn how to use bitcoin.

At least two. We'll be going with CloudFlare this year. We're also going to distribute our website on plain html/css sites cloned around the web (and TOR for those who want it). Are there any decentralized hosting platforms yet?

Not a blacklist. Reputation/identity system. 
@_date: 2014-11-27 02:57:15
The site looked good until all the deals went through the js.
At that point it got sluggish and awful :(

Yup, I'll make sure to hit them up!
@_date: 2014-11-27 08:38:26
We've got it more or less sorted at this point. Thank you so much for offering though! We should be ready for a re-launch tomorrow morning.
@_date: 2014-11-28 20:39:45
Generally you need to do some research before you purchase from anyone. Obviously the big guys like NewEgg are fine. There are lots of sites that review Bitcoin merchants though.
@_date: 2014-10-25 06:03:05
Hey! Make sure you sign up with the 'list a deal' option and put your deal up :)

Hey guys, Jon Holmquist here.
Let me know if you have any questions about bbf2014 (on November 28th!)
We're shooting for 6000 merchants to sign up this year.

This is pretty huge. Country music fans can get discounts only if they use Bitcoin. 
[Wikipedia lists some of his songs] ( going as high as  on the country music charts. 
"Use Bitcoin, be smart, be in control of your money." He gets it.

Take a look at my article about how to get your store ready for BBF :) 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:49:53
Sure. I haven't seen it happening, be the first! ;)
@_date: 2014-01-10 21:49:05
And who uses it?
Open Transactions is too academic. I see Ripple as a much needed extension on Bitcoin's initial ideas to help facilitate merchant transactions. It lets you send other currencies through the internet like a Bitcoin.
Don't get tripped up on the 'premine' FUD about Ripple, take another look at it.
XRP is decentralized, initial distribution wasn't. At this point, billions of XRP are out there, no one group controls who can use the network.

Deals go live the 26th.
Unless the deals merchants submitted look like they're more time sensitive then I'll hold them.

We're focusing mainly on the larger merchants right now. If you know of a smaller store (other than Bees Bros) that you trust, please hit them up. We also have two staffers who are going to be reaching out systematically to merchants and charities. 
Actually, if you want to help coordinate...  Work off of this, people can update who they reached out to.

One big issue we might have this year is merchants thinking they're set since they signed up last year. We need a new submission for this year. I think I can get a list of currently signed up merchants later tonight.

I had a buddy that does paper wallets, I could get him to do a festive one if you think there is demand for that.
Alternatively we're doing a big push for charitable giving this year, perhaps a gift in someone's name would be appropriate?

Some of the processors and wallets are working towards that, insurance/some sort of consumer protection, but I haven't seen much yet.

Overstock has always been supportive of the community. Their participation will help increase press for Bitcoin.
I don't see why they'd choose to stop being supportive now.

@_date: 2014-11-24 16:51:27
Having them do some small sale or deal exclusively for Bitcoiners increases the appeal of Bitcoin and will help bring in additional press.
It highlights Bitcoin as a cost saving tool and seems like an easy way to support a currency Overstock already is extremely supportive of.

To build up Bitcoin, we need usage. To make Bitcoin useful and stable, we need volume. I'm sorry your pump and dump is getting interrupted, but it's better to build a sustainable price than to steal profits from new unfortunate investors.

Good man.
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:58:04
The website we had yesterday (or more specifically the crappy javascript) could not handle all the 500 deals listed on it.
We kicked out most of the resource intensive code, make the deals bigger, and tried to keep it simple. 
Everything should work now, I'm sorry about the hassle yesterday, we've been working straight through the night to get it fixed.
@_date: 2014-11-24 15:56:22
I'm not concerned about that, I'm concerned that they're just keeping the same deals as they normally do.
By doing that the reinforce Bitcoin as just being a payment option, not as being something bigger with a community behind it.
@_date: 2015-01-01 19:14:50
The biggest issue is that scammers can always pay the highest advertisement cost since they have basically no costs of their own.

@_date: 2016-11-23 23:50:31
Merchant and consumer use of Bitcoin is not rising.
Unique uses like Ledger or OpenBazaar are doing well, but conventional merchants won't do mega-volume with Bitcoin simply because there aren't a whole lot of Bitcoin consumers out there.
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:36:32
It's coming back this year, a lot of repeat merchants who've participated year over year are going to be involved.
Some deals will be teased Wednesday.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:37:35
Then people don't see it the day of, miss out, complain, rinse and repeat.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:37:08
A lot of 'known Bitcoin' companies is how I'd describe it.
There should be some good deals.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:49:26
There are *tons* of merchants that accept Bitcoin.
It's the consumer front that is sorely lacking, but I think that is a bigger problem than simply pushing it.
For the vast majority of consumers there is no reason to use Bitcoin over their credit cards. They simply don't care enough to switch, it is a system that with all its faults works for them.
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:44:49
Would it make you as a buyer be more likely to purchase if you saw at a merchant that they keep the Bitcoin they earn?
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:38:20
It actually started out as a Friday in November before Black Friday.
We've avoided doing Cyber Monday just out of tradition... plus a lot of stores already do their own promotions for that.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:48:20
This event is mainly for Bitcoiners to enjoy spending their Bitcoin... not to get the best deal of the year. 
Bigger firms tend to be able to offer those 'unbeatable' deals.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:39:22
I've done multiple interviews stating that consumer Bitcoin spending is trending down and merchant adoption is pretty much stagnant. 
It's still a fun event for people who still participate in the Bitcoin community though.
@_date: 2016-11-25 00:11:57
Might be based on local browser info...
That's a bug.

I'll look at getting it mobile ready for launch. Last year we had a mobile list page that was easier to look at.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:50:41
We do our best to sort through each offering and check for any phishing sites.
The ones that tend to actually bite people are new sites that just don't deliver what they're selling and have no reputation behind them.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:39:49
A lot of the merchants ship physical goods, so a slightly delayed txn shouldn't be too big of an issue... but yeah, it's a problem.
@_date: 2016-11-20 15:35:37
This, thank you.
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:49:50

They're up now :)
@_date: 2016-11-24 19:51:45
We'll see, I think that'll be more dependent on what gambling sites do on Friday, they tend to spam more txns than shoppers do.
@_date: 2016-11-23 23:57:32
Hey man, everyone does there small part in the community. Most people who use Bitcoin are investors and holders, I'm not here to knock them at all.

.info was the scam last year.
There are tons of posts on bitcointalk about the scammer last year.

I don't know why you would be targeted... Try a new account on the freerolls.
@_date: 2011-07-21 20:30:25
I would like to argue that. The bug you are talking about is something that I've seen happen on flash games. It is something to do with YOUR client because I've seen no one else complain about it. You haven't tried hard enough to fix the bug with YOUR client. Please don't spew slander about a perfectly fine poker site because you're too lazy to switch web browsers.
@_date: 2011-09-26 00:01:41
It is possible to check for collusion. We've already banned a couple colluders on BTC On Tilt. Players that collude have a different playing style that is consistant over many hands and that style of play can be detected.

It's up, you might need to flush your cache. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 15:58:03
Half the reason we don't release the deals until the day of is due to smaller merchants not putting time limits on their coupons or sales. They don't want their customers taking advantage of the deals for a week, they can only afford a single day.
Now, as for pumping the site, this is a community event. Every year there is someone the day after that complains that they didn't see any news that the event was on going. It is incredibly difficult to inform every member of a decentralized community about something, so I do apologize if it seems like aggressive advertising. 
Another reason why you might be feeling misled is that the .info site promised 'early' offers for their newsletter. I haven't seen a single actual deal from them either. We've (the .com) never promised that.
@_date: 2015-11-27 13:37:39
Sorry about that, you can try this link, it should work better on mobile:

@_date: 2015-11-12 02:36:58
2013 was around 500 merchants, we tried to double that with last year's event but we ended up with around 600 or so merchants.
Most of them didn't receive sales because they were extremely random, small, new, or had no reputation.
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:27:36
Uh, I'm running the .com. I've done it for four years and came up with it.

Hey there, you can PM me on here if you'd like.
I'm Jon Holmquist from Bitcoin Black Friday
@_date: 2015-11-27 15:47:02
I went through all the sites pretty throughly this year. Optical looks like it has been up for a year or so, but as always with Bitcoin shopping, do your own research and be careful.
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:00:09
Unfortunately I doubt we have any TV deals that will beat Target.
Bitcoin merchants who are involved in the community tend to be smaller and provide unique products. They really aren't wholesalers, the larger merchants who do accept Bitcoin can't focus their attentions on BTC because it's still way too small for them.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:29:52
We're probably not going to get any Bitcoin-specific Newegg deals this year. 
The volume that Bitcoiners can provide just isn't enough for most of the big guys.
Last year I bought Bitcoin shirts, a wallet from a small UK shop, artwork, tons of honey, tea, and a bunch of other gifts from small shops. 
The small shops are the ones who really support the Bitcoin community. Thank you for supporting them too!
@_date: 2015-11-09 16:55:40
Yeah, last year could have gone better. I learned a lot from watching a website get kneecapped and absolutely destroyed. This year will go a lot smoother. We've refocused on providing a quality experience.
@_date: 2011-10-07 08:47:09
[Coinabul.com]( sells gold, ounce.me lists gold prices, I think bitcoin is moving to become gold backed!
@_date: 2015-11-20 14:07:22
There were some technical issues in the morning last year. They were all fixed and after that it was the same as any year.
There are deals and Bitcoiners spend their BTC. What more do you want?
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:28:31
Also a healthy economy with spending tends to help the price, especially in the long run.
@_date: 2015-11-19 16:30:14
Well, generally people just search "item + Bitcoin" on Google and find what they need.
I agree it's not the best solution.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:59:06
Deals don't go live until the 27th.
Most of the smaller merchants set up their deals and don't necessarily make them time sensitive, so unfortunately we have to wait until the day of.
We'll be posting on this subreddit to remind you once the deals are up, so don't worry :)
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:16:07
They added the phishing sites mid-day, featured them, and sent out newsletters about it.
It's a scam.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:19:43
Focusing more on the merchants and deals this year. 
@_date: 2015-11-24 18:11:50
Well, you can always go on the site later at night, if you still want to do conventional Black Friday shopping. Doesn't have to be one way or the other.
Thank you for your feedback though, I'll think about it.
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:06:55
It has in the past. The market has been pretty stable for the last year. We're just seeing some volatility, so honestly, who knows where it'll go.
@_date: 2015-11-11 22:20:16
The guidelines are whether the merchant has existed for any meaningful amount of time and if they're not a scam.
Not very strict. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 07:12:33
They registered the site less than two months ago.
There was a different site last year that was more focused on 'bitcoin deals' than black friday itself.
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:35:47
We actually originally branded as BitcoinFriday! I also didn't do it on the conventional Black Friday the first year :)

Fixed already, flush cache and re-check.

Nobody's mom or dad is using Bitcoin to buy anything right now anyways.
I set my mom up with a coinbase wallet and she's used it once or twice. Only after I prompted her to use it. 
The 'savings' you get from using Bitcoin aren't worth the complexity and risk. Consumers have the option right now to get a credit card with cash back rewards amounting to around the same savings and often don't care about that. They go with convenience.
That being said, there are things Bitcoin is doing well right now, namely international shopping / purchasing expensive or valuable things / and p2p transfer. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 03:06:23
Actually, the price has generally risen. Investor sentiment tends to go higher into the holidays.
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:15:12
I've pinged a couple people I know at Namecheap about the issue, hopefully they can take down the phishing sites.
As a sidenote: I run BitcoinBlackFriday.com, that is not a scam or phishing site, I'm very public about who I am. I am not some anonymous person like the person running .info is.
@_date: 2015-11-27 07:11:25
Deals go live shortly.
@_date: 2016-10-18 17:56:33
2013 was the peak for sure.

Howdy Geoff.
I'm no longer associated with BTC On Tilt. I quit about 2 months ago. 
I have the phone numbers and full names of the admins behind the site. I know that they invested a lot of money into the site, so it doesn't make sense that they went AWOL.
In any case, I'll release their information in a couple days if they don't respond soon. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 18:06:08
I was juggling school + BBF last year. This year I'm full-time preparing for this Black Friday. It won't be a mess.

@_date: 2011-07-21 05:59:46
It's been picking up players each day. We're up to 34 logins right now. I saw it go a little bit higher earlier. 
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:19:05
Eh not really.
It's a readjustment of what a lot of people figured Bitcoin would be like.
Merchant adoption did not spur more consumer adoption. That feedback loop just failed to take off. For Bitcoin consumerism to succeed, there needs to be more consumers. Until that happens, it's best to focus on the places the Bitcoin consumers shop. 
I'm actually incredibly impressed at how well Bitcoin payment processors did at getting merchants on-board. The issue is that there aren't enough consumers to go around. Consumer growth is slow, steady, and takes time.
It also helps how many companies are coming out that help/provide new tools for consumers. That'll help attract more people in.
@_date: 2015-11-27 14:16:57
We'll probably push a fix today to redirect mobile to the list-view.

@_date: 2015-11-28 02:57:17
Yup. I remember that email you sent to me.
I spent a long time this year going through each and every site to verify that they were legit.
Buying stuff with Bitcoin is always risky, especially with smaller merchants, I wouldn't wish getting scammed on anyone.
@_date: 2015-11-17 23:03:46
We generally don't reveal the full list or merchants until the day of, we tend to tease some deals leading up during the week of.
@_date: 2015-11-24 16:39:43
Half of the time it's a fairly easy to find landing page with the offer too ;)
If you really think it's that big of an issue we could try and release a limited list early. We can also plan it for next year.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:11:00
I like how they shared quite publicly about your email reading habits.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:58:46
Most of the merchants are in the US but it's open to everyone

Generally, people are lazy and wait for 1-6 confirmations. If you were running a larger business and wanted to streamline the process you'd have some in-house ways of optimizing transactions.
Is there a specific situation you're asking for?
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:07:07
It's all about the fees. Because you can do a chargeback, so can the next consumer. There is no way to protect against it. It drives prices way up.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:40:37
Then step up and speak for yourself.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:58:31
We have merchants all around the world, where are you interested in shipping to?

That 25% belongs to Roger Ver I believe: 
He's a notable Bitcoin evangelist and investor.
I also know Zootreeves very well. Never found anything fishy about his operation. He is not very social because he's constantly clearing support tickets :P

The big argument is whether people will use XRP to send value across the network.
I personally think that trusted USD will probably take that role or even BTC.

@_date: 2013-04-23 16:22:16
Internet cash. Can't be controlled by a government or squashed by a monopoly. Cannot be bought out.
The biggest problem with the current payment processing industry is that a corporate cartel has made it impossible for any startups to (legally or financially) enter and revolutionize the space. And if any startups do manage to make enough waves, they get bought out immediately.
What we end up is the same banking system that we've had for the last 40 years... 40 years ago when ATMs were introduced.
What Bitcoin does extremely well is allow any company, any person to move money internationally, for little to no fees. 
This will eventually allow a more global online economy to flourish, unhindered by the chains of an ancient banking system.

I would have killed to have a central company with an entire biz dev unit, PR unit, legal department and lobbying group behind Bitcoin in 2011.
Not to mention that Ripple Labs can't do anything to keep people off the network now that the server code is open source.
Don't get me wrong, I'm still a huge proponent of Bitcoin, but it makes no sense for (or to) the average consumer, where Ripple can be used without any knowledge by the consumer!

This is a community event, dedicated to supporting the average Bitcoin merchant.
Bitcoin Friday is simply a website listing deals from merchants who accept Bitcoin payments, the deals are available for one day only, November 29th this year.
Not many bitcoiners realize how hard it is dealing with price fluctuations as a merchant. There were fears about hoarding last year... This year, the fear is whether big merchants will continue to adopt Bitcoin after sub par demand after adoption.
Let's prove that there is demand. Let's spend some bitcoin and support the new backbone of the Bitcoin economy, the merchants.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:15:34

Walls of security: If you lose bitcoins, they're gone. If you lose fiat on another wallet, you complain, and they claw the funds back. Most Bitcoin wallets need to be made more secure if anything.
Debit/Credit/PayPal: No, you cannot use these common financial instruments for the same reason you need more security in a Bitcoin wallet. They can claw funds back if a customer complains. So, customer buys BTC, complains, gets back fiat, then also gets the coins he already bought.
Accessible: BitPay.com, Coinbase, a host of other companies are making it way easier to use and accept Bitcoin.
There is still a lot of infrastructure to be built. You're still using a beta software.

If they seem to be interested in the ATM example, you can go on and explain a bit about double bookkeeping and how it started a golden age in Italy and how Bitcoin has now introduced triple bookkeeping.
If I'm dealing with a more conservative, less tech-oriented crowd, I like to go into the ramifications of a currency that cannot be counterfeited. For a country to adopt Bitcoin-like technologies would safeguard the national currency from economic terrorism and disarm criminal groups and nations that fund their operations through counterfeiting (Looking at you North Korea!).

BitcoinStore only accepts Bitcoin. That's literally the cheapest place to buy electronics online. 
What I see is that the Silkroad growth from this point has been very steady. It has already done its huge growth spurt.
The legitimate Bitcoin economy has only begun to grow and it's already bigger than the Silkroad.

Satoshi mined the first block and burned the bitcoins, witnesses heard him mutter, "let there be light".
The first block is not spendable. Also there don't need to be any transactions in a block for it to be found.

I'm telling you to not use it since you don't support it.
I don't think it's at all exploitative. That money is mostly going to supporting the network IMO. 
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:44:41
Let me lay it down for you:
Bitcoin is online cash. Just like cash in the offline world, using it is nearly free, plus, since it's digital, you can send money around the world, to anyone, as easily as sending an email.
Bitcoin was 'created' in 2009 by an anonymous programmer named Satoshi Nakamoto. He essentially wrote the initial code that has since been reviewed by hundreds of known and respected coders and white hat security experts. 
So, what is the big deal about Bitcoin? Before Bitcoin you could not send a digital file through the internet that had value associated with it. If you tried, the recipient would simply copy paste the data file and counterfeit money. Bitcoin solves this problem through this thing called a decentralized ledger. This is exactly the same system your bank uses, where the teller writes down account balances in a big book, plus one big thing: everyone on the Bitcoin network uses the same book and puts all transactions into the ledger (also called the blockchain). The network acts as the CPA or bank teller, writing down all the transactions that occur.
Once everyone is on the same page (pun intended) how can you counterfeit new coins? If you know where every coin is, how can someone give you a fake one?
With Bitcoin, you possess a private key that allows you to spend bitcoins in your account. That's the key to your account listed on the public ledger. 
At this point you're probably concerned, anyone can see your transactions right? Yup! But all the accounts are tokenized. There is no information associated with an account, making it psuedo-anonymous. It's a private account, like they used to do in Switzerland.
Let me know if you have any more questions!
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:49:36

Once your money is in BTC you can do pretty much anything with it much faster than through conventional money payment.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:41:15

@_date: 2013-04-23 16:28:37
If your audience is interested in the blockchain or can't wrap their head around how a decentralized system like Bitcoin can work, I like to use one major example: a card game.
Imagine you're playing a card game with your family members at home. You have 4 players playing the game. Everyone at the table knows the rules of the game, all the cards are visible in the player's hands or unused in the deck in the middle of the table. Because all the players know the rules, no referee is needed. No centralized power. If one of the players starts cheating, the other three players will notice and stop playing with that player. Because there are set rules, the cards in the middle of the deck get distributed in an orderly fashion, in a predictable manner. The cards are individual bitcoins, the deck is essentially the block reward and how new coins are introduced into the system, and the card players are miners, that verify any transactions that occur during the players. 
I feel like this example is immediately graspable to pretty much anyone globally.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:25:17
I like Ripple for the PR department.

It'll keep dividing approaching zero. It'll actually hit zero once it hits the current decimal place in 2140. Presumably that decimal place will be moved over in the future, meaning it should continue onwards.
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:43:18
Speculation I guess.

Reddit admins undoubtedly have your IP if they care to get it.
What I'm saying it getting you to view an image embedded on reddit somehow (don't think that's possible) or more likely getting you to click a link to a trusted site that then hosts your image will get your ip.
Forum trolls do this on Bitcointalk all the time. A nice little transparent png that they send over PM.
@_date: 2013-10-13 04:44:47
An attempt at even more ELI5:
Ripple lets banks talk to each other and send money like words. These banks can send words that have value tied to them. Allowing you to send money to anyone that you can talk to online!

Something I like to try:
Bitcoin is a tool with qualities that even governments could use. Imagine if a U.S. dollar could not be counterfeited. Small businesses wouldn't get burned by counterfeit bills (They don't get the money if they discover one! Whoever is holding the bomb when it bursts loses the money.) Organized crime wouldn't be able to use counterfeiting to fund their operations. And, most importantly, terrorists and governments like North Korea wouldn't be able to make hundreds of millions of dollars each year by printing fake dollar bills. 
The technology Bitcoin provides is revolutionary. Even if Bitcoin itself doesn't succeed in the long run, the advances it has made in payments will be around for years to come.

Ripple allows you to white label Bitcoin solutions.
That is why I like Ripple. I see it as being the only real way to mainstream math-based currency.

2: Not decentralized if run on Facebook's servers. Those servers would be a massive target. They can copy Bitcoin's mining technique I think. Perhaps blocks would be found faster to shorten txns? I think if Facebook created a payment processor on top of the slower network that could work.
4: You don't really need coins to manipulate the price.
6: Network effect. People don't really buy things on Facebook. Would work better if Amazon did it.

@_date: 2013-11-11 23:38:48
When you use a normal wallet, you're exposing the private key to your dirty computer filled with viruses and malware.
However, when you have an isolated paper wallet, the private key is only used once you want to spend your coins. This means the private key is only exposed once you want to buy something or send a txn. 
Your public key can be known everywhere, it has no power. Your private key lets you send transactions.
@_date: 2013-11-28 09:58:27
That's why we're aiming for the mainstream this year!
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:16:40

There's an incredibly small chance of opening up a wallet with the same key pair. All your computer program is doing is doing is saying here's this wallet, check on funds or sign transactions.

Assuming not American, Bitcoin 'Black Friday' replicates the American hallmark holiday of consumerism called Black Friday. The idea is merchants compete for a massive increase in shoppers interested in purchasing holiday gifts the day after thanksgiving. Merchants offer some ridiculous deals and these deals often cause fights to break out at wal-marts across the nation.
Bitcoin Black Friday is simply a list of deals Bitcoin merchants will offer on November 29th, and a pr cannon of positive Bitcoin news that reminds Bitcoin consumers to spend a couple bitcoins and support the Bitcoin economy.
@_date: 2013-04-04 21:34:53

I'd recommend a conventional cc processor (feefighters.com!) for the time being. You're not limited to only accepting one processor though. So you have a BTC processor and a CC processor.
BitPay is then good for your btc processing needs. There haven't been any fully featured bitcoin processors... yet.

ELI5: Ripple connects any company holding customer funds in a digital form. Furthermore it lets any user place orders on its decentralized order book.
This means a company could issue CompanyUSD and let users buy Bitcoin from ANY other company or user selling bitcoins.
All it is doing is taking the internal ledger and order book exchanges have and importing them onto the decentralized network.

Bitcoin is really, really good for e-commerce. 
Just like a bankwire.

The EFF has been talked to about Bitcoin and their stance on it multiple times.
They have recently promised a change on their stance, but have not yet followed through.
They do not deserve any money for late promises and all the hurt they have done to Bitcoin.
They don't simply not accept Bitcoin,  they *accepted* Bitcoin and then shut it down. They showed other businesses **like the Humble Bundle** that accepting Bitcoin is risky and legally a bad move.
If a firm full of lawyers can't take Bitcoin because of legal risk, who can?
Now even the Humble Bundle accepts Bitcoin. The EFF should give an apology to the entire Bitcoin community and reverse their decision ASAP.
@_date: 2013-11-14 20:24:08
A lot has happened over the last 6 months. You should reexamine the company/network.
I think the biggest argument I could make to you is that you don't need to support the developers who are betting on XRP. 
Get 75 XRP (&gt;$1) let it sit in your wallet, never send value over XRP, and the entire network is open to you.
You don't need any great amount of XRP to use the system.

Mt. Gox is having issues on the fiat side. That means speculators can move BTC off the exchange, but their USD withdrawals are delayed. So if you need to move your money off the exchange, you need to buy BTC... meaning your MtGoxUSD is worth less than a more smoothly running exchange, as BTC demand is artificially inflated specifically on Mt.Gox.

Past the infrastructure issues, which is a whole 'nother discussion, it's extremely complicated to explain Bitcoin to both merchants and users. Coinbase is trying to be a rail on top of the Bitcoin network, but they don't plug into existing financial networks. That's what Ripple can do, provide many many rails and bridge all these networks, without the end user even knowing.

There are a lot of variables you can take into consideration:
Do you know the buyer?
Is it a high-risk transaction?
Is it a high-value transaction?
Basically you can establish how trustworthy the transaction looks before just accepting it. I wouldn't recommend accepting any transaction above coffee-purchase levels without a confirmation. Pulling a double spend off at this point is extremely difficult and costly, but still plausible.

Last year we called it Bitcoin Friday. The big issue with that name is that an average internet user will not immediately recognize what the event is for. Black Friday in the United States is an extremely well known event.

Buying drugs with Bitcoin is insane. Seriously, think it out. Let's buy something entirely illegal, from a seller I don't know, which a currency where my transaction to the seller is publicly broadcasted and to whom I give my address. 
It would take just a little effort from the feds to shut it down.

Depends on where it gets adoption from. You have to see where it's pulling value from to know how it will affect.

People used cash because they needed a common way to trade value. It is extremely hard to barter some food from the local supermarket if you're a barber and the grocer has already had his hair cut. Or in the alternative situation, getting your hair cut by offering food to a well-fed/stocked barber.
However, if you use something that is scarce, which people accept as having a certain amount of value, you can take things people will pay for on occasion, like a haircut, then spend it later at the grocery store. It makes it easier for people to trade.
Now, onto Bitcoin. Bitcoin has come along and made it *much* easier for people online to interact and send value.
It is very hard for a seller to accept a currency other than their own, since it doesn't have any accepted value in their own country. However, if everyone just uses Bitcoin, you cash out at your local exchange and everything is cheery and takes less time with less fees. 
The reason this has never existed before is that it was difficult to accept any data as having value, since you can just copy paste whatever your money data was, and become a Zimbabwe millionaire. Bitcoin solved that problem with a decentralized ledger. Now people can agree that certain ledger accounts have value. Meaning people have data (private keys) with value that they can't simply copy paste to get more.

I haven't seen any solid statistics, there are underlying trends that are building demand. There is no one 'reason'. It's an economy like any other with many many variables. Maybe one big buyer (former facebook exec?) decided to enter the market at that point and prompted a rally.

Just buy some more BTC the day of with Coinbase and you'll be fine!
@_date: 2013-11-04 17:40:24
What do you do normally?
Charge for it in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:25:34
I'd probably use Bitstamp, simple bank transfer and you're set. So you make an account, do a SEPA transfer, then buy BTC on their exchange.

Depends on the product. Try a couple different products and see how they compare. Generic always does better.

I'd like an actual number so I could be happier stating it in PR.

Yes, but market liquidity is a great thing.
Obviously if you're holding BTC reserves, you want everyone to hoard for the price to go up... But realistically, for healthy growth you want the system to be usable, meaning you need liquidity, money coming in and coming out of exchanges.

Exactly like you said, they can instantly convert that BTC into USD or whatever their local currency is.
That reduces their currency risk.
A business can use a turn-key solution like BitPay to process their Bitcoin transactions. BitPay handles the BTC, sells them, and sends USD to the merchant's bank account.

We screened all the companies we could. We threw out plenty of scam sites.
The sites that slipped through were either new or had no scam reports associated with them.
This illustrates a need for a more filled platform for Bitcoin consumers, with trust ratings built in.

No, you pay them 5 dollah

I'm not trying to underplay the importance of SilkRoad. They definitely fueled Bitcoin's early stages.
But we're past that.
Any more significance added to their part of Bitcoin's history will be detrimental.

I'll send a note to some of their guys about that.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:01:00
Make it easy to buy and use.
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:27:47
Kakah kaka kaaah!
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:27:07
Do explain how?
The way transactions are approved is not through computing power/proof of work, but through trust instead. That's still a decentralized model, just different from what you are used to.

That's the entire point of BitcoinStore.
There is 0% margin, the goal is not profit.

And great job Reddit taking the Ripple logo for the post &gt;_&gt;

I'm planning on going soon, impromptu Bitcoin meetup?
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:37:07
Holmes from FFTF is going on to talk about Bitcoin Black Friday soon!
@_date: 2013-11-11 23:40:46
There are discussions about off-chain processing. I'd follow the dev team mailing list. There's a good wiki page about scaling too.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:32:03
Haha, awesome! :)
What'd you get last year?
@_date: 2013-03-31 10:00:41
Excuse me, let me go get some tinfoil to make hats.

Cyber Monday is such a weird occurrence. When ecommerce first started people held off doing their Black Friday deals until Monday when the workers turning the gears of American capitalism from their cubicles had access to their work computers. Now since everyone carries around a smart phone, so the monday timing doesn't matter as much. But hey, I think we'll be able to really push Bitcoin Black Friday as a healthy alternative to rampant consumerism that infects the normal event.

Resubmit the offer, I'll remove your older one.
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:27:27
Even businesses that don't accept Bitcoin yet have been trying to get involved. 
Businesses are loving it, number of sales are growing! I'm excited to see the results at the end of the day.
(please ask on the actual thread for any follow up questions)

The biggest assumption that I read down towards the end is that magic cards have more utility than Bitcoin.
One of the intriguing things about Bitcoin is that it is both a currency and a payments network. That means that you can send bitcoins along the Bitcoin network anywhere in the world for fractions of a penny in fees. That is some goddamn utility right there.
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:41:40
It was more of a joke than anything.
We'll be able to get some real numbers from processors and merchants themselves. I think we're on track to do very well.
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:32:59
yay for disflation!

* Trades should usually not be advertised here. For example, submissions like "Buying 100 BTC" or "Selling my computer for bitcoins" do not belong here. is primarily for news and discussion.

Ripple is decentralized.
You can use Ripple without investing in XRP.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:34:08
If you're a good Bitcoin consumer, you'll tell all your favorite Bitcoin merchants to list a deal on the day of. It's free traffic for them, lower prices for you!

Do I believe that the immense tech talent in the Bitcoin community will come up with safer ways to transact online? Yes.
This is one of Bitcoin's problems. If you're a dev or an entrepreneur interested in working with Bitcoin, safeguarding consumers transacting with bitcoins is an unsexy, but extremely needed product.
