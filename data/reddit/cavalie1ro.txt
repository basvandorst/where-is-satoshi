True. And tries to say something like "government and banks are still more trustworthy than an unregulated value transfer system". Quite easy to refute:
- trust in banks vs trust in decentralized system: obvious choice (for us), MtGox problems show even more that trust in one particular entity can be broken easily
- commodity vs currency: I think Bitcoin has features/can be used as both, so no point in this observation;
- used mainly for speculation: not sure, but I think gold might be the same (larger quantity used for value/speculation rather than industry/jewelery), variations in price of gold are very high even though it's much more invested in than btc;the people of Ukraine 'speculate' when buying dollars/euros to avoid inflation.
- Charlie's arrest (or rather execution, see his podcast declarations) did not make any bitcoin dissapear, there was no instability for BitInstant clients;
- Mtgox did lose a lot of coins, shows about the same instability as (regulated) Enron or other such cases.
So no, the recent turmoil in the Bitcoin world actually proves more about Bitcoin's stability, in my opinion. And you still have the freedom to give it as much as you want of your trust and use other currencies/commodities as well.

Same here. I think title should be redacted, or the OP provide proof of the "following" emails in which Bitstamp admitted to the leak (with email headers)

If one is in a bad situation, might still find a laugh about it. This is obviously just a joke, I'm not playing with anyone.
