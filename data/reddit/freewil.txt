I'd probably take this over the current US tax code, wins for simplicity alone. Does this not unfairly harm savers more though, since in effect people living paycheck-to-paycheck (whether by choice or not) would not at all be taxed?

humans don't like change, the easier you can make it for someone the better. People should know they don't need to know anything about Bitcoin or how it works to start using it.
Both WalletBit and BitPay have nice solutions. "sign up here, use their API/add a checkout button, have the funds deposited directly to your bank account"

Why don't the Keynesians ever bring up "the wealth effect" when they talk about hoarding?. The claim is that deflation is deterimental because people won't spend money. They never make that same claim when the stock market or housing prices soar. They instead claim it to be a sign of how wonderful the economy is and how it is leading to a "wealth effect" where consumers increase their spending.

If you do a lot of international business then it could be a major competitive advantage to use Bitcoin. An international wire transfer from the US could easily cost $40. Now there are other alternatives such as PayPal, but it'd still be cheaper for the receiver to accept Bitcoin.
I haven't studied the adoption of credit cards, but it would be something worthwhile to look at it. I certainly think once merchants see the advantages of accepting Bitcoin (in-store or Internet) compared to credit cards they could be a major force. The typical credit card transaction will cost a merchant something like 2.9% + $0.25

Great interview overall, but I just don't think it's a good way to start out a conversation about Bitcoin. Maybe bringing it up afterwards as an example of how it is able to thwart censorship would be better?

I can't comment on their business success in terms of revenue, but Armory seems to have possibly found a working model for their wallet, similar to Red Hat, where their wallet is open-source, but they offer enterprise consulting.

Before FinCEN came out with their [guidance]( in March 2013, most entrepreneurs and experts looking at the issue assumed bitcoin exchanges would be considered either a money transmitter or a dealer in foreign exchange/currency exchanger (both specific types of money service businesses). 
If you look at the definition of currency in the regulations relating to the BSA and MSBs, it's clear that bitcoin would not fall underneath it because it would have to be the official currency of a government or country to be considered a "currency".
As it turns out, FinCEN ended up categorizing bitcoin (and virtual currencies, in general) under the more strictly regulated (on a state-by-state basis) money transmitter category.
To complicate matters further, just because something is considered money transmission at the federal level, it may not be so under a state's money transmission laws.

I am now the maintainer (thanks jb55 for the original creation) of the bitcoin node module linked here. So to be clear, node-libcoin is an implementation of the core components of a bitcoin client.
The module linked here is simply a small library that makes JSON-RPC calls to bitcoind (or another client implementing the same JSON-RPC).

Blockchain.info shows the technical data of blocks, transactions, inputs, and outputs. These are the nuts and bolts under the hood. Typically your client/wallet will have a much simplier interface that just has a list of transactions relevant to you, hides any change, and shows your balance.

"The Matrix is a system, Neo. That system is our enemy. But when you're inside, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, most of these people are not ready to be unplugged. And many of them are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to protect it."

Yes, bitcoin.org should really support SSL and have the non-SSL site do a 301 redirect. Otherwise a man-in-the-middle could intercept and modify the page contents and insert a phishing site link instead of sourceforge.

If all you want to do is make JSON-RPC calls with Node.js then it might make sense just to use node-bitcoin. In fact, it might make sense for node-libcoin to use node-bitcoin for doing the RPC calls.

I think if you are strictly looking at it from an engineering perspective, the coins are the individual pieces of data (like packets) that make up the network. So if you want to utilize the network then you will need to send packets across it.

I don't think the change address/output is all that confusing. This is normally handled by your client/wallet transparently and you don't even notice that the change output even exists. It seems you only got confused when you started looking at the technical data on blockchain.info without any basic background knowledge of what you were looking at or what a bitcoin transaction consists of.
I think a fair analogy would be if you got confused when you opened the hood of your car and noticed some wires, pipes, and mechanisms you weren't told about by the car salesman. So you called and told them to tell their engineers to simplify the car.

Not sure what the problem is. Sounds like Mt. Gox may be having an issue/bug with their document upload form. If the upload is failing, it's not like the documents are magically going to end up public on the Internet.

This doesn't even begin to address all the other very interesting capabilities of the technology involving different types of contracts. These are able to be implemented thanks to the simple scripting capabilities built into the protocol. 
One example is the ability to automatically transfer bitcoins to a heir on their 18th birthday.
