I got the assorted gift basket from them, it was great.

The temps are fine, 65C with 70% fan speed

My problem might be this and the fact that I have no idea who the people "I know" are.

I'm glad I got verified when the price of bitcoin was $60.

That is strange. Once I updated to the 13.2 drivers I immediately dropped 50Mhashs and thought it was a fluke or something.

Awesome, definitely going to order something soon

I ordered some of this last week before the 4th, should be getting here Saturday. I hope its really good.

I would have to agree. I ordered their large gift box and it is amazingly good. Plus I have stopped taking my allergy medicine and started eating a teaspoon of honey everyday with my morning cup of tea.

I ordered 3lbs of baklava from this guy, it is very delicious. I was unsure whether or not to get 1 or 3lbs, but if you plan on sharing it the 3lbs will go fast. The texture of the baklava was very good (the bottom layer was a little papery, not sure if this is normal for baklava) and was nice and moist. 
Also if you get a chance or have the money for it you should get some fudge from stateless sweets.

But couldn't one buy at $150 cause another "panic" and drive the price up?

I currently have the 13.1 drivers installed and get ~50MHash/s more than when I had the 13.2 beta drivers installed

Dude I've been gambling for a while and I'm up &gt;&gt;62 cents. Post your wallet address and I'll send you .01
@_date: 2013-08-24 05:35:25
Yeah, but I havent set that up yet.
@_date: 2013-08-24 18:18:26
Yes it went through. 
You can see that it was sent from 1ES...QLS, that was me. It was confirmed 99 times

As long as my GPU is fine it is not a problem. I was worried I would that it might be dying.

Even if he did they transferred all the funds to a new wallet.

GUIMiner and a 7950. It has been a while since I was last mining and I remember having artifacts on screen when I was using 5770s but they weren't nearly as bad.
