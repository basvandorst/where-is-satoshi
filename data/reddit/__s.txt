Putting difficulty to 1, it takes 96 KH/s to make 1BTC/hour. Difficulty 2 makes 0.5BTC/hr. Diff 3 0.333BTC/hr. Diff 4 0.25 BTC/hr. So it seems it is 1/diff, only scaled somewhat

A recent block: 
There are 18 leading zeroes. Any given hash has a Math.pow(1/16, 18) chance of having 18 leading zeroes. 2.117582368135751e-22
That block rewarded 12.5 BTC
Full disclosure: I'm working this stuff out off the cuff, I'm a btc newb. But from this we can surmise difficulty can dial a couple knobs: block reward &amp; zero count. Not sure how halvening works, probably dials the other knob
&amp; whoopdeedoo it seems leading zeroes isn't the success metric: [source](

The amount of effort it took to be able to buy bitcoin proves its value to me. Bank takes a week to transfer securely, has 30$ transaction fee, meanwhile bitcoin works online, modest fee, same day transaction. Best way to buy crypto online is crypto

gz. Was lined up to be there with you, but Canadian wire times (5-12 days rather than 1-5 days) had my wire take all the way until last Friday evening to transfer over a week later..

I was saying the probability is 1 divided by 16 raised to the number of leading zeroes in the desired hash

What if someone secretly had a quantum computer which then allowed them to construct a longer blockchain than our current blockchain, breaking away from the genesis block? Obviously there's probably way more profitable things to invest such a large amount of quantum computation time on than overthrowing bitcoin

Trying to get a coworker to not burn his cash into B3 scam, but he thinks it's so cool to have coins be worth pennies. Doesn't get that 500 in BTC costs the same as 500 in shit, only difference is that shit grows shit

Saying you only need to attack one is like saying if I go out &amp; create an implementation &amp; it works on the network &amp; I'm the only one using it, I can now attack the network as a whole by attacking my own usage of this new implementation just as much as I could attack the network as a whole by attacking bitcoin core

If everybody starts selling it becomes a buyer's market. So buyer's start paying less because instead of paying you @ 4750$ they'll pay someone else @ 4700$. This continues as the price goes down. Now they may be stuck with btc @ 4000$ or people will see the low price &amp; start buying &amp; some will sell @ 4100$ until the lowest seller is @ 5000$. Now the ones who bought @ 4700$ decide to sell @ 5000$ until buyer's start finding those willing @ 4900$ &amp; onwards we go

I'll concede that you're pov makes sense when you have the belief that Core should stabilize into an immutable codebase &amp; that code is spec. I'll never believe spec as code is acceptable design, so that's the point on which we cannot reach consensus

The problem with alternative implementations is when there's only a few. Then you lose out on the benefits of coincidental consensus more than you gain diversity. Bitcoin's mindpool should be large enough to diversify at this point
As an aside the questions period was really dumb where people were accusing the guy of irresponsible disclosure. What's the point of making a conference "Breaking Bitcoin". The point of bitcoin is that any individual actor shouldn't have the ability to cause an issue, if they can, that's the protocol's problem, anybody else could do what this guy is bringing up. Project Zero gives less time than he seems to've given Core

This is why you standardize consensus on a specified protocol. Otherwise it's a shit protocol. Torrents are better for the diversity of clients not being taken when uTorrent sold out. The web is better for not being stuck on IE6
Your argument eventually arrives to never updating software ever, because if we stick to implementation defined behavior it becomes a wild mess nobody can untangle
Also thanks for ignoring my point &amp; just repeating yourself

If there's a 1000 cracks then you need to mount that many more attacks compared to if there were only a handful of cracks. The point of decentralization is fault tolerance

laszlo doesn't regret the 10k. He amassed much btc from first mover advantage on gpu mining, &amp; the choice is part of what grew btc

According to banks, BTC is a shitcoin
