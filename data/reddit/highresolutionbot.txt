How is Lightning a wreck?
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:10:50
That's ridiculous. That's like saying the internet will never scale because users are limited by 56k modems. 99.9% of all Bitcoin transactions have been cheap and nearly instantaneous, don't let the past couple of weeks influence your decision. If you think any other altcoin can scale to Bitcoin's user base and not run into problems you're severely misinformed. 
Lightning is the next phase of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

Yes, let's all post on our mains about how we own Bitcoin on exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-09-21 21:00:34
Aaaaand it's gone.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:21:10
You're wasting everybody's time here. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:29:51
Explain please. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:19:40
Great counterargument. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:42:08


Lol, the irony.

Let me guess, you're a bcash shill.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:49:03
I'd love to have that crystal ball you have there. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 04:25:28
Nothing phases me any more. This will probably be followed by even another dump down to $3k

Mining/Buying Bitcoin in the early years is not associated with a high IQ

BitPay can suck it.

This is separate from the Microsoft/Starbucks announcement they made a long time ago. So in essence, nothing has really changed and certainly nothing to be excited about here.

Divide the seed phrase among several different safe deposit boxes. Likelihood of it being stolen or lost are almost zero.

This news is several months old

Bullrun has officially begun.

Tried paying with Lightning, but it keeps failing. Using Eclair.

They don't promote any coins. If you have pre-fork Bitcoins, the wallet makes it easy to pull your Bitcoin Cash coins (or any other forked coin) and do whatever you'd like with them (sell them if you hate BCash).
@_date: 2018-11-08 21:16:03
Well I tried 10 times. I give up

Fiat currency is inflationary, bitcoin is deflationary.

Seeing this stuff fills me with huge regret. If only I had invested earlier. 
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:07:07
Makes me cringe every time. Like, that's all they can do. They can't contribute to XRP source code because...centralization. So they resort to these things.

Are you aware of any how-to guides online for integrating BTCPay/LN into an existing app? I have limited programming experience
