Hello, quick question for you!
From the article:






This code results in the key varying based on the runtime of sha256, which seems to invalidate the main premise.
What did I miss?

@_date: 2015-06-22 12:42:46
How does that help?
Wouldn't that still have a different runtime on each system, when the whole point is synchronization?

I understand now, thank you for clarifying. I am still working on learning and I appreciate your patience. I will get there!


Awesome, that sounds like a good time. Is there a reference implementation in some other language, or any document that's a little more clear than the whitepaper available?
Could a single implementation be used for both open assets and bitcoins? Do you want to create some type of p2p network, or will each library be a centralized facilitator?
I'm still focused on understanding bitcoin scripts and constructing transactions from the templates for now, but I always like to look ahead!

They aren't going to sell the coins right now, it's a bluff.
The government could sell now and make a few million of the same currency that **they can already print**, or they could hold them as an insurance policy in case bitcoin actually starts gaining traction and begins absorbing wealth from around the world.
It would be really stupid for them to sell right now and I don't think they are stupid. But we'll see.

Nodes enforce the rules against the miners. It's like a check and balance system.
If there were no nodes, nothing would stop the miners from colluding to give themselves 1000 coins per block (for example).
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:23:49
That was a really good response.
The main difference between coining my own currency and creating a virtual currency is that the latter can actually *do something of value*. In that case, the token is not so much a currency but more of a commodity.
If you go about restricting the on-ramps of funding for these novel new commodities then the innovation will be pushed elsewhere.
Furthermore, I have yet to see any evidence that these money laundering laws actually work (HSBC). So the proposal of stifling this enormously exciting new industry, in the hopes of preventing something that's not even being prevented right now, is upsetting and counterproductive.
If regulators really cared about money laundering, they would focus on the off-ramps from the network not the on-ramps.

Yes, I realize there are other proposed solutions (there is PoS as well and a hybrid of both), but PoW is the one that has thus far properly proven itself for this use case.
My understanding of validator voting depends on people selecting "reputable validators" and ensuring that everyone has adequate overlap which brings with it a whole different set of problems - namely reputation and trust.
There are many people who claim they have figured out better solutions than PoW but they all have trade offs. The fact remains that our current method has been working quite well and there is absolutely no reason to risk switching to something else unproven.
There are no signs that carbon emission is an issue with bitcoin right now, and things should only improve as efficiency increases.

As long as they can't naked short it, then it doesn't matter because there are only so many bitcoins available to borrow.
With other assets like gold and silver they can do this because nobody knows where all those bars of gold really are. But with bitcoin, its 100% transparent and you can inventory it.

* "Regardless of how you feel about the law, it's still the law"

You can often get a lot of information by listening to what *isn't* talked about. What strikes me after watching all the hearings and reading all the guidance, is how little the U.S. government cares about finding Satoshi.
I feel like if this was anything else, there would be forces at work unmasking the creator, shaming them, discrediting them, etc. 
Satoshi is seemingly being protected by higher forces. Either they found him, and he sold out, or they were him all along.
Of course these are just my humble observations and opinion.

?? Cryptic.


That's great. As long as the p2p network is healthy and they don't 51% attack, they are only adding security and helping the network.
People don't 51% attack because for that to succeed it means destroying the value of the protocol, their own coins, and their expensive mining hardware.
BTW this is all discussed in the Bitcoin whitepaper. Have you even read the whitepaper? You really should, it's interesting and short. It would also help you better form your "criticisms" in ways that aren't taken as trolling.


Damn, you really just linked me to 100 page dense PDF just to tell me what the average price of a mW is? So you've been having trouble with people mistaking you for a troll, eh?
Did you even bother to find out how many mW are used a day to mine?
No? Is that because it would involve knowing the average power consumption per hash of mining hardware, and the current hash rate and that's just way too much work for trollbait?
Anyway, your entire premise is flawed because bitcoin doesn't create carbon, the power sources create carbon.
It's like all we have to do is just start mining with solar panels and people like you would call bitcoin green and environmentally friendly.
Alright that's enough. I have a bad habit of feeding you creatures.

Yeah, logic is hard. Conflating assertions and arguments for instance. Let's check our trusty dictionary:








Now here's the definition of an assertion:








Do you see the difference? It's subtle. The *argument* includes *reasons* or even better - a *set of reasons* along with and idea.
So for instance my claim that "mr_dick_doge never passed the 5th grade" is an *assertion* not an *argument* and therefore there is nothing to refute.
Now if I said that "Based on his incorrect usage of words as demonstrated in the post above, it is likely mr_dick_doge lacks a higher education"
That would be an argument. Do you understand?

That incentive model doesn't work.
The average individual does not hold enough bitcoins to worry about systemic protocol risk, and running a node provides no other form of compensation.
If the only people running nodes are the people with big investment incentives, you are looking at mostly miners or big firms. That is where centralization comes from.

I think if you made an account and tried using the anark.re system, you would see why. The short answer is that it's just *easier* for the user.
Current multi-sig implementations are not user friendly and consequently not accessible to the general bitcoin user.
Most people do not know (or want to know) how to find their uncompressed public key, or how to read and understand the transaction. It is also difficult to hide this stuff from the user without breaking support for local wallets.
With our method, the user just has to remember their password and be able to import a bitcoin private key. The whole process is very streamlined and there's no way to screw it up.
I am, however, watching development of multi-sig very closely and if I can find a way to make it as user friendly as our current system I will definitely implement it.
@_date: 2014-11-16 18:21:18
One of the main points of bitcoin's design that goes all the way back to the original white paper is support for thin clients (spv).
Since the bitcoin miners and full nodes validate the source of every bitcoin all the way back to its origin in an unbreakable chain of hash trees (Merkel trees), it allows thin clients like cellphones to validate transactions without needing to download the entire blockchain.
They can just look at a single hash per block (Merkel root) and be sure that the coins they receive are legit without needing the whole blockchain to look at every transaction. 
The problem is that the nodes and miners do not check the integrity or source of any other data that might be hidden within blocks.
So you can totally build anything you want on top of the bitcoin chain, but everyone who uses it must have the entire blockchain and the resources to download and parse it constantly since the Merkel roots only apply to bitcoins, not the custom  protocol.

* Tiny hardware keyloggers with transmitters built into the hardware
The NSA is so far ahead of us, it's ridiculous. The only thing I've ever seen that might actually withstand an NSA attack would be the Trezor.

Which machine is that? How secure is it? If it's so secure, why not just keep your bitcoins there and avoid the entire scanning step?


Do you have a grudge against magnets? Does it really matter what media it's on if its BIP38 encrypted?


Yes it is. You are relying on BIP38 to protect your key, not the paper itself. If you spend it from a compromised host, you are toast.


So do you have some type of elaborate OCR system to scan in private keys, and print out new paper wallets for each transaction? If so, that would be quite interesting.


Just like BIP38, except your implementation is vulnerable when you go to spend.
With the Trezor you just need to protect/encrypt/backup 1 piece of data and you get a secure spending device that can function anywhere and cannot be lost, stolen, or destroyed.

I think bitshares is amazingly cool. 
A fully transparent derivative market which takes people gambling against each other, and commoditizes their bets into tradable units - I can think of endless possibilities.
I only wonder how fragile the whole system is. Can it really stand up to major well funded entities attempting to manipulate it if it gets really big?
What happens if the value of bets represented exceeds the cost to acquire voting shares? Could this create an economic incentive that may result in compromising delegates long term?
At least with bitcoin, we can be reasonably sure that its PoW will scale to protect its value and there are no other hidden properties that might skew incentives.

Trying to peg the price of bitcoin to mining costs is a fools errand. Mining costs follow the price and not vice versa.
@_date: 2014-04-28 23:20:24


Major logic flaw here.
As nodes become more resource intensive to run (they will be running full fledged scripts soon) the level of "vested interest" tradeoff for each individual slowly tapers down until only the wealthiest bitcoin holders have the financial interest to run full nodes.
If the bitcoin network consolidates so that the miners also run most of the nodes, then the bitcoin protocol can be changed.
This is a serious problem. Please do not downplay it. It is essential for the future of crytpocurrency that someone figures out how to compensate nodes for their work in validation, relaying, and storage.

The problem is that every address is generated sequentially from the seed, meaning there are infinite addresses and the only way to find then is by going through them one by one.
If you make 1000 addresses, but only fund the last one, how many addresses should your wallet software check to find your money?
Right now I think most wallets just stop looking when it finds an unused address.
I guess the solution is just to try and use your accounts and addresses sequentially.

This is pretty epic ownage, but yet it's sad in a way.
As someone who used the original Robocoin machine when it was first introduced in San Jose, I remember its design was firmly rooted in the bitcoin culture. It was a simple 3 step process, no identification crap. It was reliable and feature rich. But that was before Jordan Kelly.
The main engineer John Russell did a great job and was never interested in all the extra verification crap, but sadly there are business pressures around a company that can make it move in this direction.
If this open source software can mimic the same functionality and run on the machines hardware with only a cheap modification, Robocoin will have to dramatically rethink its business strategy.
There will also be other ATMs out there that will be able to perform these same functions. Many of them won't be encumbered by excessive regulations. Making them cheaper, more reliable, and more desirable in general.
I hope Robocoin can find some middle ground to profit off their technically superior product, while at the same time staying true to the core concepts of bitcoin.

I don't doubt that financial regulators see anti-money laundering tools as essential for crime fighting, just as I'm sure the NSA believes they need to be spying on the whole world to protect us.
The problem with both these ideas is that they fail to address what is being traded for this false sense of security.
The current restrictive state of our financial system has resulted in more than half of the world's adult population being unbanked. That is a tremendous amount of potential economic output that is being excluded from the global economy, simply because lawmakers think they need to tightly control the flow of money.
Illegal traffickers can be caught without controlling everyone's money, just as criminals can be investigated without destroying all of our privacy.


Firstly, one example of mediocre enforcement does not indicate policy effectiveness. Do you *honestly* believe money laundering laws have helped reduce any sort of illicit trade?
Secondly, you call some fines and resignations "a good outcome", while Charlie Shrem went to jail and is being charged with multiple felonies for doing much less?
This speaks to the hypocrisy inherent in selective enforcement, and how these regulations are abused to serve the top 1%.


What about Mike Caldwell who had to [shut down his business]( of selling physical bitcoins because it's clearly such a dangerous, society damaging activity?


Why is this any different from selling virtual currency in a video game, or gold, or expensive art?
The problem with your outlook is that *anything* can be viewed as a currency, and by declaring something a currency it then gives regulators the authority to prohibit its sale through the issuance of MSB licenses.
This is incredibly dangerous to the future global online economy. When you consider all the applications that give these tokens value outside of their exchange rate, it seems ludicrous to restrict their legal sale.

Well, cryptard, there's a difference between implementation code, and features themselves.
95% of the code may have changed, but the underlying feature set has remained.
The consensus is that transaction fees need to be transparent to allow transaction value to float on the free market. Not that fees are going away, or that miners won't mine after the block reward.
If you want a real bitcoin criticism, I'll give you one: Fees do not actually support the storage or validation of the blockchain.
The full nodes who must store the entire blockchain and validate the signatures of each transaction are essential for bitcoin's security, yet are not compensated for their labor. Therefore, running these services for bitcoin is currently a charity.
Bitcoin tries to plug this hole by limiting the computational complexity of transactions and the size of the blockchain. This is why devs cut OP_RETURN from 80 to 40 bytes in March.
It's also why bitcoin isn't trying to do things that other platforms (ethereum and counterparty) are trying, even though similar code has previously existed in bitcoin.
Neither of these new groups have figured out a way to directly compensate the users who actually do the work of processing and storing their complicated scripts.
That is the real economic hole in blockchain tech right now. Not the block reward ending.

How can you use cost of production as a lower limit, when the cost of production is always relative to other miners who all react to the price?

Zero confirm transactions are technically *more confirmed* than your credit card transaction as in there is less risk of that money getting taken back. They are usually close to instant, but can sometimes take a while.
That problem has already been solved though. Using the Payment Protocol your transaction is sent directly to the merchant. If you use Bitpay, transactions are faster than most credit card terminals for both parties with no risk of chargeback. (and it's free!)
It is also more secure, since the identity of the person you are paying is cryptographically verified.
This technology is superior in every way.
Don't forget, bitcoins can go places your credit cards can never go. Try buying something from Iran with your credit card, for instance.

It's more about the *severity* of the cases. Law enforcement could catch a thousand Charlie Shrem's and still not come close to what HSBC did. There is a massive disparity in enforcement action if you consider the "harm to society" that these crimes supposedly cause.


This view really shocks me because it is actually the opposite of how you should feel if you really cared about the harm to society. You would want to spend more effort investigating and prosecuting the smarter (bigger) criminals instead of picking off the smaller low hanging fruit.
This hypocritical enforcement strategy strongly implies motives other protecting society.
Since nobody in the HSBC case went to jail or was held personally liable, what is disincentivising those people from finding new creative ways to carry on the same activities? If what they did was so bad, why are they being allowed to walk free?


There's the insanity: The belief that anything that could be used for money laundering needs to be regulated. That belief is a) impossible to enforce uniformly, b) leads to hypocritical enforcement, and c) doesn't help society.
The fact that a man cannot even sell a physical bitcoin speaks to the massive undue burden on economic activity all in the name of this nebulous threat of money laundering.
Like I said before, anything can be used to launder money. It's incredibly easy. If you really believe that you were stopping any illicit trade then why is the drug trade still going strong? Why have these laws not eradicated the other harmful illicit trades that we all dislike?
You might want to consider that there may be other more political motivations for intrusive money laws that are overly broad, arbitrarily enforced, and unduly restrict economic activity.

You're right, there needs to be enough nodes to support the SPV clients, but that's not the only purpose of a full node.
Nodes protect against consolidation.
If we ever get to the point where the miners are the only ones running nodes, the network is officially compromised.
Furthermore, it's nearly impossible to tell if/when this has happened.
Someone looking to control the network would *want* to ensure all SPV clients are happy and move everyone over to SPV because this gives them more power.
Just because all the SPV clients are working does not mean there are enough nodes (or more importantly, *diverse* nodes)

There hasn't been interest on checking accounts for so long now that I forgot there was once an extremely low rate.
It still never satisfied the definition for a ponzi scheme though, because the rate was never high, and payouts did not come from other depositors, and it was never marketed as an investment.
The details here matter. Even if there was a high return and it was marketed as an investment, it still doesn't mean it's a ponzi.
You could loan me $50k which I could use to open up a profitable storefront and repay you $75k a year later which is a high return, but not a ponzi. Even if I lost $50k and failed to repay you, it still wouldn't be a ponzi.

There is no arbitrary profit margin that describes a money transmitter. Fincen guidance says MSB rules apply to any exchanger *in the business* of selling bitcoins.

I've been reading up on the open asset protocol and was hoping you could answer a couple questions.
You say in the protocol specification:


This makes it sound like the contract can be changed at any time by the issuer. However, in the blog post you say:


Where the RicardianContract is an asset definition file which contains a hash of the human readable contract. This is then used to derive the ScriptPubKey which is used to derive the AssetId. So doesn't that mean that the contract terms can't be changed without changing the AssetId? Why would this not be enough to hold up in court, assuming that the issuer is validated?
Is there any way to create a self enforcing contract? For instance, a contract where proving ownership of X tokens allows you to spend 0.X% of all inputs to a predefined address? Could such a scheme ever be possible?
I have begun slowly working my way through the NBitcoin codebase and am beginning to understand how all the big moving parts work. Eventually, I hope I might be able to make some contributions - are there any particular areas I should focus on studying, or any features you may need help with?

Not yet, but it will be. Mobile bitcoin clients can already send payments to sellers on the spot just like Google Wallet. So it's already mimicking the ease and convince of a prominent emerging technology.
Give it a little longer, you will see it become more and more attractive to buyers and sellers alike.


Eh? If you think hopping on TOR or a VPN before sending a payment is "significant additional technological use".
Even if you don't, it is still very difficult to find a real-life identity from a bitcoin address. Just because something is *possible* does not make it completely *feasible*.

This doesn't make anything "more difficult", it actually just makes it easier. It becomes pure value assessment. If the spammer can make more money by breaking the captcha than it costs to break, he will do it.
This method actually simplifies things for the spammer because there is no technological challenge involved and it will work 100% of the time. Captcha is supposed to prove someone is *human*, not that they have money.
You might claim 1/10th of a cent is too little money, but how do you know? It completely depends on the value of what's being protected. What makes you think raising that to 1/5th of a cent will help?
And at the end of the day you are still asking your users to *pay* for simple form submissions instead of typing in some letters. When a site has a hundred thousand users, and they need to perform human checks regularly these "trivial" amounts can become nontrivial quickly.

Don't you think this would be making life much more difficult for your thousands of legitimate users?
Stopping website automation is a very difficult problem, and money is not the answer because:
1. If the protected resource can be monetized for greater than the cost of solving the captcha - you are still 100% vulnerable to spammers.
2. You are alienating customers who are poor, don't have bitcoins, or just don't see paying as worth the effort.
The future of captcha can't be a pay per action model. It will move in the direction of more advanced turing tests. Recognizing 3D objects within shadows would be a good next step. Or some type of captcha that requires interactive input that is not easily farm-able.

If bitcoin becomes a major payment method, not only would it become an undue burden to get the identities of every customer (imagine if they enacted that law for cash), it would still be completely unenforceable and likely ignored.

If they are going to do this, it has to happen soon. Entrepreneurs are are building their businesses and infrastructure around it. Money and time is being invested. Buyers and sellers are slowly coming to understand the technology and we can see this in the price and stability of bitcoins.

1. Besides being a blockchain explorer, blockchain.info also runs an online wallet service that can send and receive payments without running the bitcoin client.
2. The posted information came from blockchain.info's user database that holds information about its users. It is not public information. You cannot go look it up on their website.
3. Accessing the DOM of your browser allows you to see the objects and code that make up the page you are viewing. It does not give you access to data inside a server's database. It does not allow you to access other people's data.

1. Unlike bitcoin transactions, paid captcha solving does not have 100% success rate because humans are fallible and services do have downtime.
2. This "solution" fundamentally destroys the meaning of captcha - the goal of which is to prove you are human. Sending bitcoins does NOT prove you are human. Solving captchas such as re-captcha also help machine learning projects and book digitizing efforts.
3. Upping the dollar value of the form submit (the captcha target) only makes sense if you know the value of your protected resource is only slightly below current captcha solving market value. If spammers are willing to pay 1/10th of a cent now, how much do you need to increase it to stop spammers while not alienating customers?
@_date: 2012-10-25 22:04:34


That is exactly the way I am talking about. They can *tell* you to report your Bitcoin transactions, but they have no way of enforcing or verifying their accuracy. You can't rely only on manual audits to enforce a policy like that.
How many companies and individuals hide assets offshore? Do you really think bitcoins are harder to hide that offshore assets?
Also keep in mind that the more of the economy that moves into bitcoin the harder it will be to audit.
Imagine a company that pays all wages and expenses in bitcoin, sells only in bitcoin, and has no debt. How do you audit this person? How do you verify their books are correct?

It a piece of software. Coded by *human beings*.
How many iterations does software go through before it becomes perfect? Are you aware at how many crashes and outages happen to web services when they try to scale? 
And the fact that this is open source means it is vulnerable to fragmentation. The software could fork. The blockchain could split. Think about how many versions of Linux there are.
There's only one blockchain. There are no do overs if it gets destroyed, Bitcoin value drops to zero.
And that's not even considering that the law could come down on it hard, banishing it from mainstream use.
Bitcoin is amazing, but there are still reasons to be weary. It needs to prove itself a little longer before you can start claiming it will take over the world.

You are the one trying to change the protocol.
The protocol as designed by Satoshi was for a new address for every single send and receive. That's how the math works best.
Originally he expected people to send money to IP addresses and the address would be generated behind the scenes so this issue would never have occurred.
People were never supposed to get attached to their bitcoin addresses like this. It is undermining a large aspect of bitcoin's security and could be disastrous long term.

I guess I'm just not very content with SSL being vulnerable to "high value targets". Maybe I see these high value targets as being more frequent than you do? For instance, I am sure they could MITM whole regions in certain parts of the world with very little fear of discovery. 
You're right, however, that for the purpose of signing payment requests I suppose there's really nothing wrong with using RSA certificates.
The trust issue with the CAs is very much separate, and I don't think it's *useless*, just a bit too vulnerable. You point out that I am in control of my own trusted certs. While this is true, I have no basis for determining which ones to trust or distrust. Currently this trust is dictated by the browser and the OS in a very opaque fashion that users are not a part of.
Cert transparency will allow everyone to see what the CA is signing, but there will still needs to be some way for the end user to aggregate this information and use it. Otherwise, what's the point? Maybe this will happen once the information is available?
I always appreciate your thoughts on these matters, thanks for the discussion.

Things you seem to be missing:
1. The treasuries are not really sold on a free or open market - their price is manipulated. The banks buying the bonds will *always* be able to make the purchase at the desired price because they will just sell them to the FED which has free money. That means the price is total bullshit.
2. When the government pays back its debt + interest, it does so from *taxes*. That means the people are paying tax on something that should be free. Did it cost anything for the FED to create that free money? Why does it get to profit from something that costs nothing?
There are many errors with your list of "corrections" at the top, I am disappointed to see it get so many upvotes.

No, they can't. There is a minimum on credit card purchases. If the purchase is too small, the vendor actually loses money.
And there is a guarantee that bitcoin fees will remain low - the mining system is a free market democracy. If a miner tries to charge too much, someone else will just process the transaction instead.

It is likely that *most* of all traffic going to mining.bitcoin.cz under their network is from botnets/trojans.

I tend to think we need to pick a conservative arbitrary blocksize limit that balances the need for processing/mining fairness across the globe with the general expected number of daily transactions.
Realistically, there is no need to have uncapped blocksizes because daily transaction demand is not infinite.
Independent and distributed mining power is important because it keeps the network honest.
This honesty is paid for by the users via transaction fees.

Captcha is not broken, it has just turned into a business where people farm out the solutions for pennies.
ReCaptcha is a good example. They are able to see when machines start catching up and change their warping accordingly.
Other types of captcha are even more effective, like object recognition within scenes with varying/random lighting.

Summary of bitcoin points:
1. Bitcoin is not scale-able. Processing and storage requirements will outpace technology and result in a specialized bitcoin network, i.e. "banks".
2. It's possible to store any kind of data in the blockchain, but it costs btc.
3. When using TOR with bitcoin, outside probes can still discover you're running the client.

Shorting an equivalent mining contract while mining yourself in a selfish pool means that your net profit is in BTC for only the difference between honest and selfish mining.
It sounds like what you really want is to go long on a selfish miner contract while shorting an honest miner contract, both in USD.

Lot's of nice big misdirections in this article to keep you from missing the the fat 6% hole that enriches the banking elite for free. See how it says:


The major oversight here is that American Express issues checks for dollars, while the FED issues dollars for *treasuries* which is essentially the debt of the American tax payer.
Even worse, the bond's future value is nominally more than the amount of dollars created. This means the system has to continue expanding indefinitely until collapse since there will never be enough dollars to pay back the debt + interest.
See quote from here: 


The FED makes 6% on this massive scam.
Ask yourself: WHY do Americans have to pay a 3rd party 6% to issue their *own money*?  It's clearly wrong, it doesn't make any sense, and nobody properly discloses it or educates the public.


This was poorly made with many factual errors. Not what I would recommend.


This is where you're going wrong. Wages and salary are supposed to increase along with inflation - but in reality it doesn't. Official inflation numbers are a massive joke. They conveniently leave out exactly the sectors where most of the inflation *actually goes*, like fuel, food, and healthcare.


Indeed, it increases velocity and encourages debt. These aren't good things when they are being done artificially. Forcing people to move their money around constantly is forcing people to play a losing game that they can't win.
Either you have to:
1. Put your money in the stock market where you are giving it to the irresponsible banks and financial organizations
2. Keep your money in dollars while their value is stolen and spent elsewhere
3. Go into debt and live your life as a slave always paying more in interest and never owning anything to get the "benefits" of inflation
Our whole economy is designed to enrich the financial sector and keep the population working while entrenched in debt.

No, it's not real insurance.
The FDIC was put into place to prevent bank runs. Nobody pays into it like they do with insurance. Rather, if the bank can't cover your deposits for whatever reason the federal reserve will print dollars to replace that cash.

A blocksize is a limit on how many transactions can be recorded in a block. A block is generated approximately every 10 minutes and serves to verify and timestamp all transactions that happened during that time period.
Limiting the blocksize means that as transaction volume increases, users will have to pay higher fees to have their transaction included in the block (since miners will only want to process the transactions with the higest fees). This leads to slower and more expensive transactions. But it keeps the mining network more spread out, decentralized, and "fair".
Uncapping the blocksize keeps the fees lower, but leads to centralization because larger blocks take more bandwidth and hashing power. This pushes smaller miners out of business that can't keep up, but allows for faster and cheaper transactions.

Doesn't matter if it's a bubble.
If there is no bad news to knock it down, it is possible (and likely) that the real value of Bitcoin will grow into its usd conversion price.
Imagine an internet where bitcoin integration was widespread. You could trade coins with friends, play games with coins, and buy stuff with the same coins. You could even send them to your phone and go buy groceries with them when POS systems start coming around.
Bitcoin has a seemingly bright future barring any sudden catastrophe.

You "can" accept a high value transaction too. It's all about your own person risk level. And maybe right now it doesn't seem like anyone would go through the effort to doublespend, but this could change.
I think the Race Attack could eventually become popular.
With a little effort you can submit a transaction directly to the vendor's client (or his surrounding nodes) and submit a different transaction directly to the miners. This gives you a chance of double spending your coins when the miners submit their next block. And if you *are* the miner you have a much better chance of pulling this off.
Malicious users could refine this process and use it every time they buy from a 0-confirm location, increasing their odds of getting free shit over time.

Bigger block sizes also increase the barrier of entry for miners and encourage miner centralization.
If the blocksize was 1GB, very few nodes worldwide would be able to download and verify the block before the next block is found. The security of the network gets pushed closer to the rich and away from the poor.
The miners incentive would be to pick a block size that is small enough to be processed by *only* 51% of the nodes, but big enough to prevent the other 49% from accepting it, thereby consolidating the mining industry over time.

No. Bitcoin is inherently valuable. Using Bitcoin, you are able to transmit credits anywhere in the world quickly, privately, irrevocably, and cheaply.
Those properties are what gives Bitcoin value.
And since nothing with those properties has ever existed before, the real value of BTC is the value of all the possible future technologies that can be built on top the Bitcoin platform.

Absolutely not. The government isn't interested on sitting on a pile of hard assets.

When bitcoin gets bigger and deflation slows, you would still feel the same impulse to cash out your gains it would just take longer.


Exactly! This is a good thing. It means you don't have to do irresponsible things with your money and instead have the freedom to use it when you please.


Just as raises are pegged to inflation, they can also be pegged to deflation. This is a non-issue.

That would be revealing too much information to would-be attackers who would easily be able to test their IP addresses.
Also, the fraud scoring systems are rarely black or white, but a combination of many factors.

The only reason gold doesn't work (and likely never will) is because you cannot inventory it. 
There is no way to tell who has what, and there is too much "paper" gold mixed into the system.
Effectively, gold is not a sound money because it can be counterfeited with operations like naked shorting the ETF. For gold to work, it needs to become decoupled from the paper market.
Since nobody really want's to deal with all that physical gold, it is unlikely gold will ever regain its role as sound money.

Do you even understand *why* we went off the gold standard? It sounds like you are just parroting talking points.
The irrefutable reason for leaving the gold standard was so that USA could begin to deficit spend to fund war. Or rather, begin to steal value from everyone holding USD. Couple that with the spread of USD as the world reserve currency and you get the main source of our nation's wealth.
And yes, it actually *is* a conspiracy to steal money, not just from me, but from the entire world.

You're wrong. You've already been proven wrong by Bitpay which has commented that spending increases as the price of bitcoin rises.


People will still spend on non-essentials, and here's why:
When you have money that appreciates in value, it's very much like getting "free money". Psychologically, this encourages people to spend, since they can now afford more than they could before.
Anyone who actually uses bitcoin has felt this and understands it. Additionally, all the sales data backs it up.
The idea that we all need to be "encouraged" to spend by having someone steal from us is a bold, outright lie.

"Money must be a unit of account!" - Using a quaint little axiom to prove something is or isn't money amounts to nothing more than a childish tantrum of ignorance.
Bitcoin is being used as money. Therefore, it's money.
If you thought that money had to be non-volatile, well... looks like you were wrong. Liquid markets allow contracts to be pegged in anything. Oops!
Furthermore, value is always relative. Once more of the supply chain starts using bitcoin, they will begin to take on value relative to other markets. This will make them more useful as a unit of account, so the situation is even temporary.

I agree with your view, but it is very idealistic. We still need to have a healthy respect and fear of the media right now.
It's all about public opinion. If bitcoin were successfully demonized in America, bad things could happen. It could be made illegal, they could use it to push for more internet restrictions and monitoring.
Sure bitcoin would persist, but it would really hurt us. It would hurt adoption and growth. Look how long its taken us to recover from the lies the government told about marijuana and the drug war. Propaganda is a powerful weapon.
I would prefer to sneak up on them. Build up the bitcoin ecosystem slowly with reputable businesses, so its harder to attack. The drugs and piracy will always be there, but lets not focus on them just yet.
It is inevitable that bitcoin will get attacked brutally by the entire establishment. After all, it is striking at the heart of the entire global power system. If by that time, Bitcoin has enough legitimate and popular uses it is going to be much more difficult to subvert.

Totally agree with your analysis about the vendors causing a net-sell effect. I also think that removing $3+million from the circulating supply couldn't have hurt.


It's not Baidu specifically, it's how the Chinese seem to have embraced it. Their exchange is doing well, and they are the leaders in btc mining technology. It makes sense for them to want to get in on this.
It may have some profound long term effects on their exchange rates, and it's still not clear whether these would be desirable to China or not.
In my opinion, bitcoin adoption would only benefit China. It appears, at least so far, they are seeing it the same way.

The hacker doesn't need to infect a browser. They can control your entire session via the HTTP stream in the background. This is not exactly new or groundbreaking.

I'm a huge fan of your work and presentations, but I don't think you are being fair with regards to SSL criticism.
Maybe the NSA was worried about ssl once upon a time, but now a days it's pretty hard to imagine they don't have access to a trusted CA. 
With everything bitcoin taught us about decentralization it's disappointing to see it capitulate to an established centralized trust system.
I mean if Iran can get a trusted signing key, I'm sure there are many other entities that can too.
I have heard you talk about transparent certificate signing which sounds like a great improvement , but it still doesn't seem to eliminate centralized trust. To fix ssl there has to be some way for the client to make it's own decisions about which CAs to trust based off solid public information, instead of having it dictated to us.

I completely agree. I hope Mega does really well and I hope Bitcoin does really well, but I'm just being realistic.
Weve even got tons of people on reddit talking about how bad Mega is, how Dotcom is a criminal, how the whole site is a scam, how it's all about piracy, blah blah.
It's just about perception right now.
I would rather have Bitcoin be a little more established with reputable companies first, so that when it DOES get hit with attention it will be harder to dismiss it as a currency for crooks and druggies.

Don't let anyone tell you that arguing on reddit won't do jack squat. I've learned quite a lot from your posts.

The reason they do this is that when somebody phishes/steals a bank account, nowadays the first thing they try to do is move all the money to a bitcoin exchange to cash it out.  
  
So they started flagging this behavior as potential fraud.. After they verify its you, it should okay.

You think the world is the same now as in 2008?
The FED wasn't creating 80 billion a month before 2008.
Do you not understand the basic concept that the FED's power to expand is absolute and infinite, while their power to contract is limited and finite?
Or do you really believe they can just sell back that many bonds to the rest of the world without a catastrophic drop in value? You're living in a dream world pal.

I don't try and deny that ordering hits is okay in this case - it isn't.
But I do know the following:
1. During the times these "hits" occurred, DPR was already under a massive sting operation. He was eating out of their hands for god knows how many months. These guys are very capable of pushing somebody into certain situations to make them act the way they want.
2. Nobody actually died. DPR did not actually hurt anybody. That should mean something
3. Ordering hits goes directly against his morals which he is very vocal about. As it stands currently, I still trust him more than federal prosecutors - and we haven't yet heard his side of it.

Fallacy. You can't blindly assume people feel the same about BTC as they do about USD.
In the USD monetary system, wages and salary **must increase to track inflation**.
This rule does not hold true in the bitcoin economy and everyone involved fully understands this and expects to get less bitcoins as its exchange rate rises.


@_date: 2013-12-22 00:05:56
Yes, and they did it for the same reasons. The difference is that other currencies don't have the same multi-national reach of USD and consequently result in less world-wide exploitation.
The more you keep spreading your money around, the more value you can suck out without anyone noticing. 
USD's reserve status means that USA gets the ability to spend the value of other countries economic output at their leisure. Also consider that a big nation like USA has motives and needs that frequently do not align with most of the actual users of their currency.
While the USD was indeed an excellent tool for America to dominate the world, it was not *good for* the world and it eventually has to come to an end.

Any pool that did that would be outed pretty quick and nobody would use it. Some of us miners actually do look at the block chain.
That said, if they *disclosed* this to the miners and maybe offered an extra financial incentive, it sounds like it could be a working business model.

This is excellent. Payment technologies are headed in this direction (see Google Wallet) but Bitcoin has the advantage of being low cost, global, anonymous, and permanent. The downside is that it's *slow*.
Also, I would be wary of trying to implement your own bitcoin wallet. This would have to be open source for anyone to trust it and keeping it up to date and secure would be extremely difficult.
The way that makes sense to me is that user swipes phone, your app receives the payment request, then instructs the installed bitcoin wallet to send a payment to the vendor.
Vendor's hardware sees the payment on the Bitcoin network and approves the transaction.
However this scenario you are still looking at a propagation delay to confirm the transaction went through.
Am I missing something? Could you please go into more detail about your implementation of the service?

Bitcoin may always be volatile against the dollar, but I don't think it will always be volatile against gold as adoption increases.

Okay I did a little digging and found the official RPC supports the method SendFrom() so it should definitely be possible to select which coins you want to move.

Not true, I do see legitimate discussion about weaknesses and pitfalls.  The real issue is there are not a whole lot of fundamental drawbacks to Bitcoin.
Trying to imagine a scenario where Bitcoin crashes and burns is currently very difficult.
On the flip side, it is very easy to see how adoption will continue to grow and how it could lead to massive growth.

That was actually pretty clever and I see your point.
But it does not address my initial argument that it's unfair to compare Bitcoin with communication protocols that can't make its creators rich.
Even if everyone supports bitcoin, they may also support alternate implementations in an effort to get rich. This incentive structure did not exist with other protocols.

They don't need to sign anything, they have already proven it to 99% of rational observers. It takes some incredible leaps of faith to believe that someone else moved those coins.

Yeah, we should ignore those silly quacks who think you should be able to send money to anyone, anywhere, without having to pay high 3rd party fees.
Clearly, Paypal is so awesome we don't need anything better. Obviously, the government needs to be able to print money to pay for wars. And of course, if money is not constantly losing value nobody will spend it.
Bitcoin is really solving totally non-existant problems.

I've seen you see this a few times now. You seem to be saying that the central banks can inject money into the system, enough money that can be used to repay all debts.
This money would have to be spent into the economy (banks) which will then use it to create more dollars at a ratio of 9:1.
How does this solve the problem, when trying to add money to pay off the debt just creates more debt?

But that's also why Freicoin will never catch on. In a free market, people don't want to use a money that constantly loses value. There is zero benefit for the users of the money.
The only reason people do it now is because of currency lock-in.
@_date: 2013-03-27 03:59:51


The fact that seems so far fetched is sad, really. Right now if you hold dollars for 10 years you are *guaranteed to lose value* because of forced inflation. Now people have begun to believe that the only way money can exist is when its value is decreasing.
It's not true.
Anything with the qualities of money are enough to make people want to use it for exchange. Bitcoin is proving that right now just as precious metal did centuries before.
