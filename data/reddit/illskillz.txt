Debit &amp; credit cards are down due to internet being down to an outage from an ISP, long banknotes.
Deibt &amp; credit cards are down due to an electricity outage, buy gold.

Are there really monthly fees associated with this? I thought the business model would be to pay the initial upfront costs + an additional maintenance fee that would be invested and the earnings/interest would be managed &amp; utilized by the company indefinitely to pay monthly preservation costs. Maintenace fee would obviously need to be quite substantial though given that it would only pay out 4-5%/year on average

you'd have to be pretty dumb to long short bitcoin

Depends on if you want actual gold, a gold certificate, or a gold derivative and/or something 'backed' by gold

Stop using winrar and start using REAL encryption software. I personally recommend [Veracrypt]( - it's the successor to TrueCrypt
@_date: 2019-03-11 14:44:32
Winrar is a compression program, but people use it for encryption/password protection as well. Veracrypt is much better encryption software, but is not designed to help with compression

No, Visa never assumes any risk. The risk is always borne by either the merchant bank or issuing bank (cardholders bank). Why pretend to know shit you clearly don't know?  
I used to work in the industry FYI

A marketing manager that the company doesn't entrust to make marketing decisions, despite 'manager' status. Classic!

And all the physical infrastructure that needs to be created, maintained, and powered. A hell of a lot more than electricity used by all PoW mining operations cominbed.
@_date: 2018-10-26 23:00:27
No, Visa doesn't assume that risk. Either the merchant or card issuers (banks) assume the risk, depending on what the issue is.

3. Meh, no such thing as decentralized. There's degrees of decentralization. And Bitcoin is fairly decentralized. One way that it's not is it terms of mining + mining hardware manufacturing.
5. Not anonymous. Pseudonymous. Haven't you heard of blockchain forensics?
6. In all likelihood, there will be some altcoin that ends up performing better. Even though Bitcoin has beaten most of them in 2019 so far, there are still a couple of outliers
7. No, better than gold.

As long as you use Bitcoin after asking that I don't see the problem with that. If you didn't after that said they did, yes that would be a dick move.
"Do you accept AMEX"
"Yes, we do!"

Real crypto projects (Libra is not one) have nothing to fear from Libra. In fact, it'll help get more people comfortable using digital currency. It'll help get people who are scared of water to dip their feet into the pond. Some will go deeper, many still won't, but Libra is effectively a new (digital) fiat currency that's pegged to other fiat currencies. And let's face it, Libra will have much easier usability/UX/UI than cryptocurrencies right now. It's an easier place to start that isn't so overwhelming.

Fiat value going down. Gold has been on a massive bull run since end of May 
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:17:39
Don't beat yourself up over it. You could have said the same when it was going down. 15k 11k, 9k, 6k were all called as 'bottoms' on the way down. What reason was there to believe 3k was the real bottom? Many called for it to go down to 1k! All these price prediction experts are full of shit. You don't know where the bottom is/was until it's gone up from the bottom for 2-3 months. And then you're not at the bottom anymore.

hmm, interesting, might insist on DAI only then when selling, but I guess it'll depend on local laws. Will have to get more familiar with it when it's time.

Because Gemini jacked their prices sky high. It's 2% now... and even then that's only on transactions above $200 otherwise it climbs even higher. Insanity. Their fees used to be 0.25%

This is all horrendous advice - in most cases you'll want to do the opposite of what he says.
Never go all-in would be a fair statement, but saying don't go all in at a 'high' is a ridiculous statement. How can you know when I high is? It's definitely possible 13000 could seem low in a few months time (or high).
DCA is generally a good idea, but if you genuinely believe you're at the bottom of a bear market or the start of a bull market, you may want to reconsider. The bull market *could* continue for a while so I wouldn't say your decision is a horrible one. Funny how says 'find a good entry point' - THAT'S THE OPPOSITE OF DCAing! Furthermore, no one knows dec/jan was the best entry point until it was clear we were in a bull market - we didn't know that until march. And then you couldn't buy at those low prices anymore. Furthermore, if the bull market continues (a decent likelihood, the bear market lasted one year after all) it'll be back up above 13400 soon enough; you wouldn't have to wait 3-6 months.


Not quite. That's the case with pump and dumps. Not the case with Bitcoin, stocks, commodities, and anything with a decent market cap &amp; liquidity.


None of them know what they're doing. Over 50% lose money!
HODLing is also horrible advice. Buy if you think prices will go up over the forseeable future (not week, but maybe 3-12 months). Sell if you think it'll go down.
Loses are already there whether you've sold or not. It's not a taxable loss. But don't spew the 'it's not a loss BS'. The value is whatever the current value is.
This is the worst post I've ever seen here.

We're starting getting into semantics here. Yes, Libra will use cryptography, so perhaps based on that it would be fair to call it a cryptocurrency. The problem is it's kind of ridiculous to call both Bitcoin and Facebook cryptocurrencies since they're so far apart. Libra far more resembles fiat currency even though cryptography is used. Ideally, there should be different words we can use the differentiate between different digital currencies.
I'm not a fan of EOS by any means, but I do believe it's more decentralized than what Libra will be. Libra will have more nodes, yes, but Libra &amp; nodes are subject to governance rules &amp; admission by a single company, that is also the developer. Furthermore, they are subject to government censorship. While EOS is by no means decentralized, the masternodes are free to do whatever they like without censorship. And EOS holders vote them in and out accordingly. No government involvement, and not so much involvement from Block one in day to day governance.
Their smart contract platform could indeed be a real threat because not all applications need the features that more decentralized smart contract platforms offer.

No, that's not really the point. The point is being able to transfer funds from one party to the other without having to use a trusted third party (middleman)
If you go with a Bitcoin escrow option instead, make it so buyers can't back out so easy then. Use a multi-sig wallet if necessary.


I guess I'm stupid then - planning to list my own place for sale and insist on payment only in BTC or DAI. No volatility issue with DAI


This should be done before any payment is made, and actually is the case at least where I'm from. You put in a conditional offer with such conditions, the seller accepts (no funds transfered), the seller has to remove conditions/subjects within about a week (can vary). Only once conditions are removed is a deposit made. Balance is paid just before transfer of title.

If people want to have free elections, there's no way that's going to happen under the Maduro regime. And it's not possible for there to be no regime in charge at all. Someone needs to force Maduro out in order to have an election. Having an interim president 'set' is the best option towards eventually having a real democracy.

Also, ponzi schemes and pyramid schemes have quite a few differences from one another. MLM schemes like Herbalife can be a pyramid scheme, but rarely are they ponzi schemes. Madoff investments had no pyramid scheme, but was clearly a ponzi scheme.
