Tell that to the numerous successful darknet vendors.
Bitcoin is a perfect match as long as you know what you are doing.

Yeah, it comes down to the power supply really.
At the time when I used Asicminer USBs - feels like an eternity since I shut them down. I had to swap the stock power supply of the hub to run all miners at once.
Most widespread hubs are shipped with lowly PSUs.

DoNotTrackMe offers easy to use email aliases. Works very well for me.

The truth must be downvoted when the subject is realities in the US.
It truly shows how ignorant, selfish and stupid Americans are.
I wonder what the creators of the constitution would do in such circumstances.

Alternative coins are more like penny stocks. 
I wouldn't spend money on any of them.

Based on the ideas present in the constitution somehow I don't think that they would be happy considering the current affairs of .gov.
Meanwhile the american "citizens" don't seem to care unless entertainment or government handouts stop.

While that is true, restoring them will be high priority.
If the basic utilities go down then money won't be high priority, be it government issued fiat, precious metals or bitcoin.

That comment had about 5 downvotes when I chimed in.
If you don't like it then downvote it.
