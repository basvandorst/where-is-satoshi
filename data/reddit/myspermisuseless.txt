You mean it will stabilize around 170? I can live with that for a couple of days. But 160 like is now, fuck me.
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:55:45
Will do. I'm sure holding to my BTC, granted is nit much, but hey...only what I can afford to loose.
@_date: 2013-04-04 11:26:58
Hey, thanks!
Don't worry about the downvotes, who knows. It is quite exciting, and yes...is very tempting, but I'm doing my best to resist it :)
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:46:45
I'm very tempted, not 10K, but 5K...
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:50:09
I don't get this comment. I took 2.2k of my "I can afford to loose this" money and learnt a shit ton of money, currency, crypto and more. So if anything it was a great lesson. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:44:44
Big for me...I have like...a gazillion zilillion (5) coins
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:55:00
Ok. What about the fees? Would it be the same if it was one order?
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:59:03
Great analysis, thanks. Hopefully comes true and my small amount of BTC keep growing in Fiat value. 
Question: if a BTC ends up being worth say 2K Us, in terms of practicity, doesn't a higher value work against BTC as an everyday currency? 
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:02:51
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:04:01
Related: seriously, would you take out a loan, say, 10K to buy BTC right now?
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:44:29
Show off! :)
Please tell me you picked up more that 1K worth of BTC...
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:05:25
I think we might get there between today or tomorrow. I have no idea what I'm saying.
But I sure hope so :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:36:33
Someone bought 16MM in BTC? I can't even.. 
Really? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:16:33
I can afford it. I guess I'm riding this. Thanks, one of the few real advice in here.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:44:14
I'm taking a big hit now. I bought at 196 Euros and is now at 174...damn!
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:01:59
I got to be honest, Paper Wallets scare the hell out of me. I just don't get it plus all these stories about people getting their wallets stolen, etc.
Any good resources on once I have my coins in Bitcoin-Qt how to move them to paper wallets?
@_date: 2013-04-10 11:15:40
Oh, so when I backup my .dat in there are my priv keys?
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:48:26
I bought 1K at 196Euros/BTC so yeah, I'm enjoying this :\
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:15:27
Amen to that. I'm in it for the long haul. Thankfully I have some Buffer as I bought at $64 as well. But man, hurts like hell hahaha
@_date: 2013-04-01 11:00:17
Thanks! 
@_date: 2013-03-23 19:21:01
EDIT: My purchased passed! 10BTC, finally. Let's see how it goes.
I'm new to bitcoin. I'm ready to drop a couple grand (been following it since it was at $7 and going...oh no, that's not going to go up...FML).
Anyhow, I have a US account so I tried with Coinbase, being backed by YC and all...yeah no bitcoins for me.
I applied to Mt.Gox and I'm in the process of getting my account validated... (I also have European Accounts)
I want to buy 10 BTC right now...can someone enlightend me as to how to do it?
Everything seems to be: wait 100 years for Coinbase to work, wait a decade for Mt.Gox to approve you...Wait, wait, wait.
TAKE MY MONEY!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:28:55
Oh it is, everything I have in it, I can afford to loose. But it has been fun seeing it go up!
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:11:08
For the not so tech savvy, care to explain?
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:31:31
Well, I did SPAM the buy button for like 30 minutes. 
I think I got in at 64 I think. Now let's see what happens.
What's your take on where is it going, up or down?
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:54:46
I don't want to be THAT guy, but your account is 0 days old, ehem...new like, right now new.
The skeptical in me thinks you are looking for a big tip from If you are not, then I sincerely apologize.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:53:31
It was incredible. The price shot like you say like $2 and keep on going, it was very exciting!
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:03:28
Say my PC goes to the shitter and I need to restore my .dat. I'm very confused about the whole private key thing. Would you mind expanding on this?
@_date: 2013-04-10 09:56:14
Thanks, but I must be a dumbass, because I can't understand this.
When you say my file, what do you mean?
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:13:04
I guess our "Pilot" that was doing the announcement on how the value goes down on the weekends was...not right ;)
I know it usually does but it has only gone up. What's your take, will it drop a bit before monday or it will continue to rise?
I trust we will be way past $150 by next friday.
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:55:30
Dude, chill. How is learning a shit ton, tied with: I now know everything there's to know and I'll have all the answer from now own? 
Do you know exactly what to do now? Enlighten me. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:55:01
I'm with you, but not by the end of the week though. 
I think probably within 4 weeks :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:19:23
Will do, will do. 
I actually told my brother to buy some BTC (I had no money at the time) when it was at $7. He did not listen and I did not have any money.
Now, things picked up a bit for me and I can buy them at $64, so yeah. :)
Just picked up 10 over at Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:00:02
I just made a purchased of 10BTC about 10 minutes ago.
Now... what will happen with BTC...Up or down?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:45:48
The lag is to damn high! One second I'm looking at 149 Euros, another second is at 165. I'm getting a seizure over here!
@_date: 2013-04-06 17:37:24
Thanks! Very helpful!
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:02:45
Please make this a thing!

Love it!

I just read this, and now I'm more confused:
*Securing the Bitcoin-QT or bitcoind wallet
Bitcoin transactions send Bitcoins to a specific public key. A Bitcoin address is an encoded hash of a public key. In order to use received Bitcoins, you need to have the private key matching the public key you received with. This is sort of like a super long password associated with an account (the account is the public key). Your Bitcoin wallet contains all of the private keys necessary for spending your received transactions. If you delete your wallet without a backup, then you no longer have the authorization information necessary to claim your coins, and the coins associated with those keys are lost forever.
The wallet contains a pool of queued keys. By default there are 100 keys in the key pool. The size of the pool is configurable using the "-keypool" command line argument. When you need an address for whatever reason (send, “new address”, generation, etc.), the key is not actually generated freshly, but taken from this pool. A brand new address is generated to fill the pool back to 100. So when a backup is first created, it has all of your old keys plus 100 unused keys. After sending a transaction, it has 99 unused keys. After a total of 100 new-key actions, you will start using keys that are not in your backup. Since the backup does not have the private keys necessary for authorizing spends of these coins, restoring from the old backup will cause you to lose Bitcoins.
Creating a new address generates a new pair of public and private keys, which are added to your wallet. Each keypair is mostly random numbers, so they cannot be known prior to generation. If you backup your wallet and then create more than 100 new addresses, the keypair associated with the newest addresses will not be in the old wallet because the new keypairs are only known after creating them. Any coins received at these addresses will be lost if you restore from the backup.
The situation is made somewhat more confusing because the receiving addresses shown in the UI are not the only keys in your wallet. Each Bitcoin generation is given a new public key, and, more importantly, each sent transaction also sends some number of Bitcoins back to yourself at a new key. When sending Bitcoins to anyone, you generate a new keypair for yourself and simultaneously send Bitcoins to your new public key and the actual recipient's public key. This is an anonymity feature – it makes tracking Bitcoin transactions much more difficult.
So if you create a backup, do more than 100 things that cause a new key to be used, and then restore from the backup, some Bitcoins will be lost. Bitcoin has not deleted any keys (keys are never deleted) – it has created a new key that is not in your old backup and then sent Bitcoins to it.*
Can someone ILI5 please?
