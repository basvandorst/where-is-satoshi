- More Transactions

LocalBitcoins / Segwit may have something to do with this :)

Your have access to what’s called a debit card that allows you to use your cash. 
You don’t use a card?
Analogy doesn’t work.

Many branches function this way with a 10k limit.
The 10k limit some branches use is based on the Patriot Act to fight counter terrorism and criminal activity. It’s been in place since 2001.
Over 10k and you will he asked more detailed information about the transaction.

What do you do for a living? I’m quite curious

I’m simply stating the Federal Reserve system and  OCC regulating the banks is a good thing. 
Saying bitcoin or crypto is where you should put all your resources (because 1 branch didn’t have your cash that day) is hustling-backwards.

Lol your people got a dress code. Step up homie.

Agreed. I know it may not sound like it but I’m a fan of evolving technologies in the blockchain and crypto spaces. That said the US banking system is one of the best in the world and IS better than any current crypto system. As these blockchain technologies evolve banks will also use them as we are seeing. Cash, credit, debt, securities, bonds, cryptocurrencies are all part of a financial system. Crypto currency will never stand alone because no financial instrument ever has.
BUT for crypto boys that have 0 background in finance, banking or regulations I have to speak up...don’t put all your eggs in one basket. Especially not crypto currency.

I used to work in banks cash management and my professional education background is in finance
Think of a bank branch as your local “store”. Their cash is their inventory. 
Some branches never sell/withdraw any cash because people don’t really need it in their area. People use cards and ATMs for almost everything.
Cash movement is tracked and reported back to the mothership and armored trucks only drop off the cash that’s anticipated based on average client activity. They need to ensure they have enough cash everyday for ALL clients (emergency cash can always be ordered but they will charge that branch’s cost center most likely and the manager will hear about it).
If you withdraw 10k and it’s Friday payday and cashed checks are coming in it might throw off the cash balance leaving poor little Joe Worker unable to cash his $500 check. Not cool either right? Well why don’t the banks keep at million at every branch!? Well then the tellers would need to carry handguns...
You can always plan ahead and order your cash so the branch will have it ready for you.
Putting your faith completely into crypto or bitcoin is foolish. Your bank account is insured up to 250,000. Show me an exchange or wallet that does that.
Thinking like this are why crypto  currencies will be regulated in the United States as all financial products and services are. To protect you from thieves and yourself.
