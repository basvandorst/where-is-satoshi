Now.  I just doubled down! I am new to the game, bought some last week, bought double that today.  
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:14:13
I bought MORE cause the price dropped!
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:29:46
roger that! thanks
@_date: 2017-09-03 22:29:04
Two things that will fuck you in the game.  Complacency and greed.
@_date: 2017-09-06 19:13:54
I'm one of them!  Let's ride this shit to 500k!
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:27:41
Don't get scared 
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:23:40
I bought in around 4k. This is exciting!  I'm hodl until 10k no matter what!  And buying as much as I can afford to lose, instead of video games, or booze, it's all bitcoin from now on!

It's almost as if talking shit, is actually trying to control a narrative for profit.
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:56:17
Both my children and my parents think I'm an idiot
@_date: 2017-09-03 19:38:13
I have bills to pay so if they take bitcoin then sure.  If not, I have little choice.  I win, if my bills are paid.

There is no such thing as free money. EVER.  Who falls for this shit?

Interesting, what
* Made you sign up?
I signed up because of two things. One, I don't believe in the US Dollar, I think they are about to use hyperinflation to make it useless and use that as a means to introduce the Amero.  I don't believe in gold either.  And I wanted a way to make my money work for me instead of sitting in a safe in my house.
* When did you first hear about bitcoin?
LOL....I first heard about bitcoin at the beginning.  I wasn't in the place where I could invest and I sort of forgot about it, boy do I wish I had just bought a few coins back then.
* Why did you buy?
The same reasons I posted above.

Shitposting is shitposting is shitposting is shitposting..  That said, I upvoted anyways, cuz I've made over 10k with this shit.

Remind me when he got ripped off.
@_date: 2017-09-03 13:57:02
I'm glad the price dropped, I'm just now getting in and this is a great opportunity for me to buy more before it hits 5k, then 10k.  Everyone hodl hands and hodl!
@_date: 2017-09-04 14:00:34
cool story bro
@_date: 2017-09-06 11:00:58
It's almost to $5000 again :)  I think it might hit it by end of week.  I've more than tripled my investment, holding to the top! (I treated it like gambling, I took my initial investment out and now am playing with free "money")
@_date: 2017-09-04 12:15:24
Silliest argument ever, I'm talking about bragging about being wealthy you are way off context, learn to read kid. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 09:12:54
I'm new to bitcoin, how will this affect my holdings? 
@_date: 2017-09-03 12:11:07
You ARE the troll
