Does it support btc-&gt;usd for Canada?
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:12:47
Yeah but who's exactly locking their btc in our channel? There should be someone or something, that locks their funds in the channel until it's closed, right? Who is that? What is their incentive to keep a channel with me?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:07:36


That's what I'm talking/asking about: if we did that for SW, why can't we do that for block increase?
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:33:32
How can temporary block increase hurt decentralization? I'm running a full node and I'm willing to spend a few GB more, until SW is widely supported and/or LN is done.
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:48:21
Ok I'll rephrase my question. For example, I decided to open channel to LN. Who will be the other party of this channel? Just another random person? Starbucks? A bank? Some exchange? For both of us it's expense, we'll pay fee for at least two on-chain txs. Who will be so generous and pay on-chain tx fee to let me in?

I don't quite understand what makes you think it's going to "rip apart" Bitcoin. We could do something like "if there's 95% consensus, we start accepting 4MB blocks for  to

I don't think it's possible to convert all existing wallets/addresses to segwit, it's gradual process anyways. SW will be common after a year after it's supported with Coinbase and popular wallets. I don't want to disseminate FUD, but BTC can just die while it's slowly happening.

Selling crypto is much bigger pain in Canada than buying, that's what stops people from getting into it (to my experience).
@_date: 2017-08-30 15:38:10


But it's clearly not.
You can manually set fee of 3-5 sat/b and it will be confirmed in next few blocks ([proof]( But wallets keep setting 10x fees because wallets keep setting 10x fees because wallets keep setting 10x fees over and over.
I don't even want to mention goddamn Coinbase.

@_date: 2017-11-21 14:06:23
Correct me if I'm wrong, but LN txs are not free, they are "pay a fee, lock funds, THEN do tx for free, then pay fee again".
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:51:46


JFC... Why? If a fork happened, we have two networks with two mempools, right? Indeed, transaction from blockchain1 can be included in a next block in blockchain2, but why will miners take those transactions at the first place? Just because they can? Because their own mempool will be empty and they will need to scoop some txs from blockchain1? Because they target this specific address A?

Make a transaction that moves all your bitcoins to another address, broadcast it to 2x (bch/shtc/whatever) blockchain and wait a few confirmations there. Problem solved!
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:53:27


So let's outline the worst-case scenario: all miners evenly distribute their hashrate between two blockchains and take top 1MB of txs from one joined mempool, sorted by tx fee. There're two identical blockchains (with incompatible block headers), with the same difficulty, and they never diverge, so ALL transactions are mirrored in two blockchains.
That what should happen to invalidate that manual A1-B1/A2-C2 "replay protection". What is probability of this to happen?
@_date: 2017-11-07 22:29:34




Let's remove this "miner mining on chain 1". [Economically motivated] miners mine blocks for most profitable blockchain at the moment. How are they [economically] motivated to mine blocks for both blockchains? Even if they are (how?), both blockchains will have different difficulties and different fees, and will diverge pretty quickly (miners may want to spend coinbase somehow).

@_date: 2017-11-07 19:30:40


I didn't say A1 and A2 different. Of course they are a) yours b) have the same keys.




That's not clear for me. Why would miners take transaction from blockchain1? What's the incentive of including those "foreign" transactions into a next block? Your argument "because it has some fees attached" doesn't look valid, because all transactions have some fee attached.


But what I said is the same, because after A1-&gt;B1, A2-&gt;C2, your can't replay A2-&gt;C2 or A1-&gt;C1.

@_date: 2017-11-21 17:23:51
Yeah for people should treat LN coins as equal to on-chain coins (i.e. trust technology), and keep their funds in LN channels, to make the whole idea work.
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:51:48
Maybe I don't quite understand that.
Let's say I have address A. After a fork, it becomes A1 and A2. I make transaction A1-&gt;B1 and A2-&gt;C2. So the original address has zero balance, and I have two decoupled addresses.
Now I need to make a transaction to malicious vendor M that replays all incoming transactions. I make transaction B1-&gt;M1, and it can't be replayed on forked blockchain, because B2-&gt;M2 is not valid (B2's balance is zero), and A2-&gt;B2 is not valid too (A2's balance was transferred to C2).
So the only way to perform replay attack is to thoroughly mirror someone's transactions on forked blockchain, to not let them make decoupled addresses.
Where am I wrong?

Maybe you have an answer for this simple question. If I want to join the LN, aka "open a channel", who's going to be the counterpart? Who's going to a) lock funds for me b) pay a fees to make on-chain open/close transactions?

It's bullshit because transferring money and storing wealth is not that banks are all about. A bank, regulated and controlled by a government provide a) trust b) loans c) money transfers. Cryptocurrencies can take c) (like old good cash), but there's no way bitcoin (eth, ltc whatever) will ever provide a) or b). Banks will do it, even if BTC will be the only money in the world. They will just become BTC banks.

Who will run nodes for a blockchain that grows even 128MB every 10 minutes? It's 18GB a day, 6.5 TB a year, so even spinning up a BSV node will be nearly impossible after few years, let alone running it 24/7.
