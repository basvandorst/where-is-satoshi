Almost time for day traders to go home

Lightning is a good thing. Blockchain is so backed up now it’s becoming impossible to confirm a transaction. Without lightning bitcoin would become useless for transactions

So 30,000 coins swap hands per day on gdax  I’d assume at minimum 30% are long HODL positions especially of New investors getting approved. So 70k new long positions on gdax each week. Factor in all the other exchanges and you’re probably looking at an absolute minimum of 250k new long positions per week. With only 22 million coins, estimated 4-5 million lost forever. This still has a ton of room to run in upcoming months

I watched it. None was removed it was all eaten up.

Why you all so scared all of a sudden? Let this thing breathe and accumulate. Let Kong’s come in between 14300 and 14800 for weeks for all I care. Believe in the tech. Btc is still king. Once accumulation is done we run. I’m not scared till below 5. Go look up Moore’s law and you can see still on path for 100k by 2020.

Look at CBOE went up 20%. People who want to short need skin in the game. There’s a buy order for 1.37 million at 15,500

It’s backed up for days right now 
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:18:53
Did the same. I’ll HODL until 8k breaks

It’s the btc blockchain backed up. Some transactions taking days. Always put higher gas if you want it mined quicker

We’re running the next big dip will be from 23 ��

We haven’t even broken support yet. Financial investors have more money set aside in 2018 for crypto. They shorted from 20 realistically probably down to 8k before we moon again. They want as much volatility as possible. They want all our bitcoin for as cheap as possible. Just lock it away and chill 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:18:16
People getting shook now. Not much support

The guy selling blocks of 25 is extremely annoying. Make him pay 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:09:33
That’s exactly what’s going to happen. Markets going to be very manipulated
