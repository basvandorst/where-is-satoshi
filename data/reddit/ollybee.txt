What is still no clear to me is whether he has defaulted on the interest he promised or of he is just straight stealing all the bitcoins invested?
Given his real identity is known the latter seems unlikely but I think the total value of the fund is in millions so he might just disappear.

I was a shop manager in the UK occasionally we would get tourists who only had dollars or euro's I would always accept. As a rule I would consider was the effort to liquidate the the offered thing (bitcoin, euro , whatever) more than I would put into a sale through extra customer service to get the sale if the answer was no then I would accept. Any business is crazy not to follow these principles.

I fear the issues exchanges have has with UK banks is a deliberate campaign by the authorities. They wont openly try to stop bitcoin for fear of streisand effect. They can bitcoins becoming mainstream in the uk by putting pressure on the banks with the very powerful money laundering laws we have.

Bitcoin transactions are anonymous enough for me. I dont nee the buying of the bitcoins to be anon.

Chinese forum on bitcointalk would be best place to ask

if accepting bitcoin is going to get you free publicity and make you cool in the eyes of an intelligent tech savvy community then you would be crazy not to

This is what I love about bitcoin. I can see a revolution happening and feel part of it. All the discussion is open and in public. If I had strong feelings on how bitcoin should develop I can just can involved.
Open source projects should be the same but not all are. Mysql vs PostgreSQL being a good example (with Postgres being more like bitcoin)

is he giving back people their original investment with no interest or is he paying out nothing at all?
If he has paid any interest that would seem that he used others investments to fund the interest payments and therefore he will be stealing original cash.

No youtube page as far as I know but there are a series of video describing his project open transactions here

I think the subjects being discussed were going over the interviewers head. 
Always good to see OT get exposure as I believe it plays an important part in the long term future of bitcoin.

The bitcoin will be back to around 17.5$/BTC after we rollback all trades that have happened after the huge Bitcoin sale that happened on June 20th near 3:00am (JST).
Service should be back by June 20th 10:00am (JST, 01:00am GMT) with all the trades reversed and accounts available.
One account with a lot of coins was compromised and whoever stole it (using a HK based IP to login) first sold all the coins in there, to buy those again just after, and then tried to withdraw the coins. The $1000/day withdraw limit was active for this account and the hacker could only get out with $1000 worth of coins.
Apart from this no account was compromised, and nothing was lost. Due to the large impact this had on the Bitcoin market, we will rollback every trade which happened since the big sale, and ensure this account is secure before opening access again.

i just made the same point in a comment to a wildly inaccurate post on the (usually excellent) theregister.co.uk

No but I'm certain you can find individuals who will.

No. In theory they could get away with a double spend attack. Even well executed this is no going to net them a huge reward. It would however hugely damage the bitcoin economy in which they are heavily invested.

if he had signed the denial with Satoshi's private key then it would be proof.

Thanks you. If they could partner this with an API or command line client I'd b in geeky fast food heaven.

If they are testing then they should mine on testnet.

I work for a web host and would be concerned about anyone offering bitcoin paid servers/hosting for anonymity. People are going to use that for some shady shit. shady shit servers get hit with reprisal hacks/ddos. There servers are going to be unstable with sysadmins constantly fire fighting. If you want stability you don't want to be sharing resources with a bunch of script kiddies which is Im afraid what bitcoin payment will attract (unless it's bitcoin payment + we still need ID).
