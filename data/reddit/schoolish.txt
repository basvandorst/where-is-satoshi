If we knew we would be daytrading bitcoin and making bank.

All time high.

I've seen a few graphs that do this, so if a lot of futures are being placed around the current price it makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:12:14
Those are some good people right there. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:06:11
How's that, it seems perfectly reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:28:44
You can have a credit card under 18, as long as you have income. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:25:58
You're right I think but you are an unpleasant person. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:47:08
God I hope so. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:01:27
Excuse me sir, the rules clearly state no "upvote if" posts. However yes, I did survive the crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:22:34
It doesn't matter.

This man should not deal with a personal wallet. Just hold on coinbase because he's spending $50. Transfer fee will be higher than the profits he could make on this probably. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:15:52
I actually managed to get all of the BTC, so everyone in this sub is lying. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:51:05
Well I currently have some BTC so I'm a prospective seller
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:09:40
Just has me nervous because I bought more at 16k, I'm not worried about the portion I bought at 8k I just don't like it sitting around. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:25:20
He legally cannot make investments. His parents must make them on his behalf. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:52:02
The storm being good or bad for BTC hodlers in your opinion?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:29:25
For simplicity coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:56:28
I like your voice so I subbed. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:58:21
I hope you're right! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:26:12
Give your parents cash. They use their bank/credit card
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:02:51
He can suck mine if he'd like! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:25:02
I feel like this is not something you should be offering up, even if your intentions are truly good. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:48:07
Yaaaa, I didn't get the email telling me 17k was the high point and 14k was the low point.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:50:18
Did you buy the bitcoin, or are you putting money in the account? If you bought bitcoin coinbase will honor the price you purchased at. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:23:38
I was meaning like if you said 9,000 dollars worth of bitcoin instead of typing 1BTC because the price fluctuates by dollar, and bitcoin stays constant
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:58:53
Can someone who actually read this TL;DR for me? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:05:58
What is this. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:16:55
Did you try to transfer an amount of bitcoin, or a dollar amount? Ive had trouble when trying to move amounts by dollar because the price fluctuates so much
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:28:42
Oh God I I hope he didn't put all his money in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:35:26
It's going to take a lot of people buying back in for BTC to rise again... Hope it hasn't scared too many off. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:32:22
Santa has shown up just in time for Christmas. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:41:54
Risky gamble. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:04:17
Lol ur roommate is gonna be a bit confused when his share of the bill skyrockets don't you think? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:55:49
That right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:44:05
I saw the crude oil actual/crude oil future graph that has been going around. Is that commonly the case, or is that a cherrypicked instance. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:31:37
I didn't sell on the dip, but I'm pretty disappointed I didn't buy on it either. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:02:32
Well guess you gotta wait til bitcoin hits 50k!
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:50:10
Well. Sounds like coinbase for you. Make an account. Link bank account. Buy bitcoin. Hold $50 worth of bitcoin. At best you will make almost no money someday. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:29:11
Lol ur the guy that wanted to teach him via snapchat. Your advice was going to be to steal from his parents. You did it at a much earlier time when investing and turning profit was cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:42:22
Lol... so hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:23:52
If your parents are OK with you spending YOUR money, or if they are willing to invest a little for you, have them set up the account with you. You do all the research and the only thing they should have to do is hook up their bank account. Tell your parents it is a good learning experience for you. If you don't have money and your parents won't give it to you, offer to do work around the house you don't normally do in return for money. I do not recommend you try and do anything without the consent of your parents.
