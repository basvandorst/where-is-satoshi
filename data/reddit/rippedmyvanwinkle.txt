Hey...thanks!  I just saw this.  I think someone else posted a video tutorial or something.  I'll give it a try. 
This shit is complicated, weird and unfamiliar though.  Ugh!  
Thanks for the steps though.

We're not talking about freedom.  We're talking about downloading software that isn't fucked.  
Freedom is easy.  I'm about to go freely take a piss and there isn't a damn thing you can do about it.  
If these guys are going to freak us all out about THEIR SOFTWARE BEING FUCKED, the least they could do is tell us how to ensure it isn't...or is the whole point to cause panic with no recourse?  
If they can't write a series of steps to ensure their software is safe, I don't know if I trust their software which is just a series of steps.

Yeah, it's still not step by step and straight forward.  
It seems everyone likes the two explanations here.  Bitcoin core should post explicit directions on their website and elsewhere.  Hell, why not have a link in the sidebar here?

In other words you don't know the steps or you feel it's beneath you to write them down for us less-thans.  
Are there 6 million steps and it's just too long to write down?  Is this an impossible task?  Does it take you 30 days to accomplish what you're suggesting and by the time you're done you're just too exhausted to let everyone else know how to do it?  
I'm not buying your cop out and insult of "can't handle keeping your computer secure" even with the added vague pleasantry of hoping for better computer security and neither is anyone else.

There are NO steps in your post or the original post.  THOSE ARE NOT STEPS!  Steps are just like I showed you.  
Step 1....  
Step 2...  
Step 3...  
They should be perfectly clear and reproducible even to a moron like me.  
Link to the steps so I know what they are.  The only thing remotely resembling steps that I see seem to be for you guys when you release new software.  Where are the steps for the end user?  
I saw something about uploading my signature which made no sense to me.  
There should be just some simple steps so I know I've downloaded the correct software.  Whether I fuck it up from there is on me.

So...don't try to learn dummy.

The talk should just go, "Bitcoin Core has taken over and until a fork occurs, it will not grow.  One Meg Greg has stopped Bitcoin."

I don't know how to do any of that.  Why can't people make it easy for us dummies?  I mean what the fuck are the steps?  
Step 1...do some shit.
Step 2...do some more shit.
Step 3...do final shit.
Step 4...fucking done.
Why does everyone in this space tell you to do some shit you have no fucking clue how to do and not provide any fucking instructions?  
Edit:  Here's what I'm going to do.  I'll download the shit that it says to download on the site.  If it's fucked and I lose my bitcoins, I won't fucking use bitcoin anymore because you guys can't even give me the correct file to download.  Fuck it.  Government wins.  They're better than you and my money is far safer.

If they are going to scare us, they need to write the steps.  It's that simple.
