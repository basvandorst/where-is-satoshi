no you can print your own paper wallet for free at bitaddress.org.
what makes an address cold is that the private key has never been exposed to the internet. you can google instructions on how to do it basically you want to use the address generator from bitaddress.org on an offline computer that is 100% free from malware or viruses. 
whatever you do make sure you at least store your btc in an address that you control the private key for. do.not leave your btc on an exchange or coinbase wallet. greenaddress.it offers a pretty safe wallet using multisig although its new and a little slow. Do some research and ask questions. All the info you need is readily available.

Pretty sure "bridgewalker bitcoin wallet" had the same deal. Seems like they shut down as soon as the downtrend started. So what is the plan to keep the company afloat during an extended  downtrend? Are they hoping for a bubble so they can make enough money off customers bitcoin gains to float them during a downtrend? Or will they just shut down like bridgewalker when things dont go their way? Isn't this also sort of like the "Neo and Bee Euro pegged accounts scam"? Please enlighten me if Im missing something

Most exchanges ask you to change your deposit address after so long. It's just good practice. They should have asked you to do it though. Not surprise you. That being said even if you send funds to an older deposit address they should still show up. Must be some other issue. I've used btc - for almost 2 years now and never had any problems. 
I have no reason to trust btc e any more or less than any other exchange. Yes they are anonymous but it seems that if they weren't they would probably have issues. Don't leave coins at any exchange

I've used coin.mx several times with no issues. The only problem is the 7% fee for debit card deposits and the market price tends to be around 5% higher there.
There is an option to make a cash deposit to their bank account for free but I haven't tried it yet. I only use coin.mx when I need bitcoin fast.

Hmmm well I don't know specifically of a site where you can play chess for bitcoin but the potential is there. There are poker sites like that I know. Sealswithclubs.eu is a popular site for poker. Many others. I don't know if there's a site for chess but I wouldn't doubt it. 
When playing any game against other players for btc you'll need a site or a person to act as escrow to guarantee everything is fair. I like that idea honestly I would be surprised if there's a site lime that out there I just don't know of any.

I have drink machines at ky.job that accept credit cards. With quaters it costs $0.75. If your dumb enough to use your card its $1.50. Plus whatever your bank may charge you if you have a prepaid debit or whatever. Btc would be a great option. A lot cheaper and there is no need to wait for confirmations on such small purchases especially if they use a processor or off chain.

I'm guessing from everything I've read it will be somewhere around 6 months before we have tools in place for creating trustworthy contracts for these types of things. But I think 2 years before we actually see any significant amount of people trusting DAO's for insurance. Then it'll be a fight to allow the consumer the choice to use them. Overall 5 years is my guess (which is a relatively short time and seems to be an optimistic timeline) I honestly believe things like this will catch on quicker with the average person than currency. If it's just as easy to sign an insurance contract with a dao and it covers your legal obligations plus saves a ton of money people will use it. It's the legal part that will take some time.

Dont store coins at exchanges, only store coins on wallets that you control the private keys for.
Always check out businesses or people you deal with because once you sejd someone bitcoin, you can't force them to.give it back.
Investors should never panic buy or panic sell because at this time bitcoin is still very new and the value can be volatile.
Always use a 2 factor authentication when logging into accounts that have access to bitcoin or your funds.
theres a few off the top of my head....

I haven't use bitpay from the merchant side. I would suggest coinbase even though I'm not a fan of their customer service or security practices overall...
I would make sure you help him get it set up and make sure he enables all available security features and understands how to use them.
Also talk to him about possibly saving a small percentage of bitcoin in a cold address. 
I'm still working on my landlord, he likes cash and likes to meet up in pers9n everytime which is a huge pain for me. Plus i usually have to pay atm fees to get the cash. Bitcoin would be awesome to use to pay my rent.

The easiest way to do what your wanting is to go to blockchain.info and set up a wallet there. Then download the blockchain android app and pair it with your online wallet. Greenaddresss.it also work for this. You get what's called a "seed" or pneumonic when you create your online wallet and simply type that pneumonic into the android wallet as well. Electrum is another seed based wallet but the android install is a little tricky. 
basically what your wallet does is store the private key associated with each bitcoin address you create and monitor the balance of the address. You can add a private key from any desktop wallet to any smartphone wallet and have access to the same balance but you'll need to know what your doing and how to export/import the private keys securely. I'd go with blockchain, greenaddress or electrum to keep it simple. Just make sure you have all your security options set up and active and tested before you send btc to the new address. Always use 2fa for online wallets, a good unique password that you have written down somewhere and back up your wallets.

Ive used cryptsy for almost a year now with no real issues. I think i had a delayed withdrawal once and also once my balance showed twice as much btc as I really had but quickly corrected. other than that no problems. that being said you should never just leave coins there. make your trades and withdrawal to safety.

Hacked is a broad term I guess. An early attempt at gaming the system that was discovered and remedied It was not successful after all. All I'm saying is if bitcoin had known vulnerabilities today it obviously would not be as valuable. Just as newer cryptos that have not proved themselves over time.

all depends on what you plan on doing with the cash....if you need to buy something or pay a bill...try doing it with btc....if you only bought in for short term speculation and wish to cash out i would just use coinbase for quick and easy...localbtc will take more work but its good for networking and can score you a higher return usually. i would hold for a year or two until its more developed or if you just need some cash sell part and store a small amount you can forget about for awhile.

It's almost a certainty that US regulated bitcoin exchanges will be for accredited investors only. Wall Street looks out for the wealthy by giving them the first chance and putting rules in places to keep the little guy out until the biggest gains get realized.

 Coinbase is fine for buying bitcoin but transfer it out to another wallet immediately after purchase. The coinbase wallet doesn't give you the private key which means you don't actually control the bitcoin. If coinbase went down you wouldn't be able to get your btc. You also are counting on them to secure the btc which is not a good idea. Think gox. Use a Multisig wallet like Greenaddresss.it or at least a wallet you control the keys for. For investment purposes cold storage would be best. 
 While I personally think it's a good time to invest anything could happen don't spend anymore than your prepared to lose. Don't plan on buying in and selling in a few weeks for profit or anything like that you have to think long term.
 Do some research and make sure you understand what your doing how to secure your keys properly. Always use 2factor and a unique random password. (Write it down!)
Good luck

Also I would suggest purchasing small amounts over a few days or weeks. Buy a small amount first to play around with and learn. Teach friends about it and don't be scared to give away a few satoshi to get friends started. At this point there's still a big learning curve and it's helps to give some incentive to people to learn.

You cant really do that if you missed a character the address will be invalid. very very low chance you found a valid address by changing a character or two
@_date: 2014-04-30 16:34:41
There will always be plenty of people who do not wish to participate in any controls set forth on bitcoin by governments and that's all we need to insure it doesn't happen. Registering addresses is pointless because people can always generate their own addresses we don't need a central authority to do that. Coloring coins as valid or invalid wont work as long as 51% or more don't want it. We can always fork. I just don't see how any regulation or controls enforcible inside bitcoin. That's the beauty of it. And should it evolve into a system where a majority of miners actually want controls the ones who don't will fork or switch to another system that meets their expectations.
Darkwallet and "openbazzar" are huge IMO. I believe the more private and untouchable it becomes the more value it will have. The big reason btc grew so fast was lack of regulation. The only controls or regulations I want are built into the protocol. Freedom is the important implication of bitcoin in my mind.

You have to understand, scammers post sad stories and beg for bitcoin all the time. If I were you I would post some proof. Plenty people here willing to help legitimate causes but linking a craiglist ad and posting a sad story is easy. Maybe some pics of the burbt house with links to news stories and ID yourselves. That could help, I would be willing to help a little if I knew it was legit. Keep in mind begging is against the rules on this sub.

Your correct every wallet I know of have a request feature. There are also merchant based wallets (blockchain merchant for one) that does this by default
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:36:52
They could scan your address and send a payment request. Then you just check the amount and sign it. Same mechanics.
This is already available their are merchant apps already that do this as default. Plus most wallets are able to send payment requests with the amount already input

@_date: 2014-05-03 04:46:34
Well if you want to bet on historical patterns, we should be in a strong uptrend by the end of may and another bubble by summer. so If you believe the historical pattern will continue, now and the next 3-4 weeks are the best time to buy and hold.
Another historical truth is at this point any person who bought and held for at least one year have made huge gains. 
In my opinion yes its the perfect time to buy and hold. The bitcoin economy is growing rapidly as well as infrastructure. We are seeing the beginings. Theres a lot of great news that has failed to spur a bull run because of the china BS. But its makes for a good price.
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:05:11
But it doesnt come from nothing. It takes processing power, electricity, time and work. The all have value and cost money. 
Also there are plenty of people and services that acceot btc directly. But if they used a service to exchange it instantly for cash what difference does that make? The fact that it can be exchanged for cash shows its valuable. Sounds a little like your just trolling. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 04:59:54

One thing I have to admit is there customer service is on point. You have an issue you can immediately chat with a rep and emails are respond to within an hour. Can't say anything good about any other exchanges customer service coinbase completely sucks on that front.
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:47:33
It's true that any one person wanting to cash out a large amount of btc on any of the current exchanges that do not have the liquidity would cause a price drop. But in this case it doesn't mean it's only "rich on paper" that term comes from stock markets. A stock certificate is not currency for the most part and is only liquid in the stock market. If one wanted to exchange their btc wealth for something more stable they could exchange it directly for gold, real estate, or any number of valuable real items. If I traded btc for a multi-million dollar piece of property or a company I may have to negotiate off the market rate some but that doesn't mean it's not real wealth. Crashing an exchange in dollar terms only matters if you feel dollars are the best place to keep value long term. Which is obviously not true.

Well shit man that was sept 2010. Bitcoin was just getting started, of course there will be bugs to work out of a new protocol that's exactly why bitcoin wasn't worth very much back then and why it grows in value as time passes or slumps when there's doubt. As time passes, bugs get worked out, system gets tested on larger and larger scales, confidence grows and value rises. The first implementation of any software will have bugs to work out. Bitcoin is still in beta by the way and it's still a big experiment. There's no guarantees and most users know that. If there was there would be no speculation. This isn't a ready for consumption product backed by some company. It's an open source decentralized experiment.
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:37:50
$100 in a savings account will likely still be close to $100 in a year although inflation and the cost of goods rising may make it have less purchasing power in a year.
Bitcoin will likely have more purchasing power in a year if the past trends continue but ultimately could fail and be worth less (i highly doubt it will be worth nothing)
Saving in bitcoin is a higher risk/higher possible reward scenario. Do some research and form.your own opinion. Investing $100 is.not a huge risk and even if lose money it could prove to be a valuable lesson.
Either way make a plan and stick to it. Dont get suckered into panic selling if the value dips and store your btc safely in a cold paper wallet or other cold storage.

If you look at short term, its been in a downtrend since January-ish.
Back up and look at the long term and its been going up consistently for 4 years. The bubbles come an go but everytime a bubble pops it leaves bitcoin with a higher price. Id say yes but understand its a long term investment of at least a year
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:25:50
The last btc will be mined around the year 2140.
Miners also receive transaction fees associated with each block. As block rewards become insignificant miners will drop out which will lower difficultly and allow remaining miner to get larger rewards and fees. 
The problem will happen when there are not enough miners left to properly secure the network. We have plenty of time to figure that out. If we are still using bitcoin in 2140 that is. My guess is we will have a better technology take over much earlier than that so this is honestly a non-issue.
