Are you suggesting that an anti-government 'bias' is somehow an inextricable aspect of bitcoin?
If so, then I don't agree.  My first interest in bitcoin was wanting a way to break the strangle-hold of the credit-card companies and banks on merchant payment.  I'm not a merchant but I feel bad that they lose so much to their payment provider.
That doesn't even make me anti-corporate.  I have nothing against corporations that provide a reasonable service for a reasonable price as determined by real competition.
I think it could be limiting for bitcoin to unnecessarily associate itself with a political 'bias'.

IMO, this doesn't really inject a new viewpoint.
I've always found the bitcoin crowd to be anti-government, and I think that is the main message of cartoon.

It's good for bitcoin in that it brings people with those leanings to bitcoin, but it could be bad for bitcoin if it becomes to closely associated with it, because that could turn off people who are not of that mindset.  
Same way that the silkroad thing helped launch bitcoin, but was also potentially damaging to bitcoin's image and long-term growth.

In my country (Canada) the merchants cared enough to bring a suit to fight the ridiculous conditions imposed by the credit card companies that prevent any competition between payment methods, eg. they must charge the same regardless of whether the customer pays cash or with a premium card.
They lost, but they cared enough to try.
