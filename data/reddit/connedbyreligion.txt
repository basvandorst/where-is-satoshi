I'm a PHP/mysql developer, and you are the moron. There are tons of huge systems built on LAMP.

That's pure bullshit. I can spin up a thousand servers on AWS in a matter of minutes.
Tech companies do implement crazy high-scale projects all the time.
Just because some exchanges suck, doesn't mean there's no way to properly run them.

I hope it's not all in one wallet.

But if the company doesn't keep logs of who is who due to its policy, then it doesn't matter.

That's my point. Why would a 210 minimum order even exist?
If he set the 210 maximum buy order, he should've still gotten the under 190 deal, not 210 (unless bitstamp gives you the worst possible deal and takes the spread).

Maybe you should provide some, you know, facts, to prove him wrong. 
Oh wait, you can't, everything he said is actually correct.

But those magical Wall st guys would be bound by the same theorem.

I hope they used bitcoins in that transaction.

You're off by a factor of more than 1000. Even in 2010 orders took under 1/1000th of a second to execute:
[NYSE Arca Achieves Sub-Millisecond Speed for Order Execution](
and the latency is measured in microseconds (millionth of a second):
[Trading microseconds for nanoseconds](


Consider that you have no clue about how NYSE works. 
All transactions have been done in memory for decades.
Even cheap consumer SSDs are capable of 100,000 iops.
Fusion-IO SSDs in RAID are [capable]( of 1 BILLION iops.
Which makes you wrong again by a factor of 1,000 to 10,000 at the very least.

I found CampBX allows check payments from verified accounts:
0.55% trade fee
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:34:54
That was my point. But you still didn't explain why he got the 210 transaction when there were cheaper bitcoins available.
@_date: 2013-04-01 08:29:33
New to bitcoin. 
At 60 GH/s, how many bitcoins would one expect to mine per month right now?

He called all php/mysql developers morons.
I wouldn't write a trading system in PHP/mysql, but it can probably be done with the right architecture.
@_date: 2013-10-24 14:45:17
Ok, you're right, but in any functioning trading system any bids higher than asks should be instantly executed and now even show up in the order table.

Notice how you quickly changed the subject from the theorem thing. 
I'm not saying AWS/cloud is the solution. It was just a response to a stupid statement that regular people cannot provide the infrastructure that Wall st guys do. That's pure bullshit. 
Google, for instance, started in a basement. Now they have the most powerful datacenters in the world, and they do care about latency a lot.
There's nothing special about Wall st tech. They are willing to throw a lot of money to improve performance, but so do hundreds of corporations.
Airline companies do have a very high-throughput transactional system.

Do a high resolution scan, if you can. 4800 dpi would be great.

That's why some businesses will charge you less if you pay with cash.

Wait, there are minimum buy orders now? Why would that even exist?
