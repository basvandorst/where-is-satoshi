The founders were nothing but statists, after they came to power. This is what power does to you. They were essentially anarchists, before they gave the power of theft to the newly created federal government. This is always, always the beginning of the end. The power to steal from the population, with a threat of force, leads to everything else. One day, mankind will realize this.

Tell me why I would ever want to use Bitcoin? It's less convenient, slower, more risky.
In fact, the market has spoken: Bitcoin has been adopted by 
1) people doing illegal stuff, for obvious reasons and 
2) speculators who expect Bitcoin price to magically rise to some arbitrary number. There is virtually no one using it for legitimate economic transactions." -RedditUser: ButtBernanke

@_date: 2015-06-27 01:56:39
Naziism absolutely is statism.


The video 'the lion' was primarily focused on hating 'immigrants' which essentially means anyone who lives outside of your states iron gate. The state, divides us all into little spots... each surrounded by an iron gate. They attempt to structure the perfect little tax farm. You and I are the tax cattle, and the members of the state are the farmers. 
Well, the wealthier nations in Europe and Canada for example... draw in 'immigrants' due to their welfare state. When things start turning sour as far as the economy is concerned... people look for reasons why their lives are being affected. They don't look at the fucked up laws, regulation, and restrictions put on the market by the state... they 1st look at immigrants because they feel it is an instant fix to their financial woes. They feel the immigrants are bleeding their utopia dry and they must be done away with.
Now, what's interesting about this is that the welfare state, at least in the US, is a drop in the bucket... in the literal sense... when yiu compare it to corporate welfare. Corporate welfare is absolutely massive... the middle class is always the ones getting fucked the hardest... never the wealthy. The poor also get fucked pretty hard due to inflation which steals the tiny bit of money they do have... a little at a time.. every day. This also effects the middle class as.well... but in terms of scale... the poor get prison raped.
The state, the existence of the state, which is simply the ruling class... has no legitimate rigjt to exist and no legitimate right to impose their law with a threat of force over anyone... especially in terms of north america. We can discuss this later.
Now, the state doesn't give a fuck about you, your family, or those you care about. They just need you to keep farming. They need a revenue stream to keep flowing in so that they can use you as collateral to borrow from their central bank. They of course borrow in the name of the unborn tax payer, to fund war mostly, and distribute the remaining scraps to the poor after they have made their massive amount of profit.
As this massive tangled web of shit is woven, they see this hate for people who live outside the wall and immigrate to the inside, grow at a dramatic rate(this has been going on in the US for years now... you wouldn't believe the hate I hear from people towards Mexican immigrants who pick their extremely cheap produce). They don't give a fuck. They just need you to farm, the tax. Regular people view the ruling class... as an act of G-d. Meaning, government has and will always exist. "Without them, who would build the roads?" Everything is built by market... but people are convinced... due to their own extreme short sightedness... that certain products must be monopolized... like roads. If they aren't monopolized... they simply could not exist.
This of course is complete bullshit....and this way of thinking exists primarily due to state indoctrination from a very young age, which takes.place in public indoctrination camps..IE... public schools.
I like to pose a questions to people who think the state must exist... those who ask " without government who build build X"... the question is as follows:
"Without the slaves, who would pick the cotton?"
We all know how this ended in the southern united states. As soon as the state, who deemed slavery legal, got the fuck out of the way and allowed the market to enter... the immoral problem of slavery was replaced by moral market driven solutions in the form of magical robots that run up and down fields... picking and planting crops.
My points is... the immoral problem, referred to as the state, must be done away with. Allow the market to replace all their bullshit, and the hatred they willingly create.
Free the market, free the world.
Note: sorry for spelling errors. I'm on my phone.
The state attempts to keep the cattle as happy as they can, while maximizing profits. This has always included a welfare state. As immigrants come into the farm, use the welfare state to their advantage... people don't hate the state... they hate the poor immigrants for fucking up their little false utopia. 
The state, which only exists due to violence (taxation), breeds violence. Violence begets violence. The state is violence... and must be done away with.

Rape has been around for thousands of years also. Should you not personally hope that rape, one day, is no more?
Right now, in this reality, all of your income 'taxes' are used to pay the interest on the national debt which was accumulated by creating global conflict/war and making its investors(the central bank) more wealth.
Probably 90% of all your other 'taxes' are used for corporate welfare. 
Case in point: Giving a constant revenue stream to a small group of people(government) controlled by an even smaller group of people(central bankers) is a recipe for disaster. It's all playing out right before your eyes.

As you very clearly laid out, these branches were kept separate for a reason, to prevent abuse and corruption. It is clear, as was inevitable, these preventative measures have failed. Your system has failed. Democracy is and always was a lie.
There is no need to tear anything down, as it will crumble from the inside out.
I think, in the end, the believers in the system were right. Freedom is not free. Resources, and lots of them, need to be invested to keep systems like democracy and it's parasitic ruling class from coming to power. Democracy is structured so that members of this parasitic class are brought to power by believers in the system, to prevent parasitic politicians from coming to power. The fallacy truly knows no bounds.

Having your own mail servers has nothing to do with smtp. This is what I am trying to point out. When you try to send email outside of your organization, or receive email from the internet, this is when smtp comes into play.
I apologize for the confusion.
'Small business smtp' makes no sense and has no definition. Using this term is kind of like saying 'small business UPS'... UPS makes no distinction between small and large business. They deliver to whoever, whenever. Only difference is the size of the truck.


I promise you do. You are either relaying mail via smtp service installed on one of your local exchange servers, or through an on site smtp device that handles both your incoming/outgoing mail(cisco ironport, sendmail, pineapp, **gasp**::barracuda)

@_date: 2015-06-15 00:23:18
Smtp is a protocol in which you use to transfer email from one system to another. It is a protocol that is utilized by a device that normally sits at the 'edge'  of a network. You can setup most email systems to perform smtp directly... but this is not normally done as it opens your sever up to massive security and spam vulnerabilities. You would want an actual mail filter to handle your smtp traffic...for example a sendmail/pineapp/ironport device or cluster of devices depending on volume. These devices are solely responsible for both incoming and outgoing mail to and from your internal mail system.
People who host there own mail systems, even small business who host there own mail systems will simply piggy back off of their isp's smtp servers by setting them up as a relay device.
Smtp traffic is a world in its own so to speak and large enterprises have completely different groups to manage and maintain both the external (smtp) and internal (usually exchange) mail systems.

@_date: 2015-06-18 03:51:48


Absolutely.... but I did want to 'gently' describe mining to them because miners are at the core of the ecosystem. I found this explanation below... something like this should suffice.
"So the basic concept of Bitcoin mining is that there’s a little chunk of each block that contains meaningless random data, and Bitcoin miners take all the data in the current block, shuffle up that random chunk and calculate the hash of the whole thing.  Remember that while hashes are easy to reproduce, they’re impossible to predict and they seem to function completely randomly, so the miner has no way of predicting what chunk of random data will produce what hash, he just has to keep changing that chunk until he gets the result he’s looking for. Eventually, some miner somewhere finds a chunk of random data that produces a hash that is smaller than a certain value, as determined by the difficulty, and submits this block and its accompanying hash to the Bitcoin network. Once the network confirms the solution is correct, the miner is rewarded with a number of Bitcoins."
Note: I'm presenting to IT people.... not just the regular joe. Any chance you can expand on the quote? I'm not completely clear on, at a low level, how the miners solve/open/create a block. I'd like to use the correct terminology as well...

Network engineering.
Anyone, anywhere has the natural right to use value they have legitimately acquired in any way they see fit as long as it is not directly harming another individual. The state, and the voter have no right to forcibly steal money from private individuals via taxation (theft). This is the ground level discussion concerning the illegitimate existence of government, anywhere.
We could also discuss how the state in North america, murdered the indigenous people's and then imposed it's rules upon everyone else. They don't have any legitimate claim over the land in which they impose their rules, with violence.... let alone not having a right to steal from people.
If you ever ponder what life would be like without the state, and have that shiver of the unknown run down your spine... remember this. Many times throughout US history... plantation and slave owners asked abolitionists.... "without the slaves would would pick the cotton?"
The extreme immorality(and inefficiency) of slavery had to end. When it did, the market provideo a moral(and 10000x more efficient) alternative. This is how the state will go one day.
The inefficiency and violence of the largest monopoly mankind has ever known will one day cease to exist.....especially it's monopoly on force.

There is a reason that cables are used to connect continents... it's called bandwidth and lan level latency via fiber. You simply cannot achieve low latency and massive amounts of bandwidth with satellites. If you have ever been in a datacenter, all the racks full of various devices are glorified paper weights without the fiber connecting them to the switching infrastructure.

It's funny, people were so blinded by their greed they left all their eggs in one basket, a basket handled by retarded little kids who liked to 'tap' magic cards. Also, people are so blinded by their greed, they seem to forget that a very violent, coercive entity known as the state, still exists. One of the major reasons gox happened, is the lack of competition. People want to open exchanges, but the massive amounts of regulation/red tape/tax shit that are involved is the biggest road block. Same people who beg for additional exchanges, are the ones 'voting' for regulation. Keep on voting, statists.

 Keep this in mind.
If you just bought your 1st whole bitcoin, you spent $500 and change. If bitcoin completely tanks, which it won't, you would be out $500. Money comes in, money goes out. This is life. You will tell yourself many times throughout life "its always something". Be happy, that you have an opportunity like you have at hand. If only I had someone like this around when I was young(I'm 31). When I used to hide in my room, building pcs and doing all kinda shit online, I would have been invovled in bitcoin a lot earlier and already have made a lot of money. You should feel honored though, as I do, that you are alive to experience something like bitcoin. Can you imagine what else is coming? Holy. Fuck. The world, life, people... all of it is about to change... for the better.

This is an assumption. Demand may decrease in the short term, but i'm always trying to figure out what is going to happen in the long run.


Also an assumption. When were most recreational drugs banned? After you look it up, you will most likely discover you weren't alive at that time. Having said that, how could you know if the demand for drugs stayed the same at that time, and the supply decreased?
When I was growing up, the demand for drugs was absolutely massive... and they flowed, literally.. like water... especially ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana.  This was in the southern united states. Different time periods, and in different areas, the demand goes up and down...as does the supply. The supply cannot be calculated like any other product the market supplies. This isn't a universal supply/demand graph you can apply nationwide.

Mtgox was a group of fat fvcks who sold trust. When they sold enough trust, they could use the money to tap eachothers cards. Once tapped, they could double tap peoples minds into purchasing more trust. They kept buying trust from the fat fvcks  until all cards had been untapped and the little bastards ran away into magic land giggling like school girls.

Hell, the feds should have insured goxcoins with fiat, which is backed by no real value whatsoever but seems to make people feel secure. All of what I have just said, makes perfect sense.

Create an offline paper wallet by going to bitcoinpaperwallet.com and ordering the integrated ubuntu live cd. Print the wallet which contains the private/public key. Print at least 3 of them. Laminate them. Store safely at multiple locations. Login to your coinbase account and send your newly purchased bitcoins to the address you generated offline, via the bitcoinpaperwallet live cd.

But I wouldn't refer to them as 'limits'. It's just coercion, plain and simple. Government can do whatever the fuck they want when they want to do it, but you cannot leave the tax farm with more than X amount of dollars when you feel the need to do it. This is why they dislike bitcoin.

I think what this guy is trying to say(from what he has gathered from one of his IT buddies or read in magazines) while he makes a very bad attempt to sound smart, is simply that you can block protocols via firewalls, or implement a WAF(web application firewall) which is an OSI layer 7 firewall, not just a layer 4 like traditional firewalls. What he doesn't seem to understand is that global communications are not a LAN, it's a WAN, and there is no fucking way you can simply start blocking entire protocols without fucking everything else up. There, I hope I helped the people on the board trying to understand the vague posts from this asshat trying to sound intelligent.

Anything aside from outright theft would be fantastic to use towards building things. Keep in minds, roads are extremely expensive and the only reason there are so many is because they are viewed as being 'cheap' by the public due to the nature of the way they are funded(theft). Without mass theft(the state) we would have far less roads, which is fantastic because we would also probably have had flying cars 10 yrs ago. Who the fuck knows what mankind would have right now without the regulation(guns) of the state to hinder innovation.
When will mankind learn.

If you tried to harm someone around me, or someone I knew that was in my inner circle... I would defend them, because I am a human being.
I would help/defend a woman if I saw someone raping her or attempting to rape her. Why? Because I am a human being. 
No one on planet earth, has the natural right to harm, hurt, rape, murder or steal from anyone else. If you believe you do, you simply have the proverbial gun.
'Authority' for example... doesn't actually exist. The gun and the sword exist. If you believe you have authority over anyone or anything, you just have the ability to use violence against them to force them to do whatever it is you want them to do.


This happens now, every single day, in every society on earth. Who would bring you to justice now? You are going in a different direction than what we were originally discussing.

While we'll just agree to disagree, the point you are missing is that the government solves problems with violence. Plain and simple. They have an unjust monopoly on force and can assault, kidnap and lock you in a cage whenever they like. They have no legitimate claim over the land in which they violently impose their laws over peaceful people. They use money's stolen from the unwilling, especially the unborn (borrowing money from a Central bank at the expense of the unborn) to fund war and murder around the planet while being the earth's largest arms dealer at my expense. I have no choice, no real choice of not funding the sociopaths and their wars.

It's not about what I do or don't like, it's about what is moral/immoral. It is also about what the market can do as they always do, which is to provide a better product at a lower cost. It is about limiting market forces and convincing you, through public indoctrination camps, that without the giant monopoly of the state...."who would build the roads?"
The market would build them, and we would all have options. Fact is, people, are terrified of the unknown.
I will leave you with one thought:
In the 1800's, when abolitionists were telling plantation owners that slavery must end because it is immoral and disgusting.... the plantation owners asked:
"Without slaves, who would pick the cotton?"
We all know how this ended. The gun of the state got out of the way, and the market was allowed to enter, replacing the immoral practice of slavery with magical robot machines that run up and down fields... picking and planting everything that can grow.

Public knowledge? 1/10 people have heard of bitcoin. How many have actually used bitcoin in any capacity? Have you had conversations with people, who you consider to be bright, and witness their minds bending as you explain what bitcoin is and why they need it? I have. Many times.
I would equate it with the image from the redhat bitcoin knock off video of the Wright brothers launching their 1st flying machine. Do you think 99.99999% of the planet gave a shit that they launched a flying machine? Probably not, nor did they even notice.

Can you murder me and my family? Sure, you could. The concept of self ownership is the understanding that I have the natural right to defend myself and my family, with force. You would be the aggressor, I would justifiably defend myself and my family from your initiation of force.
The state doesn't recognize your right to defend yourself, your family, your property(taxation) or use your body in whatever way you see fit(drug use, prostitution).
Example: 'Prostitution'(direct, un-taxed payment for sexual favors) is prohibited by the state. Pornography is not(licensing/taxation are involved)
The war on drugs has been raging for what, 80 yrs? Do you believe the state doesn't simply convince the public, through indoctrination, to allow them to continue to borrow from central banks to fund the war on drugs? Legalized drug use for all is certainly not in the best interest of the state. Firstly, it is difficult to near impossible to collect tax on drugs, especially those that can be grown in a basement. Second, and most important, drugs alter your mind from doing what the state has programmed us all to do....focus on the production and consumption of goods and services.
The mass production and consumption of goods and services is the 'oil to the machine' of a society based on inflation. Spend, spend spend. Borrow, borrow borrow. 
The state realized long ago, that direct enslavement wasn't productive... so they switched to a different model. Giving you just enough 'rights' to make you 'happy'.

The state will not dissolve by simply doing away with the purchase of energy. Machinery/energy storage devices are still needed which requires manufacturing. It will hurt the state, but it will take a massive effort to due away with it altogether. Example... stop using their currency. Completely. They will simply go away if everyone did so at once.

Human beings like to feel good, on an individual basis. This is the foundation of 'selfishness' as other people who are also selfish by nature use as a label. Everything that everyone does, does so in their own interest.
People who do good things for others, are doing those things on their own behalf, because it makes them feel good. People don't give money to charity for the sake of others, they do so because 1st and foremost it makes them feel good personally to do so.
That being said, when you take away the 'feel good' feeling people have towards something that they have held positive feelings for, for a very long time, it really messes with their head. Why? Admitting to yourself that something that has made you feel good for a very long time, is actually not good or terrible, is VERY painful.
Most cannot admit to themselves that tax is theft, and not only theft but theft with a threat of being assaulted, kidnapped and being thrown in a cage like an animal. This is exactly why the state uses euphemisms to describe its own practices, because they do not desire to use words that hold negative connotations. For Example:
Quantitative Easing = inflation(negative connotation)
Arrest = Assault(negative connotation)
Arrest = Kidnapping(negative connotation)
Jail/Prison = Rape Cage(they are cages, where you have an extremely high probability of being raped)
Fine = Extortion(negative connotation)
The state loves their euphemisms, because words that hold a negative connotation are only applied to the public, not the government. The government can do no wrong.
Take my father for example, his entire life he admired John Wayne and Abraham Lincoln. He is 60 yrs old now. My brother bought him a few books about John Wayne and Lincoln showing that both were complete fucking scumbags. It took him a while to agree to read them, and after he did he was extremely upset and angry. Eventually he came to terms with the fact that those men he once admired were in fact, scumbags.
It is very painful to admit to ones self that things that have made us feel good our entire lives, are actually fucking terrible. The state indoctrinates us all from a very young age, whether you go to public school or not. You are heavily indoctrinated. Most all of us were forced to worship a towel, every morning. Pledging our allegiance to a piece of cloth. What does that cloth represent? Why would you pledge your allegiance to anyone or anything?
Going back to the part about admiring others, which is an entire conversation in itself, I believe the reason that men desire to look up to other men/women as 'heroes' is because they/we are too terrified to look for heroism in ourselves.... which is a very sad state of affairs.

Congratulations my friend. With you being just 14 yrs old, and in the bitcoin space as a developer is extremely impressive.
My advice to you: Keep in mind why bitcoin was created, why the thought of crypto crossed peoples minds before bitcoins inception. It was created to set people free from the chains of state controlled, and corrupted, currency. You are obviously a very bright young mind, and as you come up you will be surrounded by people who look to corrupt bitcoin in the same way, for their own shallow financial gain.
For my sake and the sake of the unborn, don't allow yourself to be swallowed up by the status quo which is centralized power and centralized institutions.

Ok, I see what you are saying. Let me explain your assumption. You assumed, based on me posting in this thread which exists on the bitcoin board, that my 'currency' of choice would avoid theft. I never stated this, you assumed this. Can you use bitcoin to avoid theft? Absolutely. Is it being done right now? Absolutely. Will I use it whenever I can to avoid sales theft? Absolutely.... but this was never my point. My hope is for crypto/bitcoin to further undermine the crippling power of the state... and let me say, more than a little of its power if derived from its monopoly on currency.
There are man, many, many forms of 'tax'... 
I'd also like to add, if the world went 'full-bitcoin' then the state would not have the ability to print bitcoin out of thin air. How do you think war is funded? Tax? Sorry to say, no. It's funded via inflation and the ability to set any number they please in various bank accounts and dumping the interest and responsibility of paying it back to an entity made up of foreign banksters on the unborn.
If the world went 'full bitcoin' state funded war would end. Why? They would actually have to ask 'citizens' to pay for it.

do you define your own morality by what is legal/illegal? If so, you agree with north Korean and middle eastern 'law' and every law in the US that is beyond fucked up. You also would have agreed with it being illegal to hide Jews in your walls in Nazi Germany, and the act of actually being Jewish as being illegal and punishable by death.
I linked you 'the law' for a reason. Not for my own health.

1st world countries/governments in many cases either do not want, or are quite happy with beautiful third world countries being quite poor... This is the way most 1st world governments like it.
America for example. American investors who build a lot of the resorts/attractions in the island nations can keep their costs down in terms of labor... which keeps the cost down for the american tourists. The more tourists, the more resources the state receives... on both sides. As quality of life rises in these countries, cost of vacationing there goes up as well and the state loses that revenue stream on both sides. 'Both' being critical. The us government doesn't like revenue streams going down, and will disincentive foreign governments from policy which would drive up quality of life in 'their' countries.... probbably by simply paying them directly or indirectly.
I can't prove most of this of course, but to me it is pretty obvious.

How could the government allow this to happen? They are the ones the public elected to protect them from such things... and paid them with money forcibly taken from them. This cannot be. Government officials are very smart, they graduate from prestigious universities with degrees as professional students. This is simply unthinkable. Something must change. 
The public needs to clean house, and elect new professional students. Young men and women, who think differently, but graduated from the same universities and never having run their own business, but can promise fixes to national and global economic problems. This is what needs to take place. We can fix this, with real change. Change which stems from fresh ideas, from problem solvers who have never solved anyone's problems, not even their own.
All hale change. All hale the state.

What buyer protection are you after? The online stores I purchase products from offer their own buyer protection.
The reason credit card companies/banks offer buyer protection for credit cards is because they understood from the beginning how terrible the entire idea was/is. Also, they offer the level of protection they do due to the amount of money being made to process transactions.
Bitcoin is a push, not a pull like a credit card is. If someone steals your bitcoin account, it is because you don't understand what you are doing. If someone steals your cc, it's because you left your wallet somewhere or gave every bit of your information related to the card to a faceless name on the interwebz.

1.6mb in 1.5 years time


on a desktop. 


You claim 32mb blocks would be the 'technical maximum' for a desktop, and then allude to this fact that this size is so large, more than likely they would need to be run in 'compute clusters'(i'll assume you meant computer clusters) in a datacenter.
I'll point out a few things:
1: I, and many people I know have external storage in the form of NAS/iSCSI. You act as though if the drives cannot be housed inside the 'desktop' itself, then it is simply too complex and/or will price folks who want/desire to run a full node out of the market. This is of course ridiculous, and you are full of shit.
2: I will put money on the fact that you have never stepped foot in a datacenter, as no one who actually works in the industry and/or knows their ass from a hole in the ground, uses a term like 'computer cluster'. Some of us, do work in the industry, and do work in data centers.

The system was designed, by Satoshi, to hard fork. You know this to be true. If the system must fork to survive/scale, it will fork. The entity that designed the system wasn't apprehensive about a fork, which is why it was made very clear to be a viable options repeatedly by the creator of the system itself.
Your fear of a fork, doesn't negate any of those facts. I would also add, you don't have any 'facts' to back up your fear. You only have speculation and conjecture, exacerbated by a small group whom you look to as the 'experts'.

Know how your dollars controlled by your government which are backed by the US dollar can be frozen/stolen by the banks/government at any time without notice? Bitcoin is the reverse. It cannot be stolen/frozen if used/stored appropriately. You are the bank.
Know how your dollar, which is backed by the US dollar, is worth about 24% less than the US dollar at this point in time? Bitcoin is the reverse. 5 years ago a bitcoin was worthless. Today one bitcoin is worth 280 us dollars.
Know how your dollar which is controlled by your government, which is backed by the us dollar, and worth far less than the us dollar and is also be created out of thin air by your government and the us government?

This is exactly why I said we should come to an agreement on what the state actually is.
I define the state quite differently, but in very simple terms.
The State, is, a person or group of people; who's monopoly on force is not only legitimate, but necessary, for society to function.
Anyone, or any group, who claims that their violence which always begins with taxation is legitimate, and necessary for society to function... will end up the same way, every time. It is not a question of if, but when. It takes time but will, and always has broken down. It's time to try something new. 
Why do I fully believe anarchy and spontaneous order will ultimately work out and place all human beings into their natural state? Due to the fact no one, anywhere, has to believe in it. It just is.
@_date: 2015-07-13 22:38:38
I do not judge those who were indoctrinated in public camps like I was...but I do hold those accountable for their actions once they have been presented with the idea that the state can only exist via theft, and reject it. Theft is violence. Violence (non self defense) is immoral and/or unethical. 
The immoral idea of the state is reaching it's end thanks to global communications. Without the internet I would still be a statist. Yes, I was once a hard core statist. Then I allowed myself to expand my intellectual boundaries.

It's a lottery system. When you buy a lottery ticket, you have no idea what the numbers are going to be... you just pick and hope you win. Miners are doing the same thing, but billions and billions of times, and someone eventually gets the correct numbers. When you do achieve the correct numbers, you are rewarded with 25 bitcoin... and another page is added to the public ledger.


One can, easily... but who is going to use it? The bitcoin network, and it's ledger is referred to as the 'blockchain'. It's just that... a chain of 'blocks'. Each block stores data, primarily in the form of bitcoin transactions. Every transaction that has ever taken place is accounted for, and cannot be altered. The size of the network makes it more secure. The network grows as the price and usability grows.


back to the blockchain... whoever(miners/mining pools) wins the lottery gets 25 btc as a reward, and a page(block) is added to the public ledger(block chain) where transactions are written into the public ledger. Q3 of next year, the reward for winning the lottery will be cut in half to 12.5btc to lower inflation. Only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist... but keep in mind, one bitcoin is divisible into 100million units(8 decimal places) referred to as 'satoshis'.

The United States has never been in a legitimate war, aside from the war with england of course... in which the colonists went to war over a 3% tax on tea, which instantaneously turned into a 27% tax on whiskey after it had been won... and Washington murdered people to enforce it.


There are millions who do not agree with any war, for moral and non moral reasons. They have no choice but to continue to fund it, or face being thrown into a cage. This is your definition of society.

I simply know for a fact, that the state is force and violence. We were all taught(most of us anyway) that you don't solve your problems in life with violence. The state, the idea of the state, is violence.... beginning with taxation, which is force. It is just an idea, like authority. They both do not exist, they are just an idea that need to be legitimized by 50% +1. Democracy is no better than the state or authority. It is also violence, and a lie. Your vote means nothing.

Also taxing farmers? Really?
So pretty much there is little to no way the economy can possibly recover, given that the austerity measures are pretty much going to chase away tourists and burden farmers to the point they can't make a profit and therefore developing out their exports industry will be neigh impossible.
How exactly does EU expect Greece to be able to recover their economy so as to be able pay any of this back?
I suspect they are not expected to. **I have a funny feeling they are expected to try and fail again and each time they do they will be forced to sell off more of their sovereign land ports and islands to international creditors.

Satoshi didn't 'give' anyone the right to do anything. Satoshi provided code, and a vision for how he/she/it/they would like to see it evolve. That's it.
The original block size was 32mb, and was slammed down to 1mb as a ~~permanant~~ temporary solution to a possible attack on the network.


again, Satoshi wnted the network to be open, available, and cheap to everyone. He/she/it/they wanted to see it reach 'visa' levels one day.


Again, who gave you, a few core devs, or blockstream jurisdiction over what kind of transaction needs priority?


Decentralized mining and competition amongst miners has nothing to do with keeping transactions flowing. If the mem pool is saturated, you can have 100x the hashing power the currently exists and it won't speed up the process. You want to keep denying this, but the memory pool has been saturated, heavily, and its taken transactions days and even weeks to confirm. After a fork, and the network is saturated once again(we hope because that means growth), what % of the transactions will you or blockstream identity of spam or transactions that do not deserve priority? I'd like to know.
 &gt; The lightning network is not functional
he LN does. not. exist.


Artificially limiting the network, when a 1mb increase will not harm anyone, is what's overblown. Stop. Artificially. Limiting. the. Network.


You/blockstream, define 'right'? No, the majority does. If not, you have centralized control/development. Pick your poison. Also, when it forks, you can stay on the old chain and miners who agree with you can mine the old chain.


They absolutely are and many examples can be shows to prove that the most vocal core devs are opposed. They have also dug their own grave by spreading so much fear about a hard fork killing the system entirely. As Classic nears, the price is dropping due to people and investors being afraid of a hard fork. As the price drops, the miners are even more so willing to run classic and fork to a new chain. Core tried their best, and had a pretty amazing FUD campaign I have to admit. 


That's fine. Let it fork. Let Satoshi's design to show everyone it will work as designed, and let the cap be increased by 100% which allows the network to grow by 100% as far as transactions. This will also increae the reward for miners, whether or not you or other devs want to identity transactions as spam or 'low priority'.


I've already stated this one, i'll do it again. Segwit will only increase the blocksize to 1.6mb, and will take minimum of 9 months, most likely much more... because no one knows exactly how to go about implementing it network wide. This is a fact. Core could always just softfork it in whenever they please I guess, if you like that sort of thing which many do because they like centralized authority.


Ever run a business before? or worked for a growing business? These are called growing pains, and they are a good thing. Don't artificially limit your business because a solution to your problems, that doesn't exist, might come later. That's just dumb, and you will end up going out of business.


If you believe the whitepaper created boundaries, you must believe in the constitution and law.
"But whether the Constitution really be one thing, or another, this much is certain - that it has either authorized such a government as we have had, or has been powerless to prevent it. In either case it is unfit to exist."
Paper doesn't limit anything or anyone. Paper never has, and paper never will. Ever. 


Confirmed. You do believe in paper. I'm sorry.


You or blockstream defining 'adequate' is again, centralized control/development. The consensus will define that term and all others. Not you or blockstream. This may be painful, but it is reality.


They have already violated the essence of bitcoin itself. Decentralization.


Again, it doesn't matter what you believe or blockstream believes.


You have most definitely not come off as rude. Most likely I have because i'm repeating myself. You have been a breath of fresh air.

Ok 


Do you feel a transaction backlog, at times, of tens of thousands of transactions means its time to increase the block size?


No one, not even the most prominent devs know how exactly how this is going to be rolled out nor how long it will take. I've read it'll take about 1.5 yrs to be fully integrated into the network as a whole. It will increase the blocksize to 1.6mb when fully functional. 1.5 yrs for a .6mb increase, when you can simply bump the blocksize to 2mb and hard fork in a month. 


Payment channels as in, the lightning network? You can't implement that 1st, because it doesn't exist. If 2mb is not reasonable, what do you define as reasonable?


No, classic is just a client. Just like core. The entities who have commit access within core, try to softfork everything so they don't need to take a vote. You seem to be missing this.
If the devs who have commit access within classic, try to softfork changes in that people don't want like core devs have(RBF) then the system needs to fork away from classic as well.
Core is the biggest threat to bitcoin, and can be forked away from like any other client.

Did Satoshi give you or anyone else ultimate jurisdiction over what is to be determined as a low quality transaction? Because that's not the bitcoin I signed up for, that is for sure.


The point of forking away from core isn't only to due away with an artificial limit to the network, it is also to prove that a hard fork isn't dangerous and that the design put in place by the creator itself will work as designed. You have been led to believe that a hard fork, which was designed by Satoshi, has the ability to cripple bitcoin entirely.


I completely agree.... but proposing solutions to a problem in the form of something that doesn't exist is beyond silly, I would hope you would agree. I can tell you the solution to fossil fuels is teleportation via on demand worm holes, but it doesn't solve the problem... and the funny thing is, worm holes actually exist.


The average blocksize is hitting the ceiling. Bumping the blocks to 2mb, by your own admission, will in no way cause a problem... except for core because it will require a hard fork.


Bitcoin has been in the wild for 7 yrs. 7 years at 1mb. How long is a 'fair go'?


This is where i'm comfortable in telling you that you are wrong. Anyone can be a core developer. If you write code, and submit it and it is integrated into core, you are a core developer. The same applies to any client. The only difference is who has commit access. Consensus is not redefined when bitcoin moves from client to client. The rules all remain the same. I'll promise you this, if classic tries to soft fork shit in as core developers have done and plan to do again, another fork needs to take place to get away from it as well.


Everything, in bitcoin is already up for vote. This is how the system was designed. I would like to add, if bitcoin forks, there is nothing forcing anyone to use a certain chain. Exchanges, miners, wallets will use the most valuable chain.
I think you need to understand, if everything is not up for 'vote' then bitcoin is centrally controlled. Central control is what backs a centrally planned economy. The facade of democracy has always been bullshit, I think you would agree.
I also would like to thank you for being quite reasonable, and not taking the same path most do on this sub... which usually results in name calling and personal attacks. This has been a breath of fresh air.

this plays into the concept of self ownership, and property. You have the right to defend your own property, if acquired legitimately... but as I stated, the definition of property is widely disputed. Things aren't as cut and dry as you think. Philosophy is very, very important. Once you dive into the philosophical realm, you start to question yourself at every turn... until you come to very firm conclusions.

Coming after people is very, very expensive. I just wanted to point out the fact that having a CC tied to your account doesn't protect Uber in any way. How much do you think they will spend to get their 20$?
I user Uber a lot. I can see this taking place. They will require riders paying with BTC to enter a destination address, this will not be an option as with a CC, so that they can closely calculate the charge based on the travel path/time of day/traffic patterns. The btc address you tie to your account will be checked for available funds before the driver can pick you up.
They could also require riders who pay in BTC to simply deposit a set amount of btc at the time of request, and the driver will pick you up as long as the amount has been deposited and the destination address has been set. Any amount over the charge, they simply issue change to whatever address you have linked in your Uber profile or a separate change address you specify.
I would also like to point out that if you have a CC that cannot be charged, they always have the option to simply suspend your account... which would most likely be the case.

If a dude punched my wife in the face while we were out and about, and I started beating the ever loving shit out of the person, the police officer would stop the fight and assault us both.... especially if there were not any witnesses.
Now, the real point. Police officers, are funded by theft. It is no different than mafia 'protection services' back in the day. You know, sometimes the mafia actually provided protection... but forced you to pay either way. If you didn't, they would kick the shit out of you. The government is the mafia, no difference aside from the fact the government has flags and badges and is a much larger group of people. 
Now, if you can let your anger go for just a few seconds, I can explain the concept of self ownership to you. 
Who owns you? Your actual body? If you say you, well, the state doesn't agree. They own you. Which is why they can tell you not to smoke/eat a certain leaf(weed) but you can smoke another leaf(tobacco). If you have a certain type of salad on you, they think they have the right to assault you, kidnap you and put you in a cage and then extort you for money.
The concept of self ownership simply states you do not have the natural right to initiate force against any other human being unless it is in self defense or defense of others.

You can communicate value(internet is communications) to anyone on the planet in 10 minutes for almost 0 cost.
As others have stated, bitcoin may have no benefit to you(banked north american) at all...but fire may have no benefit to you at all either, when it is absolutely critical for others around the world to survive. When is the last time you needed to, or lit a fire for a functional purpose? You see my point.

I talk about him, a lot. He's someone I think very, very highly of. Why? Because I'm not a statist who legitimizes those who monopolize products and services and murders people, including 'its own citizens' and creates war to appease it's investors IE the central bank. I believe in self ownsership, which means the natural right to do any drug one pleases, and the natural right to commit suicide. I, am an anarchist, which means no rulers. 
I am not a modern day anarchist that sucks the states tit so long as it produces food stamps and minimum wage laws enforced by violence. I believe in natural law and spontaneous order. I believe in humanity, not a small group of sociopaths who easily control the minds of billions and socially organizes us all into classes while making us hate one another.

This will one day happen to legal theft and the immorality of the state. The free market solutions that will replace the state will be mind blowing. The government bread lines, which you call roads will be completely transformed, or.... not used at all.

Unlike gold, I can store bitcoin in my brain and take my brain with me anywhere in the world to use wherever I please.
Unlike gold, I won't get interrogated by criminals as I travel due to the amount of bitcoin I have stored in my brain.
Unlike gold, bitcoin doesn't oppress me via gravity and cause me to  waste precious calories. 
Unlike gold, I have no shipping or transfer fees when I move value within the blockchain to purchase something from anywhere in the world, at any time of day or night.
Unlike gold, legal or illegal thieves cannot steal my value from me. They can torture me, but then they would find out it's a multi sig wallet and the other signees reside outside of the mythical lines called borders.
Unlike gold, I do not have to purchase a large, heavy safe...creating a 'single point of failure' in terms of letting would be thieves know exactly where my value is stored or pay storage fees to a third party, thus wasting my value.

The initiation of force is the exact opposite of self defense.
If no one made the distinction, I hope this is now cleared up for you. When libertarians/anarchists talk about force, they mean the initiation of force.... not force in itself. If someone tries to physically harm you, you have the natural right to defend your own body/property. I would hope you believe this.

Interesting how statists like yourself like to forget that most of the imooral shit that has gone on and continues to go on is legitimized by unjust governments. Which is the nature of a government.


I like how you dodged the question.


The market didn't make slavery more expensive, it made the products the slave owners were producing cheaper... which forced them to adapt. This is what competition does, which is exacrtly what the largest monopoly on the face of the earth(government) has never had to deal with, aside from the mafia... which they seek to destroy and have destroyed. Mafia doesn't like competition from another mafia.


Here it is, the badge of honor. I should copy and paste this sentence from the hundreds of times i've seen it on Usually ends with, "but then I woke up and realized people gotta eat!"




Yea, recognizing rape for what it is, is pretty pointless. In the end, you will be raped. Deal with it.


You and your statist brethren will never accomplish this via the suggestion box for slaves. I promise you that. 


Ad hominem comments towards acts of rape, instead of discussing the acts themselves, doesn't make them any less rape. Human can rationalize anything, and you are a shining example of that.

Bitcoin will grow on its own, it does not need the help of a central marketing organization. It will grow due to millions of people, very selfish people, who strive to develop products and services to benefit mankind for a monetary reward. It will grow organically.

Quick Explanation: Yes, the US Mafia(government) literally 'creates money' out of thin fucking air.... BUT, this is key, they have to be very careful on how much monopoly money they create to avoid hyper inflation which will fuck them as much as it will fuck the average joe.
This is why they also borrow money, from a 3rd party mysterious entity known as 'the federal reserve' which is a pillar of communism... a central bank. This entity, is backed by the people who run the planet, the iron fist behind the invisible hand. Regular folk don't know and will probably never know who they are for sure,  we can only speculate. The people who back this central bank lend money to the US mafia because of 2 reasons:
 Collateral: The US economy and the theft(tax) revenue generated every month.
 The Promise of Perpetual Conflict: The US will create and drag out conflict in every corner of the planet until the end of time, which generates a shit ton of money for its investors(the central bank).
Well, I hope this was helpful.
