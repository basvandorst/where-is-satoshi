Well thanks for the relief. I always use Gemini, but I needed a quicker deposit time so I gave coinbase a try and the first try I have to deal with all this. Ive read all the bad reviews on coinbase about people losing there money, so im glad this probably isn't one of those times.

Like I said i'm not new to bitcoin, just coinbase.

So once I receive the 3 Confirmations it will appear in my blockchain wallet? I read through there "tutorials" and it said that once a transfer is initiated both partys should see the pending (unconfirmed) transfer immediately. But im sure like a lot of things on coinbase, its not true.

just an update, one of my bitcoin transfers( I got $10 friend bonus) went through, but it was the one I sent an hour later? It was the exact same address. The other transfer was a lot more bitcoin, why would they transfer one but not the other, especially the one that was later.

alright guess I probably should of just stuck with Gemini. There transfers usually hit the wallet within 10-20 seconds. I've opened a ticket, but I doubt I hear back from anybody before September.

that's actually great news though cause it must be coinbase then. There bitcoin service status shows as "degraded performance". Have you transferred from coinbase to blockchain wallet before? This is my first time with coinbase.

Im less worried about the confirmations and more worried about the fact that my blockchain wallet shows nothing. is this normal for coinbase?
