I know right? I was like, damn that was fast! lol
@_date: 2013-03-19 07:24:57
Thanks, I'll check it out. I'd like to help any way I can.

I love this idea, please share this on github! I think that if we can spread bitcoin in to the facebook ecosystem for payments in games, or transfer between people that would be huge!
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:35:28
I think it's an improvement, but it still looks like a software website. Not a consumer payment website. I really think we need to have something similar in looks to paypal.com or stripeup.com or even dwolla. This is what people new to bitcoin will generally see for the first time, and I don't think it represents the picture we're trying to portray.  Just my 2 cents.

Support the developers with your coin! They can use your help!

I've seen that and I also am a fan of the unicode character. The only problem for me has been trying to make it in to a memorable logo/icon, that represents the right feeling.  I'm working on a few other variations right now, one with the double vertical bars like the original, and one similar to the ecogex version but with a different font.

I didn't have time to remake the gold coin, and I really don't think we have to get rid of the coin anyway. In my mind the coin works well as an illustration but not as a logo.

Hell yeah it will be responsive!  I don't bother coding anything that's not responsive any more. :)

I was just thinking, why not have a community funded exchange project?  I'm a front-end developer/designer, and am willing to help design the user interface and design elements for the site.  Has anyone here looked in to the LMAX Disruptor, trading platform? 
It's supposed to be the fastest ever, and the code is available on github.

I still want to buy in, I love the idea behind bitcoin, and I'm looking for anyway I can to stick it to the central banking cartel.  I will invest but the question is, this week or next? I'll have access to about $4,000 by tomorrow or monday. I just want to make the best choice. Where would you suggest buying coins from? mtgox?
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:57:11
Thanks! I'm glad you appreciate the work!
@_date: 2013-03-19 07:12:37
This is only after 2 days of work, I intend on getting us a proper bitcoin.org built as well.  Let's outdo paypal and push bitcoin mainstream!
@_date: 2013-03-19 07:51:41
Thanks! lol
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:36:23
I think we also need the site to be responsive, for people accessing it on mobile devices.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:16:49
I'm going to invest in bitcoin no matter what. I just want to be smart about it. I love the idea and I want to support the movement.
@_date: 2013-10-28 09:16:22
You can easily ship through Fedex. And a 7ft tree to most places is around $80 in shipping. We'd be able to charge a little less since the fees are so little with bitcoin.

I like the blue, but I still feel that we need to try to mirror Gold as much as possible, so I'd prefer to try to stick with the gold color. Thanks for the files, I'll look in to possibly using them in a future iteration. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:40:32
I've tried it many different ways, I like the horizontal line as well.  I think that the double vertical bars could work if it was done right, the way it is now I get the same feeling as you that it kind of imparts "bling" or like an online game.
I like the use of italics for this because it's similar to paypal.  I figure that subliminally if we can get people to relate us to paypal which is already established, we might be able to neutralize people's minds to the idea of a virtual currency.
I'm working on a few more variations, one with the double vertical bars, and one not in italic.
I like using the "Ubuntu" font for the logo, but I think you're right we should do it a little more bold.
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:56:42
I've realized that since I put these out there.  It's by no means a finished design.  I'm working on multiple variations of it right now and am trying to get in contact with the bitcoin.org owners.
@_date: 2013-03-19 10:01:12
Thank you! :)

It looks like bitcoinity is just freaking out, jumping up to 225 then back to 190, I'm not sure if it's the market or what's going on.  I just cashed out a few BTC anyway.
@_date: 2013-03-19 10:00:58
If anyone wants to give me some props for this, I just discovered the Reddit bitcoin tip bot a few minutes ago: 1EM8UHC2cHKLy2RRynRf4TvskbdMQPfygV
@_date: 2013-03-19 10:01:54
I'm trying a new version with the vertical line bars.  I'll post updates on the progress.  Thanks for the input!
@_date: 2013-03-19 08:06:42
I too have nostalgia for the old "B" mark, but I still feel that if we care about the longterm success of bitcoin, we need a strong image to market to the public.  We need to be able to compete with sites like Paypal, and stripeup.com. Thanks for your comments, I still have a lot of work to do on this. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:17:08
Thanks so much!
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:58:21
Thanks for these, I like the simplicity of the single line.  I'm back to the drawing board now, but we'll get a good bitcoin.org in no time.
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:47:15
I still feel the dollar B looks to cartoony.  I think it's only the font that does it.  I'm going to keep messing around with it, who knows, it might gain traction.  Thanks for the advice!
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:48:45
I'm a front-end designer, I could easily handle building a user interface and creating something usable.  Where has Mt Gox failed, and how can we do it better?
