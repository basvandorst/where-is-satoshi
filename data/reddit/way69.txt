It’s quite obvious here that AT&amp;T was negligent, just because the guy doesn’t subscribe to the private key mantra, doesn’t mean that AT&amp;T was any less negligent. 
I’m not sure why the community seems to always blame individuals when crypto is stolen and give tech companies a free pass. This logic doesn’t apply to any other hacking attempts, like internet banking fraud.

I give up and am no longer interested in the thread  ;-)

Bit of narcissism going on here, people like you only hear your own voices.

Don’t suppose your a Linux Admin by day? You sound friendly enough to be one. 
My issue is with the attitude the community has when someone loses money. It’s toxic. 
And yes, I think crypto security still has a long way to go before it will be commodity technology. It’s not user friendly and I reserve my right to talk tinfoil hats when I read articles on here about fiat currencies and conspiracy theories. Right now it’s a mainstream crackpot currency.

And hide your cash in your mattress and wear a tinfoil hat. 
There should be better online security measures and people should be advocating for it. Storing your keys offline also has its own risks, just like keeping jewellery and money at your home is also risky.

It wasn’t a cloned SIM card though. So it’s negligence on AT&amp;T’s side. Not sure why you’re defending them.

Or you’re just too lazy to scroll up in the comments. It’s one of the first comments on this thread dude. 
“Kerstn: Hope this guy loses”

No, this is a case of identity fraud and AT&amp;T not doing security checks. If they wiped out your bank account this way, would that also be ok?

Because everything else nowadays is cloud based, ie Azure Key Vault. Yet the bitcoin community chants analogue like it’s their only mantra. What’s more infuriating is that you are smug about it when someone loses money.  
Never mind the numerous cases of people losing their keys that are stored offline. 
Don’t be a dick.

Saying things like “I hope the guy loses the case against AT&amp;T” is toxic and that’s my issue with those whole thread and why I commented in the first place.

I never said you need to feel bad but you also don’t need to act like a 5 year old the minute someone else loses money. Just because bitcoin is decentralised, does not mean that it’s suddenly acceptable for tech companies to get away with identity fraud breaches on their side. 
It’s a self righteous wanker attitude.

It’s funny how world markets in general aren’t looking too rosey but every blogger seems to view the bitcoin price in isolation.
