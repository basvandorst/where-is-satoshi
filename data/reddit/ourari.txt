That's _not_ a confirmation. He's sorry for his role in wrecking this particular Nakamoto family's privacy. I would be too.

Meanwhile, [the press are hounding Mr. Nakamoto](  
Update: [Dorian S. Nakamoto denies being Bitcoin-inventor Satoshi Nakamoto](  
  
Edit: For those interested in the journalistic side of things:  
  
The L.A. Times deemed the chase important enough for a live blog (WTF?!):

I agree, though I'd like to play devil's advocate for a second:  
&lt;devil's advocate&gt;    
The article mentions the wife of Newsweek's Satoshi saying that he alternates between UK English and US English. The article also states that there is little known about his life between 2001 and now. Their telling leaves room for him working for a UK entity or even being in the UK for prolonged periods of time.  
  
What's more: He could have faked it. If he's as secretive as we are to believe, and he's kind of a shut-in, he could very well have been on sleep/wake cycle similar to that of someone who lives in the UK.  
&lt;/devil's advocate&gt;  
  
Of course, if he was smart enough to fake it, I don't think he'd have used his REAL NAME.

There is one. It's a human right. It's just not being enforced because the majority of people don't seem to care or aren't aware of the extent of the violations.  
  
Don't give up on it already. Fight for it if it matters to you.

Here's how I think that could have happened:  
  
Look up the Satoshi Nakamoto's. Narrow the list down to viable candidates. Check each of them out. You can't find contact information for your most promising candidate. You do discover this particular Nakamoto has a model train hobby, possibly from an interview with a family member or former colleague. Or from the tax records they mentioned. Either those people or the tax records give you a company name. Obtain e-mail address through social engineering. Search around for data associated with that e-mail address and contact your prime candidate through e-mail.

She did obtain this Satoshi Nakamoto's personal e-mail address from a company he bought model trains from. Can I assume that the company broke the law by giving his personal information to a reporter without asking this Nakamoto for permission?

I think every journo covering this story has been trying to get a hold of his family members since the story broke. I mean, the ones who weren't chasing him around L.A. are.

The press are [hounding him]( no statement so far.  
  
Update: [Dorian Nakamoto denies having anything to do with Bitcoin](

This story is also the cover story of the first edition of their revamped print edition. [Other journalists]( have commented that the story looks like a rush-job to them. They think Newsweek probably rushed it because they wanted to get it into the print edition.

Good point. I don't think he's responsible for the what has happened and will happen to this particular Nakamoto. However, he is implicated in the story because he gave an interview. Seeing how the story turned out, he decided to distance himself from it.
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:37:37
That's not a confirmation. He's just sorry about his hand in what's happening to the Nakamoto-family mentioned in the story.

It's funny to see how this sub eats his claims up. You should check the comments over on r/privacy; They know Durov is untrustworthy.
