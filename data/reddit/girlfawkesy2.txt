Keep the links to naughty things out of fay.
While I don't agree with the prudes being all anti-ggb, I do agree that we shouldn't bring actual NSFW things into @_date: 2013-10-25 00:55:58
Alright, I took your advice. I just sent this to the mods of Hello Dear Reddit Overlords,
After taking the advice of the kind folks over at I've decided to send you a message. 
Today I came to the unfortunate realization that all the subreddits I mod, or at least most of them have been banned. This would include the popular and the unpopular and Later, I realized that anything I post on my usual account (GirlFawkesy) was ghosted. Aka I could see it, but nobody else could. It felt a lot like being dead. Being as I am a mod, I know this is what happens when the red death befalls a post or comment due to spam filtering. 
I tried to message one of the other mods of the subreddit, the charismatic and active redditor Julian702, but found that his account no longer existed. 
Thinking that there was some sort of girlsgonebitcoin mod genocide, I  attempted to reach as he's pretty awesome and a supporter of BTC in general. This has been unsuccessful so far, but I know he's a pretty busy guy. 
Figuring my subreddit was deleted perhaps because it was naughty, I noticed that was alive and well, as was So then I thought it was due to the combination of bitcoin and nudity, but is alive and well. 
Then I thought it was due to bitcoin and breasts being combined, but also seems to be happy as ever. 
So then I really didn't know. I like reddit a lot. I've enjoyed gold. I've enjoyed I've enjoyed a great deal. I really am pretty sad about my account being branded as canned ham. I'm really sad though about being banned without a peep or explanation. 
So gods of Reddit. Hear my prayer. 
Why has Reddit forsaken me today?

no, I'm talking to the mods now. This is basically my fault due to the mods using the subreddit as a traffic souce for projects that we benefited from financially. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:09:30
has been banned for awhile due to copyright infringement. Thats why it became @_date: 2013-10-25 00:09:57
its videos4btc.info
@_date: 2013-10-25 11:46:07
sigh. This is why ggb needed to exist. So this wasn't happening in the actual bitcoin subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 21:35:22
You mean like reddit? 
maybe we'll start posting on spacedicks. That seems to be tolerated. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:31:59
Already have. Send me a pm from a new account and ill update you. I cant message you as your account is shadowbanned.
@_date: 2013-10-25 11:40:11
Not yet, still waiting to hear back from the mods. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 11:41:46
I don't know. I hope so. There isn't a policy about it. More just an ethical reddiquette sort of thing that I violated. 
How can anyone learn to mod if you're never allowed to improve from your mistakes? It certainly wasn't malicious. I hope they give me a chance to do better. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 00:22:23
I don't want to deluge them with messages. I'll wait and see if huey replies by tomorrow, then maybe I'll branch out. 
I'm still hoping this was the act of some overzealous mod and not a high level reddit decision. 
Especially because poor and are still up, and that would def make this feel very personal.

Okay, you don't have to like it, but reddit is full of adult/nsfw things. You don't even have to like me. One thing we can all agree on though is that Bitcoin gives people anonymous freedom with money in a way that has never before been seen. was something I looked forward to every day after working all damn day in my lab. It was a fun place anyone could visit for free, comment, or express themselves as they saw fit. Sometimes that expression involved boobs. All the better. 
Its not just that the subreddits were banned. My entire account has been removed. If you look at you see nothing. I can comment/post but it doesn't show. This is also true of some of the other female posters, but beyond that, also true of whom many of you know as an active community member. I'm just now seeing the extent of this sweeping moderation. If anyone notices anything else please comment. 
I have messaged as he's generally pretty supportive of bitcoin endeavors but I haven't heard anything back yet. No idea what caused this, who did it, or why. No explanation whatsoever. 
**Edit: I'm forced to edit this post for all replies as it seems anything I post from my IP address is auto-marked as spam which is awesome. I don't understand why this wouldn't apply to or or by applying the same logic. Even more insane is that is totally unscathed which is quite literally the exact same thing under another name.**
**Second Edit: Perhaps I should start posting over at which is still going strong. Do strap-ons count?**
**Last Edit for the night: I heard back from the mods:**
**bitcrunch [A] via sent 43 minutes ago
Your subreddits were banned and your account was banned for creating an agreement where you got a kickback for using your subreddit to drive traffic to a business or domain. Mods are supposed to be neutral monitors, and shouldn't EVER make deals with outside companies to use their mod position to their own benefit.**
The sidebar contained links to a number of sites owned by mods or people involved in the site including cam4btc, strip4bit, videos4btc, my blog, and so on. Visitation to these sites benefited the parties involved (such as myself) fiscally. I'm still not sure why the ban was so wide though. 
I've asked for more information and apologized for being a shitty mod. Hopefully they will let us start out again with a clean slate. I'll update when I hear back. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 11:39:49
I don't think that was the issue. It was the relationship with the subreddit and direct mod promotion of external sites. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:39:41
my account is still shadowbanned so its basically worthless
