Indeed but current mainstream access to it is through exchanges. You can say whatever you want just wait till you get that IRS letter. If you’re an exchange you can play by those rules or you leave for somewhere else.

As many times as they can just to piss you off. And once you’re pissed off real good, they’ll do it again just for good measure.

For the person who does not understand that just because something is a great idea doesn’t mean it will become great itself.

What kind of mining is going on here? Mining those those credit cards on unsuspecting leechers using your free WiFi?

Well I don’t know what bank you use but that statement is a little anecdotal. Your bank may be closing but other banks have increased their branches for 2018 like Chase, Citi etc. 
I think smaller less commercialized banks that don’t have  easy to use online interfaces to conduct banking, across multiple platforms, like the larger banks can offer they will be left behind. I think this will happen whether crypto exists or not. Why? Because it was happening before it existed. In the mid-2000s Chase was voted number 1 online banking system in which you could transfer like 2,000 dollars domestically free to anyone in a time where most regional and local banks didn’t even have ‘online accounts’. 
Now Is crypto causing it to happen faster? Most likely yes. However don’t under estimate the online banking, ease of use and convenience current larger banks can offer over small ones. That’s a big selling point for mainstream users who have only used banks their whole lives.
