Number of exchanges isn't the issue, it is whether they are reputable and trustworthy. Also a higher market cap would make it less likely that a group of trades could have such an impact on the market in general (exception for high holding individuals, but a high market cap would minimize the damage)
This can only be done by widespread adoption and as much as I want to resist it; regulation.
multiple exchange competitiveness is a good thing for all. I would be nervous if there was only one exchange, as it would lead to regulation and higher prices for trades: essentially a monopoly.

Wells Fargo calls Bitcoin summit on ‘rules of engagement’ 
 
**Right. So as people have to use banks primarily as a way of exchanging Fiat for BTC, the banks feel they have all the power.** 
 
Wells Fargo has convened a group of finance executives, virtual currency experts and representatives from the US government to discuss “rules of engagement” with Bitcoin, amid concern about the money laundering risks of the new currency. 
 
**Much like Quantum Physics, Anyone that calls themselves a "Virtual currency expert" either doesn't know what they are talking about, or is an idiot (creators exempt) Concern about money laundering is understandable, especially since the big banks of the world such as HSBC have been so good at it.** [here]( 
 
**Realistically, the fact that their primary concern is money laundering is a joke.** 
 
The bank, the largest in the US by market value, has emerged as one of the major financial institutions most interested in dealing with a potential new Bitcoin economy. But regulatory uncertainty has deterred banks from offering services to virtual currency start-ups. 
 
**Translation: They are more than happy to take a customers money, but they want to cover their asses. Banks would prefer that there is no regulatory standards as it is the quickest way to higher profits, and if they make a mistake they can always point to the oversight and regulations and the "too big to fail" ethos to guarantee stupendous bailouts.** 
 
Wells’ anti-money laundering chief, Jim Richards, has launched a group to examine how it might safely offer Bitcoin-related services or banking arrangements to virtual currency entrepreneurs, according to people familiar with the initiative. 
 
**Ass covering with the illusion of being interested in new ventures and ideas.** 
 
Last year, US authorities seized a Wells Fargo bank account belonging to Mark Karpeles, founder of Bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox, and charged him with failing to declare that the account would be used to run a money transmitting business. 
 
**Because if you don't pay your protection money to the worlds largest cartel, they get a bit pissy** 
 
Earlier in 2013, the US Treasury declared that Bitcoin businesses must register as money services businesses and impose anti-money laundering checks on customers, just like traditional banks. Most of the 50 US states also impose their own regulations on money services businesses. 
 
**While regulation would streamline bitcoin into the mainstream, it would essentially be transplanting an already ageing, failing and "too many middlemen" system onto bitcoin. I doubt they can coexist but hey..** 
 
Banks worried that they would be held responsible for any money laundering breaches at Bitcoin companies that failed to meet these stringent standards and before each of the states had clarified their own approaches to Bitcoin. 
 
**Like they are worried when they have laundered money before, paid a fine of a few million to a billion or so without admitting guilt and moved on.** 
 
The difficulty in persuading financial institutions to offer bank accounts has become one of the biggest difficulties facing Bitcoin entrepreneurs in the US. 
 
**Yes it is. Many bitcoin entrepreneurs in the US see profit only. Entrepreneurial spirit usually has profit only as a tally, while attempting to make some great and amazing is the priority. This isn't a slander to all of them. They miss the bigger picture of bitcoin.** 
 
Wells’ public-private group, comprising more than a dozen members, was scheduled to meet in San Francisco on Tuesday to debate the security issues surrounding banking and Bitcoin. 
 
One possible aim would be to produce a set of anti-money laundering principles for established financial institutions to follow when dealing with virtual currency start-ups, according to a person familiar with the event. 
 
Wells chief executive John Stumpf said it was the bank’s practice to examine financial innovations. 
 
“We have made enormous investments as a company and as an industry in a payments system that is secure, and we need to be sure we are up to speed with what other things are going on and their risks and rewards,” he said. 
 
“We want to make sure we understand what it is, what it does and what it does not . . . .. The world is changing and will continue to change. Whether Bitcoin will be a big part of that, who knows?” 
 
**More like: Whether banking institutions are as they are now will be a big part of that, who knows?** 
 
Last month the Congressional Research Service circulated a report on virtual currencies for policy makers, setting out a list of areas where the legal and regulatory approach to Bitcoin remains unclear. These range from national tax issues, because Bitcoin profits are not recorded within the traditional financial system, to concerns among individual states. 
 
“Bitcoin raises a number of legal and regulatory concerns including its potential for facilitating money laundering, its treatment under federal securities law, and its status in the regulation of foreign exchange trading,” the report said. 
 
And it added: “State authorities moving in the direction of regulating virtual currencies are sometimes discovering problems in applying existing laws to the technological currencies.” 
 
**Square peg, round hole. What is needed is a bridge. I would make a bet that this conference solves nothing, however it is an important step.**

I look at this and see the same continuous perhaps even erroneous arguments. While it is true that there are some in the community who only see profit as a motive, or worse profit by deception, the vast majority of People using bitcoin can fall into some simple categories:  
 
Those that are in it for investment. There are many that have seen the rise of bitcoins price as adoption and speculation increase as a way to invest without the banks or other services getting in the middle. There are also many people who mistakenly think that bitcoin is a way to make quick easy money. 
 
Those that wish to use it as an unrestricted sales tool or to purchase things. The convenience of not having to give an arm and a leg to merchants such as Visa in order to just do business, or the ability to buy things simply without any fuss is one of the most appealing widely spread and widely adopted tools that bitcoin has at its disposal. It has many other yet to be implemented features such as Notary functions, document verification, Trusts and escrows etc but the main function is to purchase things!. It also helps massively when wishing to purchase goods from places that have restricted trading as some countries only ship within their own borders. 
 
 
Those that are anti big government or along similar lines. Many people have fear of government. That is certainly justified given the revelations since 2003 although to be frank, anyone that didn't have some kind of clue that things have been heading this way must have their head in the sand. Many people see bitcoin as a way to take back control of their finances. 
 
Those that are in it for the purposes of deception or illicit activities. Silk road and the hundreds of other services like it for better or for worse, provided a method for people to avoid local laws and even break the law. People still continue to use services like this today and just as a hitman can be hired from between 10-30 thousand USD, bitcoin can act the same way. This is a stain on the positive aspects of bitcoin. 
 
Now remembering that the vast majority of people using bitcoin are in one way or another simply fed up with the bullshit that goes on with the world banking systems, the limits of trade controlled by countries for the sake of higher profits (and protecting local jobs, usually with the profit motive acting as the predominant motive), and finally they want more control and portability of their 'money'. 
 
The potential regulators, speculators and commentators worldwide often point to a few bad apples and label bitcoin and other crypto currencies as "Money laundering, terrorist funding, ponzi schemes etc". They also point to the volatility, and the hacks on exchanges and online wallets as their proof that bitcoin is bad and that bitcoin must be regulated or "banned" 
 
While the term "banning" is incredibly laughable (as the war on drugs worldwide can attest) the most laughable concern is that bitcoin could be used for money laundering. Many of the biggest (including those that fit the "too big to fail" category) banks and financial institutions have been fined record amounts for money laundering, bribing of government officials, processing of money for economically sanctioned governments such as Iran and even processing money for drug cartels and dictators.  
 
These same banks through the power of the US treasury &amp; Federal reserve took over 700 Billion dollars from American taxpayers (and other international banks have taken similar bailouts) without having to admit ANY GUILT in order to "save us from financial Armageddon".... the very same Armageddon that they created in the first place with CDS,CDO's and the rest of the unregulated derivatives market. 
 
The idea that Leaders of countries around the world, who have heads of major banks as their chairs of their respective treasuries could look at bitcoin and shout and cry "Money laundering!" is absurd as well as "pot calling the kettle black" irony. The only difference is that people who have laundered money Using the bitcoin protocol are getting arrested and thrown in Gaol (whereas the criminals of wall street are paying fines without accepting liability and in some cases, walking off scot free!!) 
 
I am against legislation that forces people to treat bitcoin as a Fiat asset, but this is obviously the path that governments are going to take, if not for some aspect of control but certainly for any ability to make damn sure they get their cut of CGT and general Taxes. That is another discussion that many of you here have already begun. 
 
Finally just a quick note on online wallets. When people blindly believe that bitcoin is untraceable, anonymous and unhackable by allowing some online website to house their bitcoin i believe that they deserve to have their wallets compromised. Billions of dollars goes into Internet security worldwide and the only sure way to secure yourself from hacking is Cold paper storage. It does destroy portability so many of us use software such as bitcoinQT on our computers either jacked in or not. The trade off you make for portability for security is one that you have to make, but if you hand your Bitcoin to a website, you always run the risk that the website could be compromised; whether by an external threat or an internal one. 
 
In closing, i do not doubt that bitcoin can/does have a dark side, but the possibilities for good massively outweigh the negatives and no other currency can stack up to bitcoin. There any many people that stand to gain from bitcoin succeeding, and there any many people that would gain if it fell. The time of restrictive trade, rippoff merchants, government "back pocketing" and ignorance of the collective want of the people is ending. Get on the train or get the hell out of its way!! 
 
edit: i know probably TL:DR for most. Apologies.

I've used this service in the past, and they did pay out. On average it took 3 sessions, which was roughly 30 minutes of clicking through ads until the "come back tomorrow" sign comes up. So roughly three days. That was when the cashout was 60 uBTC, but since then they have upped it to 100uBTC, which will take a few more sessions.
You could do it for a year and maybe make the equivalent of $1USD (presumption of electricity being free) but what i felt the point of it was to have some kind of balance in your wallet.

I was stating a process, not a specific function. The process was based on how movements/social conscious evolves/ can evolve.
One person or a group have an idea, they deploy methods in order to attract attention. Petitions are a method used. If enough traction is gained, it can become a movement, which then can progress etc. It's not my fault that you ignored the big picture, saw the word "petitions" and decided to make a comment (while true) unrelated to the point.

update: just saw a bit on Squawk OTS discussing mtgox. It's nice to see them report how mtgox is blaming the protocol but the consensus by the community is that mtgox is at fault. Also speculation that there is interest being put forward for a large US based exchange to open soon. rumors and speculation aside, this just adds more good news to the bitcoin front.

In her defense, the question states: "created for use in online transactions" i.e. only purpose is for online transactions with the consensus of online being for standard online shopping etc. One could make the argument that while PayPal is not a direct currency, it could be classed as a online transaction currency. Remember Paypal acts as a tool for online transactions without having to expose your credit card, whereas Bitcoin is a direct transfer of Wealth from one user to another.
 
The question better worded "Which of these is a name of a digital currency that is not based on a Fiat system". The contestant could still be tricked as i have found the average Joe does not know what Fiat means, and the question could have more relevance.

Sadly bitcoin is likely (Once gov intervention occurs) to run into difficulties. Blockchain tech will be utilized by governments for a completely cashless society based on either an international or national "coin" with a digital record of every purchase made.
It does really make you question the origin of bitcoin and blockchain tech which isnt helped by a mysterious alias being linked to a single highly complicated white paper. Perhaps the government has been involved from the start. In the 60's people were cautious and made half hearted jokes about being wiretapped, spied on etc. Fast forward fifty years plus later, we're surrounded by "wiretaps" cameras and all manner of recording equipment. It takes time for the citizenry to become used to handcuffs.
Bitcoin and other crypto will continue but will be relegated to a more black and shades of grey market  once a national or international government issued digital wallet exists.

Equality of opportunity is key of course and as an earlyish adopter I agree with what you've said, just concerned an equality of outcome argument could be the reason why btc is ignored by the populace in favour of a bank or government block chain running a (Mr robot styled) ecoin which is the worst outcome.

Not just that's it's almost a fairy tale where the princess (or prince) lives happily ever after but that you truly are a person who has found a sense of peace in your life where you aren't headlong rushing to an early grave to pay the bills.
The lack of any info on the 'chain as others have referenced leaves me to be sceptical and wonder if this could be a sort of PsyOp to lower the price (potential dump incoming etc), publicity stunt or an attempt to show people a different side of Btc and recognising that it is different to Fiat and should not be treated like Fiat or precious metals as a store of wealth, thereby showing the most important features of BTC;  decentralisation and proof of work. 
Either way it doesn't really matter. Whatever you choose to do if this is confirmed, hopefully you fully understand your individual cap and know that you could do some damage.

As a person who has invested in the stock market, i find it incredibly difficult to look at bitcoin charts arc without being reminded of exact positions before crashes that happen almost like clockwork in the stock market. The only thing that puts some doubt in my mind of a supermassive crash is that bitcoin is deflationary whereas most if not all other markets are inflationary, and that the price of bitcoin is reliant on demand, inflation levels of Fiat currency, increasingly difficult to mine and finite capacity.
It almost has to crash though, it cannot continue to climb so steeply. It is my best guess that bitcoin will have its most successful spike the minute that QE3 is closed, to sit at a stable level of around $4200-4500 USD with a much more gradual rate of increase, with spiking occuring at each difficulty level of mining.
This is of course only if things continue as they are and there are no major government intrusions.

I agree with you about the need for simplicity, but i also think that the population should advance and not sit stagnant in "old ways". The younger generations are more accepting and understanding in the rapid change that this world is going through and quite simply the slow to adapt will (and perhaps should) be left behind. It is the older generations who (while perhaps not having the benefits of being raised in a techsociety) are keeping the status quo's set longer than they have to be.
