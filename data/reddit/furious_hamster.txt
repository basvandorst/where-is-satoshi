Dude, I’m just gonna stop this discussion and tell you that you don’t know anything about the financial markets or how they work. This is NOT the first time this has happened in the history of the market. Quit bullshitting. You can support whoever you like, I’m pretty nonpartisan as far as things go, but just stop talking out your ass.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:41:13
I don't think you've thought this out at all. Seems overly optimistic, I find it hard to believe you're getting &gt;300% returns year after year.
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:16:22
I am acting like an adult, which usually requires having a bit of realism and skepticism. Sorry for saying the bit about "not having thought this out at all," that was premature, although I can see that it was merited now. Don't be so butt-hurt.
I don't know much about the economics of bitcoin mining, but from a common sense perspective (and a finance background), I don't see how these returns could possibly be consistent. From what I can tell, it's not particularly hard to obtain the equipment. Profits are entirely limited by scale, hardware, and access to cheap electricity. I don't get how this won't be competed away. I don't think you know, either. But then again, stupider people than you have gotten lucky before.
I will say that your word salad and overall arrogance aren't good omens. I am deeply amused at the irony of your telling me to Google the Dunning-Kruger effect, Mr. DavidAELevy. Good luck with your little scheme, old chap. Hopefully it works out for ya.

Oh, sorry, I thought you were referring to the tax cuts, not to the positive months. Got deeply perturbed by that because we obviously saw some big cuts under Reagan and Bush, also solidified some cuts with Obama.
That’s not attributable to trump either though, for what it’s worth. There’s been a lot of stuff going on dampening volatility in markets recently, esp with rise of passive investing, more quant strategies, and central bank stimulus. I think saying that it’s all due to Trump is horribly misleading.
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:56:01
That's fair, I don't think anybody can dispute that tax cuts have helped/will help stock market returns. I just absolutely hate it when people try to make Trump to be some miracle worker, and a common misconception is that presidents play a significant role in determining stock returns.
Agree that people should stay objective and neutral. By the same token, people should recognize good policy even if they dislike the politician.

Trump’s impact on the stock market is somewhere ranging from “not attributable” to “minimal.” You’re free to support the man, but the stock market is not driven by the president like that.

You could mine altcoins, although you’d want to swap out the GPU because that’s pretty unusable even for those. For bitcoin, GPUs are even more useless, as mining there has moved to more specialized hardware.

It seems the BTC gods appreciated your sacrifice!
@_date: 2019-01-05 10:49:57
Its not Buffett vs math, it’s Buffett vs an asset that throws off no cash, is illiquid, and hard to transact with.
If I’d put money in BRK, I would’ve made 319% over 10 years. I’m okay with that, and that’s very far from “losing money”. Learn your facts, you embarrass yourself when you spout stuff like that. If you’re super confident, we can make a bet on which will be around 10 years from now, BTC or Berkshire Hathaway.
Edit: also, learn to spell, man — I can’t take you seriously
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:09:22
I hold BTC and am a huge proponent of it, but such a lack of understanding of our financial system is laughable and destroys credibility

\&gt;says Friedman is wrong
\&gt;fails to understand the relationship between credit and inflation
\&gt;proceeds to cite inelastic products to provide evidence that consumers don’t move along the demand curve
Dude, high credit is because consumers want to pull surplus into the present, and also inflation makes debt worth less (when it’s fixed rate). Inflation doesn’t mean shit gets cheaper tomorrow, it means your cash has less value. Everything you typed is just laughably wrong. Go back to school, man.

@_date: 2019-01-04 23:16:25
Yeah, government says, “we recognize this.” Value is set by market.
@_date: 2018-11-25 15:05:27
Like I said, not a clue, but it’s not the banks — you realize they have to file these pesky things called financial statements, right? And if you look at their balance sheet, you can see what they’re holding. And not a single one of them has even the slightest hint of bitcoin on them.
And also, what? Banks are insolvent? LOL where in the world did you get that idea from??
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:59:33


Shit logic off the bat.


That’s not even close to what I said in my original comment. I’m saying that BRK is much more durable and I’d bet any day that bitcoin goes to 0 before BRK does. I’m not here to speculate on price increases, I have no idea what prices will do. So that’s my bet, BTC goes to 0 before BRK does, if you want to take it.


The day that “throwing off cash” is pointless is the day I known that the “investor base” of BTC is clueless and has no financial background.
I guarantee I’m better informed than you... I’ve given presentations to institutional investors and up to date on adoption/trends. I might not be as technically informed, but that’s really not necessary to understand where BTC might get value from.


LMAO what does this even mean? Is this you trying to flex or something? If so, I’m cringing really hard for you, man. What are you, a teenager?
@_date: 2019-01-12 11:57:01
A “subscription” model as you describe it is possible even today, the margins just have to be high enough — this is not a new concept and bitcoin will not change the dynamic. Also won’t happen as long as companies can make sufficient improvements to the products to outpace the increase in value of currency; if iPhone gets 100% better by whatever measure you like but currency only goes up by 50% and prices moves up 25%, consumers will still consider it a bargain and be willing to pay.
@_date: 2019-01-05 02:50:45
I understand — I guess I just don’t think it’s a meaningful distinction at this point. I do appreciate the willingness to discuss
@_date: 2019-01-05 04:13:33
Why is this in here
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:58:46
I don't think you quite understand how prices are set and markets work. If the government said "the dollar is worth 200 Euro" without doing anything, literally nobody will listen to them.
@_date: 2019-01-06 00:13:06
Is it really trolling if you’re actually stupid? He’s delivered 21% for 50+ years, I think he can have a few years where he’s underperformed a massive bull market, especially given the absurd amounts of cash he has. If that’s the definition of “fraud” or “abysmal,” sign me the fuck up. Idiot.
Everything goes to 0 in the long run. But I bet BTC goes to 0 before Berk does.
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:45:15
It’s like you’ve never heard of the Bank of England or Zimbabwe lmao
Actually, again, seems like you just don’t have any idea how currency value is actually measured

This has got to be the stupidest thing I’ve seen on this site, and thats pretty tough 
@_date: 2018-03-10 07:57:10
I don’t know how to break it to you man, but BTC will not deliver you from these things. I am in this, I think it’s wonderful technology and it will make many systems better and cheaper. But it will not guarantee you salvation. Learning where to put your money is a much better proposition than hoping for a revolution. Be smart. Manage your finances. Don’t spend more than you have unless it’s to generate value. Control your risks, and that includes not pinning the majority of your net worth on one asset class. And please type more legibly.
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:14:03

@_date: 2019-01-05 02:23:28
Whether a currency has value or how it performs vs other currencies is one and the same. You cant have $5 that is capable of buying a Big Mac, that is worth €10, but €3 buys a Big Mac also. In the same vein, you can’t have a bitcoin that can buy a Lamborghini but only fetches $200 in the market. The values are set by the assets that people are willing to exchange for them. Therefore, the value of $5 USD isnt a Big Mac because the government says it is, but rather because that’s what people have universally agreed to pay for it. It doesn’t matter if the government says “$5 is now worth a Big Mac and fries,” if you try to swap that for a euro equivalent you won’t get as much euros as would buy you a Big Mac meal in France. So your designation that bitcoin is better because it “earned” its way up is entirely arbitrary — at the end of the day, it’s still a common market that decides prices.

I get it, it's just a pointless post. It's not corruption or anything stupid like that, it's just how PayPal works. Maybe slow, maybe bothersome, but the rest of us accept those tradeoffs for security. BTC doesn't have issues like that, but it does have issues where I could forget my private key or lose a hard drive and easily lose thousands of dollars. I don't point those out as signs of "corruption," because it's just flaws in the system but it's not malice.
@_date: 2018-12-02 21:33:40
I mean, that’s kinda part of using PayPal — if they think there’s suspicious activity, they stop it. I don’t know why that’s something to make a post about when it’s been a feature forever. It’s not like they’re being actively hostile towards him.
@_date: 2018-12-03 20:31:29
That’s the stupidest shit I’ve ever heard. You think bitcoin is unequivocally better than gold or fiat in all circumstances? If so, you’ve got another think coming. I’ll tell you what I told the other guy, if you want to make a bet on that, I’ll take the other side all day.

@_date: 2018-12-03 18:32:59
Haha dude, I’m all for bitcoin but some of you are just so far removed from reality. I’ll take the other side of that trade any day, if you’re actually interested in setting up a wager with defined timeline and payout.

Haha dude, I see you’re a little bitch and that’s okay. If you really want to, there are a dozen ways we can make this impartial — we can even have a smart contract on ETH if you want! But as is, you’re clueless as hell and so you’ve resorted to trying to save face and make it look like my credibility is the only thing that precludes you from putting money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2018-12-02 16:48:35
I bet if somebody were stealing from you, the need for additional verification/security would start sounding awfully great, wouldn’t it?
If they didn’t have this and you got your shit stolen because you’re pants-on-head stupid, you’d probably make another post about how PayPal doesn’t do enough to protect you.
Also, try and use more exclamation points in your post, I felt I didn’t quite get the full outrage you’re experiencing at THE SYSTEM right now!!!
@_date: 2018-12-29 07:38:57
If the government decided to be malicious towards me, I don’t think bitcoin will stop anything at all.

Are you serious? If BTC completely replaced gold, then it has an easy 110x from here.
