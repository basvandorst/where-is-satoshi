They take like 5-10 transactions an hour and you need put in your tx id quite literally the second it hits the top of the hour. I was lucky and got it my first try and my 2 week unconfirmed tx was confirmed within 2 hours.
If you miss one time, just try again the next hour. Keep your finger hovering once you get close to the top of the hour lol. Good luck.

Dude. Whatever you're willing to lose. If it's .02, so be it. Even .002 is respectable. The fact you're buying is respectable.

He's new and learning the ropes which is why I suggested coinbase. But yeah, gdax is the next level up.

Could go up. Could go down. Maybe moon? Take out your magic 8 ball and check. Otherwise, only put in what you're willing to lose.

I've never sold so I'm not sure. There's a fee to move it to your own wallet, though. But that's normal for everywhere as far as I'm aware.

Think of how cheap 5k sounds now... And that was only a few short weeks ago. And soon 8k will sound like a steal. Just dive in and go from there.

I synched and it found my missing BTC. Haha I was stressing.
Thanks so much!

Lol! I love this guy. The expression says it all.

1. Don't buy with money you don't have.
2. Only put in what you can afford to lose.

Look into how to buy off of GDAX on YouTube. Then transfer to a wallet. There are apps for Android/iPhone. Or you can get hardware wallet but those are expensive.
Tons of info on here and lots of good tutorials on YouTube.

What do you mean BTC just as popular as an iPhone? I'd say it's the opposite. I know plenty of people who have never even heard of Bitcoin let alone even the basics of it.

I love it when you talk dirty. ��

Unless you paid via debit/credit card? That's instant but a bank transfer takes about 7 days.

Legit life savings? 
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:49:09
Are you going straight BTC or diversifying in some alts too? Just curious.

7 full work days for me. Sucks. ��
