Yeah, stability, because one day, IRD will issue exchange rates for BTC, and they are what you get paid in.  Remember the Ken example who got paid 7BTC per year?  Lets assume IRD fixed their rate on 1st August for the month at 14767.06, and Ken gets 7 BTC/ yr, paid fortnightly.
So on 1st Aug Ken get paid.  Top line is  0.5 BTC.  Converted it is 7383.53 NZD, tax/ACC is 2176.06, so takehome is 0.35264126 BTC worth $5207.47
On August 15 Ken gets paid again, takehome is 0.35264126, the same, because of the IRD monthly forward looking rate.  And I just realised I fucked up because we haven't got to the 15th yet!!   But the last rate was 17,605.73, so Ken's takehome is worth, in NZD, 6,208.50.  Ken lucked in. If BTC had dropped below the IRD number, Ken would have lost out.


Only if you convert to a fiat currency.  If you spend BTC there is no CGT payable.  Bring back the 10 BTC pizza!

Not "flat" - stable.  As in not volatile.  Stable enough that IRD can say what the value of BTC will be for the following fortnight, and that will be accurate enough for people to get paid using that as an exchange rate.

If BTC (or indeed, any relevant crypto-currency) had value stability with regard to the normal fiat currencies, then capital gains wouldn't be an issue.
Also the IRD have restrictions around which crypto-currencies one can use as NZD equivalents, it cant be any crypto-currency.  Not by name, but by characteristics.

Ken gets $10K salary a month tax paid.  So about $120K a year, he'll get ([calculator]( $7,317 take-home after tax.  He's elected 50% bitcoin, so he'll get $3658.50 NZD, and, assuming he gets paid today, (1 BTC = 17,665.98 NZD) 0.207092955 BTC, if my sums are right.
The PAYE was entirely calculated on the NZD value of his salary.
It can work the other way; if your salary was 7 BTC per year, you'd get 0.583333333 BTC/Month, and that would be converted each month to figure out what it was worth in NZD ($10,305.16), annualised up to a year (123661.86), PAYE and ACC levy calculated, worked to the month, 2787.27, converted to BTC, 0.157776463, and that would be subtracted from your salary BTC giving you a takehome BTC of 0.425556871.  Your employer would then have to pay the PAYE and ACC levy in NZD.
I think :)
So the bitcoin received is all tax paid.  If you invest it and it gains interest then income tax will be due on the investment income.  If it gains in value just by BTC being volatile then there is no tax payable because we don't have any capital gains tax.

Absolutely, but even if there were a CGT in place you would only need to report transactions where a capital gain was made.  If you were paid in BTC and bought toothpaste in BTC there is no question of there being a CGT liability.  But if you are paid in BTC and then sometime later convert BTC to NZD and that is more NZD than the BTC were worth when you were paid, then you have a capital gain, and thus CGT would then be payable.

Having read through the turgid text, it seems they've taken a pragmatic and sensible view.

It comes down to credibility and usability.  The more a crtypto-currency behaves like a "normal" currency, the more governments will look upon the crypto-currency as something of a "normal" currency.  
As to usability: The IRD publish exchange rates for "normal" currencies fortnightly, as their stability is such that they are relaxed at that frequency.  It would be hard to have a fortnightly reasonable *forward looking* BTC exchange rate when BTCs value wags around 20% in that timeframe.  Particularly if you were going to get paid in BTC according to that forward looking rate.  The rate might be about right, you might gain massively or lose massively.
Or to calculate your tax on the midpoint of the year rate.  One rate for the year.  Your tax bill might be tiny or huge.

Due respect aside, even if we wanted to, we couldn't "move to bitcoin".
BTC is limited to about seven transactions a second.  Tiny country New Zealand often does over a hundred transactions a second.  BTC couldn't service little 'ole New Zealand, let alone the world.
We're going to need something that is several orders of magnitude faster than BTC if we want a cryptocurrency that ordinary people can use in a transnational manner like they do today.

Its now confusing.
Read this: [Questions &amp; answers: Cryptocurrency and tax]( which says that mostly you need to record crypto transactions and account for the difference in value.  This is because cryto-currency is treated as an asset.  But then the new guidance says that:


 If they are PAYE income payments they are not assets.  Confusing.

I have argued that if there was to be a capital gains tax on speculative assets (which we don't have) then the taxman should be a party to the speculation, and enjoy his winnings, and pay up for his losses.

This is interesting.
If you buy BTC then yes, you have acquired an asset, so yes, if there are asset tax rules, you need to record stuff.
But, and I quote:


Not subject to asset rules.  I wonder if something has been missed here.
