But why would I buy Bitcoin for $1000 when I can buy Litecoin for $29. It's a cryptocurrency, also gaining traction in the small business marketplace, and hey, I can get a whole hell of a lot more Litecoins for my money. Who knows, maybe with some media attention, frenzied investors, and more speculation, I can become an early adopter and cash out with millions!
I have to believe that with a few dozen reputable cryptocurrencies in the marketplace, BTC is only soaring this high because it's the most well known. Once (read: IF) the other cryptos gain traction, BTC and the others have a high probability of stabilizing at a much lower price.

I read up on BTC in it's infancy. They were trading at less than a quarter when I really started getting interested. As a poor college student who would rather buy a case of beer, I selfishly drank myself into a stupor before buying into this cryptocurrency. I don't even think they had a technical name for it at the time. Needless to say, I'm kicking myself in the ass.

He's only summoned once a millennium, but his arrival and departure is spectacular nonetheless.

Sorry, the term *cryptocurrency* is what I was referencing with that statement.

"what brought you to Bitcoins
Heard about it on Slashdot years ago and didn't buy."
Ugh same here, wish I would have bought in at that time. Who knew it would grow to this extent.

The USD is backed my the Federal Reserve. I'm not saying this is a fail proof system. In fact I think fiat currencies are messed up, too, but they at least have wide spread adoption. Not to mention the USD is, in many ways, considered a global currency in itself.
The fact that currencies can gain and lose value is what's frightening. Yes, over decades and hundreds of years, they will undoubtedly fluctuate. But what's happening with BTC is absolutely foreign. The last time a currency fluctuated like this is popped, aka hyperinflation ([more info here](
Every investment has some form of risk. That's why you're told to spread them out with low-risk, moderate-risk, and high-risk investments. But BTC shouldn't be considered an *investment*. You should be simply exchanging your USD for a fair market value of BTC and if BTC was stable, you should be able to exchange that BTC back to USD months from now with little or no change in value. 


That's where speculation exists.

In the late 1700's, early 1800's, the United States adopted, at least for the most part, the USD. They *converted* their local/state-wide currencies into pennies, nickels, dimes, quarters, dollars, ETC. The difference here is that I exchanged, say, a steel coin that my state said was worth a dime, for a tangible coin made of 90% silver, which we all know is a precious metal. If I had a bunch of those coins I could trade it for a 91.7% $5 gold coin.  
I converted my current assets into real, tangible coins that were precious metals, so "Hey! Even if these coins don't work out, I still have the silver and gold and THAT's worth SOMETHING!". People didn't flood their banks to *buy* these coins thinking, OMG I'm going to be RICH!! They converted their assets to gold and silver coins, which from 1800 to 1964 (the year dimes, quarters, half dollars, and dollars were no longer made with gold and silver) the price of gold rose from $19.39 to $35.35 or 82%. I'll be generous and say from November of 2010 to current, BTC has increased from $0.50 to $1073 or 214,500%. 
Aside from the obvious volatility issues... BTC is digital. Unless there is a plan to turn it into paper/coin, you will never feel, see, or smell (yes *smell*) a BTC outside of a digital medium. The idea is sound, but unless major government agencies outside of China begin to adopt it, it's going to struggle to gain traction.

Great response. I'm similar in that I'm actively involved in economics/global market and find fiat currencies absolutely fascinating.

This is a fantastic use of technology. Thanks for ensuring it works!

That's a strong point I've been trying to push in this thread. Thanks for agreeing.

People are buying BTC based on speculation rather than real world application. There are a ton of pros and cons as to why you should own BTC, but on a personal level, it would be to make money on my investment (I don't own BTC &lt;sighs&gt;). 
Therein lies the problem. People are purchasing BTC as an investment rather than a form of currency. At some point, the real world application of BTC *should* come to fruition and it will be widely accepted as a form of payment. But here again we find ourselves with another problem. 
Say you're a farmer and you sell crops after the yearly harvest. You accept BTC as a form of payment. In September you are selling bushels of tomatoes (or whatever) for $10 USD or 1/100 of a BTC. You have half the people pay in USD and the other half pay in BTC. You generate $100,000 in revenue with the combination of cash and the cash equivalent in BTC. 3 months pass and the 50 BTC you now possess happen to be worth $750 instead of the $1000 per coin. You've just lost 32.5% of your gross revenue because of the price fluctuation. Now what? In future endeavors, I would be less than likely to accept BTC as a form of payment due to it's volatility. Likewise the price can increase from $1000 to $1250 and you'll be a happy camper. 
The point I'm trying to make is this: Currently, people are purchasing BTC as an investment. They want to spend $1000 now in hopes of making X amount in the future. But what they fail to realize is the actual use and application of BTC is extremely limited. It's current holders are speculators, people who are buying into it thinking the price will continue to rise. When it hits a certain point, they will cash out on their investment into their local currency in the form of cash. Very few are purchasing it as a form of currency to be used in the markets. Yes, there are local and regional businesses, online retailers, and in some countries, well respected corporations who are accepting BTC as payment. But as a whole it is quite limited. As the price continues to soar with national media attention, speculation, and frenzied investors rising, we will undoubtedly reach a point where these same questions arise. What's the practical use of BTC? How can we apply it in the market? What is it competing with? Is this currency backed by anything or anyone? When will the currency level off and stabilize? How do we enforce online security? Who will oversee BTC? 
The list goes on.
