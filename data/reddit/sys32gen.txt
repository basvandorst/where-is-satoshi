Fuck Peter Thiel.    
Shutting down a media company was incredibly shitty and unamerican. But, his shady AF company, Palantir, selling data solutions to authoritarians all over the world pisses me off more. He seems to have a beef with liberal democracy and is willing to play dirty with big data (also scary knowing he“s a Trump donor/advisor).    
    
He also has a megalomaniacal plan to [create his own waterworld](     
Spiteful, petty and smart are a dangerous combination.

I think those are great questions. And apparently controversial ones.    
Thinking about a larger time scale, ie 30-100 years, I could see the universal adaptation of bitcoin. People might have biological or wetware wallets at some point. Others may use a type fiat that is based on bitcoin.    
No guesses on how the price might stabilize. I imagine future geniuses and economists will figure out many problems like that. Not to mention the effect AI is going to have in that time frame. Actually, my biggest concern with crypto is that a superintelligent AI will break it. But, I'd love to be shown how impossible that is.

Good luck to you too.

Often what is not being said is more important than what is being said. Troubling to see a financial cable news program misinforming like this, but not surprising.

Just for fun; have any predictions? End of day, Monday. End of month?

I took out multiple Payday loans and am selling my bone marrow on the deep-web. To the MOON!

Any price predictions then? ie. One month, one year?

That sounds like a shit strategy.

Looks like your closest ATM is in Charlotte, NC. 
    
Have you considered moving? /s

I wonder if using a BTC ATM would work for you? The ones in my area (Toronto) have fees of 10% buy, 5% sell (average). I think there's a cap on how much you can sell at one time of $1000, though your local/machines may be different. [Here's]( a simple video explanation of how it works.    
Best of luck
