Everybody knows that if you have a house stuffed to the ceiling with cocaine, you're gonna need a bigger gun than can be bought at Dicks Sporting goods.  
In my example drugs are bad, but the guns are good for protection.

You realize that an "honest ponzi" scheme is still a ponzi scheme right?

I use phoenix miner with the phatk kernel and an ati card. I ran poclbm but got better hash rates with the phatk  kernel.  I used a guide to set it all up form the bitcoin forum.
[Driver and miner installation](
Worked like a charm for me.  It says it's for 11.04 but I run 10.4 and it worked just fine.

And now you know how they make their money at Dwolla.  Wires don't take 72 hours, but building interest on the collective amount of cash benefits needs some time. 
This is the biggest money earner for Western Union. Dude wires cash to family in Mexico, they don't get it for a week. Western Union made interest off of that cash. For a single transaction, it doesn't seem like much. Add all of the transactions up and the interest earnings are down right fucking huge.

This sums it all up for me honestly.


So you were in in a state of horror because you couldn't get access to your BTC and protect them from being potentially stolen.
At the same time, you are in a state of horror that you can't get access to the stolen BTC that are being dumped on the market.
And this is why BTC is turning into a joke. Some guy out there had all of his BTC ganked and people are genuinely displeased that they didn't get a shitload of them for a ridiculous price. If your wallet were ever compromised, I wonder if you would feel the same way.
This reminds me of the craigslist scams were some person posts an ad saying everything must go and folks go to the address and pilfer someones belongings, never once stopping to think that this whole situation is fucking wrong.

I'm not talking about single transactions, I'm talking about the collective amount being earned against.
Entire companies are built upon this model. Look up First Data Corp, they deal in processing transactions, verifying cc purchases, etc. Money is constantly moving in and out of accounts. Ohh and First Data Corp recently sold off Western Union. They own bill pay, and other services like that. They are not doing this for the kindness, they do it for the insane amount of money.
Where does Dwolla keep any money that you have in balance with them?

Go hop into  if you want to read some rather funny statements.  Amateur hour is rolling deep there.

I think you're missing the point. There was something going on with the website. 


Market correction that netted someone a few thousand, when they could have just slowly dumped coins and made hundreds of thousands?
What did your instincts tell you?  I'm not trying to jam you up here and call you a POS but the mentality was dominated by a couldn't care less about the other guy attitude.  I have BTC and I pulled most of it off MTgox weeks ago. 
I'm also not defending Mt.Gox. I'm trying to look for empathy for the folks who were ripped off and have yet to find it anywhere.
"In short capitalism is the economic philosophy that economic growth is best sustained by the free market forces of supply and demand. It abhors artificial interference and manipulation from governments. Unfortunately or fortunately, depending on your political persuasion, capitalism has been a very rare thing in the history of man. Governments have never been able to resist the temptation to tinker, progressives never could stomach the inevitable social discrepancies that result from a healthy capitalism, and the greedy could not resist the temptation to scam the system. Much like socialism, capitalism requires an honest clientele to function correctly."

I'm confused.
Indeed. You seem very confused.

If you lost $80 then you really didn't lose your bitcoins, you lost your bitcoin.

And that's why someone just offered a bounty to fix the bug and allow others to use qt on mac. If you respond to this with anything other than "Oh, I guess I misunderstood what the OP was asking for" then you are simply trolling for no good reason.
