It differs from merchant to merchant. Some might have a bitcoin customer per week. One merchant accepted nearly $1k in a day. You left out the word *yet*. The bitcoin economy has to start somewhere, and these are early days.

Hey great question. Payment processors that provide a POS solution will often insist that you use their POS front end. And their wallet, and their payment processing, should you wish to turn your bitcoin back into fiat. DC POS is about freedom from this walled garden model. We support Bitpay as a wallet provider and payment processor, as well as many others. We enable our merchants to easily switch between wallet/payment providers and exchange rates. Our solution is for bricks and mortar merchants. Other players in the space focus on online vendors accepting bitcoin; we are exclusively focused on providing a great product for over-the-counter businesses, with great accounting features and a platform agnostic Cashier Terminal with very, very fast transaction approvals. We are faster than swipe and pin card terminals for transaction speed. Our brand is becoming more recognised, having been mentioned in Australian press and is starting to make waves internationally. We are now servicing merchants from all over Europe, the US, the Middle East, Singapore and India. I hope you will see more of our Orange Hummingbird in the coming weeks! If you or your prospective merchants need any more info please feel free to PM me and we gladly help. Here is some recent press:

There is some devil in the detail, there. They are key differences in the service offerings of Bitpay and DC POS. DC POS allow you to choose from a number of payment processors, and a number of rate providers. Bitpay insists you use their payment processing system.  Bitpay also only allow you to remit to bank when you have $1000 in some parts of the world, and as uptake is slow, that can mean an unacceptable delay for some merchants. Both are great products, but they are different products so comparing their pricing directly won't give you the full picture. Oh - disclaimer - I work for DC POS!

My company (DCPOS.com) has developed a bitcoin POS system. Integration with fully-fledged POS systems is difficult - they all speak different protocols. We are going to see which are the most commonly used in our most common merchant sectors, and pick off the top 5. We also plan to integrate for enterprise - class merchants (ie  franchises etc). As a payment facilitator, we charge for our services. It's much cheaper than traditional forms of electronic remittance, though at aroun half-a-percent. Our product is  platform agnostic and as such isa "web application".

Thanks for the feedback, Aussiehash. We haven't gone into too much detail on our website  yet because we are still beta testing with 10 merchants for a couple of weeks. We'll include lots more info about our product and how to join DC POS very soon. Our fees haven't been finalised yet, but will most likely be 1 percent. DC POS has some pretty cool features that set us apart. Get in touch if you would like to know more.

Ok great. Let's email and we can arrange the info you need. PMed  you

We are a Melbourne, Australia based start-up who have just completed our successful pilot program with a range of local retailers. Our technology has proven to be robust, so we are very proud to bring our service to market. We have some innovative features, such as choice of wallet/payment provider, platform agnosticism, very low fees, rapid confirmations and an easy to use interface.

Can't wait to share some celebration beers and subs with Coinjar and HeroSubsAU tomorrow night at [General Assembly]( . Melbourne has more than 50 businesses accepting bitcoin - we are the bitcoin capital of Australia and we will soon be the bitcoin capital of the world. Multiple ATMs installed around the city last week and more merchants accepting bitcoin the easy way with DCPOS.com - proudly made in Melbourne! Hero subs are delicious sandwiches and great value as well. Good on you herosubs.com.au !

Hi, my company,  is based in Melbourne. Our Point of Sale system makes it easy for businesses like yours to accept bitcoin.  We have just gone live last week after three months of successful beta-testing with more than a dozen Melbourne bricks and mortar businesses. We give you a choice of online wallet providers, but as you are in Melbourne you should consider  I will PM you my phone number and deliver you a tablet tomorrow for you to try out our solution if you like. Our solution is easier to use than a cash register and faster than EFTPOS. You can elect to keep your earnings in bitcoin or have them remitted to your bank account in Australian dollars, with dollar-for-dollar intra day hedging (which means that if you sell a sandwich for $5, you get $5, and are not exposed to fluctuations in the bitcoin / AUD price).
@_date: 2014-05-14 03:05:13
We have aimed to be platform agnostic with a small technology footprint - so you can certainly run DCPOS on your tablet. DCPOS enables bricks and mortar businesses to accept Bitcoin on any device with a browser and an internet connection. 
EDIT: Spelling

It's great to see the application of quality cycle being facilitated for developers integrating with the BitPay API. Bitcoin developers have often rushed products to market without applying quality processes such as user and security testing. DC POS has aligned all business processes with ISO 9001 in order to raise the standard.
A fully featured test environment should lead to future interesting stuff too - the creative tools for new applications.
Nice to see separation of concerns for both BitPay developers and their developer-customers such as DCPOS.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:08:57
Hey thanks for replying. We want to be as global as possible; and as such offer a choice of wallets so that users can have the easiest and cheapest method for storing and converting bitcoin in their region. We are very customer focused (and for us that's merchant focused) so we are interested in what merchants want in different regions. 
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:45:42
Currently Coinjar are free if you are keeping bitcoin, or 0.5% is you remit straight to currency and take advantage of their intra-day hedging. This makes the fees around 1%, which is very competitive in the world of electronic remittance. DCPOS has put a great deal of energy and resources into producing software that is stable, secure, useable, and well supported and our pricing reflects that. DCPOS declines to recommend an Australian Bank, but we know that CBA  have been problematic for bitcoin related businesses.
@_date: 2014-05-22 02:12:04
There are several bars and cafes that accept bitcoin using our bitcoin point of sale solution,  Some that come to mind are Grumpy's Green and Habitat Lounge in Collingwood, Rollerdoor Cafe in North Melbourne, Cafe Imbiss and Eclectico Clothing in St Kilda,
Middle Park Podiatry and Laser Clinic in Middle Park, Little Lost Land on Carlisle Street, Polyester books on Brunswick St.

We have been having some issues with our production server today. We have reverted to a stable version tonight. I will ask the devs to test a coinpunk wallet. Can you PM me with some more details?
@_date: 2014-02-15 07:02:40
Yep, you sure can. Cafe  Imbiss 25 have been using DCPOS.com 's Point of Sale system to accept bitcoin for a month or so. Try the sausage rolls - seriously awesome homemade monsters with spicy relish. The coffee is excellent, too. If you visit Imbiss 25, why not do some shopping for funky streetwear around the corner on Acland St at Eclectico, or stroll up Carlisle St to Little Lost Land for funky sunnies and clothing.

No, but that's a great feature. I'll put in a feature request with the developers today!

Hi iNACTiVE1337, I am Mike from DC POS. If you would like to set up an account with us I will send you some bitcoin so that you can go and demonstrate to local businesses. We find that showing them is the most powerful tool. It is quicker than traditional swipe and pin cards.  We plan to translate into 6 or so languages in the coming weeks - so we will make German a priority. We knew that a big barrier for merchants was the ability to "cash out" (to fiat). DC POS supports payment processors in the SEPA (EU) zone (in fact gives you a choice of processors) so you should investigate those and find out which one gives the best options for your country and your merchants. You are to be congratulated for your enthusiasm - bitcoin needs young ambassadors like yourself. For reference material, you should memorise this [FAQ]( which has some well thought out answers to common questions. Go for it!
@_date: 2014-07-27 02:11:50
There are bars and cafes in St Kilda and the city accepting bitcoin. Clothing stores, bookshops, organic grocers, a sandwich franchise with four outlets, restaurants. Pubs, cocktail bars, a furniture store. Co-working spaces, eco-webhosting, opal sellers. Bicycles, fashion, podiatry, design. And for all of these merchants accepting bitcoin is easy, simple, and inexpensive.
@_date: 2014-05-14 12:23:53
Hey wilbursaurus, the app is free to download. There is a small percentage fee for transactions - much lower than traditional electronic remittance such as credit cards and bank debit cards. Fee payment is automated. You can learn more at

Hi - Mike from DCPOS.com here. We enable bricks and mortar businesses to accept bitcoin. Some good introductory resources are bitcoin.com (sponsored by the now defunct mtgox), and the FAQ at bitcoin.org is particularly well written and debunks some myths without resorting to boosterism. Andreas Antonopoulos is a clear thinker and this crash course video is excellent.

Oh Hi. At DCPOS we experimented with lots of tablets and stands. Here are some key learnings:
7" tablets are too small and fiddly. Get a 10", and a reputable brand. It's worth the money to get a samsung or an apple. It's really difficult to get a cheaper tablet that presents well on the counter. The big name tablets have countertop solutions that allow them to be plugged in all the time too. It's a bummer when you have a customer walk in and want to pay with bitcoins and your tablet isnt charged. We've also noticed that some businesses like to use their tablet for music streaming or whatever. Don't do this - its awkward for the customer when the music stops and the sales assistant has to fumble around unplugging the stereo. We found the least expensive option for mounting the tablet was a tripod mount. here's the ones we used on ebay:  . Here's a shot of this inexpensive yet reasonably presentable option in action:  . There are lots of retail POS stands for iPad; they are pretty pricey though. unless you are integrating bitpay with a POS systerm (DCPOS integrates seamlessly with VEND, a full POS system for tablets) then you probably dont want to drop a couple of hundred bucks on a stand. If you want to really minimise overheads, and your vet buddy has a nice large smartphone like galaxy 4S or a galaxy note, why not just run your POS application on that? Our solution presents really nicely on these screens. They have the advantage of always being connected to the internet, as well. We tried out some cheapo Chinese tablets in our beta testing phase, but they were no good for high volume merchants like bars. The screen surfaces aren't resilient, they scratch up quickly and look tired. Their network cards can be flaky also, in our experience. TLDR: Buy a 10" Brand name tablet, there are cheap mounts and expensive mounts; why not try a large smartphone at first.
@_date: 2014-05-19 06:10:22
My company DCPOS ( makes POS software available as a web app. We trialled a couple of dozen tablets. We had some success with circa $100 dollar Chinese tablets. We found that expensive tablets sometimes had problems the cheap ones didn't. There are QR Code libraries that just don't work with the new iPad screens, and the Galaxy 3 tab has browser stability issues. Units like [this]( actually worked really well for the money. The best hardware though is a client facing screen attached to your existing POS computer. PM me if you would like to chat about this and please feel free to demo our POS software :-) - Mike.

That's great - we have a bit of a plan to make our home city on of the biggest on the bitcoin map.
@_date: 2014-06-29 15:30:55
Yes, the slow "ding" is due to coinjar's off chain architecture. We are working with them to make it faster. Most other wallets get you the green tick in under 2 seconds.

I can confirm that Emily's bitcoin for yoghurt idea has lead to a hot lead for DC POS. The owner of a Yoghurt chain is interested, and We'll be talking to him soon and helping him accept bitcoin over the counter with our friends at Coinjar. It's great to see Coinjar fostering interest in bitcoin amongst the younger demographic.

Thanks for the additional details. Definitely sounds like coinpunk wallet has a problem.  The QR image reader coinpunk uses doesn't work well. It fails to scan good clear images of QR codes. We'll try to let coinpunk know and give them some technical details to assist them.

Melbourne, Australia is killing it. Check our town out on coinmap.org . POS systems need to remove the key barriers for merchants. Low cost. Ease of use. Intraday dollar for dollar hedging. Reconcile to bank the next day.

Hey thanks. We spent a lot of energy on not only creating a beautiful look and feel - we did a bunch of user testing to make sure the POS was easier than using a cash register as well. Useability will remain a focus for our stewardship of the product.
