i'm sorry i had to stop watching halfway through. once the iced creams were revealed i became incredibly anxious as one of them resembles my uncle and I owe him a lot of money after spending his savings on ether and then gambling it away trying to make a bitcoin

yeah this is a bad example. 
what you quoted is actually an argument in favor of having Yellow Cab operate under more antiquated rules and systems. 
this is like citing the federal insurance that savings accounts have that if the bank loses its money the federal government will reimburse you up to 100k. which is an argument for the safety/protection offered by the conventional banking system compared to a new currency infrastructure like crypto
