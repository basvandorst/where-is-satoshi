That's a bit stupid that they mention that on the ambassadors-page. I can't really find any information on when the ambassadors page went live. I just discovered it yesterday by a tweet from RSK themselves: r/[
edit: Actually, it's not the testnet anymore, it's mainnet now, not sure how long that's available

In electrum you go to RECEIVE tab. Never give out your master public key.
There is an address and a QR code. It has texts like:
Receiving address &lt;----- copy THAT address and nothing else. Should do the work.
Requested amount
By the way, I find it fascinating that you could find your master public key :p
Edit: that's not so hard I see now, it's in wallet information. But no, you don't need to use that key ;)

Started setting up a lightning node (again, hopefully working this time ;) ) with my Raspberry Pi. Almost downloaded the testnet blockchain. Waiting.. Next up: a mainnet node (if I'm absolutely sure I know it all works fine). Good to see there's an Android LN wallet now!

Thanks for the work! I used the guide a few weeks ago already, but didn't come past testnet (I wanted to copy the Bitcoin blockchain directly from one external harddrive to the one on the Pi using the Pi (much faster), but even though I was logged in as user 'bitcoin' for the copy action, there were writing rights trouble (I think) using the bitcoin blockchain (a LOCK would be generated, but that was it? so some user could write), I haven't had the time to figure out what went wrong and/or just copy it over the local network the way you describe in your guide (use Ubuntu though).

Took a while, but finally got some time to actually rtfm ;)
