I love this comment. I wish I was in the same position (of having the potential to cash out with so much gain), but I would have the same concerns as you if I was in your shoes. Why not cash some out and leave some?

It’s not possible to come up with anything original in this world anymore. I give up!

I can’t guarantee the price of bitcoin is tied to CoinBase but it’s definitely the main reason I got into cryptocurrencies. It was easy to get verified, easy to use and easy to buy currencies. It also takes AUD which a lot of exchanges don’t. I love the simple charts and it’s the main exchange I’ve recommended to friends. I have bug bears such as the lack of currencies on there, the fact it doesn’t display your returns in terms of a decimal or fraction equivalent (i.e “you’re currently at 2x your investment”), the cost they charge to buy currencies (I haven’t dabbled on the stock market so perhaps it’s similar?), the cost to transfer currencies (they wanted 1:1 price of my transfer amount just to do the transaction which is ridiculous!), and the lack of automatic buy or sell orders, but it is a neat app and it is pretty addictive. I’d like to see them improve on these things rather than switch to an exchange that doesn’t support half of CoinBase’s Australian features.

Is it possible to set up an automatic sell order so that when it hits $30k when you’re sleeping/in the pub you can be safe in the knowledge your transfer will take place? I wonder if most people do this and pick a round number then the market will shift as soon as it hits $30k on the nose!

So roughly a 5x return on investment? Not too shabby!

Nice looking exchange, but can only buy BCH, ETH and LTC much like CoinBase?

Great tips, thanks

Agreed. I’m in Australia and there’s not too many other options in terms of purchasing BTC using AUD to then buy altcoins. My plan was to transfer BTC from CoinBase to another exchange first, but the transfer fee is too high

There’s so many advantages to cryptocurrencies but I think people forget how difficult or cumbersome this is to the average person. Although there’s issues with a “centralised third party”, banks guarantee and insure your holdings, they make it easy to transfer and they don’t charge to transfer (at least in the UK and Australia where I’ve lived). There’s a lot of things with cryptocurrencies that make it difficult to exchange money such as giving someone a long random alphanumeric string that isn’t always easy to copy and paste. It’s easy to copy and paste the wrong bank details but surely with the rise of modern technology this should be a thing of the past

I think the problem exists with current fiat transactions. At least outside of America most people don’t pay to move money around unless it’s a foreign transaction or the amount is high enough to incur a fee. In the UK with faster payments or Australia with retail bank to retail bank transactions it’s all free. So if people have to start paying for transactions with cryptocurrencies then they’ll complain. And arguably so - it’s a regression not a progression. But at the same time it’s the only way to incentivise nodes on the network once mining has stopped and we’re at an inflation-less parity (assuming this happens). But then we’re a creative sort and maybe we can determine a cheaper method to enable transactions?
