The metric used to evaluate 'used to be smart and fast' is paramount to your analysis.
I can be a wizard in blockchain as it is now. If I chose not to learn or stay relevant for this entire year, I'd have no idea what the fuck I'm talking about in 2019.
As technology grows quicklier, the need to learn grows much more quicklier.
Stay relevant, or stay vulnerable.

Taking BTC donations to kill the forced Ghost Hunters viewing terrorists. As someone that helped fight ISIS I find this to be a superior mission

Not surprised Coinbase is condoning hookups. We all recently witnessed their affection for pump-and-dumps.
