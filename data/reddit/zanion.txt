Pretty much. There is a 'bits' value field too but it is of limited usefulness.

You can make sure your wallets are $0 since you of course transferred your assets into a secure storage wallet.

More than just a few companies diversify their holdings, I don't see why crypto assets would be any different. Will a portion of holdings be in fiat? Sure. Will 100% of the corporate holdings immediately converted to fiat? I find it extremely unlikely.

I have bought a significant amount of crypto without issues with USAA. You can even link the damn thing to coinbase and monitor your wallets.

Bitcoin and crypto threads are among the worst possible places to learn about quantum computing.

It's what the task proves not the task itself that is significant.

I find it hilarious to read. It's like a kindergarten class trying to explain things they don't understand to each other.

This link is a rare useful post in this garbage heap of misinformed comments.
Though the risk is more than the hashing algo, and the task to adapt requires significantly more than flipping a switch.

QC Cloud Platform:
 - 
Rigetti has a beta open for subscription but is primarily simulated based on what I understand
 - 
I've only personally used IBM's. The industry has adopted a strategy of leveraging a cloud facing service model to support and accelerate academic research in QI/QC.
You'll of course need at least some idea of what you are doing, you can't quite just set out with only a classical understanding of programming and obtain results. The resources I've used in my own study, admittedly geared towards AI/ML however still valid generally, are below:
 - 
This course focuses on IBM's platform and can help build understanding for using QISKit as the IBM platform leverages the QISKit SDK. 
 - Quantum Computation &amp; Quantum Information (Michael A. Nielsen) This is the tome essentially
 - Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists (Noson S. Yanofsky/Mirco A. Mannucci)
 - Quantum Computer Science - An Introduction (N. David Mermin)
 - Quantum Machine Learning (Peter Wittek)
 - Supervised Learning with Quantum Computers (Maria Schuld/Francesco Petruccione)
I've worked through these texts in addition to in-person institutional study to a reasonably large degree, though I do not hold a formal position as an academic QC researcher. I do have a very strong maths/physics educational &amp; professional background that has served as my foundation for study for this material. Essentially any text on QC will touch on Shor/Grover's algorithms and build to an understanding for them, assuming you have sufficient mathematical grounding to set out on the journey.
This is quite vague, proofs for any specific pq cryptographic algorithm would generally be presented within the research with which the algorithm is introduced. In the interest of pointing you towards more information, in addition to the above sources you could follow and check out the algorithms submitted to NIST:
 - 
You could also check out PQCRYPTO ICT-645622: 
 - 
There should be more than enough material here to keep you busy for awhile.

Quantum computing time is available via cloud services right now today. They are very public and serve to support research in the field.


Post-quantum cryptography is an active area of research, and yes, new and old PQ algos are based on mathematical proofs.
You know not of the things you speak.

It's rather self-evident that obsolete encryption schemes have known attacks.
Don't eat so much sugar cereal.
@_date: 2019-09-29 14:45:35
All encryption algorithms are those that have no known attacks. Yet.

Bitcoin maximal-ism at it's most hilarious. If you remove the sci-fi theme there aren't any original ideas in this post. Instanced blockchain networks already exist, cross-chain protocols already exist, ICO funding already exists.
I'm going to take a calculated risk and continue to move forward with the assumption that it's overwhelmingly improbable that that anyone alive today will actually have a pragmatic use case for interplanetary crypto-currencies.

It's the reality of the non-trivial obstacles inherent in the colonization of other inhospitable planets that limits progress. I'm simply grounded in reality.




Very "encouraging" response laden with rebuttals to statements and sentiments I never presented. Levy insults against those who disagree with your delusion. 
I guess I'm willing to let you have the last laugh when you're mining Bitcoin on Olympus Mons in 5 years.

I've had a change of heart. I fully encourage you to funnel all your time, energy, education, and money into this idea.
