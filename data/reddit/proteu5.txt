Well, I'm coming from a conservative stance. It really is great, but you always assume the worst. If you do your HW, the worst is still turning a profit. ;)
Ideally, if you're mining on 1TH+ You stand a chance to find a block, 25 BTC, in +/- 100 days. Not even factoring this, those numbers are guaranteed pool'd PPS payments.
Now this is the Giant, BTC, many alts pay out more than BTC, stability is lower, volitity is higher, but so are returns...but you missy stay on top of your game.

It's mathematically impossible to mine every coin. It decays exponentially past a block reward of 0.n so their will always be bitcoins being minted but your looking at a reward of 0.00001 for example. Most people calculate the end of a coin to its last half closest to the Zero Decimal. Unless the source code has if Subsidy &lt; 0; subsidy = 1 locking the reward in at 1, like WorldCoin.

There already is one in Europe. The day Mt. Gox imploded it was announced, and tragically, this news shadowed its launch. I forget the name, but I got the report somewhere between 9am and Noon on my feed. I'll try and find the article.
It's a Bank....and I use that term loosly, but it reality its a center of ATM terminals linked to their central exchange service. From what I had read, they called it a Bank for the 'NewComers' however, it offers a physical location, with a modern-quasi futuristic decorum. Imagine Coinbase having a physical HQ for Deposits/Withdrawals.

Hey, come on now, "show one man a junk yard and he sees, well a dump. Show it to another, and he sees profit in every tire."
My point, don't you feel so Damn smart when you put trolls in their place, and help people who are genuine but are getting trolled because they asked a simple question?
Every place has people like this, you can't run from them. But you can sell them ASICS. Anyhow, it won't last. Few more months and they'll be broke and give up; actually profitable and thus smarter with much less trolling; or just simply mad because their Linux won't install.
Btw, I hate forums where I need a post cont of *n to talk with the "Big Boys" the psychology of it is like in High School.
Right: Money where my mouth is; Similar to reddit,  Forum with a built in tipping system for people who help others out held in a weekly escrow that can be "Karmatically" deduced for trolling and bad behaviour. We now have a positive reinforcement incentive system, with a positive/negative reward system.

Keep security high, don't go cheap
What ever network service you use to connect to, make sure it's enough, You don't need down time 
Battery backup
I have no clue if the ATMs use WiFi but never, ever wifi. Dedicated line all the way.
Know everything inside and out about BTC lol I wish I knew more. How much do you know, and are you a store owner, coffee add shop owner? I would get a BTC POS system and an ATM if I owned a coffee shop.

Oh boy, welcome to the rabbit hole; If you continue reading my post there's no return...
Bitcoin Mining now has an expensive enterance barrier. Minimum hardware to turn a profit is $600 investment if your smart. You'll need 250ghs. At the end of this month you must sell or lease out that miner and upgrade. Repeate until you have 2-5 TH/S. Once there, cycle ever 3 months due to electricity. $250/mo where i live, 0.23 /kwhr.
Your alternative is Scrypt coin mining. Ie: Litecoin, Doge, Etc. Currently there are asic miners out. Because they are energy friendly and you don't have to worry about electricty right now, you can learn on Windows, but Linux and Pi are king.
Enterance Barrier: $2,000(Gridseed Blade) Will retun on investment 3-6 mo., contingent on ability and skill. After 6mo assume a small 10% decay in profit due to difficulty. 
Scrypt coins are very very easy to turn to BTC. Trade them like stocks.
Skill: what coin to mine, when to mine, when to switch, when to hold/sell.
Always use a pool unless you are mining a newly released coin or have a 0.1 to 10day chance of finding a block due to good hardware.
Stay up on all BTC/LTC News.
Mine Like its a business.
Always calculate your ROI and Profits:
-KNC Miners
Regardless of you investment you'll know when your successful when you reach BTC sustainability; the point at which you no longer need to spend cash because you're profits in BTC are enough for you to buy new equiptment with BTC each month, and hold a profit.
There's so much more, but have faith that no matter what you buy, there is a guide, and everything you may need extra is sold at R*Shack or Bestbuy.
Btw: Most people only convert 10% to cash to cover electricty and hold.
Legally: miners who mine on US pools are susposes to declaire to irs. Btc is volatile. You pc is usually safe,  But never store wallets on mining pc's. I can go on for days.
"Im glad I decided to dive in many months ago. I was just having fun, now I've learned 100x more than i could have in 1yr of college. So worth it, never exoecting to do good, i actually did. Have Fun, and good luck ;) "
- It will change your lives forever.
Edit: Forgot cooling; Hell yess! If you invest $10,000 its stupid not to spend $2000 more and risk burning out your rig. If small time, be a hobbyist A/C inventor haha.
Edit: More Vocab:
)Your CPU = 100hashes/sec
)GPU = 500kh/s
)USB Miner = 336.3 mh/s
)New U2 USB = 1.6 GH/s ($6.00/yr income...yea, if even)
)Cube = 30 gh/s plug into coinwarz 
)Antminer S1 = 180 gh/s currently 0.4Btc/mo but decay
)Antminer S2 = 1 or 2 TH/s 
Every 2weeks the difficulty of finding a block-25btcs, of BTC goes up with the NetworkHashRate, total hashing power of every miner. The higer the Diff. The less pay.
Different algorithm to mine different coins; SHA-256 is BTC.
Makes use of GPUs or Graphics cards, just recently ASICS began to ship.
)300khs = 6-9mo ROI
)2.5 mh/s can do $ 200/mo
)1000hash = 1kh/s
)1000khs = 1mh/s
)1000mhs = 1ghs
)1000ghs = 1ths
)1000ths = 1phs or petahash; BTC network is pushing quite a bit of these and exponientally increasing.
In SHA you want THS in SCRYPT mhs turn nice profits. Strongest is KNC at 300mhs.
NEVER EVER:
Buy from Amazon or Ebay until you check the current prices in BTC from BTC retailers. 90% of ebay sales are over priced, sold by people who didn't do their homework. That being said, I have been able to find quite a few nice deals on their for myself, but it takes a lot to patience.
)PPS= pay per share
)PPLNS= Pay per last n shares
)P2P = peer to peer mining
)DGM = capacitor based: you charge your account (ie: mmpool.org) &lt;&lt; My Fav.
Software (no manufacture supplied or miner embedded):
)GUI Miner - for for beginners
To Learn:
)Use Ms-Dos get away from GUI miners (better preformance)
).bat batch programming simple notepad codes to configure and run a farm of miners, great for organuzation

Yea, I would wait on KNC for a while because of this. Personally, blow $20.00 on an Antminer U2, call it "educational expenses" then if you're satisfied with the difficulty level look into the new Antminer S2.

On point 7., (just to add) the Gov't likes to use Iron Key self-destructing USBs; good investment btw, from Iron Key. They use SHA-256 enctyption; the same as BTC. Crypto's are bringing us to the end of the latest cryptographic advancements. I know if some alt-coins using SHA-3 for their core, higher than, "...my public domain limited knowledge...", the military uses. On legal stuff, I hate that topic, but it's Capital Gains as Property Assets.

Mehhh...Just showing that the market is finding its support level at 454.1
For "said" security to stabilize below, not just dip, it would have to accept that support price as now a new Resistance level. Basically, flip the chart around. If it took this long to "lets say crash" it would need an equally as long time to stabilize at this new price level. 
Anything can happen. I'm biased in a forward direction, so I try not to look at it as BTC, but Forex, USD/EUR

This is wonderful, but still, spoofing tradition payment systems will always be an issue. BTCs structure is much harder to steal from in every day use.

Wall St. analysts say $1,500.00. Like the Weather Man, they have to be conservative; so assume $2,000.00 within 1yr. Because they were slow to the game, I give them $1,000 more in % error (i have to math behind this). So my 1 - 1.5 yr call, $3,200.00. +200 because, Well I Love BTC. Well get stuck between 1,500 and 3,000 like we are now 300 to 500 because of China, and then our 5yr...welllllll why not $10,200.00 Haha.
But 3,200 in 1.5 years I can see with practicality.

I'm no master but, what version wallet were you on? After recent events, I'm sure anyone would want to first rule out anything HeartBleed related. The news came out days after your transaction. 
Also, in debug consol type: listtransactions see if your local wallet has evidence of the transactions. If so, all I can say for now is update. 0.9.1 and keep the wallet running.
Edit: As for your BTC=Void Dust...I think it my level out, I remember a few parts of BTC Core's source that aid in issues like these. It should adjust out, but I'll sit tight and wait to see what other people say and what happens.

I dislike the new symbol, but they are correct. I have wished countless times now that I had a 'B' symbol next to $. It makes sense why we need ASCII char., but we can't have the BTC logo that way on 'll keyboards as a standard.

 This should still apply to your model. A lot you won't need, but the networking set-up will be the same. 
As for your internet, you'll need to get your Laptop onto the same router as your Miner. The Rig needs to be connected via Ethernet, and the Laptop can be WiFi, but if possible Ethernet is more reliable. 
Worst case you'll just need to buy a 2nd cheap router to act as a Network switch if no ports are availabl since it is shared.
After everything is plugged in you can access your Miner via  (It's default address):××××(It's default port), from your laptop.
Once there, if Avalon doesn't have any Proprietary mining software, you'll need a Stratum Proxy or you'll need to configure BFG/CG-Miner to listen on port 8332 or your default port. The code looks somthing like: '--http-port 8332'  your '-o url:port' will be the Miner's local 192.168.1.* address. 
The guide gets very advances, but don't let it discourage you. You won't need a lot of it. Plus, you have a very nice miner.
@_date: 2014-04-13 21:44:40
You need to hook up the rig to the router via ethernet. Log into router, 192.168.1.1 and control from there. Typically, micro usb is for flashing only.

I'll start worrying at $35.00 USD. Don't forget, after every low there could be a buy-rally; followed off by a stabilization period.
You can look at it like any other security, If your Bullish here's how it looks:
1. Empty Glass :: $35
2. Pour Beer :: $1,500
3. Froth Settles :: $300
4. Drink and Repeat, but with more accuracy (You're A better Bartender)
5. Glass :: $325
6. Pour :: $800
7. Forth :: $500
8. Initial New Low :: $400
9. Stabilization In Volitility :: $550
10. Median Between Support &amp; Resistance :: $350?
11. Rally :: $600?

Agreed. You would use the API commands of a Blockchain website or run your own proof of concept Blockchain to gather data. I would data mine for accounts inductive 1yr+ and disregard all accounts over a $5,000 value. You could also cross referance the newly index'd accounts's TX_ID'S on your database with a Google search: [tx  [help] or an exact search of keyboards of people claiming dust or lost transaction. 
You could calculate a better upper-bound rule of $5,000 to determine at what value do people tend to hold an account at, like savings.
It's still broad but would be more accurate than no iinformation.  Again, all temp. Coimbase account addresses would have to be factored in as well, and the same for any temp. Deposit address used on any exchange. After that, get you % Error Deviation. It's atleast  something.

Oops Sorry! After a set period of time or in Cryptos, a number of Blocks which equate to time the reward for finding a block cuts in half. Currently, if I were to solo mine BTC and a Block, I would be rewarded 25 BTC. This is minting fresh new BTC. After 210,000 blocks the reward cuts in half ( 
The next cycle of blocks will reward miners and pools 1/2 * 25 or 12.5 BTC per block. Naturally, we assume we will hit the 21 million max coins. However, we will reach eventually a reward of 0.78125 per Block. 
At 50 per Block after 210,000 blocks: 10,500,000 coins created
At 25 " " :  5,250,000
At 12.5 " " : 2,625,000
At 6.25 " " : 1,312,500
At 3.125 : 656,250
At 1.5625 : 328,125
At 0.78125 : 164,062.5
Which brings us to a total current count of coins in circulation of: 20,835,937.5
Because we decay by one half each term at the same Block-Term time, not time; the amount of coins being minted will never reach 21,000,000.00. Use Exponential Decay to determine this, and you take the summation of coins minted per term where each term is a block halving cycle of 210,000 blocks. 
My 1st post is the actual C++ creating this model inside of BTC Core. Basically, "Bitcoin Will Live Forever." (Please, not speaking socially, just technically) 
Excel is a great tool to use to see this!
