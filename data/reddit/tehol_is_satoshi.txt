 A few large players like blockchain(dot)info and bitpay are purposefully refusing to implement. Draw your own conclusions as to why...
@_date: 2019-07-11 13:25:06
It's been years now they could have been working on upgrading to segwit. How many more years will it take to convince you there may be more to them refusing to implement then what you describe?  
Not wanting their customers to pay higher fees unnecessarily was the reason they gave for waging the blocksize war. Why is this no longer a pressing issue for them do you think?

it's the term for the 50/25/12.5/etc bitcoin miners receive for mining the next block.
@_date: 2019-07-08 14:30:28
Pretty clearly both imo
@_date: 2019-11-29 14:20:54
I think people are grossly underestimating how much things like lightning, liquid and batching will keep fees from skyrocketing.  
It was mostly exchanges that were clogging the mempool and caused fees to go high. They have solutions now to mitigate that.

Keep up the great work Peter!

Bitcoin having ~97% of the SHA256 hashrate is a fucking fact.  
Watch some videos / read some articles about how 51% attacks work. BCH isn't being 51% currently for two reasons (imo):  
1) It is unethical and the blowback to the mining pool(s) doing it would be fierce. They could, but it would be bad for long-term business (they'd have shown they were willing to attack the chain you're mining).  
2) It doesn't really make economic sense. A mining pool could continually 51% attack bch and cause havoc with the network, but then people would lose faith in bch and the price would likely plummet. It's more profitable to simply mine bitcoin and not have to worry about losing your reputation attacking another chain. Doesn't mean it can't happen at any moment though.  
I personally prefer to store my wealth on a chain that currently no single entity could hope to attack.

What binance needs is to fucking upgrade to segwit addresses
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:50:50
No, but might as well be.
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:57:56
Damn. That's cool.
@_date: 2019-08-23 18:58:15
There are several bitcoin mining pools who could 51% attack the bch network with ease, if they cared to participate in unethical behavior. Minority chains that share the same POW algo with bitcoin are inherently less secure and one of the major reasons people view bch as a shitcoin.
Luckily the unethical miners are largely the same folks that created and support bch, so they don't have to worry quite as much.
@_date: 2019-10-11 14:59:10
Yeah it's why Roger is able to prop up the bch price. 
He got stupid rich from not only buying bitcoin early, but also investing in tons of shit early like zec, xrp, bc.i, etc  
Kinda sucks but he'll run out of money eventually.

Smart money is slowly beginning to enter the game

"Supposed"? It's an open system. Use it however you want. Notice all the people in this thread donating?  
@_date: 2019-10-11 13:47:40


So to be clear - the biggest and most important change to the bitcoin protocol to date, isn't being prioritized BECAUSE OF FUCKING XRP?!?!!  
You say yourself 90% of your rev comes from bitcoin. Everyone says it, but it's surprisingly true - Bitpay is a truly shit company and deserves all the bad press it gets.
@_date: 2019-10-28 15:24:17
Nitrogen, hands down.  
Unless you are into props. In which case it would be the worst option.

Good post.  
Not sure about timeframes, but I believe in bitcoin and have my piece of the 21mm. I'm making a bet people will use bitcoin in the future, and I feel pretty damn good about it.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:45:10
Please don't waste your time on morons like this guy
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:34:49
2.2mb isn't very big...
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:28:43
Works (or worked?) for Bitpay. Nuff said. I hope he has fun playing with bcash and its big empty blocks with the other kiddies.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:43:45
He's the Joseph Goebbels of r/btc.  
(in the head of propaganda sense - not racism)
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:33:50
plus they're ~30% cheaper then normal transactions
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:08:46
LOLOLOL have fun with bcash retard
@_date: 2019-09-16 14:31:00
With the understanding that they shouldn't/can't be forced...why shouldn't they be judged? Blockchain(dot)info was one of the biggest bellyachers about how high fees were killing bitcoin (and said they were ready to roll out Segwit in 2017) and here we are in 2019 with a viable way to reduce fees...and they still haven't implemented it.  
Don't see why I shouldn't judge them for this.
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:55:46
I read the entire thing.  
I stand by my comment. Pay a dev to maintain a fork with BIP70 default if you care so deeply about it. Not rocket science.
@_date: 2019-09-06 13:47:11
Ask yourself this - why should xrp be worth anything at all?
@_date: 2019-09-24 18:50:04


This is one of the stupidest comments I've seen on reddit.  
And that's saying a lot.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:05:22
Wtf why is it ridiculous?
