If you need the money then sell.  If you don't then it comes down to; do you believe in Blockchain?
I do but maybe I'm crazy*.  I think if you hold for a long time you will make more.
* I am

Everybody thinks down so expect it to go up.

It could very easily stay around this price range for months.  I think the best strategy is do a bit now and a bit later.

That will not happen.  I'll buy all the BTC if it gets anywhere near double that.

Classic Friday pump. Still loves it though.

I think last weekend was more people not buying as they were waiting for G20 news.  This weekend we will moon*.  I think it will stay round these numbers for quite some time.
*We won't

Why has no one mentioned this before!? Oh wait, they did absolutely loads.  
Bit odd.

After feeling a bit despondent because of the obvious manipulation I went backed and looked at previous weekly/daily charts and I thought everything looked pretty similar to now.
As someone who has dabbled in BTC for a few years but not watched as closely as I do now, can any old timers confirm what we are seeing now is what we have always seen?

My man!  We still going down?

I have a question because I know nothing about trading.  Why do all coins follow BTCs lead?  
Surely not everyone is selling EVERYTHING right now?

People are getting bored of market manipulation.  Whoever is doing it is killing the game.

Nailed it.

But what if I believe in the people running the businesses I invested in, and had no intention of selling for years?
Immoral?  It doesn't feel it.

But are we still popping, Mr Bubble?
