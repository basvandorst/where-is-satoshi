$20 after ATH and he was correct - actually said something like “don’t buy if you can’t handle a low of $20, etc.”
Too lazy to link to the tweet

Totally, but you got me curious, so this was from 12/11/17:
“[...] I expect us to have a multi-year bear market like the one we just had where LTC dropped 90% in value ($48 to $4). So if you can't handle LTC dropping to $20, don't buy! ��”

Wondering if you are referring to two of my favorites: LTC, XRP, IoTA

Jesus... I get the question was a bit dense, but such agro trolls. 
Isn’t the real “crime” being robbed by tuition?

Correct, I was using common nomenclature when referring to currency, but all good, I get why you got salty... FYI, I wasn’t just referring to 1 country.
“Dollar (often represented by the dollar sign $) is the name of more than 20 currencies, including those of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Jamaica, Liberia, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, Taiwan, and the United States. The U.S. dollar is also the official currency of the Caribbean Netherlands, East Timor, Ecuador, El Salvador, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Zimbabwe.”
However, I will stand by my statement as I was referring to an investment strategy.  Just NEVER heard of the way you referred to it.  “Pound-cost averaging (in the UK), and, irrespective of currency, as unit cost averaging or the cost average effect.”

*Dollar-Cost Averaging is the official term.  Not to be snarky, just think its appropriate when discussing serious issues ala financial investing

Semantics - still taken advantage of, but agree two wrongs do not make a right; just playing devils advocate
