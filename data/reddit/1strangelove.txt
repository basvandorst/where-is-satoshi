Are you sure? By that, I mean, have you had success yourself or is it what you heard? If you have had success, when was it and what was (about) the amount u purchased?

Checked out the site. It looks like an awesome way to buy and sell coins. Are you treating it as a trading site or just a way to buy into coins? Checked out that lets you buy and sell locally also that was posted in the comments on this thread. Love both those concepts. Another one I was reading about that's really new is Ripple. I like the lending out and earning interests on small payments part of that. For now, I'm just going to watch for what people's experiences are with that one tho. Think I'm going to buy thru BitFloor as you have suggested. I like the depth i'm able to take if i choose or being able to keep it all simple. Thanks for the advice.

It's over 3 weeks for me and I STILL HAVE NOT RECIEVED FUNDS!!!! Email them? Sure! Response? NONE if you got ur funds thru BitInstant then ur are one of the 1st I heard to have done so in weeks!
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:16:45
my next service provider will be bitfloor and then that goes into BTC-e, from there buy into Mt. Gox. At least this seems to be the common consensus amungst everyone. then again, heard the same for BitInstant till they got the Hack that seems to have done more damage from the bad PR and shitty customer service follow thru then the cost of the money they got robbed of. i genuinely feel bad for everyone still dealing with that mess, and despite my anger (guess it's way easier for me set that anger aside then you, obviously and understandably) feel bad for BitInstant. The role BitInstant plays, in the story of the start of BitCoin will be much larger then a footnote. sucks to watch.

What is that link? A store with all bit coin products?
@_date: 2013-03-21 19:19:30
Exactly the same with me except it was $150. BitInstant had excellent reviews previously during my 3 week research learning about BitCoin. However, when i deposited my money was about the same time as the time they got hacked. Here i am weeks later with only very little response in week one and 3 weeks later with calls and emails gone unanswered. I'm now researching fraud laws and visiting there NYC office as soon as i'm back up north.     
@_date: 2013-03-19 03:54:33
Exactly why I'm do my best from freaking out. Even offered to help em.
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:07:07
Yes, the signs have been there for weeks. About 3 weeks. In fact, the signs started about the hour I purchased my 1st attempt at buying BitCoins. Before that, everything I saw said great things about both the service and convenience of buying them. Guess I should have bought the crystal ball that was for sale on the counter at CVS that said on the box that I could see into the future with instead. Now for 3 weeks wanting to buy more BitCoins I simply have no reason to trust any reviews I read anymore. I'm severely let down by this experience with BitInstant :-(
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:10:36
I'm in south Florida doing a job and live just outside Philly, Pa. You bet ur damn ass I'm not letting this go either. I'm going right to there NYC offices as soon as I'm back north for a calm word and if that don't work I'm not going to play "Nice and understanding guy" anymore. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 22:24:54
I don't know how you guys are getting service thru them. I can't even get them to return emails or a phone call after a $150 buy thru them over 3 weeks ago right before they got hacked. Its been over a week since i got a response and that was on this subReddit. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:51:04
Thanks and likewise :-)
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:52:11
I'm shocked that Bank Of America even does this honestly. I've always viewed them as the bad guys in banking. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 20:08:01
The non reply from them is enough to suspect that that's not what happened. (just my opinion)
@_date: 2013-03-16 22:36:35
Wait, I'm confused now. BitInstint and ZigGap use ZipZap to do the exact same process and yet ZipZap is the one doing all the "Work"? Does this mean the $150 I paid for over 2 weeks ago and still can't seem to get my BTC despite BitInstints silence for a week and a half till last night on this site they said they'd fix it ASAP and once again have gone speechless. Should I be on the horn with ZipZap over this matter? I'd like to know both so I aim my disdain in the right place and get this matter solved once and for all. It just seems so odd that u can say service is all peachy and BitInstints has been sporadic to non-existent for over a week now while maintaining actions that are loudly screaming just how poorly they view a majority of there customers personal financial matters as being of very little importance to reach out and offer answers or ask for sincere patience over this long and unending emotional rollercoaster ride with sporadic rumers in the BitCoin Rumer Mill thats spouting off bits of news that only raise more questions and worries then giving any answers that even demestrate a hint of half heartedness and understanding.
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:52:32
Thanks, I'm going to look into them. Did it involve linking your bank account? I'm worried because I recently found out that my Drivers I.D. Expired earlier this month. Now I'm worried that it will prevent linking my accounts to anything. I can't renew that till I'm back in PA and that's going to be awhile it seems cause I'm now stuck in Florida seeing Drs over some kidney stone attacks that started since I got here preventing me from driving the 19hrs I need to do to get home on my own. It's just raining problems lately for me :-(  [Yes, TMI and Whiney]
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:34:31
I'm also noticing a lot of posts getting added to this subReddit that are new and praising how fast and easy the service was and I've been replying with my story to each one only to get no response from most people. I think they're setting up accounts to try and fake reports that the service is solid still. 
@_date: 2013-03-17 01:44:13
I probably should've re-read and edited that before i hit send. 
My 1st point was thanking you for giving a really clear explanation on how ZipZap works. Till now I was wondering why the need for all these companies needed to even exist when ZipZap was the processor.
My 2nd point was saying how I hope everyone in the BitCoin Exchange markets are taking notes on how the customers, ecommerce and BitInstant themselves are reacting to this problem they're experiencing. BitInstant took a $12,000 seminar on IT security, customer service and public relations and other people in the same field should have disaster relief plans drawn up to be prepared for any kind of mistake or hack that's bound to happen again. Where there's money, there's people always going to try and some will take it. Hopefully people learn as many things from what to do and not to do off of BitInstants current crises. In the long run, how these get handled later will really have an impact on the BitCoin market consumer confidence level and will keep the markets turning downward again.
The last point was saying how great this community is. Everyone that's involved from mining to selling and verifying really showed there true dedicated spirit in stopping as soon as a problem was noticed. You'd think (I'd have expected) someone would've taken advantage somehow and that didn't happen when the forking mistake was noticed in just minutes of it occurring. This was a side point I was making from the BitInstant point I saying. 
Oh, I also brought up that a lot of people are talking of other hacks, scams and all types of ways I don't even understand fully to steal money from any BitCoin site vulnerabilities or consumers making simple mistakes cause they don't understand everything yet. Myself is included in this group, unfortunately, however I only seem to learn from mistakes I made or seen others do.
Thanks again for taking the time to answer me and I hope this clears my points up enough for you. Though most of this was just me venting my obsession with BitCoins to people that may care a little. If you look at my comments and how long I've been on reddit. You'll notice that I never spoke up on any other subject till this one or contributed a single post. That's how much I care hahaha
@_date: 2013-03-19 03:55:53
Sorry to hear that. I guess, be glad it was only a $20?
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:10:09
Sounds dreadful! Glad they paid you. I got paid, however not at the time of purchase price and the fee waived like they said. got customer support response saying "sorry, you'll have to get that done thru the CEO. Good Luck!" nice. still pales in comparison as to what u went thru.
@_date: 2013-03-16 04:10:10
Sorry for my delayed response. Thought I would've gotten an email alert. Spent all that time writing an email to the job posting for customer support u listed 21 days ago :-)
Here is the account # 314 630 195
Hope that's what you need. Would you like me to send another coin wallet hash tag from my BitChain wallet? 
@_date: 2013-03-19 20:46:47
Thanks, I'll give that a shot. Just called and emailed there "Live Support" again with nothing answered again. Noticed they have a much sterner message now. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 06:06:22
I couldn't agree more! Except, I was buying it at about $35 at the time. CoinBits seems to be reviewed good. ZigZag is the same as BitInstant in the process and OkPay(?) I think is the name that REALLY sounded awesome, but the froze BitCoin sales since the hack. I could be wrong on names, and if I am, Other more knowledgable BitCoin Redditers are encouraged to correct me if I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2013-03-16 02:11:07
Guess I'm in the 30% that didn't get them yet. Considering the hack happened just around the time I purchased. Really glad the servers are back up and running again. I felt bad for you guys in week one. Week two and no response to further emails (3 across this week), I was a BitPissed. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 01:09:41
I have a macmini server with 16 gigs of ram an i7 processor, 2.5 terabyte HD sitting in a data center that so far hasn't had anything other then down time for planed maintenance. I pay monthly and love it, i'd like to offer free hosting to the endeavor. Not much of a system admin meaning i'd need to be walkthru the set-up process. But my lack of knowledge would cease if you help me learn this and the unforeseen stuff from ddos and what not. I'm down. 
Pm me
 
@_date: 2013-03-17 00:36:48
That was very well worded and I thank you for your quick and clear reply. ZipZaps roll in this makes much more sense now. I've been following BitCoin News for over a month now and ZipZaps name kept popping up and it really made no sense why another layer was really needed to be added. I can see that they are or will be a very important roll for lots of bill claims then simply existing for BitCoin charges. Many thanks again and I hope BitInstant's troubles are seen by the BitCoin Commerce community on how to handle future issues by learning from what they could have or did do, too make storms such as this easier to be prepared and ready for unpredictable weather while hopefully building on and maintaining an even stronger marketplace. Lots of servers, exchanges and wallets seem to be getting attacks with this recent wave of publicity. It's awesome to witness this all happen right now. Cooler still is how the BitCoin Peer2Peer network is self correcting any issues with so many checks and balances being done by people who genuinely care about mistakes and halting to correct them. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:30:43
apologies for my assumption. 
@_date: 2013-03-22 19:31:23
They suspended ur account!? I noticed that all my tickets have been closed and resolved. All but 2 have had a response saying that they'll need to get back to me with an answer. That sucks, what they did to you. I'm wondering and debating if it's worth building a case against them for fraud. I don't think it'd be to difficult finding other BitInstant victims off this subReddit forum alone. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 18:45:16
No worries ;-) My reaction was overly dramatic and wasn't the best way to have responded. I apologize for my over reaction. I've been a Bit too emotional over everything in my life from this experience.
