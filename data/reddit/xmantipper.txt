Doesn't GEM offer an API to embed wallets into other applications?

It would be cool to take a vacation to Venezuela and spend bitcoin.  I wonder how hard that would be?
@_date: 2015-06-09 21:45:22
Cool.  Is it available in NY with the Bitlicense now in force?

Ya, nice retort.  Have a biscotti on me @_date: 2015-01-15 15:19:26
Nice story.  Here's $1 tip @_date: 2015-01-14 19:40:39
Great thought, and it makes sense.  That would put our price back near $20, plus two years of growth.  So I think $50 not too far off from the "real" bottom.

Nice post. $1 @_date: 2015-01-14 19:49:18
Yup, probably right.  Have a biscotti @_date: 2015-01-14 18:54:05
I love Expedia.  I stay in hotels about once/week and always pay in bitcoin.

I hadn't expected people to disagree with the principle that exchange operators shouldn't trade on their own exchange.  It's pretty well accepted.  Let's me give an example of how asymmetry of information gives the operator an unfair (and typically illegal) advantage.
So everyone can see the order book, but only the operator can see WHO posted the orders.  This gives them an advantage during periods of high volume/volatility.  If the price is moving up, and most of the asks are from a single buyer, then the operator knows that the bull run will likely end when this one user's massive buy is consumed.  This is not true if there are many buyers collectively exerting upward pressure.  
The ONLY trader who knows this is the exchange operator.  This gives them a tremendous advantage in timing the market ups and downs.  That's why it's generally not permitted.
I'm not saying that Coinbase can/will do this, but they could.  As such it's a conflict of interest and should be frowned upon. I'm sure the regulators will, but the community should too.  We've had enough crooked/incompetent exchanges to demand a proper one.  
Coinbase's effort is a good start, but I think it's a job incomplete.  Spin off the buy/sell business and do it right.

Nice post.  Here's a $1 tip @_date: 2015-01-28 15:56:48
Ok, I think I'm on a roll.  What other illegal stuff could an exchange operator do if they also trade?  
They could front run.  So a normal user looks at the order book, decides they like the price, and place a market order.  The exchange/trader sees the incoming market order, puts a limit order in from of it, and scoops up a tiny profit. Repeatedly.  This is the essence of HFT (coupled with balancing risk-free trades on other exchanges), and could be easily executed by an operator.
Read Michael Lewis's book Flash Boys if you want a more detailed description.
Yes, operators trading on their own exchanges should be totally illegal.

That's probably a good thing.  We're still way under 1% of fees from transactions instead of inflation.  It'll have to rise eventually.
What's the average per transaction?  If it's still affordable, then it's likely not a problem.

I sent you a little bitcoin.  Enjoy!
@_date: 2015-07-26 13:45:01
Cool service.  Anything that makes bitcoin more usable is good.  Nice creative idea, I love the innovation in this space.
One suggestion, make your wallet non-custodial.  Get rid of the honey pot for hackers.  I understand the attraction of removing the double-spend fraud vector by holding all bitcoin centrally.   You could run this thing with zero confirmations, when all the transactions come from a wallet of your design (and you don't allow double spends).

Reselling Bitcoin without registering with FinCEN and following the BSA and Patriot acts is illegal.  I believe it's a felony (see Charlie Shrem).  Coinbase (and their bank) is responsible for monitoring your transactions, investigating potential illegal behavior, and reporting it through the SAR mechanism.
The reason the margins are so high is because it's illegal.  
@_date: 2015-04-26 15:37:40
I think this just highlights the need for non-custodial services.  You don't have to worry about a financial institution stealing/losing your funds if they can't.
@_date: 2015-04-24 21:09:36
While this article is not specifically about bitcoin, I immediately thought of the awesome implications it could have for cryptocurrency adoption.  If they start charging everyone to hold USD, then I think more people will turn to BTC as a store of value.  It's very much like the inflation that's gripping other countries (Russia, Argentian, Venezuela), but now in the US.  Thoughts?

They aquihired their dev team to AirBnB (there was an article in CoinDesk about it).  The technology platform is still for sale, and one or two leftover devs maintain it, but my impression is that the company is basically dead.
If you have money in Changetip, you may want to withdraw it.

Here's the link to the article:
Notice that this was an acquihire.  This means that they tried to sell the company for the value of its product and customer base, but no one wanted it.  So they "sold" their engineering team instead.  It was likely the best that could get, a worst case liquidation scenario.
Clearly they're not "going strong," haha.  
Notice that the code is still for sale.  Anyone could buy it, and control the value in custody at the service.  I heard a couple of crypto-devs didn't want to work at AirBnB, so they're likely maintaining the site.  Maybe they'll find a white knight...
It's a shame, they were a cool startup that didn't make it.  Not enough Bitcoin users.  Not enough tips for a real business.  Same thing happened to merchant services.
Just an FYI...

This is pretty standard KYC/AML behavior required by law.  Every regulated exchange must do this (Circle, Kraken, Gemini, SnapCard, itBit, etc).  Coinbase doesn't decide what's impermissible, they just follow the law.
Your best bet is to move your coin to a non-custodial wallet after buying it.  Then no one can censor your transactions.
The other option is to complain to your congressperson about the BSA and Patriot acts.  If these laws are repealed, the monitoring would become unnecessary.  Not much chance of that imo, people are more afraid of terrorism than government surveillance.
BTW - If they identify anything "suspicious", they'll submit a suspicious activity report (SAR) to FinCEN.  The most common SAR is for operating an unlicensed money service businesses.  So if you buy the max every month and sell on local bitcoins.com, they probably identified and reported you.
@_date: 2016-07-08 00:47:52
Sounds like a pretty standard AML investigation.  Regulated exchanges (and all financial institutions) are required to do this sort of thing.  It's the law in the US.
If you don't like it, I'd suggest writing your elected representative and ask them to repeal the Bank Secrecy and Patriot Acts.

It would be interesting to have moderation metrics.  If moderators hide/ban more than a Reddit approved threshold, then they can be subject to a removal vote by the sub's subscribers.  The voting likely needs to be weighted by Reddit users contribution to the sub (account age, number of posts/comments and value judge by community, number of thumbs up/down, etc), so it's hard for bad actors to manufacture a vote.
