It says "'electrum' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file"
I downloaded 'elec101e' and it says it is 'flatfly compact build', if that helps.

Right, I did this and chose 'Restore'. Entered my mnemonic and was given the rather worrying message "I cannot decode this".
What now?

Right, it seems I did have the seed wrong (I still may have it wrong, in which case I am very screwed..) and one of the words I had jotted down is not one of the 1626 words used. 3 other words are very similar though so I'm not giving up hope yet. Although I'm having problems getting to the "restore" point where one enters the 12 words now, a "seedless" wallet generates, even after deleting everything to do with electrum that I can find (ideas?). And just so you know, it is a non-trivial amount of BTC, in the region of a month or two worth of my savings.
I feel very very very silly. There is a dividend in this if I ever get my bitcoin back. And thanks again for all your help thus far Julian702, and everyone else really.

It turns out every word is NOT there, and this seems to be the source of my problem. There are 3 words very similar to the one I must have written down incorrectly. Thanks for this list, we're making progress. 
Now though I'm having problems deleting the old system files and restoring the wallet. The "seedless" wallet just starts and gives me no option to enter the 12 words.

Turns out I didn't check thoroughly enough and one word that I had recorded is not there (deep sigh, call myself a twonk). This word is very similar to 3 words that are on the list though so I'm not giving up hope yet. Now I'm having problems restoring.

Yes, every word is there.

Could you give me the details of another program that could hash locally?

Problem solved. Human error once again (Give control to our machine overlords I say, the sooner the better). Massive thank you to everyone who gave help, especially DiThi - cheers dude or dudette.

Yeah I thought this might be a bit iffy so I didn't do it. I've just enlisted the help of one of my techy friends who is going to cast his eye over this later. I'm a little worried, it is a non-trivial amount of bitcoin......

The word that was recorder incorrectly was "bud". I've now tried "mud" "buy" "busy" "bump" "bus".... and am still frantically trying other combinations.

Originally it was elec101c. I deleted everything and reinstalled elec101e and had the "I cannot decode this" message.
I restored elec101c, ran it, and tried entering the mnemonic again at "Restore" and got "I cannot decode this" once more. The list of words is definitely correct - I'm positive - but what about the "Gap Limit"? What does that signify? Thanks again for your help Julian702

The wallet was running perfectly, with my incoming transaction visible. I tried to send a payment and it told me that the password (which I had written down with the seed when I created the wallet) was incorrect.
I then tried to recover the wallet from its seed, thinking that would be no big deal. And here we are. Any more suggestions?

it's close to midnight and something evil is lurking in the dark
