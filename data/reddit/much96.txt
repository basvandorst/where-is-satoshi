I am the opinion we should change our thinking. Not Bitcoin is going to the moon but FIAT (especially USD) are going down to 'hell'. Soon the question will be how many Bitocoin (or better Satoshi) is a USD and not how many USD is a Bitcoin.

So, why is this not in the media or discussed openly???

So question: Do you need to report FBAR if you have a ledger nano S in your safe which is located in the USA? Is considered this considered as a foreign account?

In my opinion this is the wrong thinking. We are not selling bitcoin. The vision is to go away from Fiat. This means that maybe by 2020 I will start spending Bitcoins or pay invoices with Bitcoins. I am not an investor. I feel better having my money in BTC than on my bank account where I lose 50% every 10 years.

Exactly. That's why i am worried for Bitcoin.

Can somebody explain to me why I should open a lightning node except of interest?

I have 20 employees and i can guarantee you nobody will accept bitcoin.

It seems in their previous FAQ you could transfer out your bitcoins. see video at 8:12

In my opinion this is a very good question. I am also eager to set up a network with my customers and my suppliers. We as a group transfer a lot of USD around the world. I would love to cut down the transfer time from many days to seconds. This would improve cash flow a lot. Not talking about transfer fees... Another advantage: I am sure you had customers who promised to transfer money. You wait 3 days and you get nothing. You contact back the customer and they report that there was a glitch during transfer and they will make another tomorrow. With LN all this could be solved. Reading above posts it is a pity we need to wait weeks or maybe months to be honest.

Node.acinq.co is the node we have to use? What is the min funding?

Sounds great. But how do you certify that it is a particular/ genuine/ same base ball card (for example) which you are buying and the one which is on the block chain? The used Rolex has a serial number.
@_date: 2018-12-09 18:09:01
Looks interesting. I will try it out.

Thank you for the explanation. 
I agree the question is who is going to enforce it but following situations with a used Rolex:
1. Rolex got stolen. Original owner has seed at home. He enters phrase in app or on website of company and declares the watch stolen. If the thief tries to sell the watch to a jeweler (assuming he is using this system) he will be caught because the watch is declared stolen.
2. Person ready to buy an used Rolex either jeweler or private person. He checks thru app if the watch is marked stolen. If not seller provide a code on his phone and the buyer scans. Buyer receives new seed and is marked on the block chain that he is the owner.
The company makes money asking for a little fee for every transaction.

Sorry. Not sure I understand you correctly. I got a new phone and transferred from pixel2 to pixel3. Everything was transferred to new phone. when started eclair I had to select new wallet or restore. entered my seed and wallet was restored. but no funds there.

The problem exists already today with counterfeits. But when you buy a used Rolex from a sound jeweler you can be sure it is genuine. This app would solve the problem if a watch is stolen or not. Or take a used iPhone. I am sure the app could recover the unique serial number of the phone. No 3rd party needed.
