No not that much, you can buy some used stuff/electronics in Akihabara but no food or accomodation

Currently living in Tokyo and you can see people selling used goods (iphones/mac etc) for BTC. If you go to Akihabara you ll see some stores accepting BTC :)

Well spoken! I drive a 2010 Polo and I do not need to change it until it works ;) Cars (unless vintage) are some of the worst investment you can make. Drive 30km and from new you lose instantly 30% of their value. Unless they are your hobby/passion it is not worth spending 100/200k on it, better to buy a 2nd apartment to rent or dividend paying stocks

did you mistake a Doritos ranch for a chilly flavor in one of those triangles? I do hope it touches 5k$ as I have some orders just in case but still maintaining 6k$ support

@_date: 2018-08-27 07:42:53
short answer: No
Long answer: Not at all ;)

it is always a little later than that as majority of stocks are held by few funds/banks (Aka Facebook with Swiss banks) once they decide it is time to sell you will see some 20% drops, as long as it is single entities is not too worrying, problem comes when is the entire market who wakes up with overvaluation

Apart from knowing where they are has anyone here actually used any of them? Would you happen to know the fee %? 
Might be cheaper than withdrawing directly to banks!
@_date: 2018-08-27 07:46:30
it would be a really cool neon to have!

you would sell OTC (over the counter) directly with private people who want to buy without having an impact on market price :)
Some exchanges allow you to do OTC trading, ah that is 1 BTC for the info heheh ;) I could put you in contact with OTC market makers (they group different buyers into one single order)

Amazing to see them being spread around! hopefully they will be used!

most likely instead of using 0.000000.... you ll say 31 satoshis

Microsoft is one of the biggest sponsor of the ETH alliance. 
Bill Gates might not be in the CEO company anymore but the future is heading there and he previously talked about BTC with high regards. 
Warren Buffet always said that he never invest in an asset such as gold where the gains are there if someone will be willing to pay more in the future for it (aka majority of coins now), plus he rarely invest in tech so why should he differ now. 
I am personally a huge crypto supporter and investor since early 2014 but give the man some slack. They both have been remarkable in what they did :)

I dont think you can recover a lost wallet by any means...
@_date: 2018-08-27 07:44:16
put it in a decent container/tower and dont think it is going to have any profitability... unless you try to mine new coins and hope for the moon
@_date: 2018-05-09 05:49:44
it always goes lower/higher than expectation... like trying to catch a falling knife :)
@_date: 2018-08-02 17:49:02
Alcoin all move equally more or less, beside ETH, EOS and a few others all are doomed to disappear. Sill want them to moon one last time :D
@_date: 2019-02-04 05:42:34
Thats if you think BTC is unique and only crypto available, i do not really see scarcity with ETH, EOS, LTC and other BTC forks around. Do not think scarcity is any reason for price, you can always divide them up if needed...
