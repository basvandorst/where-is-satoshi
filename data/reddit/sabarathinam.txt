Hi, could you please let me know, how to wire transfer to coinbase inc account? Is there a way to directly wire transfer to coinbase inc account(metropolitan commercial bank/where they have account with) by signing in to my coinbase account? Or do I have to sign into my personal bank account (ex- chase,bank of America,us bank etc) and send the wire transfer? I am very confused.because When I tried to send wire transfer by logging into my coinbase account it initiates the beneficiary bank(metropolitan)and beneficiary(coinbase inc) info, but I don't find any option to send/confirm the wire after that. But it shows two option under the initiated info. 1. I have send the funds. 2. I will do it later. And where to type my reference number in the wire transfer? Please help me.
