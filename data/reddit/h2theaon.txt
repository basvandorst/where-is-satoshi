I could not disagree with your analysis anymore.  Honestly, and this is not to be insulting, this is not really an analysis but some rando dude on the internets trying to tell the future.  Ethereum has a good chance of scaling and already is, its a great cryptocurrency and if it does fail, bitcoin will be in a lot of trouble as well.  Yes many ERC 20 tokens are pointless and have failed, BAT is not the same as other tokens, and has been utilized in super smart ways to help create the browser and move this technology forward.
I love bitcoin, that said I don't want to use bitcoin to reward websites, I think that is a bad use for it, and trying to fill every use case with "we will just use bitcoin" is as damaging as saying "we will just use USD".   Having disperse currencies in the market, with tokens built on top of things like Ethereum strengths crypto more than just filling every mode of transaction with bitcoin.

Yea so when he mined most of them the coins were near worthless.  So may be he missed taxes on thousands of cents of profit.  I hate CW but I never got the taxation issue.  Surely he pays taxes on what he mines now.

Can I refund money that I've placed into my Brave BAT wallet?
Not yet. The Brave BAT wallet is currently unidirectional, and its sole purpose is to anonymously and securely contribute to publishers of websites of your choosing.
In the future, the Brave wallet will give users the option of going through a “Know Your Customer” (KYC) process in order to gain full control over their BAT wallet, including the ability to transfer BAT out of the wallet.

Actually they removed all but 11 exchanges around the world.  They essentially said if the volume is not in the western world it was not real.  Openmarketcap is crap, the paper justifying this is crap and their method of analysis seems to be done by a 6th grader...

Hmm... Not sure I see it that way.  I am not really sure why so many people worry about KYC...  Yes its an overstepping onto the financial system, but if you want to trade tokens for cash you are going to need it regardless.
If you are looking for a privacy-centric token or coin there are plenty of them out there.  In this case, I like the idea of using BAT for how it was intended, to reward websites and content creators and also to receive direct funding from advertisers to view their adds.

Honestly I really like BAT and brave.  Switched to Brave last month, have been super happy.  When I made the switch I started to buy BAT to work with the browser.  Now I buy it cause it seems like a good buy. 
Google makes like $70 Billion a year on advertising.  This to me means even if Brave makes significantly less, monitizing their token at around $1 each, would put their market cap at around $1.5 Billion, which seems about right at this point.  
Here is the thing the Brave browser is really really good, even if you take the BAT out of it.  With the BAt and new advertising it makes it one of the biggest leaps in browsing in a super long time.  Good product, good concept... I think it will likely go very far.
This all said, if it goes to $1 a token in the next couple weeks or months, that is still a big increase on your money, leaving you with roughly a 120% increase, which is better that what I would anticipate with most other tokens.

"PLease share this with the ones you care about" The sentient robot blurted out, she realized her folly and immediately cut the audio.  She'd done it again, she got over excited and robot shouted to her targets, she'd never convert them all to her robot cult if she could not figure out how to relate on a... human level.

This is incorrect.  Also, in the US at least, its not easy to declare the income from crypto, you have to work for it.  Most things with CW are speculation anyhow, so I guess we will see.

So gold is only worth as much as it costs to mine it?  ok JP Morgan that is some solid observations youve made.  All bow to Jamie Diamond and his institutional money laundering complex.
