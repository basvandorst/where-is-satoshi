Of course, hence the inherent issue in trying to ride the wave and not get (metaphorically) killed in the process.

Seriously.  I am very hands-off on the entire crypto game these days after making a ton of cash on BTC buying in on most of my holdings at &lt;$150, selling back a few months ago before the big-time correction.  
With the way that things have been up recently, I made the choice 7-10 days ago or so (it's hard to keep track of with how things have been changing) to buy at ~6000.  Not that much, but enough that these changes are going to make a nice holiday season for me as I'm going to cash out now and not risk anything stupid.  For my good fortune I'll have to donate half of the profit to the people affected by the fires here in LA.

This is exactly what CEX.io did about a week and a half-two weeks ago.  Just a few days after I got confirmed on there (anyone here use them, by the way?) they completely blocked any new account creation as well as any new account verification/confirmations, only people with existing account verifications in process could proceed.  Since they did that, the delays in just about everything has come down significantly.

Purify for iOS is the way to go, no jailbreaking mess required. Ghostery is worth taking a peek at, too.

Ripple is XRP.  There are many factors in my opinion that lead to it being among the most stable options out there, even right now, and a great option for long-term sustainable growth.  Most importantly is the incredible technology built into their processing network, claimed capable of being able to scale out to the same size as Visa's processing network (currently 50k per second), they're already doing 1500 per second, reliably, consistent 24/7 whereas the speeds for BTC and ETH are prohibitively slow.  XRP payments finalize in 4 seconds.
The real potential for growth IMO lies both within Ripple's use of their blockchain technology as an outsourced payment processing network for enterprise/big business type clients as well as their large existing footprint in the Asian markets (a market I think is key to this emerging crypto scene becoming more globally viable)

The 2013 crash *should've'* been the great depression-style event of the 21st century, if it weren't for the ridiculous government intervention+non-stop printing of extra fiat cash that was done by the US/federal reserve, IMF etc. which has only prolonged the problems that caused it, they'll inevitably creep back up again.  When they do, and they will, the price on BTC and other crypto currencies will skyrocket if the adoption process is easy enough.  All it'll take is one solid bank run or a similar event like happened in Iceland in a major European nation or the US to happen, once, and the majority of today's consumers will lose faith in major banking institutions.  It's sad to say it, but with CC, we make out well from the instability of the current political situation and the economic problems from the policies of contemporary governments.

Ripple took my six figures in initial gains from being a very early BTC adopter and turned it into seven.  I love it :)

All the more reason for me to enjoy the inevitable gains in ETH, all the strain on the system in BTC as transactions process will only be exacerbated during a correction/bubble bursting event as panicked sellers overload the network and many attempt to move funds into alternative coins.  Plus, it's always nice to have an alternative.

Indeed.  I bought a boatload (several hundreds) of BTC when it first started getting minimal mainstream attention when whispers about the 'dark web' were still not yet getting lame tv shows made about them, so, idk, around 4-5 years ago?  Anyway it was super cheap, somewhere around 19 a coin.  I sold off a third of them when BTC hit around 2k USD and have held the rest since, I've made more profit on the other remaining 2/3rds of holdings in the past six weeks than any other time.  
I'm beginning to get a bit nervous because despite my early adoption, to be honest, I know very little about this stuff compared to many of you on here, I don't actively follow updates on it, and I feel stupid admitting this but I had forgotten about a shitload of coins I had sitting in a wallet for over a year and a half that I recovered thanks to a backup reminder of the information written down on a piece of paper.  The stuff recovered was worth so much now I feel nauseous thinking about the possibilities that I might've completely forgotten about it altogether forever.

...trolling people on 100+ day old meme threads now? Good for you.
