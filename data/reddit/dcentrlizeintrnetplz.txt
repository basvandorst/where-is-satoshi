Yeah I wouldn't trade any meaningful amount for Zimbabwe or Venezuelan currencies. And the only difference between their system and America's are... Hmm... That's actually hard to say, factually
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:24:27

@_date: 2014-08-22 00:20:32
THIS IS WHY WE NEED MAIDSAFE.NET!
@_date: 2014-05-27 22:17:06
They are making a p2p (bittorrent) internet.  
  
Think bittorrent, but built for all types of services like youtube, fb, Google search, etch etc.  
  
Every 1 and 0 sent on it is split up and encrypted,  
  
and then gets hosted &amp; distributed p2p like torrents.  
  
Check out their 5 min YouTube video explaining it. It's very well-maid :)
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:00:53
 Love this :)
@_date: 2014-04-15 20:05:48
Yay! Gave the 100th upvote!

Eventually the world will move into a Resource-Based Economy, like every other healthy system in nature.  
  
See YouTube's "Zeitgeist Movie" ( is the best)
@_date: 2014-04-14 00:11:12
I'm not against money, like Bitcoin is fine.  
  
I just don't like 'fiat' (BS) types like the Dollar, that are manipulated by bankers to keep people in debt and force them into jobs to survive.  
  
There's lots of great articles about this if you're interested
@_date: 2014-04-13 20:21:47
It's the answer that my lifelong frustration with our current monetary system has led me to.  
  
Give it a chance, I'm sure you hate stupid classes and menial, pointless careers as much as I do.  
  
This shit has got to go. We didn't evolve this far to fucking work at Starbucks.
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:19:15
Yeah u rite its hopeless
@_date: 2015-01-02 05:33:37
Have you seen MaidSafe / Project SAFE?  
  
That is basically this whole idea, just much more advanced and professional, and is being released this April.  
  
Check it out. Google it.
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:29:43
Really?? 
I cant withdrawal mine 
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:25:33
Yes me too. 
I sent 2 withdrawals and they both didn't work
@_date: 2015-05-17 23:50:42
MaidSafe is making a new decentralized p2p internet from scratch, will change every industry in the world very soon. 
It is backed by a brand new technology called SafeCoin, which is an eternally recycling economy whose value is based on PUT and GETs online.
Read about it!! 
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:25:10
I don't believe
@_date: 2016-01-08 09:42:59
OK everything works for me now. Login, withdrawal, etc. All good at BTCe once again happily :)
@_date: 2016-01-07 22:29:08
Yeah but did any of your withdrawals work? 
Mine didn't!!

Jeez took him long enough. He had been bashing and demeaning it for years
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:12:37
The only difference would be the number line axis at the bottom. Might be more like 40% on each side and standard deviation lines showing 3-10% is my guess. But the overall shape would most likely be exactly the same, statistically
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:11:54
Republicans tax the poor. Democrats tax the rich. You just choose which one you aren't, when you vote :P
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:20:52
Great go do it then
@_date: 2019-06-28 23:18:58
Yeah, show me any type of new investment class that can "compete" with what Bitcoin is, both as an investment and widespread brand.
@_date: 2015-08-25 03:45:17
Yeah. Escrow is safe. But don't be dumb and do anything foolish, cuz ppl will steal your money if you make a dumb move on there
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:50:54
Yes you probably are
@_date: 2016-02-18 07:00:19

@_date: 2015-09-13 17:05:05
Looks pretty bleak for you dude, sorry
@_date: 2015-09-26 01:37:37
This is only for the branch you were at, right? 
There's no mention of this on BoA's site, so I think it's only for the specific branch you were in
@_date: 2019-09-14 03:35:48
