Why do you think subreddits have moderators?
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:03:10
Google it. There is a wiki 
There is a wallet. A wallet can generate many addresses. You have 1 BTC in an address and 0.01 BTC in another - total 1.01 BTC. I give you my address and you use your wallet to send me 0.1 BTC address by paying 0.0001 fees. So now your wallet has a balance of 0.9099 BTC.
The transaction is included in a block and the person who mines the block gets the 0.0001 fees and your transaction is confirmed and I get 0.1 BTC.
An address has a private key. (You can't see it in blockchain.info wallet) If I have your private key, I control all the money in the address.
Blockchain wallet uses a words seed that is used to generate private keys of all addresses in the wallet. If I have your wallet seed I control all money in your wallet.
You just need your id and password to access wallet. If you lose password, you use seed to recover the wallet.

If criminals are a profession... I don't believe anything in the world is good only because it exists. The generalization is wrong, but traders indeed benefit investors, exchanges, businesses, etc.


I just mean if 4 traders buy a stock at $10 each and 1 buys the stock at $12, and the price is now $12, who lost the $8?


Value is finite, but can be increased (work) or decreased (burn down a building). 


Being finite does not mean being constant.


It is a positive sum game (for traders going long in stock exchanges), if you only consider inflation. It is a negative sum game, if you only consider taxes and fees. It is, for all practical purposes, never a zero sum game.


Value can be created and destroyed. Money can be created and destroyed.


I can do something good which I think is good for the other person but which actually is bad for the other person. An example, a kid saves a fish from 'drowning'.


They do. It is all relative. Life is never a zero sum game.


If you are rich or powerful or love you, they will do that.


If believing that makes one a good person, then that is what he should believe. There are people who suffer a lot and get nowhere and there are people who live luxuriously for no merit of their own. 
If life is a zero sum game, there is no need for religions to come up with heaven, hell, afterlife, multiple lives theories. We should be content.

I disagreed only with the reasoning the attacker will not able to profit from the exploit as said in the comment I replied to.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:49:27
1. You don't know if Bitcoin will double or half in value next week. If you think it will rise, HODL. Or you can spend and buy the same amount back. 
2. Yes, but more the price, more people know about it (news and media), and people are more likely to use and accept it.
3. You can use Bitcoin as a currency as long as people accept it.
4. A $1000 bill doesn't have any inherent value either. It is paper. If you want to buy a brand new cryptocurrency usually you can get in easier with Bitcoin or Ethereum (which you can buy using Bitcoin in almost any crypto exchange).
5. Yes.
6. True.

Not A, because Bitcoin is not backed with Dollars. Bitcoin is often priced with USD. Ex - Bitcoin is at $100k now.
Not B. Bitcoin is not backed with miners. Miners verify transactions in the blockchain and secures it. They are a necessary part of the Proof of Work Bitcoin infrastructure and gives value to the network. This, however, cannot be termed backing. The price of Bitcoin is not correlated to the price of miners.
Not C. Belief is not considered to be something that can back things. Strictly speaking. Everything has value only because it is believed to be of value.
D is the correct one. Bitcoin is not backed with anything. It is an independent unit of value. That, my friend, is what makes it beautiful.

Why do you think he still received less than 0.04 bitcoin? Sans his article, he would have received hundreds times that.

The attacking miner sends valid transactions. After spending Bitcoins, the miner removes the transaction by broadcasting his most worked chain without those transactions. The Bitcoins are available for spending again.

Bitcoin can survive a 51% attack. Though the price will be affected, it is not a matter of concern. The miner's blocks will simply be rejected by the nodes and other miners, and the blockchain will fork. The attacking miner will lose billions of dollars and Bitcoin will go ahead without that miner.

A lot of trading is automated. A lot of these bots set price points like 4000 as their take profit or stop loss points. When the price after crossing 4000 crashes to less than 4000, the stop losses (longs) and take profits (shorts) are triggered taking the price further down. Simultaneously margin positions are [liquidated]( further crashing the price.
This works both ways and is why cryptocurrencies are so volatile. Bots are set to buy on a bullish trend and sell on a bearish trend.

The security concerns are linked in comment by u/alineali and [here](
Then there are privacy concerns.  *Privacy implications are greater than the security implications.*  If you reuse addresses, the information matched with one address can be matched with all your addresses. A profile can be built with exchanges and services you use, where you get money, make money, spend the money etc.
Suppose a bad guy knows your email or number or identity and your bitcoin address, he finds that you recently deposited a lot of Bitcoin on an exchange, he can try to break into your account with whatever he has on you. He can target you with malware or call up the customer care and pretend it is you. Stuff like that.

For the sake of simplicity, assume the miner fills his block with his own transactions (it is easier to just mine an empty block). If he had filled the block with other transactions he would have got .25 btc fees over the block rewards. It cost 0.25 btc to mine his own transactions. He is effectively paying the same fees as any other user.
If it costs 0.25 btc to fill a block, it doesn't matter who does it. Anyone can do it. You are singling out the miner because you somehow don't think it costs them.

Exactly. The miner mines full blocks with everyone else's transactions so they get the transaction fees. If the miner includes his own transaction, he does so by replacing a transaction that has a fee attached. Technically, that is not spam because he is paying for it with less miner reward.


As you can see that the miner is paying for his transaction by choosing to not receive the fee of the replacement transaction, his transaction is treated as any other transaction. It means that the mempool is processed as it should be processed.
If the last transaction of the block with 1000 satoshis fee is replaced by the miner's own transaction with any fee, it is the same as the miner making a transaction of 1000 satoshis fee like any other user and it doesn't matter who mines the transaction.

@_date: 2019-02-16 18:17:16


Not really. The difficulty is adjusting upwards only because there are more miners in the network. For example, if Bitcoin price drops, the difficulty will also fall because theoretically it becomes unprofitable for some miners to continue operations and the puzzles become easier to solve.
Block halving is built into the network to slowly reduce the inflation to zero over a hundred years. There is no need for the block reward over fees to be permanent.
Consider that the first block rewards of 50 BTC were worth a few dollars. Now they get bigger rewards for solving bigger puzzles. If they get smaller fee for difficult puzzles, hash rate drops, difficulty drops and puzzles get easier.
tl;dr everything works itself out as long as Bitcoin has value.

Sometimes BTC fees on chain are high.
They believe their altcoin still needs to exist after failing years ago. Second layer solutions are not feasible on their altcoin and they cannot scale. They convince each other they have been right all along since transactions are cheaper because their network is less secure and  barely anyone is using it.

@_date: 2019-02-09 05:03:33
Don't spread misinformation. You don't even know why we need full nodes.
Nodes enforce rules.  They secure the network. It is not like they are just sitting there. Without nodes, there is no Bitcoin.


If enough full nodes decide on a new set of rules with a different consensus system, they can remove the PoW miners from the network. If one single node doesn't agree, nothing happens to the network. What is wrong with that?

Wrong. Marginal cost is the cost of producing one more unit of a good. That will be the electricity and maintenance cost which cannot be $7,000. It is the wrong approach to use.
If the cost is higher, the miner should turn off the miner. Why should he buy more Bitcoin?


It is obviously the other way round. As price rises, profit increases and there will be more miners. As price falls, profit decreases and some miners will turn off their miners or close down operations.

Crypto is unique. Other asset classes don't normally gain 1000% and lose 80% in a few months and enjoy this popularity. If there is a fork that changes the character of the coin, is that a taxable event? If someone is scammed, can he claim the losses if he cannot prove it because the website doesn't exist? If the coins he own is worthless and delisted, how does he claim the losses? If he bought coins in a now non existent exchange and he did not keep records, can he deduct the cost? Can he deduct the cost of purchasing ICO tokens when he sell the mainnet coins?
For volatile asset classes, they should make cashing out the taxable event.

Because of inflation.


You are talking about the Greatest Depression ever. What happens to all the debt? How do they pay it off?
@_date: 2019-09-29 17:09:51


We can agree that GDP does not account all that.






0% inflation is impossible to maintain. Purchasing power changes from a thousand reasons, from population changes to supply shortages.
It is better than high inflation or deflation. A low level of inflation still beats 0% inflation except when it is a fully developed perfect economy.

When money is hoarded, savings in the economy rise and both investments and consumption fall. Unemployment rates rise, productivity falls, businesses bankrupt, investors lose money, loans are defaulted....
Just think about yourself. In a deflationary economy, chances are you are going to be paid less next year than you are paid now. Can you pay the debts? Can you keep the job? Do you need to buy that iPhone today when you can it cheaper next month? Shouldn't you short the market?

I don't want to see the world burn or the entire financial system to collapse. There is quite a difference between disrupting a traditional industry and destroying an industry. I also don't want to see huge banks controlling and misusing money; money that rightfully belong to the people. If money is made democratic, if that really happens, there will not be another such crisis and the pains that go with it.
I care about myself and I want to make money. True. I also wish for a world where decisions are made by the people, for the people (not by democratically elected Trump), with transparency, accountability, privacy, freedom and no corruption.
We are indeed moving in the right direction. I see the blockchain revolution as a step in the right direction.
Banks and governments, unfortunately, only wishes to use the technology to make more money or control the people. Do not be mistaken, if they can break crypto, they will. And they sure are trying. The general disliking is not misplaced.

Bitcoiners are depressed to play PUBG in the bear market.

Can't they trace it? KYC, transparent, permanent blockchain transactions, centralized exchanges, IP addresses, emails... You don't get this kind of trail if they used cash
Hell awaits these fu\*\*ers

Since both X and Y is worth same in Z, no gain. =D




In that case majority in those jurisdictions will avoid paying taxes. After every bull run is over, a lot of us will owe more taxes than we own.
Tax laws should be citizen friendly.

You don't.

In r/btc, if you comment "BTC is good" you lose 100 karma an hour.

woah slow down.. what is dollar and what has a car company got to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:36:45


10 million satoshis!
@_date: 2019-05-11 10:03:48
I mean the loss is not 1 or 2k dollars, it is 0.34 BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-02 12:32:52
Meanwhile, figure out how this happened. Is your computer compromised? Have you lost anything else?
If I were you, I would completely reset my PC and change every password, use a password manager and enable 2FA. A hardware wallet is recommended for storing crypto.

When LN on SpedN?

Which address did you give? Is it for refund? Is the address the same as the deposit address you see when you login to Paxful?

* You deposit $10 with LN
* Merchant opens a Flexa account.
* You pay Felxa to Flexa.

Do you think sane rational people do this sh\*t?
If Mtgox, Bitfinex, Bitstamp and the banks get hacked every week, they sure as hell don't stand a chance.

When 1 Bitcoin is $1 million, the 1 or 2k becomes a loss of $344K.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:16:24


That is always the risky part.
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:22:23


Check it out. The transaction fees are less than a satoshi.


It is a Bcash sub.


Use LN for spending and buy BTC back after spending.

Bitfinex USD is trading at a discount. 1 Bitfinex USD is around $0.95 at the moment.

If you exchange currency X with currency Y without involving the domestic currency, where do you get the "profit" from?
Why not treat all cryptocurrency as a single currency?


Why capital gains anyway? Why not business income or something else?
