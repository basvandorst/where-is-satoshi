Hitchhikers guided to the galaxy was right, the planet earth is just a super computer running a million year universe wide program!

Yeah, creating another isn't going to help, it doesn't have following because stuff like this isn't using it. It's catch-22 until someone starts the ball rolling. If they can't use an established system then they're doing it wrong. Cramming data on the bitcoin blockchain is just going to cause even more congestion and problems and making more altcoins it's creating small fractures of the economy that's making it harder to hold stability and volume.

Just like they all got on the separate membership cards to track your purchases and 'rewards' of coupons, instead of the standard easier thing to just use phone number or your payment method they were using before, so they could sneak in monitoring family spending using one account but different payment cards.
Then now everyones got heir own App you have to download for membership instead of a standard barcode you could stick into ApplePay/AndroidPay/Wallet/SamsungPay as a scannable barcode in the giftcard/membership categories in the wallets.
So yeah, totally expecting them to jump aboard as legality gets sorted out as a temporary non-currency 'token system'. Cause face it, if swapping currency out for a token is legal (Arcades) how would dropping your cash or deposit onto Disney not work out, they support a cash-balance/card-backing already on the MagicBands, why not make it points so people don't have to worry about currency exchange and get disillusioned by the points looking smaller. Theme parks have $7 or a Soda with no refills, and I gag, but if they made you deposit like Chuck-E-Cheese or Dave-N-Buster $100 on load card for 50 points, and then the soda is only 3 points, you see smaller number and feel better about it, just like marketing has always been about 9.99 to make you round off that it's only $9 and not past your $10 double digit threshold.

So it's just another virtual-Visa debit card company, it just has additional few lines of code to trigger a bind of NFC to the OS! :P
I mean people have already broken down what gets signaled during a NFC transaction and the early tap cards were pretty much a prefix string and then the standard stripe data of the card number. New versions have a handshaked authorization token, but still, it's a known algorithm that just needs a contract with Visa/etc. to let API access for getting those tokens to validate at the POS.
Good news though despite the bitcoiners complaining about it not being real bitcoin transactions and/or still relying on centralization. The upside against that is that the buy orders go live when you use it, so that causes stabilization by having higher volume, which is a good side. As long as we don't get complacent to just accept only bitcoin-usd gateways like this, and just use it as a bridge before we go to direct bitcoin authorizations at nfc terminals with say, a patch, to the POS (but that won't happen anytime soon with the terminals being contracted through the credit card companies, they want their subsidy cut afterall).

Backups are not backups if they're not offsite, and if they were, the permissions system should be another user and not allow for modifying/erasing files that already exist, and only write the newest backup, then that gets it's owner changed away nightly, which would prevent the 'upload account' from tampering with it after that point, similar to an 'inbox' folder system.

You'd open up redflags if you tried to move that to a bank fast, and likely get tax/vat attention trying to send wire transfers or deposits.
Better off buying £1k - £10k at a time each week across a few exchanges, probably a few exchanges have limits something like that anyway. Also if you don't know how exchanges work, read up on limit orders and the bid/ask concept, don't just put 'buy X' in, cause that will quickly yoink the price up and buy a few really expensive coins unnecessarily.

The only reason they're 'free' is they make more money on the ad hits than they give you. For reference, generic ad companies pay something like 1c per view. The faucets give you something like 1/4th or 1/8th cent per claim per half hour or hour or day. You're still making someone else money, just on a pathetic scale that's not worth it for you.
They were amazing when it first started out, because not too many people were wanting to put money in and risk, while they were experimenting with what it was and how it worked. Who would want to deposit $100 just to see how it worked and risk sending the wrong amount (all of it) or not having anything to spend it on. Instead a few people took the risk by trading off ad hits for letting people get some little lint out of their pocket. This was still a useless amount back then, but the good part was the amount shifted with time to still stay connected to regular fiat currency like USD. So if a bitcoin was only $10 for 1.0, they'd pay you 0.001 bitcoin for the claim (Just the 1c for the ad hit). Forward to now, and they do the same thing but still giving you 1c worth. The only upside back then was early adopters before the bitcoin price climbed those 1c value are worth more because the value is 40x more expensive. So if you never did spend you have 40c per claim, etc.
Unless bitcoin climbs another factor higher... not going to make you anything, you're spending more money on electricity and internet and your daylight hours than you'll ever get.
That said, if you're new and just want to see how a transaction propagates through the network, it's a fine start. Get a wallet, get an address, go to faucet sites. They should only require a single field of an address to paste in. There's no way for them to scam you in that case. They either send you money or they don't. Some, since they're in such small amounts of payments, to save on the fee's eating 100% of that amount up or failing to send, they make you create a small account (just username/email and password) and then after you reach a certain number of payouts you can have it send to your wallet then. That's fine to just see money coming in and then try to send it back out to someone else to play with how to form a send, but don't expect 'free' anything at this point of bitcoins life cycle, it may still be skeptical by regular people, but I'm getting paid my weekly paychecks in bitcoin, and can just find someone to trade for what fiat I need to pay bills, and then rest stays comfy or I trade with people selling items for btc, it's already a fairly serious 'currency-commodity' as far as that goes.

The fee is written into the software, and takes a while before everyone upgrades to the newer version. You can technically send it with no fee or whatever you feel adequate. The miners/servers of your peers prioritize higher fees, then if there's space since each block is only a limited size, they'll include cheaper and cheaper ones until they get all transactions or lump the free ones in queue for the next block.
You can send for 0 fee, but it could take an hour or two to even show up, instead of showing up nearly instantly and getting a confirmation every 10 minutes from first sent. Just because it fills the field in doesn't mean it can't be changed. Some clients the field isn't editable but it's a setting in your options to change the included fee, and others you can just change the fee.

Well the limit is the number of coins generated, but at the same time it should still be a time limit +- a few hours. That's the whole point of difficulty shift, if we start solving 5m, 5m, 5m for every one in the period... then the next difficulty adjustment (I believe once a week?) will see that for the whole week it was solved twice as fast as it should, so the difficulty will double. if only 3 or 4 blocks out of the 100 were solved it'd go up 3%-4%. If it suddenly took 20m for a dozen blocks (a bunch of people stopped mining) then it'd cut difficulty down to compensate.
TL;DR They are coupled for the most part.

The better application would be to stuff a public key on the paper, and a sheet in the box with the private keys, then you can show to anyone with you when you 'share' and they can send you a buck or so. ;P

Whole bitcoins, yes. but we also have 8 more digits of fractional, so 21,000,000.00000000 = 2100000000000000 satoshis. Bitcoin is shown as a decimal number but even in the code it's a whole number like that sent over the network as a 64-bit integer. So you send 0.5BTC to someone the transaction is signed as 50000000!

MtGox has a 0.01 USD minimum field, the bitcoin field can be any amount but that's a minimum purchase, IDK, I guess to stop a billion smaller transactions choking up the network.
Virwox used to have 1btc minimum since they used it more like a stock trade platform, so it was BTC/USD instead of USD/BTC so instead of divisible down to pennies it was whole bitcoins, they changed in the last few months to having a minimum of 0.01btc now.
