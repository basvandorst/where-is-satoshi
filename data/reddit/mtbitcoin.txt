That would explain the recent dip in prices as the coins would have been converted to fiat :-)

Unconfirmed transactions show up in the mempool.  See

That was really a good talk. Enjoyed the video (On a side note though I don't think watching the Counterparty blockexplorer is boring,  I do it few times a day :-))

I really lolled.

Technically speaking, this is actually very doable. However, as with any unconfirmed transactions there is always the risk of double spends in addition to having the transaction invalidated by counterpartyd after it makes it to the block. 
As such I would say yes for "e-commerce" type of transactions and a "needs additional work" for retail POS type transactions

This is great new and I look forward to seeing this being the first listing of a billion dollar company (revenue)

Actually, there is a already a :
1. Place to have discussions for a specific token
2. Post business plans, asset introduction, updates and contacts
3. Decentralized asset "claim" through signature signing or broadcast for asset owner
4. View asset issuances history, dividend records and even a public listing of all asset holders.
5. And of most importantly zero fees, independently maintained and developed
All of these features are available via the counterparty blockexplorer at  . Just look up any asset information for ex: 
I think this should meet the basic communication needs for most asset owners without the additional resources and funding for setting up dedicated sites.

The dip from 6XX to 5XX. In a sideways moving market, all it takes is one big sell to drop it below its support.

Is the URL of the site  ?

This is really good. Thanks for sharing

For what its worth. The "END" results were actually similar to the "rebooted" Blockchain Vote that was held earlier. Going by the results at 
Olivier Janssens - 63 Yes Votes
Jim Harper - 59 Yes Votes
Michael Perklin - 37 Yes Votes
Bruce Fenton - 45 Yes
Which basically means both Olivier Janssens  and Jim Harper would have made the cut either way, with the first and second most number of votes. The irony :-)
ps: Congrats both Oliver and jim!

I've put together an Un-official Vote Scoreboard Tracker from the information I gathered from this reddit post regarding the Bitcoin Foundation 2015 Live Vote. This should allow us to track the votes in real-time transparently via the Bitcoin blockchain if anyone is interested....
