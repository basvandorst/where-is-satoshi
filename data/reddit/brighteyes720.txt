Did not answer my questions.
BCH is a better Bitcoin. XVG was a better bitcoin. DOGE is a better Bitcoin. XMR is a better Bitcoin (although it's more than just a simple fork. It actually adds good features.) Hell, Bitcoin Gold and Super Bitcoin are better Bitcoins.
There are hundreds of better Bitcoins. But Bitcoin has value because it is Bitcoin. 
If Bitcoin were to for some reason fail, why the fuck do you think a clone of Bitcoin would replace Bitcoin? Something wayyy better than Bitcoin would replace Bitcoin. (I would name some examples but I don't want to be accused of shilling. )
Your logic fails. Yes, you are bagholding LTC but just don't have these one-liner replies. Better not reply than mislead other people
@_date: 2018-01-18 14:22:56
What salt? I own lots of Litecoins (almost equal if not more in terms of USD value as I got ETH) but come on, you have to agree it's a joke these days.
Almost all commits being developed for Bitcoin are pasted to LTC (sometimes before Bitcoin's push so it feels LTC is being developed.) 
Litecoin really had no point because Bitcoin is infinitely divisible. It used to be called Bitcoin's silver. LTC will encounter the same scaling problems and will use the same scaling solutions as Bitcoin if it actually gets popular.
If cryptos are to exist, there will be store of value, Bitcoin and smart-contracts and other stuff's platform- which ETH seems like it will win that race. And maybe a good DAG coin. 
LTC is just valuable because it's the first altcoin, and is on all the exchanges so quick arbitrage with cheaper than Bitcoin fees. This is changing soon because of these feeless altcoins though. 
I am serious. These salt replies are annoying. Name one thing LTC can do which other cryptos and bitcoin clones can't. 2.5 minutes blocktime is not impressive. Low tx fees is not impressive.
I still hold LTC because LN will work with it (because it's a bitcoin clone) and so will Atomic swaps. I am holding because I know it still has a big pump left. But it's worthless.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:40:19
Yep. Bitcoin and Bitcoin*4 is amazing combination. 
Meanwhile ETH powers half of the cryptos in the top 100, has more amount sent (not even including tokens) than all other cryptos combined etc. But clearly Bitcoin with 2.5 minutes block-size and Scrypt algorithm instead of SHA-256 is clearly more valuable.

How is not supporting Bech32 addresses to SEND a choice.
It's a type of address. What you are saying is if I want to send someone Bitcoins but he has a bech32 address, I can't send him coins.
This actually happened. I keep a small amount in a core wallet for fun because I like a private node and saw a charity (Venezuela charity run by a redditor). I wanted to empty the wallet and decided will send the amount there. They use the Segwit bech32 addresses (starting with bc) and I couldn't send it. This is against functionality of Bitcoin.
Come on.

I used to work in a tech company and when somtimes we wanted to share or show something that involved just looking at it and not editing or anything we often shared phone pics on Slack. why? Because work PCs were restricted and phones have gotten way better so quality doesn't matter that much.

And that's why Satoshi will never be a unit. A bit will be.  Because most people in the Bitcoin community also get it wrong.
Because, a 100 Million Satoshis is 1 BTC, not a million.
However a million bits is a Bitcoin and a lot of major wallets and services already use bits. Bits and uBTC are the same. 1 mBTC = 1000 bits
Also the base unit of LN is 1 milli-satoshi, smaller than the smallest Bitcoin unit.
Simple way to remember everything
1 bit = 100 sats
1 Million bits = 1 Bitcoin
1000 bits = 1 mBTC
1000 mBTC = 1 Bitcoin

Also, from the FAQ of your website which was created before 2015 when this symbol was added




Actually, it has not failed! Look at it ₿ . Even your website says it prefers this but thinks it's not feasible to add it to the Unicode. But it has been added. Use this ₿  widely and it will be adopted much quicker to popular fonts.

This shows the maturity level of this sub
2 of these services have already said they are working on it.
Its not like Segwit is more secure or safer. Both are same in that respect.
Bitcoin Core GUI still does not support Segwit and doesn't support Bech32 addresses at all. Scream at them first.
And none of you have worked in a large company. Especially one that deals with money and finance. It's not a time sensitive issue. It will take a while. Patience.
I would give at least 2 months after Core GUI properly supports Segwit.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:48:53
Obviously block size has to be increased eventually. And it will.
Core is not against block size increase. It is against having a hard fork just for that and that only temporarily.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:48:32
What you should do:
Get a ledger/Trezor
Keep the 12 word seed and transfer like 10% of your holdings there.
Then use the passphrase feature and create and REMEMBER your passphrase and keep this as the 25th word and activate the feature
Transfer the remaining of your assets in your seed+passphrase account and maybe set a different pin for it.
You reveal the account with less money or show the original seed.
The theif will be alright with the 10% and you have the remaining coins same.
Can also be helpful during airport security and if for some reason they are smart enough and ask you to unlock it. You use the pin with less money.

It won't happen because new blocks will be relayed by the time and they have to mine on top of the newest block.
But assume it magically happens, they can just relay the entire block as a normal transaction which is what happens when mining
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:49:45
It's not 2M BTC. It's an exchange processing deposits and withdrawals and just a few thousand Bitcoins.
Eg. If you deposit 500 btc, send it back and resend it, it shows total recieved as 1,000 BTC. Don't get confused by that.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:37:39

Nothing really. It's just how cryptographic hashing algorithms are defined. It's still is a hashing function but just not a cryptographic hash based on it's definition.
This just proves it is not safe to use this function anymore. It should not be possible for any amount of computational power feasable on earth to find a collision. Once a collision is found, they are generally officially declared dead for cryptographic use. Of course, they are still safe to use for checksums and stuff but it's just security reasons.
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:02:02
I won't 'delete'. Can't say they won't get 'removed'. :)
@_date: 2017-02-23 20:36:55
That's even worse. That would be terribly terrible. It's not a cryptographic hash, then. 
The "non zero odds" are incredibly low odds. They are so low that they are uncomprehendable. I think there was an analogy (I am not sure how correct that is) but it says for a SHA-512 hash, if each and every person 7 billion people on the earth was trying to has 1,000,000,000 hashes a second and wants to find a collision between just any two of the hashes, it would take somewhere around 1 million years for them to have a 1% chance that there's a collision somewhere. But of course forget storing all these hashes and searching through them is a different task. Somewhere around 1,000,000,000,000 times of all the current computer memory existing in the world would be needed to store them.
The way this things work (like the one done by Google today) is not **just by chance**. It's **exploiting the algorithm** to make the process much more easier.
But of course, there's the non zero chance of it randomly happening. If it happens, just to be safe, we would probably declare the algorithm dead in spite of it being pretty safe. It has not happened before.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:50:15
In case anyone's curious or confused, this does not have to do with any Bitcoin flaw. It is to do with SHA1, a hashing algorithm, which for the first time has a collision been found. That means SHA1 is dead officially.
Bitcoin only acts as a reward for finding the collision. Bitcoin uses SHA-256, not SHA-1 to my knowledge which is much safer.

Ooh, a problem that happens if someone has 51% of the hash rate. That's not a god damn vulnerability. And if only 51% of miners are honest, this wouldn't work.

@_date: 2017-03-13 14:58:33
Nope. I'll sell pre fork all the coins and buy back if BU succeeds. I don't want to gamble this.
Just because I believe BU is the best solution but without consensus, it's useless. I am not a fool. I can support BU but it does not mean I can't see if it can fail.
In a perfect world, it would be a full consensus fork. Of course, the world is not perfect.

Uphold (formerly called something else) or coinapult? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:51:32
I don't. But MAX 3 tx/s (7 tx/s theoretically assuming 1 Input 1 Output) is too little and Segwit which is actually also pretty good for other reasons offer 5-7 tx/s.
BU will end the block size debate, reduce the fees (they are fucking high right now. It took 4 hours of a fee off 30 cents and one input two outputs) to have the first confirmation. 
BU will cause uncertainity but if say for example, core was the one behind BU, you all would be screaming it as he best thing to happen to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:01:23
See, people are saying it's China coin and all but you can say it any other way. If only the US mining pools want unlimited, I can say it's USCoin. 
The country where the mining pools are don't affect the working of Bitcoin. That's the point of Bitcoin. Also, mining pools are aggregator. Just because a pool is Chinese does not mean the miners are Chinese. 
Also, for BU fork to pass, a lot more than Chinese miners have to signal it. So, don't worry, it will never be a china only coin.

Rs stands for Rupees, the Indian currency. Cr is a short form of crore. India does not use the millions or billions system but rather uses Lakh-crore system. 1 Lakh = 100,000 (written as 1,00,000 in India) and 1 Crore=10,000,000(written as 1,00,00,000 in India),
Bengaluru is a place. The ghost santiation workers refer to a scam. There are no actual workers. So it is saying Rs. 934 crores were apparently paid to workers which don't exist.


Andhra refers to someone from the state Andhra Pradesh.
IAS is Indian Adminstrative Service. Quite an important job.
The rest is self explanatory. He only paid ~$10 for his wedding and returned to duty immediately.


Jio, now is just a new mobile carrier. You may have actually heard of it. It has tons of hype. India basically didn't have 4G at all at the start of 2016. Jio, owned by Ambani (India's richest man) started two months ago and has been offering free mobile sim cards with free phone calls and free 4G data till the end of the year as a 'Welcome offer'. It has grown quite popular.
They used illegaly a picture of the PM (Prime Minister) Modi in their ad and they just have to pay ₹500 fine for it. 
If you browse r/india from top of all time, you will understand most of the posts and it's actually fun to browse random country's subreddit.

Oh god, the movie is spreading so many misleading things. No, you don't go to a bank and scream I want to short. 
There are two main types of shorts you can currently do 
- Margin Short (Can be done on Bitfinex and lots of other exchanges. 3-5x leverage generally)
- Futures Short (BitMEX is the famous one. 100x leverage. However the world's biggest futures group CME is launching Bitcoin Futures next month if you're an American.)

According to the website, the bitcoin address is bc1q34p2wp0tv7gnstjjw6te2aezwqwwpgqexfwsx2. Isn't that an invalid address? 
Bitcoin addresses start with 1 or 3 afaik. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:28:14
I just want to be a part of this thread! Hello
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:14:23
So is this a new standard?! Is there any way to determine that it's a bitcoin address (presumably starts with b or bc?!) 
I was unaware of this. Can you point to an address on a blockchain explorer. I just looked at BIP173. Is it "live" or is it still a proposal? 
EDIT: Oh looked at the latest block and found a transaction that uses this system. 
Pretty cool but I wish the 1 was preserved at the beginning. This looks ugly tbh.

When did I say government should take over food production completely? Hell, they can subsidise food without taking over food production. We are talking about democratic socialism here. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:57:32
Sure. Basic subsidised  food for people who can't afford it is a good idea. Kinda like a ration.
@_date: 2017-11-19 11:26:28
I see this is the argument the most. English already has same words which means different things.
But context clears a lot of stuff.
I am assuming you are talking about the definition of bit which is a number which is either 1 or 0 (and not [a bit](
I don't think there is any confusion between the two. People in context of saying "Give me 300 bits" will not think "Give me 300 1s or 0s. "
Moreover, I think Satoshi is an okay unit. Mostly because of it's names. It's a person's name. New people wouldn't like it (hell, I have been around with Bitcoin for 5 years now and I dislike it). 
How would it sound if I said "I'll send you 30000 Johns." I get why it was named how it was named but it's not the best name. Also, bits is already **more popular** than satoshis. Many wallets and websites support bits and not satoshis.
Also, satoshis would require way more zeroes and I don't think the price of Bitcoin will reach anytime soon at that level that you find satoshis more convenient than Bits.
**AND THE MAJOR POINT**: Quick conversion of bits to bitcoins: 1 Million bits= 1 Bitcoin. Easy to remember if you use the million billion system which almost the entire world outside of India uses. And 1 BTC = 10^8 Satoshis. Not quick to convert. Weird too if you consider scientific systems and SI notations which are in powers of 10^3
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:06:29
But it's not honestly a good sounding name. It's a person's name. It does not even have any SI significance (It's 10 nBTC) while bits can already be called uBTC.
And as much as I like Satoshi and his creation, Satoshi is in the end just a person's name and sounds ugly. Using uBTC is still better than satoshi IMO.
But in the end, who am I to decide? I bet in the future, all units will be used and anyone can switch the unit depending on their personal preference.

Yes. And it is recommended. And both sets of addresses will always be valid so don't worry. It's just sending from newer addresses will incur you less fee.


Well, chain is the wrong word. Both belong to bitcoin chain only. They are just different formats of addresses.
And ya, with Ledger you can identify the addresses. The normal non-segwit addresses start with 1. And Segwit addresses will always start with 3.
Note: Non segwit multisig addresses can also start with 3 but that is irrelevant with ledger as it doesn't have multisig AFAIK (at least not for an average user. )
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:41:28
I have a question. How does spending from the output work?
In other words, if the address is just something random for human consumption, how does the guy who owns the private key of the address prove that this is his address unless BECH32 is in protocol level which it isn't. I don't understand that.
Say I own a Bech32 address and I got 1 BTC sent to it. Now, how do I prove that that is my address or anything 'cause how Bech32 is derived is not in the protocol.

I don't agree with most of the comments. Most are speculative. I don't think he chose the 21 million figure, it was a byproduct of other figures.
He chose the first block reward as 50 BTC. He chose the block time as 10 minutes. He chose the halving time as 4 years. With just this three, it's a decreasing geometric progression which converges to 21M BTC.
P.S: There can only be 20,999,999.99999998  BTC ever actually if you try to calculate based on the code. It becomes 0 satoshi reward before the total existing BTC ever reaches 21M.
EDIT: Corrected first reward, my mistake

GPS works via free satellites so you don't need internet.
As for the navigation, generally local maps are cached/downloaded and it follows the path their algorithm offline cause all the data it needs is on the phone.
However, you generally get better navigation when connected to the internet because of traffic statistics, road blocks etc.

Wat? You guys have 0 economic knowledge. Please read some economic or financial theories.
Also, you should know Bitcoin is much more popular now and people other than dumb libertarians like you use Bitcoin.
Honestly, I love cryptocurrencies but damn, some of you libertarians are dumb.
