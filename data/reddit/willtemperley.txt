I'd love to be in a position to boycott them, but my Visa card which, after waiting three months for it to arrive, was not on their records when I tried to activate it.  No reply from support and I don't want to think about how much the BTC I paid for this unutterably crap service would be worth now.  What a shit show of a company.

I love the disclaimer: "Transacting on BitMEX is not offered or available to any resident of (I) the United States of America, (ii) Cuba, Crimea and Sevastopol, Iran, Syria, North Korea, Sudan, or any other sanctioned jurisdiction, or (iii) any jurisdiction where the services offered by BitMEX are restricted."  Or in other words, the US or anywhere else that is essentially a dictatorship.

Bitcoin has yet to see a global recession. In the likely scenario we get one before 2020 and the big bankrolls really start hedging, I think 100k is realistic.

Why would worldwide adoption would be required to reach such a price?  Bitcoin could probably already serve the needs of the 1% of the world's population (&lt;80 million) which holds 99% of global wealth*. That's even without all the scaling solutions which are on the horizon.
Personally I hope it does scale before such prices are reached, so the 99% aren't priced out of the market.
Edit: misplaced decimal point

If they'd bought double the number of money printing machines using your and my capital, they'd have doubled their profit.  Just like if I'd had doubled the money to invest in bitcoin, I'd have doubled my profits. That's why they do it.  
I'm close to breaking even with a Genesis BTC mining contract after 3 months and it could continue for a long time. Yes I would have made more if I'd invested directly in BTC, but neither you nor I knew the price would rise like this.
My only wish is that I could choose the mining pool they use - Genesis are secretive about this.  I'd like to vote with my hash power.

Isn't it missing about half the story?  A transaction is not first represented as a block, it is signed and broadcast to the network, when it may be included within a block.

Tried to. They managed to send me a card after three months. On trying to activate it, they said they had no record of the card. So apart from being dishonest, they are gently caressing useless.

What the actual f? Bitcoin.com just changed his mind.
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:28:54
If you include the blocks from ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com which switched in the middle of the period, there's 71% support at the time of writing.
Edit: 80.5% !! I forgot to include BWPool who also just switched.  It's going to happen. Where do I bet?

hodl is hold with a typo.  HODL is a acronym,  the clue being the caps.  Although I suppose it's a backronym, given it was created for hodl.

Ah yes, I forgot, the bitcoin community: trolls, bad language and memes, preferably together.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:36:17
Bitcoin Unlimited (BCU) support down to 2.1%. BCU chain split tokens are up. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:02:16
I make BIP91 support at &gt; 80% of the past 144 blocks, if you include the blocks from ViaBTC, BWPool and Bitcoin.com which switched a few hours ago.

Cex.io take euro cards, maxed mine out back in April.  The price is usually higher there, however. Which is great if you're pulling half your bitcoin to fiat like I just did, because the community is Toxic right now.

As I also hold BTC, yes I know I would have made 200% by now, but that's not really the point. Neither you nor I knew it would do that.  It's a gamble as with most crypto, but a few scenarios are:
1. Perhaps make half your money back if BTC drops.
2. Break even after a year, make 100% profit after two if bitcoin stays level.
3. Break even after six months, keep profiting for the next 5 years if I'm lucky, profit could be very high.
None of those scenarios are too bad!  There is short term risk, after which there is a high chance of reward.  Also, if it was a scam, they would have increased their fees and upfront costs to reflect the increase in BTC, make it look profitable but make it not so. They've actually decreased their fees since I signed up.
Ether mining is fixed at two years, currently I'm making around 20% a month on that (i.e. break even at 5 months again).  Again, probably I'm looking at 100% gain after a year with low risk.
Mining is just one part of a modest but growing portfolio.  It's longer term and immune to all but the biggest swings in BTC.  My favourite bit is you have to do absolutely nothing except watch the balance rise.

You're right, the issue is not childish, but the level of debate is.  Have you seen Jihan Wu's tweets?  Core wearing UASF hats on their profile pics? I've spent far too much time recently reading about the debate and I have seen almost zero meaningful dialogue between the two tribes. I'm getting out to fiat, like Luke Jr suggested.
@_date: 2017-06-10 16:14:25
Check the stats and count the big players who support BIP148:
Also, note the difference between Segwit and UASF.
Can someone explain how BitFury signalled BIP148 without there being a way to do this?
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:43:09
That's what worries me, I think this may be smart money moving out, as the ridiculous and childish core vs miner face-off escalates

He's betting on the talent in Cryptos: from an earlier interview (May 5)  "I've never seen a small project with more human capital going into it, and I kind of want to bet just on that alone"

Level 1 is &lt;= $2,000 per day
Level 2 is &lt;= $25,000 per day
Level 3 is &gt; $25,000 per day
(I did 20 seconds of research)

Just withdrew some btc, the service was efficient as usual.

It's a scam? Really?  I just tripled my investment in Genesis bitcoin mining because I'd broken even after five months.  It all depends on the USD value of bitcoin - most of the "it's a scam" comments I've seen are by people who cashed out too early, not taking advantage of BTC rising in value.  I'm still mining the same amount of BTC per day as I was 4 months ago, because BTC value continues to rise in line with difficulty, meaning the ~30 cents per TH daily cost is more easily covered.  The only difference is the BTC is more valuable now.  Come back in six months and tell me about your investment then.
