working in I.T. I can tell you exactly how this shit went down
1. I.T. staff beg for the money to be able to upgrade
2. they are told "you can have half" (if they are lucky)
3. I.T. then puts together a half-decent plan to roll out the upgrade, but it will require downtime of maybe an hour
4. I.T. are told no downtime is acceptable. This effectively kills the plan.
5. In a last ditch attempt, I.T. put together a dossier showing the potential damage to the company if the plan is not enacted.
6. Management get a chip on their shoulder about being told they are wrong, and kill the whole plan.
7. Shit goes belly up. Management blames I.T. and tries to get people sacked.
8. I.T. use their documentation to prove that shitty management caused the issue by saying no
9. Manager isn't even given a talking to, but now hates I.T. even more.
10. this happens again next financial year

depends on your provider, but nothing criminal. At most they might threaten to cut off your service.

its part of the TOR setup for being a relay, so they can contact you in case something happens such as your relay being broken.
I just use a mailinator address, but in the config files on my Linux box it even says "you should probably use a new email address for this due to spam"

intelligence, or bitcoin use? Intelligence, no, sadly. I've met many a tech user who is a complete muppet. Bitcoin use, well yes. Jesus man, do you know how much tech you need to understand before you mine bitcoins?

I don't think bitcoin fanaticism has any correlation to intelligence at all. I've seen all manner of intelligent and stupid comments in this subreddit. You run the whole spectrum here.

you type 
ContactInfo YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS - YOUR BITCOIN ADDRESS
in exactly that format, only obviously substituting the things written in caps for the real values.

Vidalia for windows, although if you are on Linux it is much more compact and easy to run.
@_date: 2014-10-11 11:37:38
remove the space between contact and email.
@_date: 2014-10-09 05:31:08
You probably put a space in ContactInfo
