And it's been proven we cant trust a lot of companies involved in crypto

I heard about it when it first came out and was gona buy it for fun. Forgot for a few days and figured the novelty was gone so missed out

Some things never change

I think this is a little different then your checking or savings account and maybe would have been better explained in the form of stocks or how the price of gold or other goods works (on a seemingly useless rock). But good idea

Maybe youre here for the impoverished third world, I'm here because I like making money on a cool concept that in the future I will be able to basically say I made my fortune on made up internet money.
Also, you realize the very evil people you think you are fighting have bitcoin counterparts making fortunes here?
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:29:11
What's your deal? You wanna see bitcoin as a currency and not a way to make money? Long ways away from that pal

That isnt a real person. He is fake. Like fantasy bitcoin land where bitcoin never drops and in 10 years is the world's currency. So actually a great analogy.
Rest of us will wait for a good buy in point. This isnt unlike trading stocks.

Wait are you serious lol

A guy who doesnt realize you can make an alt account in less than a minute making comments about being new to reddit lol...
I literally have 12 accounts. Not counting ones I deleted. OP could do the same

She made 1k? That was worth skipping vacation?

It functions much like the stock market though

He was being sarcastic. It is tied to gold indirectly and by being backed by the US and the world
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:45:53
Unless youre a long term holder who is trying to make money and not spend it...
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:49:23
Shit advice. Set a goal and then sell. Holding leaves you with nothing

Starbucks accepts it now
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:05:19
That happened last time. Which is how so many people became bagholders. I think a lot of people have been scared right out of it. Just too volatile
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:43:13
I can't tell if this is sarcastic lol. His next question will be does anyone use a VPN for any legal reason and it would be completely valid.
But hey if you legally spend 5 bucks to buy a candy bar and trade that candy bar for cocaine, technically the 5 bucks was legally spent

Do keep in mind that theres a lot of investments people swear by and say all you need to do is put more than you can afford in it and hold for years.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:48:24
Wait, do most people here trade in small amounts?
@_date: 2019-05-14 00:03:35
Bagholders starting to sell off. Going to halt growth
