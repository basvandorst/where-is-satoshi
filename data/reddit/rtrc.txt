That's what I figured. It was a small transaction with a very small fee. Though I sent out a transaction about the same amount moments after to pay for something and that was confirmed no problem. Love your username btw!

This is absolutely bonkers. I got into bitcoin shortly after it peaked in the 1000s and the big MtGox scandal. I brought a couple ASICs (only a couple hundred dollars worth) and spent a summer mining shitty altcoins, waiting for the altcoins to have their peak before the devs quit on the coin, and then I'd sell for bitcoin. I figured it would be forever until bitcoin saw $1000 again and to think now its at $4000... Crazy stuff. Good on those who held!
And on a side note, I'm glad I never left any significant amount of btc in my online wallets. Every week I get a couple emails of people in Russia or Ukraine trying to log into my old accounts lol.

I'm really upset with how hard it is to use bitcoin as a payment. Everybody's up in arms about the price, yet they don't realize what a shitshow it is when trying to use it for its intended use.
Trying to buy a laptop. Went to Newegg and found what I wanted only to find out that their 'bitcoin accepted!' is through fucking bitpay and their bullshit payment protocol code, which my wallet (samourai) doesn't accept.
Thought about buying a gift card for amazon or newegg from Gyft or a similar site. All of which requires me to transfer my coins back to coinbase and then I have to authorize the site (with a daily limit worth hundreds of dollars of btc) to take the money from my account.
This not what bitcoin was meant to be. We have a lot of work to do.

Google Mt.Gox and you'll understand why its never a good idea to keep money on an exchange.

Msrp for the 1070 was $379. They're selling for almost 30% more than that. At any rate, this is the worst time to buy a card. Its been close to two years now since the 10x series was released and with their new chips doing well in their more advanced cards, its expected that we see that technology trickle down to consumer gaming cards sometime this summer/fall.
