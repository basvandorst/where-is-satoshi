yes the internet coverage is shite but when you have no stable currency, bitcoin is the next best option.


They are only inflationary unless demand exceeds supply then they are deflationary. The long term trend of bitcoin has been deflationary.


or $10 less.


They don't have to put a lot of money into it. Also you are just a pessimist. You should see what is happening in other countries like Argentina. The value of their savings declines by 30%+ every year.


Not really, we are just more open minded and educated than you are. If you actually did your research, you would know that virtual currencies and payment systems are expanding rapidly, both in the US and abroad. If you don't want to buy bitcoins then don't. Doesn't really bother me. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:17:00
Then you can't sell the coin. Rules are rules.
To easily solve the problem, use bitmit, not ebay. Ebay/paypal sucks.
@_date: 2013-06-08 03:38:07
They might, you never know but for now it doesn't seem likely. So we should be good with cash transactions for now.

Thanks, oh and can you bring the black hawks? It is so cool to see the men in black commando suits jump out of them and on to my roof.

Well it is cheaper to just put up a cell tower rather than run a cable to each and every household. It is estimated that 3 billion people have cell phones. The amount with internet connection is 1 billion.

I think they are treated same as a collectible coin and as long as the btc from the coin has been redeemed then it is okay.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:01:47
Okay everyone on the count of 3, we we will sell in combination!
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:16:44
Easier solution: don't use paypal.
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:26:42
yeah and they didn't mention any of the weaknesses with traditional fiat, for example that your assets could seized or a bank holiday will lock you out of your money etc. Then there is the risk of hyperinflation etc.
It isn't much of a problem in 1st world countries but in 3rd world countries, bitcoins is an absolute must have.
@_date: 2013-06-10 06:45:27
Hmm, hard to say. We first have to know what exactly they are doing to perform said state surveillance.
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:35:47
lol, yup.
@_date: 2013-06-09 06:48:45
lol serious, I'm seeing orders for 1000 + btc.
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:11:08
1% too many.
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:26:23
and no way to actually seize the bitcoin assets. Ouch.
@_date: 2013-06-09 07:57:42
Yes, I will right away.
I also sent you my social security number and drivers license just to make sure I am in compliance.
@_date: 2013-06-10 06:40:57
It depends on how you use the credit union.
For me personally, the transition from BOA to a credit union was excellent.
@_date: 2013-06-09 06:51:16
I'm trying to sell as much as possible so you can buy at lower price!!!
@_date: 2013-06-08 07:51:37
I agree, good points.
So the cash gets logged to you when you withdraw but the wildcard is in those hops. For example, you can further launder the money trail by spending a large denomination bill and getting smaller bills in exchange. You can also go to high volume places, like walmart/target and spend the cash there. Most likely your money will get passed to someone else.
Also use common sense, don't withdraw the money from an atm then go to some other automatic deposit machine to spend it. Those cash scanners have the potential to log numbers. Not to mention that all gas stations have 24/7 video cameras. 
Also you are right that probabilistic clues is all they need, it can all get pieced together when you combine it with all the other databases - cell phone gps coordinates, license plate numbers, security cameras etc. A pretty fast computer can mine all those millions of variables and connect the dots.
and now it makes perfect sense to be building a massive NSA datacenter in utah. One of the world's largest.

Any news is good news, considering how many people don't even know about bitcoin.
Especially considering that bitcoin is the defacto reserve currency of the internet!
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:35:35
They do, however, have cell phones. Not sure if they are up to smart phones though.
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:24:44


and bitcoin compliments such a system. During the hyperinflation events, many people resorted to using gold as money. Bitcoin could have easily been used in replace of that, in the areas where cell service is available.


okay, well there is nothing wrong with a deflationary currency especially when each unit can be subdivided into very small fractions. I would rather hold a deflationary currency rather than a inflationary one. Deflation benefits me as a saver and consumer.


USD has been banned in argentina. Not sure about the other major currencies but I am sure they will be too if they gain enough adoption. Argentina needs to replay its loans and the only way they can accomplish that goal is by debasing their currency. Their currency will only have value if they force their idiotic citizens to keep it and that's exactly what they are doing. Tyranny at its finest. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:28:15
I agree, this is indeed a very very very exciting idea.
I honestly can't believe it, i haven't been this excited about an idea since I read the bitcoin whitepaper!!
I'm seriously considering writing up a basic whitepaper to explain the fundamentals of it.
What should we call this new technology?
@_date: 2013-06-08 02:59:04
You are awsome
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:24:24
Yes exactly.
Kind of funny story. One day when I was younger I was watching the news and they were doing a story about how people were downloading music illegally using this software called Napster. I had never heard of it but it sounded interesting. They then went on to show how easy it was to do.
Right after that segment ended I went to my computer, turned it on and downloaded the program. 
Just think how many people are watching that segment and telling themselves, "Holy shit, you can buy drugs anonymously on the internet using bitcoins?? I gotta check this out." 
and that my friends is how we get more people to buy and use bitcoins lol. 
@_date: 2013-06-10 06:57:33
It is all about manipulating people. It is a well known fact that people react with greed and fear with all financial instruments. If the price drops rapidly, people get freaked out and will sell, "before they lose everything." If the price rises rapidly they use greed and want to buy before they are priced out. Just look at the recent boom and bust cycles with bitcoin. Everyone was displaying classic signs of greed and fear.
In order to successfully profit from this strategy you need to have a large amount of capital in either cash or bitcoins. 1.5m might do it, but I think you need to have at least 10 million. 
Basically all you need to do is dump a large amount of bitcoins all at once on to the market. This will rapidly push down prices. As others see what is going on they will panic and sell, further depressing prices. The original seller knows the price which they stopped selling so they will know immediately if fear has hit the markets or not. If the price continues to drop, their plan will have worked, as long as other buyers don't rush in to buy up before they do. 
To exit the position you simply buy back all your original bitcoins. 
and that my friend is how you make easy money manipulating the markets. Of course there are some major risks involved and you are not guaranteed to profit.
@_date: 2013-06-08 02:57:57
Makes a lot of sense but couldn't you simply just wipe the phone and reinstall it every now and then. Yes, it is a hassle but it should accomplish the same goal.
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:32:06
It will happen eventually. Bitcoin will gain ground in other countries. At the end of the day, everything is economic warfare. If some tiny nation adopts bitcoins as its reserve currency that might make their economy better. Why would they not want to do that? No country wants to use a currency that a foreign government issues. 
That's how it all starts then other countries adopt it to allow for more economic trade between the countries and before you know it, bitcoin will be the reserve currency of the world.
The sad fact is that the USA is already bankrupt and no longer competitive in the new global economy. Just look at the economic statistics for yourself. Highest trade deficit in the world, manufacturing sector in shambles, debt going through the roof etc. The writing is on the wall. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 05:25:42


Yes, that is an issue. I think the system will have to be a hybrid of centralized and decentralized. The voter registration and voter eligibility requirements could be set up by the government. Maybe issue a list of eligible voters and people will visit the site to register to vote. The government will simply determine who is eligible to vote and give them some sort of private key to use. 
This part needs to be transparent and heavily scrutinized to prevent disenfranchisement.
Once you have your private key, you then use a software that connects to a decentralized system that generates a ballot key for you.
Then we have another entirely separate decentralized system that tallies the votes. 
Each step in the process makes the system more secure to prevent false voting, double voting, and tampering by the government. Mind you, this is just the basic idea off the top of my head. I know there are flaws in the setup, the final system will be heavily scrutinized in how it is implemented but the basic idea is decentralized and centralized with multiple checks in place. Encourage the public to investigate to make sure their vote is counted, accurate and the entire system is balanced.


Yes that is true but that will only get you so far. Just imagine all the independent blogs and activist groups out there, they would love to jump on such a story and once that happens others may come forward. This will result in an investigation and then if true, let the public shaming  begin! 


Illegal would just be a discouragement, special interests will still attempt it but what I am saying is that as long as we have public watchdog groups they will want to know of any vote buying schemes. The more votes being purchased, the more likely someone is going to let the secret out.
@_date: 2013-06-08 08:25:23
and the free solar energy! No taxes being paid on that!
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:36:45
Yeah, I agree.
Most people aren't going to be interested in bitcoin because it is decentralized or has all these amazing qualities. They are going to get interested in it because you can do really cool stuff with it.
@_date: 2013-06-11 03:25:29


My guess is the media would have to shame them. We would need watchdog groups to see what is going on. We could also make it illegal to do such things. Make violators pay a fine or something?


Somehow make the algorithm not include specific identifying information? Maybe include city, state as an identifying signature instead of a full name, address etc. 
I'm just throwing ideas out.
@_date: 2013-06-12 00:31:05


No we don't have proof but that's not the point. The point is to protect all your bases before it is too late. Why would you want to take unnecessary risks when you don't have to? Your right to privacy is worth fighting for and these days if you don't fight for your rights then you don't have any rights.
Also taking these precautions will protect your data from hackers and other people who you don't want accessing your data.
Also don't give me that bullshit about you don't have anything to hide.
@_date: 2013-06-11 01:17:22
No I'm not going to stop saying that. The bottom line is that people are easily manipulated by emotions when it comes to money/assets. Bitcoin users are no different. What do you think pushed the price up to 200+ and then pounded it back into the ground? Greed and fear.
I was on this subreddit and watched it all happen. Like I said, there was classic signs of greed and fear in this subreddit.
@_date: 2013-06-08 02:56:14
It is if we let it. I say to protect your privacy as much as possible by doing face to face cash only transactions. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 08:18:31
$91 and dropping.....
@_date: 2013-06-08 08:17:51


Just one example: About 30 - 50 % of people are estimated to have extramarital affairs. Even if they buy flowers for their lovers, lingerie, wine, tickets for visit etc all in cash, I think that enough information would slip through to identify what they are doing. It just needs to be some cellphone location data, a photo with coordinates in it, or an incoming telephone call at the birthday of their lover.
Yup exactly. The more you think about it, the more mind boggling it gets lol.


Yup, add in facebook, twitter, instagram and all the other stuff out there and they pretty much know who you are to an exact science. Of course, as far as we know it is only for advertising but there is a huge moral hazard if that information gets into the wrong hands. Better to not have the database in the first place.
@_date: 2013-06-08 00:25:17
Great idea, I really like it.
What we really need is some technology that could encrypt the voice communication on the fly, send it to the receiver and then have their phone decrypt the communication. Just like with standard encryption. Anyone know if this can be done? or if the technology already exists? Seems like it can be done if you convert the voice signal into digital. What we need is a PGP for voice communication!

I agree, I was one of those who completely abandoned mtgox.
I'm not giving up my privacy for a little convenience.
