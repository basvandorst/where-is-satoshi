It only affects the mempool when coins are moved, if you keep your coins in cold storage it'll matter when you decide to move them.

He might be the most qualified at his job. He's taking steps to learn about it, so it sounds like he won't be a noob for long.

Started in march with the goal to reach 1btc before the end of the year. Passed it slightly thanks to selling some of the forked coins.

I feel the same way you do, but we can't be acting in panic mode. We have to incentivize switching to segwit addresses and exchanges. Blaming users is more likely to turn them off. Showing them the savings they will get both on a personal and collective level might prove more effective. That being said, I do agree that we need to move towards the solution asap.

Good set. Title is misleading as he doesn't mention Bitcoin.

Don't like the tone of this thread even though I get the intention is to free up the mempool.

I definitely identify with this picture. I've been living well under my means in order to invest every bit I could into bitcoin this year. It's easier to live under your means when you see your savings growing throughout the year. I am saving for the first time in my life. Very grateful for bitcoin.

I'm happy with my Trezor but Ledgers do seem to be a better choice for price and the amount of cryptos they support. I will probably recommend Ledger to my friends despite being satisfied with Trezor. Trezor does seem to be a good choice to claim forks of bitcoin thought. I don't know if Nano Ledger has the same features.

Sending bcc out of coinbase not working for me. They posted this message on their page : "Partially Degraded Service: Outgoing Bitcoin Cash transactions are currently not being sent. Our team is investigating."

This seems to have been fixed :

Reddit should make a remind me bot that is triggered by the price of btc. Or does that already exist?
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:09:26
Trezor has both bcash and bgold, I know nano has more alts though.

Having read it myself, and being a web developper who has studied in computer networks, I found it informative, thought not an easy read. It gets very technical, although I still recommend it if you don't mind taking your time to understand the specifics. You will come out with a greater understanding of Bitcoin.

You have an option in the Trezor interface to change the load screen. It's black/white at 128 x 64 pixels. I got my favorite image (mr robot logo from the show) and I reworked the image in the Gimp to fit the format and uploaded it through the web interface.

ShakePay is a new app that allows you to buy by sending them interac online payments. I tried it and I had no issues (other than interac transfers taking 2-4 hours).

Better not, I designed this Big Brother Poster in 2004. It was used as The Fifth Hope's visuals in NYC. It was designed for an adaptation of Orwell's 1984 in comic form.

In Canada you can buy with ShakePay. Move it to a wallet you control when you've made the exchange.

No, 'Éclair' is the name of the wallet, which runs on the Lightning Network.

New user here (since march), and am confirming that owning bitcoin has gotten more interested in learning about the technology behind it (currently reading Mastering Bitcoin) and planning on setting up a full node according to the Raspberry Pi demo that was posted on this sub.

Gold has kept the same value throughout the ages, but bitcoin keeps gaining in value since its launch. It took me a long time to realise this but earlier this year it hit me like a lightning bolt and I've been buying as much as I can since.

I don't know about stoning, but a friend of mine just visited Algiers and he was warned because he was kissing his girlfriend inside the appartment with the curtains opened. The host quickly closed the curtains and explained to them that no PDA is allowed.

I call bullshit. High TX costs were because the network was spammed. Look at the current costs now, and Lightning is now working, so NO, BTC will not 'topple soon'.

The ledger holds more crypto, but if you're just holding BTC or just a few alts, the Trezor just looks better. The user interface is nicer and the physical device displays the whole address when you send out coin. It's mostly a matter of preference. If you prefer to spend a little less, you might as well got for the ledger. A friend of mine has two and they work fine for him.

At the very bottom of the article you can see that they are asking for donations. They take credit cards but no bitcoin. Perhaps if they reevaluated their stance on crypto they might also benefit from it. Let's see how long it takes them to change their minds.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:45:42
Credit cards are great for buying things you may want to get reimbursed for. And for buying bitcoin.

I second this, I also live in Canada and started using ShakePay as an experiment at first, but quickly found I really enjoyed using this app. I find that the fees are less than Coinbase (comparing debit to credit, so it might vary in your case). Using interac to send is pretty sweet. I don't recomend selling through ShakePay though, as they give you $500 less than the current price. I sell using Bylls.com.
@_date: 2018-07-05 19:55:33
Oh yeah, I don't hold any BTC on there. I move it out as soon as I purchased what I need. I recommend a hardware wallet like Trezor or Nano Ledger S.
