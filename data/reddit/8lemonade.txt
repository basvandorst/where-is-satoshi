good question. the article is about a rising number of fake gold. i guess he wants to point out that this might be harder to do with bitcoin which makes it superior to gold.

It's completely Proof-of-Stake with an yearly interest rate of 1%. So there is a very low inflation rate and no mining needed, as every Wallet that is staking secures the network.

Nice thought experiment!
How about a second part on how to defend against this kind of attack?
What worries me the most is part 6(2). Can't really think of a way to not lose the longest chain if "outside money" brute forces the new chain to be the economic majority. In my opinion having more hashing power AND more financial resources could change the incentives away from the more secure chain...

you're right although there might be some price movement if this happens. don't think it'll stay like this, but might be used as a tool for the 2x part.

for now i'd say it indicates only that the market likes the segwit part
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:41:47
segwit will lock in within almost an hour and the new difficulty period starts tomorrow (
At the same time according to coin.dance the profitability to mine Bcash is nearing profit parity ( So possibly a lot of hash power could switch to mine Bcash as an attack on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:34:47
true. if it happens at all it would be more about a short-lived pump and dump and trying to demonstrate power to manipulate the market..

If it doesn't fit your use case (do you need censorship reisistance? immutability? scarcity?) why don't you use an altcoin that fits better?

Would I ever want to trade any bitcoin again after that deal? ��
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:36:59
good point. don't know if the influence would be big but eventually it's always self regulating towards the economic majority

I couldn't find out where to put in the command. Does anybody know how this is possible with mynode?
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:46:41
It's a disadvantage because anybody could find it.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:05:58
Can you explain the difference? My first thought was demand=demand although I understand your idea. You want to incentive mining directly not only through a higher price / demand. Have you asked miners already? How is this supposed to work?

How is the utility intrinsic? Isn't it utilized externally? Something or someone (being separate from the object) uses it which gives the utility value. It's given from outside.

will the iOS App leave beta phase as well when releasing copay 1.0?
@_date: 2018-04-29 04:37:26
That’s correct but these humans are separated from the things. Thus the value is given from outside and not intrinsic, right?

I've recommended this wallet to over 20 people. I'm not doing that anymore and left them exactly for this. Awesome they just did the node tethering. Would be great if they did something similar for custom fees!

A difficulty adjustment just before August 1 is bad for UASF right?
EDIT: So I guess there might be manipulation going on to not have a difficulty adjustment on e.g. August 2nd but instead add hashing power to have it end of July to make it harder for the UASF..

Disappointing that it isn't included in the next release already. Is it difficult to implement? If I knew how to do it I'd fork the project only for this basic feature. Would love to see the option as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 05:44:00
I've started using GreenAddress which has a lot of features and is a great wallet. But I'd love to go back to breadwallets simplicity in design with advanced options and have the feature rich apps only on desktop. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 20:35:51
looks like busy bees! wish there were more of them.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:15:33
I've switched from breadwallet to GreenAddress yesterday exactly for that reason. Now I can just check the mempool and set the Fee myself. Why aren't popular wallets like breadwallet and mycelium not offer it as an option?
