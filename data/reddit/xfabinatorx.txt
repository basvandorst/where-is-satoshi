Well.. maybe of ALL blocks.. Probably when bitcoin was very small there were a lot of empty blocks but this one is from today.

I am from Germany and actually a lot of my friends do know what bitcoin is (probably because I always talk about it) but nobody wants to invest in it or use it. Well, you cannot use it anywhere in real life where I live.. But still, Germany is a great land for investing in bitcoin because you do not have to pay taxes on your profits when you hold your coins for at least a year. :D

Well, ~~you can obviously exchange the coin for other crypto coins.~~(EDIT: no you can't, you have to pay taxes when exchanging for other currencies, at least if you use your profits to buy the new coins) But as long as you hold them for at least a year you do not have to pay taxes. That's why it's always good to keep every purchase on list. 
German site explaining it:
"Die Einstufung als Spekulationsobjekt führt steuerlich nämlich dazu, dass Veräußerungsgewinne nach einer Haltefrist von mindestens einem Jahr komplett steuerfrei sind."
