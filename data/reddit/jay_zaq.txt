you were able to profit by taking a risk, and now you have lost. Overall you prob still came out ahead

Simply dismissing views your don't agree with as trolling or FUD isn't the solution either... 
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:09:30
I'm not sure what the solution is, personally I'm of the opinion that discussing BIP101 won't cause any harm and shouldn't be considered an altcoin. I think bitcoin is whatever everyone agrees with, and disallowing people from even having the option to agree/disagree with it isn't right. That being said there are still a lot of circlejerkers who still need to be moderated on BOTH sides. 
@_date: 2015-12-01 21:12:40
I think we should implement in a way that is opt in for the receiver edit:in the context of RBF
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:35:59
I meant replace by fee haha
@_date: 2015-12-01 18:16:29
I definitely see the logic in sorting by controversial, but I don't think 'secretly'  changing the default order is the solution. There is a lot of anger over the scaling issue and it's causing a decline in the quality of the comments / submissions. That being said it goes both ways, the ban/censor button is not a disagree button either. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:40:33
Yes and no. It's like a  collection of keys BUT if you add more coins they might have different keys not on that "keychain" (wallet.dat) and you won't be able to access them with your old wallet.dat 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:07:38
the protocol will self adjust. The difficulty is based on total hash rate, when miners stop mining the hash rate drops and after enough blocks the difficulty will drop
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:21:20
Drop in the ocean maybe

My dad "Heard the Bitcoin bank got hacked hope you didn't lose too much" 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:32:50
One of them wouldn't go through even with 0 confirmations (unless you had it down to the second) when you sign and broadcast it the transaction gets sent "instantly" (the speed of the network) a double spend generally works by making blocks faster than everyone else (by causing a fork) 
@_date: 2014-03-06 07:46:46
it dosent have to confirm, you still couldn't spend these coins even if they wernt in any blocks, in fact that's the whole point of this post!
@_date: 2014-01-11 18:09:05
To be fair it's the largest exchange 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:14:59
Trading disabled.
@_date: 2014-01-09 20:10:37
You wouldn't and it doesn't matter. If they are double spending it will be very very obvious.

@_date: 2014-09-05 18:40:17
They both have something to lose by not signing, they both put up a bond in addition to the product and payment, the trick is getting the proportion right

You could just buy back your btc as you spend it? That way you're helping the economy and conserving your btc

Once it is not profitable the difficulty will drop

The whole country won't have all the hashing power, just people in the country, so it will be hard to fork, also even if they did the transaction could just be redone?

That's not how pools work at all, if two people were coerced everyone would just leave those pools

@_date: 2014-04-29 16:02:51
I see what you did there
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:13:39
possibly 3-6 hours you never know with BTC
@_date: 2014-06-20 21:52:49
They could already do that though, most big operations could 
@_date: 2014-03-05 22:35:32
3. No it wouldn't help the speed, having them as a well connected peer on the other hand would. 
4. Transaction fees are irreverent to a transaction going through, they go through "instantly" it would help it get included into the next block (but only of it wasn't going to get included which with a standard fee wouldn't be the case) 
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:48:20
Correct me if I am wrong but I don't think the math checks out, If I buy 1 BTC for $100 and the price rises to $800 and I buy something on overstock for $200 and then immediately buy $200 worth of BTC my net gain would be 0. (I would still have 1 BTC and would have spent $200USD)
@_date: 2014-03-16 16:51:37
Or 3-6 weeks honestly 
@_date: 2014-09-05 06:14:22
The seller puts up a bond too, if they don't sign everyone loses 
@_date: 2014-01-07 03:13:43
They should receive it instantly, it's not THAT unstable for the great majority of the time 
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:41:30
Well right after you buy it will go down, but if you wait it will go up. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 05:19:53
not even that right now
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:31:36
It happens every so many blocks, it's the same mechanism that has been keeping the difficulty going up right now 
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:57:25
Except that people can pay in bitcoin 
@_date: 2014-01-31 05:44:35

If you get good items designed a lot of people will buy into this 
@_date: 2015-01-28 18:12:20
Life has taught you? It's possible to calculate the odds of it happening you know. I'm on mobile but even if it made it 10000000000 there's still only a 1/10^40 chance of getting it. (on mobile so numbers are VERY rough I'm sure someone else can do the math) 
@_date: 2016-03-27 01:20:58
This has nothing to do with classic? It is barely related to BTC....
@_date: 2016-03-27 01:20:05
if you are an exchange you should not be speculating with peoples moneys, it is not hard to see how this could easily go wrong (see Mt.Gox) They should be making enough to function off of fees.
@_date: 2016-03-16 15:52:44
I like the noted emoticons 
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:03:04

If you have it on your website you could have people email you and then you send them an address to send the coins to
@_date: 2012-12-17 17:36:31
We aren't adjusting the rate though, the difficulty of each block is determined by the global hash rate, if we lowered the difficulty we would have to lower the hash rate  would keep the rate of blocks being found at the same 
@_date: 2012-12-16 06:02:20
I wonder how long till this is on r/circlejerk 
@_date: 2012-12-12 19:11:56
They will just have a higher priority, there's three things that factor into the priority, age of coins in wallet being used, transaction fee, and size of transaction. There's is not a limit on the number of transactions in block, there's is only a limit on the total size if the block (which is why smaller transactions have higher priority) 
@_date: 2016-09-12 01:09:13
As a soon to graduate computer engineer I would like to get in on this 
@_date: 2015-09-05 01:11:58
I understand technically it's part of ROI but the exchange price shouldn't factor into somebody buying one of these 
@_date: 2015-09-05 15:57:01
Because if the price going up is whats making you money you are better off just having spent the money on coins in the first place. I guess if it goes down? 
@_date: 2016-10-03 17:27:24
Well if somebody asks for an ELI5 I feel like you should try to give them both sides, obviously it's ok to have a preference but

Mods define 'brigade'  as a bunch of people down voting something they strongly disagree with, only things they agree with deserve to be voted up 
@_date: 2015-11-29 03:04:37
 I disagree was the wrong choice of words, your comment was actually on point. As a side note linking to tweets with articles is annoying 
@_date: 2016-10-03 16:17:47
Does that really seem like an unbiased viewpoint to you? 
@_date: 2015-09-28 01:29:34
so one person could have a predator drone AND 260 mil? sounds like a lot to me...

I would disagree, why not just link to the article? 
@_date: 2015-11-28 00:30:05
I'm not sure I understand your math, if you break even in 6 months then you will start making money? I know the fallacy of relying on rising price if that's what you are referencing 
@_date: 2015-10-14 16:47:22
Shared coin is down too 
@_date: 2016-05-25 00:32:24
You should be able to find that value easily with the rough amount sold. I'm interested to know the answer 
@_date: 2015-11-27 22:45:51
I'm not saying it's a worthwhile investment but 4-6 months to break even is considered pretty good in the real world.... 
@_date: 2015-10-14 02:21:41
I fear this will increase the blatant censorship of this subreddit, hoping to be proven wrong. 
@_date: 2015-10-08 22:45:53
It's not really the same price though since it will use a lot more power right? 
@_date: 2015-11-28 03:25:00
If it takes years to get the same amount then you aren't breaking even in months, that's what breaking even means man. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:33:10
I agree I don't think censoring those ideas are a good idea, and I think enough people agree that the mods should reconsider their stance 
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:20:21
If they use it widely and it has a fixed supply then it will be worth a lot 
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:38:26
Oh I've never gotten a tip on reddit! 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:13:06
So if Bitcoin had a big enough market it would be 'safe' just like gold 
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:52:06
This thread makes me happy 
@_date: 2013-03-01 15:27:36
Regardless it IS POSSIBLE  and the odds grow every time a new address is used 
@_date: 2013-01-02 20:37:39
Yeah you would have to make a ton of addresses and that would just make the risk larger 
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:20:25
In the protocol? No, there's been talk of 'banning' certain coins but we don't really want anybody to have that kind of power, it was a big deal right before the skyrocketing price actually. I believe it was called something like COINvalidation or something like that
@_date: 2013-04-29 02:41:21
The reason was so other people could see oh look people are giving money out that's cool 
@_date: 2013-04-08 07:27:43
There are way more than  7 transactions a minute, txs are very small 
@_date: 2013-09-19 15:26:45
That sounds a bit like the concept of green addresses 
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:09:32
I used to think that BUT going far below your limits and getting one with cash back or other benefits is basically free money so you should look into that 
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:10:36
The transaction is essentially instantaneous, it's waiting for confirmations that takes time. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:33:06
Why would the price crash just because they put out a bunch? 
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:50:32
what's your source on that second edit?
@_date: 2013-03-01 14:46:43
Everyone is saying they are lost forever but that is not technically true, when you generate a new address there is a very very very very small chance of generating an address with bitcoins already in it 
@_date: 2013-03-01 19:23:31
This is what I was trying to convey, it would be pretty much impossible to take an address and them randomly get a collision with that address, but the chances of any two random address colliding is much higher 
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:13:24
But it only takes 23 to get a 50% chance 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:00:36
Honestly that wasn't as bad, they rolled back the changes and actually functioned as a competent exchange, now it's clear that whoever is running it just wasn't ready for that kind of popularity and isn't up the task 
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:49:42
it's the right date and amount
@_date: 2013-03-03 17:16:39
It's still on the front page I don't think we really needed this post about it 
@_date: 2013-04-04 17:00:37
They don't need the consent because they are directing the miners, but yes if a miner left they they would lose the hash power 
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:42:17
23 is for the birthday problem the number for bitcoin address will of course be MUCH larger 
@_date: 2013-03-19 23:38:49
Wouldn't work, it would sell right away as its the cheapest immediately 
@_date: 2013-11-07 02:33:48
Because somebody put up a million dollar wall
@_date: 2013-02-16 05:09:04
Is there a time limit on this? How would not ever lose this bet

Yeah because one of chinas biggest fears is coming off as heavy handed... 
@_date: 2013-01-02 17:49:36
When I generate one of these offline how do I know somebody else didn't make the same one? What if it makes a private key for an already existing account? 
@_date: 2013-03-07 06:50:33
Or even more likely $51
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:49:32
Another thing I'm not sure about is how profitable this would be? Risking blocks like that without the majority could end up losing money, and if you had the majority there are better attacks to do anyway
@_date: 2013-03-01 16:01:31
Sorry I was thinking of  where the chances of two matching goes up faster than linearly 
@_date: 2013-12-02 18:18:00
You can have your cake and eat it too, buy Bitcoin and when it comes time to spend them just immediately buy after you spend them, you'll have spent them while still holding onto the same value of coin 
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:26:40
it depends on how much mining power the selfish miner group has, but yeah thats a risk
@_date: 2013-04-13 17:10:52
Maybe it's because I'm on my phone but I really don't understand what you're saying. If I our my whole balance in a pair wallet and then import the private key to say blockchain and send money around then some of it will go missing? 
@_date: 2013-05-18 16:42:05
You don't need 6 confirmations though 
@_date: 2013-02-25 19:23:13
A 51% is not the most likely way they would take it down IMO. It's more likely they'll slowly buy up bitcoins and then sell them all at to crash the market, then they could buy some of the new crashed bitcoins and crash it again and again until people didn't trust it anymore 
@_date: 2013-03-01 15:45:03
You don't have to blow through the whole list though, it's like the chances if people having the same birthday, ALSO  the way we generate addresses is far from random so that has to be taken into account too 
@_date: 2013-10-23 22:51:49
There is more people buying then selling (more demand than supply) on gox because nobody wants to sell on gox because it is very hard to get USD (maybe all currencies? idk) out of gox

@_date: 2013-03-26 04:43:02

SO glad I bought this morning
@_date: 2013-10-20 18:37:30
If all the miners drop out the difficulty would go down and mining would be easier 
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:56:18
Yeah that would suck to have accepted &gt;$2000
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:29:16


Is that how the protocol works? Since the blocks are legitimate why wouldnt the honest miners start mining the selfish miners fork, since its longer?
@_date: 2013-12-07 18:46:27
How to not lose money: don't sell lower than you bought. That's literally all there is to it 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:55:05
It doesn't matter if you think the price is going up in regards to the question of spending it, you could simply buy some when you needed to use it

@_date: 2013-01-02 18:21:25
It isn't quite the same thing, your chances of getting the same as a specific address is 1/2^160, but your chances of getting the same as an existing address is (# of existing addresses / 2^160) which might not be a problem now but wont it be in the future if a ton more addresses are generated?
@_date: 2013-03-15 01:12:01
Does the MFLB come with a grinder already even if you dont get it as extra?
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:22:22
It's not like saying that though. When you send BTC they "receive" it immediately, when you swipe your card they won't actually see the money in their accounts for a while 
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:40:39
It only keeps it secret if no other blocks have been found, if it has one  in secret and the honest miners send a block, they have to publish the one they have to immediately publish it, leading to what the paper calls a "toss up"
@_date: 2013-03-08 06:01:00
1.1MB/s doesn't sound that bad, but 1. Some people don't even get that speed (I have AT+T and I get 350kb/s) and 2. People don't want to be using that much all the time, it's fine if your not doing anything else but trying to stream netflix, update steam and now your throwing the bitchain in too? Gets a little much 
@_date: 2013-12-29 02:56:45
Keep the private keys, if they don't redeem after a while sweep them back
