china has  been trying to shut it down since 2013 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:07:23
It needed to happen but I prefer  it not 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:40:31
all these exchanges are bad. frozen balances, poor security, withdraws broken, funds not depositing, no customer service  
their logo is a hair comb

As if he has anyway of knowing. These analysts are useless. There are no consequences for being wrong, but he gets to reap the spoils if he's right, which I'm sure he won't be. $100k is a a really , really long ways away 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:52:23
in 2008 wall st. failed.
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:54:42

@_date: 2018-01-23 01:51:30
this is bs. all the news has been good. segwit, LN, Korea...we should be at 14k at least.
@_date: 2018-01-18 16:31:52
I wonder when the decision will be made about legality 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:20:42
100% in a year is doable.

But he has no way of knowing what bitcoin will do. he's basing this on a hunch and the the hope 2018 will be the same as 2017 , and not on any sort of logic . This guy is paid tons of money to pull numbers out of his butt to make his clients who own Bitcoin happy. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:17:59
yeah . scummy fuckers 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:37:49
bitcoin always does this. it will come back eventually 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:38:56
what a shill ..name checks out 
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:13:30
it is already Friday in Korea
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:35:10
still no decision rendered about Korea bitcoin ban. if the news is good it may go back to 14000
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:15:21
lol more like .001 bitcoin on an old laptop 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:43:35
fake news times
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:47:39
If Korea govt. rules in favor of no ban, we could pop 20% or more 
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:33:42
still no decision rendered about Korea bitcoin ban. if the news is good it may go back to 14000
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:40:05
no because there is no way to implement it 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:52:42
 Fibonacci levels are meaningless/useless
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:55:54
dont use coinbase
@_date: 2018-01-19 01:53:52
Hope soon we get the final word on the S. Korea exchange ban
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:06:31
wolf of wall st 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:23:53
that is shitbase for you. they are always working on it when others actually do it 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:25:55
your first mistake was using coinbutt. cancel the account and open one on a real exchange instead. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:41:17
dropping like a stone now. will keep falling probab;y until we get word on Korea situation 
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:45:45
still no decision over Korea. I think w'll have to wait till next week
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:21:10

@_date: 2018-01-21 18:22:46
given that is is cuntbase  it will take longer than everyone else, and there will be no updates, and the they will probably inside trade on it 
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:41:59
boring market
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:40:46
it is not settled yet. I think decision will be rendered tonight or tomorrow 
@_date: 2018-01-23 01:54:19
Um spert. did you ever hear of capital gains tax. all it is is a tax, like the US and other countries have.

@_date: 2018-01-21 21:45:12

@_date: 2018-01-21 18:24:47
