Hey Jimmy,
I study behavioural science and I completely understand the whole more payment options = less donations.
The reason why is because people are overwhelmed with questions of how to donate.
The best way to ask people questions is by giving them only one question at a time, and for each question having 2 - 3 options.
If you look at this page:
There are three questions. The second question (how much to pay) has 8 different options, one of which is open ended (Other).
So, lets say I have a credit card, but I also have a Paypal account. How should I donate?
I know it sounds silly, but simply by giving two options, both which apply, people are less likely to click either button.
Here's how to fix it:
1. Ask one question at a time. In this case, ask One Time or Monthly. With a "Next" button. After "Next" is clicked, it should seem like the person has made the decision and shouldn't need to go back and change it again.
2. Next question: Since the amount is more or less open ended, simply have a text box with a default amount (like $25), and allow the user to change this amount. That's it. No other options. Just "Next" button.
3. Okay, now that the person has already chosen what he/she wants to pay, choosing *how* to pay should be built to be the least difficult. Here is how I would do it:
"How would you like to donate?" * Credit Card.  * Alternative Method of payment.
If they choose "Credit Card":
"How would you like to donate with your credit card?"
* Use it directly.  * Use the credit card through a third party website.
If they choose to use a third party website, give selections of paypal or amazon or whatever else.
This way people don't get weirded out choosing between paying direct vs paying with paypal if they have the ability to do both. By choosing an option earlier to pay directly, you take the possibility of using paypal out of the picture.
If they choose not to use a Credit Card, you can further expand the questions, but just make sure to always cut it down to only 2-3 possible simple options that do not conflict with each other.

1. As a limited currency, Bitcoin will most of the time keep increasing in value.
2. It is built to be traded easily between two people.
Those two reasons alone will get more people to use Bitcoin.
More use will get more merchants to accept it as payment.

Look at the top graph right now:
Notice the gap between 18.40 and 18.80? That means its very easy for the price to vary between.
Generally this information is good to figure out how you will affect the market if you are buying or selling a bit amount.
Also, it is interesting to analyse how the buying amount and selling amount changes during bubbles. Not all people who want to sell, sell right away. They choose to sit and wait.. this is a good way to observe their stance.

Thanks stormsbrewing.

Even if it is not concentrated, if something goes terribly wrong (ie, the government bans bitcoin), the price of bitcoin will go down regardless if it is owned many by few people or not.
It is not difficult to affect the price of Bitcoin. All you need is about $30,000 or so to make it go up or down. $30,000 is NOTHING for millionaires.
If the market was truly owned mainly by millionaires, Buying $30,000 would not make a dent in the Bitcoin price.
If you assume that the millionaires are holding on to their money and not exchanging it (thus not affecting the market price as I noted above), then the price wouldn't be going up because of them.

@_date: 2013-02-17 23:55:57
Based on [my review of BitPay]( the main feature I kept lacking is easy way to have get currency conversion. Not even a cheap javascript version. That is what I am providing.
As for providing false data, we are not expecting the server to use the conversion rate provided by the client. Currently when using BitPay, you specify how much to pay in USD and BitPay does the conversion for you. Even if a user modifies the client code for bitcoin amount, the server will still send over the USD amount to BitPay, which will then be converted on BitPay's side.

The problem with paypal is that he can later do a chargeback once he receives the bitcoins from you.
The way around this is to:
1. Get the money from him through paypal.
2. Once it is in your paypal account, send the money from paypal to your bank account.
Only once it is in your bank account do you send him bitcoins.
I know it takes much more time, but this is the only real way through paypal. That is why businesses who use paypal take so much time before allowing you to collect payment.
2 hours is a much shorter period of time.

And the idea is that everyone else investing may actually overwhelm the early bitcoin millionaire.
21 Million bitcoins total. Let's say this guy owns 10 Million bitcoins and sells them all at the same time.
Will the price go down? Yeah.
Will that person's Bitcoins redistribute to everyone else because it was all sold to everyone else? Yeah.

A year ago I bought some silver and gold.
If you have the expectation to make money later, it's not easy to just buy it.
There are many different types of silver. Most small amounts (1 oz or less) are branded with some custom design that few people know about, which will be difficult to sell later.
If you buy it off the street, it can easily be lead painted with silver on top.
Selling silver is not easy. Current spot price is about $30 per ounce.
On Amazon, people have 10 ounce bars listed for $400+ because Amazon takes about $60 for itself in fees.
When dealing with precious metals, unless you go to some pawn shop which will buy it from you for an extremely low price, you'd be better off making money by selling it directly to customers.
Customers get a bit picky when it comes to buying an investment. You have to package it up nicely and send it quickly.
You avoid all of this extra work with Bitcoins.

I keep seeing people say "..not better than Bitcoin" and "51% attack" ..this is based on a biased wiki against Litecoin....
There seems to be conflict of interest against Litecoin.
Litecoin is almost exactly the same as Bitcoin, just less well known. A good number of people mine Litecoins instead of Bitcoins, then trade for Bitcoins because they get a better profit.
If Litecoin were to get more media attention, you would see it would be no worse than Bitcoin.
In any case, Litecoin has only been around for a few months. Bitcoin has been around for ~4 years. Given the current rate at which people are starting to use Litecoin its much faster than when Bitcoin was just starting out.

If you hoard Bitcoin, but don't use it, you don't matter in terms of the market price because you don't affect the [Velocity of Money](
If many people hoard Bitcoin enough that the Velocity of Money is consistently effected simply by people buying up, then it is decentralized enough that a few wealthy individuals cannot affect the price as much.
Unless of course you assume that most of the purchases are made by a few wealthy individuals. But then I don't really consider that a ponzi scheme any more. Simple wealthy individuals slowly investing in Bitcoin..

My own. I wrote it.
I run the site [Custom-Stores]( which allows you to open a store like this.

Yes. You don't even need to be online to receive money.

How do people know how to order your product with their bitcoins?
Do you put your address under the "bitcoin accepted" message?
 Do they contact you?

Same thing happened to me! I guess everyone is in the same boat now.

Thank you maxminski!
I'm a behavioural science hobbyist and this is amusing to me. :P

I remember, regarding the Israeli kindergarten in Freakonomics charging late fees for the children.
Parents chose to pay rather than come on time.
I was talking with a friend about it..
They should have further experimented to see how long the parents would continue to pay, with increase of pay for coming late. :)

I see you writing this more than once... I can get paid a lot for "producing" very little.

Ok, we did it. On the front page of the 'Top Ideas' list.

Why not just un-upvote the bot?

Exact time it starts, anyone?

Nice of you to get permission and show sources.
People don't do that now-a-days. :P
In fact in our internet age, people feel pretty good about their artwork appearing in many places, without consent.
Interesting future we have.

I've been trying to do "research" on Bond and Stock data.
Did you know buying and selling randomly will give you a better return than most financial advisories?
Wikipedia is built by random strangers.

Amazon also sells books and on Amazon I can list my own products.
There is no comparison.

Once it's in the bank, you can withdraw the money. The bank can't run you a negative balance due to a recent law passed unless you opt in.

I couldn't find it: There's an xkcd comic of a person cursing off someone on the web, then magically flying over to talk in person. The two quickly settle their problems, and the person flies back.

I have.. a little more than $32K waiting.
I've never dealt with lawyers before.
Do you know how to get *real* legal advice for free?
Roman, you have been quite responsive before. Even if the money is not yet available, at least provide an update.

Amusing how you can change the description but not the title..
Good old Reddit.
