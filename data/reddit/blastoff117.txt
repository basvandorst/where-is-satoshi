Hey everybody, longtime enthusiast and investor here. Over the last two years or so, my interests moved away from bitcoin and crypto plus I had to focus on finishing school and actually becoming employed, but now that I am employed I would like to dive back in and was wondering how to get up-to-speed on any and all of the latest developments. 
Interestingly enough, my employer is now looking to me as the “bitcoin guy” and I’d like to be as much of a resource as possible. I used to listen to LTB and basically all of the podcasts back in the day, but now I’m a bit adrift. Any direction is welcome!
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:53:54
Same. Except with my gf. Every time I mention how I just can’t afford a trip or something, I have to preface it with “Well, I can afford it, just not now” haha

Speaking of a lack of network propagation, am I the only one that experiences regularly unconfirmed transactions on Coinbase? I only buy btc in small increments so when I'm trying to send anywhere from $1 - $10, I'll typically have my transactions just go unconfirmed for 24 hours. It's pretty irritating.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:32:51
I was just experiencing the same thing. I wonder if you get a coupon *after* you make the make the purchase. The email reads "and receive 25% off your next purchase."
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:27:36
It's really awesome that there seems to be more and more tea vendors coming out of the woodwork to accept Bitcoin. It's like the perfect marriage of two of my favorite things. I'll see if I can make a purchase soon.
@_date: 2014-04-21 03:11:55
Saw it as well! I feel that guy that said it might have more bitcoin mentions later. Just seems like the right kind of character for it

Do you really have to be rude about it? I got excited and posted before searching. I do apologize.

HashRack, because I'm an idiot. BitInvader, a scammer website that showed up during Black Friday, was selling video games and consoles and I fell for their deals. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 12:13:29
Honestly, it's not unusual for btc transactions to take up to an hour or more for complete confirmation. I've had transactions take more than hour before and I've had some transfer in +/- 30 mins. You could PM me your address or the transaction hash just so I can look over the transaction. 
Another thing..if you desire faster confirmations, try increasing the fee to really anything above 0.0001. That almost always allows faster network propagation.
@_date: 2014-07-20 04:47:32
Amen, brother.

Awesome idea! Now, here me out on this, what if Bitcoin users at Universities could create some kind of network through which we could coordinate and evangelize Bitcoin together? I attend the University of MS (as a Senior as well) and while I've found some people that have heard of Bitcoin or know someone who owns some, there hasn't been much capability to connect with these people. As far as creating a student organization goes, I'm of course not very familiar with the process at my own university and it is something I should definitely look into, but my issue more than anything is having the channels open for discussion. And judging from the university website, the "How To" section on Student Orgs is still "Coming Soon". 
To give an idea of the situation here in MS, there is only one business I know of that accepts Btc and it is 3 hours from me in Starkville, MS. The only one.

I actually sent my local station like 0.12 ($10 or so at the time) in an email during their Fall Drive Time and someone must have claimed it because I never got it back after 30 days. Not unless Coinbase didn't implement that feature till after September.

Bought my ticket last night! I've been saving up BTC for a year for a chance like this. Btw, does TNABC send you any confirmation that your ticket was purchased? I have the BitPay receipt, but no real proof of the ticket itself.

I know we don't like to draw attention to the money laundering capabilities of Bitcoin, but just for the sake of this post..I'd say House of Cards Season 2. Why funnel money through Native American Casinos when you could just "coin mix" all of your btc for nefarious deeds? Assuming that even the super PACs accept btc and everyone is using TOR.

A fairly acceptable list I must say. Don't know if CoinDesk actually deserves to be in the top five, but the others make sense. The fact there is a list at all makes 2015 pretty exciting!

As someone who's basically an amateur and newcomer to this bitcoin business, I have spent hours upon hours researching what the best way for me to go about investing in Bitcoin is and aside from simply a direct buy in to the cryto-currency, there are no "affordable" ways to make a sturdy investment. Unless I've missed something lol
I'm not trying to come off as jealous of anyone who's in a better position in the bitcoin market (i.e. early adopters, etc), since I don't really have the funds to participate, but I do find it quite difficult at times. I guess my main point is that I saved up for a BFL Jalapeño, purchased (ordered?) it, and of course I have no idea when I'll get it or if it will even be profitable by the time I do.
Would canceling that order and shifting the money straight to buying bitcoins be a more a calculated option? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:12:48
Speaking of Blockchain.info, I have tried to log in to my account (which luckily I use for just "watch-only" addresses) and for some reason it keeps telling me that there is an error  decrypting the wallet and that my main password is incorrect, even though I have verified and reverified that I'm inputting the password correctly.
EDIT: Andddd now I'm locked out of my account for a few hours. What's the deal?

Not gonna lie, but I definitely commented under Snoop's facebook post about that signature vape pen and asked him to get them to accept bitcoin. Lolol probably just a coincidence though
Just bought one as well!

I own less than a whole Bitcoin and I have the same sensibility as you. I don't imagine getting ridiculously wealthy or anything, but there's this spirit about being involved with Bitcoin that makes me feel like my dreams of getting to see the world will one day come true. :')

Although I haven't had any "real" job yet, I can imagine despising the monotony of a 9-5 or any set amount of time one is required to be at work. I have a friend who's a dental lab tech and after he started working the typical shift, he said that it got kind of depressing in the beginning but of course eventually you get used to it.."living for the weekends" and all. 
For the main point though, I don't see full workforce automation because people will mostly want people working with them, across the counter so to speak, and for economic reasons. However, I have yet to witness (and I'm not old of course) technology slow down with respect to humanity's set paradigms..technology always seems to have a destabilizing effect, kind of like the effect Bitcoin might eventually have. So we won't have robots doing everything for us, but there are plenty of jobs that will definitely disappear because it is becoming cheaper and cheaper to run a machine than pay a person a wage.

They were discussing the raid on Silk Road and actually spoke about the resilience of Bitcoin in the face of the fall of Silk Road, which of course we all already knew. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:42:05
Definitely a win/win. I just wish I knew of people in my area that were interested. I've literally offered to sell all of my friends BTC, but not even one of them wants to take the effort to reach into their pocket and pull out a bill and hand it to me. Lol. I've told them I could get them any amount (well besides like hundreds of dollars worth), even tiny amounts like a couple bucks, but the interest just isn't there I guess.
@_date: 2013-11-26 06:50:24
I think the biggest issue that needs to made clear every time someone is introduced to bitcoin is that the word "bitcoin" refers to two different things at the same time. On one hand, the value that is exchanged between users is denominated in a currency called "bitcoin" while the entire payment network itself is also called "bitcoin". Commodity/Tool and Currency/Payment platform.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:22:40
I haven't had a problem like that, but I did have my Debit card to the very same bank account I have registered on Coinbase be accepted as a valid "Credit Card" alternative. So basically my back-up payment option is the exact same as my default payment option and I'm allowed to buy BTC instantly.
I feel like I'm cheating the system, but it worked and I haven't had any problems since. Lol
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:45:24
Ahhh, you're right. I wasn't here for that one so it tends to slip my mind.
@_date: 2013-11-30 18:29:08
It just sucks so damn much. There are people on this subreddit who talk about the "Market" providing fixes for these things eventually, but I just don't see it happening. 
I see people who sit idly by while innocent Bitcoiners are taken advantage of and we can't at least have a list of REAL and HONEST businesses and websites that take Bitcoin? Why not? Why isn't there an easily accessible and moderated list of non-scammer sites?
@_date: 2013-03-14 17:01:57

What kind of transactions would fit such a description? Or rather how would I find out the number and age of inputs? I'm just trying to send $5 worth to a friend and I can't even send that.
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:04:05
Ahh, it's awesome! I do think it needs some more refining though, maybe some volume/sound changes b/c sometimes the narrator and music kind of get jumbled together. The other criticisms about it needing to be shorter and edited a bit are obvious, but I think it's going in the right direction! 
I just love seeing the community creating such great Bitcoin content. It's like Bitcoin is marketed by the people who actually use it and care about it, rather than the way just about any other product in the world is marketed --- by professionals who know how to reel in customers.
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:02:32
Pretty sure wealth would still be concentrated in the most capable of hands in any case. The people with the most to invest, will own a majority of bitcoins as with every other commodity. In the case of BTC though, a lot of the Bitcoins currently owned are in the hands of a lucky few "early adopters".
@_date: 2013-09-25 13:15:19
What if the Difficulty is being driven by private mining companies and those who haven't shipped out their hardware yet? I've really wondered about this because the global Bitcoin hashrate goes up by so much after every Difficulty change, so if there's already enough hashing power to resume "profitability" after a Diff change, then it seems like the Diff would have to be being manipulated since the larger hashrate after the Diff change was already possible, just not yet implemented. Is there a way for this to be true? That those who have the hashing power are simply adding enough to where the Bitcoin Diff goes up more or less uniformly?
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:09:17
I'll just say this. I've had a Coinbase account for a few months and I've recently been able to get my account "verified" so I get instant Bitcoin deposits. Totally worth it. Zero complaints. Now I just have to find a way to not transfer ALL of my money into BTC. Lol
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:19:39
Congratulations! And welcome! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:51:04
My only advice would be not to over-analyze what you see in regards to Bitcoin. It's a currency that acts like commodity and no one knows what it's true nature is or it's true value for that matter. If it were to become even third or fourth in line with major Credit Card providers, I would at least say you'd see a price in the tens of thousands, but maybe more because I'm no mathematician. 
If you saw the Senate Hearing today, they spoke briefly about the inability for regulators to even accurately identify Bitcoin as "something" that can be regulated. There are literally no market definitions for Bitcoin. It's a new breed of something and that's why people herald it as a "paradigm shift!" because it seems impossible that most other currency forms will be able to compete once Bitcoin matures and more people become part of the community...therefore causing a large increase in price until equilibrium is reached and stability pervades. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:25:35
@_date: 2013-10-04 18:10:57
Believe it or not, the "regulation" they really referred to was the ability to have your bank account insured by the government, but not your Bitcoin wallet. In a sense, they defended a very positive regulatory position on BTC...although we all know how much effort it would take for the government to even attempt something like that.
Maybe the Bitcoin community could solve this issue of wallet insurance against hackers internally?
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:15:09
I honestly thought it was some kind of fluke when it happened. I mean, the fact the verifiable deposits appeared in my bank account within minutes was surprising.
@_date: 2013-12-21 17:33:43
I can't speak for all of but personally I believe that it will be the "future of currencies" or rather the "future of asset management" because of the inherent characteristics of the protocol. 
First of all, Bitcoin is much more than a currency in that any information can be stored in the blockchain and verified by the entire global network. This allows for community-verified ownership of anything you could classify as property and therefore would create a more or less irrefutable claim to ownership. Ex: deeds, marriage licenses, car titles, etc. 
As for Bitcoin as a currency or more likely as a store of value, it has a lot of possibility in my opinion. The near instantaneous, globally verified transactions allows for the most efficient and decentralized way to transfer value..I've read that what Bitcoin is has never happened before in history. The ability to have total control over your monetary assets is the most revolutionary part of the currency designation. Instead of companies withdrawing money from your bank account when you pay, you are making a personal decision to send them your money instead of giving them permission to take it. Irreversible transactions on a globally distributed "cloud" ledger.
Idk, it sounds like something so innovative like Bitcoin or something based off of the protocol could very well become a replacement for traditional currencies in the long run. I'm just here for the ride and because I believe in the possibilities.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:55:56
It's like baby Bitcoin's second heartbeat. The first being the April 2013 correction of course!
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:08:08
Well, then we a need a list of reputable ones. I lost money on this and I'm just wanting to make sure the real noobs don't lose theirs the same way. I consider myself pretty informed and not usually one to be scammed, but I just made a mistake and should've been much more diligent. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:18:13
So I set the fee lower on Armory and it won't let me send a transaction unless I include the standard amount of 0.0005. I don't understand!
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:50:08
So if I set 0.0001 as the transaction fee on the Bitcoin-qt, does that reflect accurately on Armory? Or should I adjust it on Armory as well? I heard about these changes to btc transaction fees but I didn't know they had already been lowered and implemented.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:54:59

I hope you have better luck than I have! I made a pretty detailed post like that one day and advertised it in a way that explained that I would be willing to help them get started with a small Bitcoin deposit, but no one was really that interested. 
Then again, my FB is populated with a lot of people who probably didn't even read the first word of the post, much less actually try to understand what I was discussing.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:56:26
Bitcoin, as protocol, and in my understanding, is meant to be a highway for all cryptocurrencies. Because of it's popularity and first mover status, it acts as a "reserve" currency for the rest. However, any cryptocurrency could technically form a value separate of bitcoin, but it would probably need a much larger user base to overtake btc.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:44:31
Sighh..The same thing has happened with me recently, except with two of my friends. They'll sit around and despair over the fact they only have a small amount of btc, but the thing is that I've been telling them to buy some since at least May. And it's not like I've been saying, "dude, take all that money for food and put it in btc instead, hehehe". Nahh, much more like "when you have extra cash lying around, like $20 or so, just buy a little btc and wait".
@_date: 2013-10-29 23:18:15
I completely understand. I've realized that most people really do just go about their lives completely oblivious to the fact that being tied to "work" (excluding work that you genuinely enjoy) is robbing you of your most valuable asset..ya know, time.
@_date: 2013-11-30 16:59:42
Alright, this is what I figured after various other factors. needs to compile a list of these scammer sites so ultra-noobs won't lose all their money trying to get these ridiculous deals.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:27:43
Well, you have the right idea. Don't put in any more than you can afford to lose and just believe in Bitcoin. Another thing, don't look at Bitcoin as some magical way to become an instant millionaire..that kind of thinking will get you nowhere and probably crying because you lost money.
So instead, spend time learning about BTC and understanding it's core principles and what we all hope it will become one day. Find something small and cheap, like a keychain or something, and make your first purchase after some research. It's really a great feeling imo.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:31:09
If you can convert Yuan to USD on the fly, you can create an account at BtcChina and trade there. I tried and I just can't relate with prices. Lol

Speaking of ads and simple exposure to Bitcoin, does anyone know of really good way to define and explain the "thing" that is Bitcoin to average people..say my friends or a parent? I would like to personally promote it as a starting point and try to grow awareness from there.

That sounds like one of several versions of heaven I could imagine. Normal strip clubs might lose their allure if people just paid in bitcoins though. No tossin' dollars anymore lol
@_date: 2013-12-22 15:44:14
This may go wayyy too far, but I really wish there was an app or some integration with Coinbase that allowed you to see how much % increase or decrease you have in your purchased btc net worth. Like if I purchase, 0.5 at $630 for $315 and I don't spend it and then a few days later I buy another 0.5 at $700 for $350 and subsequently don't spend it either. I would like to have an app that displays my daily percentage increase or decrease plus the dollar amount of that increase or decrease. 
In addition, I would love an app that I could input all of my altcoin investments into and then show similar statistics. It would eliminate my need to keep a completely written record of these price changes and such lol 
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:37:41

It will be..at some point. I listen to NPR pretty regularly and I know it takes some time for them to chop the program up into a podcast. They don't seem to have a segment up yet about Bitcoin, but I'll continue checking until they do.

Ahh, it makes me all tingly. I only have a little over 1 BTC, so I'm not expecting to afford a Tesla Model S or anything any time soon, but the increasing adoption just makes me hopeful for the future of money, wealth, and value in general. 
Like I was just talking to a friend of mine yesterday about interesting cultural changes Bitcoin will probably bring and I thought about the concept of "tipping addresses". At no time in history can I remember people outwardly advertising the ability to receive money just for the sake of it. On every Bitcoin forum, blog, website, etc, almost everyone has a BTC address for that altruistic tipper out there. What does that mean for the concept of value? 
It's just crazy to think that people would walk around in public advertising *your* ability to send him/her money, while it is the norm in the Bitcoin community to share wealth in some sense. 
So interesting.
@_date: 2013-11-09 03:23:57
I feel like Bitcoin has to be making some type of huge jump in relevance right at this very moment. For the first time ever I had the most in-depth discussion with my roommate about Bitcoin today and he has always been interested but never really talked seriously about it till today. Then another friend of mine told me that he was really thinking about sending me a message so he could get involved and understand it more...and he had no knowledge of the current price or anything. In another instance another friend's dad created his first Bitcoin wallet tonight! It's just seems so crazy.
Idk. It might all just be coincidences, but I feel like Bitcoin is spreading like wild fire or something right now! :D So Excite.
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:30:37

A similar attempt at getting some of my friends involved in Bitcoin I made a month or so ago was for my roommate's birthday. I bought him and his girlfriend a Bit-Card and sent them 0.01 BTC to start off..and I'm pretty sure they never check their balance, even though I send them tiny amounts ever so often. Lol
@_date: 2013-10-30 04:54:24
Speaking of Coinbase, everybody got upset when they started requiring the set up of a credit card for Instant deposits, but as I have just realized..you can use a Debit Card as long as it is Visa. Kinda surprised me that it wasn't necessary to have an actual "credit card".
So to clarify, if you want to be able to purchase Bitcoins "instantly", verify your Debit or Credit card on the site and there you have it! I did it in less than 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-30 17:50:58
Just looked up your username and saw that we have experienced the same scamming situation. I saw an awesome deal on a PS4 as well and now I'm fucking kicking myself for being so gullible. I just don't understand why the Bitcoin Black Friday site didn't monitor who they were advertising for.
I mean, if I was to put together such a site, I would make sure I wasn't advertising for a site claiming to have "too good to be true" deals or one that was made just 2 days ago.
@_date: 2013-10-30 03:06:40
Lol I won't claim to have an alternative for working, but I feel that there must be some real solution along the way. I mean, once technology becomes so fluid in society that automation replaces most traditionally human-controlled employment, there will have to be something for all those people to do. Hell, I'm an Economics major and I see any job I eventually get to be lost to automation by the time I'm 40 or so..well, except for counseling and being generally knowledgable about a topic.
The whole idea of "work" has just always stumped me and I could go on and on about it.

I agree, I thoroughly enjoy the tiny bit of mining I do with a few block erupters, but when my friends ask if they should do that to get Bitcoins, I give them a profit/day of my "free money" and it's always like $1 or so. I just tell them that buying Bitcoins guarantees you as much as you put in.
@_date: 2013-10-04 17:48:01
Will do. They'll have a podcast available once the show is over, but they also have recordings of the show at the website.

I wish I could help people out like you and others who just have a really hard time getting Bitcoins in general. I'm not some "high-roller" with a ton of BTC or anything, but I do have the ability to buy instantly on Coinbase and would work as intermediary if there was ANY secure way of guaranteeing people wouldn't scam the hell out of me.
