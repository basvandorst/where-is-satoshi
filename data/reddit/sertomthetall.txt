If you're in the US:
- Register on Circle.com about a week or two in advance to make sure there isn't some BS hold or waiting period. Link your bank account and all that jazz.
- Download Armory and the blockchain
- Buy Bitcoin from Circle, as soon as your account is credited you can send the Bitcoin to Armory and rest easy.

I agree with you, and that's why I believe that Bitcoin is right for some people and not for others. Until kids are raised with a pretty thorough understanding of computers, people simply will not understand how it works, and the time it would take them to learn is completely unexpected and, to them, unreasonable in a time of "quicker is better". It's just the world we live in...but I do believe that Bitcoin will keep its footing due to its outstanding potential for revolutionizing our digital world.

USD and other fiat currencies are more widely used for crime and fraud than cryptocurrencies. The only reason Bitcoin isn't regulated is because it doesn't need to be.
Imo, if you fall for these scams (which are pretty blatant), that's a problem with whatever's between the computer chair and the screen...ie: the user.

Exactly. Besides, there's no rule against becoming more secure once you're more familiar with how wallet software and addresses work.

I believe PayPal just starting allowing merchants to accept Bitcoin, but I'm not sure if it's available for consumers or not. Might be worth a look.

Depending on where you created the 'test' address, you might be able to retrieve the private key and import the address into a wallet program.

It could have something to do with the fact that you're posting on behalf of a '4 gold' company...if I saw that a cash4gold place was giving out free currency for a facebook like I'd ignore it. Granted, bitcoin would be a good way to monetize likes/shares, but maybe try it from your personal facebook profile first...you may have better luck.

What's the situation with taxes and other state/federal stuff like that? I know there's a guy who calls himself "the Natural Man", he doesn't recognize any laws, and so he lives in nature and is allowed to forage/hunt for food, not sure if he has a license, outside city limits since he's technically considered an animal by law. It's actually a very interesting and potentially inspiring scenario to check out, it's made me up to about 40% truly sure I want to just move out to nature (prepared, of course) and live a simple, natural life, free from the rest of humanity and living...simply for the sake of living. Typing this, I'm more sure that I want to do this, haha :)
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:57:47
That's why thinking of it in terms of just bitcoin is useful, because as long as you've spent only what you can afford to lose on bitcoin, you won't be throwing yourself off a cliff if bitcoin tanks.
Anything else that happens to bitcoin, in such a way that bitcoin is taken out of circulation somehow, will only raise the value of the remaining bitcoin.

I see your confusion...I meant "addresses will always be there" as in, you can send bitcoin to them without having them open on your screen...you can send money to your bank account without physically being at the bank or on online banking.
The rest of your complaints are personal opinions, not factually correct. People can use their addresses however they wish, and I've successfully explained addresses to people using bank accounts as an example. 
Sorry if you don't agree with me?
@_date: 2014-12-23 04:42:47
Yes! Folding thank you :) 
Could you explain why you feel Bitcoin only has the potential to affect a small fraction of the global population, when it is still very much in its infancy? 
Keep in mind that Bitcoin already has a solid foothold on a global scale, and more and more people are becoming interested in Bitcoin because of the financial freedom. 
Let us not also forget the Blockchain technology that has the potential to revolutionize many existing systems that are highly susceptible to corruption.
Edit: I just feel it's a bit early to write off Bitcoin due to its energy use, when its energy use is relatively small. As new solar and wind technology is developed and deployed, our energy demand will be matched by a growing energy supply.
@_date: 2014-12-30 13:51:47
Just an aside thought: As a Bitcoin user myself, it's easy to see how people get so confused with how to actually use Bitcoin 99.9999% safely. However, as an IT professional in 2014, it's completely unacceptable that people find this level of computer use and knowledge confusing and off-putting.
Is it truly that difficult to expend some effort and learn something new that, in reality, is loads more convenient than using fiat? It's just...different :/
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:54:02
I think bitcoin has potential by itself, regardless of who uses it. It's a solid system that needs some tweaking, but it's definitely the foundation for something revolutionary that I think a lot of people will prefer over dealing with bank BS.
@_date: 2014-06-11 12:41:03
How much BTC do you buy at one time? Generally, transactions require more confirmations if it's for a large amount. Just a thought.
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:49:58
Sorry to hear that. If you ever give bitcoin another shot, keep in mind that it's a very long-term investment...if you stick with it and ride the waves (this might be the 3rd I've seen since this time last year) you'll have a better time of it. Good luck.
@_date: 2014-09-23 12:42:47
I think the selling point of Bitcoin shouldn't be its price, but its function and the possibilities the blockchain is capable of. 
Besides, low cost means less risk for newcomers, and cheap coins for the rest of us :)
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:50:35
I don't know if this is still true but I believe Bitcoin is legally considered property, making it subject to the law you mentioned. I'm on the road in 5 min so I can't look it up, but I'm pretty sure this is accurate.
@_date: 2014-01-05 18:39:03
It's a public ledger...you can see how much anybody is paid regardless of how they use their wallet/addresses, so unless it's a personal issue there's nothing wrong with using the same addresses over and over again.
@_date: 2014-10-02 14:05:22
Are you looking for secure long-term storage or convenience?
Long-term storage w/ high security: [Armory (PC wallet)](
Convenience w/ good security: [Electrum (PC wallet)](
Convenience: [Circle.com (WEB WALLET)](
**NOTE: Never keep large amounts of money in web wallets (also called hot wallets), as you are entrusting the security of your Bitcoin to a third party in some way or another. To keep from losing your Bitcoin investment, keep the majority in Armory and transfer however much you can afford to lose to the web/hot wallet for convenient spending.**

I must have read incorrectly...you're planning on meeting the ransomware's demands?
No no no no no.
If you have to wipe his hard drive, so be it. But never, EVER, try to negotiate with ransomware. Please try everything possible before wiping the drive, though.
I would boot into Dr. Web/linux from a flash drive and backup any data your client needs, then wipe the drive and reinstall the OS, but I'm just a desktop technician. There are probably more complete methods of data retention and ransomware removal that I'm not aware of.
DON'T PAY THE RANSOM. Think about it...what would paying a ransom in basically anonymous digital currency do in terms of unlocking a specific computer? Unless the ransomware knows your new bitcoin wallet address and is automated to unlock a computer based off incoming amounts from your address, there's absolutely nothing stopping the ransomware from simply staying active. Then you've just paid a huge ransom for absolutely nothing.
@_date: 2014-11-22 22:51:35
Exactly. It *used* to be an issue when it was possible to fork the blockchain with a single graphics card, but nowadays blocks are being solved at such a high difficulty there's virtually next to no risk unless mining farms are able to pop up overnight, which I doubt. However...there is **always** a chance of a double-spend occurring. 
Yes, a company like Starbucks can afford to lose out on the occasional double-spend...but smaller businesses can't. At least, this was the case a year ago. Now, it's generally not a *huge* concern, but it's something to keep in the back of your mind. I assume there will be some kind of insurance against double-spends in the future, but as of right now the best you can hope for is Circle.com
@_date: 2014-01-28 21:12:19
The production of bitcoin is programmed into the functions that miners' mining hardware processes. The code that the miners' hardware works on also controls the production rate of bitcoin by increasing or decreasing the rate at which block difficulty grows. 
In short, the only way to 'make' bitcoin is to mine them. There is no other way to create bitcoin programmed into the source code.
@_date: 2014-12-19 03:58:30
People are freaking out about price drops because they think they can use Bitcoin to get rich, which they can't. They're treating it as a reliable and predictable stock, which it is not. They are also trying to use it as a currency, which it is not. Bitcoin is a volatile stock that you can spend at any time. Once all 21 million coins are mined, Bitcoin can actually become a currency. This is how I've understood it and I've never had any issues with financial insecurity or theft or what have you.
I started with Bitcoin when it was ~$240 back in March/April of 2013...back then I mined an entire Bitcoin with my GPU and bought another, then used the majority of it to buy Xmas gifts. I saw the price skyrocket to over $1000 in a week then crash back down not too long after, that's why I just sit back and ~~openly mock~~ laugh at the people that freak out and panic sell over a drop of $10 or so and claim that it's the end of Bitcoin. They have absolutely no idea what to expect from Bitcoin, when they shouldn't expect anything at all. It's a completely insane and wild ride, but it's a damn fun ride that beats out the "It's a Small World" ride ANY day.
@_date: 2014-10-04 21:49:42
I agree with that point of view, I think either you misunderstood my comment, or my comment was actually hard to understand. Either way, I'm all for Bitcoin, whether the price be high or low.

As I understood it, is around to mock *Bitcoin itself*, not its user base. If you're only interested in making fun of the user base, just subscribe to are plenty of cult-ish posts in to keep you occupied. 
As to your question, once you understand how the blockchain works you may be more inclined to help figure out the scalability and efficiency issues you clearly see. 
* In terms of scalability, the blockchain is only at ~15-20 GB (guessing, presently on the throne and can't be bothered to check atm) and computer storage is passing 10TB...there will need to be a solution to storage size, but not for many, many years.
* I'm not sure how the blockchain is inefficient, could you clarify?
AFAIK, the blockchain is revolutionary because it's a database that keeps a perfect, cryptographically-sound ledger of every piece of data stored in it, meaning it can be used for data storage, voting process reform, side chain technologies that I honestly haven't read into at all, and a whatever else you can imagine such a database being used for. 
Have 100 bits ( ) as a show of faith that not all Bitcoiners are of the cultist mentality, and honestly just want what's best for everyone by having Bitcoin "reformat" the world's economies and bring forth a new era of financial freedom and prosperity for generations to come!

I know this is kind of selfish and impractical, but I feel like making people learn a new process should be necessary because it helps them understand how vulnerable they really are. 
Bitcoin is about taking responsibility, and whoever complains that they shouldn't have to go through so many steps to secure something digital in an increasingly technological and web-based world, should, in my opinion, not use Bitcoin. 
I'm far from a crypto expert but I made a paper backup of my Armory wallet and have had no issues whatsoever with restoring or transferring  , simply because I'm careful. I make a new backup every few weeks just in case, and I make sure to have it printed at some point in case my computer crashes. Granted, I'm a freelance desktop and networking technician and have more IT knowledge than the average person, but really...come on.

Check out [SnapCard]( they let you buy anything with bitcoin as long as the merchant has a shopping cart function :)
Edit: I have used them numerous times and have received outstanding customer service. I used them to buy all my Xmas gifts last year and only had one issue regarding an item that never shipped. I emailed SnapCard about it, they fixed it with the website I ordered from, and when two of the item arrived and I asked SnapCard about it they told me to keep the second item free of charge for my trouble! I recommend them to everyone who asks me how to buy stuff with Bitcoin from sites that don't accept it yet :)

Listen man.
If you want people to feel sorry for you and offer condolences for your inability to follow basic common sense, I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place.
There are warnings all over the place against doing exactly what you've done. I've told countless people over the last two years to never, *EVER* invest more in Bitcoin than they can afford to lose. Why? Because it is literally the wild west of finance. There is no rhyme or reason to the hectic price swings (save for huge events like MtGox collapsing), and there aren't any safety nets if things go south...you are on your own, and your Bitcoin losses, gains, and security are all solely your responsibility. 
Here's a bit of perspective for you. You panic every time the price drops $30-$40, while a year ago the price would change by $100 overnight, frequently. I remember when the price broke $1000 and I thought that Bitcoin was finally going to make me rich, then maybe a month or so later it tanked. Hard. Thank god I never tried to make money by trading Bitcoin, because I'd have lost all of it and I wouldn't have been able to afford Xmas gifts that year. See? I would have only lost money for Xmas gifts, which has never been a priority for me, so I wouldn't be where you are now, posting to Reddit looking for reassurance.
I honestly can't give you any trading advice because treating Bitcoin as a reliable trading platform with the expectation of getting rich is absolutely foolish and I have no experience with it. It is simply unreliable in the short-term due to its nature. You should have realized that early on and prepared for the worst like a responsible person. Instead you only saw dollar signs and got smacked around because of the tunnel vision. It's happened to others and you certainly won't be the last, but treat this as a huge wake-up call that something in your Bitcoin trading fundamentals needs to change, immediately, if you want to keep at it.
The truth hurts, but you grow from it. Imagine if we all just said "wow man that sucks, you did all you could and the universe just hates you"...you'd be in the same spot you're in, under the impression that your losses were somehow out of your control, and you wouldn't have any idea what to do next. 
TL;DR: You done messed up and yes, it sucks, so stop freaking out and don't make the same mistakes again. 
Here's the only sound advice I can provide: If you want to see profit with Bitcoin trading, buy however much you want and store it away "to be opened in 5/10/15 years". It's mathematically designed to rise in purchasing power over time. It is, by nature, a very long-term investment.

Don't get me wrong, the info you had was alright, but the article itself needs to be cleaned up a bit to fit proper grammar and syntax.

You can add your own *thoughts* and *ideas* to any piece of work you do (except probably instruction manual editors), but as for typewritten style (ie: "word1 .. word 2", or "word1 word 2 ! !"), you should probably keep it out of published writing because it can come off as unprofessional. By all means, do what you please, but it's something to consider :)

Absolutely not. Just because the price drops doesn't mean BTC isn't doing well...it's been adopted by very large companies and is now even insured on circle.com, which makes it even more valuable, if anything.

@_date: 2014-11-23 01:38:25
I concur, I was using the graphics card as an indicator of how far back I'm talking, when mining actually was such an 'anyman' market that if you could mine a few blocks in a row and broadcast your alternate block, you could effectively fork the blockchain. As far as I know, that's the concept behind a 51% attack, though I could be completely mistaken and should shut up, in which case, shutting up. 
@_date: 2014-12-23 04:26:06
The power to run the Bitcoin network is a lot, but the power needed for the Internet is way larger (I have no numbers to reference). 
Coincidentally, check out SETI It's like mining, but you use the power to search for abnormal signals coming in from patches of space. SETI stands for "Search for Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence", so you know, aliens. 
There's a similar program for cancer research...maybe not cancer, genome study? I dunno, it's health-related.
@_date: 2014-09-23 10:56:10
Your point is valid if everything you said is actually how it is...but it isn't. I personally want the price to go as low as possible so I can finally buy more/whole coins again.
Also, when I was able to mine with a GPU I didn't sell a single bit of it. I've never sold any BTC back into USD. I can see your point, but it's pretty sensational in nature.

Loss*, and I personally am not concerned with people knowing where to send me bitcoin. While reusing addresses won't work for pure anonymity, most beginners probably aren't trying to be 100% anonymous, and this method allows them to easily use their addresses without worrying about deleting one with a balance. There's nothing stopping them from making their wallet as secure as they want once they're comfortable in their understanding of addresses, but as the title says...this is directed at beginners who find bitcoin addresses difficult to understand. Personally, I have a business wallet and a personal wallet that I keep separate.
For the average person, thinking of certain bitcoin in terms that they are already familiar with will hopefully help them become accustomed to bitcoin more quickly and actually see the differences first-hand. It allows them to start using bitcoin sooner and it gives them a model to work with that's easy for them to understand and doesn't jeopardize their wallet's security/integrity.
Is this easy-to-understand method secure? Hells no...especially if you really care about being 100% anonymous. All the steps required to make a 100% secure and anonymous transaction are way beyond your average beginner, which is something that needs to change. You mentioned bip32 (bit32 perhaps, I forget if it's 'bip' or 'bit') in another post...your concerns with this method are a thing of the past once that kicks in.
Apart from personal opinion, the only thing "wrong" with my method is that people could eventually figure out where to reliably send you bitcoin as opposed to asking for a new address every time.

I don't see what's so hard to understand about typing in a number with only one decimal point, max, that expresses the exact value of bitcoin without making users revert back to 'fiat-think' and convert.

True. Though in terms of bringing people together in a happy and peaceful environment, marijuana almost never fails. Have you ever seen two people fight after using marijuana?

I'm not sure what else can invoke such an environment where people can actually take interest in any topic whatsoever and debate its ups and downs without getting upset or angry.

BTC doesn't depend on fiat for anything...not sure what you mean here. Just because the USD isn't doing well, that doesn't mean BTC isn't doing well. Could you try to clarify your point with an example so it's easier to understand? I'm sure some of what you were trying to say got lost in ambiguity.

Bitcoin as a currency may indeed fail, but the real prize is the blockchain. The blockchain's potential for revolutionizing existing systems such as voting or email (among others) is huge. Bitcoin is also still evolving due to its open-source nature...if Bitcoin doesn't make it, something very similar will take its place.

There are a few virus removal steps you could take. Speaking as a desktop technician with a penchant for all things PC-related, here's what I'd try first, then go from there:
Side-note: always try booting into safe mode to see if you can access your data to back it up, and potentially remove the ransomware without having to do anything I've listed below.
PLEASE NOTE: This process takes a long time. If you have absolutely no patience (or simply no idea how) to fix your computer, just bring it to a small repair shop as opposed to Best Buy or Staples...small shops do the crazy stuff that the big box stores won't, and get more reliable and thorough results...unless they're simply scum. In fact, I can tell you with 100% certainty that Best Buy only uses one CD for software/some hardware issues that they can't find an outsourced solution for, and that's what you're *really* paying them $200-$300 for...but I digress.
IMPORTANT: Make sure you have a method of reinstalling your operating system if the need arises. If you bought your PC prebuilt from a big box store (Best Buy, Staples, etc), your Product Key can usually be found on the case somewhere, or by calling them up as they should have your info on file.
* download/install DrWeb or another Linux OS onto a CD or USB drive. I prefer DrWeb as the OS is designed for tough virus removal and nothing else.
* boot into the CD/USB drive and back up any user data you need, another USB drive or external storage medium would be ideal. Keep the device plugged into your computer to scan it with DrWeb's tools.
NOTE: If this fails, try using cloud-based storage. Usually I tell people not to use to cloud, but it's hard to deny that it has its uses, especially in this situation.
* attempt to remove the ransomware from your main OS using DrWeb's built-in tools, use any other Linux-friendly tools you can find. I'll assume your OS is Windows, because, well, yea...viruses.
* if virus removal fails, take note of all installed programs and format your hard drive. If the option is there, do NOT use "Quick Format", instead choose the longer and more thorough format. 
* reinstall OS and restore your data, then boot into safe mode. Run any Windows-friendly tools you have. McAfee, Norton's Antivirus, and AVG do not count, unless you're using a rootkit version of those softwares. I think McAfee has one that's pretty good, and you should also check out McAfee Stinger. Avoid the regular AV software, it's just not powerful enough.
At this point you can boot into Windows normally and hope for the best. Don't get me wrong, the format will have almost definitely removed it, but your user data may still be infected, hence the scans in safe mode.
I sincerely wish you the best of luck...ransomware is no walk in the park, but when it comes to computers you should know there's ALWAYS a way to beat viruses. You may suffer heavy casualties, but you will emerge victorious...at least that's why I do what I do :)

You want to know in *advance* when a certain number of bitcoin will be mined? For $1, the amount of work it would take to get the info you want, it is not worth it in the slightest. Up it to $50 or $100 and you'll have better luck, but still...this is NOT a "simple question".

I'm at work and can't check out the program yet, but I definitely will...this looks like a great way to help people familiarize themselves with Bitcoin, and I can absolutely see 3D being a catalyst for wider adoption of crypto-currencies in general. It's a shame you're consistently downvoted, it'd be nice if thought went into every vote that is cast instead of gut reaction, but hopefully 7th Continent will deliver and go above+beyond expectations so reddit trolls are rendered powerless.
Since there's not a lot of research I can do atm regarding 7C, can you break the in-game Bitcoin system down into easily-digestible tidbits for us to gobble up? The extra transparency would soothe a lot of troubled minds, I think :)

How do you learn a new language? Advanced stuff before beginner stuff, or beginner before advanced? Bitcoin is no different.
You're proposing that people start using bitcoin with every bit of security possible, regardless of how much trouble they have understanding the ins and outs of the system, which will almost assuredly lead to more lost passwords and security flaws than if you were to start new users off slow and have them gain knowledge at their own pace. That's just how learning works...maybe you're different, but like I said in a previous post, if you don't agree with this method then shush and let people use it if they do agree with it. 
If it'll make you feel better, I'll make an Intermediate and Advanced post as well, though you'd probably be better off making them.

I think Circle and ChangeTip both have great potential to make PayPal completely obsolete in the next few years. Not because I have some crazy insider knowledge, but because unlike PayPal, Circle and ChangeTip simply *work*. There's absolutely 0 reason to not use Changetip over PayPal/Western Union to send money, and since Circle has made acquiring Bitcoin so gosh darned easy, it seems there's really no way PayPal can compete anymore.
Edit: Not to mention the recent Microsoft integration! That is going to speed things up immensely! Can't believe I forgot about this.

I would argue that any security vulnerability inherent in Bitcoin can be dealt with with little effort. Whoever uses Bitcoin needs to have the drive to at least take SOME action in the safety of their money, and setting a password and copy/pasting Bitcoin addresses then *actually double-checking* should NOT be considered "unnecessary". 
As for usability difficulties, I have absolutely no difficulty using Bitcoin, and neither do countless other Bitcoin users. It takes computer knowledge that, at this point, EVERYONE should have, given the integration of technology in every aspect of our lives. If people do not have that basic level of knowledge, that is an issue with them, not Bitcoin.

I use it the same way that you do. I'll definitely buy more if the price stays below $400, and I hold it till I need something and I'm low on USD. 
I see Bitcoin as the first step towards making the blockchain an invaluable part of our technological lives. It can handle money, and Bitcoin clearly demonstrates that function quite well. However, due to Bitcoin's shortcomings I don't believe that it is the end-all-be-all of cryptocurrencies. Take a look at altcoins...they're all providing something that Bitcoin doesn't, even if it's just a different (faster/slower) distribution rate. I don't know what the end product will be, and anyone who claims to be privvy to that information can go jump off a bridge. But when the ultimate cryptocurrency is created, we'll see just how powerful a tool the blockchain can be.

Sorry, as far as I had understood, the first time around everyone was pretty ticked about it, but maybe I misunderstood the public outcry as them being dumb and you being correct. I really don't care about Gentoo users vs Windows users. My point was this: when it comes to people's money, do not make a choice for them that they can make themselves. Always leave an arbitrary option disabled, provide the documentation required to tell users what the option does...then leave the decision to turn it on up to them.

Once all 21 million bitcoin is mined, the price will regulate itself independently of any other currency, and its role as a true currency will begin. Until then, it's purely speculation as to how much bitcoin will ever be worth. I can tell you that mathematically, if the price remains the same and if all 21 million bitcoin were distributed evenly to a population of 8-9 billion (low estimate of the Earth's population at the time all bitcoin is mined), 1 bitcoin now will be worth 0.002 bitcoin then. Assuming the price will keep around $1,000/BTC, that means $2 now will be worth ~$1,000 by the time all 21 million bitcoin is mined. This also means that 0.002 BTC now will be worth 0.000002 BTC. It's a deflationary currency...the value only rises over time, independent of other currencies.
That's the math that's programmed into bitcoin, using estimated variables for price (relative to USD) and population. 
TL;DR: No matter what, the value of bitcoin will rise in the long run, relative to itself.

You're trying to connect two ideas that really can't be compared. Bitcoin is completely unrelated to stopping/preventing ebola, whereas condoms are only kind of, just *kind of*, related to stopping/preventing the spread of AIDS.
I know where you're coming from though, and at one point in my Bitcoin history I might have claimed the same, but realistically there's no reason why ebola would spur Bitcoin adoption/growth, though I will concede that it *could* due to indirect reasons (no truly sanitary bank notes, etc).

Calling someone an idiot isn't criticism. Spouting your negative opinion of OP's actions is not criticism either. You haven't given a single argument apart from "He didn't sell high, what an idiot," and that's barely an argument...especially if OP made it perfectly clear he's thinking long-term and in that mindset this dip in Bitcoin's value really isn't as big a deal as everyone's making it out to be. If people bought in at $900, that sucks for them. That's no reason to verbally abuse OP for telling people to chill out and think long-term. How do you know he posted "proudly"? In my eyes, he was trying to get people to stop running around like chickens with their heads cut off.

You don't need to have vast financial knowledge to use Bitcoin, you just have to be good at using a computer.

I understand that, but this is drifting away from "beginner-friendly". 
You raise a good point about being able to track address traffic, but unless a beginner is planning on making high-volume transactions and keeping the majority of their bitcoin in a single address, this 'entry' method will help them manage their bitcoin in a way that they're already familiar with, which is the point of this post. It definitely isn't 100% secure/anonymous, but if that's the road that a beginner is looking to walk down then they can find plenty of information from other posts. 


No, because I would have trusted them to keep that information private. I already know the blockchain is publishing my transactions, but it's a hell of a lot harder to determine any identifying information from the blockchain than it is from publicized bank records.

Bitcoin can be stored safely in any operating system...but it's your job to make up for the lost security that Linux will provide. 
For example, I use bitcoin on a Windows 7 machine, but I've never been hacked and I've never been robbed, and my security isn't even that strong. I'm just smart about where I go on the web, what I download, and how to better protect my computer. If I need to sign up on a site in order to see what it's all about, I do that with the help of the MaskMe extension in Firefox so my email and password are both relatively secure.
If you lost bitcoin, it's because your computer isn't under as many layers of protection as it should be...Linux just takes away the need for as many layers. I recommend ClamWin for a free anti-virus tool to see if your computer has any viruses left over from previous scans. I'd also recommend using Firefox as a browser, and enable the Master Password. For extensions, get DoNotTrackMe, MaskMe, MasterPassword+, NoScript, Self-Destructing cookies, and while we're at it, get Adblock Edge, cause fuck ads. 
I'm sure there are more extensions that offer more  layers of protection, but these should be more than enough to get you started and keep you secure, without the need for determining how many grains of sand are on all of eastern Siberia's models' asses by noon on the Summer solstice each time you want to order from Foodler.

It's as simple as finding another pool, signing up, and changing your miner software settings to point to the new pool. If you have CG Miner, edit the .config file to point to the new pool URL, the new worker you created, and the password for the worker. Same if you use a .bat file to run CG Miner. The same goes for any other software...just be sure to withdraw your BTC from the old pool first (if you meet the minimum, if there is one) so you don't forget about it.
Edit: What said...if you did it once, do the same thing again.
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:14:08
It isn't a permanent method that should be used. I have stated that it is not secure, but you seem to miss the parts where I say "Users can start less secure to get used to the system, and then get more secure as they become more familiar". Do you think it's a good idea to flood new users with so much  information that they can't keep track of it all and give up entirely? Because that's usually what happens...bitcoin is NOT layman-friendly...it requires some getting used to. Not everyone is a genius like you.

I mean, you should always purge your PC of viruses instead of relying on SMS verification, but assuming you can't for whatever reason, computer B should stay off the same network as computer A. Viruses like to travel through networks very much.
Use B as cold storage and only use A for Bitcoin stuff if you have to. The SMS verification is pretty reliable, but as always, when it comes to Bitcoin it's better to be safe than sorry.
Step one in a perfect world would be to purge all viruses before accessing any info that could jeopardize your blockchain.info account or your Bitcoin in any way. 
Edit: i apparently skimmed the part where you mentioned the hacker taking control of your computer. This is entirely possible, so purge all viruses instead of relying on SMS verification...just to be safe. Is it worth losing control of your account for the sake of a virus or three?

Well, since you're probably serious, what if you simply want 25 addresses instead of 26?


Then they've lost their wallet and that sucks. For the sake of this post, I will assume that people have access to their wallet and addresses.
It's tough to be interested in a new computer-based financial system and want to use it right away without having some idea of how to think of it in terms that make sense to you, which is what I'm trying to help alleviate.

You are correct. If Bitcoin users can not handle price swings, which have been a part of Bitcoin since the early days, then they are looking at Bitcoin the wrong way.

This article is so biased that doesn't take into account the significant advances Bitcoin has made this year...adoption by Microsoft, insured deposits at circle.com, and a steadily-growing community that are in favor of a currency that can't be manipulated by greedy people with too much power, to name a few. 
Bitcoin is nowhere close to being a "bad investment", unless all you see are dollar signs, in which case you have other issues that need more of your attention.

When you use banks, you think of fees, rates, percentages, and your money is in the hands of other people who you have to trust. But when you use Bitcoin, you can easily and securely store your money however you like, as well as send funds to anyone for any reason, instantly, without fees, without 3rd parties, wherever Internet is sold...'nuff said?

It's been a year or so since I last mined anything so I can't speak to the exact details. However, per my understanding, even if there is only one miner mining, blocks will be found because the difficulty level (basically, the time it takes to solve/mine a block) automatically compensates for network hashrate. This is why it was extremely easy to fork the blockchain back in the early days, when the network hashrate was still in the MB/s range, vs the TB/s range it is now (I believe). 
If I understand what you're asking, yes, you are correct in that if miners stop mining, Bitcoin essentially shuts down, as transactions will not be processed. However, with so many active miners, the chance of that happening is slim to none...especially because I'll take up mining again if the network hashrate ever drops to GPU-friendly levels again :) Besides, if transactions ever stop being processed, the existing Bitcoin can be stored on paper backups from existing wallet software and used like paper money/bonds/etc...people will get creative, as there are some people who have invested quite a lot in Bitcoin and would want to keep using it however they could...the community really is solid when it comes down to it, despite the nonsense that occurs in this subreddit.
In terms of block size (one-hundred 100-bit transactions vs one-hundred 300-bit transactions), if I'm not mistaken the block size has something to do with setting the difficulty, but I very well could be wrong. Regardless of difficulty, larger blocks and smaller blocks all produce the same amount of BTC, which is halved every X amount of years, or whenever the network hashrate reaches a certain point and the community agrees to make the change. Again, community solidarity will often keep the boat afloat.
If I missed anything, my apologies!

I mines a whole coin and bought another back when they were $240 (March/April 13' I believe), haven't sold any but I've certainly gotten my money's worth. I used about half to buy XMas gifts that year!

Yes. It is a deflationary currency, by the time all 21 million bitcoin are mined, even if only one person is using bitcoin, the value of 1 BTC will rise. 1 BTC now (at $1000 for example) will be worth 0.002 BTC, meaning its value will rise (in whatever currency) by 200...I think...I'm not a mathematician, but the math coded into bitcoin's code only allows to the value to rise over time. Look up the term "deflationary currency" to read more about how it works. This isn't my own personal opinion, this is how bitcoin is designed to work.
If you're worried about bitcoin becoming illegal and people not using it...well, take marijuana for instance. It hasn't been legal for over 100 years, but people still use it daily. I'll certainly keep my bitcoin client running for as long as possible, regardless of what happens to bitcoin in the future.

Sadly enough, a lot of newcomers are at this level of technological understanding...or lower. But Bitcoin is definitely getting easier and easier to learn and adopt!

As a GPU miner from the good ole days (March-April 2013) I will say this: If I had to choose between earning free bitcoin just because I could, and mining bitcoin to keep the currency going, I would choose the latter. 
Your post is worded horribly so I could barely understand what I think was your point...but if you're asking, "removing the hard limit would be appealing to miners because they could make free bitcoin, so why don't they do that", I would answer, "Because mining for something important means a fuckload more than mining for a pointless cause."

'Displacing traditional payment methods' does not mean the same thing as 'alternative payment methods':
'Displacing traditional payment methods' means disrupting, getting rid of, or replacing traditional payment methods.
'Alternative payment methods' means offering a different payment method that still allows for existing payment methods to exist and operate normally.

So...nothing, in the sense that I don't trust in our government, and our currency's purchasing power has done nothing but decline over the last 50ish years.
Bitcoin is nothing but an alternative to traditional currency. It operates the same way, except that it's a lot more secure and it can't be manipulated to serve private ends.
Edit: Also, almost everyone who I've asked, "What backs the US dollar" has answered "gold", with a questioning inflection which tells me they aren't even  sure themselves.

Since you'll be booting into Ubuntu, viruses on Windows will not be able to run, let alone copy over automatically as the operating systems are simply different...think of trying to run Windows *anything* on a Mac without Wine or vice versa...it just doesn't work.
The way you set up the flash drive also makes a difference. You have to format it to FAT32, and the liveUSB version of Ubuntu doesn't save changes made, so if a virus did manage to lodge itself somewhere, it'd be deleted when the system shuts down. You can change the size of the flash drive partition so that nothing else apart from Ubuntu, Electrum, and your private key can fit on it, but that can get a bit dicey and is really just another safety measure. 
The cool thing about the flash drive setup is any computer will work, Ubuntu will only use the hardware in the computer it needs, and it will not mount other hard drives that are present in the computer unless you manually mount them, so if I'm assuming correctly there isn't a chance for a virus to affect the flash drive. 
Then again, I've never tried to infect my USB wallet lol. So far, no issues on my end though, so it's either working as I described above or my security habits are sufficient.
@_date: 2014-03-22 13:39:18
Look at it this way: you can buy more for less :)
Also, mathematically speaking, the purchasing power of bitcoin will rise...that's how it's designed. So something that costs 1 bitcoin now will cost only 0.001 bitcoin down the road. Personally, I'm holding on to at least 0.15 to see how much it'll be worth in a few years...it'll definitely be worth it, but to what degree, nobody can really say. Patience :)

I recommend [Armory]( or [Circle]( for secure storage options...though I would highly recommend against storing the majority of your Bitcoin in a web-hosted wallet...for majority storage, Armory all the way.

Unless they have a change of heart, or you can hack their servers and send yourself back your bitcoin, I'm afraid not.

They also claim to be using BFL products, which is sketchy by itself, considering BFL's lackluster history.

First off, are you a native English speaker, or is it a secondary language?
Second, spell-check only corrects spelling mistakes, not grammar. Due to poor grammar and syntax, many of the 'correct' words in your article are in fact incorrect. The first three words, "That's you choice", should be "That's *your* choice". I'd change that to say something else though, it seems unecessarily defensive from the start.
First paragrah is one big grammatical clusterfuck, here's a corrected version:


I took the liberty of re-writing some parts that were confusing to read, but in general I hope you see the differences. Spell-check is good for correcting a difficult word, but not for determining the flow and style of a piece of writing. For example, "Goat jump orange halt golf touchdown" will come back 100% correct from a spell check...but it's obviously gibberish. The same thing happened with your article...the words are *technically* correct, but grammatically the whole article is just wrong.
At least you were able to convey your message enough that it can be corrected, I've seen some bits of writing that were pretty much like the "Goat jump orange..." example I mentioned.

Please don't blame Coinbase for something isn't under their control. They only ask for your identifying information because you're asking to buy such a large amount of an unsecurable asset, and they need to be as safe as possible in case you're a scammer. Also...you're looking to *quickly* buy and sell large amounts of bitcoin with USD, and you expect the road to be paved with golden bricks and have absolutely zero bank interference? 
Consider the fact that one of the currencies you're using belongs to one of the most financially corrupt countries in the world...do you think you could be bothered to wait a bit longer than 24 hours and be sure that you stand at least SOME chance of getting your money back if something goes wrong?
If you're going to use bitcoin, please learn patience, and don't look at it as a good way to get rich quick...that has only worked if you happen to have a long-forgotten wallet from 2009 or so with hundreds of bitcoin sitting in it.
TL;DR: Don't cry over a $50 price change...and learn to be patient.

I see it as a more secure, anonymous, and tamper-proof alternative to existing payment/financial systems, and I believe that being backed by a conscious and attentive community that takes pride in this new frontier it's created for itself makes bitcoin a very real contender to finance/money as it presently exists. 
In my opinion, the ideology of bitcoin is to give people complete control over their own money again, and to do so using a system that integrates seamlessly with current and developing technologies while ensuring financial security by relying on mathematics rather than humans.

Bitcoin operates independently of banks...that's the whole point of bitcoin. If banks suddenly stopped recognizing bitcoin as a currency people could still use it, but the community would set its own value. Hopefully, a general consensus would emerge and things would carry on...it would just be much harder to buy and trade bitcoin legitimately.
Bitcoin still has its own practicality outside of being a trade-able asset, at least that's how I feel. I'll still find ways to use it if the legitimized market crashes, because it's still an awesome payment system that can be implemented into a great number of existing technologies.

Physically losing a computer and giving complete control of your bitcoin to a third party are two different things entirely. Yes, they both compromise the safety of your bitcoin, if that's what you're getting at?
If you have wallet software installed on your computer, it is under your control...if you lose the computer, it's your fault, but that's because it's 100% under your control. If you put all your money in an online wallet, you do not have control over your bitcoin and if the site goes black, your bitcoin is uninsured. 
Keeping bitcoin on an offline computer at all times is the safest way to keep bitcoin on a computer (except if you work at an electronics recycling facility). It's not nearly as convenient as keeping your bitcoin on Coinbase, but you know for a fact that your bitcoin is still safe because you are in complete control.

Define "troll"...because a lot of us who make realistic and reasonable comments get downvoted just because it's not what likes to hear. 
For example, I was downvoted for mentioning that cold storage would have saved a MtGox victim 50% of his life savings. I have no pity for people who don't take responsibility for their actions, and apparently that makes me unpopular. To me, plays the role of overly-sympathetic step-mother far too often. I'd rather see it play the level-headed mother who lets her kid burn themself on the stove, despite the 3-4 warnings she gave them, and then says, "See? I told you it would hurt, now don't do it again. Here's some cold water and a bandaid, now go play outside."

I agree, hacking someone's $5 is the same as stealing someone's $5, which is wrong. This is what you don't seem to understand per your reply [here](
It takes a certain level of absent-mindedness to leave Bitcoin out and about in the way to which you're likening it to dropping a $5 on the ground. You can *not* compare the two, they are not the same, and the same processes do not apply. In order to "leave Bitcoin in the public domain", you have to post a specific piece of information in a public place, akin to giving out your password, which no reasonable person would do. Unless you carry around paper wallets for whatever god-awful reason, you don't just "drop" Bitcoin in a public domain, so in my opinion you can't compare it to dropping a $5. 
I'm not perfect, but if $5 is dropped in front of me, I'll at least try to give it back first, which you believe is foolish and wrong for whatever reason. "If I don't take it, someone else will" is no reason at all to then keep the money...you can take it and give it back, you can take it and donate it (as generously did). 
You used a horrible example to justify your actions and acted like a self-righteous douche on top of it, which is why I've taken issue with your posts. By comparing the theft of a $5 note vs Bitcoin, you might as well compare stealing a car out in public, unlocked, to stealing credit card information at checkout. They simply are not the same and can not be compared...there are different factors in play. The fact that you condone and even seem to encourage stealing someone's money instead of at *least* making an effort to return it is why you should be ashamed of yourself. 
I can respect your stance of "everyone has their own opinions" but this isn't about opinions, this is about doing the right thing, which is something you've made quite clear you have no interest in, given these circumstances.
@_date: 2014-09-30 11:05:37
MtGox was an issue only because people thought it was best practice to keep their Bitcoin on a web wallet, simply for convenience.
This is absolutely NOT best practice, and if it happens again I'll have even less pity for those who lose their entire Bitcoin savings than I did when MtGox happened.
Why? Because those people felt they didn't need to take responsibility when it came to securing their then-uninsurable Bitcoin. This is the wild west of finance...why risk all that money you convert to Bitcoin by letting a 3rd party hold your private keys? It makes no sense from a security standpoint.
There are warnings EVERYWHERE against keeping Bitcoin in a web wallet. There is nothing difficult about using Electrum for short-term storage and using Armory for long-term storage.
We'll see how Circle goes, but if I ever use it you can bet all your Bitcoin that I'm keeping it stored off-site, in a place that only I have access to. I highly recommend that everyone follow suit, unless you like living on the edge, I suppose.

HOWEVER...there have been warnings posted left and right for YEARS that advise people to move their Bitcoin to a secure wallet that THEY control, and not to keep their Bitcoin in exchange wallets...exactly because of what happened at MtGox. The risk is simply too great.
In short, people saw dollar signs and got greedy. Imagine going to a casino and keeping a huge chunk of money in their gaming system, and then getting riled up because they lost it all, except that they lost it all due to one person's direct actions rather than blind luck.

Don't lose faith in cryptocurrencies...you just have to remember that your money's security is 100% in your hands. This means being as careful as you deem necessary, and if that includes moving your bitcoin from a hosted wallet to an offline wallet, then do that. When it comes to an uninsured asset like bitcoin, do NOT risk security for the sake of convenience, because that's exactly what happened to you with MtGox. The system isn't broken...humans are.

Depending on which wallet client you use, the fee can be manually set but is often set by default to 0.0001 or something like that. I believe bitcoin-qt (the basic client wallet) has the setting at the bottom of the application window.

You can use Bitcoin as an alternative to keeping money in the bank. Unlike banks, you might even get something more in return, like how interest used to be a thing but now isn't.

You are wrong. Apart from carelessness, you can't "accidentally" leave Bitcoin laying around.

Assuming makes an ass out of you and me!
Ok sorry, but in all seriousness, having an inherently centralized system is the problem, not how trustworthy the 3rd party is, because at any time that 3rd party *could* seize control and overstep their bounds. 
At any point, greed and other factors can corrupt a centralized system. Bitcoin is inherently protected against individual greed because of its decentralized nature. Insured Bitcoin storage is already possible due to Circle.com, the largest roadblock is getting people to accept that Bitcoin itself can be trusted...and that's a matter of breaking/introducing habits, which nobody likes but would explain why the younger generations have taken to Bitcoin so readily and easily.
Any kind of centralized cryptocurrency is unacceptable and unneeded when a decentralized cryptocurrency is working just fine (with software updates every so often). Granted, Bitcoin may still need some features added for it to be considered truly secure and all that, but it's a lot better than having to convince an overzealous 3rd party that I can, in fact, be trusted to manage all aspects of my financial well-being while on their site and without any interference from said 3rd party.
For me, Bitcoin is fine as-is, but I feel improvements and security/efficiency features that alt-coins implement should be emulated to really round out Bitcoin and show people that it's not as scary as they might think.

The exponential growth in mining difficulty will also drive the ever-decreasing supply to an ever-growing standstill, so the current supply at any given time will be the same supply for longer periods, which is when Bitcoin may finally start to see use as a currency. 
When the supply growth starts to dwindle, the purchasing power has to rise if the market value is to increase, which it undoubtedly will. This means something you buy for 0.3 BTC now could be bought for 0.003 BTC down the road, and that's a low estimate. 
The more money you pour into something, the more each bit of that something must be worth :)

You didn't just leave it lying around, you purposefully left it and expected someone to take it...don't be a sarcastic ass when someone proves they're a better human than you by donating it instead of keeping it like you would.
Accidentally dropping $5 is regrettable, but finding the $5 and keeping it instead of at least trying to find its owner is worse. Always try to return someone's money before keeping it. You are the cruel, greedy, and callous minority here.

Dude, people spend their money on whatever the hell they want...who are YOU to tell them if their purchases are "right" or "wrong", and where's the pedestal you were just standing on which gave you the power to determine if a person is an idiot?
OP is giving us a good perspective on the current situation...it's not about getting the most back out of any investment. Using Bitcoin is about having access to a free, community-driven, mathematically-grounded, and easy-to-integrate digital currency. Money is NOT the most important thing in the world, and while it determines the value of Bitcoin for now, eventually Bitcoin will become its own currency. I agree 100% with OP, though my investment has been much lower than theirs haha...while the ride may be very rocky and while people may give up on Bitcoin, use it as an opportunity to buy more and "hodl" or use it. 
One of the most common misconecptions about Bitcoin is that it's essentially a get-rich-quick service, and day-trading is the way to go...I have no idea where the idea came from, but no. This is a VERY long-term investment, keep in mind that once all 21,000,000 coin is mined, the purchasing power of bitcoin will have risen...deflationary currencies are cool like that.

For only 200 bits, Electrum is the best bet. That and Armory are the only two I use on a regular basis...Electrum for small, spending amounts, and Armory for long-term storage.
Armory may indeed be overkill for 200 bits, but better to get in the habit of using high-security wallets now vs when it's urgent and you have a greater chance of messing something up. When it comes to Bitcoin, I always err on the side of safety, and you will never convince me to do otherwise. It's not like regular money where you have some form of recourse...that is why so many newcomers are turned off by Bitcoin...there's no "Undo" button, and they get scared of doing anything at all except holding, spending it all in one place, or selling it back as soon as they make a $5 profit, then they get bored and think "Wow...so this is Bitcoin...whoop-deedoo..." Either that or they get their Bitcoin stolen and decide it's not for them...and I would agree, Bitcoin is not for the security-unconscious at all. You need to be prepared to suck up a loss, protect your Bitcoin, and buy/sell at the right times to make the most of your investment...day-trading is another beast entirely, don't even get me started on how bad of an idea day-trading Bitcoin is.
Speaking of holding, I have no pity for the victims of MtGox, as warnings against keeping large amounts of Bitcoin on any hot wallet at all were abundant and in plain view. This is why I stress the use of Armory, as it is the most secure and honestly isn't that much of a pain to use. The worst part is opening it after about a month and having to wait about 30 min for it to rescan the Blockchain, but that happens with any wallet (except Electrum). 
Sorry for the essay, haha. Here's 100 bits as thanks for the inspiration!

Kind of an overreaction...was looking at it from a different perspective than you.
may not be sure when Bitcoin will *officially* be out of beta, but that doesn't mean he's a jackass for being technically correct. 
The point I took from his reply was that since Bitcoin is open-source, it's not up to any one entity to decide when it's officially out of beta. Because of that, he's correct...it's all just text on a screen. 
Truth is, nobody that replies here will know when Bitcoin will be out of beta (though we all hope that someone who does, will). You're just asking an age-old question that's getting an age-old reply.

Do what suggested and check out the process of producing vanity addresses. Coincidentally, I make them :)
Basically, the receiver has to generate a key part (KP1) and send it to you in the form of a hash. You then use the [Vanitygen software]( to generate a custom, or simply random, Bitcoin address that has another key part (KP2), that is generated based off of the hash derived from KP1. When you send the Bitcoin address and KP2 to the receiver, they enter KP1 and KP2 into a web tool ([main page]( [Vanity address key part sum test]( and it will give them the private key for the corresponding Bitcoin address. 
The receiver is the only person who has seen KP1, and when you use software to give them KP2, they can generate the private key for their new Bitcoin address.

Make sure you're clicking the green "USD" icon when you're going to send money, it took me a bit to figure out that you can switch between USD and BTC by clicking it.

Because PayPal and banks legally steal your money and lie to you about it, while hackers will flat out tell you they stole your money. Also, try sending money to someone on a holiday...if the bank's closed, you're screwed. The Bitcoin network, however, is always running.
Exchanges going offline and causing users to lose their money is not a flaw with Bitcoin, it is a flaw in those users' security practices. Whoever loses all their Bitcoin from an exchange going offline will get no pity from a good number of the Bitcoin community, because they trusted their Bitcoin to a third party that controlled their private keys, and ended up empty-handed. It's like giving someone your password and having them exploit your trust. It's not the money's fault, it's the exchange's fault, and the user's for giving out the password to their money.

Bubbles don't indicate rampant growth or success either...price just reflects however much people think 1 BTC can buy. True, that's usually based off how well Bitcoin is perceived by the public and how much people think it's worth, but hich price is not always a good thing, in my opinion.

I agree, I'd like to see a more manageable price while we wait for every Bitcoin to be mined, when the price can actually stabilize. Everyone who's losing their mind right now is being pretty silly, considering Bitcoin's completely unpredicatble and volatile nature.
I will say though, if the price holds around $1000, it's a lot easier to use all those decimal places...nobody wants 0.0005BTC if 1BTC = $10 :P

Key lesson to be learned: Bitcoin's price in USD does not reflect its actual value. 
The USD isn't doing so hot lately, so that may be why everyone thinks BTC is tanking, but it's actually doing quite well and making gigantic strides. Microsoft accepts it now, if that's any indicator of its progress since last year when everyone still considered it a scam before actually learning about it.

First thing first...STAY AWAY FROM BUTTERFLY LABS. Its a very sorry excuse for a mining hardware company.
To actually answer your question, 10 GHash/s was significant back in 2013 or so...now, you need THash/s speeds to even see a glimmer of a return from mining. Unless you have multiple thousands of dollars to buy the mining hardware, the electricity to power the hardware and the cooling/AC, and the facility to house it all, not counting other expenses like taxes, employees, etc, you won't see any kind of return. 
I'm sorry to burst your bubble, I too am hoping to mine again...I started when my 600 MHash/s GPU was sufficient to mine an entire Bitcoin. That was back in 2013/2014, and I keep hoping the mining facilities will give it up and the network hashrate will drop to GPU-friendly levels again. Its a long shot, but I can dream, damnit!

Hackers are an ever-present threat while using the Internet...to single out Bitcoin as the main attractor of hackers is foolish and ill-informed...before Bitcoin, did hackers *not* target banks? 
If you store your money in a bank, it's just as susceptible to poor security practices as it would be if it were Bitcoin. I treat my offline wallet like a bank and haven't had anything stolen, and there are countless others like me who actually take their money's security seriously. 
If you're not willing to take responsibility for the security of your own money, Bitcoin is not for you and you should stick with banks. They only operate on business days from 9AM-4PM and will charge you a fee of $30 for being $0.05 overdrawn, but damn it's nice knowing your money is secure and not being gambled with by bankers!

What if OP needs a car to get to work, and public transportation isn't an option? Not trying to shoot your post down, just playing the Devil's advocate. 
My thoughts are these: A car is of far more use to a 15-16 year old than 10BTC is, especially given Bitcoin's unpredictable and volatile nature and overall lack of adoption by central services that play key roles in our lives. I believe Bitcoin will ultimately succeed and if OP was using disposable income to buy the Bitcoin, then by all means OP should go for the Bitcoin AND the car...but I personally don't have enough faith at this point in Bitcoin's growth/progress to spend my entire life savings on it and forgo a crucial form of transportation that provides more independence than reading "10 BTC" on a computer screen does.
Long story short, I would take the car any day, or get both if money allows...but I would never choose BTC over a car if I didn't have either...a car is just too valuable these days, as much of a shame as that is.

Fair enough, do what you feel is best! Everyone's situation is different, and if you're covered in case anything goes wrong, then more power to you :)
Edit: Let me add...you should keep in mind that not everything will always go according to plan. Don't get too far ahead of yourself...work with what you know and base your decision off that. Until you've talked to your parents about using their car to get yourself around (they may have some rules/caveats you may not agree with or that don't agree with your social schedule), and until you're sure you can get that job right off the bat, and you're sure you'll actually be making $800/mo, I'd start to buy in chunks rather than spending the whole $800 in one go, just to be safe. If the price starts rising drastically, buy a bit more than usual and keep that buying trend going. There are a *lot* of "if's" you have yet to solidify, so just play it safe and you can't lose.

Personally, I buy some whenever I have some extra funds and hold it until the price levels out/rises. I only buy during a price fall if I absolutely have to, but I'm pretty generous with my definition of "absolutely have to" :)
Once all 21 million Bitcoin are mined, the price will have a much greater chance of stabilizing. Until then, however, people should be treating their Bitcoin like a highly volatile stock that they can spend at any time. I love riding the price waves, and looking back at purchases made in which I lost money, I have no regrets! 
The technology is what makes Bitcoin valuable, not it's arbitrary price in USD. Use it for its utility and simplicity (assuming you have a decent understanding of how to use a computer), and forget about using Bitcoin to "get rich quick". Best practice is to buy however much you can afford and keep it as secure as you can while using it for whatever you want.

Yea, like the top comment says, Circle.com is your best bet. AFAIK you can only link cards with a billing address, so no AMEX Gift Cards (I tried, no luck). However, you can also link your bank account which is really convenient, if you don't mind giving out your info. Thankfully, my bank is really good about fraudulent charges and unauthorized transactions, so I feel secure enough to have gone that route.
When you log in, if you've already linked a card/account, you'll see your current Circle.com balance in both BTC and USD, along with two buttons (Add Funds, Withdraw Funds). Click the "Add Funds" button and where it says "Amount", click the green "USD" icon and it'll switch to BTC, allowing you specify an amount in BTC rather than USD. It will show the method you'll be using to buy the BTC below, along with the total price. If everything looks good, click "Desposit Money" and the balance you just specified will be instantly added to your Circle.com balance. 
To withdraw Bitcoin to an external address, start over at the main page that shows the two green buttons and find the link above that says "Send Money". Click it, fill in the address you want to send BTC to, click the green "USD" icon to toggle between BTC and USD, include a message if you like, and click "Continue". I believe you're all set, I can't confirm what the next step is because I don't want to withdraw any BTC right now, but it's very straightforward.

While it's fun to keep track of 1 Bitcoin's value in USD for referencial purposes, its price does not determine (or necessarily indicate) success/failure. If you want to speculate on the price, go to that's what it's designed for.

There will always be people at either end of any spectrum, and making a poll to best determine what to do with your money may seem like a good idea...but at the end of the day it's OP's decision, and going with one side or another without taking both sides into account and making the best logical decision is foolish.

Good point. Personally, I don't keep enough in Bitcoin at any one time to ruin my life if I should lose it, and if I do have enough to make a noticeable dent in my finances, it's kept on an Armory paper backup instead of in a live wallet. when I buy, I buy because the price is low or because I have a great reason to, and whatever's left I can watch for the fun of it :)

You keep saying you're serious and not trolling, but this post is grade-A sexist bullshit. Women already use Bitcoin, and I know plenty of men who don't use it.

Please consider this purchase extremely carefully. You should never invest more into Bitcoin than you can afford to lose, and if you're about to invest your entire life savings into Bitcoin, your decision has the potential to go horribly wrong. For that reason alone, I would get the car and wait until you have some form of disposable income before you buy Bitcoin. "Disposable", in the sense that you would otherwise spend that money on movies, food, games, etc...stuff that you could still actually buy with Bitcoin.
I'm all for buying Bitcoin, but please...carefully consider what you're about to do and make sure you're making the absolute best decision you can possibly make at this time. If needed, wait another day or two, even three, and see if you still want to go full-in. It's a great time to buy Bitcoin, but you also don't want to be reliant on your parents to drive you around at 15-16, even IF you do have 10 BTC. That 10 BTC won't give you the sort of independence that a car will, especially when that independence is crucial at your age.
If you can find a service that allows to buy a used car with Bitcoin, make sure you're set to make that transaction once the price rises and you'll win on both fronts. Until then, just think about it. I'd hate to see your Bitcoin purchase turn out to be an ultimately bad decision, that's never fun :/

@_date: 2015-01-14 12:37:04
Nothing anyone here says should determine what you do with your money...that's just a foolish expectation on your part. I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm sorry it comes off that way. If it were me, I would hold. The price will rise again...I can't figure out why everyone is losing their heads. How many times has Bitcoin "died" now, 7? 8? More? If the price stabilizes around $100-$200, then that's where it should be. Bitcoin is highly volatile, and for future reference, please don't invest any more $$$ if you can't afford to lose it.
@_date: 2015-01-07 04:11:35
Bitcoin is not and should be treated as a currency at this time. Once all 21 million Bitcoin is mined, then yes, the price will stabilize and it can be treated as a currency...that's how it's designed - mathematically - to work. For now, think of it as a highly volatile stock that you can spend at any time.
The reason Bitcoin is superior to fiat is because Bitcoin's worth isn't determined by another human being who is highly susceptible to corruption and greed, and who can be manipulated by 4th parties. Bitcoin's worth is determined by its utility and ability to integrate into existing systems in such a way that anyone in the world can access the Bitcoin network, regardless of credit score or employment history, or other arbitrary BS that *other humans* created to filter out the "high risk customers". It removes the need for trusting the security of money to another person, and instead places that responsibility onto each Bitcoin user's shoulders, which is apparently a hard concept to grasp, for some. The blockchain keeps a perfect ledger of every transaction, so while every transaction is publicly viewable, no immediately-recognizable identifying information is revealed, which makes everybody equal off the bat. 
Also, keep in mind that most money is in digital form, usually in an online bank account. When you get your balance, you don't see every dollar you own, they give you a printed receipt of digits on the screen. Bitcoin, in this regard, is no different...except Bitcoin is designed to be fair, and can't be manipulated by government or other greedy entities unless you can fork the blockchain, which is basically impossible at this point. Early on, forking the blockchain meant owning more ASICS than the next guy...but now, you need a warehouse of mining equipment, or three, to make a dent in the blockchain, so manipulation is - again, mathematically - very highly improbable.
It's all about accountability, and Bitcoin's designed for it, while the current financial system is designed to make the rich richer and the poor poorer. Sounds corny, but it's entirely true.
@_date: 2014-01-05 20:02:34
Since it's a public ledger, people can find out anybody's bitcoin balance...I'm not sure why it matters whether or not I care if people find out my entire balance. Also, I forgot to mention that you can actually send whatever bitcoin you have to as many other addresses you like, so you can even have 5 addresses for gas alone if you want, which will make it a lot harder for others to keep track of your financial history! 
I'm sorry if you misunderstood what I was trying to say, I'm just offering an easier way to think of a bitcoin address in terms that generally make sense to beginner users, versus all the jargon you usually see surrounding bitcoin. Correct me at any point if anything I've said so far is factually incorrect, and please back up your argument with why it is incorrect.

No. The price of BTC in USD is not indicative of Bitcoin's success/failure. It's a 2-way street, the USD isn't doing that great and it's purchasing power has gone down, which in turn affects the BTC market, but not adoption or integration.
It doesn't matter how much 1BTC is worth in USD as long as Bitcoin is being implemented and adopted in bigger ways than it ever has been in the past. Stop focusing on money and profits, and instead focus on how the system works. If you believe the price will never rise again, you may not have as solid an understanding of how Bitcoin is designed to work as you should, and as a result, don't have the right perspective to declare 2015 "off to a bad start". 
Sorry to sound so harsh, there's no way to say all that without sounding like an ass :( No ill will intended! It's all a matter of perspective, and since Bitcoin is still highly volatile and very much in its infancy, you have to be able to see a price drop and *not* lose your marbles. See this as an opportunity to buy cheap Bitcoin :)

Thank you for actually telling us the message you're trying to spread.
I'd disagree and say that a low difficulty means that mining won't require an entire warehouse of ASICs, making Bitcoin a less centralized platform than it's become.
Also, why are you only focused on the price of BTC? It seems like you're ignoring the blockchain's potential for utility and social revolution. Bitcoin is just a store of value...I'll take a revamped society that has its shit together over more valuable Bitcoin any day.

If Bitcoin required purchasing anything, I might agree. But as long as you have a cell phone you can use it...I don't think something that's so cheap and simple to use is going to flop. If it does, it'll be because it posed such a large threat to the world's banks that they literally bought laws banning Bitcoin. 
There is no way to stop Bitcoin from being used, and there is more secure, user-friendly softwares are being developed, so there's not really an opportunity for it to flop.
@_date: 2015-04-08 14:01:57
You must be under the impression that Bitcoin's price determines its success...it does not.
Exchanges being hacked is an issue with the overall security of the exchange, not an issue with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin were easily hackable, people wouldn't target the exchanges, they'd target individual addresses.
The opposite of progress, in my mind, is a lack of adoption and a general lack of interest. Bitcoin has grown in both these areas.
Edit: Looks like needs to reevaluate their perspective regarding Bitcoin. Downvoting comments that prove your point invalid is a good way to show people you shouldn't be taken seriously.

The new wallet.NUMBERS.bak file should work if you rename it to "wallet.DAT" and get rid of the new wallet file. Try reinstalling bitcoind and copy/pasting the new file into place, it should start up successfully. 
If you're able to access your funds after following any of the steps people have suggested, IMMEDIATELY export your private key list so you can manually re-add addresses in the future. This will prevent a corrupt wallet.dat file from screwing you over.

Actually, there are cross-coin mining pools that allow you to decide how you cash out. They support altcoins and Bitcoin alike. Is that along the lines of what you were referring to?
I guess my point is, if the difficulty goes down, that will make it easier for more people to mine, resulting in less centralization which is a core aspect of Bitcoin. At this point, I think Bitcoin 2.0 will need to blow us out of the water if it's to succeed the Blockchain in popularity, but regardless I think the Blockchain allows more room for growth and development which is why it's more popular. Bitcoin is essentially a really well done experiment, and I assume that any future iteration of Bitcoin will allow current users to exchange their BTC for the improved version. But you know what happens when we assume :)

You're trying to get new Bitcoin enthusiasts to join your gambling site, without admitting that they will most likely lose all of their Bitcoin. You're disgraceful, especially for targeting newbies. Seriously...shame on you and all you stand for. I don't give a flying fuck if your casino has a pure gold unicorn that'll give me a reach-around for free, and I don't give a fuck if every single one of your games is free to play...back off the newbies and find your helpless victims elsewhere.
Newbies, Bitcoin is not hard to come by, at all. The easiest way is to just sign up at Circle.com (best for Bitcoin enthusiasts in the US) and buy Bitcoin instantly after your bank account has been confirmed. As long as you tell people you accept Bitcoin, enough people will give you Bitcoin for your goods and services that you won't need to gamble away your first few bits on another run-of-the-mill gambling site, just to get a taste of the wonderful world of Bitcoin. Unless you're nothing but a gambler, in which case, get help.
Do not get into Bitcoin by joining a gambling site. 
PLEASE.

But you do not own the private keys, so you don't actually own any Bitcoin kept on their site. Your line of reasoning is exactly why people lost all their money from MtGox...they chose convenience over security.
The insured balances is definitely a plus, but why take the chance? If you lose your money due to some BS at Circle, you have nobody to blame but yourself, given past events. In the event of loss of balance, trying to blame everyone else when you've been warned of the risks of keeping your Bitcoin in a hot wallet is just foolish and does not merit pity, especially considering the simple fact that any Bitcoin in a hot wallet **is not actually yours since you do not have ownership of the private keys.**
Stay secure, and use Armory.
@_date: 2015-04-25 11:47:29
What horror stories have you heard about Circle? I've used them exclusively for the last year or so and haven't had any trouble whatsoever.
Just be sure to use Armory on your computer. When you buy BTC from Circle and they arrive in your Circle wallet, immediately send the BTC to your Armory wallet to avoid any BS on Circle's (or any exchange's) part.

Unless I read it incorrectly, OP stated in their post that they moved "all" their BTC to this exchange after signing up, which is never a good idea. My apologies if you felt I was being unnecessarily rude, but this is exactly what happened with MtGox, and people who were affected had a tendency to shovel every ounce of blame away from themselves, which is wrong and immoral, regardless of what happened. Place blame where blame is due. If you disagree, I'm sorry...you're simply wrong.

Nothing that doesn't apply to Bitcoin as well.

How much of your Bitcoin are you keeping in hot wallets? If it's an amount you can't afford to lose, start using cold storage or another form of storage with which you actually possess the private keys. I hate to assume that you're keeping all your BTC on there, but if so, then you have to take some of the blame. This is pretty much what happened with MtGox, and for whatever reason, people still keep significant amounts of BTC in online wallets, only to see it vanish.
Don't become the next poster child for having your BTC stolen, ALWAYS use offline storage.

How can you possibly question this logic? People are responsible for themselves, businesses aren't there to take over their customer's common sense or sense of responsibility.

See if you can install a 64-bit version of Windows, their website mentions usability issues for anyone not using a 64-bit system in addition to having at least 6GB of RAM...but that may have been posted a while ago so I don't know if that's still pertinent information.

Pat, you need to learn the difference between criticism and hostility. To say I'm not level-headed is an very outlandish remark to make, seeing as I've done nothing but tell you that you and your article are both severely lacking in integrity. If I had threatened you, you'd be within every right possible to claim I was unbalanced (you'd know all about unbalanced, eh?) I have done no such thing, though I can see how you'd make that mistake...I personally kick someone right in the mouth if they so much as utter the beginnings of a counter-argument.
Nothing like slandering new readers to get your reputation to skyrocket, eh?
I never said it had to be a *good* reputation.
EDIT: I wanted to make this point earlier, but if you've already explored Bitcoin by yourself, why are your articles on Bitcoin loaded with more negative adjectives and associations than positive ones? You say you've written about both sides, yet you're looking for a clearer understanding. Don't ever professionally write about something you don't fully understand, Pat. Journalism 101 (maybe...I've never taken journalism though after this, it seems anyone can do it).
That's all I have to say, and I sincerely hope that from here on out you get a complete understanding of a topic before writing about it, Pat. Your career will thank you.

They would be, yes, if Bitcoin were a more wide-spread currency. I agree that if they were to accept Bitcoin they would make a lot of money.

If you're putting money into something, it probably isn't worthless to you. Regardless of how valuable bitcoin is/isn't, people know about it and it's becoming very popular world-wide so I don't see it failing anytime soon.
Please, don't treat bitcoin like it's simply stock. Treat it like a stock you can spend at any point, or better yet, treat it like an alternative bank where you store your funds yourself...not like a paper bill that's printed value magically changes every other day. If you invest $300 and the price goes down to $250, don't abandon all hope. 
Assuming the Earth's population is around 8-9 billion, and assuming every single person on Earth will have exactly 1 BTC...mathematically, by the time all bitcoin is mined, 1BTC today will be worth 0.002 BTC by then, meaning 1 BTC now will be worth AT LEAST $200,000 at the end of the road, just using plain division. Now take into account all the bitcoin that is lost/stolen/never seen again. That $200,000 only goes up.
On the other hand, if bitcoin completely fails, then you'll only have invested as much as you're willing to lose and you'll be no worse off than before bitcoin started.
EDIT: TL;DR: Only invest what you can afford to lose.

In my case I heard of Bitcoin and immediately started mining, learning along the way. I also don't pay for electricity (utilities are included in my apartment), and have kept my computer up-to-date. I'm mining with an HD 7850 @ ~285MH/s and have made ~$18 USD at current market value, at little/no cost to myself. 
I think mining is interesting and probably appeals to programmers and other computer-savvy types, so Bitcoin isn't just another currency to them...they can play a central role in the propagation and distribution of Bitcoin.

There's a cool service called cash to coins or something like that, I'll update with the link in a few minutes. You basically make an ATM cash deposit and send them the receipt with some of your unique account info written on it, and they send you the equivalent in BTC. I haven't used it yet but it might be worth checking out.
Edit: [Cash Into Coins.]( They have pictures of the process and what you should/shouldn't do in terms of putting your CashIntoCoins account info on the ATM deposit receipt. Good luck!

It's a long-term investment, if you want to think of it as a way to make money. I think of Bitcoin as an alternative to banking, not a way to make money, so there isn't really an advantage apart from keeping your money under your own control.

There's a thought...but wouldn't that cause a huge problem for people with notable wallet sizes, if blockchain.info's import feature has a bug that applies a 0.05 transaction fee to any outgoing payments? Wallets would be short by a good amount whenever someone imported their wallet, right?
 
I know I have my client's transaction fee set to 0.01 and I haven't been able to find any forum or other form of support besides FAQ, and even then they mention nothing of import fees.

How often have you gone to another state, bought ANYTHING, and reported it on your taxes months later? Do you even remember WHAT you bought in that other state? I'm arguing that people evade small incomes/expenditures all the time, and aren't penalized for it.
Are you arguing that I am, in fact, paying income tax on BTC that I mine? Somewhere along the road, yea, probably. But there are no outright taxes involved with BTC transactions, because that's how the system works. It's also a world-wide currency so the US government can't impose a tax on the currency itself, or so I'd think( Note: this does not include exchanges or other for-profit services involving BTC. I'm talking about person-to-person transactions.)
I have neither personal NOR professional experience in finance, with minimal personal experience in mining, so I could be talking out my ass. But I like what I said, it sounded nice.
Edit: I just had a thought, that if I'm being paid and the government doesn't recognize BTC as a legitimate currency yet, there is no way to tax BTC transactions, especially if I don't convert BTC to USD or any other currency.

If you've never worked a cash register for a restaurant before, let me tell you with 100% certainty that most eating establishments do not like accepting large bills for exactly the reason gave...you can't do anything with them except empty half your drawer and keep the bill off to the side, to be handled at the end of the shift. 
I guarantee if you checked every bill that passed through that Wendy's near you, you'd find tons of fake $20's, yet barely any fake $100's (if they still accepted them). You might think that doesn't make sense, but if you think about it, that's what everyone else initially thinks, so people are always checking $100's...they never check $20's or $10's. So the smaller bills are more often counterfeited because they are less likely to be checked at a Wendy's cash register.

My point was that you don't *need* to buy a brand new rig...you can use the computer you have at home with possible upgrades (if you need to), and because it's so easy to mine from any computer it makes a fantastic hobby.
Normally I have a few lights on in the apartment because I like bright rooms, so those get turned off. My AC keeps the room cool when I'm sleeping, and when I'm awake I turn off the AC and then open the windows for more air circulation. I'll unplug various electronics if I really want to be sure but usually when I'm mining everything else in the apartment is off/unplugged, so it balances out and sometimes dips below average.

I'm pretty sure I misread your initial post, I was under the impression that the customer got USD for the refund instead of BTC. 
If the customer paid you in BTC, they paid you in BTC...not BTC-that-the-customer-thinks-of-as-USD. You did exactly what you should have done. The customer will have been aware that BTC is a very risky investment, and if they weren't ready for the bad as well as the good, that is not your problem. Refund exactly what you received, and the person has absolutely no reason to be upset. Feel free to refer them to this post of yours if they still feel as though you're an ad-hoc exchange.
EDIT: This is assuming you advertise your service in BTC, not USD. If you advertise a USD price, then you should absolutely send back the BTC equivalent of however much they paid you. If they want one of your services for $20 and send you 0.02 BTC (using $1000/1BTC for example), then the price drops to $500/1BTC, you should send them back 0.04BTC as they essentially paid $20. If you send them back 0.02BTC at a rate or $500/1BTC, they get $10, and you get a complaint.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:52:53
NOTE: I could be wrong, this is just my personal understanding.
'Node' is basically another name for a miner because for each piece of mining hardware you have, you can have that many bitcoin miners working at once, each acting as a node that can receive and transmit block information. For example, if you have a computer with 2 graphics cards in it you can potentially run two miners, meaning you can have two nodes open.
Short answer? Miners are not different from nodes, they are basically one in the same.
EDIT: Cleared up the terminology

That was another thought I had but I tried and retried importing my wallet, each copy a new backup of my wallet, and each time the result was the same.
On a side note, is there any way to delete a blockchain.info wallet/account?
Edit: Sorry, yes, bitcoin-qt still says what it should say. The thing that's wrong is the amount that I sent changed to 0.05 instead of 0.01, so for some reason blockchain.info says I sent more than I did, making my final balance lower than it actually is.
@_date: 2013-12-10 13:27:37
"Faster" doesn't necessarily make it better...more convenient, maybe. Keep in mind bitcoin is constantly being worked on, so speed may not be a problem soon. 
IMO bitcoin &gt; litecoin because it's more popular, it's more widely accepted, and it's made huge progress in the public eye. To non-coiners, Litecoin probably seems like a bigger scam compared to bitcoin. Until the idea of virtual currency is more widely accepted, I think altcoins will stay in the shadows. If they're going to gain serious real-world practicality, it will be soon though, since everyone is becoming more and more familiar with virtual currencies.

You might not want to buy or sell Bitcoins with PayPal, I'm not sure about if you're buying, but at least if you're selling BTC on PayPal the buyer can report the PayPal transaction as fraudulent and have it cancelled after they get the BTC, effectively robbing you.

Yes, but the bitcoin economy is more than just bitcoin's worth, its the community as well. Say half the community (buyers) want to spend bitcoin, while the other half (sellers) are open but not ready to integrate bitcoin. Using a middle man does help get the word out about bitcoin purchasing power, but the goal is for there to be no need for a middle man. To have stores just accept bitcoin instead of wanting it converted to a currency they trust more is where I think the bitcoin community wants the rest of the world to be, sooner rather than later. 
So while using Gyft.com doesn't hurt, it doesn't really help either. If the option to use bitcoin to buy directly from a seller exists, why not take it and strengthen people's faith in bitcoin?

Buy whenever you feel like it. In the end, assuming the global population will be &gt;= 9 billion by the time 21 million BTC are mined, 1 BTC will be worth the same as ~0.002BTC.
Since that's a very very low estimate for the global population about 20-25 years from now, 1 BTC now will only be worth more.
BTC, if used for investing, should be treated as an extremely long-term investment. For profit, buy/sell whenever you think is a good time to do so. Nobody else can tell you what will happen or how low the price should get before you'd be comfortable buying...it's all up to you.

Neteller IS the third party...maybe that's where you're confused. The 3rd party got duped, just as the seller did. The buyer/scammer got everything. You seem oddly invested in making us all look like shitheads for telling OP the honest and harsh truth. The truth is, it sucks, but it happened. OP can not do a thing about it, and that's his own fault. Neteller acted as the money handler, and they advertise instant deposits...that's red flag number one. Stop being so stubborn about this and look at it from every point of view. Neteller got screwed just as OP did...they don't just clear out user accounts and they've been in business for over a decade so they've been doing a good job so far...so why is it just OP? Because OP sent his BTC to a scammer before making sure the payment was secure, and is butthurt about it. NOT TO MENTION that OP works in a shady BTC-selling ring, which is just a red flag manufacturing plant. Dude, OP is not a victim...he's just irresponsible, which is what I've been trying to say. Irresponsible people are risk-magnets, so don't be irresponsible...you're acting like OP had absolutely no choice in how to conduct his own business when he had 100% control over it.

Yes, but making something legal/illegal doesn't necessarily mean there will be follow-through. I've seen more people run red lights in plain view of police officers, and the cops just let it slide. I agree that using BTC to pay for items such as Ferraris would not be in a person's best interest if they planned to not report it haha, however, the way I see BTC is similar to friends paying each other pay for drinks or something...private transactions that the government can not possibly monitor, at least 100% of them. 
Personally, I plan to hold onto my BTC and have a good-sized balance locked in a safe, so I probably shouldn't even be commenting on this thread hahaha. Good points on your part though, I'd tip you if I had the tipping service thing set up!
EDIT: I do realize people use BTC to pay for more expensive items and don't report it, and yes that poses a legal issue, but I feel that it happens more often than people think and so it's become so common that the government doesn't think it's worth it to hunt down every offender...probably only the biggest ones. In any case, the line between legal and illegal is fuzzy, man-made, and prone to revision. Hopefully there will be a solid system developed and implemented that would handle taxation and all that. Maybe there already is...like I said, I have no financial experience besides bills haha.

I'll be very disappointed in you, OP, if you make Neteller foot the bill for your incompetence. If you take one cent from them you're no better than the guy who scammed you. Losing that much money sucks, but your greed + lack of responsibility is going to screw Neteller in more ways than you think, and it isn't even their problem. Take responsibility for your own mistakes.
I hope you've learned a very important lesson about taking care of yourself instead of blaming others when something goes wrong when it is clearly your own fault...though the fact you keep pestering Neteller about it suggests otherwise. 
While getting your money back would be nice, my impression of you is less than pleasant and I for one will never do any kind of transaction with you.

Not necessarily. I just read up on change addresses and that doesn't really seem to be the cause of my troubles. I tipped someone in a forum 0.000015BTC, and my client added a 0.01 transaction fee, making the total output 0.010015 BTC. The exact same transaction (after importing a freshly backed-up wallet) displayed on blockchain.info shows the Sent amount as 0.05203621 BTC. So a change address may explain the strange address that sent the amount from my wallet, but it doesn't explain why the amount of the transaction changed.
My concern is with the discrepancy between my bitcoin-qt wallet and blockchain.info, because blockchain's wallet is clearly not correct and they haven't provided any insight as to any fees they may charge for importing. That's why I wanted to know if there's any way to delete a blockchain.info account/wallet. 
Thank you for informing me about change addresses though, that was helpful and I thank you. I'd tip you but I'd probably lose my whole wallet in the process -.-

Reddit isn't about "rewarding" people for doing basic research and "punishing" those who don't...but even if it was, why would that stop you from being a kind and conscientious veteran Redditor *anyways*? Working within Reddit's process doesn't mean down-voting everything you've already seen...now you're making excuses to feel better about your voting process (or severe lack thereof).
I do understand the annoyance of seeing the same question for the 7th time in 3 days. In fact, I'm quite familiar with that feeling of "THIS WAS JUST ANSWERED YESTERDAY OMG". What *you* don't understand is how to ignore it, or how to even begin to rectify the problem. Instead of trying to single-handedly retain Reddit's intellectual integrity and prowess, put yourself in the poster's shoes...if you asked a question and legitimately didn't know where else to look because you're new to the site, would YOU appreciate having your post down-voted into oblivion, just because people have seen that question before, without so much as a PM explaining why? Or would you appreciate a helping hand, even if it's just one comment, telling you how to efficiently find whatever information you're looking for? People come to Reddit because we're known as a knowledgeable community, but they're driven away because Reddit is like a child genius...lots of brains but barely any social skills.
Keep this in mind: Question posts don't just benefit the person asking the question, they benefit every single person who doesn't know the answer to that question. You don't know how many people besides the OP that might be waiting for the answer.
When you see a post that asks an oft-repeated question, try this: Post a link to the original question and its answer, instead of down-voting it based on your personal feelings.
If you're thinking to yourself "fuck this guy", I totally get it. I'm some random person, and so are you. I can't force you to believe anything, I can't convince you that my way of thinking is more sound...but hopefully I shed some light on how your method appears to a random person, and how it hurts more than helps. Maybe you'll change, maybe you won't, that's on you...but don't ignore this thread just to spite me. Your method of voting is dead wrong and is completely deconstructive. Fix it.

By your way of doing things, anybody new who asks a question that's already been asked in any subreddit is unwelcome and hurting the subreddit. That is wrong. Just because you've seen every post on Reddit doesn't mean the newbie who just joined this week has as well. Use your brain.
If you want Bitcoin to be successful, educate as many newcomers as possible, and they'll spread the word. Don't downvote their valid questions into oblivion just because you've seen the question before. Downvote them for a legitimate offense...it's easy to tell the difference between spam and a real post, you're apparently just too lazy to figure it out for yourself and simply answer the question if it's valid. That way, there's a recent post with a question AND an answer so other newbies with the same question will have a better chance of having that question answered. 
Following my easy 2-step plan, Bitcoin will have more followers and you won't be a douchebag anymore...everybody wins!
Before you get all up in arms, here's my point in fewer words: If the user is asking a valid question, don't downvote it if you've seen it before...answer it so the rest of us who haven't seen that question before will be better off. Also, you're a douchebag.

You can't really single out specific 'coins' as 'dodgy'...they're either bitcoin or they're not, regardless of what they've been used for. Just like the paper dollar, but digital.
That being said, I'll trade you .51 BTC for .75 BTC, less than the 1.6 ratio you're offering. (EDIT: I think..math isn't my strong suit)
EDIT 2: Now that I think about it, here's a fun fact: there's a very very very good chance that any US paper bill you own has been used to buy/use/sell drugs. Also, fun fact  bills are counterfeited more often than large bills, because nobody expects low-denomination bills to be faked.

@_date: 2013-05-23 12:55:20
You're wrong on both counts, and your argument is so vague that you can apply it to anything. **Example: "Mining for gold sucks because if you want to be profitable you'll need specialized equipment and a lot of time. Even then, if to want to make more than a few thousand bucks a day you'll need a lot of start-up money for equipment."** Keep switching out the subjects in that sentence and you can keep making true statements all day.
- No specialized equipment is needed, unless you mean graphics cards. ASIC hardware is definitely useful but not mandatory. With better equipment, less time is needed to see a return. If you're mining with a CPU then yes, it'll take a while, but otherwise you're probably going to do all right.
- If you want to make more than a few mBTC a day, all you need is a decent graphics card ([here's a popular comparison page]( 
TL;DR: Mining is fantastic as a hobby, you'd be a fool to expect high profits from the get-go unless you want to make mining your only source of income, and making more than a few mBTC a day costs as much as a high-grade graphics card.
**Stop thinking of mining as income. Think of it as community service with a tip jar.**
EDIT: It's simply a matter of opinion. Though your statements are crass, the one or two reasons you gave do, or rather, DID hold merit. Not anymore. I'd buff up your knowledge of mining since the release of ASIC hardware before posting such negative opinions and displaying your ignorance for the world to see.
Sorry if I come off as a dick, I just woke up and it's crappy outside. No offense intended!

@_date: 2013-05-20 12:58:24
Don't think of mining BTC as a profitable endeavor...think of it as a hobby.  At the rate that major pools' hash-rates are climbing, mining with GPU's won't really make much sense in a few months (complete guess). 
If you really want to get into mining for profit, consider buying an ASIC miner from BFL (they accept cash) or Avalon (I believe they only take BTC)...though you probably won't get your BFL order for another year haha.
But yea, TL;DR: Mining is better thought-of as a hobby...it isn't profitable unless you're planning on starting out at ~13 THash/s, right now, for free.
@_date: 2013-12-30 04:10:25
There is no physical resource that is backing the dollar. Most people believe that gold backs up the dollar...but there is literally not enough gold on Earth to back every dollar currently in circulation. What really backs the dollar? Imagined numbers...funds that *will* exist, not funds that *do* exist. It's easy to say "I'm probably going to make $1,000,000 next year, so you can safely invest with my bank", but it's pretty difficult to explain what happened if it turns out you don't actually make that 1 mil. This is the major flaw of existing financial systems that bitcoin fixes by ensuring people can only spend what they have.
I have no idea if you can exchange dollars for gold with the Fed, but I'm assuming not because it's a government-owned supply of gold and it's there to "back the dollar", so if they sell any then there's no point to having any in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-21 22:00:26
Yes, it IS a problem, which is why the majority of bitcoin users who *don't* have issues are extremely careful when making transactions with unknown people using sketchy accounts.

To respond to your second point:


You're correct in that people do use separate rigs to mine BTC, even though it is possible to mine effectively with a regular PC. Keep in mind, there is a difference between having the capacity to use 100% of an 850W PSU, and actually using 100% of an 850W PSU. BFL's miners are using 32W at full speed (I just quickly looked that number up, it may have changed). When a mining rig isn't turned on and actively mining, someone is using that power. While that mining rig is on and running, someone else may not be using that power. Miners' computers are no more or less power-hungry than other electronics and computers out there, I'm not sure why people keep turning to power usage as a weakness in BTC mining. 
**OFFENSE:** I really didn't mean any offense...it really is crappy where I'm at, and I really had just woken up. If you re-read my post carefully, I didn't insult you once. I said you were wrong. There's a difference. 
**"FUCK YOU.":** I will not apologize for calling you out on your ignorance and misinformation...seeing as this is a public forum, in the future you may want to develop a sense of personal responsibility when it comes to declaring something good or bad, especially if you're not entirely clear on the subject you're judging. 
**POWER USAGE:** I am running an HD 7950 @ ~700MHash/sec, at 70C-72C. My power bill has not increased because, like any person concerned about power usage, I turn off all my lights and other appliances I don't need running while I'm away, so my electric bill overall is actually slightly *lower* because I keep an eye on it. Also, my roommate is never really home so I have a bit of leeway.
**PROFITABILITY:** Combining open and closed shifts I presently have **at least** 0.01 waiting in payouts, and it's only 12:30PM where I'm at...so no, no bullshit. I am not arguing that mining is profitable with a decent graphics card and that you **will** make at least 0.01 BTC a day. This has been my personal experience and anyone duplicating my methods will hopefully achieve the same numbers. 
**COMPUTER USAGE:** 


Then you said:


The point of using your graphics card to mine is that you use as much of its potential as possible, meaning you shouldn't expect to mine and play games at the same time. As for windows usage being next to impossible, that would probably have something to do with your miner settings or other computer hardware. For example, adding the tag "-f X" (X being any number &gt; 0) limits your frame-rate to the number you enter...mine is at "-f 3" and I'm presently typing this response to you and keeping 2 other tabs open with minimal windows stagger. 
**VAGUE POSTS:** I'm not sure (and apparently neither are you) what you mean by "more than a few mBTC", because according to the dictionary, the amount you earned (6mBTC) **is** more than a few, seeing as "a few" is generally an amount greater than 2 (see: a couple). Before vehemently opposing anything I say, please define exactly what you mean...clearly we're not on the same page and so we shouldn't even be arguing...but alas...
**I also urge anyone reading to point out any points I may have muddled and I'd be happy to clarify them to the best of my ability.**
PS: To clarify my position in relation to you ([AnxietyMan]( I am presently neutral. People don't like being told they are wrong, so I understand why you probably don't like me a whole lot. I also have no idea who you are or what you've been through or even what your computer specs are, so I've tried to be as straightforward, as clear, and as understanding as possible. Sorry for the trouble, hopefully you'll try mining out again and love it!

It's not a matter of useful or not, it's just a matter of degree. By the time we get the Jalapenos, 5GH/s or more will probably be the average hashrate, so it'll be the same as mining now with a graphics card in a PC, but both you and the rest of the BTC community will have upgraded hardware so it'll be a level playing field. 
For the record, I have no professional/personal financial experience outside of paying bills and maintaining income.

If you're looking for how pools actually work, as in the code and formulas and whatnot, then this is not going to help you at all.
For a basic understanding, then this should help a bit.
The concept is this: Many hands make light work.
Some pools operate in shifts, usually with a max of 10 open shifts. As it starts, each shift will slowly reach ~10 million shares (BTC Guild) and you have until it reaches that approximate amount to contribute as many shares as you can. As soon as a shift reaches the limit, it ends and is marked as "Open" while any new shares are directed into a new shift. Any shifts you have contributed shares to will continue to earn a percentage of each block found until they close.
Other pools just take however many shares you've contributed and pay out rewards as blocks are found. 
However you're being compensated, the proof-of-work system simply counts how many shares you have contributed to a single block, multiplies that by however much one share is worth for that block, and pays out the appropriate amount of BTC once the block has been confirmed. 
For a more in-depth description, check out BTC Guild's page on how PPS and PPLNS each work.

I am paying for the currency by mining...I'm not magically generating currency to buy stuff or anything.
All joking aside, your point is moot because I'm using my computer to validate the blockchain, so I'm essentially being paid. As for taxes, I'd assume the tax is included in BTC prices as it is with USD prices. BTC is traded privately, so as long as the person/company and other person/customer agrees on using BTC and following all associated steps needed then the government can't really interfere. 
Am I thinking of the right topic? I might have gotten turned around haha.

@_date: 2013-11-25 01:01:11
One-word answer? No.
Multiple-word answer? Hells no.
Bitcoin still isn't accepted at many major stores, so that $200 you were going to spend on diapers/food may just end up being $200 sitting in a digital/paper wallet. If you have bills to pay or stuff to buy, don't exchange your last USD into a currency that isn't widely accepted. Instead, change any spending money into BTC and use it to buy more trivial products.
@_date: 2013-12-30 03:48:35
I think people are arguing that people won't spend/sell ALL of their BTC. At least I'm not going to, I'm going to hold on to at least 0.5 BTC because when all 21 million are mined, it will be worth so much more than it is now. 
That's just the math behind bitcoin. 21 million bitcoin divided by whatever you think the population of Earth will be when all 21 million are mined, and you now know how much 1 BTC now will be worth then. 
Assuming the population is 9 billion (for the sake of this example), 1 BTC now will be worth ~0.0023 BTC, so even a small amount of money in BTC will be significant down the road, even if the population is higher, and I think while people might not be aware of the exact details, they certainly know BTC will rise in value inevitably.
@_date: 2013-11-23 15:12:18
I mined 1 BTC and then bought 1 BTC, when they were worth around $250 last March/April. I've spent one over the months, and I'm holding on to the other.

You would acquire BTC the same way you would acquire any other currency, exchanges. Or, independently, mining/faucets/cam-whoring.
@_date: 2013-12-13 19:34:12
At the current market rate, not really. But think long-term. 
This is how I enter 'long-term' view: If every single person on earth has 1 bitcoin, assuming the population will be 8 billion (probably will be higher, but this is just an example), when all 21 million are released each person's 1 BTC today will be worth ~0.002 BTC, so you're 0.001 is half of a single person's wealth in bitcoin once all coins are mined. Now take into account the coins that are lost or forgotten about, that value goes up. 
Long term, it's worth it. But for right now, definitely not.

If you can afford it, invest in a newer graphics card. For about a month I used an HD 7850 which got around 300Mhash/s and made, after about a month, 0.15BTC. I just upgraded to an HD 7970 which now gets ~630Mhash/s so after a month I expect around 0.3BTC. It's slow going but if you don't pay for electricity then I'd recommend getting a nice graphics card and it'll be more profitable in the long run.

Why is this important?


If you take 5 min to search this subreddit on how to spend bitcoin, you will find numerous submissions and comments directing readers towards bitcoin-friendly merchants and services. Since you're emotionally unstable at the moment and you're most likely not going to do the work yourself if you haven't already, here are my suggestions:
* [Gyft](

Hey man, it's not a stupid question at all. Possibly redundant, but not stupid :)
To start off, I thought BitMinter's client was solely for BitMinter and could not be configured. If you want to stick with BitMinter, you could probably do a quick Google search and find where to put the URL, but assuming you really want to mine in slush's pool, here are some alternate instructions.
I am also a part of slush's pool and GUIMiner has been working beautifully for me for the entire time I've been mining. It clearly defines what information is needed for each field, and then you just click "Start mining!"...very easy to set up.
Latest Version: 
CGMiner is thought of as more efficient, but it requires some set up: 
[CGMiner Download]( (Try to only download CGMiner from this site)
With CGMiner, the URL goes into a user-generated text file (.bat format, other mining programs use .wallet, .config, etc) that is placed in the directory where the mining application (cgminer.exe) is installed, and then a shortcut from that text file to the desktop is created for easy access. You can rename the .bat file or its shortcut anything you like.
This is the [CGMiner guide]( I used...I'd just include the  bit as well to save yourself a headache.
My .bat is copy/pasted below for reference, feel free to copy/paste my file contents into your own .bat file if you decide to try out CGMiner (Do not copy the quotation marks):
*Keep in mind that your anti-virus will purge cgminer.exe and cgminer-nogpu.exe because they employ virus-like behavior. I have F-Secure and even after adding exceptions to it's AV, it still purged them...so if your AV software lets cgminer.exe slide, then give it a shot.*
NOTE: Not sure what the  does, but this file wouldn't work until I added it ****shrug****.
 on
ECHO "Example cgminer miner startup file (set your own user and password)"
cgminer.exe -o "MINING POOL URL GOES HERE (ex: stratum.bitcoin.cz:3333) (No quotation marks)" -u "COPY/PASTE MINER NAME HERE (no quotation marks)" -p "MINER PASSWORD (no quotation marks)" -d 0 --auto-fan --gpu-engine 1125 --gpu-memclock 975
How computer-savvy are you? If you're just getting into mining I'd highly urge you to stick with GUIMiner until you're more comfortable with mining in general, otherwise CGMiner is pretty nice.

EDIT: I reworded this entire post to be clearer.
1. OP is in complete control of his bitcoins up until he sends the transaction. He agrees to use Neteller with some guy who buys one batch of coins. All good. 
2. Second transaction request, but it seems dodgy. At this point, OP is still totally innocent, even though he has misgivings. 
3. He sends the BTC, knowing full well that he isn't 100% positive about this second transaction. At this point, it is OP's fault, because he himself was not sure about sending the second transaction but he sends it anyway, making only himself responsible for them leaving his wallet. 
5. He has no guarantee that he will receive funds, he only directs the buyer to send the USD to his Neteller account. Neteller's role in this is providing a service that thousands of people use...why do none of them have the same issue? OP got scammed. 
Neteller would have to have some part in the scam because it doesn't make sense to just empty an account for being high risk. The money went somewhere, just not to OP.
I'm willing to bet that after the initial legitimate transaction (most likely used to establish trust, which it obviously did) OP's bitcoin buyer cancelled any USD transfers upon receiving the bitcoin, and Neteller's site simply wasn't quick enough to fix it after OP's account got credited. 
**TL;DR: It sucks, but this is why you DO NOT USE MIDDLE-MEN SERVICES TO BUY/SELL BITCOIN. Seriously...there are warnings against doing exactly what OP had done plastered all over this subreddit, and tons of horror stories from users who are in exactly the same situation.

I don't think people paying with fake $100's is so common that the owner had to make a policy change...if you go back there tell him to be even more thorough in checking the lower denomination bills.

No no, the OP admitted to being skeptical and continuing with the transaction. At that point, it is OP's decision and his responsibility. If he decided to stop after the first transaction, he probably wouldn't be here asking for advice on how to get his money back from a failed bitcoin transaction, which he knew was irreversible in the first place. 
The point of bitcoin is for users to be responsible for their own money. OP was not. It sucks, and I wouldn't wish it to happen to anyone, but it happened, and it IS OP's fault.

Sounds like a good excuse to get your money's worth by spending the BTC and save yourself the trouble and wait of exchanging it into USD. 
Edit: Assuming that's what you're going to do anyways with USD, that is.

Neteller did what they do, and the scammer screwed both OP and Neteller. I really can't put it any plainer. Unless Neteller was in on it, they are a victim as well. As far as anyone knows, some Nigerian dude duped everyone and made off with everything, we just haven't been updated.
Neteller advertises instant deposits, so they must credit accounts with the value of each deposit before the money from the bank is actually received, so it is entirely possible that the scammer called their bank and cancelled the charged he had just made. That's how scammers work.

I view religion as a form of club...if you don't want to join, don't join. If you want to believe what the club proclaims, that's your business. I'm just glad OP can think for himself and wants to help his parents open their minds as well.

It's most likely because you just renewed your card and it may take some time for the credit system to figure it out...credit cards suck. Add a bank account if you have one, it will make your BTC trading life SO much easier. If you don't have one, then just give it some time before trying to add the card again...or try to add another card. If it still pops up with the same error for the two cards, try a different exchange.
FYI, this seems like a credit card issue, not a BTC issue.

If you're looking to maximize income, mining on a PC you regularly use probably isn't the best route to take, I agree. Though for casual mining it works pretty well...though sometimes I do wish I had an entirely separate rig. I'm content for now until my 2 BFL Jalapeno's arrive :)
EDIT: Clarification.
@_date: 2013-12-08 00:53:50
From my point of view as a consumer, it's nice being able to open a program and see how much money I have, and then find a place that accepts it, send them the exact amount, and just wait for whatever I bought to arrive. There are fewer steps, fewer chances for the amount to be manipulated, and payment is almost instant. It's like cash, but digital, and banks can't interfere 'at their discretion'. 
As a consumer, I wonder why people wouldn't want that haha.

Think of it this way...there will only be 21 million released. If you buy one BTC now, at ~$320, it'll be worth more than $1,000,000 by the time all 21million bitcoins are mined. It is a long-term investment, it is a casual spending currency...nobody can tell you what 1 BTC is worth to you, but I think $1,000,000 is a good place to start.

I think altcoins offer a glimpse into what bitcoin is capable of, and I think that bitcoin will adopt many existing (and soon to come) altcoins' distinguishing and popular features. Altcoins may take away from the bitcoin market, but that's very short-sighted thinking, at least from a financial standpoint.
I do hope bitcoin is the one that wins out, but I think alt coins have their uses. It seems as though you "hate" them just because they aren't bitcoin, which is why I asked.
Edit: I never got Namecoin to work, any idea how it's coming along? What is it used for?

I just got home from work with ~0.02 BTC (confirmed+unconfirmed) waiting for me, if I had a full day it would be ~0.03. At ~630MHash/s, I figure ten full 24-hour days worth of mining per month will give me about 0.3 BTC. Even it it goes down, I'll still be making money and helping the blockchain move along. Personally, I'll be receiving 2 Jalapenos when they start shipping, and I might expand my current PC into a mining rig. I hope to be fine!
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:36:39

My point was, if they had no idea what had happened until you brought it to their attention, then there isn't a whole lot that can be done for you. Hopefully you get your money back, but if you don't, you now know better than to use Neteller again.

After using all the wallets on bitcoin.org, here is my experience:
- bitcoin-qt is my favorite in terms of usability, but it uses a ton of memory (~180k) after a while...not sure if it starts up using that much but it certainly ends up using it.
- MultiBit (0.5.9) is what I'm using now, and it seems to be missing some options that bitcoin-qt had, but out of bitcoin-qt, MultiBit, and Electrum, I've found that MultiBit uses a fraction of the memory that the other two wallets use, which is my main reason for using it.
- Electrum seemed like a nice simple wallet, but I barely used it. I might give it a shot, but as for now I'm sticking with MultiBit for casual transactions, and bitcoin-qt for my personal, PC-based wallet where my savings will go.
EDIT: If anyone is curious, bitcoin-qt starts off at ~50k memory, jumps to 100k, then slowly crawls its way to higher memory usage.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:16:33
So you get currency with real-world value, and in exchange you give currency with no real-world value? That's like paying BTC to play with Monopoly money...unless I missed something?
"Give me 0.001 BTC and I'll give you $1,000,000,000, in my own private currency"...am I doing it right?

Hey kong_bong, welcome to the community! 
In short, if you don't have the hardware needed to make a profit with mining, simply ask to be paid in BTC for services you offer, or ask for money for holidays and exchange that into BTC. You can also find people that are close to you using localbitcoins.com or maybe craigslist...not sure how CL feels about Bitcoin yet.
Think of BTC as an alternative to USD (or whatever currency you use), so you can exchange back and forth between the two. What I do is take a portion of my monthly income and exchange it into BTC, so I can keep using BTC for spending.

It sounds like you tried to take a road that hadn't been traveled yet, got hurt, and blamed the mountain that the road had yet to be established on. You could have paid with any other accepted form of currency and been on your way, but due to your own decision you failed. That's your fault, not anyone else's. It isn't Spotify's fault they don't accept BTC...it's yours for thinking that they should and then failing to do so via workarounds.

The power it takes to mine bitcoin isn't zero, surely that counts towards bitcoin's intrinsic value. Also, since the process of creating bitcoin is highly community-focused, it could be said that the community is part of the production line, meaning bitcoin users ultimately determine how much it's worth. All that, plus the 21 million BTC limit programmed into the source code.

On a side-note related to bitcoin withdrawals, I bought 1 BTC after waiting 4 days for Dwolla to complete my bank transfer. Now CampBX is telling me I have to wait 31 days till I can withdraw my 1 BTC...is that normal? I know they just updated their policy but I bought the BTC before they made the change, so I shouldn't have been affected. Then again, this is my first CampBX account so maybe there's a prohibition period...

I hadn't heard of Zerocoin, I'll have to read up on it. I'm wondering if it is at all possible for Bitcoin users to retain their anonymity while still having access to 'futuristic' services and products, or if a middle ground can be reached without users having to transfer their funds into yet another currency. Maybe Bitcoin developers could implement zero-knowledge proof!
@_date: 2013-12-16 18:01:16
With each major bitcoin client upgrade they could include a new version of the blockchain (dunno if it's possible/practical?) that would prevent users of outdated clients from forking it, correct?

Yes, they're free to do so, but it doesn't change the fact that only 21 million BTC will be distributed.
EDIT: I agree with your conclusion, though I don't think it's an honor-based system. Maybe it's a matter of opinion...you could alter any code but if you're the only one, or if you don't have a significant enough following using it, there's not really a point apart from "yay, I did it!"

Hell, if I were you I'd just start offering your services locally (if you have any you can market) and casually mention that you accept bitcoin. The more people you communicate this to, the better chance they'll check out bitcoin and you may get an investor out of it. That way, you only lose whatever you put into it if everything falls apart for whatever reason.
