I don't think it's even fair to call it Tahoe.

This whole useless thread is people begging for tips. What a joke this subreddit has become. Is there another that focuses on the news and doesn't let shit like this filter through?

In Norway, I've bought several items from coinsfortech.com. Of course, toll _may_ apply.

That's too bad... I've been satisfied with the service for over a year now, however I haven't had to contact service.

Back in the early days, I spent 2.5 btc on coffee. Totally worth the ten cups or so I got out of it.

Did you try "hunter2"?

I used this during my vacation this year until I left it somewhere. I really liked it and everyone else liked the smell and best of all I wasn't burned after a river tubing trip like usual. Don't want to order more just yet though, maybe I'll replace it next year.

Weeeird, I can't get it any way I work at it.

True that. Still out "just two" btc from bitjack21. It was gambling but with absolutely zero chance of getting anything back, even if you win. I deserved it I know.

My most recent purchase was through your store with BTC. It's actually the second time.

I don't know about banking/atm industry standard agreements here, but I know that in the industry I work in if you elect to not pay for support then get it later, they charge back amounts to cover what would have been covered in years past. Their reasoning is that why would anyone want to pay for support when you could wait until you have a big problem and just sign up today, get support and then cancel at the end of the next period?

"Site Under Construction"

I had the same problem when I was looking for a certain item that I could buy with bitcoin. The only place that seemed to have it was this site, so I took a chance and ordered something in the neighborhood of 4 BTC. I think the items are fulfilled from HK.
It was posted fedex to Norway and I just picked it up yesterday. The customer service guy even followed up to make sure that it made it and even apologized for how long it took (it didn't take long in my opinion).
So I'm playing with my new gadget now and happy to help build the web of trust that bitcoin needs.

Does it make a difference? I wired money from a Norwegian account to Japan and didn't have to give ID or anything. Is it the size of the transfer that is the problem or what?
