If it came from an exchange, that person is fucked. If it came from a private wallet you could send it back.

To be fair, a Crypto transaction is irreversible but you can do a chargeback on a credit card.
I personally agree with banks and credit card companies banned the use of **credit** cards because of this. But banks that don't allow you to use your own money or **debit** cars are idiots looking to lose business.

I've stopped looking at news sites for niche topics because of Reddit. Hell, I don't read reviews anymore because there's bound to be an oddly specific subreddit for whatever you're looking for. Looking at you @_date: 2018-01-28 05:12:49
You don't *have* to store BTC on a node. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:42:16
Even better, you can just use the BIP39 number for the word instead of the word. Saving space and you can buy a cheaper set of punches.

I honestly don't understand why some people are bashing Lightning for being centralized. The nature of a mesh network means it can't be a centralized system.
If a big node starts raising fees, so what? Lightning routes your transaction through the cheapest total path.
If a big node goes offline, so what? Lightning routes your transaction through different nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:21:03
Ok? Make a connection going around the hubs. That's kinda the beauty of the system, if a big node is being a dick and charging high fees your transaction gets routed around them.

I was not expecting the sentence to end like that.
Caught me off guard while drinking and sprayed my monitor.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:34:48
So how does it work? Job poster pays you, you pay bidder? I see there are no fees right now, but how will you enforce something like that? What's to prevent a poster from finding a bidder using your site, then taking you out of the equation once it's time to pay?
I think this is a great idea, hope more employers join up.

I think you'd have to set it in the command to create the Docker container:
    docker run --rm --name lightning --network container:bitcoind_mainnet -v /scratch/bitcoin/mainnet/bitcoind:/root/.bitcoin -v /scratch/bitcoin/mainnet/clightning:/root/.lightning --entrypoint /usr/bin/lightningd cdecker/lightningd:master --network=bitcoin --log-level=debug --alias=[YOUR NAME HERE] --rgb=[YOUR COLOR HERE]
At least for me, it makes more sense running an Ubuntu VM and just installing C Lightning since it gives you more options in the end.
@_date: 2018-01-28 05:11:49
I sunk some money into BTC a little while back, but all this Lightning talk has got me genuinely excited to the point where I'm spinning up a full node on a VM and playing around with C Lightning. Genuinely excited to see where we go next (besides the moon)

I've basically been using them to buy bitcoin and immediately transfer to my Ledger, just waiting on Gemini verification to make the switch completely.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:06:04
I'd love to make the switch, but I've been waiting for verification for nearly a month. For now, I buy on Coinbase but transfer off to a hardware wallet as soon as the funds are available.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:09:49
For the end user, segwit and legacy are identical. The only difference being segwit transactions (any transaction originating from a segwit address) are smaller, meaning less total fees.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:09:03
They've fucked everyone I know that's done business with them. See if a credit union will take you up on it, they're usually more open to "new" things.
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:58:56
I transfer to GDAX before pulling to an external wallet. I usually buy on Coinbase so I lock in that price, rather than keep FIAT sitting on GDAX and organizing buy orders
@_date: 2018-01-04 03:26:18
At 21 I've written one cheque which was immediately cashed using a phone app by my dad. Direct transfer limit of $1,000 vs single cheque limit of $5,000 and I was paying him for a $3,000 computer.
(Bought on his card for reward points)
@_date: 2018-01-28 21:32:16
This. The intent of lightning is to provide a Visa like service to Bitcoin, whereas an on-chain transaction could be seen as writing a cheque.
@_date: 2018-01-27 21:32:20
It's the sum of every node involved that needs to be able to support the transaction. If I wanted to send a full Bitcoin to someone over Lightning I could send it through one channel with a 1BTC volume, or over 10 channels with a .1BTC volume, or 1000 channels with .001 volume. Obviously, the 1BTC channel will have less hops, but if they're charging .01BTC in fees per transaction and the 1000 channels are charging 100 Sat fees, it's cheaper to send it through 1000 channels.

I was a miner on NiceHash and I'm out ~$50. There are threads on the subreddit about miners being out thousands because they had a wallet with them to get lower fees.

So how do you all pronounce it? Same as Hold? Or Hod-el?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:26:58
I like it, it looks like a flash drive to anyone who doesn't know about them
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:02:10
~$50 here, payout in a week. RIP

Bought more at $16.6k, pissed that Coinbase wouldn't let me buy at $15.5k. Woke up to the $13.6k dip.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:26:21
I forgot about this when I did the transfer, only ~$12 lost so no big deal.

Bitstamp took 4 weeks

Willing to bet your penis on that?

Too bad he didn't pronounce it.

I didn't realize I needed to scroll down. Then lost it.

Doesn't matter how many confirmations the exchange requires. If you've got the hash rate you could mine beside the main chain until it's confirmed spent and then broadcast.
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:15:31
Bitstamp is pretty good.
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:16:26
I love how people cry free speech whenever a *company or person* bans/blocks/mutes them. Right to free speech only protects you from government censorship, everyone else can tell you to fuck off.
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:14:40
I recommend getting a Ledger to use as a savings account, and keep a few hundred USD worth on your payment app of choice.
@_date: 2018-04-23 16:09:15
I'm on bitstamp and have heard (mostly) good things. Bittrex is good for other Alt trading but doesn't take FIAT deposits.
