Me. Because Bitcoin was created for this case.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:47:35
Mine IOTA via mineiota.com.

BCH is scam!

LTC on Gox soon!
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:21:58
You are mining XMR on this site. But your reward isin IOTA. I use this service by myself
@_date: 2018-10-19 09:39:45
Use the core wallet so you can learn the most about bitcoin. With the core wallet you are a real part of the network, you are a node and you can decide where you store your private key!
@_date: 2018-10-15 09:54:45
Download the blockchain (it will take some times), generate an address (you can do it while blockchain is downloading), post it here and hope you get some donations.
@_date: 2018-10-22 08:45:55
BTC on 10k in 7 ns!
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:35:09
IOTA will solve this issue.
@_date: 2018-06-08 08:08:33
Alright, lets do this!
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:55:49
IOTA works with a DAG instead of a blockchain. You do not pay any fees for transaction (i made a transaction with the smallest entity of IOTA without paying a fee) so you do not need any miner. As more people use iota it gets safier and faster.

Every existing private key and every private key that will exist stucks in the number pi!
Every picture you have taken and every picture you will take stucks in the number pi!
Everithing stucks in pi!
@_date: 2018-06-06 19:43:47
Me ordered two
@_date: 2018-06-11 12:06:10
Load the IOTA wallet, maybe for iOS, Android or Windows, send me your address and I will send you some.

Mined FTC back then too and there were days, where I made 5€ in profit per day. It was a great time. I told everyone about Bitcoin but no one bought some. Now they regret it.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:26:08
It was a great time back then and I always had a bad conscience running my PC the whole day in Germany at a bad power price :)
@_date: 2019-04-12 10:04:18
Never store coins on an exchange. That is my help.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:23:45
I still have fun mining IOTAs via Monero.
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:43:30
The second one. mineiota.com

I can recommend gameristo form bitcointalk. I did some trades with him too. He is a nice guy.
In general I can recommend the bitcointalk forum for such trades.
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:10:55
nope :) I still own every single coin
@_date: 2019-01-23 12:09:07
Ups ;)
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:46:30
very diplomatic :)
@_date: 2018-03-16 05:38:03
This was irony.
@_date: 2018-03-17 11:08:27
I want to build a lightning node on a raspi to spread the idea of Bitcoin and to kick these BCH kiddies in their tiny ass!
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:24:19
BCH is scam!
@_date: 2018-11-25 23:03:59
Then the miner will only get the transaction fee and Bitcoin is still alive? What else should happen?
@_date: 2018-11-19 11:16:41
Cooy your address where your coins are laying and see how much you could get.
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:20:27
Slush still exists?
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:29:47
Fuck this BCH shit and it „ We are the real Bitcoin. Our transaction are cheaper than the transaction of Bitcoin. We can handle 56  transaction/seconds. This is almost the capacity of VISA. Almost!“
@_date: 2018-03-22 05:00:52
BCH is scam
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:32:19
The miner can choose which transactions he wants to confirm. At first he inserts his own address for the block reward. So every miner has to calculate a different hash because of the different reward address. If the miner calculates the right hash for the block he broadcasts the block to the network abd transactions in the block are confirmed.
If you look closer in a block the first address is always the address for the block reward.
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:15:41
Yes why not. At the beginning it was possible to mine BTCs woth yor COU by yourself. At was usual to transfer thousand of BTCs in one transaction. Back in 2011 I mined some BTCs with my HD5850.
This is the TXID of the pizza which was bought in 2010. Just look at his address and see which values he transmitted.
@_date: 2018-07-12 16:52:50
2€. I mined some with my HD5850
@_date: 2018-07-16 19:51:44
If you do the work do you want split the reward. It is the nature of BTC. The competitive system saves the network.
@_date: 2018-07-27 12:38:56
Why do you have to pay taxes for a gift?
@_date: 2018-07-27 21:26:43
Glad I broke up with them one year ago.
Had a great time on polo and in the troll box!
@_date: 2018-07-18 07:24:20
Sounds serious. Bitcoin withdraw, betting site. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-07-16 20:07:21
No. Everyone do a different work. Everyone has another reward address. You can compare the hash of a block with your personal sign.
So you could participate with your own miner. Would you split your reward if you get 12.5 BTC?
@_date: 2018-12-14 06:25:16
my 20 € investment in 2011.
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:07:22
