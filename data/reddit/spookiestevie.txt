You are the type of person to think if the government banned speech or language, we'd all never speak to each other.

@_date: 2019-06-23 22:40:10
 I made a simple realtime page for mempool size and fee estimations.  
You  can get a good idea of how long it will take a transaction to get 1  conf with a combination of the current sat/byte fee rate and the number  of transactions in the mempool.  
Sometimes I like to spend time  optimising my transaction fees to best suit my time preference as well  as the fact that I don't have much bitcoin to throw at miners (sorry not  sorry). ��

You don't have to be the most technical person to start a node but it does require some basic linux knowledge.

Hi, My Raspberry pi b+ is connected via Ethernet for me to ssh into. I can do this successfully however when I try to do a  sudo apt-get upgrade, the putty connection dies. You can see a more detailed view of the problem in the gyazo. &gt;&gt;
Any kind of help would be awesome

You can make a few satoshis here and there by routing payments but i personally find the 'empowering the network' narrative more rewarding :). It's pretty awesome watching the logs of your node syncing blocks, transactions and payment channels in real time. I would recommend you setting up your pi using this guide if its not doing anything - [

Na, i only put about 60 usd, the autopilot creates payment channels automatically so it just happens to be that it created channels with nodes with higher capacity so more in total can be transacted. 10$ is a perfectly reasonable amount to put into it :)
