Pop quiz: what do [Goto Fail]( [Heartbleed]( and [Shellshock]( have in common?
They are all serious bugs in open source security software.
You can't just say that because anyone *can* review the code, anyone *will*. OpenSSL and heartbleed is a perfect example of how complex and relatively low level cryptographic code is hard to review, and as an open source project there is no sense of urgency or responsibility to do so until it's already gone tits up. Is open source better than closed source for reasons of code review? Of course. Will it stop backdoors? No, absolutely not. Whether intentional (you're asking volunteers to use their free time to review code changes, after all - it's not infesible for them to miss an obfuscated backdoor inserted into a bug fix or code refactor) or not isn't my argument, just that the extra visibility is not being used well enough by the community.

What if a coder submits code that gets approved, but has a bug in it? That's what happened with the three known issues I listed. What if they knew the bug existed, and put it in maliciously?
