I agree. I've been in the market for two years, my grandfather tried to get me into bitcoin in 2011 but i wouldn't listen, i thought it was a ponzi scheme. Now, i'm trying to make do with what i can. I just joined the Reddit community because i have no friends in crypto haha. I read others' opinions for so long but was never able to reciprocate so here i am.

FAKE NEWS!***

Well i'm new to Reddit but not to the market. No need to shame me. That's just my personal opinion. Too much negativity surrounding crypto in the public eye. Will that change over time, I believe it will, however not now. Nintendo stock amassed over 9 billion dollars in net worth because people thought that they created PokemonGo. To me, alot of the public is too heavily persuaded easily by the news (hence my pokemonGo reference), and with bad news regarding crypto lately i dont see any huge runs in the near future due to lack of public investment. Crypto is still just for 'techy' people like us and young guns wishing to become millionaires overnight and we continually see people losing their money which reflects poorly on the crypto community and in my opinion is holding it back. Not to mention that uncle sam is inevitably going to take his cut from all of this eventually and that will nearly destroy the market.
