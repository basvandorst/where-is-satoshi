Works for me, Chrome Windows.

If I recall correctly and someone correct me if I am wrong, I believe is something along the line of a cloud blockchain. So instead of downloading the whole blockchain to your drive you can access it through a Electrum server.

Man, that really put a smile on my face. I love how people are already talking about people living on a different plant in such a way.

Wouldn't increasing the number of Bitcoins significantly devalue the currency? Especially 50 or so years in the future?
@_date: 2015-05-02 19:35:27
The close up got me good.

Best thing you can do is host your own server and run OpenVPN on it.

I'm not completely 100% on how the Great Firewall works, but I am  guessing they block access to known VPN providers and/or ports used to access VPN services.
He could just host the server in another country provided that seller is not assigning him an IP that is already banned and use a different port.

Chill out, bud. I did not say I was against Bitcoin.

If I were to convert $10000 using BTC-e it would cost about $50 then TX fees and then another conversion.  So at minimum $100.

This is it. If you don't have a withdrawal address set, you cannot withdraw. And you cannot set your withdrawal address without contacting them. A nice but inconvenient security feature.

I was going to suggest install a Linux server distro but nevermind.
@_date: 2015-07-10 04:45:16
That was weird. I even used the search and it did not show up.  Works now.

I was having a similar problem with another BitcoinWisdom related extension. This one would just show a little ticker where all the extension icons were. 
I was trying to withdraw LTC from my CaVirtex account but it kept changing to undefined. Disabling the extension fixed it. I'm not 100% sure it was malicious but it shouldn't have been interacting with the website in the first place.
The extension has been removed from the Chrome Webstore but I don't know when that happened. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:39:15
I use QuadrigaCX for CAD/XBT and CaVirtex for LTC/XBT.

Both of which are illegal and should be illegal.

Looks like one of those signs you'd see at the kiosks in the mall that sell Chinese phone cases and calling cards.

You realize you are spending your own tax dollars doing that, yeah? And that the pencil pusher who receives that fax will put it right in the recycling bin?

From the other thread regarding this:


You are not helping our cause by doing this. Just wasting money, paper and time.

Who trusts anything hosted on appspot?
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:11:18
Someone's gonna get a visit from a few three letter agencies. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 16:12:47
I meant using an appspot domain. Especially for a service that is making money off fees.
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:19:56
But that's not the point.

This guy doesn't realize that Apple Pay is not a competitor to Bitcoin. Apple Pay is to Visa/Master Card as Coinkite is to Bitcoin.
