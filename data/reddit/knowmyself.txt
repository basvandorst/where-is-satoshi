it kinda is a “famous debt clock” only because everyone assumes that’s what it is.
but it’s just a clock.

the fact is this: your post says blockchain gives it all back. that’s a stupid lie. no more facts are necessary. it is demonstrably untrue. it’s an immature, piece of childish propaganda. seriously, take it to circlejerk

thats what i get for trying to warn you little shits. you deserve to be poor and hopeless. clamoring for instant wealth, pretending to save the world. pathetic.

The ratio on this post confirms that the people of this sub are highly uninformed and I say this kindly, beware of what you read here.

If you’ve ever read about the CIA or NSA, or have followed politics in the US over the past few years, you know this is categorically untrue.
Bitcoin is used by governments and black markets in support of shadow ops and crimes, all of which have some negative impact on freedom.
Bitcoin is not insured. Can be stolen, can disappear.
The FBI has used blockchain analysis to secure criminal indictments in the Russia probe, and thats not the only instance.

what the hell does centralization have to do with it?
is a decentralized asset an interesting concept worth pursuing? sure.
does it protect you from the government?
not necessarily.
can it be used by the government to prop up efforts that result in fewer freedoms? i see some evidence.
is it private? no.
this subreddit is a teenage cult

it shouldn’t be too hard to realize you are brainwashed when you are trashing the wisdom of a nobel laureate. that quote was a joke he made and it gets passed around crypto subs daily as proof he’s an idiot. he’s actually a decent, smart guy,

Also, the problem with Bitcoin communities is that they have that instagram self help mentality  where they clip quotes from famous thinkers and allow themselves to feel like they’ve got it all figured out. I am certain if Friedman were alive, he and Krugman would be lock step in their opinions on Bitcoin. I have a graduate degree in Economics and have listened to all of these crusty old white guys for thousands of hours, I feel pretty confident in that assertion.
@_date: 2019-01-01 06:45:18
what he asserts without evidence i may protest without evidence. alerting scrollers to the existence of a counterfactual is enough. they can do their own homework.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:38:32
The video and the invocation of Friedman are useless. A million people have said what he’s said. It’s not particularly insightful or meaningful to Bitcoin. Friedman was a great economist but his legacy is a cult of libertarian dogma and the Chicago School of Economics which has proven useful only in extending the reach of the state. Debate if you’d like the merits of liberty, but much of the policy developed by Friedman and Chicago School acolytes has decreased liberty in America.

no. i dont see it going up. i think the economy is preparing for a dip. and if it does go up, oh well, i’ll just buy more then. whats the ceiling? whats the floor? not buying during a downward trend, seems like a poor choice

everyone is so caught up bashing identity politics and feminism but isnt it true that bitcoin is marketed as a democratizing force even tho it is actually more concentrated into the hands of a few than fiat, more manipulated, and yea, what’s wrong with asking about the consequence of it being primarily owned by men?
the only way that’s not a problem, insofar as i see it, is if bitcoin remains a pet project.
at some point we gotta make good on the democratization promise.
if the only people to ever use it, or if the people who always control it, are risk takers, it wont be a success. gender would be an important variable here in evaluating it’s effects and viability.

semantically speaking, it wouldn’t be totally improper to call a donation to a charity an investment.
i can sense the judgement being deployed by the person who made the comment, which outside of any context makes the commenter seem like an asshole.
but to pillory the idea of charity, in this sub of all places, reveals nothing but lust for returns a.k.a. greed.
if everyone who experienced some moonage donated to charity, bitcoins reputation would improve from where it currently stands: as a pet project of white guys and criminals.

jordan peterson is kind of a hack and this is meaningless as far as bitcoins future is concerned. in fact, controversial political figures attaching themselves to bitcoin could have negative effects on public perception.

Can someone tell me, how long can the price of Bitcoin stay below the cost of mining before a comeback becomes practically impossible?

accuse others of disinformation, claim to be a skeptic, list questionable metrics of his success (mostly related to the politics you claim not not be interested in). call him a giant in the field (lol who in the field of psychology views JBP as a giant). fine shilling. JBP is a grifter and it becomes more obvious everyday. Not sure how repackaging Joseph Campbell and telling young dudes to clean their room makes him a giant. Sure, I bet it’s useful to some people, but JBPs pick yourself up and take some responsibility shtick comes packaged with so much disinformation about all sorts of literature and schools of thought. He’s just another one of those guys that does quotes and idioms that helps younger guys feel like they can speak confidently on the source material. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:15:45
maybe you just enjoy some of his awful ideas and ramblings and so are failing to see what a grifter he is.
@_date: 2018-12-31 18:47:04
this is a weird comment. you say you are not a huge peterson fan and add that you find his academic work more interesting, but everything you mention kinda has to do with his politics.
his citations and h-index are not a proper representation being that he’s so famous. his teaching prize at harvard especially, is related inextricably to his politics. 
especially in a field like psychology, which has tremendous roots in pseudo-science and still has not completely separated itself from the label, you are going to have people like jordan peterson make an impact with bullshit. it may produce something, if only for the controversy, but acting like there’s no pseudoscience in psychology makes me wonder if you are just shilling for the guy.
also- the big five. you are seriously doing casual onlookers a disservice with that whole lil diddy of a sentence there. it’s just wrong. but there’s too much to unpack as to why. i’m not familiar with petersons overhauling of the b5 test that represents a new paradigm in psychological evaluation. enlighten me.
the whole thing seems like a jordan peterson copypasta.
