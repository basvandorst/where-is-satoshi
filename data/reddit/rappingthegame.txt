I appreciate it. I’ve looked a bit through bitcoin.org and it seems another area one should be aware of is the upload limits with their service provider. Would I be correct in that? How much upload / download capacity does one need?

Does running a full node also mean you are mining? Or can I run a full node to just help verify transactions and not raise my electricity bill exponentially? Thanks for your time. 
P. S. What is the technical difficulty skill level involved? I’m beginning to become interested in computer science and think it would be cool if my first ever step was running a full node. 
Thanks all!

From my understanding they have a cheap 10 year energy agreement with the city where their main operations are. An attractively priced energy supply with a stable gov’t is a positive. Winter is coming to the cold regions they operate providing a large relief in the cooling they must do compared to operating during the summer months. 
I assume they are strategically using this opportunity to write off depreciation during the bear market in the hopes that when BTC price turns upwards they can use said write offs to pay less taxes during a bull period and have really impressive quarterly filings. 
I am curious of their implementation with the new Bitfury Clarke model that was recently released. They have a turn key solution agreement with bitfury, their majority shareholder. Wondering if there will be news released in the short term about implementing these latest chips. 
We recently saw the first downward adjustment in the difficulty of mining which I’m sure the company was relieved to see. Assuming smaller scale miners are running out of the ability to sustain their mining in this bear market we could see further downward adjustments, benefitting HUT because they can afford to remain mining during extended bear markets due to their industrial scale. 
Overall they seem to be highly competitive in the mining space and as long as they don’t begin dipping into their previously mined bitcoin reserves I am bullish on them. They have a strong team and board who would certainly have calculated the ability to survive during an extended bear market and position themselves to thrive once the market reverses. Winter temperatures/downward mining difficulty adjustments/institutional product releases in the space (price)/deployment of Bitfury Clarke* I see as the short term main factors. 
I enjoy following this company and am intrigued to see how they position themselves moving forward in the space and region.

You can buy less than one bitcoin. Not many people will be able to buy a whole coin but if you judge it is wise to have some then you can still purchase what you can afford. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 13:28:01
Could the depreciation spike be because their chip provider introduced their new line of asic chips rendering the current ones used by HUT far less valuable. Perhaps they are about to replace with the Bitfury Clarke thus the old chips depreciated suddenly.

I also believe you’re not supposed to withdraw the full amount at once. There is more work to do when withdrawing coins after the anonymity set is above 100. 
I am still learning how to withdraw privately. Anonymity set above 100 does not mean coins can’t be tracked anymore because if someone wanted to look at all the single (either inputs or outputs and link them with the particular coin join that is possible). Forgive my sub par technical writing.

People view it as a decentralized technology breakthrough, which it is but that’s not where its core value comes from. The core value of bitcoin is that it can’t be inflated, inflation is the silent tax and theft of our money aka our time and energy. 
Bitcoin is mined every 10 minutes (side note, bitcoin is also the most reliable universal clock on the planet as well). As bitcoin rises in price more people mine it but every two weeks the difficulty is adjusted to reflect these new additional miners and keep the 10 minute block creation consistent. So when the price rises and more people mine the difficulty gets harder and each miners chance at winning the block lowers. And when prices crashes while the difficulty is high and electricity usage is high aka expensive therefore lower scale miners can’t afford to mine and turn off their machines the difficulty adjusts back down. 
Every ten minutes 12.5 bitcoin are mined. This gets cut in half every 4 years. So in 2008 when they began it was 50 bitcoin per 10 minutes. We are down to 12.5 per ten minutes now and in the 2020 halvening it we lower to 6.25. This will continue until May 7th 2140 when the last bitcoin and fraction of one will be mined. 
Where is the incentive to secure the network when all mining is done in 2140? Currently miners rake in money from mining with the block rewards and from verifying transaction and collected the fees of those transactions. In 2140 it switches to a fee only network and miners become fee collectors. 
Therefore bitcoins monetary policy is already known for over the next 100 years whereas currently we don’t know where interest rates and inflation will be over the next 4 months. Have a mortgage? Might cost 200 more a month by this time next year, etc etc. 
Those are the hard numbers, here is more of personal interpretation. 
Bitcoin is deflationary rather than inflationary.  Many economists argue we saw our greatest technological leaps in humanity when the world was on the gold standard between 1800-1914, much of our current innovation is from the explosion of inventions during that time period. The savings rate for regular workers was much higher as well, being able to save money and not having it lose value over time drastically increases savings whereas currently with the 2%~ of inflation per year if a regular person saves only cash for retirement over their 35 year time horizon of a working period they lose over 50% of their wealth. Regular people being able to store wealth without having to be savvy investors greatly increases the financial health of the overall society. 
Over 17 million of the total 21 million that will ever exist have already been mined. And it is estimated a few million have been lost in the early years when people were brand new with the technology and lost their private keys. So there will likely be less than 18 million ever in circulation. Currently there are over 30 million millionaires in the world making it impossible for every millionaire to own a single bitcoin. That’s just a fun fact I like it really doesn’t mean anything except to emphasize the scarcity. 
It’s my opinion our great grandchildren will look back on the connection between money and state the same way we look back on the connection between church and state. Like we were some dumb barbarians to let a group of a few dozen people sit in a room and decide the value of our money every few months.

Read the bitcoin standard from saifedean ammous. 
Bitcoins stock to flow ratio is high, meaning it won’t be devalued over time by inflating the supply.

Bitcoin will be here. 
When times get bad, when times get worse. 
It doesn’t care when/if we get rich, it will be here when we need it. 
Other stores of wealth are held up by so many different variables that are weighing on each other. 
Bitcoin will still be here.
