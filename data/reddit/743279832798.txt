That the Linux kernel is centralized. Can you not follow this short of a comment chain?

Jesus man, you can't even follow a thread. Do you always confuse having a conversation with "keep trying"? Is that why you're so angsty?

Care to explain how it's wrong?

Your lmao'ing because you don't understand what the parent meant and being pretty arrogant about it. Sure anyone can fork the kernel, or send in pull requests, but the "official" kernel is absolutely centralized, and basically has a single person as the authority.

The confederacy broke away and minted their own currency. Therefore the US currency is not centralized.

You sure do add a lot of condescension to your comments for being so dumb. I clearly mentioned the kernel in my first reply, so it didn't magically get appended, at least from me. 
In any event, "linux" most correctly refers to the kernel, as the rest of the userspace and operating system was provided by GNU. Maybe you're just not old enough to know the history? 
But still, even if we take it to include the GNU tools, or a specific distribution, or whatever, almost every component is centralized in some respect. So you're still wrong. 
Having competition or forks doesn't mean it's decentralized. Maybe you don't really know what decentralized means?
