Did you trade USD directly with slave owners? *You are now!*

30-40% of every currency?

This is just one botnet - 4% of the market cap.
3 million USD in 2012.

Because you hate that I'm confronting the community about it? Or because you have no idea of how to even begin to respond to these problems?

You're forgetting that the BitCoin market cap was *mined* and that it was mined using illegal methods by persons with deeply criminal motives. 30-40% of the Euro market cap was not generated by botnets and child sex slave webcam virus-writers.
If it were, then what would your response to that be?
"Well, how is it different than if the money just -- came from thin air?"

That argument would be valid if 30-50% of all USD GDP originated from Russian mob sex-slave bosses and malware botney-operators.

BTC value was increased through supply and demand, or some other function?
By using botnets to mine massive amounts of BTC they did increase the marketcap because they made the BTC scarcer, and hence more valuable (or so one would think..) to Westerners like you.
Its value is derived from the fact that they obtained so much of it and you want it from them now. By buying BTC you're essentially purchasing the partial rights to your (temporary and virtual) enslavement, if you've ever been part of a botnet.
If these botnet masters dumped their BTC tonight this subreddit's userbase would experience probably 100 suicides tonight.

Is that supposed to absolve you from any guilt you might have from funding mafia and virtual sex-slave operations in Russia?
